Account to account transfers digital wallets QR codes are the most popular digital payment methods

Greater focus needed on building trust in new technologies amidst continued global uncertainty

Consumers in the Asia Pacific region remain among the most enthusiastic adopters of digital payments in the world with 88 percent having used technologies like digital wallets QR codes Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) cryptocurrencies biometrics and others in the last year. What’s more 69 percent of APAC consumers increased their usage of at least one digital payment method during the same period demonstrating momentum. In comparison only 52 percent of consumers in North America and just 48 percent in Europe (regions where consumers tend to be more guarded and cautious about emerging payment technologies) increased their usage in the same way.

The latest data on payment habits attitudes and preferences was published today in Mastercard’s second annual New Payments Index (NPI): a global consumer survey spanning 40 markets across five regions including seven in APAC: Australia China India Japan New Zealand Thailand and Vietnam.

While the COVID-19 pandemic was the catalyst for the unprecedented rapid uptake of digital payments the latest research indicates that the change has been lasting with 40 percent of survey respondents in APAC cutting back on their use of cash in the last year. Despite this swing to digital forms of payment respondents frequently indicated that they had reservations about the security and institutional backing of these new options. In fact when deciding which payment method to use security had the greatest influence on consumer choice beating out discounts/promotions rewards and even low interest rates.

Sandeep Malhotra Executive Vice President Products & Innovation Asia Pacific at Mastercard said “Consumers in the Asia Pacific region have consistently shown a willingness to adopt innovative new technologies—and payments are no exception. Given the sheer speed with which payment options are proliferating coupled with today’s global climate of uncertainty in socio-economic health and political matters it’s important that banks governments and other stakeholders in the financial ecosystem proactively support the sustainable development of these new payment methods including through regulation bolstering security and educating consumers. With reassurances such as these it’s likely we will see even more extensive adoption of emerging payment technologies in the region.”

Notably the APAC report also revealed:

Biometrics unbeatable for convenience and security but privacy worries remain

There’s broad recognition among consumers that using biometric identification such as fingerprint or facial recognition is easier than remembering PINs or passwords (70 percent) and more secure than these traditional methods of verification (69 percent). At the same time only around half (53 percent) of respondents in APAC felt comfortable sharing their biometric data to save time while 72 percent were concerned about which entities would have access to this data. Despite this 58 percent of consumers used biometrics more frequently in the last year demonstrating both an enthusiasm for the technology and untapped potential if providers are able to properly address consumers’ misgivings about privacy.

BNPL awareness is high while comfort is mixed; institutional offerings preferred

APAC is ahead of the curve with BNPL as 50 percent of consumers across the region say they are comfortable using BNPL today while only 41 percent of consumers globally are comfortable using these installment plans. In particular consumers in APAC tap on BNPL offerings for their low/no interest payments in times of emergency and when they want to expedite bigger purchases. Looking ahead 55 percent in APAC say they are likely to use BNPL in the next year. At the same time building trust and comfort is key as APAC consumers feel safer using BNPL solutions backed by a major payment network (67 percent) or their existing bank (65 percent) rather than from other providers.

Broad awareness but relatively low knowledge of new digital currencies and assets

The majority of consumers in APAC have heard of cryptocurrencies (88 percent) non-fungible tokens (NFTs) (68 percent) and other digital assets—but uptake has been gradual. For now the focus is on investment. Among APAC consumers 31 percent (and 44 percent of APAC millennials) report holding crypto as an investment during the past year while future use cases that are popular among respondents include using crypto to redeem rewards invest and make everyday payments. Regarding the latter just under half of respondents (46 percent) want increased flexibility to use crypto for everyday payments.

According to those surveyed more involvement from governments and dependable institutions like banks (cited as the most trusted provider of digital currencies) would boost their confidence in crypto. Diving deeper 60 percent agreed that governments should regulate the cryptocurrency and stablecoin industry while 55 percent would feel more confident investing in crypto or digital currencies that are issued or backed by a reputable organization.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMi0AFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2JpbGx5YmFtYnJvdWdoLzIwMjIvMDgvMjUvdGhlLWZ1dHVyZS1pcy1oZXJlLXZpc2EtbWFzdGVyY2FyZC1hbmQtYmluYW5jZS1hcmUtc3VkZGVubHktbWFraW5nLWJpdGNvaW4tZXRoZXJldW0teHJwLXNvbGFuYS1jYXJkYW5vLWFuZC10ZXRoZXItcGF5bWVudHMtYS1yZWFsaXR5LWRlc3BpdGUtcHJpY2UtY3Jhc2gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'The Future Is Here'—Visa Mastercard And Binance Are Suddenly Making Bitcoin Ethereum XRP Solana Cardano ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2022/08/25/the-future-is-here-visa-mastercard-and-binance-are-suddenly-making-bitcoin-ethereum-xrp-solana-cardano-and-tether-payments-a-reality-despite-price-crash/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMi0AFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2JpbGx5YmFtYnJvdWdoLzIwMjIvMDgvMjUvdGhlLWZ1dHVyZS1pcy1oZXJlLXZpc2EtbWFzdGVyY2FyZC1hbmQtYmluYW5jZS1hcmUtc3VkZGVubHktbWFraW5nLWJpdGNvaW4tZXRoZXJldW0teHJwLXNvbGFuYS1jYXJkYW5vLWFuZC10ZXRoZXItcGF5bWVudHMtYS1yZWFsaXR5LWRlc3BpdGUtcHJpY2UtY3Jhc2gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzhmNDExOTRiLTdkOTEtNDdjYi04NjRmLTk2NGE0MTM3ZGVjMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Visa and Mastercard blame fraud for post-Brexit fee increases,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

But despite this functionality Bitcoin’s role as a payment mechanism has been called into question due to its low transaction throughput.

The Bitcoin blockchain can handle up to seven transactions per second which means that network demand has seen the average transaction fee on the network reach an all-time high above $62 during specific periods.

In order to address low throughput and high transaction fees developers made the Lightning Network — a layer-2 scaling solution that allows for off-chain transactions.

The Lightning Network creates a P2P payment channel between two parties in a transaction. The channel “allows them to send an unlimited amount of transactions that are nearly instant as well as inexpensive. It acts as its own little ledger for users to pay for even smaller goods and services such as coffee without affecting the Bitcoin network.”

Users of the network lock in a certain amount of Bitcoin in order to create a channel. Once the BTC is locked recipients can invoice amounts as they need.

To a certain extent the network is seen as a solution to Bitcoin’s scalability problem but its adoption has been somewhat slow. The network currently has 87000 payment channels and 4570 BTC locked in worth over $111 million compared to the 19.1 million BTC in circulation the market capitalization of which is over $460 billion.

Despite its slow adoption the network has the potential to outcompete existing payment solutions.

Lightning Network’s transaction throughput

Payments giants like Visa and Mastercard are used to process payments worldwide. Mastercard’s network is estimated to process up to 5000 transactions per second making it far superior to Bitcoin’s seven per second.

Visa’s transaction throughput is even more impressive being able to process up to 24000 transactions per second. In a recent interview Visa chief financial officer Vasant Prabhu said that the network could in theory handle up to 65000 transactions per second.

The Lightning Network goes much further however processing up to 1 million transactions per second making it the most efficient payment system in the world in terms of transaction throughput.

RACE OF THE RAILS ‍♂️

WHO WINS?? ⚡️ ⚡️



⁦@CoinCorner⁩ ⁦@CoinCornerMolly⁩ pic.twitter.com/b3ezy7FIeq — Joe Hall - @ Surfin Bitcoin ‍♂️ (@JoeNakamoto) July 25 2022

Cointelegraph reporter Joseph Hall does an impromptu test of the Lightning Network versus fiat contactless payments.

Speaking to Cointelegraph Ovidiu Chirodea CEO of Romanian cryptocurrency exchange Coinzix noted that the network marks the next phase in the evolution of money. Per Chirodea first there was gold which was a store of value but wasn’t a convenient medium of exchange with fiat currency following up as a convenient medium of exchange.

Recent: Tornado Cash saga highlights legal issues affecting the crypto market

Bitcoin Chirodea said was an evolutionary step that created a new store of value with the Lightning Network serving as a platform for it to also become a medium of exchange:

“Visa is charging businesses around 3% to process payments so I think the Lighting Network is a game changer. Companies will increase their revenue by using it and that’s not something that you can ignore.”

He noted however that the network’s scalability “isn’t so great” as users need to open a channel with each party and tie up BTC on it which affects their liquidity. Per his words tying up liquidity can be avoided by “using other routes and other payment channels” but the solution “isn’t very scalable as payments channels keep opening and closing.”

Thomas Perfumo head of business operations and strategy at crypto exchange Kraken told Cointelegraph that since the firm launched Lightning Network support in April 2022 it has “steadily increased network capacity” to the point that it’s now the fifth-largest node on the Lightning Network:

“We currently have over 800 open channels that can facilitate upward of 18 billion satoshis worth of payments. Clients are routinely funding their accounts via the Lightning Network on a daily basis.”

Perfumo added that the exchange sees the Lightning Network as “essential for the creation of a permissionless payment system that will ultimately help accelerate the adoption of cryptocurrencies worldwide.”

While the Lightning Network’s advantages in terms of transaction throughput are now clear it has some notable downsides.

Firstly opening up a Lightning wallet and funding it may not be as easy or as ingrained as opening a bank account and using a debit card.

Furthermore funding a Lightning Network wallet requires users to send BTC from a traditional Bitcoin wallet and creating a payment channel involves locking up funds.

Once funds are locked into a payment channel they can freely transact but the funds can only be recovered after that channel is closed. Moreover offline transaction scams are possible as one party may close a channel when the other is offline to try to steal funds. While third-party services may mitigate the risk it keeps some from entering the network.

Privacy ease of use and censorship-resistance

Keeping these disadvantages in mind Max Rothman head of crypto and digital assets at global payment processor Checkout.com told Cointelegraph that being able to use cryptocurrencies to exchange goods and services “is only effective when crypto can seamlessly exchange hands.”

The Lightning Network being peer-to-peer Rothman added puts the responsibility for the transactions process on both merchants and customers. On an institutional level “This can be challenging and resource-intensive to administer in-house without a trusted partner to manage thousands or millions of cross-currency transactions.”

Rothman said that solutions like the one used by Checkout.com which rely on partner companies like Visa to offer on-ramps that allow for crypto-to-fiat conversions are that “bridge that offers a more seamless translation experience between Web2 and Web3.”

Onboarding the next million or billion people to crypto “requires guidance support and bespoke solutions that work for every level of payment needs and acknowledge the current payments environment in which we operate” he stated.

Speaking to Cointelegraph Bruce Fenton a board member at the Bitcoin Foundation and a candidate for the United States Senate in New Hampshire said the Lightning Network “enables Bitcoin to do more transactions” while being “more decentralized and censorship-resistant than centralized companies or most other chains.”

When asked about the pros and cons of using the Lightning Network over solutions from companies like Visa Fenton dismissed Visa as “entirely centralized” which means it can “be stopped or censored.” While centralization may be a concern on the Lightning Network for some he said that it does not affect the Bitcoin blockchain itself and added:

“It’s mostly about what money you are building on and for. For those who believe in Bitcoin as the superior money LN is the most well-known scaling solution.”

Chad Barraford technical lead at decentralized liquidity protocol THORChain told Cointelegraph that when checking out at online stores the Lightning Network enables a “cash” option in which “there is no other party participating no exorbitant fees and substantial privacy benefits.”

He said that the network is “not solely motivated by the best interests of shareholders or board members” but serves its participants’ interests as a public good adding:

“Visa is a financial institution that inherently seeks profit and control and is at the behest of governments. The Lightning Network is purely a public good. It only exists to provide a fundamental and critical service for every person on the planet in need of access to financial services.”

The Lightning Network’s adoption and success are “tightly coupled with the Bitcoin network itself” Barraford stated. He believes that as the world sees BTC less as a speculative asset and more “like a currency to purchase items” then inflationary pressures “will push more and more people to the Lightning Network.”

While the comparison against networks like that of Visa or Mastercard is clear from these answers it’s worth pointing out that some of these arguments apply to other solutions such as PayPal which can be forced to freeze customers’ assets or charge higher fees for example.

Blockchain technology has been developing over time to the point that other blockchains are also able to compete with Visa’s transaction throughput without seeking to profit from it.

What about other chains?

Speaking to Cointelegraph Fenton hinted that the Lightning Network stands out as “more decentralized and censorship-resistant” than most other blockchains.

Decred co-founder and project lead Jake Yocom-Piatt built on that idea telling Cointelegraph that other blockchains are unable to match the Lightning Network’s qualities.

Yocom-Piatt claimed that the high-throughput blockchain Solana with a theoretical throughput of 710000 transactions per second is a “centralized noncustodial blockchain that requires its validating nodes run in datacenters on high-end hardware.” Comparing the Lightning Network Solana and Decred itself he said:

“Of these three Lightning Network is the most decentralized sovereign and most aligned with the original ethos of the cryptocurrency space. Solana sacrifices most of its decentralization via its onerous validating node requirements but at least it does not appear to be able to censor users and merchants arbitrarily.”

Whatever the future holds it’s clear that innovation in the cryptocurrency space is increasing transaction throughput. Whether users will end up choosing to sacrifice privacy and immutability for more convenience remains to be seen.

As it stands more convenient solutions are available. It’s now easier to use layer-1 blockchains for payments via centralized entities that allow crypto assets to be converted to fiat currencies at the point of sale.

In October 2021 Visa and Mastercard increased cross-border interchange fees on purchases made by UK consumers to European businesses and by European consumers to U.K. businesses. Fees increased from 0.2% to 1.15% for debit cards and 0.3% to 1.5% for credit card transactions. Previously fees had been capped by EU regulation.

In June the U.K.’s Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) detailed plans for two market reviews it focusing on card fees including one that looks at cross-border interchange fees.

Following the PSR launching a probe into the issue in July the Treasury Committee of the U.K. Parliament sent letters to Visa and Mastercard requesting them to explain their increases in cross-border fees.

In the responses of Visa and Mastercard the two payment companies argued similar defenses.

Visa stated that it “does not earn revenue from interchange. Interchange ensures that there is a value transfer between the financial institutions who provide services to both consumers and merchants.”

The firm made the case that the rise in fees was “related to a subset of eCommerce transactions where the merchant is based in the U.K. and the cardholder is in the EEA; or the merchant is based in the EEA and the cardholder is in the U.K. Ecommerce cross-border transactions have unique characteristics including higher risk of fraud and the need for greater vigilance and investment by issuers to ensure their security and efficiency.”

Likewise in Mastercard’s letter the company contested that “interchange is a small fee typically paid by acquirers (the merchant/retailer’s bank) to issuers (cardholder’s bank) to recognize the value delivered to retailers governments and consumers by accepting digital card payments and the costs incurred by such payments. It is not levied on consumers or paid to the card schemes.”

Mastercard also highlighted the risk of fraud as a key factor contributing to higher fees.

It stated that “cross border interchange rates are higher than domestic interchange rates in part because of the value that merchants receive from being able to conduct secure cross border transactions but also the increased functionality required and greater risks (e.g. fraud).”

Commenting on the responses Rt. Hon. Mel Stride MP Chair of the Treasury Committee said:

“All businesses particularly small and medium-sized firms are facing rising costs on many fronts and the increase in cross-border card fees will only add to these pressures. It is vital that these businesses have every opportunity to succeed and are not burdened with disproportionate additional costs at this time.”

By Aditya Kalra

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Tinder-owner Match Group has filed an antitrust case against Apple with the competition regulator in India accusing it of ""monopolistic conduct"" that forces developers to pay high commissions for in-app purchases a legal filing seen by Reuters shows.

Apple is fending off a raft of antitrust challenges around the globe and Match's July filing adds to two other cases in India though Match is the first foreign company to mount such a challenge against the iPhone maker in the country.

Apple and the Competition Commission of India (CCI) did not respond to Reuters queries while a Match spokesperson declined to comment on its filing.

In the previously unreported India filing Match argues Apple's conduct restricts innovation and development of app developers that offer digital services by enforcing the use of its proprietary in-app purchase system and ""excessive"" 30% commission.

A similar dispute in the Netherlands resulted in a 50 million euro fine for Apple and an agreement to allow different payment methods in Dutch dating applications.

The U.S. giant has long mandated use of its in-app payment system which charges commissions that some developers like Match have argued globally are too high.

Match argues in its India filing that users in other countries often prefer to use payment methods which Apple does not permit and in India a state-backed online transfer system was preferred.

""Apple is therefore leveraging its dominant position in the iOS App Store market to promote the exclusive use of its own payment solution"" Mark Buse head of global government relations for Match said in the filing.

In India the CCI in December started investigating allegations from a local non-profit group that alleged Apple's in-app purchase system hurts competition by raising costs for app developers and customers while also acting as a barrier to market entry.

The watchdog ordered the probe after Apple denied any wrongdoing saying it was not the dominant player in India where it has an ""insignificant"" 0-5% market share arguing it was Google's Android that commanded a 90-100% share.

The investigation will now cover each of the three separate cases that have been filed against Apple according to three sources with knowledge of the proceedings.

Match's Tinder is one of India's most popular dating apps and accounted for about 51% of consumer spending in the top five dating apps during the second quarter of this year data from Sensor Tower shows.

In recent years Apple has loosened some restrictions for developers globally like allowing them to use communications - such as email - to share information about payment alternatives outside of their iOS app and lowering commissions for smaller developers to 15%.

""Such commission rate does not apply to the apps of Match's portfolio brands"" Match's filing stated.

Apple says in India 87% of apps on its App Store are those which don't pay any commissions at all.

Match has also complained that Apple considers ride-hailing apps in India such as Uber and SoftBank-backed Ola as those providing ""physical goods/services"" allowing them to provide alternate payment solutions even though they perform ""a similar matchmaking function"" like a dating app.

""Both dating and ridesharing apps share the same fundamental purpose i.e. matching two people online to meet in the real world ... Apple has arbitrarily declared that the two are different"" Match said.

A new world champion will be crowned at Valorant Champions 2022 the culminating tournament of the 2022 VCT season.

Starting August 31 16 of the world’s best teams will descend on Istanbul Turkey where old rivalries will be settled and new ones forged.

The teams have been divided into four groups with teams competing in a double-elimination bracket to determine which two will emerge from each group and move on to the playoffs.

Will China be the force on the global stage that they have been touted to be? Or will North America take back the international crown?

Here are three Valorant Champions 2022 group stage matches you don’t want to miss.

Valorant Champions 2022 group stage: 3 most hotly-anticipated matchups

Paper Rex vs Edward Gaming

Champions is opening with a banger of a match with APAC kings Paper Rex taking on China’s Edward Gaming. Both teams are poised on the cusp of history — this is a Chinese team’s first-ever appearance on the world stage while Paper Rex look ready to improve on their Copenhagen run and finally take Asia’s first international title.

EDG are also fresh off an undefeated campaign in the East Asia Last Chance Qualifier a stunning showing of solid fundamentals and team play.

This match will be the first time both teams have faced each other in the VCT and fans will be treated to a clash of titans known for their aggression. Paper Rex have already made waves with their fearless playstyle and refusal to give opponents any space to work with.

The same may turn out to be true for China and EDG — DAMWON Gaming’s Kim “Lakia” Jong-min has called the aggression of Chinese teams “unimaginable” saying that anyone who played them would “curse at them.”

EDG may also be the one team Paper Rex didn’t want to face. Coming from a team that never seems to show their opponents any respect in-game that should be enough to make anyone sit up and take notice.

Paper Rex and EDG will play each other in Group A on August 31 at 10:00 p.m. GMT+8 | 7:00 a.m. PT | 2:00 p.m. GMT.

Team Liquid vs Leviatán

Following their win at the VCT EMEA Last Chance Qualifier Team Liquid look in better shape than ever. Star player Adil “ScreaM” Benrlitom is in prime form dropping nearly 100 kills in the LCQ final while new addition Dmitriy “dimasick” Matvienko appears to have slotted into the team perfectly.

On the other end is Leviatán one of the dark horses going into the tournament. The team may have exited in joint-fifth place at Copenhagen but they came excruciatingly close to beating a Fnatic squad that was one of the heavy favorites to win it all.

Players like Marco “Melser” Amaro also put on top-tier performances testament to the talent up and down the roster.

While few know what to expect given that both teams have never played each other before this is one matchup that promises to be exceedingly close.

Team Liquid will take on Leviatán in Group A on September 1 at 1:00 a.m. GMT+8 | August 31 10:00 a.m. PT | August 31 5:00 p.m. GMT.

100 Thieves vs Fnatic

It wouldn’t be Valorant without a classic showdown between North America and Europe.

100 Thieves’ return to the global stage sees them donning an entirely different look and Peter “Asuna” Mazuryk is the only familiar face on the roster.

However head coach Sean Gares and Daniel “ddk” Kapadia have molded the team into a well-oiled machine in recent months and this 100 Thieves roster should put all teams at Champions on notice.

Meanwhile Fnatic are hungrier than ever having been denied the championship trophy at multiple international events. Nikita “Derke” Sirmitev and Emir Ali “Alfajer” Beder remain one of the deadliest duos at the tournament and when they are firing on all cylinders Fnatic are nearly unbeatable.

100 Thieves will face Fnatic on September 2 at 10:00 p.m. GMT+8 | 7:00 a.m. PT | 2:00 p.m. GMT.

All matches will be broadcast live on the official Valorant Twitch and YouTube channels.

On Day 1 of Steelers rookie minicamp at the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex on the South Side McCormick worked primarily at right guard a position he barely played while with the Jackrabbits.

Though it remains to be seen if that’s his spot moving forward McCormick is ready for anything when it comes to the Steelers and whatever his role may be.

“I’m ready for whatever they throw at me” McCormick said to reporters on Day 1 of rookie minicamp according to video via Aaron Becker on Twitter. “I just wanna help the organization in any way that I can.”

They wanted us to be as versatile as possible and I think that’s something that can help all of us at the next level.” pic.twitter.com/4oZmz22TpB — Aaron Becker (@Aaron_M_Becker) May 10 2024

That’s largely been McCormick’s mindset since the Steelers drafted him in the fourth round at No. 119 overall.

Though he was primarily a left guard in college McCormick worked out for the Steelers as a center prior to the draft. Now he is getting work at right guard initially in the Black and Gold.

Snaps by position at SDSU for Mason McCormick per PFF Left guard = 3378 👀 Right guard = 19 Center = 15#Steelers #NFL — Steelers Depot 7⃣ (@Steelersdepot) April 27 2024

Having 3378 snaps at left guard seems like it would make for a difficult transition for McCormick to flip sides but that isn’t the case.

“At South Dakota State they prepared me for everything” McCormick said. “They wanted us to be as versatile as possible and I think that’s something that can help all of us at this level.”

It’s certainly going to help McCormick early on.

When the Steelers drafted him it made some sense that he could be the longtime answer at left or right guard with Isaac Seumalo turning 31 and James Daniels entering the final year of his contract as well as backup interior offensive lineman Nate Herbig entering the final year of his contract too.

McCormick’s versatility whether it’s at left guard center or right guard will be key. That should set him up for success long-term and will give Steelers offensive line coach Pat Meyer the ability to simply get the best five linemen on the field at once regardless of true position.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcmdhbmZoLm5ldC9vYml0dWFyeS9qb3NoLW1jY29ybWlja9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary | Josh McCormick of Huntington West Virginia,"LEWISBURG WV - Joshua Howard McCormick 38 of Huntington WV formerly of Lewisburg WV passed away May 3 2024 at home.

While Fautanu and Frazier seem likely to start on Day 1 or at least early in the season McCormick to this point has been viewed more as depth across the interior offensive line. However NFL Media draft analyst Chad Reuter believes McCormick could potentially take over a starting spot at guard for the Steelers and believes the three rookie starters might be an improvement over last season’s offensive line.

“McCormick has the toughness and athleticism to take a starting spot from James Daniels or Isaac Seumalo. Yes that potentially means the Steelers would start three rookies on the offensive line but some Steelers fans might argue McCormick left tackle Troy Fautanu and center Zach Frazier will quickly constitute an improvement over last year’s group despite their lack of experience.”

I find it very very hard to believe that the Steelers would bench one of Seumalo or Daniels for McCormick. While there were some down moments for the most part the two were steady last season and among Pittsburgh’s best offensive linemen. Seumalo in particular brings leadership to a line that will still be very young and it’s really hard to fathom McCormick getting starter reps as a rookie.

Now could he compete with Nate Herbig for the top backup job at guard and potentially win it? Sure but even then McCormick is likely waiting for an injury to get his reps. The more realistic scenario here is that McCormick serves as depth and potentially as the team’s backup center behind Frazier as they worked him out at the position before the draft and he becomes a viable starting option after 2024 when Daniels’ contract will be up. The guard market got expensive in free agency this offseason and Daniels might be looking at a number the Steelers don’t want to pay. McCormick becomes insurance against them overpaying to keep Daniels around should he want a lot of money.

The selection of McCormick was an awesome one to help bolster Pittsburgh’s line depth and add a bully on the offensive line and it’s continually been praised since the draft concluded. But given what the Steelers currently have at guard it’s just hard to fathom the team benching two experienced starters who have been good in Seumalo and Daniels for McCormick. That doesn’t mean McCormick won’t one day be a starter but I’d be shocked if it happened in 2024 without injuries."

LOUISVILLE Ky. — Customers spoke out Wednesday after witnessing kids behind the counter at a Louisville McDonald's restaurant.

Nathan Pitts and his girlfriend Annette Cardwell said they go to the McDonald's on Taylor Boulevard often. However they said Sunday night was their first time seeing underage kids inside.

Cardwell and Pitts said two children were taking and making orders at 11 p.m. Sunday night. Cardwell said they looked as young as 10 years old. The couple added that they were so disgusted by what they saw they immediately asked for their money back.

""Those kids shouldn't have been behind that counter at all"" Cardwell said.

WHAS11 visited the McDonald's Wednesday. The general manager said the owner told her she can't comment on this situation.

A McDonald's spokesperson sent this statement:

We are aware of the incident and can confirm that the minors shown in the video are not employees of the restaurant; they are children of some of our employees. While we are proud to employ many parents and caregivers and understand that sometimes kids may visit a parent's workplace minors who are not employees are not permitted behind the counter. We have taken action to ensure that all of our employees are reminded of our policies regarding visitors.

As for Pitts and Cardwell they said the McDonald's on Taylor Boulevard officially lost two loyal customers.

""I'm not coming back here"" Pitts said.

It will also have a snowball effect on American companies’ climate actions. The Inflation Reduction Act has set aside roughly $369 billion for climate and energy projects and tax credits and the Biden administration has announced a plan to partner with the private sector to tackle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from federal buildings by setting agency emissions reductions targets and investing in energy efﬁciency. The Department of Defense also came out with a request for information (RFI) asking federal suppliers if they would be capable of providing their GHG accounting data.

This flurry of federal climate action will create a domino effect on federal suppliers and beyond. What will this mean for your company? Let’s dig in.

It probably will not surprise you that the U.S. government buys a lot of stuff. During the Obama administration one of us (Mike) met Jed Ela Nancy Gillis and Kate Brandt who all worked in Washington D.C. for the federal government while Mike was representing the Global Reporting Initiative in North America.

This flurry of federal climate action will create a domino effect on federal suppliers and beyond. What will this mean for your company?

Their work in collaboration with many others resulted in a little-known but very influential ripple through the U.S. government's own supply chain the Federal Supplier Greenhouse Gas Management Scorecard. The original scorecard was published in 2015 and listed the government’s main suppliers including information on whether those companies disclosed their emissions and climate risks or whether they had set a carbon reduction target.

When it was published it fueled a great deal of conversation between companies and stakeholders in the ﬁeld. It was a precedent-setting and bold way to allow all interested stakeholders to see whether and how these companies were taking action.

The 2020 iteration of the scorecard provided a more detailed climate action overview on more than 100 companies including whether they publicly disclose their emissions (via CDP) or have set GHG targets.

The progression of the government’s scorecard is indicative of where carbon reporting is headed. At ﬁrst stakeholders just wanted to know whether a company reports. Now they want companies to commit to annual disclosure and prove credibility through alignment with widely adopted carbon disclosure and emissions-reduction initiatives.

In addition to the federal scorecard the Biden administration’s climate agenda linked procurement as a core part of the government’s ambition to create a net-zero economy by 2050. This is an important piece of the puzzle. It means affected companies (federal suppliers and companies subject to the SEC’s proposed climate rule) will likely be required as early as 2023 to conduct independent audits and provide assurance on the accuracy of the emissions data they disclose.

As seen in the scorecards many companies are already disclosing GHG emissions and targets to CDP and some are going well beyond that. Lockheed Martin for example is also publishing a TCFD report an ESG report and an ESG Performance Index.

""Transparency in our environmental social and governance performance represents our commitment to working collaboratively to achieve sustainability goals that will yield positive outcomes for customers employees shareholders and other stakeholders"" said Leo Mackay Lockheed Martin’s senior vice president of ethics and enterprise assurance who leads the company’s sustainability program and reports on its progress to the CEO and board of directors. ""Our continued focus on energy and carbon management include Scope 1 and 2 carbon reduction goals as well as steps to increase visibility of and where appropriate to develop a reduction strategy for key Scope 3 emissions.""

Everyone is in someone’s supply chain

As federal suppliers are required to report their GHG emissions to the government requests for GHG data will ripple across markets. The full extent of an organizations’ GHG emissions can be organized into Scopes 1 2 and 3. We’ll focus here on Scope 3.

According to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol) and the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials every institution’s value chain needs to be accounted for when calculating its Scope 3 emissions. More simply Scope 3 includes the goods and services your organization has chosen to procure to do business as well as the GHG emissions of its purchased goods and services. As federal agencies ask their suppliers to account for their GHG emissions those companies in turn will need to ask all their suppliers for GHG emissions data as well.

For example if the DoD asks the healthcare supplier McKesson to provide its GHG emissions McKesson will begin the process of calculating its footprint including Scope 3 (assuming it hasn’t already). From there the company will likely ask its suppliers for their GHG emissions regardless whether those companies are also federal suppliers. In its latest Sustainability Impact Report (PDF) McKesson disclosed that it is working with its suppliers to set science based targets for emissions tracking and reduction which will in turn help McKesson itself reduce its Scope 3 emissions.

While it is also possible to calculate Scope 3 by using spend-based formulas that simply multiply the amount of money spent or the amount of goods purchased by emissions factors based on industry averages it is more accurate to collect actual emissions data directly from suppliers. Suppliers are likely already receiving GHG emissions questionnaires from customers perhaps at extremely high volumes. To deal with the high demand for this information a number of surveying and rating companies have cropped up to gather ESG data on companies including their GHG emissions.

Still there are challenges for federal suppliers in calculating Scope 3 particularly for those providing goods and services to national security-related departments such as NASA the DoD and the Department of Homeland Security. As an example some companies cannot include sensitive confidential information for the Scope 3 category ""Use of Sold Products"" which requests data on the breakdown of the emissions the end-user generates after purchasing and using the product.

A global phenomenon

This isn’t happening only in the United States; the U.K. is directly asking government suppliers to disclose their GHG emissions as part of its own procurement requirements aimed at accelerating progress toward the U.K.’s target of net zero by 2050. For emissions reporting major government suppliers are already required to provide Scope 1 and 2 emissions and a subset of Scope 3 emissions including upstream and downstream transportation and distribution.

Other EU jurisdictions have their own means of ensuring that companies' supply chains not only disclose their emissions but reduce them as well. For example the Netherlands has a CO2 Performance Ladder which is being considered for the entire EU. It provides companies that are accurately disclosing their emissions and have a strategy to reduce them with a certiﬁcate potentially giving them a competitive advantage.

The snowball effects of world governments setting ambitious climate goals and creating sustainable procurement policies cast a wide net across global supply chains sparing no company from having to get a handle on the GHG information. Nearly every company of any size is in someone's supply chain. The best thing a company can do if it hasn’t already is prepare to measure manage and reduce those emissions. The time to get started is now.",,,,,,,,,

CEO Geoff Martha told investors during the company's fiscal first quarter (Q1 2023) earnings call that supply chain disruptions inflation hospital labor shortages COVID-related procedure delays/cancellations and foreign exchange factors – along with difficult comparisons to the prior year – caused revenue and earnings per share to decline.

""At the same time there were several bright spots in the quarter across our businesses including strength in pacing cardiac surgery U.S. core spine neurovascular diabetes in Europe and strong overall growth in many emerging markets"" Martha said according to The Motley Fool's transcript of Medtronic's earnings call.

He also noted several near-term pipeline catalysts that are expected to accelerate growth.

TAVR is one of Medtronic's largest growth drivers

Martha said the limited U.S. market release of the Evolut FX transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) system (shown above) is receiving ""an overwhelmingly positive customer reception.""

The CEO said the Evolut FX enhances ease of use and provides implanters with greater precision and control during the procedure and it maintains all of the hemodynamic and durability benefits of the Evolut platform.

""When you combine the FX launch in U.S. PRO+ launch in Europe and Evolut PRO launch in China we feel really good about the opportunities in our TAVR franchise around the globe. TAVR is one of the largest growth drivers for Medtronic and we expect the market which is roughly $5.5 billion today to exceed $7 billion within the next three years and reach $10 billion in the next five years.""

Medtronic plans to disrupt the single-chamber ICD market

In cardiac rhythm management Martha said Medtronic looks forward to disrupting the single-chamber ICD market with its Aurora extravascular implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD).

""Now as you may know one of our competitors has had a subcutaneous ICD in the market for many years"" he said most likely referring to Boston Scientific's Emblem S-ICD. ""But it's remained a niche device given its limitations compared to conventional ICDs. With Aurora we've created a true game changer where the electrophysiologist and the patient don't have to make trade-offs.""

The device is expected to deliver the benefits of a traditional ICD including the same size battery longevity and ability to use proven antitachy pacing in lieu of delivering a painful shock to terminate life-threatening arrhythmias.

""Aurora does all of this without having to place leads inside the heart"" Martha said.

Medtronic plans to present EV-ICD global pivotal data this weekend at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Congress in Barcelona Spain. The company is also awaiting CE mark approval for Aurora and expects FDA approval next calendar year the CEO noted.

'Never Gonna Give You Up'

Despite earlier disappointments in renal denervation Medtronic's persistance in the space may soon pay off.

Martha said the company is nearing completion of the six-month follow-up for the full cohort of patients in the company's SPYRAL HTN-ON MED study. Medtronic will then analyze the data and plan to present the findings in the next few months he said. This data is expected to complete the final piece of the company's clinical module submission to FDA as every other module has been submitted reviewed and closed.

""The data on our Symplicity blood pressure procedure is robust including strong pivotal trial results and compelling real-world registry data from over 3000 patients"" Martha said. ""And more recently data has been presented that show already in-patient spend nearly double the time and target blood pressure range through three years than those who received a sham procedure. This could have a profound effect on public health through the reduction of cardiovascular events including stroke heart failure and [cardiovascular] mortality.""

And after all of the company's trials and tribulations in renal denervation it was no surprise to hear Martha say Medtronic expects to be a leader in this market which the company projects to exceed $500 million by 2026 and $2 billion to $3 billion by 2030.

Medtronic is 'investing heavily' in surgical robotics

Medtronic continues to execute on the limited market release of its Hugo robot (shown below) Martha told investors during Monday's call. He said the company is installing new systems and collecting clinical data in approved geographies enhancing the system based on surgeon feedback improving supply chain resiliency and scaling manufacturing production. Feedback and demand continue to be ""very strong"" he said.

Martha said the company has made progress over the last quarter and is nearing the start of a U.S. investigational device exemption trial for a urology indication with the Hugo robot.

The company also continues to increase its user base of Touch Surgery Enterprise its AI-powered surgical video and analytics platform. With Touch Surgery Enterprise surgeons can now easily review film from their surgeries to continuously improve and advance patient care Martha noted.

""Overall when it comes to surgical robotics we're investing heavily to become a major player in the market for the long term leveraging our decades of experience and leadership in minimally invasive surgery"" Martha said.

As Vijay Kumar a medtech analyst at Evercore pointed out during the Q&A portion of the earnings call Martha's commentary on the Hugo robot carried a notable ""change in tone"" compared to the company's previous earnings call with the CEO sounding much more bullish on the company's momentum in the surgical robotics space. That's largely because Medtronic has made significant progress on some of the supply chain concerns it previously had and resolved some specific issues as well as its manufacturing capacity challenges Martha explained. He also emphasized expanded sales in Europe.

""We had a number of installs and continue to get good feedback"" Martha said. ""And the surgeon feedback continues to be really strong. ... the word is out. They like the design. They like the approach we're taking to the market. And they realize that when we launch we won't have all the indications yet and we're going to be building out our instrument on the number of instruments we have with it but they want to be part of this journey with us.""

Closing the loop on pain

Martha also updated investors on the company's neuroscience portfolio noting that it has submitted its Inceptiv evoked compound action potential (ECAP) closed-loop spinal cord stimulation (SCS) technology designed to optimize pain relief for patients. He said the technology is expected to ""revolutionize the SCS market.""

Now turning to our neuroscience portfolio. In neuromodulation we've submitted our inceptive ECAPs closed-loop stimulator. We expect inceptive's closed-loop therapy which optimizes pain relief for patients to revolutionize the SCS market.

The company also continues to ramp commercial activities to go after the diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) opportunity with its first cohort of DPN market development reps now trained Martha said.

""We believe DPN is one of the largest opportunities in medtech and we expect the market to reach $300 million by FY '26 with an annual total addressable market of up to $2 billion"" he noted.

Progress on diabetes warning letter

In diabetes Martha said Medtronic is in active dialogue with FDA on the company's regulatory submission for the MiniMed 780G with the Guardian 4 sensor and ""we remain focused on resolving our warning letter.""

Late last year FDA slapped Medtronic with a warning letter after an inspection that concluded in July 2021 related to a recall of the company's MiniMed 600 series insulin infusion pump and a remote controller device for MiniMed 508 and Paradigm pumps. The warning letter focuses on the inadequacy of specific medical device quality system requirements at the company's Northridge CA facility in the areas of risk assessment corrective and preventive action complaint handling device recalls and reporting of adverse events.

Martha said the company has completed more than 90% of the actions it committed to FDA.

In the company's continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) pipeline Medtronic submitted its next-generation sensor Simplera for CE mark.

""Simplera is disposable. It's easier to apply and it's half the size of Guardian 4"" Martha said. ""The Simplera file is ready to submit to the U.S. FDA and we're waiting to submit it as we're prioritizing the 780G Guardian 4 review. And with regards to our overall diabetes pipeline we're making considerable investments well above our corporate R&D average.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxhdy5jb20vY29ycGNvdW5zZWwvMjAyMi8wOC8yNC9tZWR0cm9uaWMtc2hvd2VyZWQtbmV3LWdjLXdpdGgtc3RvY2stZ3JhbnRzLXByb3h5LXNob3dzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Medtronic Showered New GC With Stock Grants Proxy Shows | Corporate Counsel,"Ivan Fong who became medical device giant Medtronic’s general counsel Feb. 1 received compensation totaling $11.7 million in his first few months on the job according to the company’s recently filed proxy statement.

It is yet another Class I recall for the device which Medtronic stopped selling more than a year ago as problems mounted. The medtech giant’s move ceded the LVAD space to Abbott.

Medtronic recalled the HeartWare Ventricular Assist Device (HVAD) batteries (model number 1650DE) because they may experience electrical faults that cause them to fail unexpectedly. Such an occurrence means the batteries may be unable to power the controller unable to accept a charge from the battery charger or appear to remain charged when in use.

If the battery fails and the patient is unable to replace the failed battery with a charged working battery or with AC or DC power the HVAD may stop working leading to serious injury or death according to the FDA notice.

The medtech giant has recalled 23372 devices distributed from Jan. 1 2009 to the present day after initiating the recall on June 28 2022. To date Medtronic has reported 1159 complaints six injuries and one death related to the issue.

Medtronic’s HVAD system helps the heart continue to pump blood to the rest of the body as a bridge to cardiac transplants in patients who are at risk of death from end-stage left ventricular heart failure for heart tissue recovery or as destination therapy (DT) in patients for whom heart transplants are not planned.

As part of the company’s June 28 urgent medical device correction letter regarding the issue — as well as a previous battery recall — telling customers to address the battery electrical fault by keeping two sources of power connected to their controller and have fully charged spare batteries available at all times.

Users should also acknowledge and report alarms follow instructions for use for proper power source management. They should also be vigilant if battery indicator lights don’t decrease over time while the battery is in use.

The recall is the latest hurdle for Medtronic’s HVAD which last year saw its instructions for use and patient manual recalled due to risks from dropping the case incorrect installation and misinterpretation of an alarm signal. That recall included 130716 devices in the U.S. distributed from March 2006 to the present (Feb. 26 2021) with one death and 64 injuries reported.

Medtronic’s Feb. 26 recall also covered problems associated with HeartWare controller ports that the FDA announced in April 2021. The agency reported 12 deaths 855 complaints and eight reports of injuries — figures that the company disputed.

In December 2020 Medtronic recalled its HeartWare HVAD pump implant kit because the device may fail to start restart or delay restarting after the pump was stopped. The FDA confirmed that recall in March reporting with it two related deaths."

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL21lcmNrLXRyZWF0bWVudC10eXBlLXV0ZXJ1cy1jYW5jZXItZmFpbHMtdHJpYWwtMjAyNC0wNS0wOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-treatment-type-uterus-cancer-fails-trial-2024-05-09/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL21lcmNrLXRyZWF0bWVudC10eXBlLXV0ZXJ1cy1jYW5jZXItZmFpbHMtdHJpYWwtMjAyNC0wNS0wOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTbSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWFsdGguZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,"Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals Subscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.

Yuval Boger: Hello Thomas and thank you for joining me today.

Thomas Ehmer: Hi Yuval pleasure.

Yuval: So who are you and what do you do?

Thomas: That’s a good question Yuval and because I know the podcast I prepared a bit. I’m a bit of a superposition and it depends really on whom you ask. So for my band I’m the keyboard player for my kids I am the dad. But I think for this podcast I’ll tell you what I’m doing in my business. I’m one of the co-founders in the Merck group Merck KGaA. We are not Merck & Co. so there are two different independent companies. We have to tell this every time. So if you listen from the US we operate under EMD Serono. Rest of world we are Merck KGaA. And some eight years ago I was looking for novel technologies. I’m still looking for novel technologies and we did found a quantum task force with the objective to check if it makes sense that our company takes care of quantum technologies. It does. Yeah and then I’m a physicist by training. I look mainly at all applications that are novel to our company and should make sense. I’m a bit of a troublemaker because I bring technologies in-house that we don’t know yet how to use or we want to use but don’t have budget and so on. So that’s what I do for a living. Eight years

Yuval: wow.

Thomas: Yes.

Yuval: Really one of the pioneers. So let’s go back eight months. What have you learned in the last eight months about quantum and quantum readiness that maybe you didn’t know before that?

Thomas: Eight months is February. What did I learn in the last eight months? So I think what is confirming is that we have a very good emerging quantum computing community. I very much like all these conferences and it’s always good to see that we independent on whom you ask it seems that we are a community who wants to work together. Yeah and I think this is as some might say we approach quantum winter. We don’t know. But I think it’s good to see that there are still some brave people who carry the flag and work together. I see also that a lot of novel quantum computing architectures make it close to the market or are close to the market. So it’s really good to see. And I mean personally I was keen to see the recent announcement from Quantinuum for example where they have for example logical qubits apparently entangled. Eight years ago we didn’t even know how to build a single qubit. Now we have logical qubits at least in some claim that they have and I trust them. So this is interesting to see. And also the quantum communication part people are really getting keen on all these quantum key distribution communication protocols and so on. So that’s yeah. There’s not a single thing. I think it’s just really exploding. That’s good to see how far we move.

Yuval: In your company what do you see as the key application for quantum? Is it drug discovery or is it more things like optimization supply chain and so on?

Thomas: It depends on whom you ask. So we are super interested in quantum applications because once they come if ever they come they might be transformative. There’s so much hope and hype on drug discovery. Personally I’m not really a big fan or believer that computational drug discovery is outperforming wet drug discovery. So that’s my personal take. I think it’s a partnership and everybody’s betting on artificial intelligence. So drug discovery is a very complex thing and computational methods. Quantum computing is an additional computational method. So I think it’s a long way. There’s a very good paper out from the colleagues from Boehringer who did investigate if quantum computing ever will work. So it looks like we need new algorithms. So that’s my take. And the other problems logistics problems this is how it started for me actually to dive into quantum computing. So some years back the D-Wave were the first ones on the market with their traveling salesperson optimization. I still think it’s a miracle that we have these annealing things. And apparently so these ultra wicked complex problems might benefit also from quantum computing. I’m a bit undecided. I mean we see the three classes simulation optimization and machine learning. And yeah for our company none of them currently is relevant from an application perspective. But if they will come to maturity likely the material sciences is also of important.

Yuval: It’s very popular these days to talk about chat GPT moment a moment where AI moved from science fiction to we got to do it now. What do you think the quantum chat GPT or the quantum GPT moment is going to look like?

Thomas: The quantum that I have no clue. So I think the GPT moment was when everybody and their sister and brother were exposed to a functionality they could never imagine which is mimicking human intelligence. Actually it does not but it’s mimicking and it’s very convincing. So I think we will see how this develops compared to quantum. I have actually no clue. I could imagine that eventually something like this communication protocols might have an impact if everybody could just plug in whatever app to have a quantum secured point to point communication without any agency being able to listen in without me knowing they listen in. So this might be eventually one of these which has mass impact because I think quantum computing per se is rather an expert-ish niche co-processor thing. So I’m not sure how to. It’s a good question. I have to ask my guys what they think.

Yuval: You mentioned community earlier. And I know you’re part of a community of several I think German companies that work together to develop quantum. Could you tell me a little bit about that? And also related to that are you worried about other pharma companies about collaborating with other pharma companies to do quantum or right now a rising tide lifts all boats?

Thomas: Yes. So the yes is to the last question. So the company you mentioned at the beginning so it’s an association called QUTAC stands for German Quantum Technology Application Consortium. We have a very cool homepage. And it’s an association of the 13 big German companies. I don’t want to mention them all because otherwise the podcast would be over. What we are doing we organize ourselves in several streams and with the focus to identify quantum technology use cases that we could work on either as developers or co-developers or application user guidance for the developers. Independent from our own let’s say business. For example we work together with automotive or pharma and reinsurers logistics companies on let’s say logistics problems. Everybody has their problems and we test out different approaches on knapsack etc. So that’s one thing. And the other thing is we share the burden to evaluate vendors potential service providers. And by being attractive enough if as a partner you manage to convince QUTAC you not only have one customer but you would have 13 customers. So that’s the main point. And also I think it’s very helpful. All of us have relatively small quantum teams. So these are big worldwide corporations. I mean BMW SAP Bühringer etc. And all have relatively small quantum teams. And it’s very comfortable for us as a team to not be alone so that we have a bit of a peers and we can share interests. Regarding the pharma guys I mean it started I think at the Q2B several years back. There was an initiative that we all say everybody claims we can speed up drug discovery or drug development or we can bring better drugs to the world by quantum computing. Who knows how this works? Nobody did. So it’s also very open very collaborative. And I think it’s rather a friend-ish approach bosonic approach that we work together instead of competition because currently it’s really pre-competitive. There’s also the Pistoia Alliance who is setting up one pharma consortium thing. There are several pharma consortiums emerging. So that’s quite open. And the third part I forgot. Now I think you answered everything here.

Yuval: When you think about QUTAC what is the issue that you’re facing right now? What is the key thing that you’re looking for a solution?

Thomas: So we have different streams. So one stream we started focusing on the logistics and the material sciences streams. It looks like currently we have reshuffled a bit. So one part of us is looking at generative components. So we’re working on quantum generative network so QGANs to check in how far they perform better than classical GANs. We have a paper out. You can make sense yourself if it’s worthwhile or not. I mean it’s early days but this is where we jointly work on because everybody is interested of course in these generative networks. The other thing is in the logistics part we work on knapsack problems to understand can quantum do better knapsack things. And there’s another stream which is composed of different people. They work mainly on material science topics so quantum chemistry using quantum computers. I don’t have too much insight in that but it’s always shared problems that we say how can you better do ground energy finding whatever. What is quantum Monte Carlo? Where does it make sense? Where does it not make sense? And the third stream I mentioned is really looking at infrastructure from different perspectives. So we are also writing there some papers with the target audience of being other quantum computing users to guide them if it makes sense to go on neutral atoms. I mean you know neutral atoms or we’re just working on an ion trap paper. And the other part is also political communication. And in principle also we wanted to do a bit of education so help grow talent for our companies. But that’s not so far progressed as we would have wanted just due to the lack of resource we have.

Yuval: You mentioned the comparison between computational chemistry or using quantum computing for computational chemistry versus wet labs. In a company like Merck how much communication is there between the people who are actually working on developing drugs and people like yourself who are dealing with future technologies?

Thomas: That’s a good question. So I think there is enough communication. There is even a common ground. There are just not enough solutions. I mean we have recently discussed the potential to do I don’t know what was this the idea to use quantum computer annealing approaches to find binding pockets in complex targets. And when I talk to our researchers who do the wet stuff or other computational stuff they said it sounds interesting. On the other hand we already have 15 methods or 20 methods and I have 15 people so I just don’t have capacity to digest this. So I think there is an appetite that it’s really tough to understand this added value given that you have new ways of thinking. So quantum algorithm is using quantum features nobody really understands what these are even the quantum guys don’t. And then I mean how to translate your existing problems in a way that you can make additional value for using quantum components or quantum core processor. That’s not easy. And unfortunately most have objectives that are not so much forward looking and have time to think what will be happening in 10 5 years because in the end you need to deliver the next target. And it’s just a bit of operational pressure. I mean it’s a bit of a dance and mainly of interest so people listening with interest but it’s just currently it’s more playful with the intent to detect good things but it’s not a threat currently if we would not look at it I think.

Yuval: Do you see a need for a company like Merck to purchase a quantum computer anytime soon in the next few years or everything is on the cloud as far as you’re concerned?

Thomas: I mean there are different answers to that. I think it depends on what you want to achieve so if we want to contribute as a material supplier for example because we have the very best isotopes and the very best gas to do nitrogen vacancy whatever stuff well so do we need a quantum computer for that? Maybe not. If we want to learn to program it there are so many solutions out in the cloud. I doubt that we need one in-house. And then there’s on the other hand the approach that the American clinics currently are doing. So every clinic who thinks they have interest in novel technologies they put a quantum computer on site which is then I think rather a symbol because if every day you pass a quantum computer eventually it triggers your way of thinking what could I do with it? So I think for this sake more as a symbol it could make sense. And I mean it looks good. The machines depending on which machines you use but I think definitely from a productive use point it doesn’t make sense this moment in time. I would not even know whom to hire to maintain and operate these things because they are very fragile and you need to calibrate all these. And then the question is also which technology do you want to have? So you would need to buy one of each flavors modalities how they’re called. I would not know what to choose. So therefore I think it’s also not from a financial investment. Maybe it’s not a good value investment because the next generation makes the other one obsolete. So it’s not that it’s getting more and more from a collector’s viewpoint that you can collect. I have the very first I don’t know a QuEra machine and then I put it somewhere. I have the very first IBM machine with 127 qubits. I think it doesn’t make sense.

Yuval: Germany is one of the countries that’s investing heavily in quantum on the national level. And do you feel some of the results of this investment or do you think it’s going to be years out?

Thomas: So personally I feel some of it because I’m also profiting from a federal funded project which I’m very grateful for because otherwise we would not do this project because it’s just too risky. And because we have this funding I can spend part of my time to think on things I would not think for. And the interesting part is that I think we heard this on several talks also on conferences that because you think on quantum algorithms you detect sometimes solutions that are completely independent from quantum that help your business nevertheless. So that’s one aspect. Do I see other… I mean Germany spends a lot of money. The UK does France does. Others do too. I can’t really say that I have seen quick returns but I see that there is a lot of attention and even a bit of understanding in the decision makers. It’s moving into a direction which is at least they want to understand what it is and it’s quite complex but I think it’s more technology friendly these days than it was in the past. Unfortunately we have the situation in the world. So I think everywhere funds are cut for fundamental research. But I mean that’s I think independent from the aim that we want to spend much money on that. I mean one thing on the other hand is what I find a bit disappointing is that we have a bit of this fragmentation in Germany. We have all the land and everybody wants to do their own valley. So we have a quantum valley in Munich we have a Saxony valley. So in Germany everybody is a bit of building their own center and everybody is in the center of their world. I’m not sure how this is in other countries. I think France is by definition different that everything goes to Paris and then you have to see what’s coming out there. But the original question is yes I think it makes sense. You slowly see. I think we’re a bit far behind. Others started earlier and have more mature startup scenes but we’re catching up.

Yuval: You spoke earlier about the quantum winter and also mentioned that you’ve been doing this for eight years. Do you think there is a risk that a company like Merck says you know what we’ve been at this for a while. Let’s shelve it and come back in three years and maybe things will be different.

Thomas: I think there is in principle the risk because we are not doing this as a profession. Everybody’s doing this as their hobby. We have a very small team under our digital just forget but we have a central function and we have a digital unit. And somewhere in this area we have a unit who is doing quantum and AI lab. And these are not many people. And they spend a very small part of the time doing what they do. And what I’m doing thanks to my boss and my boss’s boss and everything so I am doing this on top of my job. I have zero budget except the federal funding so there is not much to cut. Because otherwise it’s late in the evening we have this call after business hours. So I think many people are committed despite not having money because it’s not like in other companies where you have a really a small team and hire a few students. For us it’s relatively small. And I rather see that we are doing more than is visible to the top management. And when we did this task force people were surprised how active we are. If you’re not in the field of course you don’t see it. But then when you say we should do something about quantum computing you see that we’re relatively well networked. I think that’s… Does this answer the question?

Yuval: Absolutely. So hypothetically if you could have dinner with one of the quantum greats dead or alive who would that person be?

Thomas: I’m prepared so I’m not so… I don’t fake surprise. And it took me a long time to think. And I’m in a very lucky position that I already had lunch with some of my idols they’re alive. Therefore I go for the dead ones. And this is a tough thing. I think I would go for David Bohm or John Wheeler because I really like the way they put more into quantum which has to do with consciousness research self-perception the miracles of the observer what is the observer so the bigger picture. Currently I’m tending in my philosophical interpretation of the word a bit to the monistic view which is maybe a bit over-exaggerated. But the miracle that we have something which is self-perception and we have something which is an external world. And how come? We don’t know. And there are so many different interpretations and I think Bohm did a very good… with his implicate order he had a very good idea to think about that we need new ways of expressing ourselves if I understood this correct. And I’ve seen some rare interviews back on YouTube with him and he seems to be a very super interesting person. But he’s dead unfortunately so no chance.

Yuval: Very well. Thomas thank you so much for joining me today.

Thomas: Yeah thanks for having me. It was a pleasure.

META,Meta Platforms,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbnN0aXR1dGlvbmFsaW52ZXN0b3IuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMmJzdG9nYm1qbXpudnJtajJlbzc0L29waW5pb24vZnJvbS1tZXRhLXRvLXR3aXR0ZXItd2hhdC1ldmVyeW9uZS1nZXRzLXdyb25nLWFib3V0LWVzZy1hbmQtd2h5LWl0LW1hdHRlcnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,From Meta to Twitter What Everyone Gets Wrong About ESG — And Why It Matters,"Frances Haugen chose to join Facebook after a family member became radicalized online. She wanted to help make the social media platform less toxic. As she would later testify before Congress however she found that she had joined a company that persistently put profit before the broader social good.

“I saw Facebook repeatedly encounter conflicts between its own profits and our safety. Facebook consistently resolved those conflicts in favor of its own profits” Haugen told Congress in 2021. “The company’s leadership knows ways to make Facebook and Instagram safer and won’t make the necessary changes because they have put their immense profits before people.”

Haugen brought receipts. She provided Congress and the press with a trove of internal documents showing how Facebook and its senior leadership including CEO and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg knew of the damage their product was doing. In the ensuing firestorm the Menlo Park California-based social media company changed its name to Meta Platforms and Sandberg announced she was stepping down from the company.

In coming forward the whistleblower believed what she was doing “was right and necessary for the common good.”

While Haugen’s testimony highlighted the conflict between Facebook’s financial success and the public interest a similar but largely hidden conflict exists between the company’s executives and most of its shareholders: While Meta’s antisocial actions might buoy its stock price and create wealth for senior leaders the socially destructive nature of these activities is a threat to the diversified portfolios of its own shareholders.

Most individual and institutional investors including pension plans and endowments are not concentrated in a single stock. They hold diversified portfolios. But when Meta threatens the public interest to drive up its own value it can compromise the long-term value of the economy that supports these portfolios.

In our complex economy decisions by a single company can have profound effects on almost every other company an investor owns. Meta’s decisions can degrade public discourse instill social unrest and undermine efforts to create an informed public reducing the intrinsic value of the economy which is directly correlated with the long-term performance of diversified portfolios.

This is why we at The Shareholder Commons (TSC) have supported shareholder proposals at companies including Meta Alphabet BlackRock UPS McDonald’s Corp. and Tractor Supply Co. urging them to report on the negative costs of their business practices to diversified investors. Addressing this conflict is why I founded TSC three years ago following a 30-year career as a corporate governance lawyer: I believe that directors fail to meet their fiduciary duties when they ignore negative impacts on their own diversified shareholders.

And yet most institutional investors including those that analyze a company’s impact on the environment social responsibilities and corporate governance (so-called ESG factors) fail to address this conflict.

The ESG Explosion

Investors’ concern for social and environmental issues has increased exponentially with close to one-third of global managed assets now falling under some form of ESG mandate.

But this interest focuses almost exclusively on the relationship between a company’s choices and its own financial performance.

To fulfill the potential of ESG investors must understand that company executives also have a conflict of interest with their diversified shareholders. Naming this conflict is not an ethical judgment; it simply describes a market economy that channels savings to thousands of individual businesses competing for capital talent and margin. But we need to identify the inherent conflict so we can design mechanisms to address it.

Recognizing the conflict is also critical in responding to the accelerating political pushback against ESG investing. With the support of corporate lobbyists lawmakers in a number of states have passed legislation that will hamper the ability of institutional investors to use ESG risk assessments in their investing practices or even invest with managers that use ESG criteria. Highlighting the divergent interests of corporate managers and their diversified shareholders will help explain why such legislation is so dangerous to investors.

Refocusing investors on portfolio impacts may require that they demand individual companies in their portfolios make decisions that reduce enterprise value — even over the long term. This runs counter to the “doing well by doing good” narrative that ESG activists cling to as well as the ethos of an ecosystem that equates success with financial outperformance. But to maintain a market economy that does not violate critical social and environmental boundaries shareholders must insist that each company account for all of the costs of its activities — including those costs that it can externalize.

Elon Musk’s attempt to purchase Twitter is an excellent example of this conundrum. Even though the offered price might have provided shareholders with the best value the sale of a critical social media platform to one individual with very particular economic and other interests may have threatened the integrity of the public square. And because the economy depends on healthy public discourse ensuring that Twitter is a positive social force long into the future is likely more financially material to the diversified shareholders of Twitter than is receiving a premium for their shares today. Yet no ESG investors made this case or sought to condition support of the transaction on public-square protections. Because this critical “S” interest runs contrary to maximizing financial returns at Twitter the ESG community has remained largely silent even as the company tries to force Musk to follow through on his agreement in Delaware Chancery Court. As long as investors focus on enterprise value alone they will repeat this mistake and will miss the opportunity to secure long-term portfolio value.

Corporate Law and the Davos Denizen

I spent the first 25 years of my career as a lawyer in Delaware the most important corporate law jurisdiction in the world and the crucible where fiduciary duty law is developed. I worked with directors executives and bankers as they tried to raise money auction companies or stave off hostile bidders. I also worked with large shareholders and bidders pushing companies to sell or change course.

All through this work the North Star guiding my advice (and arguments to judges) was unquestioned: The job of directors and the executives they oversaw was to optimize the company’s financial return to shareholders. Sometimes directors overseeing the sale of a company would ask me about protecting workers after the sale. As legal adviser I thought it was my job to say that if the company was being sold for cash all that mattered was the price to shareholders.

There is an economic logic to this answer. We rely on competitive markets to price things including inputs like petroleum and labor — but also companies. We rely on those prices to allocate scarce resources. So the theory goes we should encourage business decisions that maximize profits because higher profits mean more value is being created which means resources are being allocated optimally: We are growing the pie. Under this view it is the role of government — not executives — to protect workers the environment and other common goods. Indeed if executives tried to balance all these different interests the economy would go awry.

Of course not everyone believes this. Academic and policy arguments as to why corporate fiduciaries should look beyond shareholder financial return are common. But since the late 20th century lawyers directors and executives have all bought into an artificially narrow version of shareholder primacy. This remains true even for most proponents of “stakeholder capitalism” such as the Business Roundtable and the World Economic Forum. While these organizations make broad declarations about the need for corporations to act with purpose stakeholder relationships are still viewed as a tool by which to improve financial return to shareholders. But they — the leaders of business and finance calling for stakeholder capitalism at meetings in Davos Switzerland and elsewhere — have not yet called for companies to surrender long-term shareholder value when necessary to improve the environment or the lives of workers.

Around 2010 Delaware was asked to adopt a truly alternative corporate governance model that would protect social and environmental interests along with shareholder returns. While the idea was initially treated with extreme skepticism Delaware ultimately authorized public benefit corporations (PBCs). Personally I thought the PBC’s time had come. I left my law practice to advocate for corporate governance that would allow companies to prioritize social and environmental systems.

But while debates over stakeholder capitalism and corporate purpose continued there was no change in the financial markets’ measurement of success for individual companies: cash flows and enterprise values with no regard for whether that success depended on externalized costs that would weigh down the global economy and capital market returns. In 2019 I formed TSC as a nonprofit advocate for the interests of diversified shareholders that works to help the financial system move its focus from trees to forest.

TSC seeks to catalyze the establishment of guardrails — minimum standards of conduct that ensure that the companies investors own do not externalize costs that end up being paid by other portfolio companies. Such parameters help to establish a playing field that is both level and sustainable.

The ESG Loophole: Doing Well by Doing Good but Doing Even Better by Doing Bad

ESG shareholder activism uses different tactics and covers many areas. However there is one commonality: Most ESG activism champions changes in corporate behavior that will improve impact and financial performance at the same time.

This tactic often has merit. A company may be able to improve financial performance by being more energy efficient or by treating employees well. In such instances the company can improve its social or environmental impact and its financial returns at the same time.

But it is naïve to believe that this always holds; very often the most profitable route for a company (even over the long term) is one that externalizes social and environmental costs. In a study of the global public markets asset manager Schroders found that in one year listed companies around the world earned $4.1 trillion in profits but they also created net social and environmental costs of $2.2 trillion. More than half of public company profits are subsidized by sapping critical systems that undergird the value of the economy.

This shouldn’t be surprising; our system equates company success with superior financial performance. Thus from the vantage point of a company successfully externalizing costs is a free lunch. But the lunch is not free for shareholders. They pick up the tab because they are for the most part very diversified owning shares in hundreds or even thousands of companies through index funds mutual funds and other pooled investments.

Over long time spans there is a direct correlation between GDP and portfolio value. Thus when a company externalizes a systemic cost that is borne by the economy diversified portfolios are harmed.

In the U.S. for example companies like Walmart and McDonald’s may increase their financial returns through poor pay but the prevalence of low-wage work contributes to poor health reduced educational opportunity reduced civic participation and inequality. An unhealthy undereducated and disengaged population means the nation’s economic potential will remain unfulfilled leading to portfolios as a whole performing below their potential over time.

Diversified shareholders essentially own a slice of that economy so when companies in their portfolios increase their own financial returns with conduct that damages systems they are making a bad trade on behalf of these investors. There are many more examples:

Climate. Swiss Re recently reported that failing to stick to the Paris Agreement would lower GDP by 7% to 14% by 2050. Just 100 companies are responsible for 71% of industrial global greenhouse gas emissions.

The food and beverage business bears significant responsibility for this issue.

In the lead-up to the 2008 crash financial industry players pursued profits for their own shareholders while creating risks that threatened the entire economy. Public health. The COVID-19 pandemic revealed that for-profit medical facilities had reduced their inventories of protective gear to reduce costs creating the risk that the economy would be unable to sustain itself in the event of an infectious disease crisis; pharmaceutical companies are using intellectual property rights in ways that maximize their cash flows but appear to limit global vaccine-manufacturing capacity creating greater opportunities for the evolution of dangerous variants that threaten long-term economic health.

Protecting our economy (and diversified investors) from such threats will require some companies to change their business plans and accept lower returns. Such changes will not be feasible unless the playing field is leveled as business will flow to companies that continue to externalize costs unless a critical mass is forced to end the practice.

Stock Compensation: Feeding the Conflict’s Fire

Ballooning equity compensation of recent decades has only intensified the conflict.

In 2022 the median salary of an S&P 500 CEO rose to a record $14.5 million. With salaries paid almost entirely in stock and options CEOs and other senior leaders are fixated on the financial performance of their companies.

Boards who approve these grants use vesting periods and holding requirements to ensure that management’s financial interest is aligned with long-term shareholders’ and not just short-term traders’.

But large share grants do not align executive interests with those of diversified shareholders. Instead by giving executives an outsize incentive to increase a company’s financial return equity compensation becomes gasoline on the ESG conflict fire.

A CEO with $50 million in company stock will benefit greatly from the profits that come to her company by externalizing costs. Presumably she does not have comparable wealth in other companies so the proportional personal benefit she receives from such practices will far outweigh her exposure to the systemic risks that threaten diversified shareholders.

The Uncomfortable Reality

This leads to two conclusions that might seem counterintuitive:

First the financial interests of shareholders sometimes will be best served if the companies they own reduce their own long-term financial returns. Second executive pay should encourage such reductions if they result in net benefits to the economy.

Frances Haugen captured the tension when she highlighted Facebook’s repeated decisions to favor profit over the public good. Instead of “public good” she could easily have said “What was good for the long-term value of diversified portfolios.”

Facebook’s complicity in the Myanmar genocide where the military was allowed to systematically use Facebook to foment hate and violence against the country’s minority Rohingya population provides a horrifying example of profit maximization causing human suffering but it also shows the economic devastation created by Facebook’s prioritization of profit over broad economic interest.

What Protecting Diversified Shareholders Means in Practice

It is 34 years since James Hansen then the director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies told the Senate that “the greenhouse effect has been detected and it is changing our climate now.” Despite the provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act designed to mitigate climate change carbon emissions in the U.S. and much of the rest of the world remain far off the track of scientific consensus. There are many reasons that governments around the world are unable to adequately address the externalization of the cost of carbon by businesses that find such activity profitable.

While we might prefer government-led solutions myriad existential economic threats — including growing inequality declining social cohesion tax evasion and soil loss — are not waiting on more effective regulation.

By acting at the investor level shareholders can avoid the value-maximization trap that precludes executives from making system-preserving changes. Investors can level the playing field with standards that preserve the resource-allocation function of competition while making sure the competition occurs within sustainable boundaries so profits represent true value creation rather than exploitation of scarce common goods.

Investors can take the following steps:

Establish universal guardrails. Unlike current ESG standards guardrails must be developed outside of companies so they are set with a view toward maximizing the overall value of the systems that uphold markets not the value of individual companies or industries involved in the negotiation.

Apply the guardrails through collective action at all relevant companies. To ensure that companies stay within guardrails investors can vote against directors take-private transactions and companies that want to go public but don’t commit to follow the measures. Investors can do the same in private equity venture capital and hedge funds. Other companies outside of these channels can be influenced through their supply chains.

Avoid the trap of individual company engagement. As described at the beginning of this article individual companies are not structured to address the broad systemic concerns that matter most to diversified investors. Moreover without universal guidelines to create a level playing field progress toward sustainability will be undone by nonconforming peers.

Design stock compensation that dovetails with guardrails. Equity plans should claw back shares when companies fail to adhere to guardrails.

Engage asset managers. Investors are not well served by managers that focus on matching or beating a benchmark if they are not engaging in the systemic stewardship described in this article. Mandates for managing portfolios voting shares or otherwise impacting governance must address this critical aspect of value for diversified shareholders.

It is time for a new paradigm that shifts the emphasis of investing from the performance of individual elements of diversified portfolios to the performance of the portfolio as a whole with a focus on the interdependence of all companies which are connected in the complex global web that is the modern economy.

This shift is necessary to avoid potentially catastrophic violation of numerous planetary and social boundaries. A realistic assessment of corporate decision-making today must conclude that many current business models depend upon exploiting critical social and environmental systems.

Without a change in the investment paradigm businesses will continue to drain critical social and natural resources putting not just their investors at risk but our entire global economy. Diversified shareholders have the power to push back; it is their responsibility to use it.

Meta takes down hundreds of Facebook Instagram accounts associated with Proud Boys

Executives with the social media company Meta announced Thursday that they recently removed 480 Facebook and Instagram accounts pages and groups associated with the Proud Boys for violating the platforms' ban on the far-right extremist group.

The Proud Boys organization was banned by Facebook and Instagram in 2018. Meta is the parent company of both platforms.

Since the ban Meta representatives say they have taken down 750 assets associated with the Proud Boys including accounts pages groups and events.

Many of the pages Meta recently removed represented so-called ""front groups"" that hid their affiliation with the Proud Boys according to the company. They would ""appear benign"" a Meta spokesperson told ABC News -- but they were in fact ""attempting to direct people off platform to facilitate discussion recruitment and organizing"" for the extremist group.

""The change in adversarial tactics makes it clear this group is aware that we're tracking them and enforcing against them"" the spokesperson said.

""While there's no silver bullet here our approach is impacting these dangerous organisations and we can see adversaries trying harder to hide their affiliation & change tactics"" Meta Counterterrorism Policy Lead Dina Hussein posted on Twitter. ""We'll continue to stay vigilant and share our findings.""

The social media giant used a tactic they call ""strategic network disruption"" to remove an entire network at once company officials said.

It's ""an important tool in our work to keep our platforms and communities safe -- and counter malicious groups like the Proud Boys when they attempt to abuse our platforms to cause offline harm and violence"" the spokesperson told ABC News.

The tool allows Meta to study how groups attempt to bypass the company's detection systems the spokesperson said.

Meta Vice President of Content Policy Monika Bickert told reporters Thursday that the company ""will continue to refine our targeted approach to adversarial threats as well as our scaled enforcement.""

The takedown of Proud Boys content represents just a tiny fraction of the company's recent enforcement efforts according to company officials. In the second quarter of 2022 Meta removed 2.3 million pieces of Facebook content related to organized hate and 449000 on Instagram -- the majority of which was removed before users reported it the company said.

Wall Street must think that Meta Platforms (META -0.10%) founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has lost his mind spending tens of billions of dollars on developing Reality Labs the company's business segment building for the metaverse. The FAANG stock which is supposed to be among the most dominant technology stocks on earth has fallen in value a whopping 57% from its high its most significant drawdown since going public.

But is Zuckerberg making a huge mistake here or is he crazy like a fox? Fortunately it doesn't actually matter for the company's overall performance.

Let's take a look at why the stock is a table-pounding buy with or without Reality Labs.

Social media apps can't stop won't stop

Meta continues to dominate the social media landscape. According to Sprout Social three of the world's top four most downloaded smartphone apps in the fourth quarter of 2021 were Instagram Facebook and WhatsApp all owned by Meta Platforms.

Meta's family of apps has amassed a staggering 3.65 billion monthly active users as of the second quarter of 2022. Consider that the global population is approaching 8 billion and an estimated 2.9 billion have never used the internet. That means that most technologically adept people use Meta's social media networks.

Incredibly Meta's reach continues to grow; the company's monthly active users grew 3.9% year over year in Q2. Meta currently gets most of its revenue from advertising to its user base. Still there is future growth potential in payments e-commerce and other avenues that Meta can aggressively roll out because it has a built-in customer base; it's arguably a distribution network unlike any other in the world.

Meta stock is cheaper than it looks

Meta has struggled with Apple's iOS privacy changes that can block iPhone apps from tracking user data. However share price declines have dramatically outrun the actual impact on Meta's financial performance.

Ultimately shareholders want as much of a company's cash profits as possible for their investment. Therefore you can look at a stock's free cash flow yield to see how much you're getting; more is better. In Meta's case the stock had never offered investors more than a 5% yield on free cash flow until this year; now the yield is at 8% its highest ever by a country mile:

Remember these two critical factors. First this is free cash flow -- Meta's cash profits despite its weakened advertising business. Second Meta has spent aggressively on Reality Labs jacking up its capital expenditures in recent quarters. These expenses take away from free cash flow which means the free cash flow yield would be even higher if it weren't for Reality Labs.

Meta is masking its business's profitability by spending so much on Reality Labs. The company makes about $0.33 in free cash flow from every revenue dollar which jumps to almost $0.49 if you go by cash from business operations. It's hard to find a business that big spitting out cash profits so efficiently.

What if Zuckerberg is right about the metaverse?

It can be tempting to think short-term sometimes; Wall Street sees Meta spending all this money and receiving little in return. However few people have stopped to wonder about the potential upside if Zuckerberg is right about his metaverse ambitions. Meta has outlined that Reality Labs is a multiyear investment that could take as much as a decade to bear fruit.

Meta could emerge with a technology juggernaut that it spent years and many billions to build which competitors won't easily replicate. Zuckerberg has discussed the idea that the metaverse could house a digital economy with up to a billion people interacting trading and spending within it. You can be sure that Meta would be incorporating advertising into it too a digital world that theoretically has no physical limitations.

Sure it's a bold ambition that would understandably give investors pause and it's the type of massive bet that few companies can afford. However Meta can afford it and investors are getting the stock so cheaply valued that it could be a complete zero and the stock is still cheaper than it's ever been just on its existing social media networks. It could take years to see this play out but it's hard to deny today's attractive risk-reward proposition.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3RvcGNsYXNzYWN0aW9ucy5jb20vbGF3c3VpdC1zZXR0bGVtZW50cy9wcml2YWN5LzM3LTVtLW1ldGEtc2V0dGxlbWVudC1yZXNvbHZlcy1kYXRhLXByaXZhY3ktY2xhaW1zLW92ZXItdHJhY2tpbmctdGVjaG5vbG9neS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,$37.5M Meta settlement resolves data privacy claims over tracking technology,"Top Class Actions’s website and social media posts use affiliate links.

Meta tracking technology class action settlement overview:

Who: Meta Platforms Inc. has agreed to a class action settlement with a Class of Facebook users.

Why: The settlement was made to resolve claims Meta violated the privacy of Facebook users with its location tracking technology.

Where: The class action lawsuit was filed in California federal court.

Meta Platforms Inc. has agreed to pay $37.5 million to resolve claims it violated the privacy of Facebook users with its location tracking technology.

Facebook users asked a federal judge in California on Monday to sign off on the class action settlement which calls for funds to be distributed to Class Members on a pro rata basis.

Meta was accused of violating its privacy policy by allegedly collecting storing and monetizing the location data of users who had their location services turned off on their mobile devices.

Facebook users argued Meta used thelocation data it collected in order to benefit its targeted advertising campaigns.

The Meta settlement will benefit individuals who used Facebook in the US between Jan. 30 2015 and April 18 2018 and whose location data was collected by Facebook despite their location services for the Facebook app being turned off.

Facebook users speculate settlement could have as many as 70 million claimants

The lead plaintiffs in the class action lawsuit speculated that the amount of eligible claimants could reach as many as 70 million consumers.

“Assuming a class size of approximately 70 million users the settlement amount represents 53% of what plaintiffs could have recovered under a nominal damages theory based on a judgment of $1 per class member” Facebook users said in their motion for preliminary approval.

Meta previously attempted to get the class action lawsuit dismissed at which time Facebook users amended the complaint to include a breach of contract claim reports Law360.

In 2020 a federal judge in California dismissed a pair of complaints arguing Facebook violated the law by allegedly tracking its users cellular location data without their consent.

The plaintiffs are represented by Sabita J. Soneji of Tycko & Zavareei LLP Barrett J. Vahle and Jillian R. Dent of Stueve Siegel Hanson LLP Franklin D. Azar Paul R. Wood and Michael D. Murphy of Franklin D. Azar & Associates PC and Ivy T. Ngo of Roche Freedman LLP.

But that isn’t stopping food companies from establishing their places in the metaverse.

Food brands including CPG companies quick-service restaurants and their suppliers are starting to explore what the metaverse has to offer in the way of reaching and engaging with customers. And the opportunity is much bigger – this technology currently very much in its infancy has the potential to disrupt everything from how companies market their products to how they train their workers.

What is the metaverse?

So what exactly is the metaverse? It’s a 3D virtual reality world where users interact with the environment and others via avatars.

As an easy way to think about it WIRED’s Eric Ravenscraft recommends mentally replacing “the metaverse” with “cyberspace.” “Ninety percent of the time the meaning won’t substantially change” he writes. “That’s because the term doesn’t really refer to any one specific type of technology but rather a broad (and often speculative) shift in how we interact with technology.”

Looked at this way the concept is a little easier to grasp especially if you think about the massive ways our interactions with technology have shifted over the past two decades. The metaverse is just an interactive virtual world.

Metaverse opportunities for the food industry

In a recent PwC survey 66% of executives reported that their companies are actively engaged in the metaverse and 82% said they expect metaverse plans to be part of their business activities within three years.

Those numbers sound high until you think about how many equipment manufacturers started offering virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) options for service and training during the pandemic. Over the past few years virtual plant tours digital twins of equipment and AR-assisted service calls have become common offerings. They may not have specifically been touted as part of “the metaverse” but they all fit the definition.

This trend toward the use of virtual worlds will likely continue as technologies improve and manufacturers start to realize the very tangible bottom-line benefits such as the money saved from testing a piece of equipment before it’s even built. Keith Shaw contributing editor for the Association for Advancing Automation identifies the following as the top five ways the industrial metaverse will benefit manufacturers:

Training employees more quickly more safely Simulations ahead of physical deployments can find improvements Using AR/VR for field service workers to repair equipment on the job Product design collaboration virtually around the world Building physical products from virtual designs; adding digital assets from physical items



The metaverse also offers huge potential for food brands to interact with consumers in new ways.

In PwC’s survey 36% of executives said they plan to use the metaverse to create virtual content for customers to engage with. Coca-Cola is a leader among food and beverage brands in this area.

Last month Coca-Cola celebrated its one-year anniversary in the metaverse by dropping a new digital collectible of which there are now more than 4000. People who own these digital collectibles have access to special perks like Coke Studio experiences gaming events and early access to limited-edition product launches. Earlier this year Coca-Cola launched the limited-edition Coca-Cola® Zero Sugar Byte a gaming-inspired sparkling beverage that “[brings] the flavor of pixels to life.”

Providing these kinds of experiences may be key for food brands to re-engage consumers who have become more interested in private label since pandemic-related shortages meant they couldn’t find their normal brands EY senior analyst Jon Copestake told Food Navigator.

Restaurant chains are also taking to the metaverse. McDonald’s Wendy’s and Chipotle have opened up virtual locations on Facebook’s metaverse (see Business Insider for descriptions and images) and several other restaurants including Burger King Yum Brands and Chick-Fil-A have filed trademarks to join.

How companies can prepare for the metaverse

Whether you’re a food brand looking for new ways to meet consumers or an industry supplier incorporating digital tools into your offerings the metaverse has something to offer.

As with any new investment companies need to start with a strategy. PwC provides several pieces of advice. Here’s a brief overview of a few of their recommendations:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHA6Ly93d3cuZm5ibmV3cy5jb20vVG9wLU5ld3MvaG93LXNxY2VuYWJsZWQtd2VpZ2hpbmctaW1wcm92ZXMtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1saW5lLXBlcmZvcm1hbmNlLTcwMDA00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How SQC-enabled weighing improves production line performance | FNB News,"You can get e-magazine links on WhatsApp. Click here TOP NEWS How SQC-enabled weighing improves production line performance Stathis Pothitakis



The German chocolate brand Ritter Sport exports to more than 100 countries and knows that overfills from each of its products by just a single gram increases the cost in raw material by about three tons every day.



With multiple production lines running the goal is to optimise filling so that it is neither under- or over-filling its ingredients. The manufacturer takes a twin approach to checking its product weights: automatic checkweighers inspect specialty bagged products while samples of square chocolate bars that have just been pressed out of the moulding form are taken from a belt by an operator at predefined time intervals to be manually weighed on a ICS bench scale.



Working at speed the data gathered in these processes is collected and analysed in the FreeWeigh.Net statistical quality and process control software provided with the ICS bench scale. Ritter Sport can immediately determine at the point of production whether there has been any process deviation that requires an adjustment to be made. The operator is informed of the deviation and what adjustment is required for a quick intervention.



As a major exporter Ritter Sport has to comply with multiple national and international net content guidelines and global food standards. The use of Statistical Quality Control (SQC) with FreeWeigh.Net software is a key control that supports manufacturers in meeting compliance with these guidelines and standards.



What is SQC?

Defined as a statistical way of controlling quality parameters as well as processes SQC utilises methods such as Statistical Process Control (SPC) which adopts sampling and statistics to monitor the quality of an ongoing process such as the production operation. The statistical analysis works by taking weight measurements of net content from a base number of samples and calculating the Standard Deviation – the level of variation between the sampled products.



Of course it helps if the weighing device is capable of providing weighing measurements that can be trusted. There are two key terms that define a systems performance: the accuracy and the precision. Though these may at face value seem to be the same thing there is an important distinction between the two terms. Accuracy is the ability of the device to measure a known value while precision is the ability of the device to repeat the same measurement consistently. As can be seen in the table below ideally a weighing device should be both accurate and precise. If either parameter or both is lacking then maintenance and adjustment may be required to establish consistent and meaningful measurement results.



Accuracy and Precision









Comparison

It is possible for food manufacturers to operate without statistical aids such as SQC but doing so significantly increases the possibility of human error when using static scales to check net product content. In comparison SQC enables the swift identification of any process deviation and the consequent immediate adjustment of other production line parameters (on filling machines for example) needed to bring performance back within Standard Deviation allowances.

SQC can be used with static scales (or ""non-automatic weighing instruments"") that require a product to be manually placed with time required for the weight to be calculated. It can also be used with""automatic weighing instruments"" such as automatic scales and dynamic checkweighers that are installed on the line and perform the weighing calculation as the product moves along the line.

Using weighing technology that is equipped with SQC/SPC-enabled software provides clear advantages over relying on a manual calculation of the Standard Deviation in a set of samples as this table clearly illustrates:



Optimising production yield from a defined amount of raw ingredients is important for all manufacturers but when you are creating more than three million individual products every day it becomes critical.The German chocolate brand Ritter Sport exports to more than 100 countries and knows that overfills from each of its products by just a single gram increases the cost in raw material by about three tons every day.With multiple production lines running the goal is to optimise filling so that it is neither under- or over-filling its ingredients.

Scale without SQC Scale with SQC Checkweigher with SQC Automatic or manual recording of sample weights and Standard Deviations Sample weights are recorded and Standard Deviation manually calculated.



Samples are recorded from the scale which calculates the Standard Deviation and may provide operators with action signals.

Inline checkweighers do not need human intervention and automatically weigh every single product for quality checks. Scope of statistical process Statistical process with possibility of deviation from the actual status.

Statistical process with possibility of deviation from the actual status.

Automatically records weights and calculates very accurate standard deviation and filling trends.

Speed of process Slow process - time consuming with late ""reaction"" to improve or correct the process.

Interaction with production lines is much faster compared to software scales without SQC.

No human intervention. Checkweighers can be connected with the fillers and automatically perform required corrections.

Data connectivity Archiving documentation and batch release takes longer.

Can be networked and data stored securely via a server.

Checkweigher can also be connected with Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and/or Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) and share actual production data.

Risk of human error Human error possibility very high. Human error possibility significantly lower.

No human error possibility.



It is clear from this table that whether a company is using a scale or a checkweigher implementing SQC makes for faster and more accurate calculation of Standard Deviation.This delivers a more immediate identification of potential over- and under-filling issues and consequent adjustment of production line equipment to reduce waste.



Benefits

There are benefits for food manufacturers across many levels of the business. Fundamentally it provides better control over the quality of products they manufacture. Any unwanted trends towards under- or over-filling can be quickly rectified saving wasted production. This benefit extends substantially into the realms of legal compliance where SQC is a recognised tool for proving compliance to legislation such as European requirements for e-marking (net weight control) and weights and measures authorities. It delivers similar compliance benefits relating to regulations for Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) or Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) in pharmaceutical manufacturing as laid down by the US Food and Drug Administration.



Manufacturers are required by law not to under-fill to provide products that are safe for the consumer and to keep detailed records around the areas of production quality and quantity that can be quickly made available for audit.



The commercial requirements of a food manufacturer’s customers may not have the same legal standing but are critical nonetheless. Those customers can be reassured about the quality of the safety processes used in producing the product as well as the ability of the manufacturer to demonstrate legally-tight documentation and transparency around their processes due to using SQC. If needed the data generated in complying with higher legal requirements can also be used to prove to the customer that quality processes/standards have been adhered to.



The Financial and Environmental Protection Argument

The financial benefits of reduced waste and greater efficiency in production are another convincing argument for using SQC-enabled product weighing equipment whether industrial scales or checkweighing. Over time the money saved by reducing unnecessary overfill can help to pay for the investment in quality assurance systems. At the same time accurate and precise use of raw materials means less waste for a positive impact on the environmental footprint of the production process.



Nor are there great costs involved for manufacturers in equipping themselves with SQC or indeed utilising the capability they may already have in their existing weighing equipment software. Scales and checkweighers should be calibrated routinely and calibration records made available for inspection. Routine maintenance on the machines must be upheld to ensure data accuracy and operators trained to understand the importance of SQC data and the process adjustments that might be required because of it.



It is recognised that dynamic checkweighers represent a relatively high initial investment albeit one that delivers a fast return to allow high product throughput speeds with a highly reliable quality check that significantly reduces the risk of an entire batch loss. With these substantial initial costs in mind an alternative approach is permitted by legislators in which filling quantity checks can be carried out on random product samples of suitable size on an approved static scale. The advantage is the lower initial investment especially since one checkweigher cannot usually be used for multiple filling lines. However in the case of random sample checks the operator is obliged to remove the entire batch if the random sample result does not comply with legal requirements. From a financial perspective it is therefore a matter of assessing the initial high investment costs of a checkweigher performing advanced inspection capabilities against the possible ongoing loss of entire batches during random inspections.



Production sites with multiple production lines operating at different speeds might opt for a combination of SQC static scales and dynamic checkweighers with all data collected in a central database and FreeWeigh.netsoftware monitoring overall compliance. With FreeWeigh.Net factories have the option to use standard scales networked to collect weigh data from multiple lines and quality check locations with data consolidated in one report and used for releasing the batch.



Summary

Manufacturers can decide what best suits their needs to measure filling weights in production. Whether implementing standalone scales checkweighers or combinations of the two the use of SQC and FreeWeigh.net software improves their ability to identify and rectify filling issues at an early stage.



This is an important quality process that has an impact on production line efficiency manufacturing costs regulatory compliance and environmental performance and as such the benefits of SQC-enabled weighing should be of interest to all food manufacturers.

According to a Thursday report from Inside Asian Gaming this prediction was made by the President and Chief Executive Officer for the American casino giant’s MGM Resorts Japan subsidiary Ed Bowers (pictured) during a Wednesday conference being held in Singapore. The experienced executive purportedly also forecast that the envisioned enterprise will eventually generate aggregated annual tax revenues of around $1.5 billion and serve as an important economic driver for the surrounding Kansai region and the entire nation.

Prominent property:

New York-listed MGM Resorts International is reportedly looking to take advantage of federal legislation ratified in the summer of 2018 so as to bring a Las Vegas-style casino resort to a 121-acre portion of Osaka’s man-made Yumeshima Island. The source disclosed that this Japanese venue is set to be developed in partnership with local financial services giant Orix Corporation and eventually come complete with multiple hotels a selection of bars and restaurants exhibition and conference facilities and a large gaming floor operated under the terms of a 40-year license.

Favorable factors:

Moreover the Global Development President for MGM Resorts International Bowers reportedly told Inside Asian Gaming that annual aggregated revenues from his company’s envisioned integrated casino resort in Japan would probably be higher than any other gambling-friendly venue in Asia due to ‘the Kansai region’s population base of around 25 million’ its proximity to a trio of major airports and the presence of a high-speed rail network providing easy access to a number of large metropolitan areas including Tokyo. The figure purportedly went on to pronounce that the project is to ‘be the most expensive integrated resort ever built in Asia’ and will likely employ approximately 15000 people once completed.

Bowers reportedly proclaimed…

“Between casino tax and entry fee payments we expect the project to contribute around $777 million annually to the city and Osaka Prefecture. An equal amount will also be contributed to Japan’s national government.”

Tentative timeline:

MGM Resorts International is reportedly still waiting for the green light to begin work on its planned Osaka facility after submitting its finished proposal to a panel of federal selectors in advance of an April 28 deadline. Bowers purportedly furthermore declared that his firm is hoping to receive a final decision sometime next month and is ‘currently focused on the preparation of schematic design drawings and on the completion of geological surveys of the site.’

Bowers reportedly stated…

“After we receive approval from the central government we will move into detailed design work with a view to commencing site work by mid-2023. If approved we are hopeful to complete construction and open the integrated resort by the end of 2029.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3czNsdi5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9zdHJpcHN0ZWFrLWF0LW1hbmRhbGF5LWJheS10by1jbG9zZS1mb3ItcmVub3ZhdGlvbnMtdGhpcy1mYWxs0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzM2x2LmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9zdHJpcHN0ZWFrLWF0LW1hbmRhbGF5LWJheS10by1jbG9zZS1mb3ItcmVub3ZhdGlvbnMtdGhpcy1mYWxs?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,STRIPSTEAK at Mandalay Bay to close for renovations this fall,"One Las Vegas Strip restaurant will be closed for the remaining to undergo some remodeling.

Providing insights into MGM’s plans for an IR in Osaka should it be granted a concession by the central government later this year during a keynote speech the G2E Asia Special Edition: Singapore conference on Wednesday Bowers said he expects the property to provide a major financial boost for the Kansai region and the nation as a whole.

“This will be the most expensive IR ever built in Asia” he said. “The project will employ around 15000 people.

“Between casino tax and entry fee payments we expect the project to contribute around JPY106 billion annually to the city and the prefecture of Osaka which depending on the prevailing exchange rate will equate to between US$800 million and US$900 million (currently US$773 million).

“An equal amount will also be contributed to Japan’s national government.”

Bowers said revenues at MGM’s Osaka IR would “exceed those of most other IRs in Asia based on the Kansai region’s population base of around 25 million proximity to three major airports and connection via high-speed rail to other major metropolitan centers around Japan specifically Tokyo.

Although the company has yet to be given the green light for its IR proposal Bowers expressed confidence in what MGM has put forward with a final decision expected as early as next month.

Providing an update on the process he said “We are currently focused on the preparation of schematic design drawings and on the completion of geological surveys of the site.

Ruth Brown. Little Richard. Jimi Hendrix. These artists and many other Black pioneers of music and film set the tone for the generations that followed. Yet when we look at Black artistry across eras and how it fits contextually into history it’s rarely overstated and often overlooked.

Years ago memorabilia collector Ralph DeLuca set out to preserve a slice of Black performance history from the 1920s through the 1970s. The pinnacle of that work is Caldonia an exhibit at the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art featuring 44 vintage posters chronicling the concerts and films of some of the greatest Black talents of the 20th century.

“It’s an amazing collection that Ralph DeLuca amassed over 20 years and this is only a portion of it” says Demecina Beehn curator of special projects and programs for MGM Resorts Art & Culture. “Much of it is actually extremely rare where there may only be three copies in existence. Some of these posters have never been seen before. It’s this part of history that is starting to disappear.”

Caldonia a reference to a 1945 love song performed by saxophonist Louis Jordan and written by Black songwriter Fleecie Moore (whose writing would later inspire artists such as Queen and James Brown to incorporate iconic shouts in their music) debuted at Salon 94 in New York City earlier this year. DeLuca went through great lengths to build the collection tracking down old printers of concert posters promoters and even their families.

The exhibit features rarities such as the first mention of rock ’n’ roll in promotional material one of the only cinematic presentations of Bessie Smith (in the 1929 short film St. Louis Blues) and a glance at the poster for The Emperor Jones a 1933 film featuring actor Paul Robeson that was privately funded and historically the first to depict a Black man killing a white man on screen.

The work itself is resplendent. In some cases artists’ faces and words appear as cutouts planted stylishly along the poster with bold splashes of color while declarations of “the greatest colored cast ever assembled” leap out above the images. It’s surreal to see phrases like that in 2022 as are the concert posters with Stevie Wonder Marvin Gaye and Martha and the Vandellas all listed on the same bill for a $2 ticket.

Caldonia’s brief introduction to the “Chitlin’ Circuit” a series of nightclubs juke joints and theaters that commercially supported touring Black performers during segregation also revealed how many artists such as Aretha Franklin Big Mama Thornton Lester Young and James Brown were able to get their starts and make names for themselves. The circuit’s influence on so many legendary musicians goes widely unnoticed today but has been thoughtfully revived by DeLuca’s efforts.

It’s eye-opening to see just how much history is in danger of fading away. But more than 100 performers receive recognition in Caldonia which is what they’ve always deserved.

“You have comedians you have musicians you have big bands you have actors and actresses. Everything’s coming together to showcase this boom of talent even in the midst of segregation in the midst of the deep oppression of African Americans” Beehn says. “I really want people to take away the contribution of Black creative talent to American society and the weight of that.”

In collaboration with CSEM 3Brain AG has announced an exciting 3D microchip for their brain-on-chip portfolio. This first-in-class cell-electronic interface technology will allow scientists to study the complexity of 3D cellular networks at unrivaled scale and precision – and to gain novel mechanistic insights into the inner workings of the most complex structure in the universe the human brain.



Understanding how organs form and how their cells behave is essential to finding the causes and treatment for developmental disorders as well as understanding certain diseases. However studying most organs in live animals or humans is technically difficult expensive and invasive.



New biotechnologies like human-derived stem cells offer to recapitulate the complexity and functionality of human tissues and allow for the generation of novel and exciting test systems including multicellular models three-dimensional cultures and organ-on-a-chip. But the increasing complexity of these model systems brings new challenges for researchers and companies. Novel methods and devices are needed to meet accuracy precision sensitivity specificity and repeatability requirements for the evaluation of physiologically relevant endpoints in these systems.



Electroactive tissues like the heart brain or nervous system are built up from networks of cells that communicate with each other via rapid depolarization of their membrane potential mediated by the opening and closing of voltage-gated ion channels. Cellelectronic interfaces are devices that record or instigate dynamic changes in extracellular field potential close to the plasma membrane corresponding to the flux of ions into or out of cells and connect these biosignals to computers in real-time. 3Brain's technology can connect to thousands of cells at the same time and process biosignals at 20.000 frames per second in a spatially resolved pixel array not unlike an ultra-high-speed HD camera thereby effectively expanding the concept of label-free functional imaging beyond optical approaches.



Currently cell-electronic interfaces like patch clamp and more recently high-density multi-electrode arrays are limited to 2D and suffer many limitations when it comes to measuring 3D model systems like brain organoids or tissue preparation because they cannot reach the necessary proximity to

physiologically relevant cells.



To tackle these challenges 3Brain AG paired up with CSEM a Swiss research and technology organization with expertise in precision manufacturing to develop a 3D cell-electronic interface based on complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. This first-in-class 3D CMOS microchip (named Accura-3D) is equipped with sensory gold-electrodes mounted on thousands of biopolymer-covered microneedles. Accura-3D enables the investigation of 3D cellular networks at unprecedented depths and resolution which will open up unrivaled access to the complexities of biological systems. With only half the diameter of human hair biopolymer-covered microneedles bypass damaged and surface cell layers of 3D model systems without disrupting the overall cytoarchitecture thus retaining full biological integrity. Furthermore custom-made microfluidic

channels at the basis of Accura-3D were designed to mitigate physiological impact of varied diffusion gradients for oxygen nutrients and compounds a common issue when 3D models are measured with in vitro devices built for 2D.



With the addition of Accura-3D to their brain-on-chip portfolio 3Brain AG has announced that the 3D chip design will be fully compatible and integrated with their existing technology platforms.





""What we really want is to empower researchers to ask new and daring biological questions that have so far been impossible to investigate"" says Mauro Gandolfo CEO and co-founder of 3Brain AG. ""Our cellelectronic interfaces expand the concept of optics-free functional imaging all without the need for biological markers fluorescent proteins or genetic manipulation of cellular networks. With Accura-3D we created a first-in-class solution that can directly access the complex cytoarchitecture of 3D tissues and brain organoids. The biggest challenges are taking the vast amounts of data coming from cells and processing them without losing critical information in real-time. Accura-3D does a lot of the heavy lifting with on-chip processing signal amplification and noise filtering which basically makes the chip itself intelligent. This integrated intelligence is a remarkable distinction from other instruments in the preclinical space and helps researchers to record or even actively stimulate biosignals at unprecedented depths. There is just no comparable solution out there.""



3Brain AG has been working on advanced microchip technology applied to life science for more than 15 years. Alessandro Maccione CSO and co-founder of 3Brain AG says ""We are very attentive to the opportunities offered by advanced cell models such as spheroids and organoids. We already have results showing that Accura-3D is vastly superior in measuring physiologically relevant cells and

biosignals. We started focusing on brain organoids because of their relevance to model devastating developmental and neurodegenerative diseases of the brain that pose a high burden for our society for example Alzheimer's and epilepsy. Scientifically Accura-3D is super exciting because it will allow us to peek deeper into the inner workings of tissues and organoids and ask questions previously out of reach. Why where and how does spontaneous activity emerge in brain organoids and how do coordinated brain waves start? Does neuronal activity shape cytoarchitecture or is it the other way round? How does connectivity evolve over time? Are there differences in neuronal development in organoids derived from healthy versus at-risk patients? The possibilities are almost endless Accura-3D is opening the door into the galaxy of our own minds and this is what I think many scientists will want to explore with us. For many a three-dimensional cell-electronic interface that can collect cellular information directly from the inside of tissues and organoids might sound like science fiction. We

made it a science fact.""





For the development of Accura-3D 3Brain has partnered with CSEM to push the boundaries of what is possible with 3D microfabrication. Michele Palmieri VP Micro and Nanosystems at CSEM was ecstatic about what they achieved ""Together with 3Brain AG our team has been developing cutting-edge microfabrication processes to create a dense vertically developed microneedle array on top of preprocessed advanced CMOS wafer. Such tall vertically bound array goes above and beyond the stateof-the-art for microelectrode arrays with an extreme electrode vertical/horizontal aspect ratio in excess of 8. To build it it takes more than 80 process units including photolithography and etch multi-metal stack deposition noble metal electroplating structural polymeric material planarization etc. … to put it simply it’s a microtechnology masterpiece – a technologist’s and neurobiologist’s ultimate dream.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vaW50ZXJlc3RpbmdlbmdpbmVlcmluZy5jb20vaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi8zZC1icmFpbi1jaGlwLWRldGVjdC1tZW50YWwtaWxsbmVzc2Vz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Swiss company's newly developed chip provides imaging much easier,"A 3D microchip made by a Swiss company will allow scientists to study the complexity of 3D cellular networks.

The Idaho-based company is looking at a site near Lockhart in Caldwell County to build the facility according to its applications for tax breaks filed with the state comptroller's office. The applications describe the project as an eight-phase semiconductor manufacturing facility.

Micron's investment would total at least $20 billion through 2030 but possibly much more over the following decade the documents indicate.

The precise amount is unclear from Micron's applications for tax breaks from the Lockhart school district under the state's Chapter 313 incentive program. The company has filed eight separate applications with the Lockhart Independent School District for various phases of the project stretching out until 2043. The school district has not given final approval to the applications.

If the property tax breaks are approved for the initial phase and Micron goes through with its plans the taxpayer-funded incentives would total about $565 million over 10 years according to an American-Statesman analysis assuming no change in the district's tax rate over that time.

More:Samsung's Austin-area expansion would need millions of gallons of water. Where would that come from?

Micron makes computer memory and data storage chips and is one of the world’s largest semiconductor companies. Its products are primarily used in automobiles computers servers consumer electronics smartphones and communications products.

A number of other high-profile global tech giants also are considering big investments in the Austin area and have applied for tax breaks under Chapter 313 including Samsung NXP and Applied Materials. Samsung which already is building a $17 billion chip factory in Taylor has said it is evaluating the region for 11 more plants that could become operational on a staggered basis from 2034 to 2042.

The state's Chapter 313 incentive program which has been controversial is set to expire at the end of this year — but agreements approved before the program expires will be allowed to proceed. That has prompted a rush of applications from companies racing to get in under the wire. A total of 408 applications for Chapter 313 tax breaks have been filed this year according to the comptroller's office compared with a previous full-year high of about 150.

Micron said earlier this month that it plans to invest $40 billion through the end of the decade to build leading-edge memory manufacturing facilities in multiple phases in the U.S. In total the investment would create up to 40000 jobs in the U.S. including 5000 highly paid technical and operational roles the company said. Globally Micron has 11 manufacturing sites and employs 45000 people.

Micron has reportedly been considering a number of locations for its newest plant including Boise Idaho where it is headquartered.

In the Lockhart application the company said potential tax breaks would be a “determining factor” in the location it chooses for its new facility.

“Texas’s notoriously high property tax is often a burden on developers; thus in the absence of a Chapter 313 value limitation agreement the economic rate of return on this project would be greater in locations outside the state of Texas. Considering the large footprint of Micron their ability to locate this project in an area where an economic incentive agreement can be secured is high” the company said.

'An incredible development run'

Semiconductor companies already make up about a quarter of all Central Texas manufacturing output according to the Austin Regional Manufacturers Association but Micron could bring a significant addition.

Ed Latson CEO of the manufacturers association said the addition of Micron would be a cap on ""an incredible development run” for the region that includes investment from other manufacturers including Samsung.

“If we win this deal we will be the premier signature cluster in the United States. We would have the most diverse sector with having a foundry business having a logic business with Micron and then also having the semiconductor equipment industry with Applied Materials and Tokyo Electron” Latson said. “I think we would have the most dynamic and strong business community in that electronic space.”

Thom Singer CEO of the Austin Technology Council said the proposed project would help the region's technology sector continue to grow and thrive.

“Austin is clearly a major center for the semiconductor business and there is a lot of opportunities for the growth of good paying high-tech jobs and the other positive economic factors that come with these projects” Singer said. “While not every proposed project will happen it is in the best interest of our area that we are being considered and companies are applying to build their projects here.""

Latson said Austin’s existing status as a semiconductor manufacturing hub makes it an attractive place for other semiconductor companies.

“The ecosystem here is set up to really support these companies and growing and providing them with what they needed to make the best product” Latson said. “We have the advanced workforce; we have the suppliers. We have a good centralized location so that they can get their products to customers a variety of locations and Texas is a pro-business friendly state that's going to allow them to operate without too much regulation. All those things align into being a really great place to invest.”

The proposed facility could bring a new major employer to Lockhart which has a population of about 14000. The town which is considered by some to be the barbecue capital of Texas is about 30 miles south of Austin.

Latson said the Micron plant would be transformational for Lockhart and that location would still keep the plant within range of the Central Texas ecosystem.

“This is another incredible once-in-a-lifetime investment that can be made in the region and policymakers and the community needs to be aggressive with making sure that we win this deal” Latson said. “The jobs and the revenue for the community will help address our challenges and affordability.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50ZWNodGltZXMuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzI3OTYyNS8yMDIyMDgyNC9hbWF6b24tY2FyZS1zaHV0cy1kb3duLXRlbGVoZWFsdGgtY292ZXJhZ2UtbG9uZ2VyLWF2YWlsYWJsZSVFMiU4MCU5NHdoYXQtaGFwcGVuZWQuaHRt0gGMAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2h0aW1lcy5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGVzLzI3OTYyNS8yMDIyMDgyNC9hbWF6b24tY2FyZS1zaHV0cy1kb3duLXRlbGVoZWFsdGgtY292ZXJhZ2UtbG9uZ2VyLWF2YWlsYWJsZSVFMiU4MCU5NHdoYXQtaGFwcGVuZWQuaHRt?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3D Brain Chip Detects Mental Illness to Study Complex Structures As Well,"Scientists have developed a new microchip focusing on analyzing complex structures and different systems including the human brain that claims to detect mental illness among patients.

A picture of a human brain taken by a positron emission tomography scanner also called PET scan is seen on a screen on January 9 2019 at the Regional and University Hospital Center of Brest (CRHU - Centre Hospitalier Régional et Universitaire de Brest) western France. - The CHRU of Brest has just acquired a new molecular imaging device.

Labiotech reported that there is a new 3D microchip from a Swiss company called 3Brain AG and the Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology (CSEM) that claims its focus on complex structures. The developers said it aims to understand how the organ works and their cells behave which became the key for the developer's technology.

The main focus of the 3D microchip is on giving researchers and scientists a new device that will also help them analyze 3D cellular networks focusing on its complexity. According to Interesting Engineering 3Brain AG is a company that works on providing next-level therapeutics for treating brain disorders and the CSEM focuses on deep tech development.

Together these two companies presented a new device to help in understanding more of the grey matter.

Creators Claim 3D Brain Chip can Detect Mental Illness

The creators claim that this 3D microchip will also help in detecting mental illness in patients and researchers may apply it to modern devices that allow for its diagnosis. It can see mental conditions like Alzheimer's disease and the like.

It centers on the technology which uses sensory gold-electrodes mounted on biopolymer-covered microneedles. The chip can process thousands of bio-signals at a significant rate of 20000 frames per second.

Brain Chips and Its Development

Brain implants bring a massive development to the world's progression and its application for humans to help in their needs especially those who developed illnesses that affect their overall function. One technology aims to help those that suffer from paralyzation to spell out what he wants as the patient cannot talk or write about it with due to their condition.

The brain is still the most vital power there is available to humans and harnessing it for better use is one of the best ways to maximize function in the entire body. A team in Australia found ways to harness brain power and use it for different applications to create simulations that would help improve its use and function soon translating into helpful ways for people.

A new microchip for multiple purposes aims to understand more of complex structures and not all are necessarily implants as with the case of 3Brain AG and CSEM's creation. This new 3D microchip will bring developments for different fields and applications helping the world with many problems to solve including mental illness and health.

The company filed with the City of Boise to build the new office building complete with an auditorium sky bridge amenities and workspace seating for 2167 employees.

“The proposed building is to be a world-class state-of-the-art building for the Micron Boise campus

both externally and internally” the company wrote in its design review application to the City of Boise.

The plan calls for a 7-story building which the company dubs B42 with a sky bridge connecting it to an adjacent office building on the second floor. The first floor would include an auditorium and amenities. Workspace would start on the second floor and continue through the seventh floor.

The building would also include a “pedestrian promenade on the east outdoor dining and lounge areas and an amphitheater.”

The new Micron building at 524000 square feet would be one of the city’s largest office buildings. For comparison the 18-story Zions Bank Building is 320000 square feet. The nine-story headquarters for the JR Simplot company is a total of 306345 square feet. And the 19-story US Bank Building downtown is 256568 square feet.

Evolving campus

The company has spent hundreds of millions on the campus in recent years according to previous BoiseDev reporting. It has remodeled several buildings and built another large office building in the last decade.

Though Micron has a 25-acre campus some of its workers are located offsite. The company houses workers in a building it calls Micron North about a mile north of the main campus. Property records show the facility is owned by the JR Simplot Co. which used to operate its food group division out of the building.

As BoiseDev has reported the company has considered Boise for a large expansion of semiconductor manufacturing supported by federal tax dollars. The company has said it will spend up to $40 billion on new manufacturing capacity of semiconductor chips in the US. The company has not confirmed Boise is a candidate for the manufacturing expansion but also has refused to say the city is not in the running.

The proposed new B42 office building is unrelated to the potential manufacturing expansion. It would need design review approval from the City of Boise.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rdnVlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL21vbmV5L2Vjb25vbXkvYm9vbXRvd24tMjA0MC9taWNyb24tdGVjaG5vbG9neS1sb2NraGFydC1jYWxkd2VsbC1jb3VudHktbmV3LWNoaXAtZmFjaWxpdHkvMjY5LTg2NjhmZjdlLTg3ZmEtNDA0ZC1hZDMxLWEyNTM2Yzk2YWU3YtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Micron Technology considering Lockhart for new chip facility,"According to documents filed with the state comptroller's office Micron's investment would total at least $20 billion through 2030.

LOCKHART Texas — The booming semiconductor industry in Central Texas may be getting bigger.

Micron Technology is looking at a site in Caldwell County near Lockhart to build a multi-billion dollar facility. The company makes computer memory and data storage chips.

According to documents filed with the state comptroller's office Micron's investment would total at least $20 billion through 2030.

According to a report by KVUE's news partners at the Austin American-Statesman an exact number on the investment was not clear from applications for tax breaks under Chapter 313 through the Lockhart school district. That's the same application Samsung NXP and Applied Materials are using to build their facilities.

The report states that the Idaho-based company filed eight separate applications with various phases of the project that stretch out through 2043.

Analysis by the Statesman indicates that if the tax breaks are approved the taxpayer-funded incentives would total about $565 million over 10 years. That's assuming the school district doesn't change its tax rate over that period of time.

Read the full report by the Austin American-Statesman here.

Ed Latson the CEO of the Austin Regional Manufacturers Association said the semiconductor industry is booming especially in Central Texas.

""What a win for Lockhart. If this deal comes through you know it's going to infuse a lot of money into their school district. It's going to give you know a huge boost to the local business community and I think you'll see a mega transformation all over the eastern crescent of Central Texas"" Latson said. ""They'd be a great contributor to the economy to the ecosystem that already exists here.""

The superintendent at Lockhart ISD Mark Estrada released the following statement:

""Lockhart ISD is honored to be considered for this opportunity. We genuinely feel that our innovative and excellent schools as well as our growing community would be a great fit for the leading-edge vision of Micron should they choose to locate in Lockhart. We hope to learn of Micron's decision by the end of the year.""

According to the comptroller's office as of June 30 Texas has more than 600 Chapter 313 agreements in place. There has been a spike in applications this year because the program ends in December.

If the deal goes through Latson said an investment of this size would change Lockhart's trajectory for years to come.

""This would be a generational investment. You don't get these opportunities very often and this is an unprecedented time"" Latson said.

NOBELIUM remains highly active executing multiple campaigns in parallel targeting government organizations non-governmental organizations (NGOs) intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) and think tanks across the US Europe and Central Asia. The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) assesses that MagicWeb was likely deployed during an ongoing compromise and was leveraged by NOBELIUM possibly to maintain access during strategic remediation steps that could preempt eviction.

NOBELIUM has used abuse of identities and credentialed access as a method for maintaining persistence and a specialized capability like MagicWeb is not novel for the actor: in September 2021 Microsoft disclosed a post-exploitation capability named FoggyWeb with methods and intent similar to MagicWeb. FoggyWeb was capable of exfiltrating the configuration database of compromised AD FS servers decrypting token-signing certificates and token-decryption certificates and downloading and executing additional malware components. MagicWeb goes beyond the collection capabilities of FoggyWeb by facilitating covert access directly. MagicWeb is a malicious DLL that allows manipulation of the claims passed in tokens generated by an Active Directory Federated Services (AD FS) server. It manipulates the user authentication certificates used for authentication not the signing certificates used in attacks like Golden SAML.

NOBELIUM was able to deploy MagicWeb by first gaining access to highly privileged credentials and moving laterally to gain administrative privileges to an AD FS system. This is not a supply chain attack. The attacker had admin access to the AD FS system and replaced a legitimate DLL with their own malicious DLL causing malware to be loaded by AD FS instead of the legitimate binary. The backdoor was discovered by Microsoft’s Detection and Response Team (DART) in coordination with MSTIC and Microsoft 365 Defender Research during an ongoing incident response investigation. Microsoft is sharing this information with consent from the client. At the time of this investigation MagicWeb appears to be highly targeted.

Like domain controllers AD FS servers can authenticate users and should therefore be treated with the same high level of security. Customers can defend against MagicWeb and other backdoors by implementing a holistic security strategy including the AD FS hardening guidance. In the case of this specific discovery MagicWeb is one step of a much larger intrusion chain that presents unique detection and prevention scenarios.

With all critical infrastructure such as AD FS it is important to ensure attackers do not gain administrative access. Once attackers gain administrative access they have many options for further system compromise activity obfuscation and persistence. We recommend that any such infrastructure is isolated accessible only by dedicated admin accounts and regularly monitored for any changes. Other security measures that can prevent this and other attacks include credential hygiene to prevent lateral movement. AD FS is an on-premises server and as with all on-premises servers deployments can get out of date and/or go unpatched and they can be impacted by local environment compromises and lateral movement. For these reasons migration to a cloud-based identity solution such as Azure Active Directory for federated authentication is recommended for the robust security it provides. See the mitigation section below for more information. Though we assess the capability to be in limited use Microsoft anticipates that other actors could adopt similar methodologies and therefore recommends customers review hardening and mitigation guidance provided in this blog.

How MagicWeb subverts authentication

MagicWeb is a post-compromise malware that can only be deployed by a threat actor after gaining highly privileged access to an environment and moving laterally to an AD FS server. To achieve their goal of maintaining persistent access to an environment by validating authentication for any user account on the AD FS server NOBELIUM created a backdoored DLL by copying the legitimate Microsoft.IdentityServer.Diagnostics.dll file used in AD FS operations. The legitimate version of this file is catalog signed by Microsoft and is normally loaded by the AD FS server at startup to provide debugging capabilities. NOBELIUM’s backdoored version of the file is unsigned. The threat actor’s highly privileged access that allowed them to access the AD FS server meant they could have performed any number of actions in the environment but they specifically chose to target an AD FS server to facilitate their goals of persistence and information theft during their operations.

After gaining administrative access to an AD FS server via elevation of privilege and lateral movement the loading of NOBELIUM’s malicious Microsoft.IdentityServer.Diagnostics.dll into the AD FS process is possible by editing C:\Windows\AD FS\Microsoft.IdentityServer.Servicehost.exe.config to specify a different public token which controls what loads into the AD FS process when it is started. Because AD FS is a .NET application it loads the DLLs specified in the config file from the Global Assembly Cache (GAC). By changing the token in the configuration the adversary directed AD FS to load in the malicious DLL. The interception and manipulation of claims by MagicWeb enables the actor to generate tokens that allow the adversary to bypass AD FS policies (role policies device policies and network policies) and sign in as any user with any claims including multifactor authentication (MFA).

Figure 1. C:\Windows\AD FS\Microsoft.IdentityServer.Servicehost.exe.config being set to load Microsoft.IdentityServer.Diagnostics.dll

Figure 2. NOBELIUM uses a different public token than the legitimate Microsoft.IdentityServer.Diagnostics.dll telling AD FS to look for a different file in the GAC

Figure 3. Close up from Microsoft.IdentityServer.Servicehost.exe.config showing MagicWeb’s malicious PublicKeyToken compared to the PublicKeyToken of the legitimate version of the DLL

Figure 4. The directories in the GAC on a server infected with MagicWeb; the malicious Microsoft.IdentityServer.Diagnostics.dll file and the legitimate one are located in different directories

To understand how NOBELIUM can subvert the AD FS process with the MagicWeb malware it’s important to understand how AD FS claims work. AD FS extends the ability to use single sign-on functionality available within a single security or enterprise boundary to internet-facing applications to provide customers partners and suppliers a streamlined user experience while accessing an organization’s web-based applications. AD FS relies on claims-based authentication to validate the identity of the user and their authorization claims. These claims are packaged into a token that can be used for authentication. MagicWeb injects itself into the claims process to perform malicious actions outside the normal roles of an AD FS server.

Figure 5. How the AD FS claims pipeline issues a token for a user entering a federated application

Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) uses x509 certificates to establish trust relationships between identity providers and services and to sign and decrypt tokens. These x509 certificates contain enhanced key usage (EKU) values that specify what applications the certificate should be used for. For instance an EKU containing an Object Identifier (OID) value of 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2.2 would allow for the use of a SmartCard logon. Organizations can create custom OIDs to further narrow certificate usage.

MagicWeb’s authentication bypass comes from passing a non-standard Enhanced Key Usage OID that is hardcoded in the MagicWeb malware during an authentication request for a specified User Principal Name. When this unique hard coded OID value is encountered MagicWeb will cause the authentication request to bypass all standard AD FS processes (including checks for MFA) and validate the user’s claims. MagicWeb is manipulating the user authentication certificates used in SAML sign-ins not the signing certificates for a SAML claim used in attacks like Golden SAML.

Figure 6. Example of a user certificate accepted by MagicWeb; the highlighted numbers under “Unknown Key Usage” is one of two OIDs hardcoded into MagicWeb

Figure 7. Example of a user certificate chain which shows an invalid digital signature but still works for authentication

NOBELIUM uses unique tradecraft per target so it’s highly likely that the OIDs and public tokens are unique per target as well. We’ve redacted these OIDs and tokens in this report. Please see the hunting guidance section for information on how to look for variants related to this attack.

How to mitigate this threat

NOBELIUM’s ability to deploy MagicWeb hinged on having access to highly privileged credentials that had administrative access to the AD FS servers giving them the ability to perform whatever malicious activities they wanted to on the systems they had access to.

It’s critical to treat your AD FS servers as a Tier 0 asset protecting them with the same protections you would apply to a domain controller or other critical security infrastructure. AD FS servers provide authentication to configured relying parties so an attacker who gains administrative access to an AD FS server can achieve total control of authentication to configured relying parties (include Azure AD tenants configured to use the AD FS server). Practicing credential hygiene is critical for protecting and preventing the exposure of highly privileged administrator accounts. This especially applies on more easily compromised systems like workstations with controls like logon restrictions and preventing lateral movement to these systems with controls like the Windows Firewall.

Migration to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication is recommended to reduce the risk of on-premises compromises moving laterally to your authentication servers. Customers can use the following references on migration:

Advanced hunting queries

Recommended hunting guidance

Have Inventory Certificate Issuance policies in your Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) environment including all EKU attributes used in the environment and compare to known OID values.

Hunt across Windows Event Logs by enabling AD FS verbose logging . Enable security auditing to allow collection of the AD FS event logs  and specifically look for Event ID 501 . This event specifies all the EKU attributes on a claim. Hunt across these logs to look for EKU values which your PKI infrastructure isn’t configured to issue.

verbose logging security auditing AD FS event logs Look for portable executable files in the GAC or AD FS directories on your systems that aren’t signed by Microsoft and inspect these files or submit them for analysis.

Perform an audit of your exclusion settings to be sure that the AD FS and GAC are included in scans. Many organizations exclude the AD FS directories from security software scanning because of performance degradation concerns.

Microsoft Sentinel

Microsoft Sentinel customers who have enabled verbose mode logging for ADFS can use this query to look for suspicious OIDs: https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Detections/SecurityEvent/ADFSAbnormalEnhancedKeyUsageAttribute-OID.yaml.

NOTE: It’s important to enable the proper connector in Sentinel with the correct Event collection. Refer to this post for more details on AD FS Audit logging collection in Sentinel.

Searching for unsigned files in the GAC

The legitimate Microsoft.IdentityServer.Diagnostics.dll is catalog signed by Microsoft. Catalog signing is a method Windows uses for validating code integrity different from Authenticode and is used for offline validation rather than runtime enforcement of running only signed code. The catalog signing on this file means the file may appear to be unsigned on the file properties pane and in file integrity checkers security tools and online malware repositories. The scripts below allow you to look for unsigned binaries and understand both catalog-signed binaries and Authenticode-signed binaries.

Surface unsigned DLLs in GAC using Microsoft 365 Defender

This query surfaces unsigned DLLs in the GAC folder created within the last 60 days.

DeviceImageLoadEvents | where FolderPath has @""C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\assembly\GAC_MSIL\Microsoft.IdentityServer."" and FileName endswith "".dll"" and not(isempty(SHA1)) | join kind = leftanti (DeviceFileCertificateInfo) on SHA1 | distinct DeviceName FolderPath FileName SHA1 SHA256

Enumerate non-Microsoft signed DLLs in the GAC using PowerShell

Below is an example script that could be used to enumerate non-Microsoft signed DLLs in the relevant GAC folder where servers.txt is a list of servers you wish to scan. Because the legitimate Microsoft.IdentityServer.Diagnostics.dll is catalog signed signing won’t appear when viewing file properties but it will show in PowerShell querying and on load of the DLL.

$servers = get-content -Path (path to file)\servers.txt Foreach ($server in $servers) { Write-Output ""Processing server: $server"" Invoke-Command -ComputerName $server {Get-ChildItem -Filter ""*.dll"" -Recurse ""C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\assembly\GAC_MSIL\"" | get-authenticodesignature | ft} }

Detections

Microsoft Defender Antivirus

Microsoft Defender Antivirus provides detection for this threat under the following malware name:

Trojan:MSIL/MagicWeb.A!dha

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint customers may see the following alert as an indication of possible attack:

ADFS persistent backdoor detected

Indicators of compromise (IOCs)

Microsoft isn’t sharing IOCs on this NOBELIUM activity at this time. However NOBELIUM frequently customizes infrastructure and capabilities per campaign minimizing operational risk should their campaign specific attributes be discovered. If MagicWeb is identified in your environment it’s unlikely to match any static IOCs from other targets such as a SHA-256 value. It’s recommended to use the hunting guidance provided above to investigate your environment.

Technical analysis of MagicWeb

NOBELIUM has modified the legitimate Microsoft.IdentityServer.Diagnostics.dll by adding malicious code to the TraceLog class from the Microsoft.IdentityServer.Diagnostics namespace/type.

The header section of the TraceLog class from the legitimate Microsoft.IdentityServer.Diagnostics.dll is shown below:

Figure 8. The header section of the TraceLog class of Microsoft.IdentityServer.Diagnostics namespace/type from the legitimate Microsoft.IdentityServer.Diagnostics.dll

Meanwhile the header section of the TraceLog class from NOBELIUM’s backdooredversion of Microsoft.IdentityServer.Diagnostics.dll is shown below:

Figure 9. The header section of the TraceLog class of Microsoft.IdentityServer.Diagnostics namespace from NOBELIUM’s backdoored version of Microsoft.IdentityServer.Diagnostics.dll

In the backdoored version of the code as shown above NOBELIUM has added a static constructor for the TraceLog class. A static constructor is used to initialize any static data or to perform a particular action that needs to be performed only once. It’s called automatically before the first instance is created or any static members are referenced.

The malicious static constructor gets executed once before the first instance of the TraceLog class is created. Given that new instances of the TraceLog class is created in various locations in this DLL the execution of the malicious static constructor is guaranteed to occur as soon as the DLL is loaded for the first time (which would be upon startup of the AD FS server after the malicious changes to Microsoft.IdentityServer.Servicehost.exe.config described above).

NOBELIUM’s malicious static constructor contains a reference to the Initialize() method from a class named AuthLog.

Figure 10. Reference to the Initialize() method from a class named AuthLog in the malicious static constructor

The AuthLog class is a brand-new and malicious class that’s been added to the DLL by NOBELIUM.

Figure 11. The Initialize() method of the AuthLog class

As shown above the Initialize() method references a class named RuntimeHelper yet another class added to the DLL by the actor. The primary purpose of the RuntimeHelper class and its OverloadMethod() method is to hook legitimate AD FS related methods at runtime. By hooking the legitimate AD FS methods the backdoor is capable of intercepting calls to the legitimate methods to instead invoke its own custom methods.

The screenshot above shows the following legitimate AD FS methods being hooked by MagicWeb:

Target assembly/DLL Target type Target method to hook Malicious hook method (actor introduced) Microsoft.IdentityServer.IdentityModel.dll Microsoft.IdentityModel.X509CertificateChain Build BeginBuild Microsoft.IdentityServer.WebHost.dll Microsoft.IdentityServer.WebHost.WrappedHttpListenerRequest GetClientCertificate BeginGetClientCertificate Microsoft.IdentityServer.WebHost.dll Microsoft.IdentityServer.WebHost.Proxy.ProxyConfigurationData EndpointConfiguration BeginEndpointConfiguration Microsoft.IdentityServer.Service.dll Microsoft.IdentityServer.Service.IssuancePipeline.PolicyEngine ProcessClaims BeginProcessClaims

Hook method: BeginBuild()

MagicWeb’s BeginBuild() method is used to hook the legitimate target method Build() (from Microsoft.IdentityServer.IdentityModel.dll).

Figure 12. MagicWeb’s BeginBuild() method

The BeginBuild() method first calls the MagicWeb’s helper method ValidateX509Extensions().

If the helper method ValidateX509Extensions() returns true BeginBuild() returns true.

If ValidateX509Extensions() returns false or an exception is thrown by calling ValidateX509Extensions() BeginBuild() invokes and returns the value returned by the legitimate Build() method from Microsoft.IdentityServer.IdentityModel.dll.

This means that before the legitimate target method Build() from the legitimate Microsoft.IdentityServer.IdentityModel.dll gets an opportunity to inspect/build a certificate MagicWeb’s hook method first inspects the certificate and returns true if the helper method ValidateX509Extensions() returns true.

This allows the attacker to subvert the normal certificate inspection/build process by introducing a custom certificate inspection/build method that’s invoked before the legitimate Build() method is invoked.

MagicWeb’s helper method ValidateX509Extensions() is called by BeginBuild() and other methods.

Figure 13. Helper method ValidateX509Extensions()

ValidateX509Extensions() returns false if the X509 certificate passed to the method is null or the Microsoft Cryptographic API certificate context handle/pointer isn’t set.

Next the method enumerates the extensions in the X509 certificate passed to the method. If an enumerated extension is of type X509EnhancedKeyUsageExtension the method iterates the OIDs of the extension calculating the MD5 hash of each OID (using a custom hash computation helper method ComputeHash() that leverages the .NET MD5 class).

If the MD5 hash value of the OID matches one of the two following hardcoded MD5 values the method returns true (this methodology is used to check if one of the two OID values below are present in the extension):

67F5BD28A842A1C9[REDACTED] (MD5 hash value corresponding to the OID value 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.21.8.868518.12957973.4869258.12250419.[REDACTED].[REDACTED].[REDACTED].[REDACTED])

6E3466296D2F63D[REDACTED] (MD5 hash value corresponding to the OID value 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.21.8.868518.12957973.4869258.12250419.[REDACTED].[REDACTED].[REDACTED].[REDACTED])

If none of the OID values are present the method returns false.

This helper method returns true if the certificate passed to the method contains one of the two magic OID values listed above.

Hook method: BeginGetClientCertificate()

Figure 14. MagicWeb’s BeginGetClientCertificate() method used to hook the legitimate target method GetClientCertificate() (from Microsoft.IdentityServer.WebHost.dll)

To retrieve the client’s X509 certificate this method first calls the legitimate GetClientCertificate() method from Microsoft.IdentityServer.WebHost.dll. Next the hook method calls the helper method ValidateX509Extensions() to determine whether the client certificate contains one of the two “magic” OID values. If the client certificate contains one of the two OID values the hook method:

Obtains the _adapter field from the current object

Obtains the _request field from the _adapter object

Sets the value of the m_ClientCertificateError field (from the _request object) to 0

This means that regardless of what the legitimate method GetClientCertificate() (from Microsoft.IdentityServer.WebHost.dll) sets the m_ClientCertificateError field to if a client certificate contains one of the magic OID values the hook method overwrites or sets the m_ClientCertificateError field to 0.

By using this technique the hook method appears to be influencing the normal behavior of the application to treat or accept a non-valid client certificate as a valid certificate.

Hook method: BeginProcessClaims()

Figure 15. The BeginProcessClaims() method of MagicWeb used to hook the legitimate target method ProcessClaims() (from Microsoft.IdentityServer.Service.dll)

The hook method first indirectly invokes the legitimate ProcessClaims() method by invoking the ProcessClaims() method of the AuthLog class.

On line 198 in figure 16 the hook method calls MagicWeb’s helper method GetClaims() passing in the processed identity object returned by invoking the legitimate ProcessClaims() method.

Figure 16. The GetClaims() helper method

As shown above the GetClaims() method accepts an identity object as a parameter. The method then initializes three variables named type type2 and type3 with values obtained from the RuntimeHelper’s static field/array named types:

Figure 17. The three variables initialized with values

The types field contains the following values:

Figure 18. Values in the types field

The assemblyByName2 variable above contains an assembly object representing the legitimate assembly Microsoft.IdentityServer.IdentityModel.dll (if not already loaded the RuntimeHelper class loads the assembly into the current application domain). By calling the GetType() method RunHelper initializes the member of the types field/array with .NET types from the Microsoft.IdentityServer.IdentityModel.dll assembly.

Returning to the GetClaims() method and the initialization of type type2 and type3 the variables type type2 and type3 get initialized with the following type objects from Microsoft.IdentityServer.IdentityModel.dll:

type: Microsoft.IdentityModel.Claims.IClaimsIdentity type object

type2: Microsoft.IdentityModel.Claims.ClaimCollection type object

type3: Microsoft.IdentityModel.Claims.Claim type object

Next the GetClaims() method retrieves the Claims property of the Microsoft.IdentityModel.Claims.IclaimsIdentity identity object. It also retrieves the number of claims (of type Microsoft.IdentityModel.Claims.ClaimCollection) present in the Claims property:

Figure 19. GetClaims() retrieving the Claims property

GetClaims() then enumerates the claims (of type Microsoft.IdentityModel.Claims.Claim) retrieving the string containing each claim and the corresponding claim type:

Figure 20. GetClaims() enumerating the claims retrieving the strings and storing in list

As shown above the claim string and claim type string are then stored in a list named list. This list of claims and their corresponding claim types is then returned to the caller of the GetClaims() method BeginProcessClaims().

Returning to the BeginProcessClaims() method after retrieving the claims using the GetClaims() method the hook method BeginProcessClaims() searches the claims list for presence of a claim with claim type of http://schemas.microsoft.com/claims/authnmethodsreferences:

Figure 21. BeginProcessClaims() searching the claims list for a specific claim

As shown on line 198 above the claim(s) of type http://schemas.microsoft.com/claims/authnmethodsreferences (if any) is stored in a list named list. If claim of type http://schemas.microsoft.com/claims/authnmethodsreferences is present and its value is set to http://schemas.microsoft.com/claims/multipleauthn the hook method returns the IclaimsIdentity object returned by the legitimate target method ProcessClaims() (from Microsoft.IdentityServer.Service.dll) on line 191 of the hook method.

This behavior ensures that if MFA is already satisfied then the hook method simply acts as a pass-through method and doesn’t affect the normal behavior of the claim processing pipeline.

If a claim of type http://schemas.microsoft.com/claims/authnmethodsreferences is not present or its value is not set to http://schemas.microsoft.com/claims/multipleauthn the hook method proceeds to perform additional checks on the unprocessed claims (that is the claims contained in the unprocessed identity object identity passed to the hook method). Once again the hook method obtains a list of claims by calling the GetClaims() helper method. As mentioned above instead of calling the GetClaims() helper method with the processed identity object returned by invoking the legitimate ProcessClaims() method (stored in the result variable on line 191) the hook method calls the GetClaims() helper method with the unprocessed identity object identity passed to the hook method:

Figure 22. The hook method calling GetClaims()

On line 204 the hook method enumerates the value of each claim and uses the ComputeHash() helper method to calculate the MD5 hash value of each claim value (from the unprocessed identity object). It then checks if the MD5 value of any of the claims equals the MD5 hash value 6E3466296D2F63DE[REDACTED]. This hash value is the only element of a hardcoded hash list named oidMFAHashes (that is this list can be expanded to include other hash values of interest):

Figure 23. Hardcoded hash list containing the MD5 hash value of a magic OID valuea

If none of the claims have a value with MD5 hash value of 6E3466296D2F63DE[REDACTED] on line 206 the method simply returns the processed identity object returned by the legitimate target method ProcessClaims() (from Microsoft.IdentityServer.Service.dll) on line 191 of the hook method. As previously discussed the hash value 6E3466296D2F63DE[REDACTED] corresponds to the OID value 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.21.8.868518.12957973.4869258.12250419.[REDACTED].[REDACTED].[REDACTED].[REDACTED].

Hence the hook method enumerates the claims and if a claim with value 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.21.8.868518.12957973.4869258.12250419.[REDACTED].[REDACTED].[REDACTED].[REDACTED] isn’t present on the claim list the hook method simply acts as a pass-through method and doesn’t affect the normal behavior of claim processing pipeline.

If by this point in the execution cycle the hook method hasn’t returned yet it means one of the claims contains the OID value 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.21.8.868518.12957973.4869258.12250419.[REDACTED].[REDACTED].[REDACTED].[REDACTED] (otherwise according to the logic described in the paragraph above the hook method would’ve returned).

Proceeding with confirmation that one of the claims contains the OID value 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.21.8.868518.12957973.4869258.12250419.[REDACTED].[REDACTED].[REDACTED].[REDACTED] the hook method proceeds to the section that represents the main purpose of MagicWeb to perform claim injection.

Figure 24. Main section of the code responsible for the claim injection process

Before describing the code responsible for the claim injection process it’s important to revisit what’s already stored in the list and claims variables:

list: As mentioned before the hook method invokes the legitimate method ProcessClaims() to process the incoming identity object. The processed identity object (stored in result on line 191) is then passed to the GetClaims() helper method to obtain a list of claim type/value pairs extracted from the processed identity object (line 198). After obtaining the claim type/value pairs the claim(s) of type http://schemas.microsoft.com/claims/authnmethodsreferences (if any) are stored in a list named list (line 198).

Figure 25. The list variable

claims: As mentioned above this variable is used to store a list of claim type/value pairs extracted from the unprocessed identity object:

Figure 26. The claims variable

With this information in mind (and the fact that one of the claims contains the OID value 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.21.8.868518.12957973.4869258.12250419.[REDACTED].[REDACTED].[REDACTED].[REDACTED]) once again here’s the first part of the claim injection code:

Figure 27. Part of the claim injection code

As shown above if list is empty (that is the processed identity object contained no claim type/value pairs of type http://schemas.microsoft.com/claims/authnmethodsreferences) the hook method instead turns to claims (containing the list of all claim type/value pairs extracted from the unprocessed identity object) and searches for claim type/value pairs of type http://schemas.microsoft.com/claims/authnmethodsreferences in the claims list. If the claims list contains one or more claim type/value pairs of type http://schemas.microsoft.com/claims/authnmethodsreferences the hook method uses the claim information to add an identical claim of type http://schemas.microsoft.com/claims/authnmethodsreferences to the processed identity object (line 213 above).

Using this method if after passing the identity object to the legitimate ProcessClaims() method no claim of type http://schemas.microsoft.com/claims/authnmethodsreferences is returned by the legitimate method the hook method manually adds a fraudulent claim of type http://schemas.microsoft.com/claims/authnmethodsreferences to the list of claims returned to the caller of the hooked legitimate method ProcessClaims().

As shown above to add the fraudulent claim to the list of claims the hook method calls a helper method named AddClaim().

Figure 28. The helper method

Like the code in the helper method GetClaims() AddClaims() initializes two variables with the following type objects:

type: Microsoft.IdentityModel.Claims.IClaimsIdentity type object

type2: Microsoft.IdentityModel.Claims.ClaimCollection type object

On line 235 AddClaims() gets the constructor for type Microsoft.IdentityModel.Claims.Claim and invokes the constructor (passing in the claim type and value from the caller of AddClaim()) to instantiate a new Claim object.

Figure 29. The legitimate internal constructor from Microsoft.IdentityModel.Claims.Claim

The legitimate internal constructor from Microsoft.IdentityModel.Claims.Claim retrieved and invoked by AddClaim() invokes the internal constructor Claim (overloaded method) with the following method parameters:

Figure 30. The internal constructor Claim

After instantiating a new Claim object AddClaim() uses the Add() method from type Microsoft.IdentityModel.Claims.ClaimCollection to add the new claim to the identity object passed to AddClaim() by its caller (in this case the new claim is added to the identity object containing the list of claims returned by the call to the legitimate method ProcessClaims()).

Figure 31. The legitimate method Add() from type Microsoft.IdentityModel.Claims.ClaimCollection invoked by AddClaim() (line 245)

Revisiting the claim injection code in the hook method BeginProcessClaims() (and recalling the fact that one of the claims contains the OID value 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.21.8.868518.12957973.4869258.12250419.[REDACTED].[REDACTED].[REDACTED].[REDACTED]) here’s the second part of the claim injection code:

Figure 32. Second part of the claim injection code

Recall that list contains claim type/value pairs of type http://schemas.microsoft.com/claims/authnmethodsreferences extracted from the processed identity object. If none of the claims in list have the value http://schemas.microsoft.com/claims/multipleauthn the hook method proceeds to call AddClaim() to add a fraudulent claim of type http://schemas.microsoft.com/claims/authnmethodsreferences and value http://schemas.microsoft.com/claims/multipleauthn to the list of claims returned to the caller of the hooked legitimate method ProcessClaims().

Using the fraudulent claim injection techniques described above if a claim with the Magic OID value 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.21.8.868518.12957973.4869258.12250419.[REDACTED].[REDACTED].[REDACTED].[REDACTED] is presented to AD FS regardless of how the legitimate hooked method ProcessClaims() handles the claim the BeginProcessClaims() hook function ensures that a claim with value http://schemas.microsoft.com/claims/multipleauthn is returned to the caller of the legitimate hooked method ProcessClaims().

Hook method: BeginEndpointConfiguration()

The backdoor BeginEndpointConfiguration() method used to hook the legitimate target method EndpointConfiguration() (from Microsoft.IdentityServer.WebHost.dll) is shown below:

Figure 33. BeginEndpointConfiguration() method

The enumType variable is initialized with RuntimeHelper.types[0] which is a Microsoft.IdentityServer.WebHost.Proxy.CertificateValidation type object. The PropertyInfo variables propertyInfo propertyInfo2 and propertyInfo3 are initialized with property objects retrieved from ‘properties’ field/array of RuntimeHelper:

propertyInfo: CertificateValidation property from type Microsoft.IdentityServer.WebHost.Proxy.ProxyEndpoint of Microsoft.IdentityServer.WebHost.dll

propertyInfo2: Path property from type Microsoft.IdentityServer.WebHost.Proxy.ProxyEndpoint of Microsoft.IdentityServer.WebHost.dll

propertyInfo3: Endpoints property from type Microsoft.IdentityServer.WebHost.Proxy.ProxyEndpointConfiguration of Microsoft.IdentityServer.WebHost.dll

Next the hook method retrieves the value of the Endpoint property of the value object that the legitimate EndpointConfiguration() method was called with. The Endpoint property holds a collection of ProxyEndpoint objects. The hook method enumerates the ProxyEndpoint objects and for each object it checks if the value of the CertificateValidation enum is set to ‘1’ which signifies ‘SSL’. If the CertificateValidation enum for a ProxyEndpoint object is set to ‘1’/’SSL’ on line 165 the hook method overwrites the value of the CertificateValidation enum with ‘0’ which signifies ‘None’. To ensure the change is reflected the hook method then overwrites the Endpoint property of the value object with the updated Endpoint property containing the overwritten CertificateValidation enum values (that is ‘SSL’ overwritten with ‘None’).

Behaving as a true hook method on line 179 the method calls the legitimate EndpointConfiguration() method but with the modified ‘value’ object. Hence when the legitimate EndpointConfiguration() method is invoked during the normal operation of AD FS this hook method intercepts the call and before passing the object to the legitimate EndpointConfiguration() method was invoked with it overwrites the CertificateValidation value of each ProxyEndpoint object and only then it calls the legitimate EndpointConfiguration() method but now with modified CertificateValidation value(s) changed from ‘SSL’ to ‘None’.

The purpose of overwriting CertificationValidation value to ‘None’ (wherever it’s ‘SSL’) is to allow WAP to pass the request with the specific malicious certificate to AD FS for further authentication processing. According to Microsoft.IdentityServer.ProxyService/TLSClientReqeustHandler WAP stops sending the current request from client to AD FS if CertificateValidation is ‘1’ (‘SSL’) and the client certificate has an error during validation.

Figma

Microsoft and Adobe have been friendly bedfellows for decades. Microsoft's dominant PC operating system has been the gateway for Adobe to reach millions of business users with its design software. The companies' CEOs even attended the same high school in India and both moved to the U.S. in the 1980s for graduate school in computer science. They share a common bond over the successful transition from desktop software to the cloud. But inside Microsoft an emerging challenge to Adobe is catching fire and raising questions about the future of one of the tech industry's most intimate relationships. Figma a San Francisco-based startup that celebrated its 10th anniversary in August is being used by tens of thousands of employees inside Microsoft and for many is at the heart of their daily work. The number of users has steadily increased in recent years though neither company will say how many of them are editors with paid accounts. The cloud-based design software came in the door in 2016 when Microsoft acquired mobile app development platform Xamarin and brought in a 350-person team that months after the deal closed would become Figma power users. The product has since become so central to how Microsoft's designers do their jobs that Jon Friedman corporate vice president of design and research said Figma is ""like air and water for us."" It's also used by engineers marketers and data scientists across Microsoft. ""Figma's become I would say sort of the No. 1 common tool we use to collaborate across all of the design community in the community and beyond"" said Friedman who's worked at Microsoft for over 18 years. It's ""really great at helping us collaborate at scale and at global scale. I can collaborate with teams we have in India China Europe Israel and Africa."" Venture investors have been all in on the growth. In June 2021 during the heyday of mega financings Figma was valued at $10 billion in a funding round that included participation from Morgan Stanley's Counterpoint Global. That was before the 2022 market plunge sent many cloud stocks down by more than half and largely halted pre-IPO rounds. Figma hasn't announced plans for a stock market debut and shareholders aren't pressing for one anytime soon in large part because the market for new offerings has dried up this year. The company backed by the likes of Index Ventures Greylock Partners and Kleiner Perkins now has the size and growth trajectory to land solidly on the radar of public investors. Annualized recurring revenue has more than doubled in consecutive years and is poised to top $400 million in 2022 according to people with knowledge of the company's financials who asked not to be named because the numbers are confidential. Figma's workforce has swelled to 800. While Microsoft has served as a growth driver for Figma spending millions a year on its deployment the company's software has also taken off at Google  Oracle and Salesforce  where it started small and grew organically as fans touted it to their colleagues. Other customers include Airbnb  Dropbox  Herman Miller Stripe and Twitter . After Figma founder and CEO Dylan Field tweeted earlier this month about the company turning 10 years old he received flattering responses from Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor and Atlassian co-CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes. Taylor started his response with ""I [heart emoji] Figma."" For Figma getting traction inside big companies particularly within Microsoft has required going head-to-head with Adobe's competing XD program and winning its fair share of deals. That doesn't mean the market has completely flipped or that Adobe is being fully supplanted. ""We're still heavy on Adobe Illustrator Photoshop and XD"" Friedman said. Adobe and Microsoft have worked together for more than two decades. In addition to Adobe gaining ubiquity by distributing across Windows machines the two companies have been syncing their products in desktop cloud and mobile computing with over 50 integrations listed on Microsoft's website. Penetrating that alliance has not always been smooth for Figma. In 2016 Microsoft acquired Sunrise a startup with a popular calendar app. The Sunrise team relied on Figma and continued to use it after the deal closed. Sunrise co-founder Jeremy Le Van said his employees were among the lucky ones at Microsoft. He said some Microsoft staffers weren't able to use Figma because of the business relationship with Adobe and were stuck using products such as Photoshop and XD. Despite executive resistance in certain departments some designers snuck out of the Adobe ecosystem to use Figma anyway said Le Van who stayed on as a design director at Microsoft until 2018. Friedman said he wasn't aware of examples of Figma being shut out. ""We have a great relationship with Adobe as well and love their products for many use cases at Microsoft"" he said. The same year of the Sunrise deal Adobe said it would make Microsoft's Azure its preferred cloud for Creative Cloud as well as the Marketing Cloud and Document Cloud. To mark the occasion Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen who both went to high school at India's Hyderabad Public School appeared at Microsoft's Ignite conference for IT professionals under a banner declaring that Adobe loves Azure.

'We both wanted it'

Figma's collaborative capabilities are central to its popularity. Multiple editors of a document can see one another working in real time and non-editors can view designs and leave comments. Companies pay for Figma based on the number of editors they have for their files. ""Any designer product manager or engineer can jump in and see the design system at play in any particular product"" Friedman said. Last week Figma released a version of its service that people can use in Microsoft's Teams communication app removing the need to open a browser tab. ""We both wanted it"" said Field who started Figma after scoring a Thiel Fellowship which came with a $100000 grant from venture investor Peter Thiel on the condition that he drop out of college (Brown University) and pursue a new project. The Teams integration is a tool that benefits any user of Microsoft products not just employees. Adobe which offers Teams apps for Acrobat and Creative Cloud knows all about the power of tying into the Microsoft ecosystem. It's been a big part of the company's success in its 40-year run up to almost $17 billion in annual revenue. Figma had to start small. Like many organizations Microsoft began using it for free. Today a customer can pay Figma each month based on the number of people who make changes to files while a more limited version of the service is available at no cost. In 2017 a year after the Xamarin acquisition Field hosted Friedman at his company's San Francisco headquarters. Field says he remembers asking Friedman why Microsoft didn't want to keep using the free version of Figma. ""'Look we're all worried you're going to die as a company"" Field recalled Friedman telling him. ""We can't spread it inside Microsoft as a company even though we like it because you're not charging."" It wasn't just about keeping Figma alive. As a big-spending customer Microsoft was in position to start asking for more features.

Field said Microsoft's feedback led to several improvements. For example Figma engineers worked to make it easier to move from screen to screen in a single Figma file. The company also added support for input from Xbox game controllers and made prototype previews work faster on mobile devices. Ultimately Microsoft's requests helped Figma develop its top-tier enterprise plan Field said adding to the free version and paid monthly premium packages that range from $12 to $45 per editor per month. The enterprise package runs at $75 per editor and includes dedicated account managers and advanced password management. Václav Vančura remembers when things were very different. Vančura was a senior designer at Xamarin whose software helped companies build Android and iOS apps with Microsoft's C# programming language. When Figma announced its launch in late 2015 Vančura was impressed with the company's idea for shared design component libraries. He signed up for a preview release and received access in the summer of 2016. He encouraged his colleagues to jump on board starting with David Siegel Xamarin's head of design. Vančura and Siegel encountered snags while sharing files from design competitor Sketch. After one Xamarin employee uploaded a file to a Dropbox folder their teammates sometimes struggled to get it running on their computers either because they didn't have the right fonts installed or because they had different versions of the software. Unlike Sketch which was only available on MacOS Figma was on the browser. That meant fewer sharing issues. You grant others access by copying a link or entering their email addresses just like in Google Docs. But performance was a problem. Vančura made complex designs in Figma causing the software to slow down freeze and crash. The Xamarin workers sent Vančura's files to Figma engineers who made Figma speedier and more stable. In 2017 Vančura flew from the Czech Republic where he lives to Seattle and then made the short trek to Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond. He took the opportunity to show Figma to his team many of whom were accustomed to working in Photoshop and Illustrator. ""It was amazing. It was like watching Formula 1"" Vančura said. ""There were so many mouse pointers on the screen and everybody designed something even if it meant they were pasting GIFs or drawing rectangles. All of them were so blown away. I think that was the moment these people figured out this was a huge time saver.""

Gaining traction

Siegel who had become Microsoft's head of design for developer services wanted to get the word out more broadly that Microsoft was evolving and wasn't stuck to its old isolated ways. In 2018 he posted a manifesto of sorts online. ""We use PCs Macs Figma Sketch GitHub JavaScript ZEIT and other modern tools to design prototype and build the future of software development"" Siegel wrote on Xamarin's website. There was a link to a Figma file that Microsoft employees could open. The website reached the front page of Hacker News a discussion board for software developers. ""This is some incredible self-awareness"" one commenter wrote. Soon after Benedikt Lehnert a Microsoft product design director told Friedman that the company needed everyone on the same program whether it was Figma or XD. Microsoft chose Figma Lehnert said.

Vančura said that at Microsoft ""Figma spread across the company so fast that I don't think Adobe was even able to catch up."" Figma isn't shy about going up against an industry heavyweight. On its website Figma says ""Don’t sync to the cloud with Adobe XD. Work in the cloud with Figma."" It asserts that designers are moving away from Adobe's Creative Cloud bundle the product that accounts for 59% of Adobe's revenue. in 2020 Adobe added Figma to the list of competitors it publishes in its annual report. Analysts have raised questions about Figma to Adobe executives on at least three occasions this year. Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research asked during a January fireside chat with Adobe executives Scott Belsky and David Wadhwani if Figma was taking market share. Belsky Adobe's product chief and executive vice president for Creative Cloud didn't answer the question directly. But he acknowledged that venture capitalists have been funneling money into the space. ""It is exciting that VCs see the same thing we're seeing"" Belsky said. ""Five-plus years ago you didn't see any material dollars going into the creative tools. I think now everyone sees that."" Belsky said Adobe can take advantage of an opportunity to bring Creative Cloud to the web which it's done for Illustrator and Photoshop but not XD a product that was launched in preview in 2016. An Adobe spokesperson declined to talk about plans for a web version of XD and said the company will talk about plans for Creative Cloud at its Max conference in October. ""We do not see an impact to the Photoshop business resulting from players in the product design category"" the spokesperson said. ""We developed and have evolved Adobe XD to address the needs of our core design customers who are designing marketing experiences for screens rather than the distinct category of product design and development.""

Many challenges

Still the pressure on Adobe is intensifying. In the past three months Figma's app for iOS devices has consistently ranked above Adobe XD in the graphics and design section of Apple's App Store according to figures from Data.ai formerly known as App Annie. Wells Fargo analyst Michael Turrin said Figma has potential to expand. ""What Figma is trying to create is more of a broader platform that could become more of a system of record within this market and that's why I think this could become more important"" he said. Figma isn't the only upstart in the space making waves. An open-source alternative called Penpot which can automatically generate the underlying source code for designs people make in the software is also gaining momentum. Microsoft employees are using Penpot and have contributed to it said Pablo Ruiz-Muzquiz who co-founded the project. Of the people who test Penpot almost 20% are coming from Figma he said. Penpot's code lives on GitHub which Microsoft owns under an open-source license allowing people to download the code modify it and run it on their own servers. That's not true of Figma which keeps its own source code private. But Figma is evolving. One job description suggests Figma is considering a significant update to its iPad app that would provide a space to make new designs and not just view or share them. And Figma has been busy expanding its executive ranks. In June the company promoted Praveer Melwani its head of business operations and finance to the finance chief position. The next month former Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs executive Kate DeLeo joined Figma as vice president of investor relations and business operations. As the company marches toward an eventual introduction to Wall Street getting more out of its relationship with Microsoft presents an opportunity for growth. Expanding the number of ways Figma gets used is one avenue. ""It works great as a presentation tool"" Friedman said. Figma probably won't ever replace Microsoft's homegrown PowerPoint software or Adobe's PDF format but Field said his product boasts distinct advantages. For one Figma avoids the problem of the non-stop back-and-forth emailing of a presentation by letting people simply share a link. A Microsoft spokesperson said PowerPoint users can also use links to send documents. ""I'd be surprised if there's no salespeople at Microsoft that use it. My guess is there's some"" Field said regarding Figma. ""Is it significant? No probably not."" Not yet anyway.

And Kubernetes is key,"Credit: Microsoft

Microsoft still has not completed its 10-year-plus goal of moving all of its Microsoft 365 services to run on Azure. But a company-produced case study published earlier this month provided a glimpse into how Microsoft is going about this task.



I've been keeping tabs for years on Microsoft's work to get Office 365/Microsoft 365 hosted on Azure. In early 2021 Microsoft officials told me that ""most"" of the Microsoft 365 services including Teams SharePoint Online and Office Online -- as well as Xbox Live services -- were hosted ""primarily"" (but not entirely) on Azure. Mailbox storage for Exchange Online and Outlook.com were ""in the process of moving to standard Azure infrastructure"" they added.



I asked a week ago for an update on this project and was told the statement above was still current. Some key pieces of Exchange and SharePoint still seem to be running on the Autopilot bare-metal systems in Microsoft datacenters.



Microsoft officials have declined to speak publicly about the company's ""CloudOptimal"" work. The CloudOptimal team at Microsoft has been working inside the company to move Microsoft's own services whether home-grown or purchased as parts of acquisitions (such as Minecraft PlayFab and LinkedIn) to Azure.



On August 10 however Microsoft (rather surprisingly given the company's reticence to discuss this topic) published a case study about its effort to bring Microsoft 365 to Azure.

The case study says that Microsoft is using Windows containers running on the company's Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to accomplish at least some of this work. Microsoft's goals in moving more of its own services to Azure include better resiliency scalability automation security cost reduction and alignment of code bases. Moving from a proprietary bare-metal underlying infrastructure to a Kubernetes-based one also may help the company with hiring and retaining talent the case study says.



The case study quotes Marc Power a Microsoft Partner Software Architect tin its Experiences + Devices unit as saying the company will ""see substantial business savings -- not just from packing applications together in AKS clusters or using containers instead of VMs but by creating one platform for all our application developers.""



When Office 365/Microsoft 365 developers make changes to their code they can use Azure Pipelines or Docker to package their services as a container and push the image to Azure Container Registry. The containers are deployed to test clusters on AKS. Microsoft is using internal deployment rings to validate gradually new features and releases before rolling them out more broadly.



The case study notes that moving Microsoft 365 to Azure is a ""multiyear effort that's still underway.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhdGFjZW50ZXJrbm93bGVkZ2UuY29tL21pY3Jvc29mdC9kYXRhLWNlbnRlci1oYXJkd2FyZS1yZWZyZXNoLWN1dGJhY2stbWljcm9zb2Z0LXdoYXQtcy1uZXh00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Data Center Hardware Refresh Cutback by Microsoft — What's Next?,"Microsoft will extend the life span of its server and network equipment assets in its cloud infrastructure from four to six years CFO Amy Hood announced in the company’s FY 2022 Q4 earnings call.

According to Hood investments in software increased efficiencies in server and network equipment operations and technological advancements enabled Microsoft to add another two years to the useful life of its servers. As a result the company estimates $1.1 billion in savings during the first quarter of FY 2023 and a total of $3.7 billion for the entire fiscal year.

Microsoft follows in the footsteps of Google and Amazon who recently announced life span extensions to their cloud servers. Amazon said its servers will have a useful life of five years while its networking equipment will have six years. Similarly Google revealed that in 2021 it adjusted the useful life of its servers from three to four years and some of its networking equipment from three to five years leading to a $2 billion increase in net income and a $2.6 billion reduction in depreciation expenses.

Useful life of data center hardware on the rise

Increasing the useful life of servers is becoming the norm not only for cloud service providers (cloud SPs) but also for data center operators. Omdia’s annual surveys of North American enterprises show an upward trend in the average number of years a server is used with the 2022 results noting that a server’s useful life at enterprises is now 5.4 years.

So what’s behind this rise? It’s a combination of factors according to Vladimir Galabov head of cloud and data center research practice at Omdia. “The COVID-19 pandemic impacted companies’ revenue streams and resulted in a significant pull-back in enterprise IT spending. Enterprises either delayed server refresh or opted to migrate workloads to the cloud to reduce capex and boost their bottom line” he wrote in the survey report. Additionally “strong end-user demand amidst a global semiconductor shortage compelled cloud SPs to revisit operational practices.”

The useful life of servers may continue to go up exceeding five years. “We see an appetite for using servers for six and even seven years at the enterprise if servicing and support can be arranged” Galabov wrote. “We believe that most end users will not use servers for longer than seven years.”

How extending server life will affect data centers

For data centers prolonging the life of servers could cut down on complexity. “As a former hyperscale operator I know firsthand the intense operational impact that hardware lift and shift has and always dreaded the added complexity” said Sean Farney executive director of data center strategy and innovation at JLL. “Change is the enemy of availability so avoiding the complexity of refresh is welcome.”

In terms of security Farney does not envision any downside to using servers for longer. “In order for life span extension to increase exposure there would have to be a new and unaddressed vulnerability in old server chipset or hardware revealed which is less common than many software-based vectors” he said.

Extending server life could also lower costs. “Data centers will find out that sweating their system assets [for] a couple of extra years will literally be no sweat at least in terms of hardware durability” said Corey Donovan president of Alta Technologies an enterprise IT hardware distributor. He recommends focusing on component upgrades to fill the years-long gap on hardware refreshes while also enabling clients’ extension plans.

“SMB server managers when faced with the high costs to rip and replace a server rack often turn to component upgrades to buy another two to three extra years of capability” Donovan said. “When combined with ongoing software optimization and OS tuning a processor and memory upgrade across all systems goes a long way without blowing up capital expenditures.”

Aside from component upgrades Galabov wrote that “dynamic workload allocation new data management and backup practices will further reduce the criticality of each server. It will act as a booster of the useful life of servers in the long run.”

It’s not just costs that could be saved but also the time and effort spent on frequent refreshes. “The planning staffing and mindful execution of the methods and procedures are painstaking and considerable. Thousands of hours of labor are saved here” Farney said.

Yet Farney adds that the biggest impact will be on sustainability. “The extension of server useful life is a great example of sustainable operations changing operational policies and procedures to reduce carbon footprint” he said. “Obviating hardware refresh reduces carbon impact massively all across the server hardware supply chain from procurement all the way down to the data center raised floor. This new sustainable operations thinking — continuously improving existing environments technologies and procedures — is an incredibly effective evolutionary way to make material impact.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhcmtyZWFkaW5nLmNvbS9jbG91ZC1zZWN1cml0eS91bnVzdWFsLW1pY3Jvc29mdC0zNjUtcGhpc2hpbmctZWZheC1jb21wcm9taXNlZC1keW5hbWljLXZvaWNlLWFjY291bnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Unusual Microsoft 365 Phishing Campaign Spoofs eFax Via Compromised Dynamics Voice Account,"An elaborate and rather unusual phishing campaign is spoofing eFax notifications and using a compromised Dynamics 365 Customer Voice business account to lure victims into giving up their credentials via microsoft.com pages.



Threat actors have hit dozens of companies through the broadly disseminated campaign which is targeting Microsoft 365 users from a diverse range of sectors — including energy financial services commercial real estate food manufacturing and even furniture-making researchers from the Cofense Phishing Defense Center (PDC) revealed in a blog post published Wednesday.

The campaign uses a combination of common and unusual tactics to lure users into clicking on a page that appears to lead them to a customer feedback survey for an eFax service but instead steals their credentials.

Attackers impersonate not only eFax but also Microsoft by using content hosted on multiple microsoft.com pages in several stages of the multistage effort. The scam is one of a number of phishing campaigns that Cofense has observed since spring that use a similar tactic says Joseph Gallop intelligence analysis manager at Cofense.

“In April of this year we began to see a significant volume of phishing emails using embedded ncv[.]microsoft[.]com survey links of the sort used in this campaign” he tells Dark Reading.

Combination of Tactics

The phishing emails use a conventional lure claiming the recipient has received a 10-page corporate eFax that demands his or her attention. But things diverge from the beaten path after that Cofense PDC's Nathaniel Sagibanda explained in the Wednesday post.

The recipient most likely will open the message expecting it's related to a document that needs a signature. ""However that isn't what we see as you read the message body"" he wrote.

Instead the email includes what seems like an attached unnamed PDF file that's been delivered from a fax that does include an actual file — an unusual feature of a phishing email according to Gallop.

""While a lot of credential phishing campaigns use links to hosted files and some use attachments it's less common to see an embedded link posing as an attachment"" he wrote.

The plot thickens even further down in the message which contains a footer indicating that it was a survey site — such as those used to provide customer feedback — that generated the message according to the post.

Mimicking a Customer Survey

When users click the link they are directed to a convincing imitation of an eFax solution page rendered by a Microsoft Dynamics 365 page that's been compromised by attackers researchers said.

This page includes a link to another page which appears to lead to a Microsoft Customer Voice survey to provide feedback on the eFax service but instead takes victims to a Microsoft login page that exfiltrates their credentials.

To further enhance legitimacy on this page the threat actor went so far as to embed a video of eFax solutions for spoofed service details instructing the user to contact ""@eFaxdynamic365"" with any inquiries researchers said.

The ""Submit"" button at the bottom of the page also serves as additional confirmation that the threat actor used a real Microsoft Customer Voice feedback form template in the scam they added.

The attackers then modified the template with ""spurious eFax information to entice the recipient into clicking the link"" which leads to a faux Microsoft login page that sends their credentials to an external URL hosted by attackers Sagibanda wrote.

Fooling a Trained Eye

While the original campaigns were much simpler — including only minimal information hosted on the Microsoft survey — the eFax spoofing campaign goes further to bolster the campaign’s legitimacy Gallop says.

Its combination of multistage tactics and dual impersonation may allow messages to slip through secure email gateways as well as fool even the savviest of corporate users who’ve been trained to spot phishing scams he notes.

""Only the users that continue to check the URL bar at each stage throughout the entire process would be certain to identify this as a phishing attempt"" Gallop says.

Indeed a survey by cybersecurity firm Vade also released Wednesday found that brand impersonation continues to be the top tool that phishers use to dupe victims into clicking on malicious emails.

In fact attackers took on the persona of Microsoft most often in campaigns observed in the first half of 2022 researchers found though Facebook remains the most impersonated brand in phishing campaigns observed so far this year.

Phishing Game Remains Strong

Researchers at this time have not identified who might be behind the scam nor attackers' specific motives for stealing credentials Gallop says.

Phishing overall remains one of the easiest and most oft-used ways for threat actors to compromise victims not only to steal credentials but also spread malicious software as email-borne malware is significantly easier to distribute than remote attacks according to the Vade report.

Indeed this type of attack saw month-over-month increases through the second quarter of the year and then another boost in June that pushed ""emails back to the alarming volumes not seen since January 2022"" when Vade saw upwards of 100-plus million phishing emails in distribution.

""The relative ease with which hackers can deliver punishing cyberattacks via email makes email one of the top vectors for attack and a constant menace for businesses and end users"" Vade's Natalie Petitto wrote in the report. ""Phishing emails impersonate the brands you trust the most offering a wide net of potential victims and a cloak of legitimacy for the phishers masquerading as brands."""

The biotech is specifically looking to boost awareness of mRNA technology in general with no specific promotional branded marketing attached. But the campaign does note Moderna's work on COVID vaccines and in other areas such as how mRNA may help with cancer. It also comes just weeks before the FDA is expected to allow new boosters specific to the omicron variant to be rolled out in the U.S.

Tagging King in its tweet about the campaign this week Moderna’s official corporate account said: “@BillieJeanKing changed tennis and paved the way for athletes by creating a new standard of equity in sports. We believe that challenging convention is critical to changing the world and we are proud to partner with @BillieJeanKing as we kick off our engagement at the @usopen.” King became the first president of the Women's Tennis Association back in 1974 and headed up the first professional women's tour the Virginia Slims.

Moderna has also created a #ChangeMakers hashtag that runs with an accompanying 30-second video. The video has a dramatic violin overture and shows an old TV sitting on a tennis court playing clips of King matches.

It then quickly flips to a full-screen version of King winning a point in a 1970s match with Moderna’s text saying: “She changed tennis. She changed the way women get paid. She changed history.”

We then flip again to King today sitting courtside and saying directly to camera: “Be ahead of your time. That’s how you transform the world.” It ends with a quote saying simply: “Here’s to the change makers.”

This is a clear message about Moderna itself which identifies as a “change maker” by being one of the first companies in the world to use mRNA technology in vaccines.

Moderna's campaign comes several weeks after the U.S. Tennis Association signed a one-year sponsorship deal with the mRNA biotech for this year’s U.S. Open tennis championships which kicks off Friday Aug. 29. Moderna will also get signage space at Arthur Ashe Stadium and aims to spread the message about its mRNA work.

Moderna just this week finished its submission to the FDA for a new emergency use authorization for its tweaked COVID vaccine mRNA-1273.222. Unlike its original COVID vaccine which was authorized in late 2020 the new shot targets subvariants of the dominate omicron variant namely BA.4 and BA.5.

There is no official timeline for when the FDA is expected to finish off its review for the vaccine but Peter Marks M.D. Ph.D. the top vaccine regulator for the FDA told The New York Times this week that his team “was close to authorizing updated doses” such as Moderna’s and from its rival Pfizer which is also seeking authorization for an omicron-specific booster.

The use of mRNA as a new technology which was still relatively in its infancy in early 2020 has not been welcome by all. Misinformation and fears over mRNA use in vaccines caused some people to put off getting vaccinated.

As the booster campaign will likely kick off in the coming weeks or months Moderna knows that the biggest issue will be a general reluctance to get the booster rather than its capacity to produce it. The U.S Open sponsorship should help here and will also go some way to boost its own credentials outside of just COVID vaccines given that its mRNA tech has the potential for use in a range of infectious disease and potentially in oncology and other diseases as well.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpkc3VwcmEuY29tL2xlZ2FsbmV3cy90aGUtY3VycmVudC1tcm5hLWxucC1wYXRlbnQtbGl0aWdhdGlvbi05NTc5NTIxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Current mRNA/LNP Patent Litigation Landscape | Rothwell Figg Ernst & Manbeck P.C. - JDSupra,"Several patent litigations have been filed involving mRNA pioneers such as Moderna Inc. and BioNTech Inc. (with Pfizer) over the past year relating to sales of the Moderna and BioNTech/Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine products (Spikevax® and Comirnaty® respectively). This post provides an overview of those cases other cases involving other mRNA pioneers and the overall mRNA patent litigation landscape as of August 24 2022.[1]

Arbutus and Genevant v. Moderna

On February 28 2022 Arbutus and Genevant sued Moderna in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. The complaint alleges that Moderna infringed a number of Arbutus-owned patents (i.e. U.S. Patent Nos. 8058069 8492359 8822668 9364435 9504651 and 11141378) through at least Moderna’s sale of its Spikevax® vaccine product.

The patents-in-suit are primarily directed to lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery technology comprised of four lipids (i.e. cationic lipid phospholipid conjugated lipid and cholesterol) designed to protect the fragile mRNA “payload” post-injection and release that payload once inside a recipient’s cells. The complaint seeks monetary damages (including based on willful infringement) but does not seek an injunction.

Moderna and Arbutus previously litigated certain of Arbutus’s LNP-based patents before the U.S.P.T.O. where Moderna challenged three of those patents through inter partes review (IPR) proceedings. As previously discussed Moderna was successful in canceling all claims of U.S. Patent No. 9404127 and some claims of the ’435 patent (but not all) and all claims of the ’069 patent survived. As indicated above the ‘435 and ‘069 patents are being asserted in the present case along with a number of other Arbutus patents.

On May 6 2022 Moderna moved to dismiss the infringement claims directed to Moderna’s sales to the U.S. government pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1498(a) (a statute allegedly requiring plaintiffs to seek redress for such infringing sales from the federal government in the Court of Federal Claims rather than from Moderna) which plaintiffs have opposed. This motion does not appear to affect the allegations relating to Moderna’s other (non-U.S. government) sales. In any case the motion is fully briefed and the court recently ordered that the Rule 26(f) scheduling conference need not occur until after disposition of the pending motion to dismiss.

This case is before Judge Mitchell S. Goldberg and the caption for this case is: Arbutus Biopharma Corp. & Genevant Sciences GmbH v. Moderna Inc. & ModernaTX Inc. No. 1:22-cv-00252 (D. Del. filed February 28 2022).

Alnylam v. Moderna and Pfizer

On March 17 2022 Alnylam sued Moderna and Pfizer separately in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. The complaints allege that each of Moderna and Pfizer infringed U.S. Patent No. 11246933 through at least their sales of Spikevax® and Comirnaty® vaccine products respectively. The asserted ’933 patent has claims directed to cationic lipids (one of the four lipid components that encapsulate an mRNA payload in commercialized lipid nanoparticles). The complaints seek monetary damages only (i.e. Alnylam is not seeking an injunction against any of the defendants).

As in the Arbutus case Moderna moved to dismiss the claims directed to Moderna’s sales to the U.S. government pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1498(a) which Alnylam has opposed. Interestingly third parties Arbutus and Genevant are seeking leave of court to file an amicus brief in the Alnylam case with respect to the § 1498(a) issue indicating the larger battle being waged involving the Arbutus LNP technology in Arbutus v. Moderna. These motions are fully briefed. As for Pfizer it answered Alnylam’s complaint and asserted counterclaims joined by BioNTech bringing BioNTech into the case.

On July 12 2022 as the originally-filed cases were pending Alnylam again separately sued Moderna and Pfizer (and this time including BioNTech) in the District of Delaware for infringement of newly granted U.S. Patent No. 11382979 (which issued the same day the suit was filed is directed to an entire lipid nanoparticle and is in the same patent family as the ‘933 patent). The March and July Moderna cases have been consolidated as were the March and July Pfizer/BioNTech cases.

Each consolidated case is before Judge Colm F. Connolly who recently ordered that both scheduling conferences occur before the court on the same date and time unless there are no disputes between the parties with respect to scheduling in which case a scheduling conference would not be necessary. If a scheduling conference is necessary for either or both of the consolidated cases such scheduling conference has been ordered to occur on September 1 2022 at 10:30 am.

The captions for these cases are: Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Moderna Inc. ModernaTX Inc. & Moderna U.S. Inc. No. 1:22-cv-00335 (D. Del. filed Mar. 17 2022); Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Pfizer Inc. & Pharmacia & Upjohn Co. LLC No. 1:99-mc-09999 (D. Del. filed Mar. 17 2022); Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Moderna Inc. ModernaTX Inc. & Moderna U.S. Inc. No. 22-cv-00925 (D. Del. filed July 12 2022); and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Pfizer Inc. Pharmacia & Upjohn Co. LLC BioNTech SE & BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH No. 1:22-cv-00924 (D. Del. filed July 12 2022).

Acuitas v. Arbutus and Genevant

On March 18 2022 one day after the originally-filed Alnylam cases LNP pioneer Acuitas sued Arbutus and Genevant in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking a declaratory judgment that the Pfizer Comirnaty® product does not infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 8058069 8492359 8822668 9364435 9504651 and 11141378 (all owned by Arbutus and asserted in the Moderna case) and U.S. Patent Nos. 9006417 9404127 and 9518272 (all also allegedly owned by Arbutus) and that the subject Arbutus patents are invalid.

Neither Pfizer nor BioNTech have yet been named as a plaintiff in the case but Acuitas has alleged that Pfizer and BioNTech’s Comirnaty® products contain “the lipids and lipid nanoparticles innovated by Acuitas” that are grounded in certain collaborations between Acuitas and BioNTech/Pfizer. Since Acuitas has itself apparently not been accused of infringement and Acuitas apparently does not make or sell the Comirnaty® product one of the key early issues in this case is whether Acuitas has standing to sue.

Defendants have indicated their intention to move to dismiss for lack of standing and the court has indicated that it would entertain such a motion and invited Acuitas to amend its complaint to address arguments raised by Arbutus and Genevant in their proposed motion to dismiss. Acuitas recently (yesterday) indicated that it plans to amend its complaint by September 6 2022. Whether that will include adding Pfizer and/or BioNTech as declaratory judgment plaintiff(s) and/or adding other facts designed to bolster Acuitas’s standing argument remains to be seen.

This case is before Judge Mary Kay Vyskocil and the caption for this case is: Acuitas Therapeutics Inc. v. Genevant Sciences GmbH & Arbutus Biopharma Corp. No. 1:22-cv-02229 (S.D.N.Y. filed Mar. 18 2022).

CureVac v. BioNTech and Pfizer

On July 7 2022 early pioneer and German company CureVac reportedly sued BioNTech (but not Pfizer) in the German Regional Court in Düsseldorf for infringement of one European Patent (EP1857122B1) and three German patents (DE202015009961U1 DE202021003575U1 and DE202015009974U1). These patents appear to be directed to features of the mRNA payload as well as lipids.

Within weeks of CureVac’s suit in Germany on July 25 2022 BioNTech and Pfizer sued CureVac in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts for a declaratory judgment that they do not infringe CureVac’s U.S. Patent Nos. 11135312 11149278 and 11241493 (alleged U.S. counterparts to the European/German patents asserted in Germany). These are cases to watch as BioNTech (and by extension Pfizer) is now confronting infringement allegations by CureVac on two continents.

The U.S. case is before Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton and the caption for that case is: BioNTech SE BioNTech Mfg. Gmbh and Pfizer Inc. v. CureVac AG No. 22-cv-11202 (D. Mass. filed July 25 2022).

Landscape

In summary the patent litigation landscape in the mRNA space is beginning to take shape. Lipid nanoparticle pioneer Arbutus and Genevant filed the first major lawsuit by suing Moderna in February following years of conflict surrounding Arbutus’s LNP technology. On another front for Arbutus and Genevant as Acuitas alleged in its complaint it appears that Arbutus and Genevant may have sent enforcement letters to Pfizer perhaps signaling another future lawsuit against Pfizer and/or BioNTech.

For Acuitas’s part it is suing Arbutus and Genevant over the same patents those parties are asserting in their case against Moderna as well as additional Arbutus patents not asserted in the Moderna case. Whether Acuitas has standing to sue remains to be determined but in any event the case itself could survive dismissal if Pfizer and/or BioNTech were added as a party since each may be able to establish injury in fact. The answer to this standing question could be provided as early as September 6 2022 the date Acuitas informed the court it would be amending its complaint.

Moderna and Pfizer and BioNTech also have to contend with Alnylam which is not currently an mRNA player but does have patents directed to lipids utilized to deliver its small interfering RNA (SiRNA) therapeutics. It appears that the applications that led to the issuance of both of the asserted Alnylam patents were filed after at least the lipid formulation for Comirnaty® was publicly disclosed and it should be anticipated that Alnylam could possibly seek to file for and obtain additional related patents which may also be later asserted in the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNtech cases going forward.

Finally BioNTech and Pfizer are also entangled with CureVac an early mRNA pioneer founded in 2000 (8 years before BioNTech and 10 years before Moderna). CureVac too had a COVID-19 vaccine candidate but that therapy was not fully successful in the clinic and never reached market. CureVac’s aggressive suit in Germany apparently demonstrates how seriously it feels about its infringement claims against BioNTech and BioNTech and Pfizer must also feel strongly about their case since they are now confronting CureVac in the U.S. market by filing a declaratory judgment action against CureVac there asserting non-infringement of CureVac’s corresponding U.S. patents.

It is important to note that none of the patent-holders in any of these cases are currently seeking an injunction asking the court to for example prevent the accused infringers from selling Spikevax® or Comirnaty®. That makes sense from a legal perspective (the chance of any current plaintiff obtaining an injunction may be low here due to lack of directly competing products and significant public interest in allowing the vaccines and boosters to continue to be sold) as well as from a practical perspective (there is little doubt that if the plaintiffs sought an injunction to prevent the distribution of either or both vaccines or related boosters the public backlash against the plaintiffs and perhaps the patent system in general would be severe). Accordingly the exposure in these cases is primarily directed toward monetary damages normally calculated as a “reasonable royalty” (determined following the result of a “hypothetical negotiation”) applied against net sales. With the Spikevax® or Comirnaty® products having achieved tens-of-billions of dollars in net sales and counting such damages awards could be quite significant.

All of these cases are in their very early stages and mRNA market players should monitor the outcomes very closely. If any of the early broad LNP formulation patents are invalidated (or canceled through IPR/post-grant review (PGR) proceedings) that could allow other mRNA market players and new entrants more flexibility in utilizing a wider range of delivery formulations without having to license from such third-party patent-holders.

Alternatively if such patent-holders overcome validity challenges during litigation then those surviving patents would be effectively strengthened after having been battle-tested and using technology covered by those patents may require a license. As is the case with such proceedings some patents may survive some may not some claims of an individual patent may survive some may not and all corresponding results should be monitored closely as applied to a company’s pipeline.

Also if a case settles the subject patents are likely to survive invalidity challenges since in most settlements neither party admits or stipulates to adverse outcomes on the merits including (on the patent-holder’s part) that the asserted patents are not valid. Stipulating to invalidity would likely also destroy some of the patent-holders’ businesses since it appears certain of those business models are based entirely on licensing the subject LNP technology and related know how but not in producing and selling applicable therapeutics.

Expiration dates also play a role in the analysis with some of the early LNP formulation patents set to expire in for example 2029. Given the often long go-to-market runway for pharmaceuticals and biologics 2029 may not be that far away to stage for a commercial launch while minimizing licensing fee obligations. However for companies already in the clinic and with a relatively shorter runway such an expiration date is farther out and the subject patents therefore become more relevant for commercialization considerations.

In conclusion mRNA market players should monitor this landscape and work closely with their business teams and patent counsel to set effective strategies to navigate innovate and succeed in this complex space.

Interim Chief Medical Officer Dr. Autilia Newton speaking at Friday’s COVID press briefing said the UK has said Cayman can have a supply of the new Moderna boosters with the next shipment of vaccines together with the Pfizer vaccines.

“Moderna will be recommended as a booster for the 18-upwards and we will probably target the over-50s and at-risk groups” she said.

Last week the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) approved the vaccine after it was found to meet the regulator’s standards of safety quality and effectiveness.

She did not say how many doses will be arriving when the new shipment is dispatched.

She explained that studies which have just been concluded in the UK do demonstrate that the bivalent Moderna vaccine which targets the original strain plus the latest Omicron sub-variants when used as a booster has a “slightly better effectiveness” in terms of protection from the severe disease.

Newton added that the original Pfizer and the AstraZeneca vaccines are both still effective.

“But the Moderna seems to have a bit of an advantage in that sense against this circulating Omicron variant. We are waiting for the next delivery of the vaccine from the UK government… we have just been told that we should be receiving some Moderna alongside the Pfizer” she said.

Newton said Pfizer is still recommended as the primary vaccination for people taking their first and second doses.

UK reports have said that the new Moderna booster will be rolled out starting next month to 26 million people over 50.

Moderna in a company announcement Monday said it will supply 12 million doses to Canada.

A local report says the Canadian government had entered into a deal with Moderna last year for supply of its COVID-19 vaccine for 2022 and 2023.

Moderna and the Canadian government have now agreed to convert six million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to the Omicron-targetting bivalent vaccine.

Meanwhile Bloomberg reported Tuesday that Moderna plans to request clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration for the new booster.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vZW4udmlldG5hbXBsdXMudm4vdmlldG5hbS10by1zZWN1cmUtbW9yZS1tb2Rlcm5hLXZhY2NpbmUtZm9yLWNoaWxkcmVuLWluLXNlcHRlbWJlci1wb3N0MjM2MTcyLnZucNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vietnam to secure more Moderna vaccine for children in September,"Moderna vaccine (Photo: VNA)

Children get vaccinated against COVID-19 (Photo: VNA)

– More doses of Moderna vaccine against the COVID-19 pandemic will arrive in Vietnam next month to be injected to children aged from six to below 12 according to the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (NIHE).The institute said that Vietnam is currently running short of this type of vaccine to give the second jab for children in this age group.It pointed out that many families had refused to have their children injected with the second dose and a lot of children have to postpone the vaccination as they are sick or infected with COVID-19. Meanwhile Moderna can only be used for a maximum of 30 days since it is defrosted. Therefore many localities have to use this vaccine on adults.According to the Health Ministry’s guidance for children aged under 12 the first and second jabs must use the same vaccine.The ministry’s statistics showed that as of August 23 the country had administered more than 255.1 million doses of vaccines including over 14.8 million for children of five to below 12 years old./."

As participants get older and closer to retirement their financial lives often become more complicated requiring more customized solutions than a target-date fund can provide.

In response some plan sponsors are considering creating multiple qualified default investment alternatives including managed accounts in order to serve the needs of multiple cohorts of employees.

“We have been talking a lot to advisers about these ‘dynamic QDIAs’” says Michael Doshier senior retirement strategist at T. Rowe Price Intermediaries. Typically the scenario discussed involves the automatic enrollment of young participants into a target-date fund and then some trigger—such as age account balance or some combination of similar factors or life events—causes participants to get automatically re-enrolled into a managed account solution.

“There’s a uniform belief now in the industry that the single blunt-force instrument of automation is perfectly fine for a 25-year-old but doing the same things for a 65-year-old could be dangerous” he says.

Under the Pension Protection Act plans have three options for QDIAs: target-date funds managed accounts and balanced accounts. While target-date funds do have a glide path based on a participant’s age managed accounts can take other factors into account including assets outside of the plan preferred retirement dates and their tolerance for risk.

While target-date funds remain the primary choice for most plan sponsors managed account funds have evolved in recent years with new technology bringing down the costs associated with them. But for now when plan sponsors use managed accounts as their QDIA most default all participants into them rather than starting them in a dynamic QDIA also known as a “hybrid QDIA.”

A Demand for Personalization

“Sponsors recognize that people want personalization and that the managed account programs have come a long way in terms of the data points and the personalization and customization has increased” says Nathan Voris director investment insights and consultant services at Schwab Retirement Plan Services in Richfield Ohio. “So you are seeing more adoption there. More advisers are also leveraging managed accounts as a tool in their toolkit or building a collective investment trust that they can use in a managed account.”

Empower Retirement was the first recordkeeper to introduce dynamic QDIAs in 2016 and other recordkeepers including Fidelity Charles Schwab and Principal have followed suit.

“Advisers are taking a much more active role and that is driving adoption of these QDIAs” Voris says. “We are seeing more and more plan sponsors and more and more advisers ask questions about our capabilities in this space and exploring it as an option.”

Voris says that multiple QDIAs are one of the top three discussion topics he engages on with advisers and interest has increased significantly over the past three years. That said adoption from plan sponsors remains low he adds.

“That’s usually the last part to come” he says.

An Opportunity for Engagement

Voris says dynamic QDIAs create an opportunity to engage with participants when they’re transitioning from a target-date fund to managed accounts. Such engagement can inspire an individual to start thinking about retirement Voris says.

That in turn can lead to interest in having a financial plan and provide an opportunity for the plan adviser to provide counseling and guidance. The ultimate outcome can be a participant who is more prepared to make the transition from accumulating assets for retirement to decumulating them in retirement he adds.

For plan sponsors thinking about going that route Voris says they should make sure that the methodology of their target-date funds is in sync with that of the managed accounts. If the target-date funds are passively managed for example the managed accounts should be as well.

In another twist on customizing QDIAs Doshier says that he has also been speaking to some advisers who are starting to advocate for auto-enrolling some worker cohorts into a Roth 401(k) rather than a traditional 401(k).

“Many people who are at low incomes or tax brackets today will likely be at higher tax brackets tomorrow” Doshier says as incomes typically go up over time. So those individuals might be better off paying their taxes upfront now while their tax rate is lower.

Risks to Consider

Some experts think having multiple QDIAs in a plan could prove too risky for plan sponsors.

“I believe that target-date funds will become more customized by plan sponsors over time but right now there’s a lot of risk involved with that” says John Hume vice president at Segal Marco Advisors. “You’re seeing different lawsuits all around.”

Plan committees considering implementing such a structure should carefully document their decision process Hume adds.

“In this litigious environment we are in right now it’s all about the process” Hume says. “You would have to follow a process that’s reasonable with an investment consultant and a plan design consultant and a communications consultant. They would have to all come together and come up with a strategy that’s based on your plan population.”

That documentation should include not only the reasoning behind using a QDIA but also the thought process behind the decumulation strategy if the managed accounts include one Voris says.

Given that managed accounts often require more engagement from participants than target-date funds (so that the manager can customize allocation) one solution might be to require participants to complete an education component before moving them from a target-date fund to a managed account option Hume says.

Dynamic QDIAs are preferable to an approach that uses two completely separate QDIAs within the plan because the latter route could cause confusion among participants says Katie Hockenmaier U.S. defined contribution research director at Mercer.

“It could also foster dissatisfaction if a participant receives targeted communications that one set of funds is intended for them while they actually believe they belong to a different cohort with a different set of funds intended for use” she says.

In addition having multiple QDIAs could stimulate misuse.

“A sponsor can’t restrict participants from using certain funds while permitting other participants to defer into those funds” Hockenmaier explains. “If two or more QDIAs are offered it is possible that participants intended to use one QDIA may opt into another one that is not deemed as appropriate.”

Still Hockenmaier says with careful planning and communication a dynamic QDIA could work and she has seen a small number of plan sponsors implement them successfully. Another solution involves two different plans with different QDIAs. That option is popular among plan sponsors with a cohort of employees who have a legacy defined benefit plan along with their defined contribution assets.

“Sometimes two DC plans are created where those with a DB benefit fall under one DC plan as they will have a specific plan and investment design given that they have known outside company assets that may impact their savings behaviors and those without a DB benefit fall into a separate DC plan” Hockenmaier says. “Given the plans are technically separate and participants have varied needs two different QDIAs could be offered one for each plan.”

The donation is part of the company’s larger $1.5 million investment in BIPOC (Black Indigenous and People of Color) organizations dedicated to equity empowerment justice and community building bringing its total cumulative investment to $4.5 million since 2020.

“Molson Coors recognizes the importance of increasing equitable access to education for students in Colorado and beyond” said Kayla Garcia community affairs manager at Molson Coors. “We are proud to partner with the Denver Scholarship Foundation as they continue to help students cross the finish line to successful completion of their postsecondary education.”

According to data from DSF 100% of DSF scholars demonstrate financial need 90% identify as BIPOC and 88% are first-generation college students. While 82% of DSF scholars are persisting or have graduated in the past six years many DSF scholars do not secure enough aid to cover all their educational experiences forcing them to work multiple jobs extend the number of years in college or even drop out.

DSF partners directly with colleges in Colorado to provide scholarship recipients with extra financial aid and ongoing support to help them succeed and ultimately graduate. The $100000 investment from Molson Coors will support DSF scholars with Crossing the Finish Line scholarships. These scholarships help fill the financial shortage for DSF scholars covering all or a portion of DSF scholars’ gap in Qualified Higher Education Expenses and allowing them to complete their post-secondary credential.

“At DSF we are committed to removing the barriers to college access and completion for Denver Public Schools students” said Lorii Rabinowitz CEO at Denver Scholarship Foundation. “We are grateful to Molson Coors for sharing our passion for fighting for greater diversity equity and inclusion in Colorado and beyond.”

The recall notice posted on Health Canada’s website affects roughly 37379 product units that were sold according to the notice on the Health Canada website.

Truss did not immediately respond to an MJBizDaily request for comment.

The recalled products were sold between April 29 2022 and Aug. 10 2022 in every province except Quebec.

The drinks retail for approximately 7 Canadian dollars ($5.40) apiece.

The recalled XMG Cola cannabis drinks are sold in 355-milliliter cans in the following lots: 520413041 520504051 and 520606051.

Neither Truss nor Health Canada have received complaints from consumers related to the recalled products according to the notice and no adverse-reaction reports have been received.

A notice about the recalled products on the Ontario Cannabis Store website says that some cans were found to “develop pinhole leaks.”

The recall notice asks consumers to contact the retail store where the product was purchased to arrange a return.

President Joe Biden promised to “inflict pain” and deal “a crushing blow” on Vladimir Putin through trade restrictions on commodities like vodka diamonds and gasoline in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine six months ago. But hundreds of other types of unsanctioned goods worth billions of dollars including those found on the ship bound for Baltimore from St. Petersburg Russia continue to flow into U.S. ports.

The Associated Press found more than 3600 shipments of wood metals rubber and other goods have arrived at U.S. ports from Russia since it began launching missiles and airstrikes into its neighbor in February. That’s a significant drop from the same period in 2021 when about 6000 shipments arrived but it still adds up to more than $1 billion worth of commerce a month.

In reality no one involved actually expected trade to drag to a halt after the invasion. Banning imports of certain items would likely do more harm to those sectors in the U.S. than in Russia.

“When we impose sanctions it could disrupt global trade. So our job is to think about which sanctions deliver the most impact while also allowing global trade to work” Ambassador Jim O’Brien who heads the State Department’s Office of Sanctions Coordination told the AP.

Experts say the global economy is so intertwined that sanctions must be limited in scope to avoid driving up prices in an already unstable market.

Also U.S. sanctions don’t exist in a vacuum; layers of European Union and U.K bans result in convoluted trade rules that can be confusing to buyers sellers and policymakers.

For example the Biden administration and the EU released separate lists of Russian companies that cannot receive exports but at least one of those companies — which supplies the Russian military with metal to make fighter jets currently dropping bombs in Ukraine –- is still selling millions of dollars of metal to American and European firms AP found.

While some U.S. importers are sourcing alternative materials elsewhere others say they have no choice. In the case of wood imports Russia’s dense birch forests create such hard strong timber that most American wooden classroom furniture and much home flooring is made from it. Shipping containers of Russian items — groats weightlifting shoes crypto mining gear even pillows — arrive at U.S. ports almost every day.

A breakdown of imported goods from Russia shows some items are clearly legal and even encouraged by the Biden administration like the more than 100 shipments of fertilizer that have arrived since the invasion. Now-banned products like Russian oil and gas continued to arrive in U.S. ports long after the announcement of sanctions due to “wind down” periods allowing companies to complete existing contracts.

In some cases the origin of products shipped out of Russian ports can be difficult to discern. U.S. energy companies are continuing to import oil from Kazakhstan through Russian ports even though that oil is sometimes mixed with Russian fuel. Trade experts warn that Russian suppliers are unreliable and opaque corporate structures of most major Russian companies make it difficult to determine whether they have ties to the government.

“It is a general rule: when you have sanctions you’ll have all kinds of murky schemes and illicit trade” said Russian economist Konstantin Sonin who teaches at the University of Chicago. “Still sanctions make sense because even though you cannot kill 100% of revenues you can reduce them.”

Many American companies are choosing to cut off Russian trade. Coors beer for example returned a shipment of hops to a state-owned Russian company in May as part of a commitment to suspend all business in the country said Molson Coors Beverage Co. spokeswoman Jennifer Martinez.

Russia and the U.S. were never major trading partners and so sanctioning imports is only a very small slice of the retaliatory strategy. Restrictions on exports from the U.S. –- of technology in particular –- cause more damage to the Russian economy and sanctioning the Russian Central Bank has frozen Russia’s access to roughly $600 billion in currency reserves held across the U.S. and Europe.

Nonetheless sanctions carry a symbolic weight beyond the financial harm they might inflict particularly for American consumers horrified by the war.

Here’s a look at some of the goods that have flowed between the two countries:

METALS

Russia is a key exporter of metals like aluminum steel and titanium; cutting off that trade could dramatically drive up prices for Americans already grappling with inflation said Morgan Stanley economist Jacob Nell.

“The basic idea with sanctions is that you’re trying to act in a way that causes more pain to the other side and less pain to yourself” he said.

Most American companies dealing in metals have longstanding relationships with Russian suppliers. Such trade particularly of aluminum has continued virtually uninterrupted since the beginning of the war.

AP found more than 900 shipments totaling more than 264 million tons of metals since February. Russia is one of the largest producers of unwrought aluminum outside of China and a significant global exporter. But the war has affected that global market as well.

“Like all manufacturers” said Aluminum Association spokesperson Matt Meenan “we have seen supply chain impacts in terms of increased energy costs and other inflationary pressures which the invasion exacerbated.”

Russian aluminum ends up in American car parts and airplanes soda cans and cables ladders and solar racks. The largest U.S. buyer at the start of 2022 was a subsidiary of Russian-owned global aluminum giant Rusal. In April Rusal America’s senior executives bought the U.S.-based part of the company and rebranded it as PerenniAL. In July alone PerenniAL imported more than 35000 tons from Russia. The company did not respond to requests for comment.

Also among the private companies choosing to source materials from Russia are U.S. government contractors supported by federal tax dollars. Boeing the world’s largest aerospace company signed a federal contract for up to $23.8 billion in 2021; it imported 20 tons of aluminum in June from Kamensk-Uralsky Metallurgical Works. In March the U.S. banned exports to Kamensk-Uralsky because it supplies metals to the Russian military but placed no restrictions on imports. A Boeing representative said the company made the decision to end trade with Russia in March and explained that the shipment that arrived in June had been purchased four months before.

Another metal importer Tirus US is owned by Russian company VSMPO-AVISMA the world’s largest titanium producer. VSMPO also provides metal to the Russian military to build fighter jets. The company’s broad global footprint and specific product — titanium — underscores the challenges of isolating Russia from global trade. Tirus US sells titanium to more than 300 companies in 48 countries including a range of U.S. buyers from jewelry makers to aerospace companies.

The company said only that due to significant challenges in the U.S. it has been working with several American companies to alleviate supply chain issues.

WOOD

Russia’s vast forests are some of the largest in the world. After Canada Russia is the second largest exporter of wood and has some of the only mills that can make strong solid Baltic birch plywood flooring used throughout the U.S.

This year the Biden administration began imposing tariffs on Russian wood exports a move which infuriated Ronald Liberatori a Nevada-based wood dealer who sells Russian grown Baltic birch to all the major furniture makers construction companies and flooring manufacturers in the U.S.

“The problem here is Russia is the only country in the world that makes this product” he said. “There’s no alternative source.”

He said that on top of the tariff he had to put up an $800000 bond to ensure he’d pay the tax further driving up prices.

“Who’s paying for this? Who? You and every other individual in the United States” he said. “We’re so damned upset with what Biden has done. This is a government versus government issue.”

Liberatori said decision-makers need to consider who is going to be more hurt by tariffs before imposing them.

Another wood and paper importer told AP that while it stopped any new orders in February it had vast amounts of lumber in Russia that already had been paid for; the final shipment arrived in the U.S. in July.

FUEL

On March 8 Biden announced the United States is banning all imports of Russian oil gas and energy “targeting the main artery of Russia’s economy.”

“That means Russian oil will no longer be acceptable at U.S. ports and the American people will deal another powerful blow to Putin’s war machine” he said.

Within hours there were reports that a ship carrying 1 million barrels of Russian oil to the U.S. changed course to France. But plenty of others pushed on.

That week about a million barrels of Russian crude oil had arrived off the port of Philadelphia bound for Delta Airlines’ oil refinery Monroe Energy. Meanwhile a tanker with about 75000 barrels of Russian tar oil pulled into the port of Texas City Texas bound for Valero’s refineries after a long north Atlantic crossing according to trade records.

The shipments continued to Valero ExxonMobil and others. ExxonMobil media manager Julie King told AP a July oil delivery was of Kazakh origin and not subject to sanctions. She said Exxon “supports the internationally coordinated efforts to bring Russia’s unprovoked attack to an end and are complying with all sanctions.”

Monroe spokesman Adam Gattuso said the company has not received any more Russian fuel and doesn’t “anticipate doing so for the foreseeable future.” Valero did not respond to requests for comment.

Andrea Schlaepfer a spokesperson for Dutch fuel exporter Vitol said that all of its oil and gas shipments since April 22 have been from Kazakhstan where pipelines and rail networks run from the landlocked country’s oil fields and refineries to neighboring Russian ports.

For the use of its port infrastructure moorings and fees Russia makes about $10 million each year.

Schlaepfer said U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents review and verify that its shipments entering the U.S. don’t contain Russian products. But CBP did not answer repeated questions about how it handles sanctions and bans on Russian goods. A CBP fact sheet says it plays a “critical role” in enforcing prohibitions on imports however a spokesman repeatedly referred The AP to the State and Treasury departments.

OTHER

So far this year almost 4000 tons of Russian bullets have also arrived in the U.S. where they were distributed to gun shops and ammo dealers. Some were sold to U.S. buyers by Russian state-owned companies while others came from at least one sanctioned oligarch. Those shipments slowed significantly after April.

AP also tracked millions of dollars worth of shipments of radioactive uranium hexafluoride from Russian state-owned Tenex JSC the world’s largest exporter of initial nuclear fuel cycle products to Westinghouse Electric Co. in South Carolina. Nuclear material is not sanctioned.

Westinghouse spokeswoman Cathy Mann said that as part of the nuclear fuel manufacturing process their fuel fabrication facilities receive enriched uranium product and convert it into fuel pellets. She said Westinghouse doesn’t own the uranium used to make fuel. That material belongs to customers who operate nuclear power plants throughout the world.

“As a result our customers have the accountability to determine where and from whom the materials are procured – some of which is sourced from Russia or enriched by a Russian company” she said. “Westinghouse condemns Russia’s invasion and the resulting hostility and loss of life.”

In addition some of the products sent to the U.S. from Russian ports continue on to Mexico and Canada. Toyota vehicle components for example arrived last month in New Orleans bound for a Mexican plant run by Toyota Tshusho the car company’s trading arm.

Radioactive material sent from Russia to the U.S. is hauled north of the border to sterilize packaged medical supplies used throughout North America.

Although imports of some food items such as seafood and vodka have been restricted the Treasury Department last month published a fact sheet reiterating that agricultural trade between the U.S. and Russia is still very much allowed.

The Red October chocolate factory sits just across from the Kremlin in Moscow. Today it’s a tourist attraction with apartments stores and restaurants. But the company Krasny Oktyabr still makes and sells candy and other traditional treats from a production plant on the outskirts of Russia.

In Brooklyn New York Grigoriy Katsura at the U.S. offices of Krasnyi Oktyabr Inc said they continue to import delectables a taste of childhood for Russian immigrants.

“Of course they’re used to it” he said.

And so every few weeks the shipments arrive at their warehouse from Russia: buckwheat dried fruit and their world-renowned chocolate.

Fact-Check The Verdict False The pattern on Oreo cookies is an updated version of the Nabisco company logo. There's no evidence that it carries a secret message. Claim ID 546b264a





Context:

A recent Facebook post shares two images; the first is of an Oreo cookie highlighting the double cross symbol on top of the word ""OREO."" The second image details a cross on the imprint- which the user compares to the Satanic cross a Freemason's cross and the Zodiac wheel. The post explains that the popular cookie is an example of how ""the elite infiltrates you through symbols."" Similar conspiratorial claims surrounding the origins of the popular snack have been circulating since 2014 across various platforms.





In fact:

Consumers have associated the iconic cookie pattern with a number of sinister meanings throughout the years. A Business Insider article notes that the design has been associated with the Cross of Lorraine the emblem used by Christian Pilgrims in the First Crusade. The article also notes that ""while some people do recognize this ancient emblem most consumers see it as a four-leaf clover with each leaf emphasizing hope faith love and luck."" Any such associations or similarities do not prove that the item is based on anything specifically despite people's associations.





It's important to note that the Oreo cookie's design has evolved over several decades and was likely originally based on the long discontinued Hydrox cookie pattern in 1912 which had a simpler botanical design. In 1924 the design was revamped to include two turtle doves. The 1952 version has the closest resemblance to the imprint we see today. It is the same design shared by Oreo's parent company Nabisco which is recognized as a European symbol of peace.





It is widely believed that late designer William Turnier a design engineer for Nabisco is behind the design. U.S. magazine Mental Floss reached out to Bill Turnier the designer's son for insights. Turnier said that his father had no interest in religious or spiritual symbolism and that his choices were aesthetic. Turnier told Mental Floss that his father was inspired by fireweed the four-petal flower from his backyard and early Medival manuscripts. He added that his father probably used a compass to ensure the ridges at the end were evenly spaced. The article adds that ""the small triangles near the word ""Oreo"" were probably added to avoid having any empty space on the cookie's face."" However Nabisco has never offered an official explanation for the design and has noted that it does not have a record of Turnier as the designer.





While the origins of the cookie's design remain mysterious the post's far-fetched conspiratorial reasoning behind the design is baseless. The post suggests the presence of a secret powerful cabal who are secretly planning to arrest and enslave the population. This is part of the New World Order conspiracy theory which has historic antisemitic roots and can lead to real-life threats to Jewish communities whether intentional or not.





Verdict:

There's no clear explanation for the symbols embossed on Oreo cookies but there's also no evidence to suggest that this goes beyond anything other than aesthetics and marketing as the logo has been updated numerous times. The symbols associated with conspiracy theories can be seen in numerous ordinary objects by those seeking validation for their beliefs but this does not act as proof of their existence. As such we've marked the claim as false.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMjUvdGlrdG9rLWNyZWF0b3JzLWFyZS1jYWxsaW5nLW91dC1idXNpbmVzc2VzLW9uLXNocmlua2ZsYXRpb24tLmh0bWzSAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMi8wOC8yNS90aWt0b2stY3JlYXRvcnMtYXJlLWNhbGxpbmctb3V0LWJ1c2luZXNzZXMtb24tc2hyaW5rZmxhdGlvbi0uaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tired of paying more for less shoppers take to TikTok to call out companies for 'shrinkflation’,"Hunter Jarratt was a frequent buyer of Quaker's apple oats bars — until he realized the size of his favorite snack has decreased in size even though the packaging looks the same. Hunter Jarratt

Hunter Jarratt was a frequent buyer of Quaker's apple oats bars — until he realized the size of his favorite snack was decreasing in size even though the packaging looked the same. In his TikTok video he pointed out that an old bar weighed 26 grams and costs $1.90 normally. But an oat bar now costs ""well over $2"" at 24 grams he claimed. That means each gram in the 26-gram bar costs $0.073 while it costs slightly more — at least $0.083 per gram — for the smaller 24-gram bar according to CNBC's calculations. ""What it does have — is more air"" he said tongue-in-cheek.

That's when Jarratt realized ""shrinkflation"" was at work — where some companies are reducing the contents of their packaging without raising the sticker price and in so doing charging consumers more. PepsiCo — which owns Quaker and other household names such as beverages like Gatorade and Lipton Tea as well as Lays potato chips — did not respond to CNBC's request for comment. Not only are consumers spending more on everyday goods they're also getting less than what they used to — and young people like Jarratt are not happy. Like Jarratt many are now taking to TikTok to call out companies that have reduced the size of products. There were more than 261 million views of short videos related to ""shrinkflation"" on TikTok as of Thursday according to the social media platform.

It's difficult enough to keep up with the rising cost of living already and when businesses start reducing the sizes of their items it makes things worse. Claudia Valladares Financial advisor

In July PepsiCo raised its revenue outlook for the year as inflation pushed up prices and consumers paid more for its products. Expecting costs to rise even higher in the second half of the year the global food and drink giant said at that time it plans to keep shrinking product sizes and deploying other ways to manage rising expenses. How has shrinkflation impacted young people and are there ways to overcome it? CNBC Make It finds out.

Why is 'shrinkflation' happening?

In times of rising inflation companies have to grapple with rising costs for ingredients packaging labor and transportation. Even fast food chains like McDonald's and Domino's Pizza are shrinking their value meals and increasing prices to protect their margins.

For Krishnan Kara 23 it was Cadbury's chocolate bars. ""They used to be 200g for £2 and are now 180g for £2. A 10% drop in size but the price is still the same"" the digital marketer from London said. ""I was annoyed ... Instead of openly increasing the prices of goods with inflation these big brands chose to make the amount of product less."" In an email response to CNBC Make It a Mondelez International spokesperson said that ""significantly increased production costs"" have made it much more expensive to produce its goods. Mondelez International owns Cadbury and other snacks like Oreo Ritz and Toblerone. ""We understand that consumers are faced with rising costs too which is why we look to absorb costs wherever we can"" Mondelez International said without elaborating.

Inflation and shrinkflation are really having a huge impact on groceries and the bottom line of just about everyone. Drew Lee @dollarswithdrew

The spokesperson added that it is the first time since 2012 that the size of medium Cadbury Dairy Milk bars have been reduced. Drew Lee 31 acknowledged that it's as important as ever for companies to ""do whatever they need to do to maintain their profit levels."" ""As a consumer I don't like [shrinkflation]. But I get why companies are doing it. Everyone has to make money"" said the industrial engineer.

Food 'not lasting as long'

Even so individuals whom CNBC Make It spoke to remain adamant that shrinkflation will hurt consumers. ""Inflation and shrinkflation are really having a huge impact on groceries and the bottom line of just about everyone"" said Lee. Lee added that he noticed shrinkflation was at work because he would typically pour his packaged oatmeal from Target's private-label brand Good & Gather into a different storage container. ""I noticed that it did not fill up the entire container like it normally would. If I didn't pour the oatmeal into a different container I definitely would not have noticed this"" he said.

CNBC Make It reached out to Target for comment and a spokesperson confirmed the company has not made any changes to its oatmeal packaging or product since its release in 2020. ""Shrinkflation is an attempt to trick customers into thinking they are paying the same price for an item when in reality they are paying a higher cost per unit for that item"" insisted Lee the engineer. Claudia Valladares a financial advisor said that shrinkflation is a cause for concern especially for ""individuals who are on a tight budget."" ""It's difficult enough to keep up with the rising cost of living already and when businesses start reducing the sizes of their items it makes things worse.""

Either I am choosing alternative products or unfortunately having to spend more money on food … that is just adding more debt in the long-run. Hunter Jarratt @invasivespeciesguy

Jarratt agreed saying that that food is ""not lasting as long"" now that inflation and shrinkflation have become more intense. ""I am a university student on student loans … I have an allocated amount of money for food"" the 22-year-old added. ""Either I am choosing alternative products or unfortunately having to spend more money on food … that is just adding more debt in the long-run.""

Here's what you can do

Jarratt's personal experiences with rising costs of living and shrinkflation propelled him to create a TikTok video — even though he admitted it's not his ""usual content"" as an environmental educator. ""It is hard to truly be a conscientious consumer at the grocery store when most products are owned only by a handful of companies. But when you do spot a change it's important to speak up"" he said. ""People are definitely starting to catch on. A slight package change isn't going to fool anyone."" Other than creating awareness here's what some are doing to get by:

1. Pay close attention to prices and quantities

It is more important now than ever to pay attention to prices and make comparisons between stores when doing grocery shopping said Lee. ""You could be throwing away a dollar here and there which will have a huge impact over time.""

Kara added that he is now paying more attention to the price per gram of food items. ""Something may look cheaper but the price per gram is higher than the same product that's more expensive"" he pointed out.

2. No shame in 'no-name'

Another way to tackle shrinkflation could be to abandon your loyalty to particular brands. Jarratt said when he notices an item has shrunk he would switch to another brand. ""For example instead of buying Quaker's oats bars I would rather buy Nature Valley's bars by General Mills which at least still leave me feeling like I ate something"" he said. ""I may also buy a 'no-name' brand granola bar which is cheaper than other brands and still somewhat filling as a snack.

He observed that smaller lesser-known companies may have increased their prices but the sizes of products seem to have stayed the same. ""I would purchase from companies like that and where possible and affordable local businesses too.""

3. Consider buying in bulk

Valladares the financial advisor said that buying in bulk would typically allow you to ""get a discount on the overall purchase."" ""This is because retailers know that they will be selling a larger quantity of the product and are willing to give a price break"" she explained. ""It also allows you to take advantage of economies of scale – the per-unit cost of the product decreases as the quantity increases.""

It's always a good idea to compare the price per unit before making your purchase.

And consumers are certainly responding to that as is the trade”​ he said noting distribution has grown 54% and household penetration has doubled in the past year alone.

“So we're on our way but I think our voice will become louder as we move into 2023.”​

One of the challenges has been to establish that footprint with retailers to create that destination for consumers.

“Until now many retailers [‘hid’] the bars in this giant yoghurt mass … so we’re really trying to carve out a section where the perfect bar and Clio can reside and provide that destination for the consumer”​ said McGuckin.

Clio’s chief marketing officer Rachel Moore echoed McGuckin’s ‘overarching strategy’ to see Clio placed “where every refrigerated snack is sold … and when we expose consumers to this product 76% want to purchase. And so we have a very large base that we have an opportunity to go after and we're excited to continue to drive more consumers into the brand” ​she said.

The rise of ‘smeals’

McGuckin believes the snackification trend – or ‘smeals’ (the intersection between snacking and meals) as he calls it – has been developing for the past 5-6 years but was given impetus thanks to COVID.

“Snacking continues to grow with 62% of consumers replacing at least one meal a day with a snack. We’ve seen that because of the pandemic in particular. There’s been a big growth in online purchases and fewer trips to the grocery store [meaning] consumers tended to load up. So [there’s been an increase in] value buys and deals.​

“But still remaining through it all is a growth and desire for permissible indulgence.”​

Added Moore “Consumers are looking for brands but in different places than they did pre-pandemic. We’ve seen consumers shift to dot.com so we have to intercept then there when they're searching for bars or yogurt versus on shelf.​

“We still see a large percentage of our consumers walking into the store now especially two years later and we have to find them there as well.​

“Through the pandemic though people still wanted to indulge … we all felt a little scared and the future was unknown so [the need for] indulgence rose and Clio was there [with] ‘permissible indulgence’. What Clio does unbelievably well is take something that's innately permissible – Greek yoghurt – and make it indulgent.”​

Innovation on the back burner?

According to McGuckin the current inflationary environment is compounding the pressures felt by the sector and it is innovation that has taken a knock.

“I think that to a large degree due to inflationary and margin pressures a lot of companies have resisted innovation. It's become risky to a certain extent as they're struggling with labour [shortages] and struggling with inflation. Companies have [focused] on optimising themselves and protecting their core … at the expense of innovation.​

“I do think we’ve seen much less innovation since the pandemic began. Hopefully as things turn in 2023 we will begin to see more innovation” ​said McGuckin. In our podcast interview he also delves into the challenges currently facing the dairy sector.

“We’re challenged with the same things as everyone else but I think we’ve been very fortunate that we [focused] on innovation.​

“We’ve been able to expand our flavour offerings and … now we’re introducing multi-packs which is a critical consumer trend that’s developing. People are buying more multipacks and we're going to be participating in that at the beginning in September.”​

While McGuckin said going plant-based is currently not in the works it is a concept the New Jersey company is keeping on its radar. Particularly as his five year strategy is hoping to emulate Clif Bar’s $2.9bn acquisition by Mondelez International migrating the bar category into the refrigerated environment.

“We’ll continue to attract attention and the category will develop significantly”​ he said adding Clio is aiming to grow its retail footprint even further and debut in foodservice in colleges universities airports and hospitality.

“So for us it’s really about welcoming new users and continuing to foster the relationship with those who are huge fans and loyalists of this brand … and continue to build from there”​ said Moore.

Fighting for Ukraine

Sergey Konchakovskiy grew up in Kiev and graduated as a doctor but did not practice medicine. Instead he immigrated to the US in his 20s landing a job for Entenmann’s and then Wonderful Company in the financial division. The refrigerated yoghurt bars essentially got their foundation ‘by accident’ but also harking back on a childhood treat.

As a Ukrainian national the current conflict is obviously high on Clio Snacks’ agenda.

“This is something Sergey is extremely passionate about and we as an organisation are continuing to try and find ways to continue the support” ​said Moore.

“Back in March … we executed a pretty large fundraise with our consumers. We matched donations or matched purchases on our website and donated this to Razom for Ukraine”​ a non-profit human rights organisation established to support the people of Ukraine in their pursuit of a democratic society with dignity justice and human and civil rights.

“We’ve also donated medical supplies and helped supplement the support that delivery of those goods to Ukraine. Then actually just a couple weeks ago we had our company picnic and were able to build these medical kits in person. We built over 100 medical kits and will continue to be executing these kinds of support initiatives.”​

The research firm noted the global chocolate market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.7 percent over the next six years. Meanwhile the global cocoa market is projected to reach $26.3 billion by 2027 growing at a CAGR of 4.5 percent.

MarketsandMarkets pointed to consumers’ interest in prioritizing their health as a factor in driving demand for dark chocolate with higher cocoa content as well as for cosmetics and pharmaceuticals that use cocoa. However citing data from the International Cocoa Organization factors such as fair trade discrepancies environmental issues government unrest and a reduction in labor force could impact the market. Measures such as the National Cocoa Development Plan (NCDP) are being undertaken to improve cocoa production.

“Initiatives like these give a promising outlook toward fulfilling the rising demand for cocoa globally” reads MarketsandMarkets’ statement on the report. “The cocoa and chocolate market players are showing trends of pursuing both organic as well as inorganic strategies for their expansion consolidation and sustainability in the market.”

Though the health benefits of dark chocolate — such as the presence of fiber iron magnesium potassium and phosphorus — have contributed toward an upward trend in demand MarketsandMarkets estimates milk chocolate will dominate the chocolate market in 2022 and throughout the forecast period.

Meanwhile conventional cocoa is expected to lead the cocoa market in 2022 given their availability and cost. However the organic cocoa segment is estimated to see a higher growth rate during the forecast period owing to its health benefits and environment friendliness.

The Asia Pacific region will see the fastest growth rate — 5.72 percent — during the forecast period. The Chinese cocoa market in terms of volume is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 6.39 percent. This is attributed to the strong demand for chocolate in the country.

Across Europe Germany consumed the most chocolate in 2021 followed by the UK and Belgium. The United States accounted for the largest market share primarily driven by large consumption of confectionery and bakery items.

Citing data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC) the U.S. was the seventh largest exporter of chocolate in 2020 with key export destinations being Canada Mexico South Korea Australia and the UK. Growth in this region is attributed to the growing population rise in per capita income growing urbanization and therefore an increase in demand for chocolate-based products.

The key players in the cocoa and chocolate markets include Mars Inc. Mondelez International Nestle S.A. Meiji Holding Co. Ltd.

""We have no desire to sell Bang Energy"" CEO Jack Owoc tells Richard. ""My guess is that (Keurig Dr Pepper) might be in talks with C4. KDP’s energy portfolio represents less than 1% of sales.""

C4 a subsidiary of Nutrabolt has been held by private equity firm MidOcean Partners since 2014.

Why it's the BFD: The buzz around such brands deal or no deal makes sense considering how frenzied that M&A market has been.

Constellation Brands was previously reported to be in talks to merge with Monster Beverage while PepsiCo invested $550 million in Celsius this month.

What's happening: Bloomberg reported last week that Keurig Dr Pepper was in talks to acquire Bang. Keurig Dr Pepper has since said it is not currently pursuing Bang.

What they're saying: Asked about its interest in acquiring C4 or another energy drink brand a Keurig Dr Pepper spokesperson said:

“Our top capital allocation priority is growing our business through M&A and brand/distribution partnerships which we have proven we can execute to create value. Therefore we look at a lot of opportunities and we don’t pursue many of them.”

MidOcean declined to comment. Nutrabolt did not respond to requests for comment.

By the numbers: Bloomberg's report from Aug. 18 said Bang could be valued at $2 billion or more or in excess of $3 billion.

""Bang sales (are) $5 billion in just the past few years and $1.44 billion last year"" Owoc says.

""Let’s look at some recent comps"" Owoc says. ""Rockstar sold to Pepsi for $4.55 billion ($3.85 billion and $700 million in tax credits) with ~50 consecutive negative growth reads and now has ~60% less market share than Bang Energy.""

Yes and: Owoc notes that ""Rockstar and Celsius (are) number 4 and 5 in the energy drink category.""

""Celsius just did a deal with Pepsi based on a $6.5 billion valuation with ~4% market share.""

""Bang has a roughly 57% larger market share of the energy drink category (~6.3%) than Celsius.""

""Using the $6.5 billion Celsius valuation and the same market share calculation Bang Energy would be valued at $10.2 billion.""

""This far exceeds the $2 billion to $3 billion valuation reported by Bloomberg"" Owoc concludes.

Tip 1. Skip Carbonated Energy Drinks

If you're feeling bloated have heartburn or some other symptom of indigestion you may find temporary relief from sipping a carbonated beverage like soda or energy drinks. However Butler explains that this may be doing more harm for your gut than good. ""Carbonated energy drinks can negatively affect gut health because they can cause gastric distress interfere with nutrient absorption and contribute to diarrhea"" she says.

Firstly Butler notes that they can ""stimulate the release of acid in your stomach"" which can actually lead to more heartburn and indigestion. Secondly the ""high sugar content in these drinks can cause diarrhea by pulling water into your intestine"" (which also leads to dehydration). The caffeine in these drinks can also contribute to diarrhea by increasing intestinal motility she warns. ""The worst kind of carbonated drink would be highly caffeinated sugary energy drinks like Monster or Red Bull"" she continues. These drinks she reiterates can cause issues like ""diarrhea malabsorption and dehydration. ""

2. Choose Kombucha Instead

If you still like to sip on a fizzy beverage and want to choose one that is *actually good* for your gut Hunnes recommends kombucha. Kombucha she says is a fermented tea drink that is ""high in beneficial probiotics and also high in antioxidants (from the tea)."" The probiotics and the antioxidants are anti-inflammatory and can ""aid in promoting GI health by helping to colonize the GI tract with healthy bacteria (known as probiotics)"" she continues.

The antioxidants within the beverage ""also help keep the inflammation away"" according to Hunnes promoting the health of the probiotics as well. ""It is also thought that kombucha can slow down the digestion of carbohydrates by likely in-part because of the healthy anti-inflammation effects it has on the GI tract"" she adds. With so many flavors of kombucha to choose from Hunnes suggests that it is easy to replace your favorite high-sugar and unhealthy soda or energy drink with the tea instead. ""There are so many healthy benefits from drinking kombucha which have been taken for hundreds of years"" she concludes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyZW5kaHVudGVyLmNvbS90cmVuZHMvcm9ja3N0YXItcmVjb3ZlcnnSAThodHRwczovL3d3dy50cmVuZGh1bnRlci5jb20vYW1wL3RyZW5kcy9yb2Nrc3Rhci1yZWNvdmVyeQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Collagen-Enhanced Energy Drinks,"Rockstar Recovery Now Comes in Two New Enhanced Flavors

Given its connection to gaming it feels natural for Monster to tap into this primal imagery with the name of its new alcoholic drink: The Beast Unleashed. Due to be released in the US in the final quarter of this year the flavoured malt beverage represents the brand’s first venture into alcohol with a 6% abv.

This launch is likely to drift over to this side of the Atlantic. Today The Grocer reports the company has applied to register the trademark in the UK. Such a move was always likely given the parallels between the markets. US companies have been busy promoting hard seltzer over here – and The Beast Unleashed is being positioned as a challenger to these drinks.

For now it is unclear whether the drink will contain the caffeine that has become synonymous with Monster. That proposition may prove challenging in the US where health authorities have been wary of brands mixing alcohol and caffeine for more than a decade.

Back in November 2010 the US Food & Drug Administration asked suppliers to withdraw alcoholic energy drinks from the market. This followed reports of several high-alcohol high-caffeine brands leading to excessive student drinking. One brand – Four Loko – had even been described as a “blackout in a can”.

But the situation in the UK is different. Here alcoholic energy brand Dragon Soop – carrying a 7.5% abv and 175mg of caffeine per 500ml can – has been steadily expanding beyond its Scottish heartland. Last year sales grew by 9.8% to £23.4m [NielsenIQ 52 w/e 30 April 2022].

In March it was joined by WKD X which boasts a 7% abv and 150mg of caffeine in each 500ml can. At the time of the launch SHS’s head of WKD Alison Gray said the “fledgling drink type” was an opportunity to show consumers another side of the brand.

It’s hard to imagine Monster avoiding this growing market for alcoholic energy if it launches The Beast Unleashed into the UK. Even if caffeine is absent – which it may have to be if it wants to achieve consistency with the US – the product will likely still play on the energy cues that have made Monster such a huge success.

This could help cement alcoholic energy drinks as a mainstream proposition. Things have already moved on since the start of the year when Dragon Soop represented the entire category (if you discount Buckfast tonic wine). The addition of another major brand may help establish the idea.

Or it could go the other way and the high-profile launch may draw the attention of British health authorities to the category. Dragon Soop has been linked to anti-social behaviour and crime much like its peers in the US – even if it has avoided any rebuke beyond the Portman Group’s warning that shoppers should not see the drinks as an energy source.

Even if Monster’s drink doesn’t contain caffeine the very name The Beast Unleashed could well provoke the ire of authorities. After all they are unlikely to take kindly to the idea of drinkers adopting aggressive animalistic personas. So Monster had better tread carefully – or it may be forced to put the beast back in its cage."
MCO,Moody's Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9tb29keS1kb3duZ3JhZGUtdS1ob21lLXByaWNlcy0wODUwMzcwNDUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These 183 housing markets could soon see home prices fall 20% Moody's says,"Back in May Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi came to Fortune with a bold proclamation: The U.S. housing market was entering into a “housing correction.” Through the summer Zandi said U.S. housing activity would plummet. As it did Zandi said home prices in bubbly markets like Phoenix and Boise would begin falling.

At the time Zandi’s prediction was dismissed by many in the real estate industry. Housing bulls thought that tight supply and favorable millennial first-time homebuyer demographics would continue to propel the Pandemic Housing Boom forward despite spiked mortgage rates. They were wrong and Zandi was right: This summer housing activity contracted sharply across the board while bubbly markets like Boise and Las Vegas have already started to see price cuts.

This week Zandi let Fortune know that Moody’s Analytics was downgrading its initial forecast. Over the coming year Zandi now predicts U.S. house prices will shift somewhere between 0% to -5%. Heading into June Moody’s Analytics expected U.S. house prices to remain unchanged over the coming year.

That baseline forecast assumes the U.S. won’t enter into a recession. If a recession hits Moody’s Analytics now predicts U.S. house prices will fall between -5% to -10%. That’s up from June when Zandi told Fortune that a recession would see U.S. house prices fall by less than -5%.

Historically speaking nominal home price declines are rare—but they do happen on occasion. It occurred briefly in the early ’80s—after spiked interest rates pushed the economy into a recession—and then again in the early ’90s. However double-digit home price declines are rare. Only the Great Depression and the Great Recession have seen price cuts of that magnitude. The fact an esteemed macroeconomist like Zandi raises the possibility of a -10% home price dip is well eyebrow raising.

Every quarter Moody’s Analytics assesses whether local economic fundamentals including local income levels can support local house prices. At the latest reading Moody’s Analytics finds 183 of the nation’s 413 largest regional housing markets are “overvalued” by more than 25%. That includes markets like Boise (overvalued by 72%) Charlotte (overvalued by 66%) and Austin (overvalued by 61%). The vast majority of these significantly overvalued markets are concentrated in boomtowns in the Mountain West and Sunbelt that benefited from the pandemic’s work-from-home trend.

Simply being overvalued doesn’t guarantee that home prices will decline. However it does matter. Historically speaking when a housing market “rolls over” it’s significantly overvalued markets that are at highest risk for price declines. That’s the case now Zandi says. Heading forward Moody’s Analytics expects the 183 markets overvalued by more than 25% (see the map above for a comprehensive view) to see home prices decline by -10% to -15%. That’s assuming a recession doesn’t manifest. If a recession hits Moody’s Analytics expects those 183 significantly overvalued regional housing markets to decline by -15% to -20%.

Story continues

That’s a sizable downgrade. Back in June Moody’s Analytics predicted significantly overvalued markets would decline by -5% to -10%.

Moody’s Analytics isn’t alone. There’s a growing chorus of research firms that are forecasting home prices will soon fall nationally. That includes John Burns Real Estate Consulting Capital Economics Pantheon Macroeconomics Zelman & Associates and Zonda. Economist Robert Shiller who predicted the 2008 housing crash thinks a greater than -10% home price dip could be in the cards. Meanwhile Fitch Ratings says there’s a scenario where U.S. home prices fall by -10% to -15%.

Not every forecaster has turned bearish. Over the coming year the Mortgage Bankers Association Fannie Mae Freddie Mac CoreLogic and Zillow all predict a low single-digit rise in home prices.

It’s pretty straightforward: As long as mortgage rates remain elevated housing transactions (i.e. home sales) will remain sluggish. Home prices are a different story. While homebuilders and investors might be more inclined to cut prices average joe sellers will resist doing so. There’s an emotional element: Sellers don’t want to give up on the number in their head. Not to mention a solid job market means sellers aren’t desperate. All of that seller hesitancy coupled with uncertainty surrounding inflation and the broader economy explains why so many forecasters remain split on the trajectory for home prices.

The move could boost support for his fellow Democrats in the November congressional elections but some economists said it may fuel inflation and some Republicans in the U.S. Congress questioned whether the president had the legal authority to cancel the debt.

Debt forgiveness will free up hundreds of billions of dollars for new consumer spending that could be aimed at homebuying and other big-ticket expenses according to economists who said this would add a new wrinkle to the country's inflation fight.

The actions are ""for families that need them the most - working and middle class people hit especially hard during the pandemic"" Biden said during remarks at the White House. He pledged no high-income households would benefit addressing a central criticism of the plan.

""I will never apologize for helping working Americans and middle class especially not to the same folks who voted for a $2 trillion tax cut that mainly benefited the wealthiest Americans and the biggest corporations"" Biden said referring to a Republican tax cut passed under former President Donald Trump.

Borrower balances have been frozen since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak with no payments required on most federal student loans since March 2020. Many Democrats had pushed for Biden to forgive as much as $50000 per borrower.

Republicans mostly opposed student loan forgiveness calling it unfair because it will disproportionately help people earning higher incomes.

""President Biden's student loan socialism is a slap in the face to every family who sacrificed to save for college every graduate who paid their debt and every American who chose a certain career path or volunteered to serve in our Armed Forces in order to avoid taking on debt"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday.

The administration has yet to determine the price tag for the package which will depend on how many people apply for it White House domestic policy adviser Susan Rice told reporters. Student loans obtained after June 30 this year are not eligible she said.

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters the administration has legal authority to forgive the debt under a law allowing such action during a national emergency such as a pandemic. Earlier Republican U.S. Representative Elise Stefanik had called the plan ""reckless and illegal.""

American university tuition fees are substantially higher than in most other rich countries and U.S. consumers carry $1.75 trillion in student loan debt most of it held by the federal government. Biden said other countries could bypass the United States economically if students are not offered economic relief.

PANDEMIC PAUSE PELL GRANTS

The administration will extend a COVID-19 pandemic-linked pause on student loan repayment to year end while forgiving $10000 in student debt for single borrowers with annual income under $125000 a year or married couples who earn less than $250000 the White House said.

Some 8 million borrowers will be affected automatically the Department of Education said; others need to apply for forgiveness.

The government is also forgiving up to $20000 in debt for some 6 million students from low-income familieswho received federal Pell Grants and proposing a new rule that protects some income from repayment plans and forgives some loan balances after 10 years of repayment the Education Department said.

A New York Federal Reserve study shows that cutting $10000 in federal debt for every student would amount to $321 billion and eliminate the entire balance for 11.8 million borrowers or 31% of them.

INFLATION IMPACT

A senior Biden administration official told reporters the plan could benefit up to 43 million student borrowers completely canceling the debt for some 20 million.

After Dec. 31 the government will resume requiring payment on remaining student loans that were paused during the pandemic. The official said this would offset any inflationary effects of the forgiveness. Payment resumptions could even have a dampening effect on prices the official said.

Former U.S. Treasury secretary Larry Summers disagreed. He said on Twitter that debt relief ""consumes resources that could be better used helping those who did not for whatever reason have the chance to attend college. It will also tend to be inflationary by raising tuitions.""

Similarly Jason Furman a Harvard professor who headed the Council of Economic Advisers during the Obama administration said debt-cancellation would nullify the deflationary powers of the Inflation Reduction Act. ""Pouring roughly half trillion dollars of gasoline on the inflationary fire that is already burning is reckless"" he said.

Moody's analytics chief economist Mark Zandi sided with the White House saying the resumption of billions of dollars per month in student loan payments ""will restrain growth and is disinflationary.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vcG9kY2FzdC90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3dpbGwtaW5kaWEtYmVjb21lLWEtZ2xvYmFsLXBsYXllci1pbi1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLWNoaXBzLTEyMjA4MjUwMDA0MF8xLmh0bWzSAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3Mtc3RhbmRhcmQuY29tL2FtcC9wb2RjYXN0L3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvd2lsbC1pbmRpYS1iZWNvbWUtYS1nbG9iYWwtcGxheWVyLWluLXNlbWljb25kdWN0b3ItY2hpcHMtMTIyMDgyNTAwMDQwXzEuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will India become a global player in semiconductor chips?,"In December last year the government approved a $10 billion package to give a fillip to semiconductor manufacturing in India. This incentive could mark the beginning of India’s latest foray at grabbing a share of the $107 billion global foundry market 64 per cent of which is controlled by a tiny nation -- Taiwan.

So far the scheme has attracted three players. They have already submitted proposals for setting up fab plants in India.

The first is Vedanta along with Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn. The second is ISMC a consortium led by India-based investment firm Next Orbit which has entered a tie-up with Tower Corporation Israel. And the third is Singapore-based IGSS which has IMEC as a partner. The government on its part will provide 50 per cent of the investment cost of setting up a fab plant. Their applications involve a projected investment of $13.6 billion. They have sought support from the Centre to the tune of $5.6 billion.

Tata and Vedanta have also shown intrest in setting up semiconductor plants with foreign partnerships.

But India’s track record is not very encouraging. In 2005 bureaucratic hurdles ended up scuttling the plans of multinationals to set up plants in India. Attempts to attract chipmakers in 2017 and 2020 also failed.

In 2007 Intel moved to China and Vietnam after showing interest in India. In 2013 the government approved two proposals by Jaypee Group and HSMC. It even promised to subsidise the project cost. However the projects were aborted after failing to attract investors.

So when in September 2021 Israel-based chipmaker Tower Semiconductor threatened to pull the plug on its India plan over lack of policy clarity it seemed like history was repeating itself. It had even called for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s intervention. The company is the technology partner of the Next Orbit Ventures-led consortium.

But in May ISMC announced that it had signed an agreement with the Karnataka government to invest $3 billion to set up India’s first and largest semiconductor fab unit in partnership with the same Israeli firm Tower semiconductors.

The current response from these players shows their confidence in the government’s ability to provide adequate infrastructure and incentives. The government is definitely being seen as more welcoming of chipmakers than before. All of this indicates that India's latest foray into the sector is not a false start and might bear fruit.

Unlike in 2005 or 2013 the present situation in India is very different. India imports almost all of its chips. According to an analysis of data from the commerce and industry ministry India's semiconductor imports in 2021-22 increased 65.2 per cent from 2019-20.

The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology estimates that India’s semiconductor market will grow to 63 billion dollars by 2026 from less than $20 billion in 2020. And with the 5G roll-out underway wireless communication will drive the country's semiconductor demand.

So the demand is expected to go up adding to the economic rationale of a domestic chip-making industry.

But will India become a global player in semiconductor chips? Well it will be an uphill task with little guarantee of success since significant challenges remain.

India's $10 billion incentive scheme falls short of competing schemes from countries with larger captive markets. India is not even in the list of top ten in market share of chips. The US has announced an incentive package of $52 billion for chip manufacturing. China will be doling out $150 billion in incentives till 2025. So India might not be able to attract the number of global chip-makers needed to build critical mass.

Enriched with lessons from previous failures the government should move ahead with greater resolve and readiness to make changes wherever necessary. However it will face significant challenges with the environmental impact of the chip-making industry being right at the top.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTA4LTI1L3RveW90YS1ob25kYS10b3AtbGlzdC1vZi1jYXJtYWtlcnMtZmFjaW5nLWNsaW1hdGUtY2hhbmdlLXJpc2tz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Toyota Honda Top List of Carmakers Facing Climate-Change Risks,"Why did this happen?

Morgan BAML and Morgan Stanley pay in the U.S.,"Following a record 2021 Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Morgan Stanley Bank of America and Citi have endured a tougher start to the year as a market downturn has hit deal volumes. In the six months to June 30 the big five posted an average 43% drop in investment banking division revenues.

That will mean lower bonuses for 2022 but all have hiked salaries considerably for junior talent which continues to be in demand. In particular associates have benefitted from a big uplift in pay over the last 18 months.

We’ve compiled the latest average salary data for each of these firms and it reveals some variation. JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs remain the banks to beat in the investment banking league tables but they lag their rivals in terms of pay according to Wall Street Oasis (WSO) the forum website.

Banks don't provide a breakdown of compensation according to seniority but WSO says JPMorgan paid its analysts and vice presidents lower than the rest of the Street. Similarly JPMorgan is near the bottom of the pack when it comes to associate pay.

According to WSO Goldman Sachs is middle of the pack. It pays its analysts an average salary of $92k and its VPs earn $232k less than Bank of America and Morgan Stanley. Its associates earn less than the rest of its big rivals according to WSO. Of course this could be due to a skewed data set.

WSO says Citi pays its analysts an average salary of $96k more than anyone else on the street. It also pays its associates an average of $169k putting it in second place behind Morgan Stanley

Morgan Stanley pays its associates $175k according to WSO. It also looks after its vice presidents (VPs). In previous years the bank was bottom when it came to pay for this cohort but it now pays them an average salary of $274k almost on a par with Bank of America which is the most generous with $275k.

Bank of America paid its new starters the most last year but this year it’s been relegated to second spot by arch-rival Citi according to WSO. It pays its analysts an average salary of $94k and its associates $168k.

Data is hard to come by for managing directors (MDs). However fixed salaries for MDs start at around $500k. The total package of salary plus bonus can be multiples of that once bonuses are included. The size of the bonus depends on a number of things – the total revenue your team brought in as well as your own contribution to the top line...

Although those are the average numbers recruitment and banking sources say a tight labour has pushed base salaries higher than WSO suggests with all five big US banks paying $110k salaries to analysts and $175k to associates. They say that directors at Goldman and Morgan Stanley earn $250k while Bank of America Citi and JPMorgan pay $275k.

Morgan Stanley and Zelis Lease 170000 SF in Morristown

On Aug 24 2022

Onyx Equities’ $50 million capital improvement plan at 340 Mount Kemble in Morristown has paid off with global financial institution Morgan Stanley leasing 116578 square feet and healthcare technology company Zelis leasing 53295 square feet leaving only 22760 square feet remaining to be leased.

Onyx Equities purchased the former AT&T campus in 2016 and began a gut renovation transforming the site into a fully amenitized and modern Class A office building. The redevelopment program included an entirely new glass curtain wall façade windows and roof a completely re-imagined site and landscape plan and a brand-new 25000+ square-foot amenity wing which boasts a commercial-grade fitness center full-service cafeteria conference center game and social lounges and more.

“As we see a shift back to the office we understand the importance of delivering a thoughtful and community-minded work environment that attracts top-tier employee talent and helps to rebuild corporate culture for this new chapter” said John Saraceno Jr. co-founder and managing principal of Onyx Equities. “At 340 Mount Kemble we’ve revolutionized the office experience from the outside-in by adding in-demand amenities modern glass curtain walls individualized HVAC systems and more – all in Morristown one of New Jersey’s most desirable commuter locations.”

In addition to the upgrades at more than $125 per square foot mid-construction—and mid-pandemic—the developer determined the need for newly designed separate HVAC systems for each company. It also continues a partnership with Hackensack Meridian Health System to ensure that it is maintaining operations in the most health-conscious manner possible at 340 Mount Kemble and throughout its portfolio.

Tim Greiner and Blake Goodman from JLL represented Onyx Equities in the transactions Jason Benson and Bob Ryan from JLL represented Morgan Stanley and John Coakley and Dennis Gralla from Cresa represented Zelis.

“Onyx has become known for delivering forward-thinking office environments in prime commuter locations and 340 Mount Kemble is the perfect example of what today’s companies are looking for” said Tim Greiner executive managing director of JLL. “We are thrilled to add to an already impressive tenant roster as we welcome Morgan Stanley and Zelis in 2023.”

The broker Izhar “Izzy” Shefer a 28-year veteran in Aventura Florida who left Morgan Stanley in 2017 and is currently suspended from the industry has filed a motion seeking to vacate the decision by Financial Industry Regulatory Authority arbitrators.

Shefer argues that the arbitrators exceeded their authority in denying his counterclaim with prejudice. The panel was unfairly punishing him for hearing interruptions that were due to “circumstances out of Shefer’s control” including the 68-year-old broker’s “deteriorating health conditions” and his son’s “sudden relapse” according to his court filings.

Morgan Stanley calls the broker’s motion “frivolous” and says he has “lawyered up” in effort to skirt his contractual obligations according to a response to his motion to vacate. It amounts to “little more than weak attempts to obtain some offset on a debt” the firm’s lawyers argued.

“There can be no doubt that Mr. Shefer–a longtime financial advisor–well understood the consequences of his execution of the promissory notes and the substantial debt he would owe to Morgan Stanley” the firm wrote in the response.

Brokers face an uphill battle in fighting note cases where employment contracts clearly spell out that the unvested portion of hiring bonuses or deferred compensation must be repaid lawyers have said. Courts also rarely overturn awards given the limited grounds provided by the Federal Arbitration Act.

With the April award a three-member panel—with two public and one nonpublic arbitrator—awarded Morgan Stanley $767367 plus 2.5% interest per year with accrual beginning in 2017 and $175000 in attorneys’ fees.

“The Panel finds it is highly improbable he would have prevailed on his Counterclaim under the best of circumstances” they noted. The arbitrators also cited the broker’s lawyer for disregarding orders before and during hearings and “unpredictable actions.”

In June Finra suspended Shefer based on allegations that he failed to comply with an arbitration award.

In his counterclaim Shefer had accused Morgan Stanley of defamation constructive discharge whistleblower retaliation a reckless internal investigation and unjust enrichment. Both the claim for $13.7 million in damages and expungement were denied.

Shefer said he had been generating around $500000 in annual revenue when he joined Morgan Stanley in 2011 and had grown his practice to $1.3 million by 2015.

Problems began to arise in 2014 when Morgan Stanley asked him to “partner up” with a new advisor who turned out to be “a compliance mess” and was fired in 2016 according to Shefer’s motion. The discharged younger broker filed his own wrongful termination claim against Morgan Stanley leading to regulatory investigations of Shefer and the firm the same motion alleges.

At that point “Morgan Stanley began its efforts to force Mr. Shefer out—making it next to impossible to perform his job and keep his clients happy” the motion alleges. The firm took three months to approve “basic transactional documentation” and triggered “red flags” on trading strategies Shefer had used for years prior all having “a drastic effect” on his client relationships it alleges.

Morgan Stanley tried to “switch the blame” for the younger fired financial advisors’ actions onto Shefer according to Nera Shefer his wife and his lawyer who represented him at the underlying arbitration and continues to represent in federal court.

Shefer’s BrokerCheck record includes six claims filed by clients between 2016 and 2018 which have led to settlements of more than $370000 combined. In his comments on one Shefer denies the allegations and notes: “The claim was settled while I was no longer associated with the firm.”

For its part Morgan Stanley notes that it settled claims to “avoid the costs and uncertainties of litigation.”

After leaving Morgan Stanley Shefer registered with Aurora Private Wealth in Aventura. He has not been registered as a broker or investment advisor since his affiliation with APW lapsed in 2019 according to licensing records.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vcnZidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vbW9yZ2FuLXN0YW5sZXlzLWJyYWQtc3RhbmVrLW5vdy1taWdodC1iZS10aGUtdGltZS10by1leGl0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Morgan Stanley's Brad Stanek: Now Might Be the Time to Exit,"EDITOR’S NOTE: The following is a guest column by Brad Stanek CFP a Senior Vice President of The Stanek Group at Morgan Stanley in Chicago.

Despite higher gas prices inflation rising interest rates and recession fears multiples for successful RV dealerships remain historically high. Although the RV industry still faces a lot of buy-sell activity buyers are becoming pickier about who they pursue and the terms they offer since they have a lot more good dealerships to choose from. With many sensing a top of the market dealers have been asking me if they should pull the trigger now before multiples (and offers) diminish.

As with so many things in life it depends. Multiples aside if you’re not emotionally ready to sell if you haven’t thought through the next chapter of your life and if you don’t have your financials and other key documents in order you’re not likely to have a successful outcome.

What’s your dealership worth?

First you must be realistic about what your business is worth to an experienced buyer. Buyers value a business based on the cash flow it generates. Typically that’s based on a multiple of EBIDTA which is a proxy for cash flow.

Recent values have been in the 4-5x EBITDA range meaning that if you have $1 million of EBITDA a buyer will pay $4 million to $5 million for that stream of cash. Most buyers will try to “normalize” a seller’s EBITDA to determine the value of the business under normal times – not COVID times. Since values have been inching up since the pandemic buyers have become increasingly selective.

But it’s not all about your financial statements. Here are six other important considerations:

1. Facilities. Personally I’ve found many buyers look for dealerships with attractive and well-maintained facilities which can have a significant impact on the customer experience.

2. Real Estate. Real estate typically accounts for half of a dealership’s value. Jesse Stopnitzky partner and director of the RV Division for Performance Brokerage Services told me recently that although many buyers prefer to own the real estate outright some of the larger dealer groups prefer to lease preserving the capital for additional acquisitions. He said you need to consider how much acreage is required the square feet of facility space and how many service bays are needed. You also should consider whether any capital expenditure investment is required for remodeling and the physical location of the dealership. Is it off the beaten path or is it near the interstate with visibility?

3. Inventory. This is another important component of your dealership’s value. Buyers pay dealers on their inventory equity i.e. the inventory value minus the floor plan owed.

4. Lines. Having worked with RV dealers for many years I’ve found that the lines a dealer carries matter a great deal to buyers. For instance are they great lines or are you in an area where a buyer can pull some of their own lines into your location because there’s a territory gap? Also how much land do you have? If you are on three acres and bursting at the seams the buyer is not going to be able to turn your inventory any faster than you did. As a result they’ll feel the revenue potential of your location is capped and that could diminish the offer price.

5. Staffing. Like so many retail businesses today dealerships are having a hard time finding good employees. If you have a great management team that can run the dealership smoothly in your absence that’s a huge confidence builder for potential buyers. However if the management team isn’t strong or if it’s too dependent on the owner then the dealership becomes less attractive to buyers everything else being equal.

6. Room to Grow. Savvy buyers look for strong markets strong brands good facilities and good locations. Finally they look for room to grow. That’s one way buyers can enhance value. They may pay a little more if they think there’s an opportunity to grow their business after you leave. Since many are looking for growing markets Stopnitzky said buyers are also looking at the strength of the market in which a dealership operates as well as the dealer’s reputation within the market.

Whether you’re growing your business for the long-term planning to transfer it or intending to leave it within the family you only get one chance to get it right. It may be worth getting a second opinion from experts who focus on RV dealership transactions and ownership transitions.At a bare minimum a second opinion should tell you:

Where you are today personally financially and business-wise.

Where you want to go.

Gaps that need to be filled to get you to your destination.

How to bridge those gaps.

Time cost and expertise needed to bridge those gaps.

Conclusion

Numbers ratios and multiples aside the only “right” time to sell is when it’s the right time for you and your family. That means getting your ducks in a row several years before your planned exit. It also means being crystal clear about how much “walkaway” money you need to have to support your lifestyle post-exit and knowing how you will spend your time when you’re no longer running day-to-day operations.

An American investment company that aims to “disrupt the live entertainment industry” has purchased the management group overseeing Mosaic Place and could offer more expertise resources and guidance with venue operations.

In November 2021 Los Angeles Calif.-based Oak View Group acquired Florida-based Spectra Venue Management Services and brought it under the company’s OVG Facilities division. The company re-branded that division in early 2022 under the OVG360 banner and now plans to offer services focused on driving value for clients in every aspect of the business.

The information about the purchase was contained in the 2021 Mosaic Place annual report that Spectra presented during the Aug. 22 regular city council meeting.

Ryan MacIvor Spectra general manager told the Express that this acquisition is “very positive” and “no major changes” would occur with how Mosaic Place — now the Events Centre or Multiplex — is managed. The only adjustments that have occurred he laughed are the replacement of numerous Spectra logos throughout the building.

OVG360 is designed to offer expertise resources and guidance with venue operations such as hospitality and food services booking and content development private events global partnerships premium sales and integrated marketing solutions a news release said.

Furthermore this division also focuses on public safety public health and sanitization sustainable operations parking and mobility services customer service training procurement support project management services and retail development.

“Now that OVG’s acquisition of Spectra is complete we can get down to the business of delivering an expanded highly competitive set of services that anticipate and meet the evolving needs of our global client base” Tim Leiweke CEO of OVG said in a news release.

“We’ll begin the important process of fully integrating the talented team at Spectra and bringing together our two organizations to create something truly extraordinary in the live events and entertainment industry.”

“Venues are incredible community assets the very last town square perhaps the remaining place where diverse people gather to laugh to cheer to sing to dance to dine to conduct business to protest or to vote en masse” said Chris Granger CEO of OVG360. “As the needs and uses of these venues continue to evolve we will be there with our clients leading the way.

“We will … provide our fans and our clients with extraordinary service indelible memories and easy confidence in knowing that we can again and forever gather safely.”

Founded in 2015 OVG specializes in real estate venue development and financing sponsorship sales and partnership management media and content and buildings management and security the news release said.

Furthermore OVG has partnerships with prominent venues including major league ballparks. It is also planning to build a $3-billion sports and entertainment district in Las Vegas including a 20000-seat NBA stadium.

Mosaic Place’s future outlook

The pandemic’s effects will continue to create new challenges and problems for the live event industry in 2023 MacIvor said in the annual report. Venue staff did a great job in 2021 navigating the ever-changing provincial COVID-19 protocols and health orders while pushing ahead with plans to re-open the building.

“… we are confident that over the next 12 months we will see improvement over this past calendar year and we predict that over the next 12 to 18 months following conversations that we have had with concert promoters and event partners that more and more events will return” he continued.

Spectra continues to focus on working with the building’s tenants and community to provide a clean and safe world-class sports and entertainment venue while offering exceptional customer service and products MacIvor added. The company’s goal is to provide something for everyone whether it’s sports concerts or family and/or community events.

Gough has nearly 30 years of international natural resources experience serving most recently as Mosaic’s senior vice-president and chief commercial officer and before that within the mining sector at Coalspur and in progressively senior leadership positions at BHP.

“The board is pleased to welcome Rob as Mosaic’s next president and CEO. Rob is a successful leader and people manager and has a proven track record in business development value creation and change management. He played an instrumental role in the creation of Mosaic Canada’s largest privately-owned timberlands producer through the affiliation of TimberWest and Island Timberlands” said Jake Kerr chair of the board.

“It is truly an honour to lead Mosaic with its long and proud history of more than a century” said Gough. “Now is a time of great opportunity to build an even stronger future for Mosaic with our relentless focus on safety and sustainable forest management while growing strong customer relationships and First Nations partnerships with our team of deeply talented and dedicated employees and contractors.”

Gough succeeds president and CEO Jeff Zweig who is leaving the company effective August 31 in a previously announced planned departure. Mr. Zweig will work with Mr. Gough on an effective transition.

“On behalf of the board I want to thank Jeff for his leadership and significant contributions in his seven-plus years with the company” added Kerr. “Under his leadership Jeff led the creation of Mosaic and helped drive substantial improvements in safety sustainability and financial performance.”

Under Zweig’s leadership Mosaic was the first forest company in B.C. to have its Progressive Aboriginal Relations program certified. It was the first forest company globally to certify its organizational carbon footprint. It recently launched the largest nature-based carbon credit project in Canada. During his tenure Mosaic made significant progress on diversity equity and inclusion and was recognized as one of B.C.’s top employers for 2022.

“I am proud to have been part of the creation and growth of Mosaic a world-class timberlands company” Zweig said. “Rob has the background and experience to lead Mosaic forward and execute the initiatives necessary to continue responsibly advancing the company as a leader in sustainable timberland management.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL2RlbnZlcml0ZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8yNC95b3V2ZS1zZWVuLWhpcy1tb3NhaWMtYXJ0d29yay1pbi1kZW52ZXItdGhlLWxhdGUtYm9iLWx1bmFzLWZpbmFsLXByb2plY3Qtbm93LWxpdmVzLWF0LXRoZS10YXR0ZXJlZC1jb3Zlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,You've seen his mosaic artwork in Denver -- the late Bob Luna's final project now lives at the Tattered Cover,"In the Denver art scene Bob Luna was a staple. He was a staple of Denver in general but through art he left his mark. A few of his pieces live around town including his co-creation with Martha Keating a 10-panel mosaic mural in Highland on the retaining wall separating Interstate 25 from Kalamath Street titled ""Neighborhood Epic.""

Bob was his own community hub gathering people to him like a magnet full of art and togetherness. That's how his sister Susan and his friend Theresa Marten describe him.

""Bob was a character"" Susan Luna laughed. ""He was ornery. He was a contrarian. He was very caring. A good teacher mentor a good friend. He was a mountaineer. He had hard times struggled with alcoholism but the last 10 years of his life he was sober. He was always out for the little guy and through art he wanted social justice.""

Marten nodded laughed and snorted as Luna described her big brother. Marten can't recall the first time she met Bob. He was just there. There being SAME Cafe on East Colfax. SAME is a donation-based eatery. In exchange for a meal you can donate your time money or produce. Marten is the Cafe director and Bob was a frequent visitor.

""I have genuine conversations with anyone that comes in and they are all different levels of that but Bob cut right to the meat of it"" Marten said. ""We started having deep conversations.... He would ask me really intense questions about our business model.... I don't know how he found out I was Catholic but then he started giving me Catholic quizzes.""

""Sounds like Bob"" Luna said.

Bob died unexpectedly in July 2021. He was 65 years old.

But before his death he and Marten were working on an art project -- a mural depicting what they and many others bonded with Bob over: community. Specifically the SAME Cafe community the Colfax community and life in Colorado.

On Tuesday Luna Marten and others Bob Luna had touched and taught celebrated the installation of the project at the Tattered Cover on Colfax.

""This project started at SAME Cafe and it started with me bringing Bob his lunch"" Marten said. ""We wanted to show what community at SAME Cafe looks like... but also tell the story of Colfax and Colorado.""

Marten said the idea of the mural came from one of her long talks with Bob at the Cafe.

It was around October or November of 2020 and it centered on the pandemic. Uncertainty chaos and loneliness were in the air and Marten said SAME Cafe wasn't able to be the community-filled place it was when people could get close to each other.

""Before COVID people would hang out here all day"" Marten said. ""I revealed to Bob that it was really difficult seeing our community change the way it had.... We saw a lot of people not do well financially.

""They had health concerns a lot of anxiety and just overall the change of consistency to unpredictability. I wanted to find a way to respond to that that could bring us back to community"" she said. ""Bob's response was immediately art.""

The pair hatched a plan to create a mural with the help of community members. Using the ""Neighborhood Epic"" as inspiration the plan was to hand out small square canvases so folks could paint what was important to them. Those squares would border Bob's work which focused on the Cafe Colfax and Colorado. Marten and Bob chose SAME as the center because it was the center of their story but also a centerpiece on Colfax.

At the time the Cafe was celebrating its 15th anniversary at the same location. Marten said Colfax was important to the mural because of its rich history. Colfax was just as unique as the Cafe in that you never know who could walk in or walk down the block but in between the strangers are regulars like Bob and Marten.

Susan Luna added that the family grew up in Cap Hill and attended East High School.

""Denver's changed a lot"" Luna said. ""There's been a lot of displacement. But you can go to Colfax and you can still feel like OK this is Denver.""

Bob started sketching some things out and other artists and community organizations jumped on like Carlos Sandoval who had worked with Bob in the past. Sandoval and Bob were going to teach the community members about painting and scaling and the Cafe would hold community art days to get the work done.

But Bob passed away and the project was put to the side.

That was until Marten met Luna and Dr. Renee Fajardo Chair of the Chicano Humanities and Arts Council. They connected at a celebration of life party for Bob and Fajardo wanted to help continue the project. She and Bob knew each other through CHAC and beyond with Bob having taught Farjardo's children art at the La Alma Recreation Center.

Artist Tommy Nahulu speaks about Bob Luna an old friend as ""Bob Luna's Colfax"" is unveiled at its new home in the Tattered Cover's Colfax location. Aug. 24 2022.

Luna was also interested in continuing the project so she and Fajardo brought on more artists funding and partners including students at East and another Denver muralist Tommy Nahulu.

""Bob always showed up"" Fajardo said. ""You didn't have to ask him it was just there in his heart. He was my compadre. Bob was my partner in art projects and school projects.... It was my honor in this life to walk with him.""

Earlier this year the project was finished. It hung in SAME for a small amount of time but Marten and Luna knew it needed to go in a different space. They called around and eventually asked Councilmembers Candi CdeBaca and Jamie Torres if they had any ideas. CdeBaca's office connected the two with Kwame Spearman CEO of Tattered Cover. Luna got the call that the mural would be placed in the bookstore a day after the one-year anniversary of Bob Luna's death.

Luna said Bob and the family are no strangers to Tattered Cover having shopped there for years so the bookstore was the perfect place for the project. It sits above the young adult section looking like it was commissioned for the single place.

On Tuesday Marten explained what each section of the mural means. The middle portion is a copy of Bob's first rendering deciphered by Nahulu. There's SAME Cafe along Colfax images of some regulars the Capitol building Colorado landscape and a field of crops. In the center is Bob blowing bubbles. Along the edges are the square canvases locals painted along with bigger pictures from East students Colorado Artists in Recovery and the La Alma Mujeres Artistas Sisterhood.

At the top is the title ""Bob Luna's Colfax.""

Marten and Luna both agreed they feel relieved now that the mural is done and has a home. For them it was part of their grieving process and now they can celebrate.

""I've gone from 'BOB YOU LEFT ME TO THIS PROJECT' to 'Thank you you left me with this project'"" Luna said. ""Bob had a hand in the project the whole way. You could feel it. Like a puppet master. It was a labor of love and it was bigger than ourselves and for me it felt like we really needed something like that.""

Marten added ""It's hard to grieve people.... It's weird because we're not really supposed to know each other that well. You know I provide a service.... It took me a while to realize yeah I really miss Bob. Now I just want to celebrate. I'm really glad it's at the Tattered Cover and I'm hoping folks get to see the scope of the project and get to know a little about SAME and Bob.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zcGFidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vd2VsbG5lc3MtcHJvZHVjdHMtYW5kLXNlcnZpY2VzL0FydC1hbmQtc3BhLWNvbGxpZGUtYXMtU29sZXVtLVNwYS1hbmQtU0lDSVMtbGF1bmNoLWhhbmQtc2V0LW1vc2FpYy1zcGEtcG9kcy8zNDk5ODLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Art and spa collide as Soleum Spa and SICIS launch hand-set mosaic spa pods | spabusiness.com products,"PRODUCT NEWS

BAE Systems said it has been awarded a contract valued at US$278M to supply 110 vehicles as well as spare parts and logistical support. Deliveries are slated for completion by 2029.

BAE Systems stated that the BEOWULF successfully completed the prototype evaluation phase of the CATV programme in Alaska earlier this year. The company added that the BEOWULF had already completed several trial missions and remained fully operational. The tests included:

amphibious operations

navigating terrain of varying complexity

operating in extreme cold

soldier evaluation

The BRONCO 3 offered by Oshkosh/ST Engineering had also participated in the evaluation phase but was not included in the delivery order.

BEOWULF Details

The BEOWULF is based on the armoured BvS 10 despite being unarmoured itself and will be the successor to the BvS 206 in US Army service. The articulated vehicle consists of two segments each driven by a pair of tracks with steering performed via an articulated joint that connects both segments. The vehicle is by a 210 kW Cummins Diesel engine allowing speeds of up to 70 km/h on land. Thanks to the low ground pressure and the tracked drive the BEOWULF can move over swampy terrain. The vehicle is also amphibious without preparation and is propelled in water via the tracks to a maximum swim speed of 4 km/h.

With a total weight of 15.5 tonnes up to 3 tonnes of payload can be carried in the front segment (which houses the propulsion system) and up to 5 tonnes in the rear segment. When configured as a personnel carrier the vehicle has space for up to 14 personnel including crew.

BAE Systems stated that the BEOWULF is being built by BAE Systems Hägglunds in northern Sweden and includes several key components from US suppliers such as:

the engine

transmission

hydraulic system

Several European countries including Germany the UK the Netherlands and Sweden have launched a similarly-titled joint programme known as Collaborative All-Terrain Vehicle with similar requirements to the US Army’s CATV programme. The Bundeswehr requirement is for 140 vehicles valued at approximately €276m. An initial €25M funding request for this programme is expected later in 2022.

The main detractors were value outperformance as well as lower allocations to energy and aerospace and defense. Higher than average MSCI ESG Ratings carbon efficiency and low-risk allocations were positive contributors.

The MSCI ACWI ESG Indexes have historically outperformed the MSCI ACWI Index. These indexes are designed to have enhanced MSCI ESG Ratings and in some cases values-based alignment.

As investors seek to build ESG solutions there is a continued emphasis on ESG mindfulness. And with different ESG solutions comes varied levels of risk and return including the impact of unexpected events such as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. Since the ESG investment environment is perpetually evolving investors may want to focus on key attributes and metrics that are of particular interest and manage portfolios accordingly.

Financial-market geopolitical and macroeconomic risks rose in the first half of 2022. We found that the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war on Feb. 24 presented two separate stories that explained the performance of the five MSCI ACWI ESG Indexes.

As shown below in the “buildup period” the weeks before the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war (Jan. 1 to Feb. 23) higher oil and gas prices and a macroeconomic environment that was conducive to inexpensive stocks led to a decline in the performance of the MSCI ACWI ESG Indexes. We also highlight the ""war-continuation"" period which was a relatively less volatile interval.

Active factor-return attribution for the MSCI ACWI ESG Indexes during buildup and war-continuation periods of Russia-Ukraine war. Dec. 31 2021 to July 29 2022.

Energy stocks experienced high returns particularly at the beginning of this year when oil prices spiked and the economy was recovering from the pandemic lockdowns. Similarly aerospace and defense stocks started the year on a positive note helped by expectations of higher demand of defense equipment related to the Russia-Ukraine war. While the five MSCI ACWI ESG Indexes were constructed to avoid large active allocations in sectors small active sector exposures during shorter and turbulent periods can lead to significant return contributions. And while energy and aerospace and defense have had low active allocations in the MSCI ESG Indexes this year which reflects the values and integration alignment of these indexes their active-performance contribution has been substantially negative due to strong returns in those sectors.

First-half drags on performance

We previously asserted that high-ESG-rated companies have tended to be associated with expensive stocks lower idiosyncratic volatility and lower systematic risk. Thus the lack of a value allocation played an important role in the underperformance of MSCI ACWI ESG Indexes and was a significant headwind during the buildup period of the war. Throughout the war-continuation period when gas shortages in Europe started to emerge an overweight of carbon-efficient stocks within each sector had a positive effect on the performance of the ESG Indexes. Companies with a higher-than-average MSCI ESG Rating and low-risk stocks also played a significantly role in the recovery of the MSCI ACWI SRI Index and lessened the underperformance of the other MSCI ACWI ESG Indexes.1

ESG ratings goal attainment

The MSCI ACWI ESG Screened Index incorporates values-based exclusions with a pro-rata reallocation of capital to the remaining stocks. The other ESG indexes use MSCI ESG Ratings for security selection and allocation and are expected to show a significant improvement in ESG score over the parent index (as shown below). The MSCI ACWI ESG Screened Index doesn’t use MSCI ESG Ratings so it usually has a similar aggregated ESG score as the parent index. The other four MSCI ACWI ESG Indexes had a higher MSCI ESG score over their parent during this period of study which is in line with the main objective of these indexes. We also saw an improvement of each of the ESG pillar scores for these four MSCI ACWI ESG Indexes.

First-half performance and ESG efficacy

The five flagship MSCI ACWI ESG Indexes were adversely impacted by the rally in energy and defense stocks as well as the outperformance of cheaper companies during the buildup to the Russia-Ukraine war. However the performance of high ESG-rated carbon-efficient and low-risk stocks during the war-continuation period helped bolster performance.

We show how a hypothetical portfolio of stocks with high (positive) inflation sensitivity would have outperformed the broad market during the recent inflation spike.

Regardless of an investors’ views on inflation they can use stock-level sensitivity as they determine whether and how to position portfolios.

While the high-inflation environment and its impact on asset prices are on most investors’ minds some investors may also be contemplating whether inflation has peaked following the swift action by global central banks. As shown below the five-year breakeven-inflation rate has dropped from its high of 3.6% in March to 2.7%.

In our previous blog post we discussed how stock-level inflation sensitivity can be used to assess a portfolio’s sensitivity to inflation. Using data from MKT MediaStats1 we looked at the inflation sensitivity of various MSCI USA sector and factor indexes and their variation over time.

In this blog post we investigate the potential of using the stock-level inflation sensitivity to construct hypothetical portfolios aligned with investors’ views on inflation. These views may range from “inflation is here to stay and could rise from the current level” to “it has peaked and we could see a drop in inflation from here.”

Measuring stock-level inflation sensitivity

The estimates of stock-level inflation sensitivity are calculated by regressing stock returns on several macro signals such as breakeven inflation and oil and gold prices while incorporating inflation sentiment derived from news articles. The final sensitivity is calculated as a score ranging from 1 to 10 with 10 representing stocks that have historically shown the best performance in response to higher inflation. The use of sentiment in the calculation aims to capture the stock-price behavior not only to inflation itself but to investors’ views and expectations of inflation. We show the distribution of scores for the constituents of the MSCI USA Index below.

Building an inflation-aware portfolio

We use these inflation sensitivities to create hypothetical portfolios with a positive (or negative) sensitivity to inflation. To view the behavior of these portfolios on a historical basis we created two sample portfolios of 100 stocks from the constituents of the MSCI USA Index. The Top100 portfolio includes stocks with the highest inflation sensitivities and the Bottom100 portfolio comprises stocks with the lowest sensitivity. Stocks in each portfolio are also given weights proportional to their weight in the MSCI USA Index. The portfolios are rebalanced quarterly.

Below we detail the performance of these two portfolios relative to the MSCI USA Index. During the inflation rise of the recent past the Top100 portfolio moved in tandem with inflation and the U.S. consumer price index.2 Over this period the Bottom100 portfolio showed negative active return although most of its underperformance is due to the past seven months. During the period of relatively muted inflation from 2012 to 2020 the two portfolios don’t show significant inflation-related behavior.

Inflation-sensitive portfolios through changes in US inflation

We show below the two inflation-sensitive portfolios’ active exposures to different sectors. While the exposures varied over time sectors such as energy and industrials were mostly overweight in the Top100 portfolio and underweight in the Bottom100 portfolio. Exposure to the health-care sector was primarily negative and positive in the Top100 and Bottom100 portfolios respectively over time. However the current Top100 and Bottom100 portfolios are overweight and underweight this sector. One reason behind changes in sector exposure is that our analysis began in 2012 which encompasses a long period of low inflation. The recent rise in inflation has pushed these hypothetical portfolios’ exposures to some sectors to historical extremes.

Addressing the inflation challenge

Stock-level inflation sensitivity can help investors assess a portfolio’s exposure to inflation but it can also provide information as they determine whether to adjust or construct their portfolio based on their view on inflation. We showed how simple hypothetical portfolios constructed using stock-level inflation sensitivity have responded to the recent hike in inflation. The sector analysis showed while these portfolios show overweight and underweight to different sectors they had a relatively balanced representations from all sectors. This is in line with our previous observation where we saw variation in inflation sensitivity within each sector.

They do so by sifting masses of data to extract insights into various elements of environmental social and governance performance and risk. Investors rely on this information to make investment decisions while corporations use ratings to gain third-party feedback on the quality of their sustainability initiatives.

Recently ESG ratings providers have come under scrutiny over concerns of the reliability of their assessments. In this post we examine these concerns. We review the demand for ESG information the stated objectives of ESG ratings providers how ratings are determined the evidence of what they achieve and structural aspects of the industry that potentially influence ratings. Our purpose is to help companies investors and regulators better understand the use of ESG ratings and to highlight areas where they can improve. We find that while ESG ratings providers may convey important insights into the nonfinancial impact of companies significant shortcomings exist in their objectives methodologies and incentives which detract from the informativeness of their assessments.

Demand for ESG Information

Demand for ESG information has exploded in recent years. Ten years ago the term ESG—although in existence—was rarely used by the investment community or in corporate boardrooms. Instead public and professional interest was focused on the general concepts of corporate responsibility sustainability and impact investing. Only recently has the focus on ESG (environmental social and governance) as a unique concept come to the forefront and with it an explosion in the demand for information (see Exhibit 1).

Sources of this demand include:

Asset owners . Investors concerned about the environmental and societal impact of the companies they invest in. These individuals generally do not want to invest in companies whose products (because of their sourcing production end use or disposal) cause harm to society or otherwise represent practices deemed contrary to their personal values. These individuals use information on companies or funds as an ESG screen for their investments.

These individuals generally do not want to invest in companies whose products (because of their sourcing production end use or disposal) cause harm to society or otherwise represent practices deemed contrary to their personal values. These individuals use information on companies or funds as an ESG screen for their investments. Institutional investors . Institutional investors seek information about the environmental and societal performance of companies to create investment products and services to meet the needs of their clients. Additionally some institutional investors have a view on the financial impact that societal and environmental forces can have on the short- and long-term performance of companies. Examples include passive funds (such as BlackRock Vanguard and StateStreet) who have increased their advocacy for environmental or social issues. They also include active managers (such as Parnassus Investments and Calvert Investments) who believe that mitigating ESG factors will improve the risk and performance characteristics of their fund. These funds seek information about the performance of specific companies along various dimensions of ESG and the potential risk that ESG factors pose to business.

Companies want to demonstrate the extent to which they invest in stakeholder-facing initiatives and highlight their positive impact. On one hand companies are a primary supplier of ESG information through voluntary disclosure such as sustainability reports. These are used to highlight activities the company engages in and possibly counter public criticism of the alleged harm of their activities. On the other hand companies also are consumers of third-party ESG information which they use to validate their claims of positive impact.

Regulators who are concerned that ESG information might be material to the financial performance of corporations particularly human capital management practices and environmental impact. Also regulators who assess investment managers’ claims about their incorporation of ESG-factors in the investment process.

Also regulators who assess investment managers’ claims about their incorporation of ESG-factors in the investment process. Other stakeholders. Stakeholders who are not direct beneficiaries or contributors to assets yet have an opinion about how those assets are invested such as students concerned about a university endowment consultants advising on the investment process or local governments interested in pension assets.

Demand for ESG information has in many ways outstripped the ability of suppliers to supply the depth detail and accuracy of data required. This is perhaps due to the immense number of factors that plausibly fall under the heading of ESG the difficulty in measuring ESG factors and the daunting challenge of determining their impact. To this end Amel-Zadeh and Serafeim (2018) find several informational impediments that hinder ESG integration in the investment process including lack of comparability across firms lack of standards the cost of gathering information and a lack of quantifiable information.

Commercially developed third-party ESG ratings are one type of service provider that has evolved to meet the demand for ESG information. A 2020 survey by SustainAbility finds that ESG ratings are the most frequently referenced source of information that institutional investors rely on to gauge ESG performance (55 percent tied with direct company engagement). Another survey finds that 88 percent of investment professionals use third-party ESG ratings as a part of their investment process with 92 percent expecting to do so in the future.

The importance of ESG ratings to the asset management business is demonstrated by the flow of funds into ESG-labeled investment products. Bank of America calculates that over $200 billion was invested in ESG bond funds between 2019 and 2022. Hartzmark and Sussman (2019) show that mutual funds with high ESG ratings (as measured by Morningtart) realized net inflows over the measurement period compared with net outflows among firms with low ESG ratings.

What Are ESG Ratings Supposed to Measure?

ESG ratings are intended to measure “ESG quality.” ESG quality itself however does not have a single agreed-upon definition. Two main views of ESG exist and to some extent they work in directionally opposite ways.

One view of ESG is that it reflects the impact a company has on the welfare of its stakeholders such as employees suppliers customers local community and the environment. Under this definition a company can improve its ESG profile by withdrawing from activities that are harmful to stakeholders or improving business practices in affected areas to benefit these constituents. The cost of such investment at least in the short run is incurred by shareholders while the long-term financial impact to the company is undetermined or unstated. This view of ESG (“doing good”) is what most individual investors likely think of when they think about ESG quality.

A competing view is that ESG measures the impact societal and environmental factors have on the company and that these factors are financially material. Under this definition an ESG framework provides a set of risk factors that the company can plan for or mitigate through strategic planning targeted investment or a change in operating activity. Addressing ESG risk factors even if costly in the short run is expected to result in a long-term financial benefit to the corporation and its shareholders. This view of ESG (the impact of environmental and social risks on financial performance) is the one predominantly adopted by ESG ratings providers.

The tension between these viewpoints is demonstrated in a Bloomberg BusinessWeek article which takes a critical view of ESG ratings with a focus on the ratings of MSCI. According to the article

There’s virtually no connection between MSCI’s ‘better world’ marketing and its methodology. That’s because the ratings don’t measure a company’s impact on the Earth and society. In fact they gauge the opposite: the potential impact of the world on the company and its shareholders. MSCI doesn’t dispute this characterization. It defends its methodology as the most financially relevant for the companies it rates.

According to the article MSCI’s CEO

concedes ordinary investors piling into such funds have no idea that his ratings and ESG overall gauge the risk the world poses to a company not the other way around. ‘No they for sure don’t understand that’ he said in an interview.

The authors of this piece make the assumption that ESG ratings are supposed to measure a company’s impact on the environment and society and convey surprise that MSCI’s ratings attempt to measure the opposite.

Who Are The Players?

The ESG ratings industry is highly fragmented with dozens of ratings agencies and data providers in existence. The backgrounds of these firms are not uniform with many having entered the ESG ratings business from different areas of historical expertise. Some ESG ratings firms used to create ESG funds or referenced in the press include:

MSCI. MSCI publishes ESG ratings on 8500 companies (14000 issuers) globally and employs over 200 analysts. The data from MSCI ESG research analysts are also used to produce MSCI ESG Indexes. MSCI was originally a subsidiary of Morgan Stanley (MSCI stands for Morgan Stanley Capital Investment) and its primary business is the compilation of stock-market indexes for license to investment management firms. In 2007 Morgan Stanley spun off MSCI as a separately traded public company. In 2010 MSCI acquired RiskMetrics which owned KLD one of the earliest providers of sustainability data in the U.S. In 2014 MSCI purchased GMI Ratings a provider of governance and accounting quality ratings. In 2019 MSCI acquired a climate-change analytics company called Carbon Delta.

ISS ESG. ISS ESG publishes ratings on 11800 issuers and 25000 funds. ISS ESG is a subsidiary of Institutional Shareholder Services the largest proxy advisory firm that provides recommendations to investment management firms on how to vote various items on the annual proxy. ISS has historically provided governance ratings and offers consulting services to companies on how they can improve governance quality. In 2014 MSCI sold ISS (which it had acquired through RiskMetrics) to a private-equity firm. In 2017 ISS was sold to another private-equity firm. In 2020 Deutsche Börse acquired majority ownership (80 percent) of ISS.

Sustainalytics. Sustainalytics publishes ESG ratings on over 13000 companies and employs 200 analysts. Sustainalytics is owned by Morningstar (acquired in 2020) whose primary business is the rating of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds for use by individual investors. Morningstar uses Sustainalytics ratings to provide sustainability ratings to the funds its rates. Funds are awarded “globes” with a high number of globes indicating lower ESG risk.

Refinitiv. Refinitiv calculates ESG scores on 11800 companies and has 700 research analysts. Refinitiv is the rebranded data provider ThomsonReuters which owns the namesake database as well as newswire Reuters. Refinitiv was purchased by the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) in 2021. Refinitiv ESG scores are included for purchase through the company’s broader financial databases.

FTSE Russell. FTSE Russell publishes ratings on 7200 securities. FTSE Russell’s main business is the compilation of market indexes which like MSCI it licenses to investment management firms. FTSE Russell is also owned by the London Stock Exchange Group which purchased Russell Indexes in 2015 and combined them with the FTSE Indexes which it already owned and had jointly developed with the Financial Times. LSEG sells FTSE Russell ESG ratings to investment managers for use in individual security selection and also uses them to create customer benchmarks for mutual funds and exchange-traded funds.

These are just a few ESG ratings providers. Other well-known firms include S&P Global Vigeo Eiris (owned by Moody’s Investor Services) HIP and TruValue Labs (owned by FactSet Research—See Exhibit 2).

What Do They Say They Measure?

ESG ratings firms aim to provide insight into ESG quality. However the approaches they take are not the same. This can be seen in the variation in their stated objectives.

A common theme among ESG providers is investment risk reduction. The assumption is that ESG quality improves financial performance by reducing social and environmental factors that pose risk to the company’s business model or operations. To this end MSCI claims its ratings “support ESG risk mitigation and long-term value creation.” Sustainalytics measures “the degree to which a company’s economic value is at risk” because of ESG factors. If these providers are correct in their thesis and accurate in their measurement we should be able to observe a correlation between ESG ratings and subsequent risk events (measured by such factors as financial performance or reduced likelihood of regulatory violations litigation or bankruptcy.

Risk reduction is not the only claim of ESG ratings providers. Some are explicit in designing their scores to predict returns. For example HIP claims that its ratings “correlate with better returns for the same amount of risk.” Arabesque says its approach “is all about identifying companies that are better positioned to outperform over the long term. … When calculating the ESG score of a company the algorithm will only use information that significantly helps explain future risk-adjusted performance.” These claims are also testable and can be verified by relating ESG ratings to subsequent stock or bond price changes.

In addition to these some ESG ratings providers make additional claims such as measuring a company’s environmental or social impact (ISS) transparency and commitment to ESG (Refinitiv) or provide a screen for ESG selection in support of stewardship goals (FTSE Russell). The accuracy of these types of claims is somewhat harder to measure.

ESG ratings are generally reported on a letter or numeric basis to reflect the company’s absolute or relative ESG risk or performance. Some companies (such as MSCI) use a 7-point scale from AAA to CCC analogous to that used by major credit-rating agencies. Others use a 12-point scale from A+ to D- similar to an education system (ISS is an example). Another widely used approach is to publish scores on a percentile basis using a scale of 1 to 100 where 100 can either represent high ESG quality (positive) or high ESG risk (negative).

Many ratings providers claim to measure industry-relative ESG quality while some claim to measure absolute quality. Industry-adjusted ratings allow investors to compare ESG risk or performance across firms within the same industry. In this way an energy company that is more financially exposed to environmental risks can be identified against its peer group. However industry-adjusted ratings do not allow for comparison of firms across industries and a company’s rating is highly dependent on the industry it is designated to. By contrast ratings providers that claim to measure absolute ESG quality can be used for comparison across industries although firms tend to receive systematically higher or lower ratings depending on their line of business.

What Are the Subcomponents?

To arrive at an overall ESG rating ratings firms typically make separate assessments of the three components of ESG—E (environment) S (social) and G (governance)—which they then aggregate to compute an overall score. In measuring these the firm must have a view of the major factors that contribute to each component. These might be derived using statistical analysis of historical data to identify drivers of E S and G or they might be hypothesized based on a theoretical relation that is not tested.

For example MSCI identifies the following subcomponents of E S and G:

Environment

Climate change: The company’s contribution to climate change through emissions or the company’s exposure to harm due to climate change or climate-related regulatory action.

Natural capital: The degree to which the company relies on natural resources that might be at risk

Pollution and waste: The generation of waste (packaging materials or toxins) as part of the production or disposal of company goods.

Environmental opportunities: The potential to use environmental technology to improve operations or sales.

Social

Human capital: All aspects of human capital management including employment practices talent development safety and the labor standards of suppliers.

Product liability: The potential for products to cause harm because of quality failures safety failures financial harm privacy violations or data leaks chemical harm other health or demographic risk and the potential benefits of responsible investment to improve product quality safety or impact.

Stakeholder opposition: Societal opposition to the company because of controversial sourcing techniques or locations or other conflicts with local communities.

Social opportunities: The potential to benefit society by improving access to products.

Governance

Corporate governance: Factors relating to the quality of corporate oversight including the structure and composition of the board of directors shareholder ownership structure and control CEO pay practices and accounting quality.

Corporate behavior: Evidence into the ethical behavior of the company including anticompetitive practices corruption and tax shielding and transparency.

(See Exhibit 3 for examples of ESG frameworks).

Ratings providers may leverage reporting frameworks developed by third-party organizations. Examples include the reporting standards developed by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures and the Global Reporting Initiative. These frameworks offer the benefit of leveraging the work of independent organizations and are often similar to the proprietary frameworks developed by ESG ratings providers.

One observation is that the number of input variables is massively large. FTSE Russell claims its model uses 300 indicators. Refinitiv uses 630 ESG metrics. S&P Global uses 1000 underlying data points.

Managing this number of variables requires the ratings provider to make important decisions or simplifying assumptions. One is assessing materiality. Not all variables are equally material across companies or industries. As a result some variables might require larger or lesser weighting to reflect their relevance; some might be excluded entirely. Another decision is how to deal with missing data. Even though a variable might be deemed material this does not mean that the relevant data is available to measure that variable. (We discuss options for handling this decision below). A related decision is how to standardize variables when they are reported differently and therefore are not directly comparable across companies. Finally the ratings provider must decide how to weight both the variables in their importance to E S and G and also the overall pillars of E S and G in relation to one another.

All of these choices will influence the reported ESG rating.

What Are the Sources of Data?

The data sources used to populate ratings models include public quasi-public and private data. Public data includes company-reported filings with the SEC company-produced sustainability reports press releases newswires and media reports. Quasi-public information includes data captured in government regulatory and NGO datasets. Nonpublic information might be provided by the company in response to solicited questionnaires.

Working with data sets such as these brings inherent problems. Three major challenges are completeness of data standardization and consistency.

Completeness. A model that includes hundreds of material input variables requires data to support each variable. Much of this information is not publicly reported. As a result the ratings firm will have to make decisions about how to handle missing data. One approach is to simply omit the data point but this makes it difficult to compare scores across companies that report and do not report a value. Another is to make an assumption about what the data might be. For example when information is not available to populate a data point MSCI appears to assume that the company’s performance is the industry average. (In this case the choice of industry peer group will influence how the data point is populated.) By contrast FTSE assumes that the company’s performance is the worst. (This choice is intended to encourage transparency but is also likely punitive.) A third approach is to estimate the data using advanced statistical techniques to impute the missing value.

Standardization. The problem of standardization occurs when companies report information on the same variable using scales that are not directly comparable. For example one company might report workplace safety information using raw numbers (number of incidents) a time scale (injuries per unit of time worked) or a percentage scale (lost-time frequency). The ratings provider must standardize these differences across companies in order to compute overall ESG performance.

Consistency. To improve the performance of models a ratings provider might make retroactive adjustments to historical data. For example the data included in a model five years ago might not be the same as the data in the model today for that same year. Data changes are made to improve the accuracy of models as new or better data is made available. However they have the effect of making a model look more predictive than it was. Revising past data based on observed subsequent outcomes can invalidate the results from back testing. This is an important concern when evaluating the predictability and validity of commercial ESG ratings.

The impact of routine methodological choices such as these can be seen in the example of Refinitiv. Berg Fabisik and Sautner (2021) show that methodological changes adopted by Refinitiv in 2020 resulted in major changes to both current and historical ratings. Median scores were 18 percent lower with rewritten changes with 44 percent and 16 percent swings in E and S scores respectively. These revisions also changed the predictive results of the ratings. Stocks with high ESG scores outperformed in the rewritten data but not in the original data. They observe that “data rewriting is an ongoing rather than a one-off phenomenon” no doubt reflective of firms working to improve the usefulness of their data.

Do They Demonstrate What They Say?

Having reviewed the objectives and methodological choices of ESG firms we can better understand the research evidence regarding ESG ratings quality consistency and effectiveness. Unfortunately it is rare for ratings providers to offer concrete systematic evidence to back up claims about their ratings.

Investor Perception of ESG Ratings

Practitioners profess a lack of understanding about the methodologies and reliability of ESG ratings. The Alternative Investment Management Association (AIMA) which represents such firms globally reports that its members “have experienced challenges in terms of understanding and validating the approaches used by different ratings providers.” The European Securities and Market Authority describes the market for ESG ratings as “immature” based on its structure and dispersion of methodologies. A 2020 study of institutional investors uncovers widespread concerns including inaccuracy and inconsistency of data inexperienced research analysts and a perception that ESG quality cannot be distilled to a score.

Patterns in ESG Ratings

Systemic patterns are observed in ESG ratings. One pattern is related to company size: Large companies receive higher average ratings than smaller companies. This might be due to the more significant resources large firms are able to invest in ESG initiatives or it might be due to the fact that large companies have greater disclosure of ESG data. A second pattern is industry-related: While some ESG ratings are industry-adjusted those that are not may have higher average scores for certain industries (such as banks and wireless communications) than for others (such as tobacco and gaming). It is not clear if these patterns are due to fundamental differences in ESG quality across industries or a result of the methodological choices and input variables that underpin ESG ratings models. A third pattern is country-related: European companies have higher average ESG scores than U.S. companies which might be due to political and regulatory differences across countries. Firms in emerging markets also have lower ratings than firms in more developed economies.

Ratings Improvements

Research also demonstrates an upward drift in ESG ratings over time. D.E. Shaw (2022) analyzes the aggregate ESG scores for all Russell 1000 companies as calculated by MSCI between January 2015 and December 2021. They find an 18 percent aggregate improvement over the measurement period. Structural changes account for 6 percentage points of this improvement. These include:

Changes in the index composition with higher-rated companies (such as Microsoft) growing over time to represent a larger percentage of the total index.

Changes in the weightings assigned to components in the MSCI model. For example MSCI eliminated key issue scores for “energy efficiency” reduced weightings for “toxic emissions” and “health and safety” and increased weightings for “human capital development” leading to higher average scores than would have occurred if these weightings had not changed.

More disclosure by companies. Companies that increased disclosure (for example by disclosing their carbon emissions) were significantly more likely to experience a subsequent upgrade without regard to the fact that the company’s underlying performance in this area did not necessarily change.

Adjusting for these structural changes D.E. Shaw still finds that MSCI ratings are subject to an aggregate 12 adjusted-improvement (which the report describes as “grade inflation”). They do not explain the reason for this improvement.

Correlations Across Providers

Studies find low correlations across ESG ratings providers. This is perhaps surprising if ESG ratings are supposed to measure the same construct.

CFA Institute (2021) finds correlations across the major providers ranging from 0.65 (between S&P Global and Sustainalytics) to 0.14 (between ISS and S&P Global). Dimson Marsh and Staunton (2020) find not only that ESG ratings vary across providers but the individual components (E S and G) also vary widely. For example assessments of the E S and G components as determined by MSCI and Sustainlytics exhibit correlations of only 0.11 0.18 and -0.02 respectively. This suggests either they are measuring unrelated constructs or they have significant measurement error in measuring the same construct (see Exhibit 4).

Sources: Kevin Prall “ESG Ratings: Navigating Through the Haze” blog posting at CFA Institute (August 10 2021); Florian Berg Julian F. Kölbel and Roberto Rigobon “Aggregate Confusion: The Divergence of ESG Ratings” Review of Finance (2022).

Berg Kölbel and Rigobon (2022) try to identify reasons why ESG ratings diverge across providers. They deconstruct ratings along three dimensions: scope (the attributes the ratings providers attempt to measure) measurement (the measures used to evaluate the same attributes) and weighting (the weights assigned to attributes in reflection of their relative importance). They find that differences in measurement (56 percent) and scope (38 percent) account for most of the divergence with weighting differences accounting for just 6 percent of the variance. This illustrates how fundamental the methodological differences are across firms.

Perhaps unexpected Christensen Serafeim and Sikochi (2022) find that corporate disclosure does not reduce the divergence of ESG ratings but instead increases it. They explain that “due to the subjective nature of ESG information … higher disclosure would be associated with higher disagreement as disclosure expands opportunities for different interpretations of information.” This suggests that greater corporate disclosure requirements of environmental and social data might not lead to more consistent ESG ratings. In this way ESG ratings might be similar to equity analyst ratings where the rating is ultimately dependent on the interpretation of information rather than its availability.

The divergence of ESG ratings has several implications. One is the potential to confuse investment decisions by giving unreliable information about the ESG quality of firms. Another is that it hampers the disclosure that fund managers make to investors regarding the overall ESG quality of their portfolio. A third is that it reduces the incentive of companies to improve their ESG performance by sending unreliable signals about how their ESG initiatives are assessed by third-party observers.

Environmental and Social Outcomes

Studies find that ESG ratings have low associations with environmental and social outcomes.

A review of MSCI ratings conducted by Bloomberg finds that most upgrades occur for what Bloomberg calls “rudimentary business practices” rather than substantive improvements. In justifying 155 upgrades MSCI cited governance improvements almost half (42 percent) of the time—significantly more than social (32 percent) or environmental (26 percent) improvements. Upgrades were often driven by check-the-box practices such as conducting an employee survey that might reduce turnover and rarely for substantial practices such as an actual reduction in carbon emissions. Half of companies were upgraded for doing nothing—the result of methodological changes.

Raghunandan and Rajgopal (2022) find that companies in ESG portfolios (those with high Sustainalytics ratings) have worse records for compliance with labor and environmental laws relative to companies in non-ESG portfolios during the same period. Companies added to ESG portfolios also do not subsequently improve compliance with labor or environmental regulations.

Gibson Glossner Krueger Matos and Steffen (2022) find that U.S. firms that join the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) which commit a company to incorporate ESG factors into their decision-making processes earn worse ESG ratings (as assigned by MSCI Refinitiv and Sustainalytics) than U.S. firms that do not make this commitment.

Stock Price Outcomes

The relation between financial performance and ESG ratings is uncertain.

Dunn Fitzgibbons and Pomorski (2018) study the risk characteristics of companies based on their ESG ratings (as provided by MSCI). They find that companies with the lowest ratings have volatility that is up to 15 percent higher and betas up to 3 percent higher than stocks with the highest ratings. They also find that ESG scores might be predictive of future risk although the effects are modest. They conclude that “ESG information may play a role in investment portfolios that goes beyond the ethical considerations and may inform investors about the riskiness of the securities in a way that is complementary to what is captured by traditional statistical risk models.”

Hartzmark and Sussman (2019) examine the relation between fund sustainability and performance (using Sustainability fund ratings). They find that funds with low sustainability ratings perform better than those with high ratings. Bansal Wu and Yaron (2022) find that companies with high ESG ratings (by MSCI) perform better during good economic times but worse during bad economic times. Demers Hendrikse Joos and Lev (2021) study the performance of companies at the onset of Covid-19 and find no evidence that ESG ratings predict performance during this unexpected risk event. Lopez-de-Silanes McCahery and Pudschedl (2019) examine ESG ratings outside of the U.S.—primarily in European countries Australia and Japan. They find that ESG scores of companies domiciled in these countries are not associated with risk-adjusted performance.

Schröder (2007) and Dimson Marsh and Staunton (2020) both find that ESG indexes created by ESG ratings firms (such as MSCI and FTSE Russell) exhibit outperformance during their prelaunch periods only to underperform after their launch dates. This suggests that ESG indexes are created through back-testing methods that do not result in a sustainable investment strategy.

Atz Liu Bruno and Van Holt (2021) provide a substantial literature review of over 1100 primary peer-reviewed papers and 27 meta-analyses on ESG and sustainable investing published between 2015 and 2020. They conclude that “the financial performance of ESG investing has on average been indistinguishable from conventional investing.”

It might be the case that while the ratings published by any single ratings provider are not predictive of performance the assessments of multiple providers might be informative when considered in aggregate. To this end Berg Kölbel Pavlova and Rigobon (2021) attempt to combine the ratings of multiple providers to reduce the “noise” from conflicting assessments. They find some evidence that combining the scores from multiple firms leads to a stronger relationship between ESG and performance.

Structural Characteristics of the Industry

Several structural features might influence the quality of ESG ratings. These include:

The financial incentive for ratings to be adopted without regard to quality. Many advisory firms benefit from the use of ratings including firms that advise companies on how to improve ESG disclosure and ratings audit firms who are paid to attest to the accuracy of disclosure and investment firms who market ESG-compliant products to the general public. These firms financially benefit from the use of ratings even if the ratings themselves ultimately do not provide reliable information to retail investors.

Conflicts of interest due to the sale of consulting services to rated companies. In general the practice of offering paid services to rated companies to increase their ratings at least raises serious concerns about whether this compromises the independence of those ratings.

Conflicts of interest when a ratings provider rates an affiliated company. Tang Yan and Yao (2022) show that “sister firms” of an ESG ratings provider receive higher ratings from the affiliated ratings firm than they do from independent firms.

Incentives to adopt aggressive methodological choices to gain market share or recognition. For example a ratings agency might assign low ratings to a company to compel it to increase disclosure even though that methodological choice is misleading to the investor. Or a ratings firm might assign artificially positive ratings to gain favor with and recognition from rated companies.

Why This Matters

The purpose of ESG ratings is to provide information to market participants about the quality of a company’s ESG program and potential risks that might arise due to societal or environmental exposure. However current evidence is mixed on whether these models which rely on a large number of input variables predict investment risk or return. It is also increasingly unclear whether they capture or predict improvements in stakeholder outcomes. What is the source of this failure? Is it due to methodological choices these firms make? Or is it due to the sheer challenge of measuring a concept as broad and all-encompassing as “ESG?” ESG ratings are relied on by institutional investors to develop portfolios and attract investment dollars from retail investors. These funds often charge higher fees than non-ESG funds. Are institutional fund managers properly motivated to ensure that the ESG ratings they rely on to create these funds are reliable in predicting risk or performance? What steps do they take to validate ratings before using them? Many retail investors purchase ESG funds in order to ensure their investments reflect certain societal values or environmental standards. Do they know that the ESG ratings used to create these portfolios do not necessarily attempt to measure a company’s commitment to those values or standards? Should ESG fund managers disclose this? Given the substantial research evidence that ESG ratings are unreliable in predicting outcomes why do individual and institutional investors rely so heavily on them? Despite these weaknesses do ESG ratings still have a role to play as a trusted third-party opinion of ESG risk or as a common language for use in reporting in compliance purposes? A fundamental challenge for ESG ratings providers is access to quality data to use in their models. Would more expansive corporate disclosure improve the reliability of ESG ratings or would it add noise to already extensive disclosure requirements? Is it possible for companies to effectively report on the vast number of potential stakeholder-related metrics that would be required (carbon emissions pollution and waste human capital management supply chain practices product use and safety etc.)? The major credit rating agencies Moody’s Standard & Poor’s and Fitch are subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission which requires covered firms to adhere to certain policies procedures and protections to reduce conflicts of interest and improve market confidence in their quality. Should ESG ratings be subject to similar requirements?

The RCA CPPI National All-Property Index rose 16.8% from a year ago marking a continued slowdown from the record rates seen at the start of 2022.

Price growth has eased as investors became more hesitant in the face of challenges such as rising interest and mortgage rates and concerns over the chances of a recession.

Price increases for suburban offices slipped to an annual rate of 7.8% in July the tenth consecutive month of decelerating growth. Price growth for offices in central business districts (CBDs) eased as well slowing to a 7.7% annual rate. The 3-month increase for the CBD-office index of 0.4% indicated an even slower pace of yearly growth at an annualized figure of just 1.7%.

Retail apartment and industrial off highs

The retail sector index increased 17.7% in July from a year ago. While this pace of growth is still well above much of this index’s history it has eased for five months in a row. The annual price increase for apartments dipped to 20.9% keeping it in the 20%-24% range seen since November 2021.

The industrial index outpaced all property types with the highest annual growth rate of 24.4%. Still this pace marked a retreat from the near-27% record rate seen earlier in the year. The 3-month change for the index of 4.0% indicated a 16.9% annualized rate of growth weaker than the annual price growth posted."

FIZZ's portfolio includes brands like La Croix Shasta Faygo Everfresh Rip It ClearFruit Mr. Pure Ritz Crystal Bay Cascadia Ohana Punch Big Shot and Double Hit.

National Beverage stock has added over 25% in the past 12 months and it's added more than 20% in 2022. The stock is coming off an eight-month peak of $57.65 which was touched on $57.65 with support at the 20-day moving average capturing its recent pullback. FIZZ was last seen up 1% at $56.22.

Options traders have been quite bullish lately. At the International Securities Exchange (ISE) Cboe Options Exchange (CBOE) and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX) the security sports a 50-day call/put volume ratio of 6.73 which sits higher than 88% of readings from the past year. This implies calls are much more popular than usual.

Echoing this the security's Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio (SOIR) of 0.48 stands higher than just 2% of annual readings. This means short-term options traders have rarely been more call-biased.

The beverage business is estimated to generate 5.4% revenue growth and 7.1% earnings growth for fiscal 2023. FIZZ is also estimated to increase its revenues and earnings by 5.3% and 10.5% respectively for fiscal 2024 signaling an expected improvement to the bottom-line growth rate. In addition National Beverage maintains a manageable balance sheet with $48.05 million in cash and $61.25 million in total debt.

However FIZZ has struggled to produce consistent top and bottom line growth in recent years. For fiscal 2022 National Beverage reported a 9% decrease in net income despite growing revenues 6.1%. The beverage company has also grown its annual revenues and annual net income just 12.2% and 12.5% respectively since fiscal 2019 making FIZZ’s valuation appear much less attractive. Currently National Beverage stock trades very rich at a forward price-earnings ratio of 31.06 and a price-sales ratio of 4.58 meaning it is undoubtedly overvalued."

Customers running SAP HANA on AWS often need to be able to perform routine maintenance tasks such as creating backups and cloning production database volumes for upgrade and development testing.

Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP with the optional NetApp SnapCenter Plug-In offers integrated support for application consistent snapshot and cloning capabilities for SAP HANA databases. By leveraging the capabilities of FSx for ONTAP file systems SAP HANA database administrators can automate accelerate and simplify the processes of backing-up replicating and cloning their critical production environments. These features of storage-based snapshotting and cloning are in use today by enterprises for development testing disaster recovery and system upgrades with virtually no impact to availability or performance of their production SAP HANA databases.

On May 10th 2022 AWS announced the certification of SAP HANA on AWS with Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP. SAP HANA is supported for production workloads running on certain EC2 instances with Amazon FSx for ONTAP Single-AZ file systems.

In this blog post I describe using FSx for ONTAP Single-AZ file systems to create storage-based snapshots and clones of your critical SAP HANA databases to help enable quicker time-to-market and faster test and development cycles.

Overview

The FSx for ONTAP Single-AZ file system SSD storage tier is certified by SAP for SAP HANA-based workloads. FSx for ONTAP file systems deliver consistent sub-millisecond latency can scale throughput IOPS and SSD tier storage capacity independently and can take snapshots of any size volume in seconds. Snapshots are point-in-time efficient read-only replicas of the storage volumes. Single-AZ FSx for ONTAP file systems are powered by a pair of file servers in a highly available configuration within a single availability zone (figure 1).

Figure 1: FSx for NetApp ONTAP Single Availability Zone

It’s important to create and maintain regular backups for mission critical SAP workloads. While traditional streaming backup methods may be sufficient for many use cases a benefit of using FSx for ONTAP is that it provides native built-in application-consistent snapshot and replication capabilities.

The following diagram (figure 2) shows at a high level how the optional NetApp SnapCenter software coordinates the database snapshot and backup process using a plug-in installed on the SAP HANA database server. The SnapCenter management software is installed on an EC2 instance running a Windows Server OS and the storage systems and database server snapshots are managed using a simple web interface (figure 3).

Prerequisites

This blog post assumes that the reader understands AWS services SAP HANA databases and has familiarity with the FSx for ONTAP file system. Deployment of this solution requires access to the SAP HANA database software from SAP as well as the SnapCenter software from NetApp. Customers should contact their AWS sales representative to learn more if previous agreements are not already in place.

Benefits of Running SAP HANA using FSx for ONTAP

Running SAP HANA on FSx for ONTAP file systems brings benefits like being able to automate system backups using the NetApp SnapCenter SAP HANA Plug-In enabling scaling of storage IOPS throughput and capacity discretely and offering consistent low latency performance. The FSx for ONTAP file system also offers the ability to rapidly take application consistent storage-based snapshots. There are multiple use cases for leveraging storage-based snapshots for large in-memory databases but we can break them down into three key categories by functionality:

Backup Offsite Copy Development test system upgrade or migration disaster recovery testing Checking for logical corruption

Backups differ from the other use cases in that they do not require write access on the secondary file system used to store the off-site copy. All other scenarios require read / write availability of the replicated or cloned data.

Backups

Backups are an important part of any enterprise data protection policy. Traditionally with SAP HANA deployed on AWS the backup plan may include a streaming copy of data from the primary database to an Amazon S3 bucket with the AWS Backint Agent service. While this remains an effective strategy as customer database sizes grow larger this solution can be both time consuming and resource intensive for the SAP HANA database server.

Conversely ONTAP snapshots can be created on the storage service directly. This relieves the pressure on the EC2 instance where the SAP HANA database is running since it no longer needs to coordinate and stream the backup data. When a backup is executed leveraging the plug-in for SAP HANA through NetApp SnapCenter it initiates a database-consistent save point. Snapshot copies are then created on the underlying volumes of the primary FSx for ONTAP file system in seconds. SnapCenter can then also coordinate the replication of individual snapshots to a secondary file system which can be either an FSx for ONTAP file system in AWS (figure 4) or a NetApp storage system running on-premises. The snapshots can be decoupled from the primary file system and stored for a longer retention period on the secondary file system using NetApp SnapVault. The secondary file system can be located in AWS in a different availability zone a different region or even back to the on-premises customer data center. The SnapCenter software manages the scheduling of the backup and replication jobs as well as the retention of the snapshot copies on the primary file system. Additionally it’s recommended to have a supplemental weekly file-based backup in order to execute a block integrity check which can also be managed by the SnapCenter software.

Figure 4: FSx for NetApp ONTAP SnapVault Backup

Dev/test and quality assurance (QA) for migrations and DR

Similar to backup other activities like development and testing also require a copy of the production database. The difference is that for dev and test the copies need to be actively available for other systems to interact with. Without FSx for ONTAP storage this can introduce the following challenges:

Traditional backup/restore operations on large sized databases can take hours or more and therefore tests can be delayed while waiting for this process to complete The backup and restore process used for creating database copies can be resource intensive for both source and target systems Creating and storing additional production sized copies adds extra storage costs especially in environments where multiple development and test systems are required

With the earlier backup use-case individual point-in-time snapshots were replicated and stored at a secondary location with a longer retention policy for the purpose of being recalled for disaster recovery. Conversely in the test and development use-case the production volumes are either replicated to a secondary file system with all snapshots intact or cloned in place. Also for development and testing the SnapMirror replication may be to the same availability zone or can even be created locally on the same FSx for ONTAP file system.

The snapshot process happens in seconds and multiple snapshots can be scheduled throughout the day. Cloning a snapshot for use on a development system also happens in seconds and can be refreshed at any time by manually taking a new snapshot and creating a new clone. This enables an SAP admin to create point-in-time copies of production data for development and testing faster than via a streaming backup.

SnapMirror replication copies only the changed blocks since the previous replication event (figure 5) but preserves the full snapshot history of the volume. The processing is handled by the storage file system and removes the overhead of copying the data off of the database server.

Multiple clones of the snapshots can be made on the primary or secondary system for access by several different test and development database servers. The clones are efficient and share identical blocks on the same file system reducing the required amount of total storage.

The snapshot cloning and SnapMirror replication processes do not interrupt the ongoing data protection policy used for the backup.

Figure 5: FSx for NetApp ONTAP SnapMirror Replication

Checking for logical corruption

In most cases when a SAP HANA database has encountered corruption the recommendation is to restore from a known-good backup and apply transaction logs as needed to recover completely. However for situations where an environment has encountered corruption in the live production database a clone of a snapshot from before the time the corruption occurred may be mounted to another database server to perform logical repairs instead (figure 6).

Logical corruption can be caused by several factors but doesn’t always result in the complete unavailability of the database and in certain situations it may be desirable to repair instead of restore the database. For example

If the corruption is understood and limited in scope If the corruption needs to be studied in detail before reverting Backups are suspect or unavailable

In this scenario snapshots on the production file system are used in conjunction with a repair server to fix the logical corruption. Snapshots are a preferable solution to recovering to a full backup in this scenario because of the speed in which they can be mounted and examined.

ONTAP snapshots constitute a full point-in-time copy of all the data needed to perform a recovery. However in order to mount a writable copy of a snapshot it must first be cloned. The complete process of both cloning and mounting the volume to the repair system via NFS happens in only seconds. This means that multiple tests to various points-in-time can happen in quick succession. This assists the business and database administrators to locate and fix the source of corruption with minimal disruption to the production environment.

Considerations

For optimal performance and data efficiency the ONTAP volumes should be laid out such that each key component is contained within its own Storage Virtual Machine (SVM). This is done to prevent throughput bottlenecks from the interfaces on the SAP HANA database server (figure 7).

Figure 7: FSx for NetApp ONTAP Storage Layout for SAP HANA

ONTAP snapshots are taken at a volume level and store data alongside the production data. Each volume keeps its own set of snapshots based on the default policy used at creation. Because these snapshots are not application aware they should be disabled in favor of snapshots created by the SnapCenter plug-in for SAP HANA. To perform this task from the FSx for ONTAP file system command line interface:

Disable the default snapshot schedule on all volumes

FsxId01234567890abc::> vol modify -volume <vol_name> -vserver <svm_name> -snapshot-policy none

Additionally both storage efficiency and storage tiering are not supported by SAP HANA and need to be disabled. These options may be selected during volume creation or these commands can be executed from the FSx for ONTAP file system command line interface:

Disable storage efficiency

FsxId01234567890abc::> volume efficiency off -volume <vol_name> -vserver <svm_name> Disable storage tiering

FsxId01234567890abc::> vol modify -volume <vol_name> -vserver <svm_name> -tiering-policy none

Finally it is recommended to set the TCP max transfer size on the FSx for ONTAP file system to 262144 for optimal performance. This is an advanced command only available through the ONTAP command line interface:

Set the TCP max transfer size

FsxId01234567890abc::> set advanced Warning: These advanced commands are potentially dangerous; use them only when directed to do so by NetApp personnel. Do you want to continue? {y|n}: y FsxId01234567890abc::*> vserver nfs modify -vserver <svm_name> -tcp-max-xfer-size 262144 Warning: Setting ""-tcp-max-xfer-size"" to a value greater than the configured TCP transfer size could affect the performance for existing connections. Contact technical support for guidance. Do you want to continue? {y|n}: y FsxId01234567890abc::*> set admin FsxId01234567890abc::>

Conclusion

In this blog post I covered the benefits of using FSx for NetApp ONTAP Single-AZ file systems with the SnapCenter Plug-In for SAP HANA. These include protecting and replicating your critical SAP HANA database application as well as rapidly recovering in case of disaster or logical corruption. You can now deploy and manage both production and replicated copies of your data stored on fast and efficient ONTAP volumes.

This leads to cross-vendor and cross-cloud data orchestration and access. Hammerspace CEO and founder David Flynn briefed us on what the ramifications of this repositioning were as well as discussing Hammerspace’s business progress and recent revenue growth. We’ll look at the filesystem layer re-positioning here and move on to the follow-on features and advantages with reference to a radar diagram and business progress in later part 2 and part 3 articles.

Here’s a Hammerspace briefing deck slide to show David Flynn’s layering views:

The left-hand stack is today’s stack with file systems embedded in a storage system layer with a data management and protection layer above that. These three layers sit below the application. The right-hand stack has the storage system at the bottom with the file system layer sitting directly beneath the application. The application talks to the file system layer and it then talks to the data orchestration layer not a data management and protection layer which in turn operates on the storage layer.

New layer cake

David Flynn

In Flynn’s view: “File systems have been embedded within the storage system or service. If I use EFS that’s inside of Amazon and a specific region. If I use a NeTapp that’s in a specific data centre in a specific locality and data management has always been done between these. This leads to a fractured and shifting view of data because the act of managing data is actually creating different data because you’re copying from one file system to another in a different thing.”

“And that leads to I would call data schizophrenia. Where’s my data? I have no control of my data. Either I imprison it in a silo or I manage it by copy.”

Flynn said: “Data management disappears as a separate thing and it becomes data orchestration behind the facade of the file system.”

“What we are proposing is radical in that it’s a reordering of the very layering that whole industries have been built around. Data management and storage infrastructure have assumed this broken ordering and layering. And so what we’re saying is look pull the file system out. The file system should be adjacent to the applications and the users. It should transcend any of the infrastructure and that allows data management to disappear as a separate thing and become data orchestration behind the file system.”

This re-layering provides a single view of data: “It gives you a singular consistent view of data data that you have minute and powerful control of because through the file system you’re expressing how the data should be rendered how it should exist across your highly decentralised and highly diverse infrastructure.”

This requires a new kind of file system.

File system development history

Flynn sees a progression of file system development over time: “Going back to the beginning file systems have always been the heart of the problem file system and have always been the most challenging part of the operating environment whether it was operating systems before or cloud operating environments. The file system has been the most difficult thing.”

Hammerspace slide

“DOS was named after a disk operating system right? The old fat 16 Fat 32. And it’s what made Microsoft after they pulled that file system out of the mainframe and put it into the individual OS and allowed a commoditization away from mainframes.

“NetApp took that file system and embedded it in an appliance. Remember they took the file system and put it into the array. And that was the defining difference between a RAID array or a Fibre Channel SAN and NAS. And what made NAS so sticky is it had a file system embedded in it which gives you a shared view of data. It improved the scope and enabled the data to be more global than it was before. And there was no going back from that.”

“We went forward with Isilon where you now were able to scale out across multiple nodes. And so they improve the scalability. And by the way they didn’t take market share from NetApp they create a new market by taking it to a new scale where where file systems had not gone before.”

The public cloud vendors wanted more scale and prioritized that over file system performance: “Along comes folks who want to build the cloud. They want a utility model of computing they want to host multiple tenants in the hundreds and 1000s in their data centre scale mainframe. And building a file system is massively difficult. So what do they do?

“They throw out the baby with the bathwater and they say let’s invent super simple storage. Let’s have it do nothing but data retention not have any performance. Accessing OSes don’t know how to talk to it naturally you’d have to rewrite your application. You don’t have random read and write. The OS can’t just page it in. Right. So they basically said let’s throw out everything that’s hard and everything that’s useful out of a file system.”

He backs this up by saying Amazon’s EFS “doesn’t support Windows and doesn’t have snapshots and clones.”

He asks: “And why has NetApp and Isilon survived with the onslaught of cloud? It’s because their file system the WAFL file system and OneFS  they’re really the only games out there when it comes to a true enterprise grade capable file system. And the file systems in the cloud are very poor approximations of that.”

In his thinking Hammerspace’s Global Data Environment platform is what comes next: “What I’m telling you is we are the logical successor here.”

Hammerspace is: “building a file system that is now fully spanning of all infrastructure including across whole data centres that has never existed before. And we did that by using parallel file system architecture. And pushing open standards to have that parallel file system plumbing.”

Flyyn says: “The NFS 4.2 open source implementation came from my team; the standard the open source and we put windows SMB and old NFS v3 in. We bridge them on top. So now they get the benefit of scalability of parallel file system. But you can still serve all the legacy protocols. It’s the best of both worlds parallel file system scalability with legacy protocol in front of it.”

He said: “In the supercomputing world in HPC they’ve used parallel file system architecture to scale performance. It just turns out not surprisingly that that same architecture lets you scale across third party infrastructure across data centres and to support many many different clients because now you can instantiate this on behalf of each client on each customer. But it’s a new breed of file system. It’s a file system that operates by reference instead of a file system that’s operating by being in the storage infrastructure.”

Therefore: “At the end of the day what this means is that you have a unified unified metadata. And you have a single consistent view of data regardless of location and regardless of the location you’re using the data or the location where the data is originally housed. And through AI and machine learning we can orchestrate data to be where you need it when you need it.”

Management

He says: “We’re in desperate need of digital automation to automate the management of data.” And it can’t be done with old-style layering.

Flynn asserts that: “If the management is outside of the file system then by copying between file systems you’re fracturing the view of the data. It’s different data. You have to put the management behind the file system before you can automate it.”

In his view: “You have to fix the layering and the entire industry these industries worth 10s of billions of dollars have been operating under that broken assumption of management is outside of the file system.”

Once data management as a separate upper stack layer is replaced by a data orchestration layer below the file system then you can automate data management; it becomes a set of orchestration functions.

Up-down flow in Hammerspace layers

Flynn says current file data sharing between dispersed entity components in a film studio’s video production supply chain for example work on the basis of file copying.

He says that: “What Hammerspace represents for the first time is the ability to share data by reference by having people in the same file system across different organisations. … the point is that you’re sharing data by reference within the file system instead of sharing data by copy.”

If we say the dispersed people in this data supply chain operate in the same file system namespace then that might make things clearer. The filesystem moves files to where they are needed instead of the application or users making and sending copies around this ecosystem from silo to silo. How does Hammerspace achieve this?

It uses metadata tagging. It has an integration with Autodesk ShotGrid the production management and review toolset for VFX TV movie production animation and games teams.

Autodesk ShotGrid asset library screen

Flynn said: “So ShotGrid just by saying I want to do this rendering job over in this data centre will label the metadata in the file system and that will cause the data to be pre-orchestrated [moved] into the other data centre just the stuff that’s actually needed for that job.”

Here the application ShotGrid gives its intent to the filesystem. It needs a file or files to be made available to to users at a distant data centre and inputs that intent as a metadata item. The file system picks this up and orchestrates the data movement from the source storage system to the destination storage system – showing the up-down interaction between the layers in Hammerspace’s re-organised application data stack. ShotGrid is not concerned with the underlying storage systems at all here.

Listen to this article

The state of the storage administrator role is in flux -- but just how close to the brink of extinction or to a dramatic career re-imagining is up for discussion.

The reasons for the change are familiar. They include the rise of hybrid cloud data centers through the adoption of virtualization along with the ongoing uptake of newer technologies such as containers. Together they are bringing the role of the storage administrator to a professional flashpoint.

Historically the storage administrator position involved a gray-collar mix of duties such as installing and maintaining storage hardware in data centers while provisioning storage services for other IT teams through command lines or other specialized vendor software.

Now some storage admins feel their positions are imperiled by vendor managed services but CIOs hiring for the role see a job reformatted into new responsibilities such as data stewardship data placement and infrastructure cost management.

The most important rule any storage admin needs to follow -- one every industry expert and IT manager interviewed for this article agreed with -- is not to limit the role to the title alone.

The first rule of being a storage administrator today is don't talk about being a storage administrator. Dave RaffoSenior analyst Evaluator Group

""The first rule of being a storage administrator today is don't talk about being a storage administrator"" said Dave Raffo senior analyst at Evaluator Group. ""You don't want to run around telling people that you're [just] a storage guy.""

Calling hours At the recent HPE Discover 2022 conference in Las Vegas Hewlett Packard Enterprise pitched its GreenLake managed services to attending customers as the future for simplifying employee overhead and removing in-house technology complications. ""Users have almost unlimited storage with access to growth without worrying about acquiring or refreshing hardware"" said Maciej Glowacki an IT systems manager attending the conference. GreenLake according to HPE removes most on-premises infrastructure operations by outsourcing those duties to the vendor a ""one throat to choke"" approach HPE has developed to compete with similar packages from hardware companies such as Dell Technologies and NetApp as well as hyperscalers like AWS and Microsoft Azure. Some storage professionals in attendance who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation and job security saw aspects of GreenLake as a professional threat. Managed services that automatically provision storage update infrastructure hardware and allow anyone with access to the GUI to manage storage eliminate most traditional storage administrator duties. But industry observers like Marc Staimer president of Dragon Slayer Consulting disagreed with the premise that offerings such as GreenLake will cause the role of the storage administrator to disappear. Instead the job has to evolve with the times. GreenLake cannot for example determine what makes certain data more valuable than other data or determine the best cost-saving maneuvers he said. ""What can become a job killer for storage admins is data management"" Staimer said. ""What's valuable in reality is not the storage but the data that's in the storage."" Others see managed services like GreenLake as a way to augment rather than replace the role of the storage admin. ""Almost 75% of [Infinidat's] customers use alternative consumption models to Capex"" said Eric Herzog chief marketing officer of Infinidat a data storage company based in Herzliya Israel. ""These are big companies and they are not getting rid of their storage admins just because they're using storage as a service."" Infinidat has added automation to its products giving admins time to focus on other storage challenges Herzog said. Other competing vendors to Infinidat that are similarly leaning into automation include NetApp and Pure Storage.

Now (still) hiring A search for storage administrator positions on popular job positing websites such as Indeed still turns up plenty of results showing continued demand for the role. Glassdoor salary estimates and submissions vary from about $60000 for entry-level roles to more than $150000 for experienced managers. Garmin International in Olathe Kan. a manufacturer and developer of GPS hardware and software recently sought a storage administrator with a decade of professional experience and familiarity with S3 object storage as well as Dell Technologies and NetApp hardware. Barclays a British bank advertised a storage administrator position for its American R&D campus in Whippany N.J. asking for almost entirely on-premises experience with IBM Tivoli Storage Manager Veritas NetBackup and the vaultlike EMC Centera hardware. A similar role with a slightly different title IT systems administrator is advertised for the storage IT infrastructure team at Mount Sinai Health System a network of hospitals and medical offices in New York City. The role advertises hybrid cloud experience asking specifically for experience with Microsoft Azure as well as other storage vendors such as NetApp Pure and IBM. But the position also asks for other more data-savvy acumen such as assisting in technology roadmap development bringing new tools into the technology stack and communicating across departments about data needs said Kristin Myers executive vice president and CIO at Mount Sinai Health System. Kristin Myers Kristin Myers ""A valuable storage administrator is one who understands the critical role of data within an organization"" Myers said. ""They take the time to understand the end-to-end flow of data and the business requirements. They understand who needs to interact with the data integrations and interfaces; what type of data needs to be stored; how frequently it needs to be accessed; and how long it needs to be kept. These skills are critical whether the solution resides within the cloud or on premises."" Myers sees hybrid cloud adoption as the way forward in the medical industry which needs to juggle demanding aspects of data management such as regulatory compliance accessible data center locations and user collaboration involving files reaching several gigabytes in size. Looking ahead Myers sees storage using more cloud services to build out an IT infrastructure that's highly available to Mount Sinai patients and employees. Those services will require the storage administrator to develop experience in using infrastructure as code a DevOps practice; provisioning data; and monitoring cloud usage costs.

He quickly interrupted me. “There’s no such thing as Muslim comedy” he said. “What is Muslim comedy bro? Like what is that?”

Mo tells the story of the Najjar family undocumented refugees from Palestine living in Houston. Without papers Mo Najjar played by Amer comes up with creative ways to hustle all while avoiding ICE and being deported since he like many Palestinians is stateless. As his character puts it “I’ve never been to Palestine. I don’t have citizenship there; I don’t have citizenship here. I’m like a refugee free agent!”

Mo is a complex show—sometimes more so than I bargained for. (Watch it and you’ll see.) But I called it a “Muslim comedy” for the same reason I would call it a Houston comedy. Not because the audience has to be specifically Muslim or specifically Texan—or as Amer argued back because then it’d be “strictly for inside the mosque”—but because the show is part of an emerging style that feels transformative for the Muslim diaspora. I asked Amer if he thought for example that a show like this could have existed 10 years ago. “I was doing it!” he said. “I was waiting for everybody to catch up. It’s obviously very new but the subject matter is old.”

I’m not so sure about that at least on American screens. Talking about Palestine can still feel like a minefield in entertainment (as in so many places). But I get Amer’s hesitation in general. As a Muslim-American who has done some biographical work I know where those sensitivities come from. Labeling Mo a “Muslim show” might do the same thing U.S. popular media usually does to Muslims putting pressure on the work to stand in and speak for all of America’s 3.5 million Muslims. (This is often done to even more sinister effect in portrayals of Muslims who behave badly in real life and not.) It can also ghettoize the work. Though Mo is his scripted debut Amer 41 started doing comedy back in the late ’90s performing standup across the Bible Belt. This was pre-9/11. His audience “didn’t even know what an Arab was” he told me. People looked at him like he was a curiosity back then. He’s not looking for that now on the biggest stage of his career.

Again I get it. But I don’t think that fear should stop us from recognizing work that does speak directly to Muslim Americans and also defines the Muslim-American experience—OK one Muslim-American experience—in a groundbreaking way. Mo does that.

In the show when his Catholic girlfriend mockingly prays on Mo’s body he uses his hand to shoo it away saying “Astaghfirullah.” He doesn’t stop to explain that phrase to non-Muslims; he just moves on. In another moment near the end of the season Mo walks into a dangerous situation but pauses first to think about how he’d find a way out. “I’m just tying my camel” he says to another character another phrase that will make Muslims light up but won’t land with someone outside the faith. This show doesn’t only speak to Muslims—anyone can fall in love with this series and Amer’s charismatic style—but it may be best enjoyed by watching with at least one Muslim in the room.

But it’s not just the language Mo uses in the show. It’s the way the characters are responding to Islam even the non-Muslim ones. Mo Najjar says “Bismillah” and his best friend Nick played by Tobe Nwigwe says “That’s the hell you should be teaching me not bitizek” Arabic for “up your ass.” In another scene Mo’s girlfriend Maria (Teresa Ruiz) tries to create a relationship with Mo’s mother (Farah Bsieso) who crushes Maria by offering a bangle that would cover a cross tattoo on her wrist. In the show as in life Islam adds a layer of complexity to every inch of a Muslim’s life.

Seeing the nuanced ways that Islam interacts with personal and family drama is a relatively new phenomenon in mainstream American comedy ushered in by shows like Ramy. (Not incidentally its creator Ramy Youssef created Mo in partnership with Mo Amer.) Both of these shows opted to show rather than tell what Islam looks like when it’s interwoven in an American’s life and both have main characters who laugh at how deeply Islam is misunderstood. One of my favorite moments in Ramy whose third season arrives next month came in Season 1 when an old friend runs into Ramy as he’s finishing up one of the five daily prayers and puts him on the spot asking him to quickly pray for his mom. Ramy uncomfortably performs a fake prayer at one point saying the name of his old friend’s mother with a Quranic inflection. It’s hilarious to any Muslim who understands you can’t freestyle the ritual prayers but Youssef didn’t stop to explain that to the audience.

In roughly the time it took to make just one show we’ve been treated to several others that have Muslim and Arab roles that are complex and humanizing that don’t just portray Muslims as automatons acting out Islamic rituals (often comically incorrectly). And to have a Palestinian family in Mo that does not involve any mention of terrorism beyond two hilarious jokes about the conflation is that much more meaningful. With apologies to Amer for me the observable ways in which his comedy and writing—with Palestinian and Muslim identity at the forefront—helps define and deepen a collective sense of Muslim and Arab identity really does mark creators like him and Youssef as pioneers in a budding genre. This is something new.

Amer did say this much: “We’re a people that have been authentically faceless in Hollywood for many many years. When you say ‘Palestinian’ it don’t even have a face on it.” (He nodded toward the achievements of DJ Khaled who Mo jokes often about being his celebrity doppelganger before conceding that average person wouldn’t even know that Khaled is Palestinian.) While his intention was mainly to create an authentic story Amer understands that Mo is more than just another Netflix comedy. “For a kid from my background to look and see what somebody’s doing it makes them believe in themselves in such a way that they wouldn’t before” he said. “Before I was walking on gravel roads but now I’m paving them putting it down for other people to come around and create stories. That’s like the best accomplishment of my life.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vYWJvdXQubmV0ZmxpeC5jb20vZW4vbmV3cy9pbnRyb2R1Y2luZy10aGUtaW5hdWd1cmFsLWNvaG9ydC1mcm9tLXRoZS1maXJzdC1ldmVyLW5ldGZsaXgtc2VyaWVzLWRpcmVjdG9y0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Introducing the Inaugural Cohort from the First-Ever Netflix Series Director Development Program,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://about.netflix.com/en/news/introducing-the-inaugural-cohort-from-the-first-ever-netflix-series-director on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vYWJvdXQubmV0ZmxpeC5jb20vZW4vbmV3cy9pbnRyb2R1Y2luZy10aGUtaW5hdWd1cmFsLWNvaG9ydC1mcm9tLXRoZS1maXJzdC1ldmVyLW5ldGZsaXgtc2VyaWVzLWRpcmVjdG9y0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vcXouY29tL25ldGZsaXgtcy1uZnQtZXhwZXJpbWVudC13aXRoLWxvdmUtZGVhdGgtcm9ib3RzLWNvLTE4NDk0NTE4MzfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Netflix's sci-fi NFTs are the future of TV ratings,"Netflix’s status as a streaming innovator has been under assault in recent years but the company’s recent non-fungible token (NFT) experiment proves it’s still in the digital disruption game. The company released a series of nine NFTs on Opensea’s NFT marketplace in May each representing a scene from the third season of its popular science fiction anthology series Love Death + Robots.

Along with cutting-edge animation the series features the talents of actors such as Michael B. Jordan Mackenzie Davis Rosario Dawson Mary Elizabeth Winstead Joel McHale Topher Grace and Samira Wiley as well as adaptions of classic science fiction stories from Bruce Sterling Harlan Ellison John Scalzi J. G. Ballard and others. Without much fanfare other than a tweet and a subtle prompt in the closing credits of the season’s last episode  Netflix announced that it had hidden QR codes to some of the scenes in billboards and on social media so only the most hardcore fans participated in the initial offering.

Netflix’s NFT event is more about viewer data than blockchain profits

Netflix isn’t likely to make much money from the promotion a somewhat unique approach that veers away from the gold rush mentality that has typified much of the activity in the NFT space.



Even the most popular Love Death + Robots NFT—on “Exit Strategies” an episode about three robots examining the aftermath of humankind’s demise—is available for the floor price of 0.002 Eth ($3.36).

But a byproduct of the blockchain promotion which draws to a close on Sept. 24 has been an unofficial ranking of season three’s episodes with sales revealing which one fans loved the most. This has inadvertently offered the television industry a new way to gauge the true ratings of a show in the future.

Amer an actor and comedian who grew up in Houston plays a version of himself in the eight-episode series which is out today. Like the real Mo the one on TV is Palestinian and is in the middle of a decades-long legal struggle for citizenship. Without a work visa he has a hard time finding lawful work. His brother's cat can't seem to settle on a kibble she likes. And to cope he's started sipping lean – a mix of soda and Codeine.

""The immigration process makes it very difficult for him to you know do things that are above board because he don't have a work permit"" Amer said of his character. ""And then you have like the spiritual implications of that right: whenever you do something that you don't want to do but have to do it out of necessity and giving away a little bit of your morals. And then you have the loss of his father having to mourn him being stateless and feeling less than. So this is really a story about belonging and feeling like an equal human being to the one next to you. And that's a love letter to Houston as well.""

And making the show really feel like Houston was very important to the actor.

""There's never been a narrative sitcom filmed out of Houston out of Alief. Alief has been a great neighborhood in the Houston area that has been a phenomenal exporter of art artists music from front of the camera to behind the camera. I think it's just absolutely wild that it has never had a narrative sitcom"" he said. ""So it was so important to me like right out of the gate boom you're in Houston. Paul Wall's ‘The Peoples Champ' comes on. I thought that was such a great touch. Everything was so well thought-out. And even when I would describe the show to VPs I'd be like hey I want it to be like an urban Western. I want the rich golf clouds to be seen. I want the blue skies the bright sun the hot sun. I want you to feel that too.""

The show is autobiographical – but not down to every detail Amer said. ""I can't quantify it in like a percentage but I can definitely tell you that it's all based off of my life. I can tell you the stuff that's not: I'm not addicted to codeine"" Amer laughed. ""But it was a great complexity to the character that you can add write into the show."" Amer said he struggled initially with how the show would be received in his hometown but realized that those worries didn't matter if he trusted the time and effort put into it – and a COVID delay gave him more time than expected. ""It caused me to dig even deeper into myself and go through my own growth"" he said. ""And so it's pretty incredible to have those opportunities and it's rare that you can put that much time into something before putting it all together. And in the end I can't control what people say you know like I can't. You gotta trust the work."" Amer who has two comedy specials on Netflix noted that while standup is a solo art form implementing his storytelling into a scripted show has been very different. ""It requires a different type of thinking and thought process. You know especially with this story the complexities lie into for instance the flashbacks and the origin stories. The emotionality of that and then tracking it in present day"" he said. ""And then you have like all the other characters that you're surrounding your main character with – what they look like what they feel like what they say how they talk how they walk. It's like creating a whole world. ""And also to me as an Arab American like man I've seen too many Arabs on television they're supposed to be a certain part of the world that sound nothing like it. I want to cast somebody that knows the dialect speaks it it's been part of their life. You know all these things factor into making a great show a grounded show an authentic show.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvdHJhdmlzYmVhbi8yMDIyLzA4LzI1L25ldGZsaXgtaGFzLW5ldmVyLWhhZC1hLXNob3ctbGlrZS1leHRyYW9yZGluYXJ5LWF0dG9ybmV5LXdvby_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Netflix Has Never Had A Show Dominate Like 'Extraordinary Attorney Woo',ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/travisbean/2022/08/25/netflix-has-never-had-a-show-like-extraordinary-attorney-woo/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvdHJhdmlzYmVhbi8yMDIyLzA4LzI1L25ldGZsaXgtaGFzLW5ldmVyLWhhZC1hLXNob3ctbGlrZS1leHRyYW9yZGluYXJ5LWF0dG9ybmV5LXdvby_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The maize varieties which are drought tolerant and mature early (80 to 85 days) included Suhudoo Opeaburo Denbea Abotem and Wang-dataa.

The cowpea varieties which are tolerant to pest and disease infestation included Kirkhous Benga Padi-tuya Zamzam and Nketewade.

The varieties have been developed by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research – Savanna Agricultural Research Institute (CSIR-SARI) and the CSIR – Crops Research Institute (CSIR – CRI) and are being showcased as a climate change adaptation strategy.

The farmers visited a demonstration farm at Woribogu in the Tolon District of the region where the maize and cowpea varieties were planted to showcase how they were performing on the field.

At the demonstration farm the varieties were observed to be doing well compared to the farmers’ own varieties which were not doing well.

This formed part of the Accelerating Impacts of CGIAR Climate Research for Africa (AICCRA) project funded by the International Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank.

The AICCRA project is led by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture with the support of the CSIR – CRI Centre for Agriculture and Biosciences International Esoko Ghana Meteorological Agency and the University for Development studies.

It seeks to make climate information services and climate-smart agricultural innovations more accessible to small scale farmers across the country for optimal health outcomes for people animals and plants.

Climate change effects have rendered lands unproductive reduced the yields of many major crops and contributed to the distribution and severity of pests and diseases hence the climate-smart agricultural innovations to guarantee yields for farmers.

Dr Stephen Yeboah Senior Research Scientist at CSIR-CRI and Technical Focal Point for AICCRA project who explained the innovations on the demonstration field to farmers at Woribgu said adopting the maize and cowpea varieties would help farmers save a lot of money while improving their livelihoods.

Dr Yeboah said “Cowpea production is associated with a lot of challenges. A lot of chemicals are used in cowpea production and it is not healthy to the individual and the environment. So we are highlighting several cowpea varieties that are pest tolerant. Once they are tolerant it means that the farmer applies less chemicals in generating the needed yields which means less effects on the environment and on the human being doing the farming.”

He added that “Another benefit is the fact that some of the cowpea varieties are dual purpose which means that the farmer can harvest the pods for household food security and then some amount of fodder for livestock. The leaves are also harvested as vegetable. So this enhances livelihood and increases the economic value of the fields.”

He said “If you are doing large scale commercial farming you will end up having less cost with the improved varieties because you are not going to spray many more times. You will spray few times; two times unless the pest has reached a certain threshold. So you will end up saving money with the improved varieties compared to the farmers’ varieties.”

Dr Osman Damba Focal Person for AICCRA Ghana project at the University for Development Studies said the technologies being promoted showed that “Every farmer irrespective of your locations and income levels you can actually adapt to fit into the current effects of climate change.”

He said some of innovations were pro-vitamin varieties which would help boost nutritional status of consumers.

He urged farmers to work with agricultural extension agents in their communities to collectively identify the required technologies to address the nutritional and food security needs of their areas emphasising that “Remember every geographical area is soil specific and the nature of the soil will determine what variety will work very well in your area.”

Mustapha Alasan Dalaa National Coordinator of AICCRA project Ghana Cluster mentioned other crops being promoted under the project saying “We are promoting climate-smart agricultural practices in some selected value chains including yam sweet potato tomatoes and other leafy vegetables across the country. It is a particularly good intervention for farmers as it will improve their livelihoods.”

Amadu Ahmed Yussif a farmer said next farming season he would adopt the climate resilient improved varieties to guarantee him yields.

Zainab Fuseini another farmer said the varieties being promoted on the demonstration farm were better than what she had been planting and would adopt them for improved production and incomes.

Mr Fuseini Salifu Issifu District Chief Executive for Tolon advised farmers to embrace agricultural technologies generated through research to improve productivity.

He commended partners for the initiative appealing to them to extend it to cover other crops which were cultivated on a large scale in the district.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c2doYW5hLmNvbS5naC9oZXJkc21lbi1pbi1ib25vLWdpdmVuLW9uZS13ZWVrLXVsdGltYXR1bS10by1tb3ZlLWNhdHRsZS_SAVJodHRwczovL25ld3NnaGFuYS5jb20uZ2gvaGVyZHNtZW4taW4tYm9uby1naXZlbi1vbmUtd2Vlay11bHRpbWF0dW0tdG8tbW92ZS1jYXR0bGUv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Herdsmen in Bono given one-week ultimatum to move cattle,"The Bono Regional Security Council (REGSEC) has directed herdsmen whose cattle graze around local and forest fringe communities in the region to move their animals.

The Council has therefore given the herdsmen one-week-ultimatum to do so as a taskforce had been formed to comb shoot and kill any cattle that would be sighted in the communities with effect from Monday August 29 2022.

The REGSEC took the decision after a meeting held on Tuesday in Sunyani in connection with the killing of some cattle at Adoe a farming community in the Sunyani West Municipality of the region.

Some irate youth of Adoe went on rampage last Wednesday and killed some cattle which were causing extensive destruction of their farms and food produce.

The REGSEC however announced it had since arrested and placed in police custody a suspect Ernest Kwaku Adjei who claimed ownership of the more than 2000 cattle at Adoe pending investigations.

Briefing the Ghana News Agency about the outcome of the meeting Madam Justina Owusu-Banahene the Bono Regional Minister and Chairperson of the REGSEC said it was unacceptable for the herdsmen to allow their cattle to graze and destroy forest reserves and people’s property.

It was unlawful for owners to allow their animals to loiter in the towns said said. And advised them to either confine or lose their stray animals.

She directed the police to investigate the circumstances that led to the killing of the cattle at Adoe and submit their report to the REGSEC."

The figure — roughly the same from the first quarter of this year — is limited to projects with reported in-service years. Of the total developers have 51172 MW in planned solar projects and 40933 MW in planned wind projects according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data. At the end of 2021 the top developers had a project pipeline of 76.9 GW.

NextEra Energy Inc. has the most capacity of combined U.S. wind and solar projects with 18496 MW.

The Juno Beach Fla.-headquartered company has the largest solar project pipeline with 13152 MW. Of that 737 MW is under construction; 463 MW is in advanced development; 9418 MW is in early development; and 2534 MW of projects have been announced.

Apex Clean Energy Inc. has the largest wind project pipeline. Of its 8489 MW under development 225 MW is under construction; 487 MW is in advanced development; 5002 MW is in early development; and 2775 MW of capacity has been announced.

S&P Global Market Intelligence considers a project as under construction when building activity has begun; site preparation does not qualify. Projects in advanced development must meet two of five criteria: Financing is in place; power purchase agreements are signed; equipment is secured; required permits are approved; or a contractor has signed on to the project. A project is in early development after permitting begins. An announced project must have a listing in an interconnection queue with an accompanying public announcement or permitting action.

Of the top developers Invenergy LLC has the most solar power capacity under construction with 1870 MW. NextEra has the most wind power capacity under construction with 2031 MW.

New to the list of solar developers is Miami-based Origis Energy USA Inc. In October 2021 Antin Infrastructure Partners a French private equity firm acquired a majority stake in the company. Origis has a U.S. solar pipeline of 3382 MW of which 2930 MW is in early development.

British oil giant Shell PLC also earned a spot on the list of top U.S. solar developers with 2493 MW under development. Of that 93 MW is under construction; 180 MW is in advanced development; 2101 MW is in early development; and 120 MW of capacity has been announced.

Toto Holding of Italy took the No. 10 spot for U.S. wind developers with its two proposed wind projects off the coast of Maryland: the 808.5-MW Momentum Offshore Wind Project and the 768-MW Ocean City Offshore Wind Project (Marwin).

However this motion was denied 4-3 in keeping with staff’s recommendation to not move the project forward.

Corby’s proposal was for a battery storage facility on 24 acres of a 160-acre farm property off Midway and Meridian roads. The company sought to change the land’s designation from “agriculture” to “technology park” to allow for such a project.

Staff recommended the council deny the project on the basis that it conflicted with goals to bring in more biotechnology and advanced manufacturing businesses to the area conflicted with General Plan goals of providing balanced growth to the area and did not provide ongoing equipment upgrades that would increase the value.

However Community Development Director Erin Morris said Tuesday’s hearing was a merit hearing meaning the council would not consider approval or denial of the project but would consider the merits of having such a project at that site and entertain a process to move it forward if interested.

Dana Dean an attorney representing Corby went into further detail on the proposed project. She said battery storage was necessary because it provided energy at times when it wasn’t available.

“What we do with batteries is we fill them up during the day and when the other sources are eliminated battery storage is used to avoid brownouts and not being able to do your laundry and other things during the most-used energy time” she said. “Battery storage is incredibly important in our state.”

Dean even emphasized that Gov. Gavin Newsom is prioritizing bringing more battery storage centers to California and that the location near the Vaca-Dixon Pacific Gas & Electric substation on Quinn Road was a good fit.

“That is one of the most significant parts of the electrical infrastructure for our state” she said.

The proposal was for a 300-megawatt battery energy storage system that would include an on-site substation inverters and other ancillary amentiies such as fences roads a supervisory control and data acquisition system and a 230-kilovolt line overhead generation connection tie line which would connect to the Vaca-Dixon substation.

Dean also said it would generate up to 200 construction jobs and could allow for up to $2 million in property taxes to go toward the city and Vacaville Unified School District although this was just theoretical and a concrete dollar value would be provided after further research.

Stephen Ahn senior project manager for Corby said the project would not be located near any high-density residential areas but not far from the Vaca-Dixon substation which he said was vital for the project.

“In order for battery storage projects to be effective it needs to be close to a substation” he said. “Based on our research the Vaca-Dixon PG&E substation is the only high voltage substation within a 50-mile radius. That’s why we picked this location.”

Ahn said the center would be continuously monitored by an on-site system and off-site 24-hour control room. It would also have a cooling system and be engineered to prevent fire risks.

Deandra Cass senior environmental specialist with Corby’s parent company NextEra Energy said placing the project away from Interstate 80 would hopefully prevent it from affecting surrounding views.

Several carpenters spoke in favor of the project during public comments touting the local jobs it would provide in construction.

“Construction workers represent a large base of the workforce in this region” Kyle Sworns said. “When the majority of projects with a workforce that has low wages and little to no benefits NextEra has made a commitment to make sure workers on their projects will have livable wages health care not just for the workers but for their families.”

The property owner Gary Tierra said he ended up with the property just a few years after the housing bubble burst and it has been farmland ever since. He never received a phone call expressing interest until Corby did so.

“This project has value” he said.

However some neighbors expressed opposition to the project. Rebecca Salinas expressed concerns about fire hazards and impacts on the roads during construction.

“One of the reasons we bought that property is because it was the best combination of living in the country but also was 10 minutes away from the city” she said. “We don’t oppose the technology park at all we just hope the council will take into consideration preserving part of the agricultural aspect.”

Several of the council members agreed that a battery storage center was a good fit for Vacaville but not at that location.

“I happen to be on a hazmat team where I have some concerns regarding when this stuff burns what it does” Councilman Roy Stockton said. “I’ve seen the evacuation of a community in Fairfield with only 400 pounds of some of these batteries and I know there’s gonna be a lot more of those here.”

Councilman Nolan Sullivan said the city could have an “Oak Grove moment” with the project referring to the Oak Grove Apartments on the corner of South Orchard and West Monte Vista avenues that began as a “housing first” project that residents and council members were unsatisfied with and was later retooled as a senior-restricted complex that most were happy with.

“I think there’s a better location a better option we can kill multiple birds with one stone and frankly we can get everyone a better deal” he said.

Rowlett said the project may just be something that would generate money over 10 years and brushed away to allow for more biotechnology businesses but felt Corby should at least have the opportunity to return with a development agreement.

“I’m not going to sit here tonight and let these people leave when they can come and bring me maybe possibly millions of dollars…I want to hear it” he said. “If you come up and say ‘Hey all we can come up with is this’ I’m probably gonna vote no so just be aware of that. You’re gonna have to come up with something dazzling and say ‘I’m gonna get out of your way so you can have this biotech campus.”

Rowlett motioned to move the project forward to allow Corby to come up with a substantial plan but it was denied 4-3 with only himself Councilman Greg Ritchie and Councilwoman Jeanette Wylie voting in favor.

In other business since Vice Mayor Jason Roberts is running for mayor and requested another council member be appointed to serve the remainder of his vice mayor term the council unanimously voted to appoint Stockton to the position.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vbWFya2V0cy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL25ld3Mvc3RvY2tzL3R3by1wcm9taXNpbmctZXNnLWludmVzdG1lbnQtc3RvY2tzLXRvLWRyaXZlLXlvdXItcG9ydGZvbGlvLWluLTIwMjItMTAzMTcwMjc0MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Two Promising ESG Investment Stocks to Drive Your Portfolio in 2022,"What is ESG Investing?

In recent times different quarters of the market have been leaning toward socially responsible investing or sustainable investing aka environmental social and governance (ESG) investing. This approach seeks to invest in companies stocks that are having a positive impact like Xylem stock (XYL)?utm_source=markets.businessinsider.com&utm_medium=referral (GB:0M29) and NextEra Energy stock (NEE)?utm_source=markets.businessinsider.com&utm_medium=referral (GB:0K80). ESG investing considers companies focusing on sustainable development clean energy social justice or working towards mitigating climate change.

One name that has been at the forefront of this wave is Bill Gates the founder of Microsoft. Gates recently picked up shares worth $77 million in Ecolab (ECL) (GB:0IFA) which provides water hygiene and infection prevention solutions in more than 170 countries. Let us look at two promising names in the ESG space that could boost your portfolio.

Xylem is a water technology company providing solutions for optimizing water usage and resource management. Its offerings enable communities in over 150 countries to become water secure.

Its three business segments Water Infrastructure (water delivery wastewater transport and treatment) Applied Water (businesses in industrial residential and commercial building) and Measurement and Control Solutions (smart meters analytics and network technologies) are dedicated to better manage water resources.

Further Xylems efforts to decarbonize the water sector helped it bag the Net Zero Carbon Champion award at the 2022 Global Water Awards this year. Impressively its offerings prevented over 500 billion gallons of polluted water from flooding in 2021. The company also helped its clients reuse over 285 billion gallons of water last year.

Is Xylem Stock a Buy?

Four out of 13 analysts who have rated Xylem stock in the past three months think it is a Buy. Argus Research analyst John Eade has reiterated a Buy rating on XYL stock while increasing the price target to $115 from $100. This implies a 19.6% potential upside for the stock on top of the nearly 14% price gain over the past month. Overall the Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on Xylem stock alongside an average price target of $96.90.

NextEra Energy (NEE) (GB:0K80)

With a capacity of 58 GW (gigawatt) NextEra is a leading name in clean energy. It owns Florida Power & Light Company the largest electric utility in the U.S. Its clean energy unit NextEra Energy Resources is the worlds largest producer of energy from wind and sun.

NextEra bagged the S&P Global Platts 2020 Energy Transition Award for its progress on the ESG front. This year it has set the Real Zero goal to make its operations carbon emissions-free by 2045. It pegs the drive to decarbonize the U.S. economy as a $4 trillion market opportunity. NextEra plans to generate only carbon emission-free energy via a mix of solar wind green hydrogen nuclear battery storage and other renewable energy sources.

Moreover NextEra estimates reaching this goal could also create 150000 jobs and contribute $15 billion to Florida’s gross domestic product (GDP) by 2045. Whats more the company is expected to be a beneficiary of the Climate Bill.

Is Nee a Buy or Sell?

Eight out of 12 analysts who have rated NEE stock in the past three months have rated it a Buy. J.P. Morgan’s Jeremy Tonet has reiterated a Buy rating on NEE stock and sees a 20.48% potential upside based on a price target of $106. Overall the Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating with an average NextEra price target of $94.36.

Is Socially Responsible Investing Worth it?

Socially responsible or ESG investing continues to gain ground as the world witnesses the devastating and now recurrent impacts of climate change. In this dynamic both Xylem and NextEra are playing a key role in making capitalism more sustainable.

Compounded with the challenges around climate change it is evident that secure sustainable and affordable energy supplies are needed to meet future energy demands. With hydrogen dominating the discussions around clean energy transitions in recent years it prompts the question: does it truly have the potential to deliver?

The Colors of Hydrogen

Hydrogen can be produced from many routes each classified by a different color. Of the many colors the most commonly discussed are green blue grey and brown.

Green hydrogen is the most sustainable form of hydrogen as it is produced from electrolysis powered by renewable energy technologies. It differs from blue hydrogen which is made from natural gas and its carbon emissions are captured stored or reused. Hydrogen produced from natural gas or methane via steam methane reformation without the capture of emissions is grey hydrogen. Brown hydrogen is produced from thermal coal and is the cheapest to manufacture.

Almost 80% of all hydrogen is produced from emission-intensive routes such as coal gasification and natural gas reforming. With the demand for hydrogen increasing in recent years more effort is needed to reduce the emissions associated with hydrogen production. Governments worldwide are adopting hydrogen strategies to ensure that focus is placed on low-carbon hydrogen technologies.

How Does Green Hydrogen Energy Storage Work?

Hydrogen produced from electrolysis becomes ‘green’ if the process has been powered by renewable sources such as wind or solar power. Alkaline and water electrolysis are the two most prevalent routes for hydrogen production via electrolysis.

The hydrogen produced from this process can be stored and converted back to electricity when required. Green hydrogen carries great potential for energy storage because it can be burned when required without any carbon dioxide emissions or used directly in fuel cells.

Surplus renewable electricity produced during off-peak periods can power electrolyzer plants to make hydrogen. This hydrogen can then become a store of carbon-free energy converted back to electricity when demands peak and provide balancing power for the grid.

Paul Schultz of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power shares that it is a technology that can do seasonal storage. “All of this amount of over-generation that you potentially have in the spring and the fall can be used when you are renewable resource-poor during the summer and the winter” added Schultz.

The Current State of Hydrogen Energy Storage

The process known as “power-to-gas-to-power” has lower efficiency and is more expensive than other storage technologies. However it still receives significant interest due to its high energy storage capacity. Hydrogen can be stored for months without losing power through discharge compared to other technologies. Lithium-ion batteries empty within hours by comparison.

Despite higher costs than natural gas organizations such as German utility Uniper are interested in investing in the technology.

Uniper hopes to use renewable electricity produced daily to make hydrogen for underground storage. The hydrogen could then be traded sold to industrial users or used to generate electricity supplied back to the grid.

NextEra the largest US utility by market capitalization is also a significant investor in the technology with 50 potential green hydrogen projects in the pipeline. President of NextEra Energy Resources John Ketchum said “we see hydrogen as a really long-term solution.”

Although progress is being made by some companies and organizations the International Energy Agency (IEA) recognizes that the widespread use of green hydrogen still faces several challenges. High production costs the slow development of hydrogen infrastructure and regulatory limits on developing a clean hydrogen industry are barriers to the widespread adoption of green hydrogen.

Is Green Hydrogen the Future of Energy Storage?

Long-term energy storage will become a focus as renewables become more prominent players in the energy mix. Volatile energy markets make it more important than ever to ensure that considered and sustainable decisions are made to avoid catastrophic climate change.

Hydrogen has great potential and is a leading option for long-term energy storage in the future as identified by the IEA. Many proponents also consider hydrogen the answer to achieving a circular economy.

To truly harness and take advantage of green hydrogen energy storage solutions in the future the barriers to widespread clean hydrogen adoption should first be addressed.

Although hydrogen is currently experiencing growing support politically and in the business world it is clear that there is still much to be done before green hydrogen is produced and adopted at scale. To achieve this coordinated and comprehensive strategies need to be put in place by industrial leaders and decision-makers to scale up technologies and bring production costs down so that green hydrogen can be produced economically securely and at scale.

The brand has partnered with global creative company Buck to bring a WebAR experience to 11 of its stores around the world including those in New York City Paris and Shanghai. The project aims to highlight the spirit of DNA (Department of Nike Archives) and support the future of storytelling within the retail space.

Visitors can unlock the experience by using their smartphone’s camera as a QR scanner. Each of the 11 augmented reality experiences is contained within a QR box designed to mimic frosted glass as to heighten the AR’s reveal and entice users to engage with each story. Accented with orange rims the boxes virtually open up when scanned with a smartphone revealing an array of Nike artifacts that visitors can explore through gestures and display cues.

What’s in store — In total 17 pieces from Nike’s archive are included in the project. Vintage apparel waffle-sole sneakers and the brand’s legendary Mercurial cleats are just some of the products that visitors can explore with in-depth descriptions and interactive augmented reality features. Through the virtual display users can view the archival pieces in detail and from multiple angles.

To make each artifact compatible with the real-time augmented reality experience Buck optimized a combination of 3D scanning WebAR and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technology. WebAR allows for lightweight AR experiences supported by a web browser or any modern smartphone making augmented reality accessible to most users. SLAM enhances the display by spatially anchoring objects in front of the user allowing them to walk around each Nike artifact as though it were truly present. Each feature brings a “crucial” sense of awe and immersion to the experience a press release states.

He was a savvy businessman with incredible attention to detail. Thanks to his relentless work ethic the Los Angeles Lakers legend rewrote the history books while simultaneously revolutionizing performance basketball shoes.

Bryant's sneaker legacy is mainly remembered for his time with Nike. But what if he never left Adidas? It is easier to say what would not have happened rather than what would have occurred. But today we will try to answer both questions.

Adidas Kobe Brand

Adidas Crazy 1 'Stormtrooper' adidas

Following the Lakers' third consecutive NBA Championship in 2002 Bryant and his agent Rob Pelinka made a trip to Germany to meet with Adidas executives. In the book Showboat: The Life of Kobe Bryant author Roland Lazenby detailed a terse meeting between the two parties.

Adidas laid out its vision for the Kobe line which included sneakers and clothing. But the 23-year-old was uninterested. According to The Wall Street Journal Bryant paid $8 million to get out of the remainder of his Adidas contract.

Bryant's decision to leave Adidas changed the course of sneaker history. Had the perennial NBA All-Star stayed with Adidas it is easy to envision Bryant getting his own brand. Similar to Michael Jordan with Nike or Stephen Curry with Under Armour.

For better or for worse we will never know. But now we can move on to important moments that absolutely would not have gone down if Bryant never signed with Nike.

Sneaker Free Agency

Bryant had to wait one year before signing a contract with a new company. So while the biggest sneaker free agent of all time met with potential business partners off the court he tried out everything on the court.

Bryant wore a wide array of basketball shoes during the 2002-03 NBA season. Over the course of 82 games Bryant wore 65 pairs of Air Jordans. Additionally he mixed in And1 Converse Nike and Reebok shoes during that memorable season.

It goes without saying that we would have never gotten the iconic images of Bryant competing against Jordan in different pairs of Air Jordans. There have been plenty of sneaker free agents over the past two decades but there will never be another one as important as Bryant.

Low Top Shoes

Isaiah Thomas wears the Nike Kobe 4 'NBA Final MVP' Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports

After the launch of the Nike Kobe line Bryant wore shoes that were normal for the time. The first three Nike Kobes were high-tops and used heavy materials. Those early shoes are still popular but Bryant once again made history when he demanded low-cut basketball shoes.

Inspired by futbol boots (soccer cleats in America) Bryant wanted an ultra-minimalist basketball shoe. Not only did Nike shave off unnecessary material but they began implementing its newest technology on the Kobe line.

Leather gradually took a backseat to wire and knit materials. The Nike Kobes 4-11 all became lighter and revolutionized performance basketball footwear. Perhaps the low-top resolution could have still happened under Adidas but it is impossible to say.

Commercials

Fans can entertain the GOAT debate or even argue who has the best signature line. But there is no denying that Bryant had the best commercials. Even his Adidas commercials perfectly balanced sincerity with comedic moments.

But the Nike commercials featuring Bryant reached new heights. Ankle Insurance MVPuppets and the Kobe System are three of the best advertisements for basketball shoes of all time.

Protros

Following Bryant's retirement in 2016 Nike shifted the direction of the Kobe line. The following October Nike introduced the Kobe AD line which marked a new era in Bryant's role with the company.

Despite initial reservations Bryant agreed to Nike re-releasing his older shoes. But under one condition the retro basketball shoes incorporate new technology. Thus the 'Protro' line was born in 2018.

Since that time all of the other major brands have followed suit. But at the time it was a new strategy. Bryant truly was inventive and Nike was the perfect partner to execute the superstar's vision. It is fun to dream of what could have been if Bryant stuck with Adidas but it's hard to imagine a better outcome than the path he took with Nike.

Nike tops the list thanks to its December 2021 acquisition of RTFKT a purveyor of digital goods. RTFKT has since joined the Nike family of brands sitting alongside the likes of Converse SB and Jordan.

At the time of purchase RTFKT was estimated to be worth around $33 million; however internet rumors estimated its purchase to be north of $1 billion.

Regardless of the price Nike's investment is looking to be a wise one. Levine's chart asserts that Nike made over $185 million off of RTFKT NFT sales this year alone.

To put this in comparison in 2021 Jordan Brand alone earned Nike $4.7 billion in revenue all of which came from primary sales (eg: a customer pays Nike directly for a pair of Jordans).

This is only a fraction of how much value the Jordan brand actually creates as secondary resellers (eg: StockX resale stores) will upcharge anywhere between double to 10 times the original retail price. It’s estimated however that this price fluctuation only impacts a very small sought-after group of sneakers with an estimated total resale market (including other brands like Reebok adidas and New Balance) of about $6 billion as of 2019.

Meanwhile RTFKT did $1.29 billion — including $92 million in royalties — in secondary/resale volume prior to the acquisition. Combined with the $93 million in primary RTFKT sales Nike captured the same volume in product sales from its secondary and primary markets for the very first time.

Although RTFKT and Nike have a ways to go before topping the $4.7 billion in revenue generated by Jordan Brand they’re going to be able to catch up quickly with secondary market sales of their NFT sneakers and hoodies.

After all if Jordan accounts for even 30% of the estimated $6 billion in resale I mentioned earlier it'd be able to factor an additional $1.8 billion into its revenue. Not only is RTFKT already capturing that resale value but its secondary market has the potential to grow bigger with every drop rapidly generating royalties for the lifetime of Nike-created NFTs.

Outside of Nike Levine's chart reveals that other brands have seen some interesting results for primary versus resale value which can help partially explain some of the volatility in the perpetually fluctuating NFT market.

Although troubled brand Dolce & Gabbana came in at #2 — mirroring its rising fashion demand — these results were driven by primary sales of its ""Boxes"" project that many users on the Highsnobiety Discord described as a clunky drop belying the high price.

Launched in April D&G's Boxes NFTs could only be purchased through third-party site UNXD with wETH on Polygon then were then airdropped to your ETH wallet several days later (a complicated process even for so-called ""NFT people""). D&G only recently announced physical Boxes goods for token holders stemming several weeks of the NFTs' falling prices and secondary sales.

Meanwhile Tiffany & Co.’s CryptoPunks jewelry collection sold out immediately pinning the company at #3 with high-traffic high-price IRL utility.

Gucci’s partnership with SUPERPLASTIC helped contribute to the Kering-owned house landing at #4. However its secondary volume had been following a similar pattern to Dolce & Gabbana until the final installment of its SUPERGUCCI project.

Besides Nike Adidas has arguably had the most consistent success by trade volume in primary and secondary markets. Its masterful partnerships with Bored Ape Yacht Club and gmoney may have the Three Stripes at #5 but its relevance as an NFT mastermind has held strong even through the so-called crypto winter.

Rounding out the fashion brands of the top 10 Lacoste placed at #9. Although its UNDW3 project only just launched this summer it's had a great showing thus far.

As more brands enter web3 it's clear even with this early showing that those who provide the most utility to token holders are consistently rewarded financially. Whether it's Adidas 'forging' tokens for exclusive merch or CryptoPunk holders being the only ones able to buy $50k Tiffany pendants the name of the game is quality rewards. However this is why Nike is a different beast altogether.

When you consider that Nike now has the strongest head start of any brand in NFTs the added utility they offer to RTFKT NFT holders is endless. An exclusive party with Drake? You got it. Tickets to the Super Bowl? No problem. The latest pair of Jordans? Already being shipped. Any one of these moves could bolster RTFKT's secondary market overnight while Nike reaps royalties on every single payment.

People used to say it was dumb to spend $1k+ on a pair of shoes but kicks are now classed as perfectly reasonable alternative assets. The same might be said about RTFKT NFTs with the biggest difference being that Nike gets a cut of every sale. This begs the question: what does Nike see as a bigger earner long-term sneakers or NFTs?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtlbnR1Y2t5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzL2FydGljbGUyNjQ4MDYyNjQuaHRtbNIBPGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmtlbnR1Y2t5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzL2FydGljbGUyNjQ4MDYyNjQuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lexington shopping news: New members-only store coming to the Summit at Fritz Farm,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.kentucky.com', port=443): Read timed out.

The Biden-appointed board recommended a settlement that would contain wage increases well below inflation eliminate caps on individual contributions to health care and worst of all leave intact the hated attendance policies that management has used to drive tens of thousands out of the industry.

Out of the 120-plus-page document one section has been singled out in particular by railroaders for scorn. During hearings before the board on wages according to the PEB report the railroads argued that labor from railroad workers does not contribute to their profits. “The Carriers maintain that capital investment and risk are the reasons for their profits not any contributions from labor” the PEB report said. “The Carriers assert that since employees have been fairly and adequately paid for their efforts… then they have no claim to share in the [profits].”

The statement sums up the total contempt that management feels for railroad workers who have turned it into a catchphrase. Workers have printed it on t-shirts left flyers with the offending sentence in break rooms and shared memes about it on social media.

The claim by the railroads that “labor does not contribute to profits” which has sparked outrage among railroad workers stamped onto the back of a Norfolk Southern safety vest [Photo: Railroad worker via Reddit]

The rail companies know the claim is absurd and self-contradictory. After all if labor did not contribute to profits what objection could there be to workers carrying out a national strike? Indeed why would the Railway Labor Act in force since 1926 to block strike action through endless mediation and “cooling off periods” exist at all? More importantly if their profits bear no relationship to the socially-useful work of railroad workers in moving goods across the country what social justification can there be for profits themselves? The statement is a declaration that the railroad companies and their owners function as social parasites making billions while contributing nothing of value to society.

However from an economic standpoint the railroads’ claim is totally false. The reaction to the provocative claim shows that workers instinctively grasp this but it was proven scientifically more than 150 years ago by Karl Marx in his seminal 1867 work Capital. On the basis of his extensive critical analysis of the economic and social laws underlying the capitalist system of economy Marx founded modern socialism which is based on scientific laws of development of the class struggle.

Labor and the origin of surplus value

Marx’s Capital begins with an analysis of the commodity the cell form of the capitalist system in which all its development is rooted. In societies where the capitalist mode of production prevails he wrote wealth presents itself as an ‘accumulation of commodities’—from industrial products means of communication entertainment etc to all the basic necessities of life—which are bought and sold on the market.

Marx begins by an examination of the laws of commodity production as the basis for his analysis of capitalism. The value of any commodity (a phone a car etc.) is determined by the socially necessary labor needed to produce it. That is commodities that require the same amount of labor to produce have the same value and are exchanged as equivalents in the market.

In the transition to capitalist society which develops out of simple commodity production an epoch-making change takes place. This happens when labor power or the capacity to work becomes a commodity likewise bought and sold on the market.

But if according to the laws of commodity production equivalents are exchanged for equivalents how does an additional or surplus value (profit) arise as it clearly does in capitalist society?

Of course an individual may be able to sell for one reason or another a commodity above its value and he will gain in the exchange. But there will be no creation of additional value in society as a whole because one individual’s gain is another’s loss—a zero-sum game.

The answer to this question lay in the examination of the new commodity labor power the capacity to work which forms the basis of social relations in capitalist society.

The value of the commodity labor power is determined by the value of the commodities needed to reproduce it—that is the value of the commodities needed to keep the worker alive and continuing to work including food clothing shelter etc. and to raise a family and produce the next generation of wage workers.

But the particular usefulness of this commodity labor power is its ability to create new value out of the labor of the worker. The value that a worker adds to the productive process in a given day is equal to more than the value that goes to wages. A worker for example may need only work for four hours in a day in order to reproduce the value that was spent on his or her wages. But this fact does not keep the capitalist from keeping the worker on the job for eight 12 or even 16 hours a day. This surplus value the difference between the value of the workers’ wages and the value of the goods and services he or she produces over the course of a working day is the source of all profits.

Marx’s discovery of the origins of surplus value was revolutionary in the most literal sense of the word. It showed how the apparent free exchange of equivalents in the market including the exchange of labor power for wages concealed in actual fact a system of class exploitation. While the working class produces all surplus value this surplus is expropriated by the capitalist. The worker who himself owns no factories railroads mines or other means of production is forced to sell his labor power to the capitalist in order to survive.

Even though they deny that workers’ labor is the source of their profits the statement by the railroads that workers are not entitled to share in profits because they “have been fairly and adequately paid for their efforts” is essentially a paraphrase of what Marx said from a critical standpoint about capitalist exploitation.

Since its discovery the law of surplus value has formed the core of the socialist understanding of the class struggle and the inevitability of socialist revolution. Tracing the history and forms of surplus value accumulation—that is the economic history of modern society and next to it the conflict between the working class and the capitalist class—Marx and subsequent generations of socialists concluded that the working class the basic creative and progressive force in capitalist society would eventually be compelled to take political power expropriate the expropriators and reorganize economy in the interest of human need not private profit.

This historical turning point would be reached when the capitalist system and the profit motive are no longer compatible with the further development of human civilization—as Marx said when “the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production.”

Financialization and the railroads

The fact that the railroads feel compelled in the course of the defense of their “right” to unlimited profits to dispense with the usual corporate nonsense about “family” and “shared sacrifice” and flatly deny the right of workers to share in their profits is one symptom that society has reached this point. The railroads as is now widely acknowledged are a shambles with constant delays and safety issues a daily reality. But the railroads are also the most profitable industry in America “earning” a margin of more than 50 percent in 2019.

The denial of the labor theory of value is aimed in the first place at concealing the origin of this profit in railroaders’ constant 70 hour workweeks 24/7 on-call status missed children’s birthday parties and sports games as well as massive levels of overwork redundancies and dangerous working conditions. Workers however feel the truth from their own bitter personal experiences. As Marx put it “Accumulation of wealth at one pole is therefore at the same time accumulation of misery agony of toil slavery ignorance brutality mental degradation at the opposite pole.”

But the railroads’ statement that “labor does not contribute to profits” is also significant as a frank admission of the parasitic outlook of the super-wealthy individuals and Wall Street hedge funds that own the industry. They see the value of wages as simply a drain on their profits to be reduced as close to zero as possible. This is what is behind for example the longstanding push by the railroads for greater automation and the imposition of one-man crews (and at some point after zero-man crews).

As Marx explained the production of goods and services—such as the maintenance of a functioning reliable rail network—is for the capitalist only a means to an end as a source of profit but one which always entails considerable “risk” as the railroads frankly state. The capitalist aversion to this “risk” produces continual attempts to free themselves from the productive process entirely and instead make money purely out of money through various forms of financial parasitism.

One example of this is the use of $70 billion by the railroads to finance share buybacks in order to artificially inflate their stock prices. Indeed the railway industry itself functions for its owners as little more than a piggy bank. The billions made off the backs of workers are plugged into Wall Street.

This “fictitious capital”—securities stocks credit default swaps and financial swindling of all kinds—appears to violate the law of surplus value by producing profit seemingly out of thin air. In reality this mountain of fictitious capital is a claim on future value to be created by and extracted from the working class. If there is even the expectation by investors that this value in adequate quantities will not be forthcoming then the entire financial house of cards could come crashing down.

Railroaders and the fight against capitalism

As of this writing the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently at 32909.59. Two years ago in the opening weeks of the pandemic when much of the working class was at home under lockdown the Dow fell by more than 10000 points until Congress intervened to bail out Wall Street with a multi-trillion-dollar rescue package. But the bailout while creating massive new reservoirs of fictitious capital on the stock market did not create a single cent in new value—that still needs to be paid for through a massive ramping up of exploitation of workers. Indeed the first reopenings began shortly after the bailout was passed.

As bad as things have gotten for workers in the US and worldwide over the past four decades the law of surplus value compels the capitalist class to make it much worse reducing workers to the level of industrial slaves. This is being organized by the Biden administration with the support of both parties. His top domestic priority is the reining in of wage growth even though it has not come close to keeping pace with inflation by jacking up interest rates to drive up unemployment.

The most “pro-union president in American history” is also conspiring with the trade union bureaucracy which owns tens of billions in financial assets itself giving it a stake in the exploitation of its own members to suppress wage growth enforce substandard contracts and prevent the outbreak of strikes particularly in critical industries such as the railroads the docks the airlines oil and gas and others.

This is to be supplemented through a renewed upsurge of imperial plunder forcibly acquiring new markets and sources of raw materials at the expense of its chief rivals Russia and China. This and not any insincere concern for the sovereignty of Ukraine or Taiwan is what is propelling the US to risk World War III.

Battle lines are being drawn across the country and around the world. By whom and in whose interest will society be run? On one side stands not only the RLA but the White House and Congress and with them the pro-corporate trade union bureaucracy. For the “good of the economy” that is for profits and so as not to disrupt their war plans they cannot stand by and allow railroaders to strike. They will use every means at their disposal to either prevent or suppress it.

On the other side stand the railroaders with the support of the working class around the country and the world. Indeed workers all over the world are rising up against runaway inflation and brutal working conditions. In Britain the first national rail strikes in decades have taken place this summer. A strike on the US railroads would have an electrifying effect among workers around the world.

But for a struggle on the railroads to succeed workers must know what they are up against and steel themselves against any illusions. Railroaders must draw the necessary conclusions. They are not just locked in a fight for “fair wages” against particularly greedy railroad corporations but against the capitalist system of exploitation itself. The railroads themselves in both words and in action are proving this to be true.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vYWZsY2lvLm9yZy8yMDIyLzgvMjQvZnJlaWdodC1yYWlscm9hZC13b3JrZXItc3Rvcmllcy1icmFuZG9uLXJlZG1hbi10d3XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Freight Railroad Worker Stories: Brandon Redman of TWU,"Today’s story comes from Brandon Redman of the Transport Workers Union (TWU). He works as a freight car repairman/inspector for Norfolk Southern in Elkhart Indiana.



Redman said: “When I was hired in 2009 we had 80 Carmen out there. Now we have just around 50. So you have less people doing the same amount of work or even more work given the increased freight demand.



“There have been several instances in the last few years where the same Carman has been forced to work 16-hour shifts on four or five days in the same week. There is no way a person can be rested for an additional shift without having some sort of a heads-up of more than an hour.



“When you take into account all the additional responsibilities in life such as driving to and from work securing food for you and your family paying bills child care hygiene and so on it is impossible to be rested for duty and be safe at work with forced 16-hour work days let alone with no notice.



“That’s just unsafe and it creates a real problem. The continued grind by the Carmen that haven't quit yet has taken a real toll.



“When I was hired in 2009 there were 10 to 12 inspectors working in the rail yard every shift. Now there's only six per shift. But the freight hasn't declined. In fact it's increased. So you have more freight less inspectors and quicker inspection times and obviously it's not sustainable.



“At the end of the day if we were properly staffed there would be safe and rested employees; proper inspections; safer trains and freight cars traveling the country; and greater employee retention.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxM21lbXBoaXMuY29tL25ld3MvdHJlbmRpbmcvaHVsay1hLW1hbmlhLWxvdS1mZXJyaWduby1uYW1lZC1ob25vcmFyeS1zeXJhY3VzZS1wb2xpY2Utb2ZmaWNlci9hcnRpY2xlX2VmYjM2ZGNkLThkN2QtNWUxOS04NGEwLTU0MDc3ZGZmZDEyNi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hulk-a-mania: Lou Ferrigno named honorary Syracuse police officer,"Memphis TN (38111)

2. About the data

The sources for the data contained in this release are Departmental Information Returns and the DoH Inpatient and Outpatient Waiting Times Datasets. These returns collect information from HSC Trusts on a quarterly basis.

Figures will also include privately funded patients waiting to be seen/for treatment in Health Service hospitals and those patients who are resident outside Northern Ireland.

Data incorporate all returns and amendments received from HSC Trusts up to 19 August 2022.

Outpatient definitions

An outpatient appointment is an appointment to enable a patient to see a consultant a member of their team or a locum for such a member in respect of one referral.

The waiting list figures include all outpatients who have not had their first appointments by the end of the quarter including those who have cancelled or missed a previous appointment.

The outpatient waiting list figures presented do not include maternity specialties 501 (Obstetrics) 510 (Obstetrics (Ante Natal)) and 520 (Obstetrics (Post Natal)).

Patients waiting for cataract treatment (Ophthalmology) can now be seen at a Day Case Procedure Centre at Mid-Ulster hospital.

Inpatient and Day Case definitions

Inpatient admissions include both (a) patients admitted electively with the expectation that they will remain in hospital for at least one night and (b) non-elective admissions (e.g. emergency admissions). A patient who is admitted with either of the above intentions but who leaves hospital for any reason without staying overnight is still counted as an ordinary admission. The figures in this statistics release only include non-emergency admissions.

Day Cases are patients admitted electively during the course of a day with the intention of receiving care who do not require the use of a hospital bed overnight and who return home as scheduled. If this original intention is not fulfilled and the patient stays overnight such a patient is counted as an ordinary admission.

The waiting list figures presented include people waiting to be admitted as inpatients either as day cases or inpatient admissions. They do not include: Patients admitted as emergency cases; Outpatients; Patients undergoing a planned programme of treatment e.g. a series of admissions for chemotherapy; Maternity (specialties 510 and 520); Patients currently receiving inpatient treatment in hospitals but who are included on other waiting lists; Patients who are temporarily suspended from waiting lists.



Diagnostic Service definitions

A diagnostic service provides an examination test or procedure used to identify a person’s disease or condition and which allows a medical diagnosis to be made.

The diagnostic waiting list figures presented include people waiting for a test with a diagnostic element including tests that are part diagnostic and subsequently part therapeutic. They do not include:

Patients currently admitted to a hospital bed and waiting for an emergency procedure; Purely therapeutic procedures. A therapeutic procedure is defined as a procedure which involves actual treatment of a person’s disease condition or injury; Patients undergoing a planned programme of tests; Patients waiting for procedures as part of a screening programme.



Diagnostic Reporting Times definitions

The diagnostic reporting turnaround time is the length of time between the diagnostic test being undertaken and the results being verified and dispatched to the referring clinician.

Diagnostic reporting times apply to a selected subset of diagnostic services. These services are: Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Computerised Tomography; Non-Obstetric Ultrasound; Plain Film X-rays; Barium Studies; DEXA Scan; Radionuclide Imaging; Pure Tone Audiometry; Echocardiography; Perfusion Studies; Peripheral Neurophysiology; Sleep Studies; and Urodynamics Pressures and Flows.

NOC,Northrop Grumman,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5ub3J0aHJvcGdydW1tYW4uY29tL25ld3MvZmVhdHVyZXMvbm9ydGhyb3AtZ3J1bW1hbi1jb250aW51ZXMtYi0yLXNwaXJpdC1tb2Rlcm5pemF0aW9u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Northrop Grumman Continues B-2 Spirit Modernization | Northrop Grumman,"Northrop Grumman and the U.S. Air Force are continuing enhancements to the B-2 Spirit Stealth bomber fleet providing new capability including its first long-range stealth missile.

Northrop Grumman aircrew inspect the B-2 Spirit of Arizona before take-off in Palmdale California.

The B-2 successfully released a Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile – Extended Range (JASSM-ER) during a flight test in December. The JASSM-ER further enhances the B-2’s ability to hit any target anywhere. The integration of JASSM-ER enables the delivery of a low observable asset capable of traveling greater distances than its predecessor.

JASSM-ER is one of three new advanced capabilities being introduced to the B-2 to further modernize the platform. The B-2 fleet capable of delivering both conventional and nuclear ordnance is also integrating crypto modernization and a Radar Aided Targeting System (RATS). The latest system advancements are part of integrated functional capability (IFC) P6.4 which was certified last year by the Air Force. RATS will complete the latest phase of nuclear modernization of the B-2 Spirit.

“The unrivaled capabilities of the B-2 make it the only long range penetrating stealth bomber currently in the U.S. arsenal” said Shaugnessy Reynolds vice president and B-2 program manager Northrop Grumman. “Committed to continued modernization of the B-2 we’re leveraging our company’s innovation in digital engineering and its decades of leadership in designing and maintaining low observable platforms to keep the B-2 Spirit mission ready.”

The integration of RATS allows the B-2 to fully employ the B-61 mod 12 nuclear bomb. RATS is the key element of the nuclear modernization as GPS may not be available during a bomber task force mission.

Crypto modernization further improves the communications security of various high frequency transmissions. The B-2 may now securely utilize advanced communication devices in the future threat environment. Earlier this year Northrop Grumman conducted a successful communications flight test with modern cryptology at its Oklahoma City Weapons System Support Center site.

The capabilities of this IFC continue to position the B-2 fleet as a key component of the Department of Defense’s nuclear triad. It is also part of Northrop Grumman’s ongoing modernization efforts leveraging 21st century technology incorporating digital engineering.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5ub3J0aHJvcGdydW1tYW4uY29tL25ld3MvcmVsZWFzZXMvbm9ydGhyb3AtZ3J1bW1hbnMtcnEtNC1yYW5nZWhhd2tzLWVtYmFyay1vbi1uZXctbWlzc2lvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Northrop Grumman's RQ-4 RangeHawks Embark on New Mission,"Previously designated Block 30 Global Hawks will support SkyRange program

GRAND FORKS N.D. – Aug. 24 2022 – Northrop Grumman Corporation’s (NYSE: NOC) RQ-4 RangeHawk is poised to support the SkyRange program’s U.S. hypersonic missile flight tests from its Grand Sky facility near Grand Forks North Dakota. SkyRange is the Department of Defense Test Resource Management Center’s (TRMC) unmanned high-altitude long-endurance responsive mobile flight test system

In support of the SkyRange initiative Block 20 and 30 RQ-4B Global Hawk aircraft are being transferred to TRMC to be reconfigured into RangeHawks. The conversion will integrate advanced payloads to equip the aircraft with the capability to support the testing of hypersonic vehicles and other long-range weapons. RangeHawks provide over-the-horizon altitude endurance and flexibility which are critical for collecting telemetry and other data to monitor the vehicle during flight tests. Increasing the capacity of hypersonic vehicle testing furthers research and development necessary to remain competitive in the global landscape.

“Our RQ-4 RangeHawks will support the emerging class of hypersonic weapons and provide a combination of range endurance and payload capacity” said Jane Bishop vice president and general manager global surveillance Northrop Grumman. “These aircraft will continue their role in vital national security missions while enabling us to bring premier aircraft design modification operations and sustainment work to the Grand Forks community.”

While previous testing relied on ship-based sensors RangeHawks can perform such missions with fewer assets reducing cost and complexity. RangeHawks are equipped with sensors to demonstrate an alternative data-collection support system to test hypersonic systems and have participated in several hypersonic test events in the Pacific and elsewhere.

“SkyRange will enable the Department of Defense to accelerate our pace of testing hypersonic systems” said George Rumford acting director and principal deputy TRMC. “Northrop Grumman’s RangeHawk is ideally suited to collect data by providing persistent time-on-station positioned closer to flight path and agility to adapt to the dynamics of a testing environment – a force multiplier as we evolve critical national security capabilities.”

Northrop Grumman is also managing operations and sustainment of the RQ-4A RangeHawk prototype fleet in partnership with NASA at Armstrong Flight Research Center at Edwards Air Force Base along with integrating new payloads for the future RQ-4B RangeHawk fleet.

Northrop Grumman supports many systems critical to connecting each service across multiple domains while advancing aeronautics to help ensure defense forces stay ahead of adversaries. As a proven pioneer in autonomous systems Northrop Grumman’s current and future platforms are revolutionary in deterring and engaging adversaries on the battlefield.

Northrop Grumman is a technology company focused on global security and human discovery. Our pioneering solutions equip our customers with capabilities they need to connect advance and protect the U.S. and its allies.

A B-2 bomber successfully released a long-range cruise missile during a weapons test in December 2021 contractor Northrop Grumman revealed Aug. 25 potentially giving the stealth bomber the ability to strike even deeper into contested areas.

The Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range or JASSM-ER has a range of more than 500 miles and has been integrated onto the B-1B and B-52 bombers and F-15E and F-16 fighters according to Pentagon budget documents.

The December test on the B-2 however marks the first publicly known instance of the Air Force testing the JASSM-ER on a stealth aircraft—there are plans to integrate the missile onto the F-35A as well.

The B-2 has already completed testing with the missile’s shorter-range variant the JASSM.

“The JASSM-ER further enhances the B-2’s ability to hit any target anywhere” Northrop Grumman’s press release states. “The integration of JASSM-ER enables the delivery of a low observable asset capable of traveling greater distances than its predecessor.”

The baseline version of JASSM has a range of roughly 200 miles. Not only can JASSM-ER fly more than twice that far future versions will allow it to ​​re-target midflight.

Northrop Grumman provided no other details as to where the test occurred or why it took so long to publicly announce it and the Air Force did not immediately respond to queries from Air Force Magazine.

The successful JASSM-ER test was just one of three modernization efforts Northrop Grumman announced. The contractor also said it has integrated the new Radar Aided Targeting System onto the bomber.

The Air Force had previously announced a successful test of the system which improves weapon guidance accuracy in a GPS-denied environment in July. Northrop Grumman noted that the system allows the B-2 to fully use the B61 Mod 12 the latest version of the thermonuclear bomb.

Northrop Grumman also announced that it has installed modern cryptology on the B-2 giving the bomber more secure communications at “various high frequency transmissions.” The new cryptology was tested “earlier this year” in a flight from the contractor’s Oklahoma City facility.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3Jlc3BvbnNpYmxlc3RhdGVjcmFmdC5vcmcvMjAyMi8wOC8yNC9zZWNyZXRpdmUtbmV4dC1nZW4tZmlnaHRlci1wcm9ncmFtLXJhaXNlcy1jb25jZXJucy1hYm91dC1vdmVyc2lnaHQtc3BlbmRpbmctcHJpb3JpdGllcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Pentagon wants to keep this new multibillion dollar plane a secret,"Late last week the Air Force awarded five identical contracts each valued at nearly $1 billion. The press release was light on details but it gave some of the first concrete information about the service’s largest classified initiative: the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program which is expected to deliver the Pentagon’s first sixth-generation fighter jet.

The agreements will more than double the $4.2 billion that Congress has allocated for the program since 2015. And investment in the initiative is expected to grow further as prototype development continues with the Air Force estimating that the program will cost $11.7 billion from 2024 to 2027.

As costs rise experts say the NGAD’s secretive nature raises serious concerns about the public’s ability to exercise oversight of the program.

“We know very little of it because the Pentagon leaders decided that they weren’t going to make the same mistake that they did with the F-35” Dan Grazier a senior defense policy fellow at the Project on Government Oversight said referencing the Pentagon’s controversial fifth-generation fighter jet. “They don’t want to be raked over the coals like they [were] with the F-35 program so they’re keeping this as secret as possible.”

A recent report from the Congressional Research Service shed some light on the initiative though details remain sparse. What we do know is that the NGAD will include a new fighter jet but it may also comprise other aircraft designed to assist the main plane.

As the name implies the goal of the initiative is to field a system that can establish “air dominance.” According to CRS part of the program’s goal is to figure out exactly what that would mean. One possibility is that the fighter jet will be bigger and less agile than its predecessors with a laser weapon attached that “could ensure that no enemy flies in a large amount of airspace.”

Last week’s deals went to five defense giants including Raytheon Technologies Lockheed Martin Boeing and Northrop Grumman — the four largest weapons contractors on earth. The fifth went to General Electric a leading engine maker. The Pentagon says these contracts are part of the Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion program which will design the NGAD’s engine.

Observers say there are two possible reasons for DoD’s decision to give out so many competing contracts. First companies tend to do better when you force them to compete against each other in designing prototypes.

“It is best practice to have a competitive prototyping process” Grazier said. This approach was particularly effective in the case of the mid-century Lightweight Fighter program in which dueling prototypes eventually turned into the F-16 and the F-18 two remarkably effective planes.

But that process can only succeed if it has a sound concept at its core according to Grazier. In the case of the Littoral Combat Ship the Navy dumped $30 billion into two different designs for a poorly conceived overly complicated vessel. After only a few years in service the Pentagon has already started to retire the LCS due to myriad technical issues.

Given that the NGAD fighter jet is expected to cost “multiple hundreds of millions” of dollars per plane — far more than even the F-35 — Grazier worries that the design may include the sort of high-tech bells and whistles that have a tendency to break down leaving planes grounded for extended periods of time. (Space-age planes like the F-35 and Osprey have been plagued by such issues reducing combat readiness and making it difficult for pilots to get flight hours.)

The second reason for doling out concurrent contracts is more controversial. As Defense One recently reported the agreements are aimed in part at keeping defense giants “viable to build aircraft for years to come.”

Grazier argues that there is some logic to this. “It’s important to maintain a robust industrial base” he said noting that the United States benefits from having so many domestic manufacturers that can compete for big contracts.

But many wonder if government support for defense primes is the best use of taxpayer money. “This is something that we don’t see for any other industry in this way” said Lindsay Koshgarian the director of the National Priorities Project at the Institute for Policy Studies.

“We’ve just now […] seen a promise of the first investment in renewable energy in a big way from the Inflation Reduction Act but that’s the first time” Koshgarian continued adding that funding for climate security issues “doesn’t nearly amount to how much we’re putting into the military industrial base.”

At the end of the day it’s going to be hard to tell if the NGAD is worth the investment unless the DoD becomes less secretive about the program. The recent CRS report noted that some lawmakers “have expressed concern that developing a major classified program like NGAD risks increased costs and development issues due to limited oversight.” But it remains to be seen whether those unnamed members of Congress will fight to get more information out.

In the meantime Koshgarian expects that the program’s cost will continue to grow.

“The track record of things like this is that the costs tend to go up over time as they invest more and ramp up production” she said. “I think we can expect that if they continue with this we'll see even higher dollar amounts going in.”"
NCLH,Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL2FsYXNrYXB1YmxpYy5vcmcvMjAyMi8wOC8yNC9ub3J3ZWdpYW4tY3J1aXNlLWxpbmUtaXMtZ2l2aW5nLWEtanVuZWF1LXdhdGVyZnJvbnQtcGFyY2VsLXRvLWh1bmEtdG90ZW0tYWZ0ZXItYnV5aW5nLWl0LWZvci0yMG0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Norwegian Cruise Line is giving a Juneau waterfront parcel to Huna Totem after buying it for $20M,"Part of the Juneau waterfront area known as the subport on Aug. 23 2022. (Claire Stremple/KTOO)

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings spent $20 million for nearly three acres of prime waterfront property in 2018 beating out the City and Borough and Juneau and other bidders with an offer that was more than five times the appraised value of the land.

Yesterday Norwegian gave that property to Huna Totem Corporation an Alaska Native corporation tied to Hoonah that’s headquartered in Juneau.

Norwegian shared its ideas for the property in 2020 but it hasn’t been developed yet. Huna Totem plans to work with Juneau-based Goldbelt Inc. and other Alaska Native corporations to complete the project.

“This is an astonishing gift for Juneau and our Goldbelt shareholders” said Goldbelt President and CEO McHugh Pierre in a press release. “Giving ownership back to the Tlingit people is a tremendous way to honor the culture of this community.”

Mickey Richardson Huna Totem’s head of marketing and public relations said the corporation likes to invest in local projects and the majority of its shareholders live in Juneau.

“Being locally owned and operated we hope that the project will reflect the values of the Native people from Juneau and also the community of Juneau” he said.

The corporation aims to submit plans to local planning officials for a tourism facility and dock by the end of the year. Richardson said the goal is to complete the project for the 2025 cruise season.

Alexandra Pierce Juneau’s tourism director says the change is unlikely to lead to an overhaul of Norwegian’s concept.

“We have been told that they’re planning to maintain the core elements as presented to the community: the underground parking public open space and ocean center” she said. “But we haven’t seen a revised plan yet.”

Pierce has worked with Norwegian on its plans since the company purchased the property. She said Huna Totem will need to show the Juneau Planning Commission that its plans are consistent with the goals and criteria set forward by the Visitor Industry Task Force.

She says the next step for Huna Totem will be to apply to the Planning Commission for a conditional use permit. That will be the public’s next opportunity to provide comments.

Huna Totem and Goldbelt still need permission from the city to develop and operate in the city-owned tidelands around the property. The Coast Guard and NOAA must also be on board if the project impacts their water access.

Pierce said she’s looking forward to having a definitive answer on what development at the parcel will look like so the city’s own long-range planning can move forward.

“We’re just looking forward to having an answer yes or no on this project” she said. “We have a lot of plans and ideas that hinge on whether or not a fifth cruise ship dock is constructed.”

Norwegian did not immediately respond when KTOO asked why the company gave away land it spent millions to acquire. But in a press release a Norwegian executive said the company wanted the project to be integrated with the local community and that it became “abundantly clear” that Huna Totem should lead the effort.

Norwegian and Huna Totem have worked together before. This March the companies agreed to develop a dock in Whittier.

It also introduced pioneering new onboard experiences such as the cruise industry’s first-ever rock climbing wall ice-skating rink surfing simulators Aqua Theaters for diving shows and much more. Together these innovations ushered in a new era of cruising.

Certainly Fain is close to the top of the list of people who have had the largest impact on the modern cruise sector. Consequently when he retired at the start of January 2022 Royal Caribbean Group knew that he would leave big boots to fill particularly in an industry still recovering from an unexpected and prolonged shutdown due to the ongoing pandemic. However Jason Liberty the group’s new president and CEO is quickly proving that he is more than qualified for the role.

Liberty joined Royal Caribbean Group in 2005 and served in financial strategic and operational roles before becoming chief financial officer in 2013. He spent the past 10 years working alongside Fain before making the step up. “I think the transition and adaptation to the new position has gone very well – my predecessor Richard and our board did an outstanding job with preparing me for the role” he says. “I am also blessed to have the best team helping me deliver the best vacation experiences in the world through our leading brands and fleet.”

Now Liberty leads the company’s three global cruise brands – Royal Caribbean International Celebrity Cruises and Silversea Cruises (which the group acquired in July 2020 before selling Azamara Cruises) and TUI Cruises and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises of which it is a 50 per cent owner as part of a joint venture. In addition Liberty is responsible for spearheading the group’s strategy technology supply chain port operations and legal functions. He has had to hit the ground running in the first few months of his new role.

“The impact of the pandemic has certainly been the biggest challenge that has ever faced our company and industry” he says. “Whether having to navigate through almost two years of no revenue or ramping up the operations of our entire fleet in less than year the resiliency of our business the work ethic and innovative nature of our team and the incredible support of our partners has shone through this incredible black swan event.”

Today all 63 ships in the fleet are back on the water and most countries have reopened to cruise in a “meaningful way” prompting guests to return to Royal Caribbean ships says Liberty.

“Our fleet is fully back at sea our business has normalised and we continue to see strong demand for cruising with key secular trends such as consumers spending on experiences rather than things accelerating” he says. “Cruise offers a strong value proposition and as consumers look to get out and experience the world once again cruising is an attractive option.

“Our mission in the short and long term is simple – we look to wake up every day and deliver the best vacation experiences on Earth responsibly. Our priorities are to ensure we live up to our mission by having the best brands ships destinations and people.”

This year Royal Caribbean Group will host the official naming ceremonies for Celebrity Cruises’ latest Edge-class ship Celebrity Beyond and Royal Caribbean International’s biggest Oasis-class vessel to date Wonder of the Seas. It will also open new port facilities including a terminal in Galveston Texas. In 2023 it will welcome Silversea Cruises’ Silver Nova and Royal Caribbean International’s Icon of the Seas to the fleet – its first LNG ships.

“Our future is full of promise and innovation” says Liberty. “This combined with our amazing people and the communities we partner with around the world fuels my excitement for each day. We’re also doubling down on efforts to significantly reduce our carbon footprint and improve its impact on the communities that support our BlueGreen Promise.”

In May Royal Caribbean confirmed that its Icon-class vessels would be bigger than those in its Oasis class thereby making Icon of the Seas the largest passenger ship in the world when it arrives in 2023. Two additional Icon-class ships will join the fleet by 2030.

Features on Icon of the Seas are yet to be revealed but the brand has confirmed that it will offer the “latest innovations and signature features that Royal Caribbean’s teams have imagined and reimagined in bold new ways” as well as technologies that will enable a shift towards cleaner energy. The brand’s CEO Michael Bayley also set chins wagging when he posted a Facebook video of a large pearl-like sphere that is 46 feet tall and 50 feet in diameter being lifted onto the vessel at the Meyer Turku shipyard in Finland in May writing: “Exciting construction update on Icon of the Seas! A top-secret piece of the revolutionary ship is on the move in Turku Finland.”

Liberty notes that the Royal Caribbean Group’s portfolio offers “something for every type of guest and at every budget”. This includes everything from ultra-luxury and expedition cruising with Silversea to multigenerational “something-for-everyone” cruising on Royal Caribbean International ships and the “modern luxury” product on Celebrity Cruises.

“Over the coming years we hope to evolve the brands and other areas of our business by continuing to be a leader in innovation and technology” he says. “We want to bring the best vacations possible to all our guests.

“Royal Caribbean Group has many exciting projects on the horizon that will help us continue to deliver great vacations responsibly to our guests. We are also committed to working with our destinations around the world to offer our guests exclusive experiences including new offerings at Perfect Day at CocoCay our private island experience for our Royal Caribbean International brand.

“I look forward to bringing new ships online delivering superior returns and enhancing our portfolio to deliver on this mission every day. I’m excited about it all.”

At almost 300 sites on the Great Lakes and coast to coast unregulated buried and landfilled coal ash is putting water supplies at risk alleges a federal lawsuit filed August 25.

This threat is in addition to contamination from up to 700 coal ash repositories that are covered by 2015 federal coal ash rules. The Environmental Protection Agency this year began enforcing these rules after years of inaction but environmental groups in Illinois Indiana California Tennessee and Washington D.C. that filed the new lawsuit are demanding the agency close the loophole that exempts inactive landfills and buried coal ash from the rules.

They note that data reported by companies themselves shows that three-quarters of active coal ash landfills covered by the regulations are polluting groundwater with toxic compounds like arsenic and lithium. The lawsuit notes that inactive landfills are much less likely to be lined hence the risk of contamination is likely even higher.

The lawsuit is based in part on analysis of a trove of documents that companies filed with the EPA’s Office of Water in 2010. Earthjustice the law firm representing the plaintiffs says that along with pits constructed specifically to store ash; ash scattered or mixed with soil should legally qualify as a landfill and should be regulated.

They say such ash produced from burning coal for power in decades past poses a serious risk to groundwater and water bodies at places like Waukegan on the shores of Lake Michigan in northern Illinois and Michigan City Indiana on the lake’s southern shore.

“Before there were any regulations whatsoever for this stuff they just kind of dumped it anywhere” said Jenny Cassel an attorney at Earthjustice one of the organizations that filed the notice of intent to sue. “Near the coal plants particularly next to the rivers they would just find depressions in the ground or dig them and throw coal ash in.”

The lawsuit filed in federal district court in Washington D.C. demands that the EPA review the federal rules on coal ash and add regulation of inactive landfills. Currently coal ash ponds at coal plants that closed before 2015 are also exempt from the federal rules but a 2018 federal appeals court decision means the EPA is mandated to draft regulations for such “legacy ash” ponds.

The EPA anticipates releasing proposed rules for these legacy ponds later this year according to an EPA spokesperson and the agency has received public comment on the rule-making. Earthjustice attorney Lisa Evans said advocates want the EPA to move more quickly on regulating legacy coal ash ponds and they hope the lawsuit will force the agency to add inactive landfills to regulations as well.

“Coal ash stored on the shores of the Great Lakes poses unreasonable risks to the drinking water of millions and to the health of our irreplaceable water resources” said Evans. “For decades these companies knew that hazardous chemicals were leaking out of their unlined dumps but they did nothing to stop it and everything to hide the damage.”

A beach foregone

Children and dogs ran across the sprawling municipal beach in Waukegan Illinois on an overcast Saturday morning in April. A kite sailed through the sky wind generated breaking waves and just north of the beach visitors could catch a clear glimpse of the three looming towers of the coal-powered Waukegan Generating Station.

Community members regularly head to the beach in the summer to cool off and spend time with their families somewhere that’s free Waukegan resident Dulce Ortiz said. Yet she rarely visits the beach and won’t allow her children to go in the lake because she’s worried about pollution from the area’s heavy industry including the tons of coal ash stored near the power plant owned by Midwest Generation LLC — a subsidiary of NRG Energy.

“It’s sad because [the lake] is something that we can see but we can’t touch” said Ortiz co-chair of Waukegan-based environmental justice organization Clean Power Lake County. “I just don’t want to risk it. I don’t want my kids playing in that water.”

Waukegan is one of over 700 sites nationwide where toxic coal ash from coal-fired power plants poses a serious contamination risk to groundwater lakes and rivers. Coal ash contains heavy metals such as arsenic and lead that can leach or spill into water. A federal rule adopted in 2015 mandates that companies monitor groundwater around coal ash ponds and develop plans for their safe closure.

But the 2015 rule doesn’t cover coal ash ponds closed before that year or ash that was scattered throughout coal plant sites often mixed with dirt or sand and used to build up lakeside land — as at Waukegan. Advocates fear such “legacy” or historic ash causes a particular risk to the Great Lakes and other water sources but currently there are no federal regulations governing it.

Coal ash 101: Everything you need to know about this toxic waste As coal plants close nationwide they leave behind nearly a billion tons of toxic coal ash. The Medill School of Journalism spent months investigating the coal ash threat and how regulators companies and environmental groups are handling it. Here are the basics that will help you understand this looming threat. What is coal ash? Coal ash is the toxic byproduct of burning coal to generate electricity. It contains heavy metals that can contaminate groundwater lakes and rivers. Where is coal ash located? Coal ash is stored in more than 700 ponds and landfills nationwide most of them unlined. Ash can also be recycled — known as “beneficial reuse” — in which it is used to make concrete or build roads. What is the Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) Rule? In 2015 the EPA established rules for coal ash units requiring companies to test groundwater remediate contamination and make plans to close the units. Companies have to post groundwater monitoring data and closure plans online. The rule excludes hundreds of “legacy ash ponds” that closed before the federal rule took effect in 2015 yet these ponds are still causing serious groundwater contamination. The rule also does not cover coal ash that was over decades dumped and scattered around coal plant sites and even surrounding areas often used to build up berms or fill in land. Is coal ash contaminating our water? Data posted by companies shows that contaminants around coal ash ponds frequently exceed limits set by the EPA sometimes exponentially. Private wells used for drinking water can be and have been contaminated by coal ash. Rivers and lakes used for recreation and municipal water supplies can also be contaminated by coal ash. What’s in coal ash? Boron Boron is linked to reproductive problems like low birth weight and is also toxic to aquatic life. Lead Lead is a potent neurotoxin linked to swelling of the brain and nervous system damage. Lithium Lithium is linked to liver and kidney damage as well as neurological diseases and birth defects. Arsenic Arsenic is linked to nervous system damage and higher rates of cancer. Molybdenum Molybdenum is linked to gout high blood pressure and liver diseases. Cobalt Cobalt is linked to thyroid damage and blood diseases. How is a coal ash pond closed? Coal ash sites need to close after getting their final shipment of coal ash if they are polluting groundwater above certain standards or if they fail to meet other safety criteria. The rules say all unlined ponds needed to stop accepting waste by April 2021 though some requested exceptions and have continued filling with coal ash. Cap-in-place closure A protective cover is placed over the coal ash so rainwater doesn’t get in and cause flooding or increased leaching into groundwater. If the coal ash is left in contact with groundwater or permeable rock it can continue leaching contaminants even when capped. Removal closure Coal ash is excavated from a pond dried and moved to a lined landfill above the water table. Companies may be able to build a landfill on the power plant site. Shipping coal ash to landfills off-site means heavy truck traffic or shipping by barge or rail. Who pays for coal ash cleanup? Companies The owners of coal ash sites — utilities or power companies and their shareholders — can pay the cost of coal ash cleanup often hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars across multiple sites. Ratepayers Utilities can seek approval from state public service commissions to bill the cost of coal ash cleanup to ratepayers. They can even seek a profit as a portion of the costs. Government If coal ash is designated a Superfund site the EPA can make the responsible parties — utility or power companies — pay for the cleanup. The government can also pay for the cleanup from a pool of Superfund money especially if the companies no longer exist or can’t pay. Compiled by Sruthi Gopalakrishnan.

In 2018 a federal appeals court ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to add legacy ash impoundments to the rules; it is not clear how much progress the agency has made or how it will define ash that is covered. In May national and local environmental groups including the Waukegan-area organization Clean Power Lake County filed a notice of intent to sue the EPA. They say the agency has failed to manage the risk posed by legacy coal ash at sites — including Waukegan — owned by Midwest Generation and by the Tennessee Valley Authority.

The notice estimates approximately 140 legacy ash ponds have escaped regulation because of the exemption.

The EPA anticipates releasing proposed rules for legacy surface impoundments later this year according to an EPA spokesperson and the agency has received public comment on the rule-making.

In addition to those legacy coal ash ponds experts figure that many coal plant sites have tons of coal ash scattered and piled in the ground deposited in decades past with little documentation or oversight. It’s unlikely the rule updates the EPA is currently working on will cover such scattered historic coal ash.

Erosion and contamination

The Waukegan coal plant is scheduled to close this summer the latest of many coal plants in Illinois and nationwide that have become uneconomical. Residents and activists have cheered the closure but they fear the coal ash will make it hard to revitalize the lakefront.

The plant’s current units have been operating since 1958 and 1962 and two ponds onsite hold coal ash deposited over the decades. It appears coal ash was also scattered across a nearby area according to an expert report and NRG’s own filings and that ash is not covered by the federal rules.

A strip of land just over 1000 feet wide separates the Waukegan station’s active coal ash ponds from Lake Michigan. According to an NRG report the groundwater is flowing southeast toward the lake which provides drinking water to Waukegan residents and over 10 million people in total. Advocates fear coal ash pollution could be flowing into the lake.

Groundwater monitoring required by the federal rules has shown contamination around the Waukegan coal plant — almost 400 times since 2010 according to the notice of intent to sue.

“Groundwater contamination has been happening at these sites for over a decade the agency has been involved but no regulatory body has put an end to it” said Christine Nannicelli who leads the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign in Illinois.

Coal ash scattered throughout a coal plant site can actually relieve companies of dealing with pollution from even the coal ash ponds that are covered by federal rules environmental experts say since companies often argue that groundwater contamination is due to the historic ash and hence not their responsibility.

NRG made this argument about contamination found at the Waukegan site noting in documents filed under the federal rules that there likely was coal ash mixed into the elevated berms around the ponds and ash was found in the ground when groundwater monitoring wells were dug.

The Illinois Pollution Control Board determined in 2019 that the historic scattered ash was indeed “more likely than not” a cause or contributor to the site’s groundwater contamination. In some places the ash used as fill was found as deep as 22 feet below the surface.

While experts think the historic ash at Waukegan is contaminating groundwater some also worry that erosion could eventually put land laced with coal ash at risk of collapsing directly into the lake. The ash is a “ticking bomb” Ortiz said.

“It’s too close for comfort. I’ve seen the erosion happen in the last 10 years which has been pretty dramatic.”

North of Waukegan the lake’s shoreline erodes as much as nearly 10 feet a year according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Increasingly extreme lake levels and storms exacerbated by climate change could also lead to a spill according to a report from the Environmental Law and Policy Center which identified Waukegan as a hotspot for flooding and erosion risk.

Coal ash is just one of numerous environmental justice issues facing Waukegan about 40 miles north of Chicago. Within a 2-mile stretch of the Waukegan shoreline there are four federally recognized Superfund toxic waste sites with ongoing cleanup efforts by the EPA.

Just across a two-lane road from the coal plant chain-link fences block off a field contaminated with asbestos. A fifth Superfund site is located in the middle of the city directly next to a nursing home multiple apartment complexes a church and small businesses. Community leaders want NRG to clean up all the coal ash not just the ponds covered by the federal rules so that it doesn’t become another environmental liability for years into the future.

“We just don’t want to be left with another Superfund site” said Eduardo Flores a Waukegan resident and co-chair of Clean Power Lake County.

More than 70% of Waukegan residents are Latino or Black and almost 30% are immigrants according to U.S. Census data. More than 15% of households live below the poverty line.

“You don’t have coal plants in affluent communities” Ortiz said. “Why is that?”

“People here in Waukegan know what it’s like to be left with messes to clean up” Flores added. “We’re just tired of corporations not cleaning up their messes.”

Indiana: Legacy ash in a coal state

One hundred miles down Lake Michigan’s coast from Waukegan sits the Michigan City Generating Station in Northwest Indiana. Its cooling tower — resembling a nuclear plant rather than a typical coal plant — releases billowing plumes of steam over homes and local churches.

Like Waukegan Michigan City is a working-class industrial community where a coal plant has long caused pollution and coal ash poses a threat that could last long after the coal plant closes. Thirty percent of residents are Black and poverty rates are 12% higher than the national average according to U.S. Census data.

The station’s coal ash ponds are covered by the federal rule and the ash is currently being removed.

But in years after the plant opened in 1931 a mixture of coal ash sand and soil was used to fill in the space behind steel walls buffering the site from Lake Michigan. In all about two million cubic yards of coal ash sit below the coal plant in a mixture of sand and soil up to 40 feet deep in places according to an export report and company documents. In documents NIPSCO calls this “made land.” To activists and environmental organizations it’s a disaster waiting to happen.

Indra Frank the environmental health and water policy director at Hoosier Environmental Council said the steel seawalls holding the ash-laden land back from the lake have a finite lifespan. The seawalls which sit in a flood plain are at least 70 years old.

“Service life span for steel brake-wall piling can be 50 years or more” NIPSCO wrote in response to public comments on its proposal for closing ash ponds.

A study by Kirk Engineering and Natural Resources commissioned by Earthjustice confirms the steel is “aging” and that the coal ash fill is “at risk of catastrophic release” if the seawall continues to deteriorate or a flood occurs.

“It’s only a matter of time before that sea wall will fail and we’ll have a spill” Frank said. “And once there’s a spill it’s basically impossible to recover.”

NIPSCO spokesperson Nick Meyer said the company is keeping tabs on the situation.

“Those walls are regularly monitored and inspected both by NIPSCO and third-party professional engineers” he said by email. “If recommendations are made based on inspection from either our internal professionals or our third-party partners NIPSCO would schedule mitigation measures.”

In addition to the aging seawall residents are concerned with groundwater contamination caused by coal ash. Data shows contaminants like arsenic are migrating toward Trail Creek stream and Lake Michigan. Contaminated water and sediment can work their way up the food chain and accumulate to dangerous levels in fish. Ashley Williams executive director at Just Transition Northwest Indiana said the contamination presents a risk to the many people who fish near the plant and along Trail Creek.

Williams is intimately familiar with living in a town with untouchable water. She grew up in Ottawa Illinois.

Nicknamed Radium City Ottawa was home to two radium dial painting companies which employed women to paint watch dials using radioactive paint. Designated as a Superfund site the city uses reverse osmosis to remove radium from its groundwater.

Now a resident in Michigan City Williams said she is determined to protect the water of Lake Michigan and its tributaries.

“We have a sacred duty to protect it at all costs — certainly for us as well as for future generations” she said.

In an effort to raise awareness of the coal ash issue Williams and others from Just Transition NWI are speaking at community events. In April Williams spoke to congregants at New Hope Missionary Baptist Church during a Sunday sermon.

The church’s pastor Jacarra Williams called the experience “very eye-opening.”

“It’s my job to make sure that our people are aware” Pastor Williams said.

In April NIPSCO began excavating and removing the plant’s five coal ash ponds that are covered by the federal rule. NIPSCO does not intend to remove the scattered legacy ash from the site.

The plant is set to retire between 2026 and 2028. NIPSCO has yet to announce plans for the space following the plant’s retirement but Ashley Williams and Pastor Williams hope residents have a say. They envision a community space filled with nature for the local youth — “a beacon of hope.” But if the removal does not include legacy ash residents wonder whether it will be safe to use the space.

“If they’re not going to fully clean it up what kind of future can we really imagine for our communities for our families?” Williams said.

A cautionary tale

To highlight the dangers of historic coal ash advocates point to the Indiana beachfront community Town of Pines where coal ash from the Michigan City plant five miles away has wreaked havoc on residents’ lives and property.

Cathi Murray moved to the Town of Pines from the Rogers Park neighborhood of Chicago in 1990 with her husband to start a family. They loved the proximity to Lake Michigan and the Indiana Dunes later named a national park.

They didn’t know that NIPSCO had been dumping coal ash for decades into a nearby landfill or that coal ash was used as fill in residential yards and roads right in town. Toxins including high levels of boron and molybdenum leached into the aquifer a frightening development since the residents relied entirely on private wells tapping groundwater.

In 2004 the EPA declared the Town of Pines a Superfund site because of groundwater and soil contamination.

“We thought we found our dream place to live and it turned out to be our worst nightmare” Murray said.

After the contamination was discovered residents began drinking bottled water but had to continue using well water to wash their dishes and shower. Years later NIPSCO connected homes to Michigan City municipal water.

“It was pretty stressful because you’re worried” Murray said. “I have two daughters — one had a rare bowel disorder and one is hearing impaired. Did me drinking water when I was pregnant with them when I was nursing them did that cause any of this?”

Murray who served on the town council for 16 years said she has observed disproportionate levels of thyroid and respiratory issues among residents; Murray herself has had a thyroid tumor removed.

In March NIPSCO began an $11.8 million cleanup in accordance with a federal consent decree. The decree calls for the utility to dig up and replace contaminated soil near homes and businesses. NIPSCO must also monitor nearby groundwater and wells to ensure contamination does not spread.

But Murray said NIPSCO is replacing only three feet of topsoil which she believes is not enough. To this day according to Murray 38 homes in a town of fewer than 600 residents are still on private wells. And in a town with a median property value of $100400 and a median income of $47000 Murray said residents don’t have the means to move away — especially since the Superfund designation would make their homes hard to sell.

Meyer said by email that groundwater monitoring has shown no additional homes need to be connected to municipal water and the company will continue monitoring.

“They’re not cleaning it up” Murray said of the utility. “They’re covering it up.”

Fighting and hoping for change

On the Middle Fork of the Vermilion River Illinois’ only National Scenic River the banks are stained orange. Three unlined eroding impoundments hold coal ash equivalent in volume to two and a half Empire State buildings. This legacy coal ash is not covered by the federal rules since the coal plant closed in 2011.

Last year the Illinois attorney general filed suit against Dynegy Midwest Generation now owned by Vistra Corp. alleging seeps from the ash were contaminating the river. As a result Vistra proposed to remove its 3.3 million cubic yards of legacy ash from the riverbank the largest ever coal ash removal project in the state.

The state government took action after years of activism and lawsuits from local residents and organizations a sign that public pressure can eventually pay off.

“This is a solution that we’ve been advocating for a really really long time and we got it” said Andrew Rehn water resources engineer at the Prairie Rivers Network. “So in many ways this is just a huge win.”

The Vermilion example and advocacy by the Prairie Rivers Network and other downstate Illinois groups were crucial to the state legislature ultimately including legacy ash impoundments in the state’s coal ash law passed last year. But the law doesn’t cover historic ash scattered around sites.

The Illinois Pollution Control Board has opened a sub-docket wherein comments were submitted this summer about adding historic scattered ash to the state rules.

“Frankly how protective [is] this agency going to be?” Nannicelli asked. “How much do they listen to community voices?”

Locals in Waukegan have grand plans for what their lakefront could become if the historic coal ash is removed and the site fully cleaned up.

“One of the things you will hear when you talk to people about Waukegan is the word ‘potential’” said David Villalobos a former alderman in Waukegan who made the coal plant central to his campaign and work.

Once the plant closes and the site is cleaned Villalobos envisions a community space with a restaurant and brewery where patrons can grab a locally crafted beer. He sees bike and dog trails snaking through the open land and possibly a baseball diamond.

Flores similarly wants to “reclaim that land and have it for the community.”

He imagines creating a wildlife reserve for birds.

“I do have hope that someday in the future hopefully sooner rather than later we are able to live in a coal ash-free community” Flores said.

Earthjustice the law firm representing the plaintiffs says that along with pits constructed specifically to store ash; ash scattered or mixed with soil should legally qualify as a landfill and should be regulated.

They say such ash produced from burning coal for power in decades past poses a serious risk to groundwater and water bodies at places like Waukegan on the shores of Lake Michigan in northern Illinois and Michigan City Indiana on the lake’s southern shore.

“Before there were any regulations whatsoever for this stuff they just kind of dumped it anywhere” said Jenny Cassel an attorney at Earthjustice one of the organizations that filed the notice of intent to sue. “Near the coal plants particularly next to the rivers they would just find depressions in the ground or dig them and throw coal ash in.”

The lawsuit filed in federal district court in Washington D.C. demands that the EPA review the federal rules on coal ash and add regulation of inactive landfills. Currently coal ash ponds at coal plants that closed before 2015 are also exempt from the federal rules but a 2018 federal appeals court decision means the EPA is mandated to draft regulations for such “legacy ash” ponds.

The EPA anticipates releasing proposed rules for these legacy ponds later this year according to an EPA spokesperson and the agency has received public comment on the rule-making. Earthjustice attorney Lisa Evans said advocates want the EPA to move more quickly on regulating legacy coal ash ponds and they hope the lawsuit will force the agency to add inactive landfills to regulations as well.

“Coal ash stored on the shores of the Great Lakes poses unreasonable risks to the drinking water of millions and to the health of our irreplaceable water resources” said Evans. “For decades these companies knew that hazardous chemicals were leaking out of their unlined dumps but they did nothing to stop it and everything to hide the damage.”

A beach foregone

On an overcast Saturday in April children and dogs ran across Waukegan’s sprawling municipal beach. A kite sailed through the sky wind generated breaking waves and just north of the beach visitors could catch a clear glimpse of the three looming towers of the coal-powered Waukegan Generating Station.

The plant stopped burning coal this summer reducing local air pollution but the unregulated coal ash remains a burden and risk as locals see it.

Waukegan resident Dulce Ortiz said she rarely visits the beach and won’t allow her children to go in the lake because she’s worried about pollution from the area’s heavy industry including the tons of coal ash stored near the power plant owned by Midwest Generation LLC — a subsidiary of NRG Energy.

“It’s sad because [the lake] is something that we can see but we can’t touch” said Ortiz co-chair of Waukegan-based environmental justice organization Clean Power Lake County. “I just don’t want to risk it. I don’t want my kids playing in that water.”

The Waukegan plant’s recently-retired coal units had been operating since 1958 and 1962 and two ponds onsite hold coal ash deposited over the decades. It appears coal ash was also scattered across a nearby area according to an expert report and NRG’s own filings. That ash is not covered by the federal rules a situation groups hope to change through the lawsuit.

A strip of land just over 1000 feet wide separates the Waukegan station’s active regulated coal ash ponds from Lake Michigan. According to an NRG report the groundwater is flowing southeast toward the lake which provides drinking water to Waukegan residents and over 10 million people in total. Advocates fear coal ash pollution could be flowing into the lake.

Groundwater monitoring required by the federal rules has shown contamination around the Waukegan coal plant — almost 400 times since 2010 according to the notice of intent to sue.

“Groundwater contamination has been happening at these sites for over a decade the agency has been involved but no regulatory body has put an end to it” said Christine Nannicelli who leads the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign in Illinois.

Off the hook into the lake?

Coal ash scattered throughout a coal plant site can actually relieve companies of dealing with pollution from even the coal ash ponds that are covered by federal rules environmental experts say and the recent lawsuit alleges since companies often argue that groundwater contamination is due to the historic ash and hence not their responsibility.

This move allowed the TVA to avoid responsibility for coal ash contamination at its Bull Run plant in Tennessee the lawsuit argues.

NRG also made this argument about contamination found at the Waukegan site noting in documents filed under the federal rules that there likely was coal ash mixed into the elevated berms around the ponds and ash was found in the ground when groundwater monitoring wells were dug. Hence NRG argued contamination could not be attributed to coal ash covered by the federal rules.

The Illinois Pollution Control Board determined in 2019 that historic ash was indeed “more likely than not” a cause or contributor to the site’s groundwater contamination. In some places the ash used as fill was found as deep as 22 feet below the surface.

While experts think the historic ash at Waukegan is contaminating groundwater some also worry that erosion could eventually put land laced with coal ash at risk of collapsing directly into the lake. The ash is a “ticking bomb” Ortiz said.

“It’s too close for comfort. I’ve seen the erosion happen in the last 10 years which has been pretty dramatic.”

North of Waukegan the lake’s shoreline erodes as much as nearly 10 feet a year according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Increasingly extreme lake levels and storms exacerbated by climate change could also lead to a spill according to a report from the Environmental Law and Policy Center which identified Waukegan as a hotspot for flooding and erosion risk.

An environmental justice issue

Coal ash is just one of numerous environmental justice issues facing Waukegan about 40 miles north of Chicago. Within a 2-mile stretch of the Waukegan shoreline there are four federally recognized Superfund toxic waste sites with ongoing cleanup efforts by the EPA.

Just across a two-lane road from the coal plant chain-link fences block off a field contaminated with asbestos. A fifth Superfund site is located in the middle of the city directly next to a nursing home multiple apartment complexes a church and small businesses. Community leaders want NRG to clean up all the coal ash not just the ponds covered by the federal rules so that it doesn’t become another environmental liability for years into the future.

“We just don’t want to be left with another Superfund site” said Eduardo Flores a Waukegan resident and co-chair of Clean Power Lake County.

More than 70% of Waukegan residents are Latino or Black and almost 30% are immigrants according to U.S. Census data. More than 15% of households live below the poverty line.

“You don’t have coal plants in affluent communities” Ortiz said. “Why is that?”

“People here in Waukegan know what it’s like to be left with messes to clean up” Flores added. “We’re just tired of corporations not cleaning up their messes.”

Indiana ash

One hundred miles down Lake Michigan’s coast from Waukegan sits NIPSCO’s Michigan City Generating Station in Northwest Indiana. Its cooling tower — resembling a nuclear plant rather than a typical coal plant — releases billowing plumes of steam over homes and local churches.

Like Waukegan Michigan City is a working-class industrial community where a coal plant has long caused pollution and coal ash poses a threat that could last long after the coal plant closes. Thirty percent of residents are Black and poverty rates are 12% higher than the national average according to U.S. Census data.

The station’s coal ash ponds are covered by the federal rule and the ash is currently being removed. But it is also home to unregulated historic coal ash hence local groups are plaintiffs in the recent lawsuit.

In the years after the plant opened in 1931 a mixture of coal ash sand and soil was used to fill in the space behind steel walls buffering the plant site from Lake Michigan. In all about two million cubic yards of coal ash sit below the coal plant in a mixture of sand and soil up to 40 feet deep in places according to an export report and company documents. In documents NIPSCO calls this “made land.” To activists and environmental organizations it’s a disaster waiting to happen.

Indra Frank the environmental health and water policy director at Hoosier Environmental Council said the steel seawalls holding the ash-laden land back from the lake have a finite lifespan. The seawalls which sit in a flood plain are at least 70 years old.

“Service life span for steel brake-wall piling can be 50 years or more” NIPSCO wrote in response to public comments on its proposal for closing ash ponds.

A study by Kirk Engineering and Natural Resources commissioned by Earthjustice confirms the steel is “aging” and that the coal ash fill is “at risk of catastrophic release” if the seawall continues to deteriorate or a flood occurs.

“It’s only a matter of time before that sea wall will fail and we’ll have a spill” Frank said. “And once there’s a spill it’s basically impossible to recover.”

NIPSCO spokesperson Nick Meyer said the company is keeping tabs on the situation.

“Those walls are regularly monitored and inspected both by NIPSCO and third-party professional engineers” he said by email. “If recommendations are made based on inspection from either our internal professionals or our third-party partners NIPSCO would schedule mitigation measures.”

Groundwater worries

In addition to the aging seawall residents are concerned with groundwater contamination caused by coal ash. Data shows contaminants like arsenic are migrating toward Trail Creek stream and Lake Michigan. Contaminated water and sediment can work their way up the food chain and accumulate to dangerous levels in fish. Ashley Williams executive director at Just Transition Northwest Indiana said the contamination presents a risk to the many people who fish near the plant and along Trail Creek.

Williams is intimately familiar with living in a town with untouchable water. She grew up in Ottawa Illinois.

Nicknamed Radium City Ottawa was home to two radium dial painting companies which employed women to paint watch dials using radioactive paint. Designated as a Superfund site the city uses reverse osmosis to remove radium from its groundwater.

Now a resident in Michigan City Williams said she is determined to protect the water of Lake Michigan and its tributaries.

“We have a sacred duty to protect it at all costs — certainly for us as well as for future generations” she said.

In an effort to raise awareness of the coal ash issue Williams and others from Just Transition NWI are speaking at community events. In April Williams spoke to congregants at New Hope Missionary Baptist Church during a Sunday sermon.

The church’s pastor Jacarra Williams called the experience “very eye-opening.”

“It’s my job to make sure that our people are aware” Pastor Williams said.

In April NIPSCO began excavating and removing the plant’s five coal ash ponds that are covered by the federal rules. NIPSCO does not intend to remove the unregulated ash fill from the site.

The plant is set to retire between 2026 and 2028. NIPSCO has yet to announce plans for the space following the plant’s retirement but Ashley Williams and Pastor Williams hope residents have a say. They envision a community space filled with nature for the local youth — “a beacon of hope.” But if the removal does not include ash currently exempt from the regulations residents wonder whether it will be safe to use the space.

“If they’re not going to fully clean it up what kind of future can we really imagine for our communities for our families?” Williams said.

A cautionary tale

To highlight the dangers of historic coal ash advocates point to the Indiana beachfront community Town of Pines where coal ash from the Michigan City plant five miles away has wreaked havoc on residents’ lives and property.

Cathi Murray moved to the Town of Pines from the Rogers Park neighborhood of Chicago in 1990 with her husband to start a family. They loved the proximity to Lake Michigan and the Indiana Dunes later named a national park.

They didn’t know that NIPSCO had been dumping coal ash for decades into a nearby landfill or that coal ash was used as fill in residential yards and roads right in town. Toxins including high levels of boron and molybdenum leached into the aquifer a frightening development since the residents relied entirely on private wells tapping groundwater.

In 2004 the EPA declared the Town of Pines a Superfund site because of groundwater and soil contamination.

“We thought we found our dream place to live and it turned out to be our worst nightmare” Murray said.

After the contamination was discovered residents began drinking bottled water but had to continue using well water to wash their dishes and shower. Years later NIPSCO connected homes to Michigan City municipal water.

“It was pretty stressful because you’re worried” Murray said. “I have two daughters — one had a rare bowel disorder and one is hearing impaired. Did me drinking water when I was pregnant with them when I was nursing them did that cause any of this?”

Murray who served on the town council for 16 years said she has observed disproportionate levels of thyroid and respiratory issues among residents; Murray herself has had a thyroid tumor removed.

In March NIPSCO began an $11.8 million cleanup in accordance with a federal consent decree. The decree calls for the utility to dig up and replace contaminated soil near homes and businesses. NIPSCO must also monitor nearby groundwater and wells to ensure contamination does not spread.

But Murray said NIPSCO is replacing only three feet of topsoil which she believes is not enough. To this day according to Murray 38 homes in a town of fewer than 600 residents are still on private wells. And in a town with a median property value of $100400 and a median income of $47000 Murray said residents don’t have the means to move away — especially since the Superfund designation would make their homes hard to sell.

Meyer said by email that groundwater monitoring has shown no additional homes need to be connected to municipal water and the company will continue monitoring.

“They’re not cleaning it up” Murray said of the utility. “They’re covering it up.”

Fighting and hoping for change

On the Middle Fork of the Vermilion River Illinois’ only National Scenic River the banks are stained orange. Three unlined eroding impoundments hold coal ash equivalent in volume to two and a half Empire State buildings. This coal ash is not covered by the federal rules since the coal plant closed in 2011. It is among the landfill sites that should be regulated according to the recent lawsuit. Meanwhile years of legal action by local groups has forced cleanup.

Last year the Illinois attorney general filed suit against Dynegy Midwest Generation now owned by Vistra Corp. alleging seeps from the ash were contaminating the river. As a result Vistra proposed to remove its 3.3 million cubic yards of ash from the riverbank the largest ever coal ash removal project in the state.

“This is a solution that we’ve been advocating for a really really long time and we got it” said Andrew Rehn water resources engineer at the Prairie Rivers Network. “So in many ways this is just a huge win.”

The Vermilion example and advocacy by the Prairie Rivers Network and other downstate Illinois groups were crucial to the state legislature ultimately including legacy ash ponds in the state’s coal ash law passed last year. But the law doesn’t cover historic ash dumped or scattered around sites. Advocates hope the lawsuit will force regulation of such ash.

The Illinois Pollution Control Board has opened a sub-docket wherein comments were submitted this summer about adding historic scattered ash to the state rules.

“Frankly how protective [is] this agency going to be?” Nannicelli asked. “How much do they listen to community voices?”

Locals in Waukegan have grand plans for what their lakefront could become if the historic coal ash is removed and the site fully cleaned up.

“One of the things you will hear when you talk to people about Waukegan is the word ‘potential’” said David Villalobos a former alderman in Waukegan who made the coal plant central to his campaign and work.

Once the plant closes and the site is cleaned Villalobos envisions a community space with a restaurant and brewery where patrons can grab a locally crafted beer. He sees bike and dog trails snaking through the open land and possibly a baseball diamond.

Flores similarly wants to “reclaim that land and have it for the community.”

He imagines creating a wildlife reserve for birds.

“I do have hope that someday in the future hopefully sooner rather than later we are able to live in a coal ash-free community” Flores said.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang confirmed what we’ve suspected for months: Nvidia actually built too many gaming GPUs and is now being forced to sell them for less money. “We found ourselves with excess inventory” says Huang. “Our strategy is to sell-in well below the current sell-through levels in the marketplace to give the channel an opportunity to correct.”

“We’ve implemented programs with our partners to price-position the product in the channel in preparation for our next generation” he also said on the call.

Here’s what that sounds like to me: In order to sell as many RTX 3000 graphics cards and chips as it can before the RTX 4000 series begins to arrive this fall it’s cutting prices — to distributors anyhow.

Related The GPU shortage is over

That doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll see a too-good-to-be-true price on a graphics card or gaming laptop right away because the final price is up to partners and retailers — but those parties have their own incentives to clear shelves even if they disguise them as sales rather than across-the-board price cuts. Either way the trend we’re seeing is absolutely down with some cards once again appearing at MSRP after years of commanding 2-3x their price on eBay.

Nvidia is also trying to signal that the current-gen Ampere GPUs will live alongside next-gen ones — Huang says current-gen GPUs will “be layered on top” of the “exciting next generation” of chips. He also hinted that there might be a place for extra GPUs in cloud data centers: “we hear quite broadly that GPU supply is in shortage in the cloud.” So Nvidia may have other options than simply clearing inventory of its GPUs by pricing them low.

Second CFO Collette Kress intriguingly suggested that Nvidia may have something entirely different up its sleeves to improve its gaming revenue. Nvidia has “a new segment of the market that we plan to reach with our gaming technology” she said on the call.

Your guess is as good as mine. My mind immediately goes to how AMD seems to uniquely be powering a new generation of high-performance handheld gaming PCs years after Nvidia mostly gave up on that idea (though it did become the Nintendo Switch). But that might be because the last post I wrote for The Verge was about one of those handheld consoles. It could just as easily be a gaming-focused take on the metaverse for all I know.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXRpc3RhLmNvbS9jaGFydC8yNTU3OC9udmlkaWFzLXF1YXJ0ZXJseS1yZXZlbnVlLWJ5LXNlZ21lbnRzL9IBT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXRpc3RhLmNvbS9jaGFydC9hbXAvMjU1NzgvbnZpZGlhcy1xdWFydGVybHktcmV2ZW51ZS1ieS1zZWdtZW50cy8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Data Center Solutions Prop up NVIDIA Revenue Nosedive,"HTML code to embed chart

I guess because I always like to think of my PC as a complete unit. I mean my PC is a total unit as it's jammed right into my chonky desk and therefore built like a tank on legs but to me it's a single device with a bunch of discrete parts inside it to make up the whole.

To Nvidia however ""GeForce is essentially a game console inside your PC."" At least that's how CEO Jen-Hsun Huang sees it.

That's fine on the one hand where it sees its own product as the most important piece of the gaming PC puzzle and the component which has the most bearing on just how slick a gaming experience you're going to get. But where I feel uncomfortable is when Huang is talking about the fact that Nvidia's targets are for the average price of a GeForce graphics card to be the same as a current gen games console.

""We’ve always believed that the ASP of GeForce should drift towards the average selling price of a game console"" says Huang in the recent Q2 2023 earnings call. ""And so it should be something along the lines of $500 or so roughly at this time.""

If people are willing to spend that much on an Xbox then surely they'll pay that for a single graphics card to stick into their PC? I guess that's the theory and honestly he's probably right—if the past couple of years have taught us anything it's that people are prepared to pay a ridiculous amount of money for a GPU if they really want it.

But if we're looking at the mainstream biggest selling graphics cards I don't want them to be priced at a level where they can't compete with Microsoft or Sony's game boxes. But pricing is going that way though fingers crossed when Nvidia unveils the RTX 40-series GPUs there will eventually be some worthwhile ~$300 cards that offer more than the previous generation.

To be completely fair to Jen-Hsun the above quote is in reference to a question on whether the average selling price (ASP) across the Nvidia GeForce GPU stack would remain the same as it has over the last couple of years or whether it would go down ""because of the absence of that crypto tightening dynamic?""

""I would say that without crypto dynamic"" responds Huang ""the mix would go down. However the overall trend long term the ASP is drifting up.""

That's when he goes on to say Nvidia's always felt it should stick its ASP at the same level as a whole games console. With console prices rising on the whole and Sony just now announcing a spike in the cost of its PlayStation 5 Jen-Hsun's only going to be focusing on an ever rising target price."

Dream Finders Homes (DFH -0.98%) is a homebuilder that is based in Jacksonville and also has a presence in several of the hottest markets in the U.S. including Orlando Texas and the Carolinas. It closed on 4874 homes in 2021 and anticipates more than 7000 in 2022.

With the real estate market cooling off interest rates rising and the persistent supply chain and labor issues homebuilders have been hit hard. Dream Finders is no exception with its stock price about 50% below its 52-week high. But if the company can execute on its unusual business model it could be a big win for long-term investors.

There's a lot to like about Dream Finders Homes

One of the biggest differentiating factors is that Dream Finders uses a ""land-light"" homebuilding model. While most other homebuilders buy large tracts of land Dream Finders buys purchase options on lots but doesn't actually buy them until it has a home under contract and ready to build. This frees up more of Dream Finders' capital to invest in growth and pursue other opportunities.

There are a few big reasons to like Dream Finders. First it specializes in markets that have above-average job growth positive net migration and relatively affordable housing costs. The company has a backlog of nearly 7200 homes as of the end of the second quarter so demand is strong.

Also the U.S. has a major housing shortage. Over the past 50 years the annual average number of housing starts has declined while the number of households has doubled. Housing inventories are near their lowest level in 20 years. And the largest group of millennials (the 27-30 age group) will be reaching their peak homebuying age in the next several years.

Note that the 100x in the headline isn't necessarily an exaggeration. Dream Finders Homes CEO Patrick Zalupski modeled the business after fellow land-light homebuilder NVR (NVR -0.46%) which has used the asset-light model along with smart capital allocation to deliver some incredible returns. In fact since it went public in 1993 NVR has generated a staggering 41700% return for shareholders -- that's 417x performance in less than three decades even after the recent downturn.

What could go wrong?

Like any stock capable of big returns Dream Finders isn't without risk. For example its geographic concentration makes the company dependent on the health of just a handful of real estate markets. And its outsized exposure to entry-level homes could be a long-term positive but this part of the market is highly sensitive to recessions pricing pressure and other headwinds.

Debt is also a major concern. With $875 million in current debt Dream Finders has a much higher debt-to-equity ratio than most other homebuilders as you can see in the chart below.

Homebuilder Debt-to-Equity Ratio Dream Finders Homes 0.88 LGI Homes 0.57 NVR 0.07 Lennar 0.25 D.R. Horton 0.26

Higher reliance on debt makes Dream Finders more susceptible to downturns and also means that its cost of capital will increase significantly if rates rise (all $875 million is current or short-term debt). To be sure the willingness to take on debt has allowed Dream Finders to rapidly scale its business but it is a major risk factor.

Is Dream Finders Homes a smart investment now?

The homebuilding space is very out-of-favor right now. All of the homebuilders on the list trade for price-to-earnings multiples of 10 or less (Dream Finders has a P/E of just six). And there are clearly some excellent long-term growth opportunities due to the overall U.S. housing shortage.

To be sure Dream Finders is probably the riskiest homebuilder stock in the chart. But it's also the one with the most growth potential if it can keep its momentum going. If you're a patient long-term investor with a relatively high risk tolerance Dream Finders is a stock you may want to put on your radar.",,,,,,,,,,,,

(GS Stanek Racing photo)

WHEATLAND Mo. — Bryan White looks to complete his first full season of racing at Lucas Oil Speedway in style on Saturday by nailing down the O’Reilly Auto Parts USRA Stock Cars track championship.

The 21-year-old from Lebanon takes a two-point lead over 19-year-old Mason Beck into Rempfer Memorial Championship Night. When asked if the battle of young guns is fun or stressful White laughed and said “kind of both.”

“I’d like to be about 20 points ahead of Mason but sometimes that don’t happen” White said. His plan is to approach the final night of Big Adventure RV Weekly Racing Series action the same as usual — even though it basically comes down to which driver finishes ahead of the other.

“You just have to go out and race” White said. “Whatever happens happens. You get to paying attention to where he’s at you’ll mess up and he’ll end up beating you.”

To make things even more interesting White’s dad Rob White is just 12 points behind Bryan. So if the youngsters both have a bit of trouble Rob White is poised to jump ahead of them and celebrate a championship.

“It’s gonna be one of us three depending on who beats who” White said. “We’ll see what happens.”

No matter what happens it’s already been a banner season for White with two feature victories at Lucas Oil Speedway and seven top-five finishes. He has won eight features overall in his USRA Stock Car.

“It’s gone really good; better than I expected really” White said. “I bought a new motor over the winter and it’s really helped out a lot. This division is really fun. Everybody is so close it’s hard to get just one car that’s faster than everybody else. They’re all really competitive.”

White joked that racing with his dad is fun and there’s always some bragging rights involved.

“It’s kind of competitive all week long. If one of us beats the other we get to talk crap all week” he said with a laugh.

White got his start in racing six years ago in a pure stock at Midway Speedway. By the end of the year he won two features and a track championship. He moved into the Midwest mod division the next season before the stock cars caught his eye a couple of years ago.

“Scotty (Allen) started them up at Dallas County and that’s when I had my Midwest mod” White said. “I watched them over there and liked them. I sold my (Midwest mod) over the winter so I could drive a stock car.”

He’s found the USRA Stock Car division not only has competitive racing but camaraderie that seems a notch higher as well.

The Whites and Will Garner always pit together and help each other on race nights.

Beck isn’t far away and while an on-track rival also has offered help if needed.

“We’re all rivals but friends at the same time” White said. “A lot of the other classes it seems if you’re fast and rivals it doesn’t seem like you talk as much in the pits.”

While he would be happy for his dad or Beck if they emerged with the championship White clearly would like to be the one celebrating on Saturday night.

“It would mean a lot. Not everybody can say they won a track championship at Lucas Oil Speedway” White said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8va2Vub3NoYW5ld3MuY29tL2FydGljbGVfMThkMWUwY2UtMjU2MS0xMWVkLWFhMDMtNjM0YmZkZWNiMjNhLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Report: Regency Mall to be partially demolished,"RACINE — The eastern portion of Regency Mall is soon to be demolished with city help so its owner can move forward with a plan for a new grocery store 280 apartments and other redevelopments that could be valued at more than $71 million.

Demolition/construction could begin as soon as next year.

History

Regency Mall’s amenities have been deteriorating for over a decade.

Gone are the days of teenage mallrats wandering from Aladdin’s Castle arcade to Orange Julius and back again.

More than half of the mall is vacant and parts of it have been walled off with its operators essentially accepting that there may never again be a market for more than 870000 square feet of retail space in one building in a postindustrial city like Racine.

Hull Property Group of Augusta Georgia bought the mall in 2016.

The mall opened in 1981 after almost a decade of discussions and planning.

Plans and history

The easternmost part of the building that is to be demolished is where Boston Store had been until it closed in 2018. Boston Store’s closure came after two other anchor stores Sears and J.C. Penney shuttered in 2014. Dunham’s Sports replaced Sears in December 2015 and still operates there today.

In 2019 after operating for about a decade Burlington Coat Factory moved out of the mall leaving two of the four anchor store spots vacant; one of the original anchor store locations has been subdivided into smaller parcels leaving Dunham’s as the only remaining true “anchor.”

An unnamed big-box grocery supercenter store is currently in negotiations to be built in the new site the Business Journal reported.

Racine City Administrator Paul Vornholt deferred questions regarding the plan to Hull Group which did not reply to a request for comment.

The city has long been endeavoring to bring new development to the area as the heyday of American malls has faded. A tax increment district was established surrounding the mall in 2017; that TID is due to expire in 2045.

A TID essentially allows developers to have their taxes offset when they rehabilitate and/or add value to a property incentivizing development projects that may not otherwise get done without government-provided incentives. Typically however those incentives are only provided by the government if the developer reaches certain pre-agreed-upon goals.

There are more than 1000 TIDs in Wisconsin sparking criticism that all these government incentives may not be doing as much to facilitate development as they appear to be. Some of these projects critics say could perhaps be done without tax money but developers say they need government help anyway in order to save their own private funds.

The League of Wisconsin Municipalities a nonprofit association touts TIDs as an effective way to both develop communities and protect taxpayers since TIDs typically don’t involve direct payouts to businesses.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdHVyZ2lzam91cm5hbC5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9wb2xpdGljcy9nb3Zlcm5tZW50LzIwMjIvMDgvMjUvMTAteWVhcnMtbGF0ZXItd2hlcmUtZG9lcy1zdHVyZ2lzLXN0YW5kLW9uLWl0cy0yMDIyLWdvYWxzLzY1NDE3NTMzMDA3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 years later where does Sturgis stand on its 2022 goals?,"By Dan Cherry

Special to the Journal

A decade ago Sturgis city officials developed Sturgis 2022 a series of categorized goals across a variety of topics from community development to business expansion infrastructure to events.

Ten years later many of the goals set forth at the end of the recession have been met while others have yet to see the level of success planned out when the only knowns were the unknowns. In this two-part series Sturgis city manager Michael Hughes and assistant city manager Andrew Kuk recently sat down to examine each goal and to assess where those goals stand 10 years after they were developed.

Origin of Sturgis 2022

Hughes and Kuk said the goals were orchestrated ""with lots of community input and surveying.""

""At that time there was a lot of community desire for increasing the amount of retail franchising"" Hughes said. ""It is a reflection of the input we've seen to the extent the market.""

Following are the Sturgis 2022 goals and the subcategories for each:

'A Great Place to do Business'

A premier community for entrepreneurs

In 2012 when that goal was being put together it was a ""golden age"" for the entrepreneur movement Kuk said.

Momentum for grassroots entrepreneur opportunities slowed as the economy recovered from the recession. Numbers for self-employed business workers have largely been static over the past decade with ""doing business as"" registrations down overall.

Hughes said the vision shifted as the decade continued.

""We were coming out of recession and as the economy got better there was a less desire or need for our entrepreneur programs and initiatives"" Hughes said. ""Our focus at that time was startups transitioning people from other careers to entrepreneurial endeavors and trending jobs.""

While that goal took on a different face than originally envisioned Hughes said ""should we see a downturn we may see that return. It will cycle back. We evolved with the needs at the time.""

The primary commerce center for the area

Retail and commercial developments have spiked over the past 10 years from Wings Etc. to Meijer O'Reilly Auto Parts to Omni Community Credit Union's new building to Wild Bill's Aldi and the Starbucks Illume Wellness Group and WellNow Urgent Care.

The expansion of business seen in Sturgis largely took place in two spurts: 2014-15 and 2021-22.

A leader in the region in creating quality jobs

The largest markets to flourish in Sturgis in recent years are the recreational vehicle manufacturing companies and the marijuana industry purchasing and developing land. Across the city in general Kuk said there has been ""steady internal growth with many local companies growing.""

""We are almost out of the land we had available in 2012"" Kuk said.

In the industrial parks 73 percent of the available land has seen construction expansion or is under construction. Overall 98 percent of the land has been purchased Kuk said.

""We met the target we set"" he said.

With the current industrial park properties largely spoken for the city is looking at its next parcel.

""We are looking toward the future with the business park property we have down by the (Indiana) toll road"" Hughes said.

A highly skilled workforce

The workforce needs of businesses was and remains the primary focus over the past decade Kuk said.

In 2012 Kuk said Sturgis was needing a highly skilled and unskilled worker workforce to strengthen the city.

Hughes said that when the city developed this goal ""we didn't have this type of labor market. Part of why we developed a goal on workforce helps drive a successful economy.""

Educational attainment was behind in almost every category Hughes said. The focus at the time he said ""was 'how do we create quality jobs what are the elements to do so and based on best practices developing a skilled workforce?'""

There has been a movement to focus on trades and training in addition to school to college through cooperative efforts between the manufacturing community and Sturgis High School.

Overall there is more engagement of students in the trades.

""We are building coalitions and partnerships such as Sturgis Neighborhood Program and Sturgis Area Community Foundation and building those partnerships and supporting those initiatives as they take the helm.""

Unemployment in Sturgis has dropped since 2012; however that is largely in part due to the expanding economy rather than local intervention. New hire earnings are also up also a sign of the economy.

Based on 2021 numbers Kuk said Sturgis has about 5.1 percent unemployment down from 8.5 percent in 2012.

""We were targeting 6.5 percent"" Kuk said an attainable goal when set a decade ago.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL3NhbW1pZS1qb25lcy1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNjMzNDIzMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sammie Jones Obituary (2022) - Indianapolis IN - Stuart Mortuary Inc. - Indianapolis,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/sammie-jones-obituary?id=36334230 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL3NhbW1pZS1qb25lcy1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNjMzNDIzMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vbmoxMDE1LmNvbS9uai1idXJnZXItam9pbnQtZ2l2ZXMtcGFyZW50cy1mcmVlZG9tLWZyb20ta2lkcy1kaW5pbmctZGVhbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NJ burger joint gives parents 'freedom from kids' dining deal,"As a native New Jerseyan I appreciate bluntness.

Oil giant Occidental Petroleum (OXY -1.13%) has caught the eye of Warren Buffett. His company Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.84%) (BRK.B 0.67%) has already purchased a more than 20% stake in Occidental. Meanwhile it recently received regulatory approval to buy up to half of the oil company's outstanding shares.

Occidental isn't Buffett's first foray into the oil patch. He once held a sizable position in ConocoPhillips (COP -0.71%). However instead of going back to the well and buying an oil company he already knew quite well Buffett has opted for Occidental this time around to play the boom in oil prices. Here's a look at what it has that's missing at ConocoPhillips.

A head-to-head comparison

ConocoPhillips is one of the world's largest exploration and production (E&P) companies based on output and reserves. It operates in 13 countries and has a diversified asset portfolio. It produced an average of 1.72 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/D) in the second quarter.

Occidental Petroleum is also an international energy company with assets in the U.S. the Middle East and North Africa. It's one of the largest producers in the U.S. with leading positions in the Permian and DJ Basins and the offshore Gulf of Mexico. It produced 1.15 million BOE/D during the second quarter. Occidental also has a midstream and marketing segment and a chemicals subsidiary. The company also formed a low carbon ventures unit to advance leading-edge technologies to grow its business and reduce emissions.

The missing pieces

The big difference is that Occidental Petroleum has more business diversity. ConocoPhillips used to be an integrated energy company. However it spun off its refining midstream marketing and chemicals assets into Phillips 66 in 2012 to focus on growing its E&P business. Now its fortunes rise and fall with oil and gas prices.

While Occidental Petroleum isn't a truly integrated oil company since it doesn't own refining assets it does capture more of the energy value chain than ConocoPhillips. Its midstream segment provides flow assurance for its volumes and helps maximize the value of its oil and gas. Meanwhile its chemicals subsidiary uses products derived from oil and gas to create higher-valued products. These operations also provide Occidental with lower volatile earnings that can help mute some of the sting from oil price volatility.

Another major differentiator is Occidental's low carbon ventures subsidiary. The company formed the dedicated business unit in 2018 and has made several investments to develop and commercialize carbon capture and storage technology develop new products derived from captured carbon and reduce its carbon emissions profile. As part of its investments the company formed 1PointFive to commercialize and deploy large-scale direct air capture (DAC) technology. Occidental is investing upwards of $1 billion to build a large-scale DAC system in the Permian Basin.

Occidental sees enormous market potential in carbon capture. The company estimates it could eventually become a $3 trillion to $5 trillion global market. Furthermore the company believes it could generate a similar amount of earnings and cash flow from carbon capture as it currently does from producing oil and gas. It has already started to monetize its investment. Airbus purchased 400000 tons of carbon removal credits with the option for more in the future. Occidental also agreed to sell 200000 barrels of net zero oil per year to SK Trading International.

While ConocoPhillips is making investments to reduce its emissions and develop future low-carbon energy businesses including carbon capture and hydrogen it's not as far along as Occidental and it could fall behind Occidental which is emerging as a leader in carbon capture.

Buffett's bet on Occidental appears to be on more than oil prices

Warren Buffett could have picked any oil stock to make a wager on higher oil prices including going back to the well with ConocoPhillips. Instead he selected Occidental Petroleum which offers upside to crude prices and the future of the energy market via its carbon capture investments. That makes it stand out as a potentially better option for investors seeking exposure to the upside of oil prices from a company with a more visible path to sustainability.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiugFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nbG9iZW5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2UvMjAyMi8wOC8yNS8yNTA0NTYwLzAvZW4vT2NjaWRlbnRhbC0xUG9pbnRGaXZlLXRvLUJlZ2luLUNvbnN0cnVjdGlvbi1vZi1Xb3JsZC1zLUxhcmdlc3QtRGlyZWN0LUFpci1DYXB0dXJlLVBsYW50LWluLXRoZS1UZXhhcy1QZXJtaWFuLUJhc2luLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Occidental 1PointFive to Begin Construction of World's,"Plant will advance large-scale carbon capture to help Oxy and others reduce emissions and accelerate their respective paths to net zero



Captured carbon can be safely and securely sequestered in saline formations or used to produce low carbon products

HOUSTON Aug. 25 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Occidental (NYSE: OXY) and its subsidiary 1PointFive today announced they plan to begin detailed engineering and early site construction for their first large-scale Direct Air Capture (DAC) plant in Ector County Texas near Oxy’s portfolio of acreage and infrastructure that are conducive to safe and secure storage of carbon dioxide.

The first stage of construction which includes site preparation and road work is scheduled to begin in the third quarter of 2022 and start-up is expected in late 2024. Upon completion the first DAC plant will be the world’s largest of its kind and would be an important step in advancing Oxy’s low-carbon strategy to deliver large-scale carbon management solutions that accelerate a net-zero economy. Once operational the plant is expected to capture up to 500000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year with the capability to scale up to 1 million metric tons per year. 1PointFive has announced a scenario to deploy 70 DAC facilities worldwide by 2035 under current compliance and market scenarios.

The decision to proceed with construction follows the successful completion of a Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) study and extensive testing and validation at the Carbon Engineering Innovation Centre. 1PointFive partnered with Carbon Engineering a climate solutions company to commercialize and deploy DAC technology at scale. 1PointFive has also agreed on substantive terms with Worley for engineering procurement and construction (EPC) services and expects to work toward a definitive agreement for the EPC contract by the end of the year.

1PointFive and Carbon Engineering continue to progress innovation workstreams to improve the DAC technology at the Innovation Centre. The focus is on carbon capture and energy efficiency as well as operating cost improvements during the life of the plant.

“The construction of Oxy’s first DAC plant is an important milestone on the pathway to achieving our net-zero ambitions and helping the world meet the Paris Agreement’s climate goals” said Vicki Hollub President and CEO Oxy. “We are fortunate to partner with Carbon Engineering and Worley who share our vision in creating a carbon removal industry that can accelerate the path to net zero.”

“Construction of this transformative facility begins our journey toward providing commercial-scale DAC solutions that reduce and remove carbon emissions” said Richard Jackson President U.S. Onshore Resources and Carbon Management Operations Oxy. “This plant’s development is rooted in our carbon management expertise strong record of delivering major projects and existing infrastructure that supports the commercialization of carbon capture utilization and storage technologies. This plant could also anchor future low carbon projects and strengthen our portfolio of carbon management solutions.”

“Carbon Engineering has been innovating for more than a decade to deliver climate solutions at megaton scale” said Daniel Friedmann CEO Carbon Engineering. “Now with construction starting on this first large-scale facility we are seeing our vision become a reality. In collaboration with our partners at 1PointFive and Oxy today marks a pivotal moment in the deployment of Carbon Engineering’s large-scale Direct Air Capture solutions.”

The plant is expected to provide cost-effective solutions that hard-to-decarbonize industries can use in conjunction with their own emissions reduction programs to help achieve net zero. Captured carbon dioxide can be safely sequestered deep underground in saline formations or used in the production of hydrocarbons to enable lower-carbon or net-zero transportation fuels and in products like chemicals and building materials.

1PointFive has advanced product sales for the plant including carbon removal credit purchases from Airbus Shopify and ThermoFisher and Oxy reached an offtake agreement with SK Trading International for an opportunity to purchase net-zero oil.

Oxy also entered into an agreement with Origis Energy to provide zero-emission solar power for the DAC plant and other projects in the Permian Basin.

The project is expected to employ more than 1000 people during the construction phase and up to 75 once operational. The Inflation Reduction Act’s increased incentives will further accelerate DAC deployment as a solution to help achieve net zero.

On January 19 a car bomb exploded in the small city of Saravena in the department of Arauca in eastern Colombia only a few miles from the border with Venezuela. The blast killed one person and wounded at least 15 others and seemed to have been targeting the headquarters of several local human rights organizations. The attack was not an isolated case. According to the United Nations at least 130 people have been killed and another 3000 have been displaced in the first few months of 2022. Arauca is yet again at the center of a deadly conflict involving left-wing guerrillas paramilitaries multinational corporations and the U.S. government.

In 2020 President Trump sent 50 U.S. special forces personnel to train and advise Colombian forces in strategic regions including the department of Arauca. The following year the United States provided Colombia with five UH-1 Bell Huey helicopters and 20 M1117 armored security vehicles in an effort to increase military capabilities. In December Colombia’s Defense Minister Diego Molano announced that the new fleet of military vehicles would be deployed to the country’s north-eastern department of Arauca near the border with Venezuela along with two new military bases.

Why has Arauca been singled out for this “enhanced” security policy? One answer is oil.

War in Colombia’s Oil Frontier

Oil was first discovered in Colombia in 1866 near the port city of Barranquilla. Ten years later more was found around the Gulf of Urabá near the Panamanian border but serious exploitation did not take place until 1922 after the ratification of the Urrutia-Thomson Treaty between Colombia and the United States. This agreement brought to a close the diplomatic imbroglio caused by U.S. support for the Panamanian separatists who revolted against Colombia in 1903 and paved the way for massive U.S. investment in Colombian banana plantations and oil fields. Soon Tropical Oil a subsidiary of Standard Oil began production in the central Magdalena Valley and built a refinery complex in the city of Barrancabermeja.

In 1983 tests on wells dug by Ecopetrol and Occidental Petroleum known as OXY at Caño Limón in Cravo Norte Arauca indicated that oil reserves in that location amounted to 500 million barrels. By 1994 the flow was more than a million barrels a day and the boom in Colombia’s oil frontier was underway.

Sustained guerrilla warfare in Arauca dates back to the beginning of La Violencia when Liberal rebels incensed by the 1948 assassination of populist leader Jorge Eliécer Gaitán began a virtually unwinnable struggle against the Conservatives who had long held power. On June 13 1953 army commander Lt. General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla seized power and immediately called for an end of civil strife. He offered amnesty to nearly all the guerrillas but banned the Communist party. Many were left dissatisfied by the reparations offered and their inability to participate politically. In the late 1950 the FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) and the ELN (National Liberation Army) reorganized their operations. Soon they came to dominate much of the border region where the central government had never established a strong presence.

The exploitation of petroleum in Arauca beginning in the late 1980s exacerbated the armed conflict. Both leftist guerrilla and rightwing paramilitary groups fortified themselves economically and militarily. The FARC and ELN were quick to capitalize on the opportunities to open a new front in their war against the central government and extract economic resources offered by the presence of multinational corporations (MNCs) exploring for oil. In Arauca oil pumped through the Caño Limón-Coveñas pipeline became a major target for both guerrilla forces. According to a top OXY executive rebels blew up the pipeline 460 times between 1985 and 1997.

However it is not only the illegal armed actors that are responsible for the bloodshed in Arauca. The Colombian Armed Forces and indirectly U.S. aid and OXY have worsened the suffering for innocent Colombians. In 1998 the Colombian Armed Forces supported by U.S. antidrug aid and a private U.S. surveillance company with logistical support and equipment from Occidental used U.S. cluster munition to bomb the small village of Santo Domingo killing 18 innocent civilians including 7 children and wounding more than 25 others.

On August 20 2004 Isabel Hilton a reporter for The Guardian observed that “a complex mosaic of armed groups—rightwing paramilitaries and the army often working closely together and leftwing guerrillas—were struggling for control of the lucrative pipeline and cocaine routes.” In response President Álvaro Uribe declared a special security zone around the three northern municipalities of the department where the oil pipeline is located and OXY and the U.S. government began funding the Colombian army’s 18th Brigade the main government force in the zone. Despite this effort security in the region did not increase and civilians who assumed any position of leadership such as school teachers health workers and union activists were being killed in “appalling numbers.”

Blood and Oil: U.S. Counterinsurgency Policy in Arauca

The United States began funding and training the Colombian military in the late 1950s and early 1960s. U.S. military officials instructed the Colombian armed forces to target armed and unarmed actors suspected of harboring communist sympathies or “subversive thoughts.”

Alongside these threats to U.S. political influence in Colombia were specific economic interests. In 1959 for example Colombia was one of the largest markets in South America for U.S. direct foreign investment.

Under the Clinton administration the United States began sending billions of dollars in military aid to Colombia. As part of this multi-year counter-narcotics package called Plan Colombia the United States sent $98 million to train approximately 4000 Colombian military personnel to protect the OXY-owned Caño Limón pipeline despite the military’s well-documented ties to right-wing paramilitary death squads. According to a report by Human Rights Watch these paramilitary groups were ”...fully integrated into the army's battle strategy coordinated with its soldiers in the field and linked to government units via intelligence supplies radios weapons cash and common purpose that they effectively constitute a sixth division of the army.”

In 2020 the Carlyle Group one of the most important investment groups in the world with over $221 billion in assets purchased all of OXY's onshore continental assets for $825 million dollars. Despite OXY’s claims of environmental sustainability and social responsibility the communities in Arauca are soundly opposed to their extractivist activities that threaten to destroy the local ecosystem and engulf the region in an armed struggle over control of the region’s vast oil reserves.

Corporate Plunder and Popular Resistance

The Colombian government has issued sweeping oil concessions in the department of Arauca some estimate as much as 80 percent of Arauca’s territory. By taking advantage of institutional weakness and bribing local officials transnational corporations like OXY have been able to ignore environmental regulations dumping tens of thousands of barrels of contaminated water into the flood zones of Caño Limón and the Arauca River destroying the vegetation and biological resources in the headwaters of the Cinaruco and Capanaparo rivers.

“[OXY] has a whole history of serious impacts on the lives of the Colombian people and especially the people of Arauca” said Jose Vicente Murrillo a national spokesperson for the Cumbre Agraria Campesina Étnica y Popular (Agrarian Peasant Ethnic and Popular Summit) and a member of Congreso de los Pueblos (Peoples Congress) one of the groups targeted by the car-bomb attack on January 19. He called OXY’s exploration and exploitation of the Caño Limón oil field in Laguna de Lipa an “ecocide” adding ”By drying up the lagoon and dispossesing Indigenous communities from their spiritual territory they were eliminated spiritually [...] thats why we consider that there was a genocide on top of the ecocide of the species of flora and fauna that were there.”

A U.S.-backed policy of militarization is clearly underway in Arauca. In October 2021 the U.S. Southern Command donated 20 M1117 armored security vehicles in a handover ceremony at the Buenavista Military Fort. The 20 M1117 ASVs showcased during the ceremony are part of the first of 145 vehicles scheduled to be delivered to Colombia nearly doubling Colombia’s current fleet of armored vehicles. A month later on January 3 Colombian President Ivan Duque sent over 680 troops to the department of Arauca joining the nearly 7000 already deployed to the border region. On March 10 President Joe Biden designated Colombia as a major non-NATO ally paving the way for even greater military cooperation.

Multinational corporations like OXY have even financed special investigation units within the Attorney General’s office to investigate acts of sabotage against the pipeline however these special units have later been weaponized to criminalize and stigmatize civil society organizations opposed to their interests.

“If you look at all the investigations that these special units have carried out they are cases that have been fabricated orchestrated and framed [...] that in 99 percent of cases are proven to be false by federal courts” said Murillo “this means [OXY] is involved in the armed conflict but also involved in the social and political conflict because they are injecting resources for structures that are dedicated to the stigmatization persecution and criminalization of social movements in Arauca.”

Despite decades of U.S.-funded counterinsurgency warfare and criminalization popular movements in Arauca remain some of the strongest in the country. In order to protect their territory and confront large oil interests more than 80 local grassroots organizations led an International Humanitarian Caravan to Arauca. The “Caravan for Life in Arauca” which took place in March 2022 sought to raise awareness and stand in solidarity with the people of Arauca as they denounced the ongoing humanitarian crisis happening in the region.

“It’s incredible how state policies reflect its incapacity to guarantee comprehensive rights to the Araucanos” said Lidia Afanador one of the Caravan’s members. “This caravan comes to accompany to listen and to support the organizations that live and are present in the department of Arauca.”

On August 7 Colombia’s new leftist government led by Gustavo Petro took power. During the campaign Petro vowed to end Colombia’s historic dependence on fossil fuel extraction and move towards a green economy. He also centered the need to negotiate a peaceful end to the armed conflict with groups like the ELN and strive towards building “total peace” in the country. This would have enormous impacts across Colombia especially oil-rich regions like Arauca. However Petro and his government face stiff opposition from multinationals and the United States whose geopolitical interests have fueled conflict in Arauca for decades.

Despite Biden's campaign rhetoric about environmental sustainability his administration has doubled down on interventionist policies set in motion by the Clinton administration in the early 2000s opening up conflict-ridden regions in Colombia to foreign multinationals. The Biden administration has asked Colombia to increase oil exports to the United States by 40000 barrels per day. The move comes as part of a U.S. diplomatic push to secure global oil supplies and keep a lid on global energy prices after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. These policies benefit corporations seeking profits at the expense of the environment and the lives of people already struggling to build peace after decades of civil war. Far from being a solution to Colombia’s armed conflict further militarizing the region could prove to be the catalyst for a new wave of violence in Colombia.

“The construction of Oxy’s first DAC (direct air capture) plant is an important milestone on the pathway to achieving our net-zero ambitions and helping the world meet the Paris Agreement’s climate goals” Oxy President and CEO Vicki Hollub commented in the release.

Occidental said its subsidiary 1PointFive will begin engineering and early site construction on the plant in the third quarter. The plant which will deploy direct air capture technology developed by Carbon Engineering Ltd. is set to be located in Ector County Texas near Oxy’s portfolio of acreage and infrastructure in the Permian Basin.

“Carbon Engineering has been innovating for more than a decade to deliver climate solutions at megaton scale” said Daniel Friedmann CEO of Carbon Engineering. “Now with construction starting on this first large-scale facility we are seeing our vision become a reality.”

“The construction of Oxy’s first DAC (direct air capture) plant is an important milestone on the pathway to achieving our net-zero ambitions and helping the world meet the Paris Agreement’s climate goals.”—Vicki Hollub Occidental Petroleum Corp.

Carbon Engineering a climate solutions company based in Canada is focused on the global deployment of large-scale direct air capture technology that captures CO₂ out of the atmosphere so it can be permanently stored deep underground or used to produce clean affordable transportation fuels.

“In collaboration with our partners at 1PointFive and Oxy today marks a pivotal moment in the deployment of Carbon Engineering’s large-scale direct air capture solutions” Friedmann added.

1PointFive has also agreed on substantive terms with Worley for engineering procurement and construction (EPC) services and expects to work toward a definitive agreement for the EPC contract by the end of the year.

The project is expected to employ more than 1000 people during the construction phase and up to 75 once operational expected in late 2024.

Upon completion the first DAC plant will be the world’s largest of its kind. It would be an essential step in advancing Oxy’s low-carbon strategy to deliver large-scale carbon management solutions that accelerate a net-zero economy.

Once operational the plant is expected to capture up to 500000 metric tons of CO₂ per year with the capability to scale up to 1 million metric tons per year. 1PointFive has announced a scenario to deploy 70 DAC facilities worldwide by 2035 under current compliance and market scenarios.

The Inflation Reduction Act’s increased incentives will further accelerate DAC deployment as a solution to help achieve net zero the Occidental release noted.

“Construction of this transformative facility begins our journey toward providing commercial-scale DAC solutions that reduce and remove carbon emissions” said Richard Jackson president of U.S. onshore resources and carbon management operations at Oxy.

“This plant could also anchor future low-carbon projects and strengthen our portfolio of carbon management solutions” Jackson added.

1PointFive has advanced product sales for the plant including carbon removal credit purchases from Airbus Shopify and ThermoFisher. Oxy also reached an offtake agreement with SK Trading International for an opportunity to purchase net-zero oil.

Additionally Oxy entered into an agreement with Origis Energy to provide zero-emission solar power for the DAC plant and other projects in the Permian Basin.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vamFjb2Jpbi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC9qb2UtbWFuY2hpbi1pcmEtZm9zc2lsLWZ1ZWwtZG9ub3Jz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Joe Manchin Is a Very Good Friend to His Fossil Fuel Donors,"It also sheds light on a contradiction at the heart of Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act (IRA): a bill sold to the public as a climate solution includes significant resources for the oil and gas industry fueling the climate crisis.

The situation illustrates the continued power of fossil fuel industry lobbyists to shape legislation even in an era when scientists say that industry’s products are destroying the livable ecosystem.

Critics say the provision — tax credits for unproven carbon capture technologies — is a handout to the oil and gas industry that could end up prolonging fossil fuel use instead of accelerating a transition to renewable energy. In addition Manchin has reportedly negotiated a side deal for separate legislation that could also enrich that same fossil fuel industry donor.

While forcing his fellow Democrats to scale back their climate and health care legislation Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) made sure the bill included a lucrative gift for his biggest donor: a fossil fuel company whose CEO recently called the legislative gift a potential “game changer” for its business.

“A Game Changer”

Many business interests have worked to build relationships with Manchin in recent years as he has become a key figure in deciding what Congress can and cannot pass. But none have done so more than the Houston-based oil and gas pipeline company Enterprise Products Partners.

Since the beginning of this Congress Enterprise Products’ executives employees and political action committee (PAC) have donated at least $159000 to Manchin’s campaign and leadership PAC making the company the senator’s top donor entity this election cycle according to OpenSecrets.

The company also now employs Manchin’s son-in-law. Marshall Roberts who is married to Manchin’s daughter Brooke has worked for Enterprise Products since June 2020 most recently as a senior manager for commercial refined products according to his LinkedIn page.

Now thanks to language in the reconciliation bill that Manchin negotiated with Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) Enterprise Products’ investment in the senator might soon pay off.

The IRA signed last week expands and extends a tax credit known as 45Q for companies that use technologies to capture carbon oxide that they would normally release into the atmosphere. More than five hundred environmental organizations signed a letter warning that the unproven technology “delays the needed transition away from fossil fuels and other combustible energy sources and poses significant new environmental health and safety risks.”

But Manchin claimed credit for the subsidies in a letter to the Virginia Coal Association and they were included in the bill — just as his donor Enterprise Products is positioned to profit off them.

In April Enterprise Products signed a letter of intent with Oxy Low Carbon Ventures a subsidiary of oil giant Occidental Petroleum to develop and commercialize a joint carbon capture and storage (CCS) service that they plan to sell to power plants and refineries initially focusing on those in the industrial corridor spanning from Houston to Beaumont and Port Arthur Texas.

Enterprise Products is most excited about a line in the bill that increases the credit for carbon oxide that is captured and stored underground from its current rate of $50 per metric ton to $85 per metric ton. According to Enterprise Products CEO Randy Fowler such changes could be “a game changer” for their joint project with Oxy.

“In our efforts to commercialize a carbon sequestration system with Oxy we believe the proposed changes to the 45Q credits could be a game changer for postcombustion emitting customers” Fowler said on August 3 during the company’s quarterly earnings call:

It was harder to come in or more of a challenge to come in and commercialize the carbon sequestration projects and attract these customers when the existing 45Q program was only paying $50 per metric ton and had no direct pay options.

The IRA also allows companies like Enterprise Products to claim 45Q credits as direct pay meaning they can treat the credits like overpayments on their taxes and claim cash payments from the government annually. And the bill opens up the credits to smaller power plants and extends the date to qualify for the credits by seven years.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates the IRA’s changes to the 45Q tax credit will cost the government $3.2 billion over the next ten years.

Although many environmental groups oppose government investments in carbon capture projects the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change which reviews climate science literature wrote in its April report on climate mitigation that carbon capture technologies would likely be needed to avoid the most dire consequences of global warming. As the MIT Technology Review noted “The UN report suggests that it’s now nearly impossible to prevent 1.5 degree Celsius of global warming without substantial efforts to remove carbon — and very very difficult to steer clear of 2 degrees Celsius without it as well.”

Enterprise Products is just one of many oil and gas companies that stand to benefit from the IRA’s provisions on carbon capture technologies and other matters. The new law also mandates new oil and gas leasing in the Gulf of Mexico and offshore of Alaska and stipulates that any federal lands and offshore areas used for renewable energy development must also be available for fossil fuel projects.

The oil and gas industry has been one of Manchin’s top donor industries throughout his congressional career giving him nearly $1.2 million according to OpenSecrets. So far this election cycle Manchin is the top congressional recipient of oil and gas industry money with at least $694000 in donations from PACs and employees in the industry."

But the Old Dominion University student didn't stop there. She wanted to get even more out of her summer.

So she joined a regional program called Summer 757 that helps interns develop workplace skills create community ties and experience Hampton Roads culture.

She loved it.

""Summer 757 has allowed me to connect with like-minded students who are in the same position as I am going to school and wanting to do something great in our future"" said Williams a cybersecurity major and rising senior from Norfolk. It also helped her develop skills such as networking and resume writing she said.

In 2019 the Hampton Roads Workforce Council identified a growing labor shortage in the region. In response leaders created the Campus 757 division which in turn developed the summer program.

Campus 757 teams with industry higher education and community organizations to attract college students to the region and encourage them to stay after they graduate Director Jaedda Hall said.

And from June to August each year Campus 757 supports interns through Summer 757. A blend of professional development programs business tours and social events the gatherings are a chance for students to meet local businesspeople - and one another.

""A lot of times when you're interning you just kind of stay to yourself or stay within your company and you don't really branch out to meet other people and learn more about that area that you're interning in"" Hall said.

Williams especially enjoyed the kickoff event in June held at Apex Entertainment in Virginia Beach.

""I was able to meet students from TCC ODU Thomas Nelson Regent University students that I would probably never have met. We're still cordial to this day"" Williams said. ""We check up on each other to see how we're doing within our internships and also as young professionals.""

Other summer get-togethers included workshops on soft skills - communication in the workplace time management maintaining a work/life balance - a taco night at Pelon's Baja Grill a volunteer day at the Chesapeake Humane Society and a virtual series called Mentor Monday during which Hall interviewed a local businessperson each week.

While taking part in Summer 757 Williams held down a demanding job at NASA Langley as an information technology intern in the Office of Audits within the Office of the Inspector General. There she helped wrap up a cyber investigation of an IT incident and worked on an audit of NASA's use of artificial intelligence.

With another academic year to go Williams has compiled an impressive list of achievements. She earned an Associate of Applied Science degree in cybersecurity at Tidewater Community College. She is an ODU Cyber LeADERS Scholar and a National Science Foundation CyberCorps SFS (Scholarship for Service) Scholar. She has worked at the U.S. Coast Guard Services Command. And in May 2021 she introduced President Joe Biden when he visited TCC.

Judging by her resume Williams is going places. But she said the Summer 757 program has made her more likely to stay in the area after she graduates.

""Being a Hampton Roads native you think you know everything"" she said with a laugh. ""But the events opened my eyes to the different areas and the different companies that are here that I didn't know about or had not paid much attention to.""

She fully endorses Summer 757 not only for interns from elsewhere but for locals like her.

""More students should know about it"" she said.

Applications for next year's Summer 757 will be posted in January at the program's website.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.

The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.

Currently Saia has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) while Old Dominion Freight Line has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates so investors should rest assured that SAIA has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.

Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.

Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics including the popular P/E ratio as well as the P/S ratio earnings yield cash flow per share and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.

SAIA currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.84 while ODFL has a forward P/E of 24.74. We also note that SAIA has a PEG ratio of 0.77. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. ODFL currently has a PEG ratio of 1.46.

Another notable valuation metric for SAIA is its P/B ratio of 4.14. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison ODFL has a P/B of 9.31.

These metrics and several others help SAIA earn a Value grade of B while ODFL has been given a Value grade of D.

SAIA sticks out from ODFL in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models so value investors will likely feel that SAIA is the better option right now.

NEW YORK Aug. 24 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- John Hunt Global Creative Chair at TBWA\Worldwide co-founder of the internationally recognized South African agency TBWA\Hunt\Lascaris and award-winning author and playwright will be inducted into The One Club for Creativity's Creative Hall of Fame on October 27th in New York.

The Creative Hall of Fame has a rich heritage of honoring the lifetime achievements of creative luminaries in all forms of advertising and design beginning with the induction of Leo Burnett in 1961 and TBWA\Media Arts Lab's Lee Clow in 1997. Hunt's fellow inductees in the class of 2022 are Nancy Vonk Janet Kestin Carol H. Williams Joe Duffy and Cheryl D. Miller. The black-tie Creative Hall of Fame induction ceremony which is a fundraising gala to support The One Club's many global DE&I programs will take place at Tisch Skylights at The Shed Hudson Yards in New York.

""John Hunt is most deserving of this honor"" said Kevin Swanepoel CEO The One Club. ""He has been a champion of creativity for Africa and has used creativity to build iconic brands while advancing democracy human rights and human welfare. He is the very definition of a creative giant. John joins a group of inductees who have influenced culture uplifted underrepresented groups and inspired the next generation of creative thinkers and doers. We are honored to celebrate him alongside our other inductees in October.""

In 1983 Hunt and his partner Reg Lascaris founded Hunt\Lascaris with the ambition to be the first world-class agency out of Africa. With the mantra ""Life's too short to be mediocre"" they created bold and breakthrough work that could only be from Africa but routinely gained worldwide attention and recognition. Clients included BMW Nando's South African Airways and The Zimbabwean's ""Trillion Dollar Campaign"" which raised awareness of the newspaper and the corruption within the Mugabe regime around the world and became the most awarded campaign of all time after sweeping the awards at The One Show Cannes Lions The Clio Awards ADC and D&AD.

Shortly after its founding Hunt\Lascaris sought an international partner to accelerate its growth. TBWA was the ideal match with its high creative standards entrepreneurial spirit and founder culture and a decades long partnership was born.

The agency has continued to create bold award-winning work including ""Breaking Ballet"" for the Joburg Ballet which brought the art form to an entirely new generation of fans and earned a Gold Lion and South Africa's first-ever Data Lion at Cannes; and ""Blame No More"" which won five Cannes Lions in 2020 including a Gold and South Africa's first-ever Glass Lion.

Proof that advertising can make the world a better place Hunt was intimately involved in Nelson Mandela's first ANC election campaign in 1993. Although harrowing at the time this unique moment in history ushered South Africa into the light of democracy. He was also involved in creating iconic work for the First HIV AIDS campaign in South Africa. TBWA\Hunt\Lascaris was named Agency of the Century in 2000 and Agency of the Decade in 2010 the same year that work for The Zimbabwean Newspaper gained worldwide recognition.

""I'm deeply honored to receive this recognition from The One Show"" said Hunt. ""In truth though it's a team award. It belongs just as much to all the co-workers clients and organizations I've worked with over the years. Ultimately it's their trust that turned seemingly impossible ideas into reality. No doubt creativity can make the world a better place. But it's so much more powerful when played as a team sport.""

Troy Ruhanen CEO TBWA\Worldwide added ""I have such tremendous respect for John not just for what he has achieved but more importantly how he has gone about it. He inspires us continues to be our creative north star and has given so much to our company industry and society. John's integrity generosity and talent are matched only by his enormous heart. We are immensely proud to see him join the Creative Hall of Fame.""

In 2003 Hunt moved to TBWA's New York headquarters to assume the role of Worldwide Creative Director becoming a creative compass for the agency collective helping to reshape the TBWA collective to think less about ads and more about ideas. Upon arriving in New York Hunt founded the TBWA Young Bloods creative residency program and a year later began the ""SWAT"" initiative a program that ensures a global answer to the creative questions often asked by worldwide clients. In 2021 TBWA re-introduced the Young Bloods program with a focus on promising talent from historically underrepresented groups. Hunt returned to South Africa in 2006 to continue his Worldwide role from Johannesburg.

In 1996 he was inducted into the South African Advertising Hall of Fame and a year later received the Financial Mail's Long Term Achievement Award. Hunt has served as juror across every major industry awards show including as President of the Cannes Film Press & Outdoor Advertising Festival in 2005. He has also found time to write a number of television and theatre plays and books. He was named South African Playwright of the Year for Vid Alex a play that condemned censorship during the apartheid years and has also published a book The Art of the Idea: And How It Can Change Your Life.

Omnicom Media Group (OMG) Yahoo and Amplified Intelligence released a study Thursday that focuses on identifying when consumers pay attention to ads -- and when they don't.

Findings from the research conducted across Yahoo’s digital properties showed that 53% of all ad formats studied met viewability standards but achieved less than 1 second of active attention.

The study shows that viewability and attention are not the same. The research shows how viewability is device-driven -- determined by how and where the ad gets loaded on the screen -- while attention is human-driven by how the viewer responds to the ad served on the screen.

Caitriona Henry global brand strategy lead at OMD Worldwide believes it's important to optimize marketing strategies to earn higher levels of consumer attention. It's something OMD and Amplified Intelligence have been working on for the past two years to establish attention key performance indicators (KPIs).

All respondents for the study were recruited and volunteered. Amplified Intelligence's technology collected the data using facial footage from phone cameras and metadata on viewability scroll patterns sound and phone orientation.

Altogether responses to 128000 mobile web advertisements were categorized into three levels of attention such as active eyes on the ad; passive eyes on screen not on ad; and non-eyes eyes not on screen or ad.

Research was conducted in the U.S. Canada the United Kingdom and Australia.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbXBhaWduYXNpYS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9kZW50c3Utc2Vlcy10cmVtZW5kb3VzLWNvbXBldGl0aXZlLWFkdmFudGFnZS1pbi1vZmZzaG9yaW5nLTEwLTAwMC1qb2JzLzQ4MTEyM9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dentsu sees ‘tremendous competitive advantage’ in offshoring 10000 jobs | Advertising,"Dentsu International is creating thousands of jobs offshore because the agency group sees a “tremendous competitive advantage” at a time when clients need to make savings to cope with rising inflation.

The international arm of Dentsu which employs about 45000 people outside its home market of Japan already has 7500 staff or 17% of its workforce in cheaper locations. By the end of 2022 this should rise to 10000 or about 20%.

In a sign of the importance of offshoring Hiroshi Igarashi the chief executive of Dentsu Group Inc the Japanese parent company outlined the rationale at its recent Q2 earnings presentation.

The company has also set up a new division Dentsu Global Services to manage its low-cost operations which are based in 18 “delivery centres” around the world.

Offshoring – the practice of multinationals moving work to cheaper locations – usually involves a mix of offshore locations which are often a long distance away from a client or customer and nearshore locations which tend to be a shorter distance away.

Dentsu Global Services’ biggest offshore operation is in India where more than two-thirds of its staff are employed and it also has a significant offshore presence in the Philippines.

The division’s most important nearshore delivery centres are in Bulgaria Portugal and Spain for the EMEA region and Argentina and Brazil for the Americas. Its other nearshore locations include the Czech Republic Serbia and Columbia.

A slide in the earnings presentation showed a breakdown by staff numbers with 6000 people in India 500 in Asia Pacific 850 in EMEA and 300 in the Americas.

In addition to Dentsu International's existing 7500-strong offshore workforce Dentsu Japan employs about 700 staff in low-cost locations taking the current global total to 8350 and likely pushing it closer to 11000 by the end of 2022.

Increased cost pressures

Wendy Clark the chief executive of Dentsu International said it is “increasingly” talking to clients about moving work to offshore and nearshore locations because “there are increased cost pressures in our business” and it is “crucial for us to have commercial viability and also access to key talent”.

She claimed its growing offshore workforce is “particularly advantageous” because it competes with some global agency rivals that have only a small percentage in the “low single digits” working in offshore locations.

“You can see that this really becomes quite a differentiator for us and certainly in a period where cost becomes more of a focus with our clients we see a tremendous competitive advantage” she told investors.

Dentsu International faces competition from not only global agency rivals but also consulting giants such as Accenture which has been moving into marketing services and has a substantial workforce in India.

Michael Komasinski the global chief executive of Merkle Dentsu International’s customer experience agency is the executive sponsor of Dentsu Global Services.

Dentsu has said it wants customer experience – one of three key service lines alongside creative and media – to generate 50% of international revenue by 2024 and it is thought to be a key driver for the expansion of Dentsu Global Services.

“High quality” services

Igarashi said offshoring allows Dentsu to “deliver high-quality advertising marketing analytics and technology services to our clients in a cost-effective manner”.

The company’s “offshore centres in India are easily scalable and provide coverage to all English-speaking markets and service lines and have 24-hour coverage” while nearshore operations are important because they “can support regional markets that have specific language and time zone coverage needs and local data privacy requirements”.

He went on: “We have a skilled talent base ranging from recent graduates to more seasoned professionals with a short timeframe to recruit on-board and train. This model drives benefits for clients our people and our business.”

These benefits include diversity of thinking increased speed to market and access to a larger talent pool and more advanced technological capabilities as well as reduced costs according to Dentsu.

Offshoring of jobs has potential to reshape industry

Nick Priday chief financial officer of Dentsu International pointed out offshore and nearshore delivery centres are “very important in making sure we’re competitive in terms of pricing for clients” but also help to improve the overall efficiency of the business.

Some internal functions such as finance and human resources can be managed at these cheaper locations which means the agency group is able to standardise its processes in a “consistent manner at scale” globally according to Priday.

“Obviously that gives us much better transparency much better control” he said. “We use KPIs and scorecards a lot to really help with our margin improvement initiatives really focusing on the cost-to-serve ratio across our business functions and making sure that’s fit for purpose delivering with quality service at an appropriate cost.”

Dentsu has about 65000 staff including Japan and is the world’s fourth largest agency group behind WPP Publicis Groupe and Omnicom. Together with Interpublic and Havas the so-called “big six” employ more than 400000 people.

An industry-wide move to relocate jobs to cheaper locations has the potential to reshape the global marketing services sector because it could mean there will be fewer roles in more expensive established global hubs such as London New York and Tokyo.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vbXVtYnJlbGxhLmNvbS5hdS9waGQtc3lkbmV5LXNoaW5lcy1zcG90bGlnaHQtb24tcnlhbi1hbWJyb3NlLXdoby1iZWNvbWVzLWdyb3VwLWludmVzdG1lbnQtZGlyZWN0b3ItNzUyODQ20gF1aHR0cHM6Ly9tdW1icmVsbGEuY29tLmF1L3BoZC1zeWRuZXktc2hpbmVzLXNwb3RsaWdodC1vbi1yeWFuLWFtYnJvc2Utd2hvLWJlY29tZXMtZ3JvdXAtaW52ZXN0bWVudC1kaXJlY3Rvci03NTI4NDYvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PHD Sydney shines spotlight on Ryan Ambrose who becomes group investment director,"PHD Sydney has appointed Ryan Ambrose as its new group investment director effective immediately.

The newly signed CHIPS and Science Act represents a much-anticipated boon for the U.S. semiconductor industry providing $52 billion to implement the CHIPS for America Act  which Congress enacted on the first day of 2021. While the earlier act established a series of initiatives to support R&D and subsidize manufacturing until now agencies have not had the funding to take more than preliminary steps.

Of the new law’s total appropriation $39 billion is allocated over five years to encourage semiconductor manufacturers to finance U.S.-based fabrication equipment and facilities or “fabs.” It also supplements that money with a tax credit that was not included in the original CHIPS law. In addition it allocates $11 billion to the Department of Commerce for a set of new R&D programs and $2 billion to the Department of Defense to create a National Network for Microelectronics R&D.

Federal agencies are now deliberating over how to implement the initiatives and companies and state officials are already jockeying to win shares of the funds. Stakeholders are also considering what follow-on steps are necessary to ensure the law achieves its aims with workforce issues particularly immigration reform emerging as a focus for intense advocacy.

Fab subsidies

Concerns have been mounting in recent years about the concentration of semiconductor manufacturing in Asia especially Taiwan. Enticed by promises of support from federal and local governments over the past two years several companies announced plans for new fabs in existing chip-manufacturing centers such as Arizona and Texas and in new regions including a major complex Intel intends to build near Columbus Ohio.

Cutting-edge fabs are extremely expensive requiring highly advanced manufacturing equipment and a specialized workforce. Policymakers hope the act’s financial incentives will compete with those offered by other nations and encourage companies to further scale up their U.S. investments.

Intel’s initial commitment in Ohio was for $20 billion but the company has said the CHIPS Act incentives could enable it to expand its investment there to $100 billion. In conjunction with the signing of the CHIPS Act this month Micron announced it will spend $40 billion through 2030 on manufacturing facilities in the U.S. as part of its plans to invest $150 billion globally and GlobalFoundries announced it will expand a plant in New York. Among prospective investments that may also be spurred by the act Samsung has recently floated plans to build plants in Texas projected to cost almost $200 billion.

These companies will be able to use the new tax credit created by the act to reimburse 25% of qualified investments in facilities that start construction by the beginning of 2027. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the new credit will cost the Treasury about $24 billion through 2031.

Companies will have to compete for the act’s subsidies and the Commerce Department is currently working with the National Institute of Standards and Technology to fill in the details on that program.

The act does outline eligible uses of the funds which broadly include financing of U.S.-based facilities and equipment for “semiconductor fabrication assembly testing advanced packaging or research and development.” The funds can specifically be used to pay for “construction expansion or modernization” of such facilities and equipment associated workforce development efforts and certain operations costs including “specialized workforce essential materials and complex equipment maintenance.” The Commerce Department can also use a portion of the funds for loans and loan guarantees.

The subsidies come with some constraints including a requirement that companies cannot claim them if they expand their advanced manufacturing activities in “countries of concern” notably China. While China is arguing the provision is an unfair trade practice that aims to suppress its own efforts to develop its semiconductor sector the restriction builds on other recent U.S. efforts such as export controls to prevent rival nations from exploiting U.S.-funded technology.

In line with such aims the CHIPS and Science Act is also providing $500 million over five years to the State Department to support “development and adoption of secure and trusted telecommunications technologies secure semiconductors secure semiconductors supply chains and other emerging technologies.”

R&D initiatives

Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) and Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) met with representatives from the semiconductor industry and the University of Texas at an event in April to discuss a proposal to create a Texas Institute of Electronics. (Image credit – Office of Sen. Cornyn)

Much remains to be decided about how the act’s R&D initiatives will be structured.

The National Semiconductor Technology Center (NSTC) the Commerce Department is tasked with launching will be a public-private consortium that will conduct research and prototyping of advanced semiconductor technology support workforce-training programs and maintain an investment fund to help startup companies commercialize new technologies. NIST is also directed to establish a National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program (NAPMP) for developing new ways of encasing semiconductors within integrated circuits to expand in-house R&D relevant to microelectronics and to establish up to three Manufacturing USA institutes dedicated to microelectronics.

For fiscal year 2022 the act allocates $2 billion for NSTC $2.5 billion for NAPMP and $500 million for the remaining activities. These programs will receive an additional $6 billion total in the subsequent four years and the Commerce Department is granted discretion on how to split that money between them with no time limit on when it must be spent.

Lead sponsors of the CHIPS Act have been mobilizing coalitions to convince the department to locate the NSTC and NAPMP in their states. As early as last summer Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) was pitching the Albany NanoTech Complex to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo observing he had the region “front of mind” as he shepherded the funding through the Senate. Likewise Sens. John Cornyn (R-TX) and Mark Warner (D-VA) key architects of both CHIPS acts have led their states’ congressional delegations in urging Raimondo to consider establishing the programs in Texas and Virginia  respectively.

However the R&D activities will not necessarily be concentrated in a single location and stakeholders have offered various visions for the NSTC and other CHIPS Act programs. Earlier this year the Commerce Department received over 200 responses to a request for input on how to implement the new provisions. Among the respondents is the American Semiconductor Innovation Coalition a group of more than 50 companies universities and national laboratories that recommends the NSTC and NAPMP be driven by an industry-led network of “hubs and geographically distributed centers of excellence.”

The President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology also plans to weigh in on the act’s implementation in a forthcoming report led by council members Lisa Su who is the CEO of Advanced Micro Devices and Bill Dally the chief scientist at NVIDIA. Discussing their vision for the NSTC and NAPMP at a recent meeting  Su remarked “The definition of semiconductors is actually much broader than just people who make chips but includes system companies as well as equipment companies as well as the entire academic infrastructure. So we’re recommending a broad approach which would include a number of regional centers across the country that come together.”

That echoes sentiments expressed by Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger at a public meeting PCAST held in May to explore strategies for implementing the CHIPS Act.

Gelsinger estimated there is “probably 80% agreement on the outlines for the NSTC” but anticipated there will be “some vicious arguments on some fine points of governance structure.” He recommended that it take the form of a “set of nationwide hubs that are placed with U.S. companies and other facilities that leverage existing infrastructures” noting that Intel has offered to host a hub focused on advanced lithography and potentially a second on advanced packaging technology.

Attesting to NSTC’s importance Gelsinger observed that maintaining manufacturing capacity in the semiconductor sector is directly tied to ongoing R&D including at universities and startup companies. “When every new fab module is $10 billion and has to be backed up by many billions of dollars of R&D that is a yearly investment” he remarked. “On many of the more advanced technology requirements research efforts that’s where I see things like NSTC being so powerful [to] keep that R&D engine the talent engine the startup engine alive.”

Semiconductor Industry Association CEO John Neuffer also weighed in on the NSTC and NAPMP at the meeting arguing they should be industry-led leverage existing industrial facilities and focus on prototyping and piloting activities . He further argued the two programs should leverage existing industrial facilities and be “combined entirely” if possible and cautioned against a decentralized approach saying that “too much diffusion of resources risks leaving us with an anemic meandering result.”

PCAST previewed its report in a letter to President Biden the day he signed the CHIPS and Science Act stating it would be delivered within weeks. The letter notes it will suggest actions to promote workforce development and technology commercialization such as developing shared resources for startups and academic researchers to test new technologies reducing their development costs. It will also recommend the U.S. pursue “grand challenges” for semiconductor R&D such as construction of the first “zettascale” supercomputer which would be about 1000 times faster than the exascale supercomputers the U.S. is just now deploying .

The DOD-funded National Network for Microelectronics R&D the CHIPS Act created is tasked with transitioning R&D innovations into workable technologies. Among its other goals it is directed to “enable cost-effective exploration of new materials devices and architectures and prototyping in domestic facilities to safeguard domestic intellectual property.”

Former Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Director Victoria Coleman has been a champion of the network concept referring to it as a “microelectronics commons.” Explaining its motivation in an interview this year Coleman now the Air Force’s chief scientist said “The context was an understanding from really top-tier academics that investments that we were making in early-stage microelectronics research could not be proven in the facilities that we have here at home. We had to go instead off to overseas places in particular [Asia] to do the work that is necessary to prove out the innovation.”

How the DOD network will be structured and relate to the NSTC also remains to be seen. In its annual defense policy legislation last year Congress directed that it be led by at least two entities that together “represent the geographic diversity of the United States.” Lawmakers also expressed concern that DOD was unprepared to create the network and that there was still “confusion” among federal agencies about their respective roles in implementing CHIPS initiatives.

Workforce development

Semiconductor manufacturers have increasingly raised alarms about workforce shortages which are likely to be exacerbated as companies create thousands of jobs in response to the influx of CHIPS funding.

To help address the issue the CHIPS and Science Act provides $200 million over five years to the National Science Foundation for workforce development activities including creation of a National Network for Microelectronics Education. The network will support curriculum development shared training infrastructure public outreach and regional partnerships between associate- and bachelor-degree institutions labor groups and industry.

Industry players are calling for stronger action. For example the trade association SEMI and the American Semiconductor Academy have just released a report calling for the federal government to provide more than $2 billion over five years for workforce development activities including $500 million for the national education network. It notes a 2017 survey found that 82% of semiconductor companies reported difficulties finding qualified candidates and it states that workforce needs could more than double over the next few years because of the CHIPS Act.

The industry is also pushing for immigration reforms  particularly measures that would draw more workers with advanced degrees in STEM fields to the U.S. While many roles at chip fabs can be filled by technicians with two-year degrees from programs that can be set up at U.S. colleges the field will also require a large number of employees with graduate-level training that can be less rapidly scaled up.

The National Science Board reports that almost half of doctorate-level workers in science and engineering jobs in the U.S. are foreign-born but international students often face challenges securing visas to work in the U.S. after graduation.

In July a group of nine human resources executives at semiconductor companies sent a letter to Congress urging it to “enact much-needed green card reforms this year as part of any must-pass legislation.” They endorsed a provision proposed by House Democrats that would have exempted certain advanced degree graduates from the caps placed on green card supply. Negotiators removed that provision from the final CHIPS Act because it lacked sufficient support in the Senate. The lead Republican for immigration policy Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) has insisted any such changes must be implemented through a broad immigration policy bill.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZWhpZ2h2YWxsZXlsaXZlLmNvbS9iZXRobGVoZW0vMjAyMi8wOC9wYS1pbnZlc3RzLWluLWJldGhsZWhlbS1zdGFydHVwLXB1c2hpbmctYm91bmRhcmllcy1vZi1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kuaHRtbNIBlQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZWhpZ2h2YWxsZXlsaXZlLmNvbS9iZXRobGVoZW0vMjAyMi8wOC9wYS1pbnZlc3RzLWluLWJldGhsZWhlbS1zdGFydHVwLXB1c2hpbmctYm91bmRhcmllcy1vZi1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kuaHRtbD9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pa. invests in Bethlehem startup pushing boundaries of semiconductor technology,"Pennsylvania is investing nearly $1.74 million in a Bethlehem-based tech startup company that is pushing the boundaries of semiconductor efficiency.

“Semiconductors are the common element that allow these devices to function” Weaver said. “And when semiconductor production can’t keep up with demand it really affects us in so many different ways and in so many sectors of the economy because the products we rely on simply can’t get made quickly enough.”

“In short” he continued about iDEAL “they are breaking real ground on real new technology in the semiconductor industry through their super-efficient semiconductors that power in-demand industries like AI electric vehicles renewable energy data and so much more.”

A semiconductor is basically an on/off switch used in converting electricity from its raw form into power that electronics can use. The state of the technology is running around 60-70% efficiency with iDEAL working to boost that to 80-90% efficiency said David Jaurequi iDEAL’s chief technology officer and co-founder. That would have the effect of cutting greenhouse gases including in the energy-intensive cooling needed for computer processors.

iDEAL is a fabless company meaning its innovations and designs are communicated to foundries that produce semiconductor wafers said CEO and co-founder Mark Granahan. The company works exclusively with United States-based foundries in California Minnesota and New York to manufacture those wafers but will still rely on partners in Asia to package and assemble the components for electronics sub-assemblies and printed circuit boards that are needed around the world he said. More than 90% of advanced chips come from Taiwan which the new federal legislation seeks to address through domestic investment.

Granahan called combating that potential bottleneck in the supply chain through increased domestic production of semiconductors the elephant in the room and said the key along with investment in manufacturing is a focus on Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) in education.

“Every new technology from Amazon to Zillow relies on semiconductors” Granahan said. “Our health-care advances in imaging diagnostics therapeutics even pharmaceuticals is all driven by semiconductors. The nation’s advancements in wired and wireless data communications and telecommunication networks is carried by semiconductors.”

The Pennsylvania DCED is working with iDEAL to provide a $1.4 million Pennsylvania Industrial Development Authority loan and $338000 Pennsylvania First grant and is encouraging the company to apply for the department’s Manufacturing Tax Credit and Research and Development Tax Credit programs.

“Expansions like this help send a message to the greater business community that if any company is looking to expand or relocate Pennsylvania is the place to do it” Weaver said. “We have the talent the location the business climate the access like Ben Franklin Partners and the Governor’s Action Team to ensure that the business can grow and thrive here particularly in the tech and innovation sector.”

The Lehigh Valley’s history of semiconductor research and development dates to 1952 when Western Electric on Union Boulevard in Allentown developed the first-ever silicon germanium transistor semiconductor Granahan said ushering in a new age of electronics globally.

With access to imaging technology that can see atoms iDEAL today employs 12 PhD-credentialed employees and will be looking to fill a variety of jobs as it transitions into production and sales Granahan said. The company plans to find talent through social media and by working with human resources specialists and schools like Lehigh University and Penn State University he said.

“iDEAL Semiconductor is addressing a crucial need in national technology independence while creating and retaining highly paid sustainable technology jobs” stated Angelo J. Valletta president and CEO of the Ben Franklin Technology Partners of Northeastern Pennsylvania that runs TechVentures in Bethlehem. “We are delighted to have supported the firm from very early on with a financial investment and space in our TechVentures technology business incubator.”

Mark Warner.

Four local governments — including Chesterfield and Henrico counties — are pitching potential sites for large semiconductor chip factories to take advantage of a new federal law that dangles billions of dollars of incentives to return manufacturing of the critical microelectronic component to the United States.

Sen. Mark Warner D-Va. one of the principal authors of the CHIPS + Science Act that President Joe Biden signed into law on Aug. 9 convened a roundtable discussion in Richmond on Thursday to showcase sites that the state is marketing to attract big investments by manufacturers eager to take advantage of $40 billion in new federal subsidies for domestic production of semiconductor chips.

“I think Virginia is going to be very competitive” Warner said in an interview after the meeting and a tour of the Virginia Microelectronics Center at Virginia Commonwealth University. “But we have to realize that certain states at this point are a bit ahead.”

“We’re going to have to put up incentive packages that are frankly much larger than we have in the past” he said citing competition from states such as Ohio Texas Arizona and New York.

The 90-minute meeting included big county delegations led by Chesterfield County Administrator Joe Casey and Henrico County Manager John Vithoulkas as well as representatives for other potential semiconductor chip manufacturing sites in Pittsylvania County outside of Danville and Chesapeake in southeastern Virginia.

“We’re very much in the hunt for a large semiconductor facility” said Garrett Hart director of economic development in Chesterfield.

Chesterfield officials aren’t thinking small for a potential user of the 1200-acre site in the Upper Magnolia Green megasite on the western side of the county where an extension of the Powhite Parkway is planned. The site was a finalist for an investment by Intel Corp. that Hart said would have created a 400-acre manufacturing plant employing up to 20000 people.

The company based in Santa Clara Calif. instead chose a 1000-acre site near Columbus Ohio for a $20 billion investment in up to eight chip fabrication plants with the initial phase expected to employ 3000 Intel workers.

“If we can handle Intel that big we can handle anybody else” Hart said in an interview on Thursday.

Across the James River in eastern Henrico the White Oak Technology Park already has been home to a large semiconductor chip factory run by Qimonda until the company went bankrupt during the Great Recession. The former factory building is now owned by QTS providing shared space for data centers including one that serves more than 65 executive branch agencies of Virginia government.

The technology park also is home to data centers run by Meta Facebook’s parent company and has six additional sites for development including a combined 250-acre parcel along Elko Road near the intersection of Interstates 295 and 64.

“The site would accommodate a nice-sized fab” said Anthony Romanello executive director of the Henrico Economic Development Authority using shorthand for a chip fabrication facility. “We’ve had a semiconductor plant there so the infrastructure at White Oak already is supersized.”

Another contender is the Southern Virginia Megasite at Berry Hill with more than 3200 acres including about 1900 acres that the Virginia Economic Development Partnership identified as “shovel-ready publicly-owned developable land that can meet all required specs and timelines.”

The Berry Hill site a partnership between Pittsylvania and the city of Danville was a finalist for a $5.5 billion investment by Hyundai Corp. in adjacent factories for electric-vehicle assembly and EV battery manufacturing. In late April the South Korean company instead chose a megasite near Savannah Ga. for a project expected to employ more than 8000 people.

Sen. Frank Ruff R-Mecklenburg who chairs a legislative commission that reviews state incentives for economic development projects said the Berry Hill megasite “is the biggest in the state and probably one of the biggest ones on the East Coast.”

Not all of the rolling property is graded to be shovel ready but Ruff said “Anybody who is serious could start on the part that’s already ready to roll.”

The fourth site that the state economic development partnership is pitching is the Coastal Virginia Commerce Park more than 4000 acres of farmland east of the Great Dismal Swamp in Chesapeake along U.S. 17 a four-lane divided highway near the Port of Virginia in Hampton Roads.

One of its champions is Del. Barry Knight R-Virginia Beach chair of the House Appropriations Committee. He also is vice chair of the Major Employment and Investment Project Approval Commission which played a key role in shaping Virginia’s winning bid for Amazon’s $2.5 billion East Coast headquarters in Arlington County.

Knight said Chesapeake expects to rezone the property by late fall and then buy it from owner Frank T. Williams to develop the land as a megasite.

“It will probably take a year and a half or two years to get it shovel ready but we’re proceeding in that direction” he said in an interview on Thursday.

The challenge is how to attract companies that are looking to make major investments in semiconductor chip factories to take advantage of the federal subsidies available under the CHIPS law.

Jason El Koubi president and CEO of the economic development partnership said in a presentation on Thursday that the state is pitching a “robust labor pool and talent pipeline ready to support the industry’s historic staffing needs.”

Virginia already is home to Micron Technology Inc. one of the few companies still manufacturing semiconductor chips in the U.S. which account for just 12% of a global market dominated by South Korea Taiwan and China.

Micron based in Boise Idaho has produced semiconductors at the Manassas plant for almost 20 years employing about 1300 people. Four years ago it announced a $3 billion expansion aided by $70 million in state incentives to generate an additional 1100 jobs by 2030.

The company — represented at the meeting by Senior Vice President and General Counsel Rob Beard — recently raised expectations by announcing that it will invest $40 billion in production of semiconductor in the United States by the end of the decade because of the new federal incentives.

“Micron is finalizing its specific U.S. expansion plans and will share additional details in the coming weeks” the company said in a statement to the Richmond Times-Dispatch on Aug. 18. “There are multiple factors that inform our decision to invest billions of dollars to construct and operate a fab.”

“Regardless of the location of the new greenfield fab ongoing investments in existing fabs will be needed over time to upgrade them to produce the latest technologies” it added.

The CHIPS package also includes about $12 billion for research — potentially boosting work that is already under way at VCU.

“We are hopeful that today’s conversation and the law will spur additional federal investment in our nation’s scientific agencies like the National Science Foundation” said P. Srirama Rao vice president for research and innovation at VCU. “With a diversity of expertise among our faculty VCU is well-positioned to make Virginia the right place for such federal investment.”

Shiv N. Khanna chair and professor of physics at the university who is researching materials used to produce the chips said: “We are excited about the push to grow the semiconductor manufacturing industry in the U.S.

“Here at VCU we have scientists whose research could support the continuous innovation needed by the semiconductor industry.”

Warner said that money also will help develop a supply chain for the tools and equipment needed for chip production presenting economic opportunities of varying sizes for Virginia communities.

“Virginia has got more than 100 sites of more than 100 acres” he said. “This is not just about a couple of locations across the commonwealth.”

On August 9th President Biden signed the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act to boost U.S. investment in the semiconductor industry and incentivize domestic manufacturers. Some of its major provisions incentivize investment in the United States by major foreign chip manufacturers namely those from Taiwan and South Korea. Framed as a major legislative initiative to buttress U.S. technical prowess amid accelerating U.S.-China competition the CHIPS Act and the future of U.S.-ROK technological cooperation pose both challenges and opportunities for South Korea and its advanced semiconductor industry.

Over the last three decades U.S. semiconductor production has declined. The U.S. share of global semiconductor production used to be 37 percent. Today it is just over 12 percent. In contrast over the last five years China’s share of global production has grown from 3.8 to 9 percent. The global chip shortage during the pandemic and U.S.-China trade war have also highlighted the necessity of a strong domestic manufacturing base for semiconductors.

The legislation appropriates $52.7 billion in subsidies and tax credits to incentivize research and manufacturing in the United States. Furthermore the legislation will invest about $280 billion over the next decade in various organizations and offices for R&D. Firms hoping to capitalize on this major legislative initiative expressed interest well before President Biden’s signing of the bill with Ford Motor General Motors and GlobalFoundries meeting with U.S. government officials to discuss their plans for semiconductor investment.

If the CHIPS Act is a sign of renewed U.S. resolve in advancing its technological edge amid strategic competition with China it presents a new set of questions for South Korea’s government and industry. South Korean firms such as Samsung and SK Hynix are some of the most prolific semiconductor manufacturers of the world. As such Samsung was one of the “Big Three” chip manufacturers approached by the U.S. government in the years leading up to the CHIPS Act. Indeed President Biden’s first public meeting with South Korea’s President Yoon Suk-yeol in May 2022 was at a Samsung semiconductor plant. The joint presidential visit symbolically underscored the importance of the semiconductor industry for both countries and the Biden administration’s own sense of priority for this critical industry.

The legislation’s incentives for foreign investors could certainly make the United States more attractive as a destination for new semiconductor foundries (fabs). Samsung is expected to reap some benefits with an investment in a new plant in Taylor Texas. But a particular challenge for South Korean firms are their current fabs in China. Of the seven total fabs run by Samsung two are in China. The existing plants are no small matter: Samsung produces 40 percent of its NAND chips at its Xi’An plant. Not only could it take a herculean effort for Samsung to build such a capacity in the United States even with the CHIPS Act incentives which are capped at $3 billion per program but the legislation would prohibit Samsung from expanding its semiconductor manufacturing capabilities in China for 10 years. Therefore how Samsung will manage its operations in China in the face of the benefits and regulations posed by the CHIPS Act remains to be seen.

But the U.S. drive toward securing semiconductor supply chains and bringing technical infrastructure to the United States has much further implications not only for South Korea’s chip manufacturers but also for its government. The Biden administration has been pushing for South Korean membership in a prospective “Chip 4” alliance with Taiwan and Japan. As Seoul has traditionally been reluctant to antagonize Beijing as South Korea faces considerable pressure from China when considering its investments and alignments with the United States in the semiconductor field. Shortly before President Biden signed the CHIPS Act South Korea’s Foreign Minister Park Jin met with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Qingdao in the first meeting of its kind since President Yoon took office. The topic: South Korea’s place amid Sino-U.S. competition particularly with regards to semiconductors. Contrary to ostensible U.S. intentions with the CHIPS Act and related measures like Chip 4 Foreign Minister Park reassured Wang that South Korean meetings with the United States on semiconductor supply chains are “not meant to exclude or target any specific country.” U.S. commitment to its domestic chip production could strengthen the global supply chain for its allies assuaging South Korean concerns of retaliatory Chinese economic pressure. However South Korea’s ambiguous stance in Qingdao seems to indicate that Seoul may not yet be convinced.

The goals of the CHIPS Act along with its passage through both houses of Congress signal a significant whole-of-government and industry initiative to build out U.S. technical competitiveness. When coupled with diplomatic overtures like Chip 4 the measure is also the latest shot across the bow in the accelerating U.S.-China competition. Ultimately the CHIPS Act not only presents South Korea and its advanced semiconductor industry with new opportunities for cooperation with the United States but also adds to enduring questions for Seoul’s place between Washington and Beijing as advanced industrial states vie for preeminence in this critical industry.

With restaurants closed consumers hit grocery stores in droves to stock up on ingredients to prepare meals at home.

United States supermarket operator Albertsons Companies was among those that experienced a significant spike in business during the health crisis. In March and April of 2020 alone sales were up 34% compared to the previous year.

Greater demand meant Albertsons needed to expand its workforce and modernize its IT infrastructure. Fortunately a few years prior the company initiated a plan to move its highly customized on-premises human resource applications to the cloud. The move would give the $70 billion grocery giant a fast and cost-effective way to scale payroll for its nearly 300000 employees.

Founded in 1939 Albertsons is the second-largest grocery chain in North America with 2252 stores. The corporation operates multiple subsidiaries including Safeway Vons Tom Thumb Jewel Pavilions Shaw’s Star Market Haggen Andronico’s and ACME.

As competition in the U.S. grocery business grows and margins shrink stores are under increasing pressure to provide a stellar customer experience. That means they must be more agile and adaptable. Toward that end in 2019 Albertsons Companies launched a corporate mandate to move out of its corporate data centers and modernize its technology platform with a cloud-first strategy. As part of that plan Albertsons selected Oracle Fusion Cloud ERP and Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM which will provide platforms for continued modernization and productivity.

Albertsons’ enterprise transformation to Oracle Cloud HCM and ERP would take about 36 months and require several implementation waves. In the meantime the company sought an interim solution to move its legacy PeopleSoft Payroll application to the cloud quickly. Because the existing software was nearing end-of-life the company wanted to reduce the time it took to complete its weekly payroll runs while scaling the business as it continued to grow. Albertsons also needed to confidently adhere to a tight weekly payroll cycle for about 265000 employees.

After evaluating several options Albertsons decided the best path forward was to transition its existing PeopleSoft Payroll environment to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) including moving its Oracle database to Oracle Exadata Database Service.

“The PeopleSoft expertise Oracle has and the benefits and support we would receive from the Oracle Advanced Customer Services team to help us migrate PeopleSoft to OCI was a large factor in our decision” says Albertsons Solutions Architect Sambuddha Ghosh.

A unique virtual cloud network topology

To make its plan viable Albertsons’ PeopleSoft Payroll application was moved to a unique multiple virtual cloud network (VCN) topology on OCI managed by the Oracle Advanced Customer Services team.

“Working with the Oracle Advanced Customer Services team has been awesome” says Ghosh. “Oracle helped us understand how we could successfully migrate everything that was either end of life or close to end of life. We came up with a timeline for the migration and the team provided us with updates every step of the way which helped us plan the project effectively.”

Here’s how the new configuration works:

As the figure above illustrates Albertsons has five VCNs. One (VCN00) is a transit VCN for external users who can access Albertsons network on OCI from the internet and through a Web Application Firewall (WAF). From there external users are sent to an Oracle public Load Balancer. Once inside the grocer’s public subnet external users are routed to a WebLogic/ForgeRock Identity Gateway which validates their single sign-on (SSO) and authorizes their access policies in an Azure Active Directory. This external transit VCN is peered to a second VCN (VCN02) for production both of which are located in Oracle’s San Jose California cloud region. This production VCN is then peered to a third VCN located in a disaster recovery and non-production cloud region in Ashburn Virginia.

In a fourth VCN (VCN01) Albertsons internal users also connect from a site-to-site VPN but are then moved to a private load balancer. From Albertsons’ private subnet internal users are routed to the WebLogic/ForgeRock Identity Gateway which validates their SSO and authorizes their access policies in an Azure Active Directory. This transit VCN is also peered to the production VCN in San Jose which is then peered to the disaster recovery and non-production environment in Ashburn.

The fifth VCN (VCN04) is also a transit VCN and is used by OMCS personnel. These users actively manage and support the company’s OCI tenancy and access the VCN through a site-to-site VPN before passing through a dynamic routing gateway.

In Albertsons’ production environment PeopleSoft Payroll applications run on eight virtual machines and all the payroll data is stored in an Oracle Database 19c which runs on a quarter-rack Exadata Database Service supporting two node Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC) to maximize availability while accessing shared storage. In the secondary region in Ashburn two additional Exadata Database Service quarter racks support both non-production and disaster recovery environments. Oracle Data Guard replicates the database and the non-database components to disaster recovery (DR). The DR environment is deployed with the identical configuration as production with one exception: The DR database is located on one of the Exadata Database Service servers but shares this database with a collection of non-production environments. Albertsons chose Oracle Enterprise Database Service to support its third-party software applications with these databases running on virtual machines.

Improving speed and flexibility

Since moving PeopleSoft to OCI in May 2021 Albertsons produces its weekly payroll 50% faster than when it ran those jobs on-premises.

“Because we run payroll weekly it’s critical to make sure all the different divisions and groups are paid within a proper timeframe” says Ghosh. “The Exadata migration helped us immensely on that front. We have seen a huge gain in performance and the overall time it takes to run payroll has improved significantly.”

In addition to improving the efficiency and core horsepower of its payroll processes Albertsons can now scale OCI at predetermined times. When its non-production environments aren’t in high demand they can be quickly powered down. When those resources are needed again they quickly scale back up. This process allows Albertsons to optimize its OCI consumption and control costs.

Ultimately moving its on-premises PeopleSoft Payroll workload to OCI provides Albertsons better flexibility so it can adapt quickly to sudden growth or other changes in the future. It also allows the company to focus on its longer-term migrations to Oracle Cloud HCM and ERP providing a clear transition path to align with its new corporate cloud strategy. But perhaps mostly critically the migration allows Albertsons to modernize its entire IT infrastructure without creating any disruptions in its payroll operations.

Tom Orel (pictured) is at risk of losing his $5million luxury mansion after his company Oracle Homes went under

The managing director of a collapsed building giant is at risk of losing his $5million luxury mansion - with furious creditors setting their sights on the waterfront palace.

Oracle Building Corporation Pty Ltd - also known as Oracle Hunter Homes and Oracle Platinum Homes - was wound up at a general meeting on Wednesday leaving up to 300 half-built properties across Queensland and NSW.

At least one creditor the company's boss Tom Orel owes money to has since laid a legal claim on his six-bedroom home on the Gold Coast.

Property records seen by Daily Mail Australia show a concreting firm lodged a caveat against Mr Orel's sprawling two-storey property.

That means the home - which features a cinema and private lap pool - cannot be sold by the owner in the event of the business going bust.

The property is listed in the name of Mr Orel's wife Elia who is also an Oracle director.

But the Orels still have the property to return to while hundreds of families can only despair at their dreams of building a new house - after the builder spectacularly went under.

The Orels still have this property to return to while hundreds of families can only despair at their dreams of building a new house

It is the latest in a wave of devastating collapses in the building industry which is seeing firms go under across Australia sunk by high costs and supply constraints.

Creditors and suppliers are lining up to get what money they can from Oracle after an insolvency notice was published with the corporate regulator ASIC.

Liquidators Bill Cotter and Roland Robson of Robson Cotter Insolvency Group said the company owed about $15million.

Oracle owes money to about 200 suppliers and contractors and 70 staff have lost their jobs with some owed money for accrued leave.

Meanwhile the Orel family home - a 1122-square metre property - looks out on Nerang River in the canal-laced suburb of Benowa Waters - with a previous real estate listing gushing about accommodation that many customers would have liked to have had as they waited months or years to see progress on their homes.

The home theatre features scarlet red leather couches with an old real estate ad boasting that it offers 'an authentic experience in gold class surroundings'

The home has five 'designer' bathrooms plus a powder room home theatre large office playroom or gym a pool BBQ area sun deck and an area that is labelled as an 'upstairs teenage retreat'.

The master bedroom has two walk-in wardrobes with a spa bath-equipped ensuite. Four other 'super spacious' bedrooms also come with ensuites.

The house's 'extra high ceilings and scenic window walls ... create an ambiance of endless space' according to the listing - and it also includes a sun deck area with a private lap pool with pontoon boat mooring.

But as the Orel family was living the dream the company's customers were asked to cough up tens of thousands of dollars - on top of their original bill - to have their homes completed as the business went under.

In a letter to one homeowner obtained by the Courier Mail Mr Orel requested an additional $50000 to finish the build on top of the contract price.

The large kitchen area comes with a large breakfast bar appliances and a 'butler's pantry'

The director explained the increase was due to 'ongoing ripple effects' from the pandemic which had caused a price surge and supply issues.

Ian Smith whose son's Oracle home is being built near Ipswich in Queensland's south-east was forced to threaten legal action against the company.

He said Oracle had demanded another $50000 to complete the home which at that point was receiving the finishing touches.

Having experience in the construction industry he fought back and said revisions to the agreed upon price contract were not enforceable.

The master bedroom in the house comes with two walk-in wardrobes and a spa bath equipped ensuite

Mr Smith said Oracle still refused to hand over the property until he threatened legal action but admitted other customers 'are just paying up'.

'There are other people in the same boat' he said.

'Young people working class people are receiving these demands and it is stressing them out due to the time blowout as well as increased living and legal costs.'

Would-be homeowners flooded social media to express their anger and devastation as the company collapsed.

'We just lost our deposit' one customer claimed ... 'Oracle Platinum Homes has gone into liquidation.'

Another said they had 'just lost $25k'.

'Glad we are getting out which has caused more stress. I wish we'd never started this process at all. Now we have land and no builder.'

Another said: 'My granddaughter's house is now two years and still only a slab and half a frame. Absolutely atrocious.'

A statement from Oracle's liquidators said Mr Orel was fully cooperating with the process.

'Mr Orel has highlighted the well known difficult circumstances prevailing in the construction industry including the recent and rapid rise in costs of construction materials eroding the Company's margins and substantial delays experienced in securing supply of materials and labour as all contributing to the Company's position' a spokesperson said.

'These factors resulted in cost over runs and delays in project completions which severely impacted the Company's cash flows and it's capacity to continue to operate despite the owners and staff of the Company's best endeavours.'

Building giant collapses leaving hundreds of families with unfinished homes in the lurch as devastated homeowner reveals how she poured $211000 into a dream house which may NEVER be built

Montana and her partner Troy (pictured) are just two of the many homeowners affected by the building company's collapse

Devastated homeowners are reeling as yet another Australian building company collapses leaving distressed customers facing huge bills to get their unfinished properties completed.

Oracle Building Corporation Pty Ltd - also known as Oracle Hunter Homes and Oracle Platinum Homes - was wound up at a general meeting on Wednesday leaving up to 300 properties under construction in Queensland and NSW.

Montana Wilkinson and her husband are just two of the homeowners left in the lurch by the company's sudden closure having already forked out $211000 for their unfinished home.

Their home in Ipswich Queensland is one of 300 incomplete properties left behind by Oracle with 70 staff losing their jobs and 200 suppliers owed money.

The company's websites have been taken down - featuring only a message saying 'account suspended' - as customers vented their distress and frustration online.

'They [Oracle] just dragged down everyone's lives' homeowner Ms Wilkinson told news.com.au.

She explained while she had been warned about delays to her $304000 home near Ipswich it was when the company asked for a further $70000 that she became suspicious about what was going on with the build.

Her mother Boz Thurtell even works at the collapsed builder and sold her daughter the home - leaving her in tears when she got a call at 9am on Wednesday to tell her she no longer had a job.

'It's heartbreaking it's terribly wrong' she added.

On August 9 Brisbane-based Besse Construction collapsed owing $1.7million and leaving 30 people out of work.

Solido Builders Pty Ltd went into liquidation in May and Pivotal Homes Pty Ltd in June.

Victorian firms Wulfrun Constructions Pty Ltd went into liquidation in July.

Another Victorian builder Waterford Homes went bust a week earlier owing at least $600000 to 60 creditors.

The failed companies joined a string of builders who have faltered this year.

Construction giant Pro-build went under in March owing more than $14million to 784 workers while Gold Coast-based Condev appointed liquidators weeks later leaving creditors out of pocket $31million.

Meanwhile several other firms have spent the past few months teetering on the brink of collapse as economic issues wreak havoc on the industry.

Surfers Paradise builder Pivotal Homes one of Queensland's biggest home builders went into liquidation in May. Pictured is a stock image of a man painting the side of a house

Melbourne-based construction giant Metricon - one of the nation's largest companies - last month sparked rumours it was trouble after holding crisis talks with clients and meeting with the Victoria Treasurer.

The owners injected $30million into the embattled company although bosses have denied it is at risk of entering liquidation.

Michaela Lihou from the Masters Builders Association of Victoria explained the crisis impacting construction in Australia.

'We have got supply shortages skills shortages and at the moment it's a perfect storm' she said.

Matthew Mackey executive director of engineering company Arcadis said smaller businesses are more likely to go broke because they can't absorb the cost increases like their larger counterparts.

'Smaller businesses don't have the cash flow they don't have the same safety net' he explained.

Gerald Venzl senior director product management at Oracle Corporation speaks with Abbinaya Kuzhanthaivel about the risks of following the hype and shares his thoughts on how to grow a career by contributing to open source projects.

Q. Can you tell us a bit about your journey with open source?

A. I currently work as a database product manager looking after the Oracle Database. As part of my job I help steer the direction of the product and help pinpoint priorities in the market that need to be addressed. Often people are surprised when I tell them that open source is an important aspect of that. For example Oracle recently launched a Kubernetes operator for its database which is fully open source and is available on GitHub. But we have also Docker build files on GitHub and even some of our Oracle Database drivers are fully open source such as our Node.js driver and the Python driver.

Q. Is Oracle your first venture into open source?

A. I was accustomed to open source in my personal life before joining Oracle. For me open source is a natural part of my job.

Oracle has a long-standing commitment to open source with Oracle Linux Java MySQL and many other projects. Although the Oracle Database core is proprietary we see the value of open source and having people to contribute and understand the technologies around it.

Q. What do you think about open source as an opportunity?

A. The thing that I like about open source is that it’s essentially a democracy and everybody gets to participate. Not that all participants are core contributors but it connects people from all over the world. The exposure to projects and other developers is important for growing your skillset and your career.

In Oracle we are currently focusing a lot on the Kubernetes operator. That’s an exciting project. In my free time I also write little tools and open source them. I had worked a little on a command line tool called ‘csv2db’ that allows you to load CSV data into a database. I see these projects as a chance to educate myself. You read something and then you try to implement it and see whether you really understood it whether it works and so on.

Q. How did this change happen from being a developer to a product manager?

A. My path was probably highly irregular. I am from Austria originally where I worked as a developer for an American company headquartered in New York. I was part of the performance engineering team. I was actually one of those guys who tried to profile the code and those skills eventually brought me to troubleshoot production systems at customer sites. I relocated to New York and then a couple of years later Oracle asked me to join their pre-sales team as a result of our earlier interactions in running proof-of-concepts and performance tests on their systems together.

I liked the opportunity to learn by interacting with customers directly and discussing requirements. But for me the turning point was moving back into development and specifically into the technical aspects as product manager.

Q. What are the top two ‘must have’ qualities of your role?

A. I think one must definitely be able to accept ever-changing requirements. But it’s not just a reactive job. You also have to have a curious mindset. If you have a curious mind are open to new ideas and can think out-of-the-box you can establish your priorities and grow into the role.

Q. What would you like to say about the challenges in your current role?

A. Product manager is a very diverse and ever-changing role. One must be highly adaptive because you need to go through steering the product prioritising the internal roadmap and also accept changes depending on market demands and customer needs. So the key challenge and also the fun part is that no day really ever looks the same.

Q. Any important risk you have taken so far which you think might inspire others?

A. I think my shifting into product management was the biggest risk. The future is unpredictable and one must dare to take such risks. For open source projects it’s probably taking the step and actually wanting to contribute to a project. It can be a bit daunting in the beginning especially to know where to start contributing for very popular active projects. Not all contributions have to be done in code; often people appreciate help with the documentation or testing. There are many ways to get started — the important thing is that you do get started. If you are passionate about something you will have to go after it. You may have people not reacting the way you expect at first but that’s okay. It will essentially help to learn.

Q. What do you consider as top leadership qualities?

A. There are a couple of things that I think are important for leadership. And the first one is that it’s okay to be wrong and acknowledge it. This also encourages people around you to freely share ideas. The other thing would be to take chances and get out of your comfort zone. I have never formally learnt product management. I just was intrigued by it gave it a try and I thought let’s see how it goes. It has put me in a good space for growth.

Q. Anything you are not very happy about when it comes to open source?

A. I wish the industry would not follow this ever increasing hype cycle for new stuff. New doesn’t automatically mean great. We may talk just about all the new things out there but the world still runs on Linux and remember we still use the HTTP TCP/IP and all those technologies today. The fundamental technologies that connect us around the globe have been there for a long time. Something doesn’t have to be new to be great and often new technologies go just as fast as they came.

Q. What are the major risks in going ahead with new technologies?

A. A major risk is forgetting or not wanting to ask the “why” we need the new technology. In our industry we get excited very quickly about something that we then want to work with. Sometimes that means that we oversimplify some business requirements and kind of omit the downsides of a new technology just so that we can use it for a new project. I agree that new things lead to innovations and there is nothing wrong with that. But I have equally seen just as many projects fail that tried to replace the legacy system because a new buzz technology is out there and looks attractive. I’ve seen a three or four year-long project fail because no one bothered to look at the ‘why’ when replacing the previous system; and although it solved the new requirements people forgot to ask themselves what the old system did well and they just ended up with those old issues again.

Q. How does one keep away from the hype around new technologies?

A. I would say that as a developer don’t just blindly follow the latest and greatest. If someone is telling you new stuff well it’s great to know. But it’s no surprise to me that Linux runs the world and HTTP runs the Web because those technologies are really well-designed. Have an open mind and look at what’s new but think about whether this new technology actually will serve your needs. It’s fine if it doesn’t.

Q. How can a developer find projects to contribute to while keeping away from the hype?

A. There’s nothing wrong with working on a hype project but you have to make sure that you actually have interest. Think small — don’t expect to become the main contributor in the next two weeks or in a short span.

Remember most of the open source projects really like non-code contributions just as much such as testing or reporting bugs or lack of information in the documentation. Don’t just go into it to write some code. Initially have some idea about which area you want to contribute to. It should be something that excites you. Go to GitHub and just read through project contributing guidelines. It will tell you what contributions the project needs and how to make them correctly.

Your work may be small like adding a sentence to the doc or correcting a typo. But it will allow you to get familiar with the process and with the other people involved in these projects. Do not expect to jump into a project and change its core. Most likely only an approved committee of committers can actually change that part of the code. Build some trust show that you understand the project and over time your involvement will grow naturally.

Q. Any examples of projects you think were overrated because they had just used a new technology?

A. I have seen a few working in the database space. When you think about it relational databases have been around for a very long time and are still going strong. To some extent we have forgotten why relational databases became so popular. The goal was to organise the data in a way so that five years from now somebody who comes in and has no clue what the data looked like can make sense out of it. For a while there was a general hype that you no longer need any database whether relational or non-relational because Hadoop will do everything. And it didn’t. It actually just led to data cleansing issues for many folks. Don’t get me wrong — there are companies that successfully run Hadoop clusters and there is nothing bad about the technology itself. But you have to understand what it is and when to use it.

Q. Oracle has recently introduced the new MongoDB API for its autonomous database. What was the reason behind it and how did it happen?

A. At Oracle we follow the converged database methodology. This methodology focuses on bringing the algorithms and computation to the data rather than the other way around. A very good analogy for converged database methodology is the smartphone where you can do multiple use cases in one device like taking a picture and sending it to a friend while being on a phone call for example. In recent years we have seen a proliferation of vendors pitching their technology to address an often simple use case For example developers like working with JSON documents and MongoDB allows them to store and retrieve these documents. But it is one thing to store and retrieve these and another to analyse terabytes of them in real-time. We think SQL is a really good language for any kind of analytics and we have the best database for mixed workloads i.e. allow real-time analytics while transactional workloads are running. Additionally Oracle Database has been managing JSON documents natively since 2014.

Developers love the MongoDB API as it makes database interaction very natural for them. And we have the best database for analytics and mixed workloads that can also manage JSON documents natively. So we decided to give developers the best of both worlds — the same MongoDB API on top of the world’s leading database.

Q. Will you say MongoDB is a new hype?

A. The JSON format is a very useful hierarchical format and is nothing new — it’s been around since 2001. If you want to use JSON then go ahead by all means. Oracle has done a lot of work to introduce JSON operations into the SQL standard and we see more and more databases supporting these standardised operations. You will find that if you want to work with JSON retrieve JSON documents query and manipulate data in JSON documents you definitely don’t need to have a document store anymore. MongoDB is a cool technology but so were XML databases in their days. I think it is definitely not needed for data management aspects.

Q. Any hiring plans?

A. We are constantly hiring great talent and all our openings can be accessed on the Oracle careers page. We are looking for people in a variety of different roles including engineering and product management. We are strong in diversity and have people from all around the world and all ages including graduate students.

Q. Your message for our readers.

A. Programming is a universal language and it’s great to be a developer and write programs. Don’t be shy be always ready to try something new and get out of your comfort zone to do things you are passionate about.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc25ld3NhdXN0cmFsaWEuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL3Ryb3VibGUtYnJld2luZy1mb3Itc29tZS10aW1lLWF0LW9yYWNsZS1idWlsZGluZy1jb3JwLWFoZWFkLW9mLS0xNG0tY29sbGFwc2UuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Oracle Building Corp in $14m collapse,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.businessnewsaustralia.com/articles/trouble-brewing-for-some-time-at-oracle-building-corp-ahead-of--14m-collapse.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc25ld3NhdXN0cmFsaWEuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL3Ryb3VibGUtYnJld2luZy1mb3Itc29tZS10aW1lLWF0LW9yYWNsZS1idWlsZGluZy1jb3JwLWFoZWFkLW9mLS0xNG0tY29sbGFwc2UuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

With the grand opening of the E. James and Eileen P. Ferland Engineering Education and Design Center (Ferland EEDC) at the University of Maine a new chapter begins in engineering education to better meet the needs of students and employers including the innovation to advance research and economic development.

Upward of 500 people from throughout the state attended the grand opening ceremony for Ferland EEDC on Aug. 24. The late-morning program was followed by a ribbon-cutting and an open house with students and faculty greeting guests on the three floors of the $78 million facility — the largest project of its kind in UMaine history made possible with the support from more than 500 donors and a $50 million investment from the state of Maine.

A recording of the event livestream is online.

Ferland EEDC is home to the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Biomedical Engineering Program and includes teaching laboratories for the Mechanical Engineering Technology Program.

The Student Project Design Suite is the best of its kind in the Northeast with 44 workbenches that will be assigned to students; and shops for biomedical engineering electronics 3D printing vehicles metals wood and composites. The building also houses the Campus Welcome and STEM Outreach Center which will be the starting point for campus tours and five collaborative classrooms that will serve the entire campus.

The facility will have the capacity to increase engineering enrollment by a third — 600 additional students a year — to meet the demand of students and employers in the state.

Approval of $50 million in public investment over 10 years by the Maine Legislature and then-Gov. Paul LePage in 2017 helped to catalyze the campaign. Since then a record $25 million in private support was raised from more than 500 alumni friends foundations and corporate donors for this capital priority of UMaine’s $200 million Vision for Tomorrow comprehensive campaign led by the University of Maine Foundation.

In the years since subsequent state Legislatures and Gov. Janet Mills have sustained this support and in May appropriated additional debt service that will help modernize other engineering and related facilities at UMaine and across the University of Maine System to advance a goal to double the output of engineers and computing and information science professionals to meet the demands of Maine employers for world-class talent and innovation.

Construction of the 115000-square-foot facility began in May 2020. A virtual groundbreaking was held in April 2020; a virtual topping off ceremony was held in February 2021.

WBRC Architects Engineers based in Bangor and Ellenzweig of Boston designed Ferland EEDC; Consigli Construction of Milford Massachusetts and Portland Maine led its construction.

Over the two years of the design and two years of the construction of Ferland EEDC more than 70 UMaine alumni are estimated to have worked on the project.

“This state-of-the-art center at our R1 university will allow us to produce more engineering and computing and information science professionals that Maine needs to grow its economy and be competitive in the world” said UMaine President Joan Ferrini-Mundy. “This facility is a tribute to the forward thinking and leadership of three Legislatures and two Governors on behalf of the people of Maine and stakeholders who know the value of a UMaine education and hands-on research learning and the difference it makes in the success of its students alumni and the state.”

This is an exciting pivotal time for engineering education in — and for — Maine said UMaine College of Engineering Dean Dana Humphrey. “The Ferland Engineering Education and Design Center is a capital investment in the future of engineering education that will impact Maine and beyond made possible by the vision and leadership of hundreds of donors and corporate partners who know the difference that this facility will make in workforce and economic development. Coupled with the transformational investment in the Maine College of Engineering Computing and Information Science by the Harold Alfond Foundation we are positioned to provide the critical industries communities and employers with the skilled workers and innovation needed to meet demand and move Maine forward.”

The building’s $10 million naming gift the largest capital gift in UMaine history came from Skowhegan natives E. James “Jim” Ferland ’64 and Eileen P. Ferland.

Five additional major naming gifts to the project came from the Abbagadassett Foundation; Gustavus and Louise Pfeiffer Research Foundation; Harold Alfond Foundation; Packaging Corporation of America; and Pratt & Whitney.

“We’d like to acknowledge Dean Dana Humphrey’s leadership as well as the dedicated design and construction team” said the Ferlands. “It’s an honor to have the Ferland Engineering Education and Design Center bear our family name. It’s what we expected — a place that will inspire and prepare the next generation of UMaine engineers.”

The Ferland’s gift in 2018 was an important catalyst for the center funding said University of Maine Foundation President Jeff Mills.

“Their generosity and vision inspired others which led us to the finish line for completing this state-of-the-art center” Jeff Mills said.

PANW,Palo Alto Networks,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhcmtyZWFkaW5nLmNvbS92dWxuZXJhYmlsaXRpZXMtdGhyZWF0cy9jaXNhLXBhbG8tYWx0by1maXJld2FsbC1idWctYWN0aXZlLWV4cGxvaXTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CISA: Just-Disclosed Palo Alto Networks Firewall Bug Under Active Exploit,"The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is warning that a high-severity security vulnerability in Palo Alto Networks firewalls is being actively exploited in the wild.

The bug (CVE-2022-0028 CVSS severity score of 8.6) exists in the PAN-OS operating system that runs the firewalls and could allow a remote threat actor to abuse them to deploy distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against targets of their choice — without having to authenticate.

Two weeks since its disclosure CISA said that it has now seen the bug being adopted by cyber adversaries in the wild and it's added it to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalogue. Attackers can exploit the flaw to deploy both reflected and amplified versions of DDoS floods.

Exploitation of the issue can help attackers to cover their tracks and location according to the original Palo Alto Networks advisory issued earlier this month.

""The DoS attack would appear to originate from a Palo Alto Networks PA-Series (hardware) VM-Series (virtual) and CN-Series (container) firewall against an attacker-specified target"" according to the firm.

""The good news is that this vulnerability does not provide attackers with access to the victim's internal network"" says Phil Neray vice president of cyber-defense strategy at CardinalOps. ""The bad news is that it can halt business-critical operations [at other targets] such as taking orders and handling customer service requests.""

He notes that DDoS attacks aren't just mounted by small-time nuisance actors as is often assumed: ""DDoS has been used in the past by adversary groups like APT28 against the World Anti-Doping Agency.""

The bug arises thanks to a URL-filtering policy misconfiguration so instances that use a non-standard configuration are at risk. To be exploited the firewall configuration ""must have a URL filtering profile with one or more blocked categories assigned to a security rule with a source zone that has an external facing network interface"" the advisory read.

Exploited in the Wild

Bud Broomhead CEO at Viakoo says bugs that can be marshaled into service to support DDoS attacks are in more and more demand by cybercriminals -- and are increasingly exploited.



""The ability to use a Palo Alto Networks firewall to perform reflected and amplified attacks is part of an overall trend to use amplification to create massive DDoS attacks"" he says. ""Google's recent announcement of an attack which peaked at 46 million requests per second and other record-breaking DDoS attacks will put more focus on systems that can be exploited to enable that level of amplification.""

The speed of weaponization also fits the trend of cyberattackers taking increasingly less time to put newly disclosed vulnerabilities to work — but this also points to an increased interest in lesser-severity bugs on the part of threat actors.

""Too often our researchers see organizations move to patch the highest-severity vulnerabilities first based on the CVSS"" Terry Olaes director of sales engineering at Skybox Security wrote in an emailed statement. ""Cybercriminals know this is how many companies handle their cybersecurity so they've learned to take advantage of vulnerabilities seen as less critical to carry out their attacks.""

But patch prioritization continues to be a challenge for organizations of all stripes and sizes thanks to the sheer number of patches that are disclosed in a given month — it totals hundreds of vulnerabilities that IT teams need to triage and assess often without much guidance to go on. And furthermore Skybox Research Lab recently found that new vulnerabilities that went on to be exploited in the wild rose by 24% in 2022.

That said ""any vulnerability that CISA warns you about if you have in your environment you need to patch now"" Roger Grimes data-driven defense evangelist at KnowBe4 tells Dark Reading. ""The [KEV] lists all the vulnerabilities that were used by any real-world attacker to attack any real-world target. Great service.""

He notes that the list is exhaustive: ""It isn't just full of Windows or Google Chrome exploits. I think the average computer security person would be surprised about what's on the list. It's full of devices firmware patches VPNs DVRs and a ton of stuff that isn't traditionally thought of as being highly targeted by hackers.""

Time to Patch & Monitor for Compromise

For the newly exploited PAN-OS bug patches are available in the following versions:

PAN-OS 8.1.23-h1

PAN-OS 9.0.16-h3

PAN-OS 9.1.14-h4

PAN-OS 10.0.11-h1

PAN-OS 10.1.6-h6

PAN-OS 10.2.2-h2

And all later PAN-OS versions for PA-Series VM-Series and CN-Series firewalls.

To determine if the damage is already done ""organizations should ensure they have solutions in place capable of quantifying the business impact of cyber-risks into economic impact"" Olaes wrote.

He added ""This will also help them identify and prioritize the most critical threats based on the size of financial impact among other risk analyses such as exposure-based risk scores. They must also enhance the maturity of their vulnerability management programs to ensure they can quickly discover whether or not a vulnerability impacts them and how urgent it is to remediate.""

Grimes notes that it's a good idea to subscribe to CISA's KEV emails as well.

""If you subscribe you'll get at least an email a week if not more telling what the latest exploited vulnerabilities are"" he says. ""It isn't just a Palo Alto Networks problem. Not by any stretch of the imagination.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZm9ybWF0aW9ud2Vlay5jb20vaXQtbGVhZGVyc2hpcC9ob3ctdG8taW1wbGVtZW50LWFpb3BzLWZvci1zZC13YW4taW4teW91ci1uZXR3b3Jr0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Implement AIOps for SD-WAN in Your Network,"Software-defined WAN (SD-WAN) continues to be a game changer in any organization’s digital transformation journey. SD-WAN’s ability to intelligently steer application traffic enforce service level agreements (SLAs) and provide granular visibility has made it a de facto solution to deliver branch transformation cloud adoption and support for the hybrid workforce. Although legacy SD-WAN manages to automate some day 0 operations with zero-touch provisioning and centralized configuration it still requires significant human intervention to identify troubleshoot and resolve issues resulting in operational complexity and costs.

Evolution of AIOps for SD-WAN

In some ways legacy SD-WAN has managed to hide underlying network problems by addressing performance issues with its rudimentary techniques like failover and redundancy. As a result infrastructure teams continue to react to a critical outage rather than proactively identifying anomalies and resolving them. To overcome these challenges organizations are ramping up using artificial intelligence for operations (AIOps) capabilities to reduce operational complexity and costs. Gartner recognizes this trend by stating “By 2025 40% of enterprises with SD-WAN deployments will use artificial intelligence (AI) functions to automate Day 2 operations compared with fewer than 5% in 2021.""

AIOps effectively curates large operational data gathered using SD-WAN analytics to correlate events provide deep WAN insights and auto remediate issues that simplify operations. However some organizations are taking a cautious approach to implementing AIOps due to the challenges in measuring its values and realizing their benefits. AIOps adoption is expanding but infrastructure leaders are looking for a strategic approach that ensures tangible business outcomes.

Changing the Mindset

Infrastructure leaders should understand that the right approach to implementing AIOps for SD-WAN will deliver the following benefits:

Improve observability by auto monitoring the network and proactively identifying critical events so IT teams become aware of the problems immediately and act quickly. AI and machine learning (ML) is used to correlate thousands of events and data to provide meaningful insights into network and application performance issues. Innovative deep neural network models and Seq2Seq ML models help with forecasting and anomaly detection otherwise difficult for humans to identify.

Provide interpretable assessments with pattern discovery that identifies root cause analysis for network and application performance issues along with recommendations to resolve them proactively.

Deliver proactive remediation by leveraging topological change data business policy configuration and access controls to auto remediate with the most relevant solutions from multiple possibilities that may exist.

Focus on Business Outcomes

SD-WAN solutions have expanded visibility into performance user experience network connectivity and business continuity leading to an explosion in data. It does not make sense to constantly depend on human interventions to gain insights by combing through thousands of data points or events that have led to the rapid adoption of AIOps. At the same time there are concerns about the accuracy of AI systems outputs as most of these derivations are hidden. Infrastructure leaders should implement an incremental approach that allows them to leverage AIOps and interpret insights to provide root cause analysis that leads to a conclusion by these systems. They should consider the following steps to reliably implement AIOps for SD-WAN including:

Discover critical network/topology changes by tracking branch infrastructure products applications and users to build a topological representation of the network and identify critical changes that negatively impact performance and alert users. Use ML based baselines and identify anomalies.



Leverage deep insights with predictive analytics by processing large volumes of data and events to identify incidents and proactively predict issues that enable IT staff to resolve issues proactively.



Use guided recommendations for faster resolution by continually learning and refining insights to provide step-by-step guidance to administrators to resolve issues and provide confirmation that the problem has been resolved.



Allow auto-remediation by tuning application SLAs and business policies with proven assessments of incidents and responses to trigger an issue fixation automatically.

Understand the AIOps Building Blocks for SD-WAN

An effective AIOps for SD-WAN leverages meaningful data to provide explainable and interpretable outcomes. Understanding how and what data is ingested by AIOps and the techniques implemented to analyze such data to produce actionable outcomes is essential. Here are some of the building blocks that ensure the right approach to implementing AIOps for SD-WAN:





Data Lake - Collected in real-time and historical AIOps should be capable of analyzing large volumes of data collected across multiple sources including applications networks and users. This data is then cleansed correlated optimized and tracked required for deeper and meaningful insights.



Deep Neural network and Machine Learning - Implement pattern recognition and prediction with DNNs supervised and unsupervised machine learning models to enable baselining anomaly detection root cause analysis and network topology discovery to provide predictive analytics guided and automated remediation.



Centralized Dashboard - AIOps-enabled insights and analytics should be easily consumed by the IT staff from a centralized console that provides SD-WAN analytics.

In their second year of helping protect the infosec event's Network Operations Center (NOC) IronNet's team said it flagged 31 malicious alerts and 45 highly suspicious events according to the team's postmortem report.

Of course not all of the malware detected at Black Hat is intended to infect devices and perform nefarious acts — some of it stems from simulated attacks in classrooms and on the show floor. So while Tor activity and DNS tunneling likely would and should raise alarms in an enterprise network at the cybersecurity conference they turned out to be regular attendee behavior and vendor demos.

However the security firm's hunters – Peter Rydzynski Austin Tippett Blake Cahen Michael Leardi Keith Li and Jeremy Miller – said they did uncover ""several"" active malware infections on the network including Shlayer North Korean-attributed SHARPEXT and NetSupport RAT.

Let's start with the code that has ties to the Supreme Leader himself. It appears someone had SHARPEXT on their machine – either bringing it into the conference or picking it up while there – or something was imitating it judging from network traffic.

""During the conference we observed numerous callouts from four unique hosts to three domains associated with the North Korean malware SHARPEXT"" the IronNet threat hunters documented.

Volexity in late July linked this email-siphoning malware to the Pyongyang-backed Kimsuky crew aka SharpTongue.

It's notable because rather than stealing users' email credentials the malware – which is basically a malicious extension for Chromium-based browsers – reads messages and exfiltrates data from victims' webmail accounts as they leaf through their inboxes. The SHARPEXT extension is typically installed on a victim's Windows PC once it's been compromised via some other vulnerability or infection route.

""Given North Korean threat actors' demonstrated interest in compromising security researchers over the past two years our observation of the North Korean SHARPEXT malware on the Black Hat network is notable in itself due to its use by so many cyber researchers and security employees"" according to IronNet's team.

However they admit the DNS queries to SHARPEXT command-and-control servers remains ""puzzling."" While there were successful DNS responses from these domains there wasn't any outbound communication after the DNS lookup.

""It's possible that geographic filtering was at play here but this is not how we would expect to see it done and not something we frequently see done using DNS"" the hunters theorized. ""Therefore we do not have a good answer for the reason behind this activity.""

Or it could just be someone poking SHARPEXT's servers manually with DNS queries we hazard to guess.

Shlayer malware download

In addition to SHARPEXT the NOC also observed a Shlayer malware infection that had fully compromised a victim's macOS computer we're told. The attendee's Mac may well have been hijacked by the software nasty prior to the event. The threat hunters noted:

Our first indication of malicious activity came in the form of an alert for outbound HTTP POSTs to api.commondevice[.]com with encrypted blobs of data which appeared to be post-compromise C2 communications.

Further investigation uncovered HTTP GET requests retrieving a ZIP archive file flagged as malicious in VirusTotal that didn't end in "".zip"" which was likely an attempt to evade detection.

And all of this ""closely matched"" activity outlined by Kaspersky in that threat intel firm's analysis of the Shlayer Trojan.

I smell a NetSupport RAT

In another case of an attendee coming to the conference with an infected device someone showed up with the NetSupport RAT (aka NetSupport Manager RAT) on their computer.

This like many legitimate remote access tools is frequently co-opted by cybercriminals to commandeer someone's machine snoop on them and steal information. The RAT can be run on multiple OSes including Windows.

The infected device made HTTP POST requests to an outside server and communications matched closely to Zscaler's analysis of the info-stealing RAT's activity.

""A concerning element about this case was that the C2 infrastructure was fully operational and responding"" the threat hunters noted. ""This was unexpected: given the age of this malware we frequently see old infections like this with inactive C2 infrastructure that does not respond.""

Eh could have been worse

Yes we know it's such a surprise: malware found at malware convention. Overall the NOC team was pleasantly surprised by the lower-than-expected level of malicious activity at the show.

About 20000 people attended the annual infosec summer camp in Las Vegas this year which is three times more than in 2021. But compared to last year ""we saw a relatively low amount of network traffic and a lower number of detections across the board by all of the organizations defending the NOC"" the IronNet team said.

Other Black Hat NOC defenders came from Optiv IBM X-Force Cisco NetWitness Palo Alto Networks and Gigamon.

""The ratio of network traffic volume in 2022 was 0.63 Gb/second per 5000 people versus 1.5Gb/second for 5000 people in 2021"" the IronNet team noted.

""We also did not see as much malicious activity stemming from real malware activity as we expected this year.""

And while more attendees attending more classes did mean higher overall detections ""the relative volume of authentic detections was lower than expected given the massive increase in the number of in-person attendees"" they said. ""We don't know the definitive reason behind this trend but we do welcome it."" ®",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbGNhbGlzdGVjaC5jb20vY3RlY2huZXdzL2FydGljbGUvcnl1dXVsN2tv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cyberstarts closes new $60 million Seed fund | Ctech,"Cyberstarts an Israel venture capital firm focused on cybersecurity announced on Wednesday the closing of Seed Fund III with $60 million committed capital to invest in early stage cybersecurity companies.

Doc and Is “Interested” in What “Our Best Writers” Have to Say About Roe v. Wade Reversal,"Paramount Global top executive David Nevins told a U.K. TV industry event on Thursday that he is interested to see what writers have to say about the Supreme Court’s overturning of abortion rights and revealed an upcoming Showtime documentary about comedian Louis CK and his return after a sexual harassment scandal.

Louis C.K. is “a slightly different situation (from Harvey Weinstein) a great great comedian who has come back in his own way” the chairman and CEO Paramount Premium Group and chief creative officer Paramount+ scripted series said in his return to the Edinburgh TV Festival after seven years. He mentioned the project involves the New York Times reporters who broke the original story that the comic had been accused of sexual misconduct by several women. Nevins called it “a very interesting documentary which I haven’t seen yet but I am looking forward to” doing so. “It is going to deal with all the ‘where are we now four five years later after the Weinstein story broke.”

During his festival appearance Nevins signaled that the doc would explore the broader state of the debate on sexual harassment and #MeToo. “I don’t think the social changes that #MeToo has brought about are resolved at all” he said. “It is really complicated. And there is a bit of backlash against #MeToo – (the question now often is) who needs to go away and who is allowed to come back.”

Asked by THR about further details the executive said he doesn’t have additional details about the doc to share at this stage.

Former Sky Studios boss Jane Millichip who will take over as BAFTA CEO in October also quizzed Nevins on the current landscape of scripted content his experiences in maximizing creativity managing talent relationships and intellectual property as well as whether the industry can sustain all the current streaming services.

Asked about the Supreme Court’s overturning Roe v. Wade and whether the resulting renewed debate about abortion rights will play into future content and whether the entertainment and TV industries have a duty here Nevins said: “I am interested to see what our best writers have to say. I think it makes for interesting television. I don’t know if I feel I have a duty but I have an interest.”

Nevins also shared that “I will encourage any writer or producer who has something interesting to say” adding later: “I always want to encourage writers with interesting things to say.” He explained that “I believe in the Trojan horse theory of television” where creators can present various genres and at the same time end up “touching on things that affect people’s lives.” Upcoming gothic thriller The Woman in the Wall starring Ruth Wilson which Showtime and BBC commissioned is “a weird interesting British” horror series for example Nevins said. “We commissioned that before Roe v. Wade was overturned. It is a weird little horror story … It will inevitably feel like it is reflecting the moment we are in now.”

He also said that amid the war in Ukraine Billions will have “very interesting things to say” about Russian oligarchs in London given the show “has a particular angle on it.”

The executive showed sneak peeks of such upcoming content as Grease the new season of Your Honor starring Bryan Cranston a judge confronting his deepest convictions when his son is involved in a hit and run and drama series American Gigolo starring Jon Bernthal (We Own This City) in the titular role for the reimagining of the iconic 1980 film.

“On some level moral bankruptcy is always interesting” Nevins said adding that Cranston is just a great actor. Season 1 of Your Honor was about the protagonist’s “descent into hell” Nevins said. Season 2 is about “the hell he now has to live in” he added. “It starts really low. And he added: “Like any great actor Bryan Cranston is a glutton for suffering.” The star lost a lot of weight and grew “a crazy beard” Nevins shared. The show is based on a format an Israeli show that he never saw. he mentioned. The show was mostly written before George Floyd. But it gave it “relevance and direction” Nevins said. “It definitely (impacted) how (Peter) Moffatt wrote the subsequent episodes.”

Nevins on Thursday also addressed the importance of known franchises and intellectual property saying its rise on TV and beyond “is not a coincidence.” He touted Halo as the no. 1 show around the world driving sign-ups for Paramount+ “by a long shot” while it is no. 2 in the U.S. “It will be a big show for a long time because there are so many ways it can go” he predicted.

On Grease he said it is “a beloved film that has transcended generations” which the company will bring into the present day.

Asked about ordering shows for a global versus a local audience Nevins mentioned gangster drama Sexy Beast as an example for how things have changed in the streaming age. “I had seen the script” back before the Viacom-CBS merger around five years ago he shared. At the time he felt it was “really good” but was “a little bit too British for Showtime.” But now things have changed. “It is a very different mindset when you are competing for subscribers” in the U.K. Ireland and beyond the executive said. “The calculus flipped. Now Sexy Beast makes a lot of sense.” How will it do? “I expect it to do really well in the U.K. and pretty well in the U.S.” Nevins said.

How does he want Paramount+ to be positioned and feel to consumers? “I want Paramount+ to feel like it is accessible” including having “some movie excitement to it.”

Former Showtime chief Nevins last year added oversight of originals at streamer Paramount+ to his portfolio and then also absorbed Paramount TV Studios while CBS Studios is part of the portfolio of CBS Corp. CEO George Cheeks.

Paramount ended June with 63.7 million global streaming subscribers including 43.3 million Paramount+ subs.

At Paramount Nevins is responsible for the development and deployment of scripted originals including dramas and comedies for Paramount+ and for overseeing all aspects of Showtime Networks and its channels BET and Paramount Television Studios.

He has been credited for playing a key role in the collaboration between Paramount+ and Showtime on the original series Halo. His team has also developed such Paramount+ series as The Offer and Grease: Rise of the Pink Ladies.

He also works closely with Paramount Global’s international and domestic distribution groups on the monetization of Showtime Networks content around the world.

Since Nevins joined the company in 2010 Showtime launched its stand-alone streaming service and such hit series as Yellowjackets Dexter: New Blood Billions Ray Donovan The Affair and Homeland.

Before joining Showtime Nevins was an Emmy Award-winning producer and network programming executive. He served as president of Imagine Television from 2002 until 2010. Before that he served as executive vp of programming at Fox Broadcasting and as senior vp primetime series at NBC.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYXJhbW91bnRwcmVzc2V4cHJlc3MuY29tL3Nob3d0aW1lL3JlbGVhc2VzLz92aWV3PTEwMDcyNi1lbW15LXdpbm5lci1ld2FuLW1jZ3JlZ29yLXRvLXN0YXItaW4tdXBjb21pbmctc2hvd3RpbWUtZHJhbWEtYS1nZW50bGVtYW4taW4tbW9zY2930gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EMMY WINNER EWAN MCGREGOR TO STAR IN UPCOMING SHOWTIME DRAMA A GENTLEMAN IN MOSCOW,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4L2V3YW4tbWNncmVnb3ItZGF2aWQtbmV2aW5zLWEtZ2VudGxlbWFuLWluLW1vc2Nvdy1lZGluYnVyZ2gtdHYtZmVzdGl2YWwtc2hvd3RpbWUtcGFyYW1vdW50LTEyMzUwOTgxMTAv0gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvZXdhbi1tY2dyZWdvci1kYXZpZC1uZXZpbnMtYS1nZW50bGVtYW4taW4tbW9zY293LWVkaW5idXJnaC10di1mZXN0aXZhbC1zaG93dGltZS1wYXJhbW91bnQtMTIzNTA5ODExMC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ewan McGregor To Front Paramount+ Drama ‘A Gentleman In Moscow’ As Paramount Content Chief David Nevins Talks International Originals & Franchises — Edinburgh TV Festival,"Ewan McGregor (Obi Wan Kenobi) has been cast as the lead in Paramount+’s upcoming UK drama series A Gentleman in Moscow replacing Kenneth Branagh news that came as Paramount Premium Group CEO David Nevins laid out his vision for Paramount+’s international expansion and talked creativity at the Edinburgh TV Festival.

Emmy-Award winning actor McGregor will play Count Alexander Rostov who in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution finds that his gilded past places him on the wrong side of history in the adaptation of Amor Towles’ international best-selling novel that heads into production later this year.

McGregor’s character synopsis continues: “Spared immediate execution he is banished by a Soviet tribunal to an attic room in the opulent Hotel Metropol threatened with death if he ever sets foot outside again. As the years pass and some of the most tumultuous decades in Russian history unfold outside the hotel’s doors Rostov’s reduced circumstances provide him entry into a much larger world of emotional discovery. As he builds a new life within the walls of the hotel he discovers the true value of friendship family and love.”

Branagh was announced in the role back in 2018 as Deadline revealed at the time but McGregor will now play the Count.

McGregor said: “It’s an amazing wonderful story and I am very excited to get to play such a fabulous role.”

Paramount content chief Nevins who also oversees Showtime made the announcement today at the Edinburgh TV Festival during an interview conversation with former Sky Studios exec and new BAFTA CEO Jane Millichip during which he also unveiled Antoine Fuqua’s Showtime series King Shaka and a Showtime doc about disgraced comedian Louis C.K.

Nevins said the latter the title of which wasn’t revealed would follow New York Times reporters who broke the story about accusations of sexual misconduct against the stand up. “I don’t think the social change that #MetToo has brought about is resolved at all” he added. “There’s a bit of backlash against #MeToo — who has to go away and who’s allowed to come back.”

Paramount+ International original A Gentleman in Moscow will be produced by eOne in association with VIS the international studio division of Paramount Global and will air on Showtime in the U.S. It’s the first production to come through eOne’s first-look deal with Tom Harper’s company Popcorn Storm Pictures.

Harper said: “The book is a rare and delicious treat and I fell in love with it the moment I picked it up 6 years ago. We are thrilled that Amor entrusted this brilliant team with bringing the Metropol to life and couldn’t be more delighted that Ewan will be playing the Count.”

McGregor will be an executive producer on the series alongside showrunner Ben Vanstone (All Creatures Great and Small The Last Kingdom) Harper (War and Peace Peaky Blinders) Xavier Marchand (Nautilus Mrs Harris Goes to Paris) and author Amor Towles whose novel has sold more than four million copies worldwide.

McGregor is represented by UTA Narrative and Sloane Offer Weber & Dern. Towles is repped by WME.

Expansion Plans

Paramount+ plans to commission 150 international originals by 2025 and A Gentleman in Moscow will debut in 2023 in the UK and all Paramount+ international markets alongside other British originals such as The Flatshare Sexy Beast and No Escape. The service is set to launch in Italy next month and Germany Switzerland Austria and France later this year before ramping up its distribution. Comcast joint venture SkyShowtime will launch in several other territories adjacently.

Nevins told Deadline in an exclusive interview before his Edinburgh session that Paramount was taking a more measure approach to the streamer’s rollout than other global services but predicted launches across Europe and numerous other territories within the next few years.

He noted how the international expansion had led him to reassess the potential of projects such as Sexy Beast which is based on the 2000 British gangster film of the same name. It was first pitched to him when he was only leading channel Showtime but he had felt it was not right solely for a U.S. cable audience.

“There’s a reason why Sexy Beast was not greenlit when I first saw it five or six years ago” he said. “Now I’m looking for a subscriber in Bristol or Aberdeen — those subscribers are just as good as a subscriber in Denver or Houston. But we’re not making Sexy Beast just for the British market. I think it’s gonna do well in the U.S. and the UK and I think it will play in Italy and France too. The kinds of things that I’m focused on are hopefully going to move across territories.”

He noted that Paramount’s local commissioning infrastructures in Europe where the company has numerous linear channels would help Paramount+ reach its target of international series orders. In the UK where Paramount owns terrestrial network Channel 5 this model has already led to several significant commissions.

Back in the session Nevins pointed to the impact of global streaming when addressing how Paramount and Showtime have lent into existing IP. “It’s not a coincidence that this rise of franchise and known IP corresponded with the explosion of choice in a non-linear environment” he said. “That is the Darwinian ecosystem of television.”

He noted how Halo had become second most watched show on Paramount+ with an audience far broader than those that play the video games while Grease: Rise of the Pink Ladies a spin-off of the 1978 musical movie was about bringing a “beloved movie that’s transcended generations… into a new age.”

He also pointed to series remake of Paul Schrader’s American Gigolo whose progenitors had smaller more cult followings. “They can be treated quite differently” he added.

Elsewhere Millichip questioned Nevins whether he believed the U.S. entertainment industry had a duty to respond to the politically-charged decision making of the Supreme Court such as the repealing of Roe vs Wade and relaxing of gun laws.

“I don’t know if I have a duty but I certainly have an interest” he replied noting that the recently commissioned BBC co-production The Woman in the Wall starring Ruth Wilson which explores the Catholic Church’s notorious Magdalene Laundries where ‘fallen women’ were sent to atone for ‘sins’ such as adultery and teenage pregnancy.

“It will inevitably feel like it’s reflecting the moment we are living in now” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMi90di9nbG9iYWwvZXdhbi1tY2dyZWdvci1wYXJhbW91bnQtcGx1cy1hLWdlbnRsZW1hbi1pbi1tb3Njb3ctMTIzNTM1MDA2My_SAWVodHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjIvdHYvZ2xvYmFsL2V3YW4tbWNncmVnb3ItcGFyYW1vdW50LXBsdXMtYS1nZW50bGVtYW4taW4tbW9zY293LTEyMzUzNTAwNjMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ewan McGregor to Star in Paramount+ Drama ‘A Gentleman In Moscow’,"Ewan McGregor is set to star in “A Gentleman in Moscow” the adaptation of Amor Towles’ novel for Paramount+ and Showtime.

But first he needs to clear some regulatory hurdles.

The school is proposed for a building formerly occupied by Paychex opposite Empire State College on Westfall Road.

Jerry Goldman the attorney and agent for the recently incorporated Golisano Business Center of Excellence told the Brighton Planning Board that the school would offer a two-year program

“It will be a very intensive program” Goldman said. “And the cost to attend will be significantly less expensive than a traditional four-year program.”

Golisano is developing the concept which is focused on areas of working in or running a business records show. The curriculum is in development.

“At this point this is not intended to be a degree-bearing facility” Goldman told the board. “We expect that graduates will come out with a certificate.”

But first the town of Brighton must grant a conditional use permit. Town code allows for a school in that area as a conditional use. The question is whether a school must be state-licensed – and whether Golisano will seek such a license.

His representatives declined comment through a spokeswoman. As of Tuesday no application had been submitted to the state Department of Education.

If opened the school is expected to enroll 250 students the first year eventually grow to 500 and employ 50 to 60 staff and faculty records show. Upward of 650 people previously worked at the building.

The town Planning Board tabled the matter and could take it up again in September. Monroe County also is reviewing the proposal.",,,

The Thunder will play six games with three games in the state of Oklahoma.

The Thunder opens the preseason with a trip to play the Denver Nuggets on Oct. 3 before returning home to Oklahoma beginning on Oct. 5 versus the Dallas Mavericks at the BOK Center. Oklahoma City will play two international opponents at home hosting the Adelaide 36ers on Oct. 6 and the Maccabi Ra’anana on Oct. 9 at Paycom Center.

They will play a total of three games before they begin the regular season.

The Mavericks begin their preseason action on Wednesday Oct. 5 at 7 p.m. CT when they take on the Oklahoma City Thunder. Instead of being a regular road game at Paycom Center it will be hosted at BOK Center in Tulsa.

The Thunder selected Chet Holmgren with the No. 2 overall pick in this year's NBA Draft but he will not be available to play. He was ruled out for the entire 2022-23 season after suffering a foot injury during a Pro-Am game in Seattle.

Next on the Mavericks' preseason schedule will be their first matchup against Paolo Banchero and the Orlando Magic. It will be the only preseason game played at American Airlines Center and will take place on Friday Oct. 7 at 7:30 p.m. CT.

To wrap up the 2022-23 preseason the Mavericks will face the Utah Jazz on Friday Oct. 14 at 8:00 p.m. CT at Vivint Arena in Salt Lake City. It remains to be seen if All-Star guard Donovan Mitchell will be on the roster at that time given his continued inclusion in trade rumors.

The Mavericks' preseason opener will be streamed on the team's official website while their two final preseason games will be televised on Bally Sports Southwest.

For radio listeners each of the games will be broadcast on 97.1 The Eagle (KEGL) with a Spanish broadcast on Univision 99.1 FM (KFZO).

To open the 2022-23 regular season the Mavericks will take on the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday Oct. 19 at 9 p.m. CT on ESPN.

The new product has been created in partnership with National Philanthropic Trust (NPT) and Vanguard Charitable and allows Donor-Advised Fund (DAF) sponsors community foundations and other grantmakers to move their donations electronically through PayPal’s platform.

In addition to moving money quickly the system includes an online Grant Payments dashboard available to grantmakers and charities alike where they can view all the grant details including the donor information which can be exported to help simplify record keeping. The dashboard also includes other details like the grant letter and terms and conditions allowing the organization to decide to either accept or decline the grant. If accepted the funds are made available in a day’s time. If declined the organization can specify a reason and return the funds.

PayPal notes that the participating U.S. charities are vetted before being onboarded to this system.

The company points to the sizable market in charitable giving as a reason for entering this space with a new product.

Citing data from National Philanthropic Trust grants from Donor-Advised Funds hit historic levels during the pandemic in 2020 with grants from DAFs then totaling $34.67 billion up 27% from the year prior. This was the highest increase in a decade PayPal says in its announcement. In addition Vanguard Charitable sent out $1.78 billion and NPT sent out $6.4 billion in grants to charities in 2021. Nearly all these payments were made via check however.

Sending a check means relying on the Postal Service and requires resources time and expenses in order to manage the mailbox retrieve the checks and make the bank deposits. This can slow down the actual work that needs to be done. PayPal believes its system which will work much as its standard electronic payments do today will allow charitable organizations to better focus on the tasks at hand instead of managing donations. Of course PayPal itself also benefits by increasing the flow of money through its payments network where it can be subject to various transaction fees.

The company additionally notes it has entered into a commercial arrangement with grantmakers like National Philanthropic Trust and Vanguard Charitable to enable them to provide this new solution to their charitable communities. It didn’t share the details of those agreements.

“We are thrilled to partner with PayPal and NPT to bring modern and effective granting solutions to our donors and non-profit partners alike” said Rebecca Moffett president of Vanguard Charitable in a statement. “Charities today need sustainable donor support more than ever. By streamlining the granting process donors can make an even greater – and faster – impact on meaningful cause areas. We look forward to continuing to bring innovative solutions to the granting space ensuring that we’re always working to increase philanthropy and maximize its impact over time.”

Eileen Heisman CEO of National Philanthropic Trust said Grant Payments would “simplify and accelerate how grantmakers can get funds to non-profits for mission-critical programs” in a further statement. “The partnership with PayPal and Vanguard Charitable on this sector-wide solution could be a game-changer for other funders as well and has been enormously gratifying” Heisman added.

This is not PayPal’s first foray into charitable giving of course. The company has offered tools to enable charitable transactions for years. Back in 2016 for instance PayPal added a new button inside its mobile app to connect users to its thousands of PayPal Giving Fund certified charities which previously were only available online. It later experimented with money pools and in late 2020 launched a GoFundMe competitor with its crowdsourced fundraising platform the Generosity Network. Outside of charities PayPal also offers its own grants to small businesses through Venmo.

Today PayPal supports more than 600000 nonprofits with fundraising and engages a community of over 400 million consumers and merchants to contribute to charitable efforts.

National Philanthropic Trust will start to roll out Grant Payments later this month while Vanguard Charitable will begin to offer the solution in 2023. The company says Grant Payments will enable more 200000 PayPal-confirmed charities to quickly receive grants electronically. Other charities can ask for more information by emailing PayPal at grantpayments@paypal.com.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vbmV3cy9lY29tbWVyY2UvMjAyMi9wYXlwYWwtaG9uZXktc3dlZXRlbnMtdGhlLXBvdC1mb3Itc2hvcHBlcnMtYW5kLW1lcmNoYW50cy1hcy1ob2xpZGF5cy1hcHByb2FjaC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PayPal Honey Sweetens the Pot for Shoppers and Merchants As Holidays Approach,"When PayPal acquired discounting app Honey in early 2020 for $4 billion in cash it presaged the beefed-up rewards and cash back power of the two properties combined.

With the July announcement that the rebranded PayPal Honey is now a mobile Safari extension Honey-loving PayPal users now have a more safe and seamless way to save.

CEO Dan Schulman noted on PayPal’s second-quarter earnings call that Honey has saved PayPal users $100 million since joining the family. And Chris Hammer VP and GM of Global Shopping at PayPal told PYMNTS’ Karen Webster that the new browser extension ensures users can find more merchants and savings within the payments ecosystem.

For the consumer Hammer said the new mobile browser extension “means bringing a lot of the incentives and rewards content” Honey is known for to more shoppers. At the same time for merchants it creates “a great opportunity for incremental leads and customer acquisition for our key brands where they get the opportunity to find the most engaged PayPal users and really have a chance to create a relationship with them.”

By driving savings and strengthening merchant-consumer bonds when The Consumer Price Index (CPI) hovers at alarming levels Hammer said the benefits of having real-time insights with merchants and consumers present tangible value when needed.

Because of this two-sided relationship he said “we’re getting a lot of those signals real time which tell us that these are the most important categories where the spend is shifting. This is where they need the savings the most. This is where we need to make sure we’ve got the right merchant participation. These are the price points that are most tolerable for consumers.”

It’s not that broader behavior across the platform is demonstrably different but rather that “we haven’t always known what that behavior shifts to until you do a retrospective. Then you get into this mode of trying to say what should we have done? We’re just in a better position to do it now and give that support and help now versus the next time.”

Habituated to Saving

As learnings pour in from several years of Honey use now significantly enhanced by the mobile browser extension PayPal now knows the value consumers assign to features like automatic couponing cash back and rewards particularly with their spending under a microscope.

By providing the technology that gives shoppers confidence they’re getting the best price facilitated by tech he said “We see a lot of engagement with that part of the experience. As we bring that content those incentives those cash back rewards into our PayPal app and top of funnel in PayPal.com we’re seeing a lot more engagement around those offers and deals and not as an afterthought.”

“We’re actually seeing habituation to the idea of I’m going to go look for all those opportunities to save money before I go on a shopping journey.”

Webster noted that consumers cringe when they miss out on an appealing sale. PayPal Honey handles this with unintrusive reminders to complete unfinished shopping journeys offering incentives to do so and doing so in a flow that helps consumers and merchants.

Pointing to the difficulty merchants have sending the right offers to the relevant consumers Hammer said “What we are able to do is become a highly efficient way of knowing our consumers knowing what those discount needs might be to convert the sale without just making it a race to the bottom where you’re always pushing constant discounts.”

This helps merchants make smart discounting and incentive decisions while “not over offering to consumers that don’t necessarily need it as much versus those that really need that extra boost to be able to bring it forward and do it all in one environment so that the consumer doesn’t have to stretch to 15 different places to finally end up back at that merchant site.”

Freedom from FOMO

The endgame isn’t just discounting for one-off conversions but making savings the heart of relationship building between merchants and customers that endure beyond the sale.

Hammer said “Our consumers have always trusted us for safe fast and effective checkout. What we’re doing now is … making sure you’ve got access to all the right coupon and discount codes even in those rare cases where it comes back and says ‘sorry you already have the best price’ there’s value in that too. It’s peace of mind.” Call it freedom from FOMO.

At some point this converges with consumer desires for super apps that aggregate their shopping and spending into one interface that does it all with cash and prizes to be had.

“The concept of a super app means you need to expand those offerings and those capabilities” he said. “Shopping by way of cash back rewards and incentives and coupons and deals is another way to remind a consumer as to what PayPal can actually do for them.”

It plays to consumers’ love of saving money and time which Hammer believes will form the value prop around super apps that will bring about more adoption and engagement.

He said consumers would begin to realize that “this is something that makes sense for me to start my shopping journey on not just come to check a balance not just come to make sure I’ve got the right FIs loaded. We really do believe that these relatively new experiences and opportunities for our consumers round out that super app concept and put commerce squarely in the focus of how we want our consumers to engage with us.”

As much attention as PayPal is placing on savings and the super app concept merchants want reassurance in a stormy economy and a digital assist from partners like PayPal to weather it.

What merchants want from PayPal in 2022 is “high quality leads that ultimately translate into increased revenue and sales over this critical holiday period. What we’re also doing is making sure that any of these new engagement points are not distracting” because the holidays are not the time to approach merchants about new integrations and contracts he said.

Instead Hammer said PayPal is helping merchant partners get their holiday houses in order and “getting all the right incentive content to be able to push out there because we’re doing it in a seamless way that is meant to help facilitate this commerce flywheel for everyone.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5lcmR3YWxsZXQuY29tL2FydGljbGUvc21hbGwtYnVzaW5lc3MvcGF5cGFsLWJ1c2luZXNzLXJldmlld9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PayPal Business Account Review for 2024: How It Works Who Should Get One,"5.0 NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team.

PayPal Business accounts are PayPal accounts that allow small and medium-size businesses to send and receive payments in person and online.

PayPal Business pros

Ease of use

One of the biggest advantages of using PayPal Business as your payment processor is how straightforward the platform is for both you and your customers. Simple integration is available with a majority of website hosts and shopping carts making it a quick and easy way to start accepting payments as soon as you start your business.

Ubiquity

PayPal is one of the most commonly used payment processing platforms which makes it a go-to for customers and merchants alike. Many users will already be familiar with PayPal so the interface likely won’t be a big adjustment for new business owners. Because so many people use PayPal there's also more information available online about how to troubleshoot specific problems — for example on the company's large online forum for merchants PayPal Community.

Transparent fees

PayPal’s flat-rate per-transaction fees are extremely transparent allowing merchants to accurately predict their monthly payment processing costs.

PayPal Business cons

Not for high-risk businesses

New merchants looking to use PayPal as their payment processor must adhere to the platform’s Acceptable Use Policy and the platform has fairly strict standards. The company requires preapproval to accept payments for certain items that are age-restricted or have a high risk for card fraud or chargebacks including for high-value items products like alcohol and tobacco or items on online marketplaces. The company also doesn't support certain high-risk merchants such as businesses that sell firearms or drug paraphernalia.

If your business is in one of these industries consider going with a high-risk merchant account instead.

Withheld funds and frozen accounts

PayPal’s strict terms of use though helpful for user safety can sometimes result in wrongful fund withholding account freezing and even account termination. The platform has been known to flag “suspicious behavior” such as sudden increases in processing volume vague product descriptions and more. This problem has also been noted with other payment service providers including competitors like Square and Stripe.

Customer service

Though PayPal Business offers phone support at 888-883-9770 from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Central time Monday through Friday text support an online community forum and a resolution center for transaction or account issues the usefulness of the support is hit-or-miss according to reviews. Customer service representatives’ expertise is said to vary.

PayPal Business alternatives

Square

Payment processing:

2.6% plus 10 cents for in-person transactions.

2.9% plus 30 cents for online transactions.

3.5% plus 15 cents for manually keyed transactions.

3.3% plus 30 cents for invoices.

Why we like it: Square is a popular payment processor with many of the same features as PayPal Business at a slightly lower cost. Square unlike PayPal offers virtual terminal access at no additional charge. It doesn’t offer multi-currency capabilities though. It may be a better option if you’re looking for more customization options and aren’t planning to expand your business internationally.

The deal also includes facilities in Aparecida de Goiânia and Itaporanga D’Ajuda. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.

In addition to the acquisition of the cookie and cracker brands Camil Alimentos said it has signed a 10-year licensing contract with PepsiCo for the Toddy brand for use in certain products in the Brazilian biscuit market and the acquisition of the assets that make up the Toddy brand biscuit production line. According to Camil Alimentos the Toddy brand is the second largest cookie brand in Brazil.

“In just over a year since July 2021 we have made five acquisitions that have allowed us in addition to entering new countries such as Ecuador to expand our business in three different categories with high added value and brands that are recognized by consumers: coffee pasta and healthy products in Uruguay with Silcom” said Luciano Quartiero chief executive officer of Camil Alimentos. “This will be our sixth transaction announced which includes the company’s entry into the cookies and crackers category in Brazil. The diversity of businesses increases the operating synergy of our business model allowing for gains in scale and greater expertise in different models of distribution supplies and trade marketing.”

Camil Alimentos said the acquisition reinforces its strategy to grow in regions that are complementary to its current operations and will include in its portfolio the category of cookies and crackers with highly recognized brands in the market and products with high added value. The addition of the PepsiCo Brasil businesses brings synergies linked to the company’s cross-selling business model and scale gains as well as complementarity with the pasta business acquired in August 2021 by Camil Alimentos and successfully integrated into the business model the company said.

He has also now clocked up 27 years with PepsiCo in a variety of roles and still loves his job as much as ever.

“This may sound a bit cheesy but for me this really is like a dream come true” Eugene CEO of PepsiCo Africa Middle East and South Asia (AMESA) shares. “AMESA is a fantastic geography with a lot of potential and it is a great team to work with. I really enjoy what I’m doing every single day.”

This is partly due to PepsiCo’s latest evolution Eugene says.

“We want to be the leading food and beverage company in the markets where we operate by what we call ‘Winning with Purpose’” he says.

“Recently we refined that down to ‘Winning with PepsiCo Positive’ or ‘Pep+’. Our mantra is to make our company ‘Faster Stronger Better’ through our strategic framework underpinned by what we call the PepsiCo Way Behaviours.”

Those behaviours encompass putting customers first in everything they do creating a culture where people really act and feel empowered to act as owners raising the bar on talent and diversity and integrity which is key for Eugene.

“For me integrity is the behaviour that ultimately underpins all the other ones” he explains. “It’s really important that each of us every single day acts with integrity so that we can all look at ourselves in the mirror once we’ve made decisions.”

It’s really important that each of us every single day acts with integrity so that we can all look at ourselves in the mirror once we’ve made decisions.

Time for pep+

While the PepsiCo Way Behaviours aim to change the culture Pep+ looks to change everything else the company touches.

“Pep+ for us is a strategy to completely transform the food system from the way that we grow the crops that we source to how we produce and make those products to ultimately how we sell them and how consumers can consume them and dispose of whatever is left in terms of packaging material” he says.

“It’s more than just a sustainability strategy. For us it’s about transforming the food system end-to-end.”

That strategy involves working with more than 250000 people in the agriculture supply chain on about 25 different crops from potatoes to sugar. PepsiCo has committed to scale regenerative agricultural practices across seven million acres equivalent to its entire agricultural footprint – a massive undertaking it is set to deliver by 2030.

I’m now responsible for a team of 26000 people across 74 markets that are very committed every single day to delivering to the best of their ability but also to win in the marketplace.

Pep+ also involves becoming a net zero company by 2040 and water net positive by 2030 as well as minimising the amount of packaging used and maximising recycling practices – with some alternative business models that don’t use any single-use packaging at all.

The company also wants to guide consumers towards healthier choices with a concerted effort to reduce added sugar saturated fat and sodium and increase the use of fruit nuts and chickpeas.

On a day-to-day basis it’s a huge job for the company and for Eugene personally.

“I’m now responsible for a team of 26000 people across 74 markets that are very committed every single day to delivering to the best of their ability but also to win in the marketplace.”

Faster stronger better

And so far in the AMESA region it is winning.

“We serve 3.5 billion consumers and gained share in most of the markets and most of the categories in which we compete” Eugene says proudly. “We’re also making very solid progress in making the company stronger in terms of the capabilities that we have with a very specific focus on commercial capabilities.

“Precision selling enabled by digital technologies allows us to ensure that wherever the consumer is looking for our products we have the right range displayed in the right format in the right channels.”

Eugene’s team is also making progress in the areas of consumer-centricity quality of marketing and reduction of water usage in territories such as Egypt South Africa and Pakistan.

With this the PepsiCo Foundation is doing some innovative charitable work with the program She Feeds the World which is helping empower female farmers. There is also a development fund in South Africa helping to build agricultural and entrepreneurial skills in underprivileged areas.

I think the strategic framework is clear that we’re going to continue to focus on accelerating our growth but also on building stronger capabilities within our organisation.

A golden opportunity

The upcoming months are particularly exciting for AMESA with the COP27 being held in Egypt. Climate change impacts and its increasing vulnerability on food systems is felt even more so on the African continent.

“I believe that the ‘Africa COP’ presents a golden opportunity for us as a region to champion the climate change agenda by sharing best practices and driving concrete action that extends beyond the COP” Eugene says. “I am proud of our marquee regenerative agriculture initiatives as well as food and water security programs in Egypt and Sub-Saharan Africa that are transforming lives making them stronger better healthier and empowered.

“With our plans to mobilise sustainable innovation and entrepreneurship we believe that COP27 will serve as a key moment to lift up the region’s profile as a global leader in sustainability and green economic transformation.”

Over the next three-to-five years Eugene expects the company to become “even faster even stronger and even better”.

“I think the strategic framework is clear that we’re going to continue to focus on accelerating our growth but also on building stronger capabilities within our organisation” he says.

Not surprisingly engagement scores are high and Eugene is proud of the culture at PepsiCo along with the relationships that it fosters externally.

“I really think we have a great culture as a company. And as for our bottling partners some of these relationships have lasted 70 years and in most cases between 30-to-50 years.”

It feels like PepsiCo is a brand that has been with us forever and Eugene doesn’t expect that to change anytime soon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByd2Vlay5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xNzk2NjI2L21jZG9uYWxkcy1yZWNydWl0cy1wZXBzaWNvcy1qb24tYmFubmVyLWdsb2JhbC1jaGllZi1pbXBhY3Qtb2ZmaWNlctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's recruits PepsiCo's Jon Banner as global chief impact officer,"Banner is the former EVP of communications at PepsiCo.

We first start by providing evidence that social engagement is not enough to identify differences between mainstream and alternative sources of information relative to COVID-19 vaccines. In other words users tend to post about alternative and mainstream news at similar rates. However the emotional content of these two sources of news differ drastically in the way they frame the idea of vaccines. Subsequently we focus our attention on perceptions about specific vaccines like AstraZeneca. Lastly we outline how news media reported negative concepts related to vaccines like “mort” (stem for the Italian for death) and “trombos” (thrombosis).

Prevalence of the discourse about vaccines on social networks

Vaccines have been extensively debated both on social and on news media. Keeping track of the popularity of the articles reshared on social media can disclose insights about the ways mainstream and alternative news media described vaccination campaigns. Along with the number of shares on Facebook and Twitter we retrieved the cumulative number of likes for the URLs in the dataset. The news articles in the dataset have been shared 5.3 million times and they gained 3.4 million likes (0.64 per post); the same articles have been shared 192 thousands times on Twitter and they gained 336 thousands likes (1.74 each). Mainstream and Alternative news have been liked similarly (Mainstream: 4.9 million times on Facebook and 108 thousand times on Twitter Alternative: 2.9 million times on Facebook and 83 thousands times on Twitter) but Alternative news on Facebook gained 1.1 likes per post on average. The average number of likes per post however is not enough to tell news coming from Mainstream venues from news coming from Alternative venues. A Wilcoxon test could not reject the hypothesis that the distribution of average likes per post could be the same for Mainstream and Alternative both on Facebook (p value 0.42) and Twitter (p value 0.55).

Figure 1B displays a correlation heatmap of the popularity of posts on the same set of news on Facebook and Twitter (see Methods) namely articles mentioning “vaccin” in their titles. It can be observed a positive correlation among the two measures of popularity (Pearson’s coefficient 0.38 p value \(\ll 0.001\)). The correlation vanishes for extremely popular content which is quite rare and for URLs unpopular on Twitter which can have diverse outcomes on Facebook. The densest mass in the plot is in the middle where news are shared around 14 times on Twitter and 300 to 600 times on Facebook confirming an order of magnitude of shift between the volume of the two social networks. Further details on social media users posting activity about vaccine-related news are provided in the Supplementary Information. Roughly the same positive correlation between Facebook and Twitter resharings persisted for both mainstream (Pearson’s coefficient 0.44 p value \(\ll 0.001\)) and alternative (Pearson’s coefficient 0.41 p value \(\ll 0.001\)) news outlets. This lack of differences indicates that both mainstream and alternative news were re-shared in similar ways across social media platforms in agreement with previous findings19. This also means that differences between mainstream and alternative news is to be searched not only within their online spread but rather in their semantic and emotional content as investigated in the following subsection.

Differences and similarities in the narrative about vaccine in mainstream and alternative news media articles

Unable to distinguish between alternative and mainstream news it has to be underlined that user activity on social media provides also little to no information on the narrative in which vaccines are framed. Hence we rather focus our attention on quantifying the semantic/emotional content of news. To this end we extract the semantic frameworks of selected concepts following a working pipeline explained in Fig. 1A and in Sect. 5 and for starting we explore the semantic framework of the term “vaccin”.

Figure 1C reports that different kinds of media framed the concept of “vaccin” with wildly different emotions. In fact mainstream Italian news media expressed significantly more trust and anticipation as well as less disgust than expected at random (see Methods). Such richly emotional framing of COVID-19 vaccines is completely absent in alternative sources. Whereas mainstream sources consistently framed “vaccin” with mostly positive/trustful jargon for more than 50% of our sampling time window alternative news framed the same concept as emotionless. Our results provide strong evidence that it is not social engagement but rather emotional profiling that strongly characterises sources coming from alternative and mainstream outlets.

However Fig. 1C considers both titles and news bodies. Would these differences persist in case we focused on either of these elements? More importantly would these differences be shared by specific types of vaccines like AstraZeneca?

In Fig. 1D we focus on the AstraZeneca vaccine. Petals without colours in Fig. 1D represent emotions that are not significantly over- or under-expressed in the corpus if compared with a neutral baseline (see Sect. 5). We analyse the time-aggregated emotions that are expressed on this noun over the whole time window always referring to a neutral baseline. It is also interesting to differentiate not only between mainstream and alternative sources but also among bodies and titles of the articles since article headlines are meant to convey information and to catch the reader’s eye in a very limited number of words. Using Plutchik’s flower to represent the eight primary emotions of the model we find interesting differences. Both mainstream and alternative media adopt for their narratives the same emotional structure in the main bodies of their articles. Different choices were made for the titles. Alternative sources expressed way more sadness compared to the baseline while mainstream ones adopt a more positive attitude expressing trust and anticipation.

Perception of vaccine-related dangers: before and after March 15 2021

We can further investigate the emotional approaches to vaccines of mainstream and alternative news media by studying the narratives before and after 15 March 2021. On this day the administration of the VaxZevria (then AstraZeneca) vaccine was temporarily suspended due to a small number of suspect side-effect thrombosis52. An important media fuss was raised over this event since the AstraZeneca vaccine was at that time one of the most used vaccine in Italy on several public worker categories53 (according to the National Vaccination Guidelines valid at that time). To do so we conduct a two-fold analysis by analysing the semantic frameworks in news titles around the words “pfizer” and “astrazenec” through TFMNs as well as around the words “mort” (death) and “thrombos” (thrombosis).

Figure 2 Semantic frames of tightly linked concepts around “astrazenec” in journal news titles from mainstream sources (right) and alternative sources (left) before (top) and after (bottom) the temporary suspension of 15 March 2021. We highlighted with a dot those words discussed in detail in the main text i.e. thrombosis reactions death and allergies. Syntactic links between positive (negative neutral) words are in cyan (red grey). Syntactic links between positive and negative words are in purple. Green links indicate synonyms. Full size image

We highlighted with a dot those words discussed in detail in the main text i.e. thrombosis reactions death and allergies. Syntactic links between positive (negative neutral) words are in cyan (red grey). Syntactic links between positive and negative words are in purple. Green links indicate synonyms. Full size image

Figures 2 and 3 display the communities of tightly connected concepts surrounding respectively “astrazenec” and “pfizer” in their semantic frames as reconstructed from the TFMN. To highlight community structure we used the Louvain algorithm54 as in previous works45. Clustering concepts together in communities can better highlight more tightly connected and thus more semantically related concepts as debated in texts45. These network visualisations report the semantic content associated with the above two entities in the corpus of news titles. Each network visualisation compared titles from mainstream sources (right) and alternative sources (left) before and after (top and bottom) the temporary suspension of VaxZevria on March 15th 2021.

Investigating the semantic content of these networks reveals interesting insights. Before the suspension alternative journals framed “astrazenec” with way less negative associations than “pfizer”. These journal venues concentrated negative associations like allergies reactions and deaths mostly when reporting about Pfizer’s vaccine (cf. 3 top left). These associations are absent in the titles surrounding “astrazenec” (cf. 2 top left). This indicates that alternative journal venues produced titles giving more semantic prominence to allergic/negative reactions to the vaccines mostly when mentioning Pfizer and more rarely when mentioning “astrazenec”. This pattern is flipped when considering titles from mainstream journal venues which feature more negative reaction-related jargon when mentioning “astrazenec” (cf. 2 top right) rather than when talking about “pfizer” (cf. 3 top right). On top on this disparity in reporting negative side effects of different brands of vaccines titles from mainstream journals framed Pfizer with a positive cluster of concepts that is missing from AstraZeneca’s semantic frame and relative to trust spawning from Pfizer’s approval from experts and institutions.

After the temporary suspension of AstraZeneca the semantic frames of “astrazenec” and “pfizer” underwent some drastic changes in the TFMNs obtained from news titles. Pfizer underwent a drastic drop of network degree (− 79%) in the titles from alternative journal venues indicating a reduced semantic richness of language surrounding “pfizer” in those titles and consequently a reduced semantic prominence of Pfizer’s vaccine in such titles (cf. 3 bottom left). Always within titles coming from alternative news media the semantic community of “astrazenec” underwent a densification of negative associations. This included links with thrombosis threat and dangerous that were not present before. Mainstream journals produced semantic communities framing “astrazenec” in similar ways before and after the temporary suspension of the vaccine. Noticeably mainstream venues featured associations with clusters of concepts related to bureaucracy underlining how the vaccine was under further scrutinise.

(B) Distribution of emotions in the semantic frame of “mort” (death) in the titles of mainstream and alternative articles. Full size image

A further analysis driven by the events of March 15 can be conducted by tracking the usage of words associated to the negative events: death and thrombosis the main alleged side effect that was put under the spotlight. An analysis of the prevalence of these two words as shown in Fig. 4A suggests us that both mainstream and alternative media covered these events in a similar way. The words “mort” (death) and “trombos” (thrombosis) have a long history due to its association with the COVID-19 outbreak especially during the peak of casualties in Fall 2020 in both mainstream and alternative news outlets. The two plots show how many of the news produced by mainstream and alternative outlets everyday included the words “mort” (death) and “trombos” (thrombosis) respectively. Daily values were averaged with a moving average of 7 days reducing the noise and increasing the readability of the figures. Indeed they both show a peak of the said words around or after March 15 mentioning death in almost 35% of their articles and thrombosis in the 25% (mainstream) and 30% (alternative) of their articles.

Interestingly “thrombosis” started appearing in article bodies and titles on the eve of March 15 with analogous trends in both mainstream and alternative sources. Whereas “mort/death” in article bodies displays a relative increase of \(+\) 95% around March 15—compared to the start and end of March—in both alternative and mainstream outlets article titles highlight a different pattern: Around March 15 titles of alternative outlets feature “death” 4 times more frequently than titles from mainstream sources. Furthermore in titles from alternative outlets the occurrence of “death” evidently peaks on March 15 a phenomenon absent in titles from mainstream sources. These differences indicate how different sources provided different attention levels to the concept of death and COVID-19 vaccines. Further emotional analysis based on TFMNs reveals how mainstream and alternative titles framed the concept of “death” in emotionally different ways cf. Fig. 4B. Before March 15 “mort/death” was framed with anticipation and trust by mainstream titles perhaps due to the hope of vaccine’s effectiveness; alternative titles did not show such hopeful characterisation. After the suspension however mainstream titles lost the anticipation trait and also the trust decreased; meanwhile “mort” was framed by alternative titles on vaccines as fearful. These quantitative patterns highlight how alternative outlets focused on fearful vaccine narratives after March 15 whereas mainstream sources kept trustful language when mentioning deaths and COVID-19 vaccines.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZWJpb3RlY2guY29tL2Jpb3RlY2gvY2hhc2luZy1nc2stcGZpemVyLXJhY2VzLXJlZ3VsYXRvcnMtYWZ0ZXItcnN2LXZhY2NpbmUtcGFpbnRzLXBvc2l0aXZlLWltcHJlc3Npb24tcmVub2ly0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chasing GSK Pfizer races to regulators after RSV vaccine paints positive impression in RENOIR phase 3,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/chasing-gsk-pfizer-races-regulators-after-rsv-vaccine-paints-positive-impression-renoir on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZWJpb3RlY2guY29tL2Jpb3RlY2gvY2hhc2luZy1nc2stcGZpemVyLXJhY2VzLXJlZ3VsYXRvcnMtYWZ0ZXItcnN2LXZhY2NpbmUtcGFpbnRzLXBvc2l0aXZlLWltcHJlc3Npb24tcmVub2ly0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZXBoYXJtYS5jb20vcGhhcm1hL2pvaG5zb24tam9obnNvbi1sb3N0LXBmaXplci1nbG9iYWwtYmxvb2QtdGhlcmFwZXV0aWNzLWJpZGRpbmctd2FyLWJsb29tYmVyZ9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,J&J lost to Pfizer in $5.4B GBT bidding war: Bloomberg,"Before settling on a $5.4 billion price tag for Global Blood Therapeutics Pfizer had to fight off a mysterious “company A.” Now the identity of that contender has been revealed.

Johnson & Johnson was Pfizer’s rival bidder in acquisition negotiations with Global Blood Therapeutics Bloomberg reports. In fact known as company A J&J was the one that set off the deal talks by proactively contacting GBT with a buyout offer before Pfizer came in according to a securities filing.

J&J in May offered $55 per share to take over the sickle cell disease (SCD) specialist. In the following months the global healthcare giant raised its pitch several times⁠—first to $60 and then to $61.50 the filing shows. Following a report by The Wall Street Journal saying Pfizer was in advanced talks to buy GBT J&J provided its final offer $65 which came below Pfizer’s $67.50.

Had the deal gone J&J’s way GBT would have been J&J’s largest acquisition in about two years and would've represented the conglomerate’s first major transaction under new CEO Joaquin Duato who just took the helm from Alex Gorsky in January. Duato used to head up J&J’s pharma department.

Compared with Pfizer J&J has lately been relatively quiet on the M&A front lately. J&J’s most recent large deal can be traced to its $6.5 billion acquisition of Momenta Pharmaceuticals in 2020. The target was nipocalimab an FcRn inhibitor that holds promise for a range of autoimmune diseases including rare diseases such as myasthenia gravis. At that time Duato was J&J’s vice chairman overseeing strategic directions of both pharma and consumer health as well as global supply chain.

On J&J’s second-quarter earnings call in July Duato noted M&A as “an important component” of J&J’s strategy counting 40 acquisitions groupwide in the past five years. For its pharma business about half of J&J’s projects have come from the outside the company he said.

""We try to look at those opportunities in the context of the improvement in standard of care entering to higher-growth markets and delivering a fair financial return” the CEO said at the time.

In pharma the company’s dealmaking efforts will focus on its key therapeutic areas he added including immunology oncology neuroscience pulmonary hypertension and cardiovascular and metabolism diseases.

Although recent decline in biotech value has created an opportunity for big pharma acquirers Duato said J&J isn’t “opportunistic about it"" and that it’s still “looking always at the fundamentals of these companies.”

For Pfizer GBT brings with it an FDA-approved SCD drug Oxbryta as well as pipeline SCD candidates inclacumab and GBT601. Inclacumab is a P-selectin inhibitor currently in phase 3 trials to evaluate its ability to control vaso-occlusive crises. And GBT601 a sickle hemoglobin polymerization inhibitor holds potential as a “functional cure” for SCD by improving both vaso-occlusion and hemoglobin SVB Securities analysts pointed out in an earlier note.

GBT’s SCD franchise could reach $2.7 billion in annual sales by 2030 according to SVB’s estimates which came above Wall Street consensus of $2 billion the SVB team noted.

J&J has been involved in rare disease drug development for a long time and has paid top dollar for it. Most notably J&J shelled out $30 billion in 2017 to acquire Swiss biotech Actelion and got a stable of pulmonary arterial hypertension drugs.

“Looking at the biopharma M&A landscape more broadly we see the hematology/rare disease sector as an increasingly desirable area given minimal [Federal Trade Commission] risk with specialized diseases minimal payer pushback and the lack of necessity for a large sales force” the SVB team wrote in the note.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2MwNDNlNjkzLWNiMjItNGY0YS1hMGMwLTdhOTIyMDM0NzhiMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pfizer races to beat rivals for slice of $10bn respiratory jab market,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

The results from a 109000-patient Israeli study are likely to renew questions about the U.S. government’s use of Paxlovid which has become the go-to treatment for COVID-19 due to its at-home convenience. The Biden administration has spent more than $10 billion purchasing the drug and making it available at thousands of pharmacies through its test-and-treat initiative.

The researchers found that Paxlovid reduced hospitalizations among people 65 and older by roughly 75% when given shortly after infection. That’s consistent with earlier results used to authorize the drug in the U.S. and other nations.

But people between the ages of 40 and 65 saw no measurable benefit according to the analysis of medical records.

The study has limitations due to its design which compiled data from a large Israeli health system rather than enrolling patients in a randomized study with a control group — the gold-standard for medical research.

The findings reflect the changing nature of the pandemic in which the vast majority of people already have some protection against the virus due to vaccination or prior infection. For younger adults in particular that greatly reduces their risks of severe COVID-19 complications. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently estimated that 95% of Americans 16 and older have acquired some level of immunity against the virus.

“Paxlovid will remain important for people at the highest risk of severe COVID-19 such as seniors and those with compromised immune systems” said Dr. David Boulware a University of Minnesota researcher and physician who was not involved in the study. “But for the vast majority of Americans who are now eligible this really doesn’t have a lot of benefit.”

A spokesman for Pfizer declined to comment on the results which were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized Paxlovid late last year for adults and children 12 and older who are considered high risk due to conditions like obesity diabetes and heart disease. More than 42% of U.S. adults are considered obese representing 138 million Americans according to the CDC.

At the time of the FDA decision there were no options for treating COVID-19 at home and Paxlovid was considered critical to curbing hospitalizations and deaths during the pandemic’s second winter surge. The drug’s results were also far stronger than a competing pill from Merck.

The FDA made its decision based on a Pfizer study in high-risk patients who hadn’t been vaccinated or treated for prior COVID-19 infection.

“Those people do exist but they’re relatively rare because most people now have either gotten vaccinated or they’ve gotten infected” Boulware said.

Pfizer reported earlier this summer that a separate study of Paxlovid in healthy adults — vaccinated and unvaccinated — failed to show a significant benefit. Those results have not yet been published in a medical journal.

More than 3.9 million prescriptions for Paxlovid have been filled since the drug was authorized according to federal records. A treatment course is three pills twice a day for five days.

A White House spokesman on Wednesday pointed to several recent papers suggesting Paxlovid helps reduce hospitalizations among people 50 and older. The studies have not been published in peer-reviewed journals.

“Risk for severe outcomes from COVID is along a gradient and the growing body of evidence is showing that individuals between the ages of 50 and 64 can also benefit from Paxlovid” Kevin Munoz said in an emailed statement.

Administration officials have been working for months to increase use of Paxlovid opening thousands of sites where patients who test positive can fill a prescription. Last month U.S. officials further expanded access by allowing pharmacists to prescribe the drug.

The White House recently signaled that it may soon stop purchasing COVID-19 vaccines drugs and tests shifting responsibility to the private insurance market. Under that scenario insurers could set new criteria for when they would pay for patients to receive Paxlovid.

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

Getting a star athlete on a video call for a reasonable fee was an easy sell to fans but not to the athletes—the company had so many athlete no-shows for calls that the effort was scuttled by constant refunds.

He has higher hopes for his second athlete venture: Finlete which keeps the fan meet-and-greet of the first effort but adds what should be a stronger motivator—more money.

“Finlete is a platform that allows fans to support for now minor league baseball players” Connolly said in a phone call. “And with the current amount of money that these athletes make in the minor leagues there’s a really interesting potential return that people participating in Finlete can see.”

Finlete is a new entry in the increasingly popular financial play of athlete investing in which funds swap an upfront payment to an aspiring pro in exchange for a fixed percentage cut of future sports income. Comcast owns 7% of Finlete’s business while famed venture capitalist Tim Draper has a $50000 seed investment in the endeavor.

For Finlete Connolly sees a lot of potential in farm team ballplayers partly because minor league baseball pays most players badly. Finlete’s first athlete Texas Rangers middle infield prospect Echedry Vargas signed with the club out of the Dominican Republic in 2022 for a $10000 bonus–the minimum at the time according to Connolly. Right now Vargas plays in A-ball where salaries max out at $27300. “He’s like a minimum wage guy … but outperforming players that signed for millions of dollars” the executive said.

Finlete is taking a crowd-funding approach selling shares in a Securities & Exchange Commission-registered offering to retail investors. Investors can buy shares in Vargas for $8 (with a 12-share minimum) with the player receiving a $500000 advance. In exchange investors get a claim of 10% of his baseball earnings for the next 25 years if he makes The Show or even if he ends up off-Broadway so to speak in the top pro leagues of Japan Korea and Taiwan according to the player agreement disclosed as part of the offering. If he fails to make the majors stateside or in Asia Vargas won’t owe anything. The offering is still raising money and has about $26000 in commitments according to the Finlete website.

The presence of smart money suggests there’s increasing traction with the idea of swapping a lump sum of cash now for a cut of athlete income later on. The current wave of start-ups was sparked by the initial success of Big League Advance a private fund that is best known for striking a deal with the now-superstar Fernando Tatis Jr. when he was a minor leaguer. Finlete joins the golf pro-focused Commonwealth Sports NFL player-backing Vestible and international soccer player investing Nordensa—which isn’t available to American investors—as more recent entrants to the budding scene.

Conscious of the other competitors in the space the company sees the carryover of the original Cameo-like idea as a key to drawing in fan investors; part of the pitch to athletes too is to build a cadre of supporters early. In Vargas’ case he commits to things such as signing 100 autographs annually and holding meet-and-greets with fans at games as perks to people buying a minimum number of shares and at least two 30-minute video-chat appearance annually under the deal.

“It’s like a PG version of OnlyFans” Connolly said. “You’re involved with the athlete on an intimate level. You get to be a part of the athlete’s journey you get to hear what they’re struggling with and what they’re working on.”

Such a relationship is also potentially lucrative for Finlete. If the current share offering in Vargas’ future income sells its maximum proposed level of $800000 (100000 shares) $300000 goes to cover the offering costs and reimbursements to Finlete. It’s not quite a fair comparison because certain costs aren’t proportional but a typical stock IPO sees about 5% of proceeds directed to expenses and commissions. Finlete also gets the right of first refusal to buy any future baseball-related income Vargas might consider selling.

“We want to do $100 million in revenue in two years. We want to create a trading platform that allows fans to buy and sell their positions … and have over 100 athletes on our platform from Nascar drivers to horse racing jockeys to baseball players and UFC fighters” Connolly said.

That’s a lot of hope riding on the shoulders of Vargas who is currently batting .227 for the Down East Wood Ducks of the Carolina League.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vMjQ3c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlL3V0YWgvYXJ0aWNsZS9taXJvLWxpdHRsZS10cmFuc2Zlci1wb3J0YWwtY29tbWl0bWVudC11dGFoLWJheWxvci1wZy10cmFuc2Zlci0tMjMxMzU1NDU3L9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vMjQ3c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlL3V0YWgvYXJ0aWNsZS9taXJvLWxpdHRsZS10cmFuc2Zlci1wb3J0YWwtY29tbWl0bWVudC11dGFoLWJheWxvci1wZy10cmFuc2Zlci0tMjMxMzU1NDU3L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BREAKING: Four-star transfer PG Miro Little has committed to Utah,"On Tuesday Craig Smith and the Runnin' Utes picked up a very valuable transfer portal addition after former Baylor guard and four-star transfer Miro Little announced his commitment to the program. This is a big recruiting win for the Runnin' Utes as they add a very promising young talent to the mix.

Little announced his commitment via Twitter:

As a 6-foot-4 185 pound guard Little shows the ability to do a bit of everything. He can be the primary ball handler he has a strong handle to go along with good feel for scoring opportunities for himself or others. He can score inside and out and can play off the ball as well. There are a lot of natural playmaking qualities that Little possesses and he's showcased good defensive ones as well. Despite the fact that he saw inconsistent playing time this past season he is still regarded as a four-star transfer prospect.

Utah brought Little in for an official visit this past weekend and were able to make a very good impression. Little is a native of Finland which gives the program valuable relationships in the form of Hanno Mottola Mikael Jantunen and even Lauri Markennan all of whom are connected through the Finland national team.

Little entered the portal after his first and only season with Baylor. The Bears had quite the logjam in the backcourt which led to him looking for a better opportunity elsewhere. Little still showcased his productive potential in games where he got extended playing time.

He is a former top 50 overall prospect and top 10 point guard in the 2023 recruiting class. He committed to Baylor over Indiana and Villanova while also having significant interest from other power programs in college basketball as well. Little earned a 94 four-star rating and No. 9 ranking in 247Sports' 2023 recruiting class.

Little did not play his ""senior year"" of high school at Sunrise Christian Academy but played for the Helsinki Basketball Academy (HBA) in Finland. HBA is a part of the Finland 1st Division basketball league and is essentially a high school program competing against professional players in Finland. Little averaged 21.6 points 9.0 rebounds and 5.8 assists in 20 games in this league during the 2021-22 season.

He joins Utah with three seasons of eligibility and a redshirt remaining. He is the fourth transfer addition and joins Keanu Dawes Mason Madsen and Zach Keller in Utah's transfer portal class. Utah now has five open spots remaining on the roster.

The report notably provided an update to PMI’s environmental social and governance (ESG) framework and strategy which was first launched in 2019. A major change is the separation of issues relating to products and issues related to business operations. There is also more clarity on ‘double materiality’ – the impact the business has externally and the impact that external factors have on the business – with more specific targets.

As a tobacco major PMI operates in an industry where the impact of operations is vastly outweighed by the impact of its upstream and/or downstream activities. It is the sort of company that many vocal critics of the current landscape of ESG metrics and funds would argue should based on its business model not be eligible for listing or inclusion. The tobacco industry is regarded as a ‘sin’ industry for many reasons. Chief among them is the impact of its product on consumer health but attention has also been drawn to cigarette butt pollution in marine environments; human rights abuses and deforestation in supply chains.

But should a business get ESG points for exiting the sector that results in these negative impacts upstream and downstream?

Even before Jennifer Motles was appointed as chief sustainability officer (CSO) at PMI in November 2020 taking the reins from Huub Savelkouls after his 25-year tenure at the business it had outlined a vision of a ‘smoke-free future’. This vision was built upon in March 2021 with a commitment for more than half of PMI’s total net revenues to come from smoke-free products and other smoke-free activities by 2025.

Enhancing ESG

The integrated report confirmed that 29.1% of PMI’s net revenues in 2021 derived from smoke-free products and that more than 99% of the business’s R&D expenditure last year went to smoke-free products. Alongside developing smoke-free products a key focus was scaling recycling for their end-of-life stage.

Speaking exclusively to edie Motles explains that the business conducted an updated materiality assessment in late 2021 partly because “the pace and scale of the smoke-free future transformation has accelerated radically”. She also says more broadly that “the world has changed a lot since 2019” due to the pandemic with the ‘Blue Planet 2 effect’ slowly fizzling out and with growing stakeholder awareness of issues relating to public health diversity and inclusion social equity and biodiversity.

“Any company that updates materiality should re-think their strategy and as materiality assessment is a dynamic process they should really be redefining and recalibrating based on which ESG issues are most material every few years” Motles summarises. Findings she argues should not simply be communicated in reports but used to inspire strategies which result – if necessary – in significant changes to product and service propositions.

This gap between reporting (ticking boxes) and changing strategies she believes is where many businesses get stuck and where much criticism of ESG stems from. This may be due to a lack of targeted understanding of current inputs and outputs compared to desired or required inputs and outputs due to the use of data that is not “robust meaningful or relevant” – or the use of ESG frameworks and ratings that encourage a tick-box approach.

The Financial Times has described the intense criticism that ESG frameworks ratings agencies and funds have come under this past year as a “reckoning”. Investors and members of the general public alike have questioned why good ratings and selection for thematic funds have been the reward for businesses implicated in issues like armed combat garment worker exploitation and fossil fuel pollution. There is also the persistent debate around whether ‘E’ ‘S’ and ‘G’ are being appropriately balanced – and whether carbon tunnel vision is preventing a holistic approach to the ‘E’.

“Being candid” Motles tells edie “traditional ESG metrics sometimes don’t cover significant problems your company is creating or your most material issues.

“Because ESG disclosures are so comprehensive you can tell many stories and in many cases avoid addressing the elephant in the room. For example tobacco companies can sit with you or report to you on what they claim is ESG. But it is all on decarbonisation without any mention of the most negative impact they create which is borne from the products they sell.

“When that is the case I think it’s very important that companies step in and commit to reporting not only against a set of metrics provided by standard-setters. In addition they should recognise that transformation is bespoke to each company’s value proposition and strategy and add further tailored metrics.”

The general consensus seems to be that 2022 presents an opportunity to improve ESG – standardising definitions and metrics and offering more transparency – rather than doing away with it altogether.

Embedded approach

Whether ESG frameworks are good bad or ugly using the findings of measurements to inform meaningful transformations of business models is a step few organisations have announced (other than PMI the case study that springs to mind is that of Orsted formerly Danish Oil and Natural Gas).

This is doubtless because transformation is no mean feat. Those in a stakeholder capitalist mindset will be loath to move away from a model that ultimately harms people and/or planet to some degree while it is still profitable (but they may wish to consider that 15 of the 17 S&P 500 firms that filed for bankruptcy between 2005 and 2015 recorded poor ESG credentials).

Once a business has stated an intention to transform there are all manner of challenges ranging from engagement with groups likely to be affected such as suppliers; to investment in new equipment infrastructure and business functions.

This is a stumbling block in some ‘sin industries’. An exposee published by Channel 4 News this week stated that collectively Europe’s four largest oil and gas companies are investing just 5% of their profits in clean energy.

With this in mind Motles’s team has worked with PMI’s financial team and other internal departments to draw up and report against a set of ‘transformation metrics’. These include changing where R&D expenditure is allocated; hiring more R&D experts; changing manufacturing lines; upskilling workers; launching new products and encouraging customers to change their habits.

The transformation metrics inform a ‘Business Transformation Financing Framework’. In short PMI is recognising that its ability to secure capital in the future will be dependent on its achieving its ‘smoke-free future’ vision so it is changing the way it issues financing instruments now. The metrics also inform KPIs which are linked to 30% of the remuneration for executives.

While an ever-increasing cohort of large businesses are linking ESG performance and top-level pay few have begun reporting against transformation metrics or similar. However the practice could well become prolific in the coming years in the UK with the phasing in of a net-zero transition mandate from 2023 beginning with the largest firms in the highest emitting sectors. Some firms have already produced these plans on a voluntary basis including Centrica and SSE but may need to update them once the Government finalizes requirements intended to ensure credibility.

And other nations may well follow the UK in this approach as they are doing regarding mandatory climate risk disclosures.

Motles believes there is also a role for voluntary action from businesses as regulatory approaches evolve. PMI has made its ESG KPI Protocol open-source in the hopes of assisting other businesses to implement a similar approach. She said she hopes that other firms will also share ideas and case studies to provide a better chance of “moving the needle” and noted that firms which do this must be open to feedback and discussion.

When asked whether she also sees the potential for a voluntary corporate collaboration on going beyond ESG tick-boxing like the Race to Zero for climate targets or EV100 for fleet electrification she said: “I think that creativity and ingenuity know no limits and that what you’re suggesting could be good.”

Crucially she concluded investors can prove just as effective at pushing companies to act as regulators or action from their peers can in some cases. “Investors need to become better informed about materiality so they don’t just approach this as a box-ticking exercise” Motles says. “They need to know what a good net-zero transition plan looks like for example or an effective diversity and inclusion approach. They need to consider business model transformation.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmljZS5nb3YvbmV3cy9yZWxlYXNlcy9pcHItY2VudGVyLWFubm91bmNlcy1yZWNpcGllbnRzLTIwMjAtcGFydG5lcnNoaXAtYXdhcmRzLWNvbWJhdGluZy1pbnRlbGxlY3R1YWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IPR Center announces recipients of 2020 Partnership Awards for combating intellectual property trade fraud crimes at ...,"WASHINGTON – The National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center (IPR Center) announced Thursday the recipients of its 2020 Partnership Awards during the inaugural private sector recognition ceremony at its northern Virginia headquarters.

The results confirm different elements of PMI’s IQOS research in confirming that it has a minimal effect on biological processes in people compared to smoking.

The lab researchers include those for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA); Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment; American Cancer Society; Japanese Department of Environmental Health’s National Institute of Public Health; China National Tobacco Quality Supervision and Test Centre; and even Ukraine’s leading research institutes — which conducted a six-month clinical study on IQOS that was published in prominent national medical periodical Ukrainian Health showing no significant adverse effect on users of smoke-free products — (Kvasha et al 2018).

In a statement PMI — which is one of biggest buyers of Malawi tobacco — says the many government bodies that conducted literature reviews or performed research on heated tobacco products found that they expose users to significantly lower levels of harmful chemicals.

On July 7 2020 the U.S. FDA issued decisions on modified risk tobacco product (MRTP) applications for IQOS and three HeatStick variants (the IQOS tobacco heating system) which PMI submitted in December 2016 and gave it a seal of approval.

In doing so the FDA found that the issuance of the modified risk tobacco product is appropriate to promote public health and is expected to benefit the health of the population as a whole.

In May 2020 the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) also published findings of its research on ‘A Method for Comparing the Impact of Carcinogenicity of Tobacco Products: A Case Study on Heated Tobacco Versus Cigarettes’ which RIVM developed as a method to estimate risk or assess the potential magnitude of the health impact between tobacco products.

The media statement further said in its publication RIVM assessed eight carcinogens to understand the likely health impact on individuals who switch to IQOS compared to those who continue smoking.

In the researchers’ conclusions they stated that — while IQOS is not risk-free — it is associated with 10 to 25 times lower exposure to these carcinogens and that this could translate into a substantially improved risk profile.

UK’s Public Health England (PHE) also published a review of the evidence on e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products and stated that heated tobacco products likely reduce users’ and bystanders’ exposure to harmful compounds compared to cigarettes.

PHE is also quoted as stressing that the available evidence suggests that heated tobacco products may be considerably less harmful than tobacco cigarettes.

The German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) published laboratory studies in Archives of Toxicology finding that reductions in selected toxicants measured by the institute “are likely to reduce toxicant exposure.”

Two media statement said government-commissioned studies were conducted by independent scientists in Russia confirming that IQOS aerosol contains an average of 90% reduced levels of harmful chemicals compared to cigarette smoke and that IQOS has a minimal effect on biological processes in people compared to smoking.

Meanwhile PMI — in its strong campaign for a smoke-free world hosted numerous media from across the world at its Swiss R&D Center in Neuchatel Switzerland on June 14 on the side lines of the Cube Technovation that brought together over 100 participants to explore a topic that is gaining prominence particularly as it relates to tobacco consumption.

The initiative was for the media to move along with campaigners in the dialogue around the importance of technology and innovation in creating a better future.

The media were appraised that innovation science and technology have long been leveraged to improve the world — whose examples include some advances that have become everyday basics in the lives of countless people around the world.

“These include refrigeration which has helped reduce foodborne illnesses as well as simple items such as seatbelts and airbags — which have dramatically improved road safety” said PMI in a statement.

Can innovation and technology apply to tobacco harm reduction? — “PMI firmly believes the answer is a resounding yes.

“The company has invested heavily in research and development to create new technologies and develop breakthrough products that are much better alternatives to continued smoking for adults who don’t quit tobacco and nicotine altogether and can play a role in addressing a global public health issue.

“Technovation provides media with an annual opportunity to engage with PMI’s senior leaders scientists and R&D experts. This year’s event focused on providing an immersive experience that demonstrated how disruptive science innovation and technology are driving the development of smoke-free products” said the statement.

It quoted Tommaso Di Giovanni Vice-president Global Communications at PMI as saying: “In 2016 PMI took a giant step by committing to focus our business on smoke-free products to replace cigarettes as soon as possible.

“We are seeking to radically reduce the harm caused by our products — not through reformulation but through reinvention and replacement.”

Many years ago continues the statement the tobacco industry was challenged to reduce the harm caused by cigarettes — and PMI accepted the challenge.

Since 2008 the company has invested more than US$9 billion in researching developing scientifically substantiating and commercializing non-combustible alternatives that are a far better choice than continued smoking.

“Science shows us that it’s the chemicals produced by combustion that are the primary cause of smoking-related diseases” the statement quoted Gizelle Baker Vice-president Global Scientific Engagement.

“If we want to achieve the public health breakthroughs that society demands and deserves we must follow the science.”

Stefano Volpetti PMI’s Chief Consumer Officer added credence saying: “We know that a single smoke-free product will not satisfy the preferences of all adult smokers.

“Therefore although not risk-free a portfolio of science-based smoke-free options — with different usage taste price and technology profiles — is necessary to encourage more smokers to switch completely.

“The more options that are available to smokers who don’t quit tobacco and nicotine altogether the more opportunities for them to choose an alternative and through switching to it completely abandon cigarettes.”

While it was only a time trial Kimmel’s new college coach could see that she was a bit thrown off while preparing to swim next to the Olympian.

“The only time I saw her even a little bit nervous was when she swam next to Katie” Rutgers women’s swimming and diving coach Jon Maccoll said.

The race itself a 200-meter IM time trial that Kimmel chose to participate in went as expected for any opponent of the highly-decorated Ledecky.

“She beat me like bad” Kimmel laughed.

However that moment came when it mattered least. The Fort Loudon Pa. native was able to remain focused throughout her primary events and during what she called “the most competitive meet I’ve ever been to.”

“Everybody there was like at peak performance but it was so awesome” Kimmel said. “I was I was really excited — I wouldn't say I was all that nervous.”

Kimmel placed No. 18 overall in the 100-meter breaststroke at the Phillips 66 National Championships finishing in second place of the C Final with a time of 1:09.80.

Her composure is something that’s already apparent to her new coach at Rutgers where she’s using her fifth year of eligibility and earning a master’s degree in communication after swimming for four years at St. Bonaventure.

“It's almost like she didn't know she was supposed to be nervous” Maccoll said of her performance at the national championships. ""The entire meet she was so confident.”

Where does Kimmel's confidence come from?

That confidence was something her former James Buchanan High School swim coach Lori Jo McCullough always thought she had. However Kimmel needed to translate it to the blocks after only beginning to swim competitively at 13 when her father encouraged her to pick a sport to participate in.

She swam for Mercersburg Area Swim Club before joining the high school team as a freshman while also running cross country. When McCullough joined the program as an assistant coach during her sophomore year in 2015 Kimmel started to rapidly drop her times.

“She was really the one to provide like the training and the technique to help get to a higher level of competition” Kimmel said of McCullough. ""She would break down our strokes like rebuild them. We'd work on every little small detail … She really got me a lot faster.”

McCullough swam at the collegiate level at the United States Naval Academy and quickly became the head swim coach at James Buchanan in 2016 coaching during Kimmel’s junior and senior seasons before leaving in 2018.

Under McCullough’s tutelage Kimmel began to make a lot of small adjustments and focus on mental training. After aiming and failing to break the 100-meter breaststroke record her freshman year Kimmel swam a 1:11 during her sophomore year to take the record finally improving on a time that had plateaued.

“It was sort of that first time that all of her work and dedication really paid off with that little bit of time drop” McCullough said. ""She was just so happy. You could tell that she got it like you could tell that swimming has sort of become part of her.”

By the end of her junior year she dropped seven seconds and eventually finished her high school career with a time of 1:03.04 in the event.

Kimmel still holds records at James Buchanan for the 100-meter breaststroke 200-meter freestyle 500-meter freestyle and 200-meter IM according to Swimcloud.

“It's very unusual even for elite athletes to be able to make some of the modifications that she was able to make” McCullough said. ""It's definitely one of her strengths for sure. Combine that with her most excellent work ethic and her competitive drive her success was pretty inevitable.”

Those attributes and her new lower times made Kimmel appealing to many college programs specifically in the 100-meter breaststroke a technique which she felt always came somewhat naturally to her.

Kimmel did pick to attend a college outside of Pennsylvania but stayed close to her small-town roots with her choice of St. Bonaventure. She committed to the university of only 2500 students on her 18th birthday and majored in journalism and mass communications.

McCullough helped Kimmel through that college process and the swimmer gives her high school coach a lot of credit for the level she’s competing at now.

“I give her so much credit for where I am today” Kimmel said. “She was the coach that really made me good at swimming. Like really made me the swimmer I am.”

Kimmel quickly found success with the Bonnies breaking the school’s 100-meter and 200-meter breaststroke record while earning a bronze medal at the 2019 Atlantic 10 Swimming and Diving Championships during her freshman season.

She broke both records again during her sophomore year winning silver medals in both events at the 2020 Atlantic 10 Swimming and Diving Championships. She ended her junior season with a gold medal in the 2021 Atlantic 10 championships and another record in the 100-meter breaststroke while earning another silver medal in the 200-meter version of the event.

Kimmel came just .01 seconds from tying her own program record in the 100-meter breaststroke during the Atlantic 10 championships during her senior year capping off her career at St. Bonaventure with a silver medal in the event her seventh individual medal overall.

With her fifth year of eligibility available due to the extra season given to NCAA athletes because of the COVID-19 pandemic Kimmel wanted to swim but wasn’t sure where she wanted to go. While she said that staying at St. Bonaventure was an appealing choice she chose to transfer to Rutgers.

What will Kimmel be doing at Rutgers?

The Pennsylvania native will have a chance to make an immediate impact with the Scarlet Knights as her current personal best in the 100-meter breaststroke would break the school record. Kimmel has also had extra time to bed in with her new program on Rutgers’ club team this summer practicing with her new teammates and coaches.

“It was all within a week I graduated and then a week later I moved here” Kimmel said. ""It was a little hard at first. I was a little I guess homesick for St. Bonaventure. Like this is a huge campus. It's like in a much more populated area; that was an adjustment.”

Despite the changes Kimmel doesn’t regret her choice.

“I'm really happy that I went here though it was really perfect” Kimmel said. “I've swam this whole summer here and I love it. I love the girls I've met so far my coaches are really great they know so much and it's become a much higher level of training.”

The swimmer joins a more competitive Big Ten conference where her personal bests would have placed 12th and 13th in the 100-meter breaststroke and 200-meter breaststroke at the 2022 Big Ten Championships respectively. She was able to earn medals in the Atlantic 10 with those times throughout her St. Bonaventure career.

However Kimmel's performance at the Phillips 66 National Championships was encouraging beating out some of the competition she’ll face in her new conference. She has goals of Big Ten meet success and an NCAA meet appearance and with her ability to apply herself her new coach feels like she’ll be able to make a splash for a Rutgers team on the up.

“Her work ethic is like nothing I've ever seen” Maccoll said. “I've never seen her take a rep off ever in four months. Never one time have I seen her go half effort on anything. I told her that the other day I said ‘Never change Rachel.’”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA4LzI0L3doYXQtZG9lcy1vY2NpZGVudGFsLXBldHJvbGV1bS1oYXZlLXRoYXQtY29ub2NvcGhpL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Does Occidental Petroleum Have That ConocoPhillips Doesn't?,"Warren Buffett's favorite oil stock is looking toward the future of energy.

Oil giant Occidental Petroleum (OXY -1.13%) has caught the eye of Warren Buffett. His company Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.84%) (BRK.B 0.67%) has already purchased a more than 20% stake in Occidental. Meanwhile it recently received regulatory approval to buy up to half of the oil company's outstanding shares.

Occidental isn't Buffett's first foray into the oil patch. He once held a sizable position in ConocoPhillips (COP -0.71%). However instead of going back to the well and buying an oil company he already knew quite well Buffett has opted for Occidental this time around to play the boom in oil prices. Here's a look at what it has that's missing at ConocoPhillips.

A head-to-head comparison

ConocoPhillips is one of the world's largest exploration and production (E&P) companies based on output and reserves. It operates in 13 countries and has a diversified asset portfolio. It produced an average of 1.72 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/D) in the second quarter.

Occidental Petroleum is also an international energy company with assets in the U.S. the Middle East and North Africa. It's one of the largest producers in the U.S. with leading positions in the Permian and DJ Basins and the offshore Gulf of Mexico. It produced 1.15 million BOE/D during the second quarter. Occidental also has a midstream and marketing segment and a chemicals subsidiary. The company also formed a low carbon ventures unit to advance leading-edge technologies to grow its business and reduce emissions.

The missing pieces

The big difference is that Occidental Petroleum has more business diversity. ConocoPhillips used to be an integrated energy company. However it spun off its refining midstream marketing and chemicals assets into Phillips 66 in 2012 to focus on growing its E&P business. Now its fortunes rise and fall with oil and gas prices.

While Occidental Petroleum isn't a truly integrated oil company since it doesn't own refining assets it does capture more of the energy value chain than ConocoPhillips. Its midstream segment provides flow assurance for its volumes and helps maximize the value of its oil and gas. Meanwhile its chemicals subsidiary uses products derived from oil and gas to create higher-valued products. These operations also provide Occidental with lower volatile earnings that can help mute some of the sting from oil price volatility.

Another major differentiator is Occidental's low carbon ventures subsidiary. The company formed the dedicated business unit in 2018 and has made several investments to develop and commercialize carbon capture and storage technology develop new products derived from captured carbon and reduce its carbon emissions profile. As part of its investments the company formed 1PointFive to commercialize and deploy large-scale direct air capture (DAC) technology. Occidental is investing upwards of $1 billion to build a large-scale DAC system in the Permian Basin.

Occidental sees enormous market potential in carbon capture. The company estimates it could eventually become a $3 trillion to $5 trillion global market. Furthermore the company believes it could generate a similar amount of earnings and cash flow from carbon capture as it currently does from producing oil and gas. It has already started to monetize its investment. Airbus purchased 400000 tons of carbon removal credits with the option for more in the future. Occidental also agreed to sell 200000 barrels of net zero oil per year to SK Trading International.

While ConocoPhillips is making investments to reduce its emissions and develop future low-carbon energy businesses including carbon capture and hydrogen it's not as far along as Occidental and it could fall behind Occidental which is emerging as a leader in carbon capture.

Buffett's bet on Occidental appears to be on more than oil prices

Warren Buffett could have picked any oil stock to make a wager on higher oil prices including going back to the well with ConocoPhillips. Instead he selected Occidental Petroleum which offers upside to crude prices and the future of the energy market via its carbon capture investments. That makes it stand out as a potentially better option for investors seeking exposure to the upside of oil prices from a company with a more visible path to sustainability.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9kZW52ZXIvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA4LzI0L29mZmVuLXBldHJvbGV1bS1nLXMtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24tY29sb3JhZG8tZ2FzLWZ1ZWwuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fuel company strikes another deal to grow in Colorado - Denver Business Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2022/08/24/offen-petroleum-g-s-acquisition-colorado-gas-fuel.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9kZW52ZXIvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA4LzI0L29mZmVuLXBldHJvbGV1bS1nLXMtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24tY29sb3JhZG8tZ2FzLWZ1ZWwuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

(Photo by Greg Nash – Pool/Getty Images)

Republican members of Congress who voted against certifying 2020 presidential election results received over $22.2 million from corporate PACs between Jan. 7 2021 and June 30 2022 a new OpenSecrets analysis found.

The 147 election objectors in the Senate and House members voted against certification of President Joe Biden’s victory in Arizona or Pennsylvania amid a violent attack on the Capitol that injured police officers forced lawmakers to evacuate and left at least seven people dead.

Three members of what critics dubbed the “Sedition Caucus” have since left Congress and 122 are running for office in 2022. According to filings with the FEC six Republican incumbents lost their primaries – three in the House and and three in the Senate.

In the wake of the Jan. 6 attack scores of private companies declared they would completely stop pause or reevaluate PAC giving to election objectors. But several corporations resumed PAC giving to these lawmakers within a month of the attack.

Koch Industries’ PAC was the largest corporate PAC contributor to members of Congress who voted against election certification with more than $607000 disbursed to campaigns or leadership PACs. Home Depot Boeing Co. and United Parcel Service closely follow with more than $500000 each in corporate PAC contributions.

More election objectors – 52 – received funds from Koch Industries’ PAC than any other corporate PAC. Home Depot PAC is a close second donating about $593000 to 44 members. Boeing Co. follows with $520000 to 27 members.

Sara Gorman Home Depot’s senior director of corporate communications told OpenSecrets that the company’s PAC supports candidates on both sides of the aisle who champion pro-business pro-retail positions that create jobs and economic growth. “It’s pretty evenly split” Gorman said adding that the PAC is also one of the largest donors to members of the New Democrat Caucus and the Congressional Black Caucus.

Boeing President and CEO David Calhoun issued a statement promoting the spirit of bipartisanship and the peaceful transition of government shortly after the Jan. 6 attack.

A media relations spokesperson for Boeing declined to comment further. Koch Industries and United Parcel Service did not respond to OpenSecrets’ request for comment.

Senators in the “Sedition Caucus”

While dozens of Senators announced their intention to vote against certification just eight Senators – all Republicans – followed through after the violent attack on the Capitol. But several House members who objected to certification are now running for Senate seats and the small group of senators who objected to certification of 2020 election results are also some of the top recipients of corporate PAC funds.

Sen. John Kennedy Louisiana’s incumbent senator since 2016 received more corporate PAC money since the Jan. 6 attack than any other election objector. The Cook Political Report rates his seat solidly Republican.

His campaign took more than $334000 from corporate PACs and his leadership PAC received about $70000 more. The corporate PACs of Koch Industries and Capital One contributed the highest amounts of $20000 each to him. Home Depot’s and Charter Communications’ corporate PACs contributed $15000 while Valero Energy’s PAC gave $12500.

Kennedy voted against the conviction of former President Donald Trump during the Senate’s impeachment trial and questioned 2020 election results reportedly sending an email in December 2020 that claimed there was an excessiveness of “tomfoolery” and “a few too many shenanigans.”

In January 2021 Kennedy released a joint statement claiming that the presidential election was “rife with allegations of fraud and irregularities that exceed any in our lifetimes.”

Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wis.) received the second highest amount of $167000 in corporate PAC contributions since rioters stormed the Capitol. She called Trump’s second impeachment inquiry “political theater” and later wrote a letter challenging the legitimacy of Biden’s 2020 victory.

Despite her misgivings about the election results Lummis condemned the Jan. 6 incident in a public statement.

“I have serious concerns about election integrity” her statement read. “But today’s sickening un-American attack on the Capitol overshadowed that debate.”

PricewaterhouseCoopers’ PAC contributed $14000 in total to Lummis’ campaign and leadership PAC making it her top PAC contributor. Other contributors to Lummis include corporate PACs affiliated with Koch Industries Rock Holdings Pinnacle West Capital Burns & McDonnell and UBS AG.

Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) received $133500 from the corporate PACs of Southern Co United Parcel Service Maynard Cooper & Gale Drummond Co. and Torch Technologies. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) who called Trump’s impeachment trial “a complete waste of time” received the same amount from several other corporate PACs including Koch Industries Home Depot Apollo Global Management and NextEra Energy among others.

On Nov. 5 2020 when the presidential election votes were still being counted Tuberville tweeted that the election results were “out of control.” Before he was even sworn in as senator Tuberville objected to congressional certification of the presidential election.

Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) received close to $120000 from the corporate PACs of companies including Southern Co. and General Atomics among others.

To justify her opposition to the Electoral College results Hyde-Smith claimed she heard from many Mississippians “troubled” by conduct during the election and its results. Following Trump’s acquittal she released another statement announcing her support on the vote to acquit the former president.

“His speech on Jan. 6 neither implicitly nor explicitly encouraged the use of violence or lawless action” the statement read.

Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) who opposed the impeachment of Trump and claimed voting irregularities marred the 2020 presidential election received a total of $108000 in contributions from corporate PACs between the Jan. 6 attack and June 30 2022. Marshall’s donors include corporate PACs affiliated with companies such as Koch Industries Home Depot Pfizer Inc. and United Health Group.

Pfizer swore off donating any of the 147 election objectors for at least six months following the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. But OpenSecrets data shows the company gave $2500 to the Lone Star Leadership PAC connected to Rep. Michael Burgess (R-Texas) the week following the Jan. 6 attack. Keep America Rolling PAC connected to Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.) received another $2500 from Pfizer in February 2021.

Two senators who voted against certification Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) swore off corporate PAC contributions after corporations’ exodus from political giving to election objectors.

Despite his pledge Cruz reported $31500 in corporate PAC contributions since the Jan. 6 attack with most of that going to his leadership PACs. His funders include the corporate PACs of companies including Boeing Co Community Bancshares of Mississippi Brownstein Hyatt et al Apache Corp and TC Energy. Since losing to Trump in the 2016 presidential primaries Cruz has been considered one of the most loyal allies of the former president casting doubt on 2020 election results and spreading disproven claims of election fraud.

Hawley received $5000 each from Community Bancshares of Mississippi and Marathon Petroleum’s PACs. But OpenSecrets’ data show that the money was returned between the Jan. 6 attack and June 30 2022.

According to reporting by the Washington Post a Marathon Petroleum spokesperson said that the company condemned the “appalling” and “unequivocal” violence of Jan. 6. It led to a decision to suspend political donations to election objectors although a resumption date was not specified.

Corporate PAC money in the House

Corporate PACs steered more than $19.7 million to 139 U.S. House members who voted against certification of the 2020 presidential election between the Jan. 6 attack and June 30 2022.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) was the biggest benefactor of corporate cash among House election objectors during that period.

McCarthy has echoed Trump’s false claims questioning 2020 election results and opposed the formation of the bipartisan commission for investigating the Jan. 6 attack. Nevertheless McCarthy’s campaign and leadership PAC received a total of $921400 from the corporate PACs of 14 companies including Wells Fargo Blue Cross/Blue Shield and Comcast.

Reps. Ken Calvert (R-Calif.) Sam Graves (R-Mo.) Richard Hudson (R-N.C.) Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) and Steve Scalise (R-La.) and Sen. Blaine Luetkemeyer (R-Mo.) each amassed more than $519000 from corporate PAC donors since the Jan. 6 attack. Luetkemeyer crossed the $600000 mark and Scalise received over $700000.

Accountable U.S. – a nonpartisan watchdog group – zeroed in corporate PAC contributions from Fortune 500 companies and trade groups that issued public statements on the Jan. 6 attack. At least 77 PACs affiliated with those companies or trade groups gave to one or more election objector.

The American Bankers Association PAC contributed over $501000 to 107 election objectors. An association spokesperson told Insider that the Jan. 6 attack “an assault on our democracy” and promised to review its political activities adding the “troubling events” would be a point of consideration.

The bankers association PAC gave Rep. Michael Guest (R-Miss.) more than any other election objector with $10500 between the Jan. 6 attack and June 30 of this year. Guest was one among 126 signers of the amicus brief filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) in a lawsuit that sought to impede the Electoral College vote. Guest also co-sponsored a bill that challenged the integrity of mail-in voting in December 2020.

Guest received another $74500 in PAC contributions from corporate PACs affiliated with companies including Southern Co. Raytheon Technologies Huntington Ingalls Industries Nucor Corp and Mississippi ACRE according to OpenSecrets data. Facing reelection in 2022 Guest won the GOP primary runoff in the race to keep his House seat with over 67% vote.

Election objectors who received PAC contributions but are no longer in office include Reps. Jackie Walorski (R-Ind.) Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) and Jim Hagedorn (R-Minn.). They collectively received $525000 from the corporate PACs of companies including Home Depot Blue Cross/Blue Shield Koch Industries PricewaterhouseCoopers Exxon Mobil and Rolls-Royce PLC.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy4xMDExbm93LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzI0L25lYXJseS1kZWNhZGUtbGF0ZXItc3Rha2Vob2xkZXJzLXNheS1waW5uYWNsZS1iYW5rLWFyZW5hLWlzLXNtYXNoaW5nLXN1Y2Nlc3MtZGVidC1zdGlsbC1sb29tcy_SAZABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuMTAxMW5vdy5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8yNC9uZWFybHktZGVjYWRlLWxhdGVyLXN0YWtlaG9sZGVycy1zYXktcGlubmFjbGUtYmFuay1hcmVuYS1pcy1zbWFzaGluZy1zdWNjZXNzLWRlYnQtc3RpbGwtbG9vbXMvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nearly a decade later stakeholders say Pinnacle Bank Arena is smashing success but debt still looms,"LINCOLN Neb. (KOLN) - For nine years the Pinnacle Bank Arena has been a destination in Lincoln.

“The Pinnacle Bank Arena has been an amazing project” Tom Lorenz PBA Manager said.

The arena has hosted some of music’s biggest names set the stage for graduates and transformed into a mass vaccination site to combat COVID-19.

“I personally think it’s lived up to every expectation and more” Jeff Maul executive director for the Lincoln Convention and Visitors Bureau said.

Lorenz said except for the COVID years PBA has had about 750000 visitors a year sold 1.5 million tickets and brought in more than $100 million in revenue from ticket sales alone.

“We certainly had large expectations and I think it’s met all of those expectations and exceeded them” Lorenz said. Not just us but the economic impact its had in the area with the growth in the Railyard and the Haymarket.”

But the city and tax payers are still footing the bill and will be for at least two decades.

In 2010 56% of voters approved the creation of the West Haymarket Joint Public Agency which allowed the city to take out $300 million in bonds and use a new occupation tax on businesses like restaurants bars and hotels to pay off the debt.

On top of building the arena the JPA paid for moving BNSF Railroad tracks paving the way for privately funded hotels the Railyard and more.

“I’m really pleased with how the project has turned out” Dan Marvin Urban Development Director for the City of Lincoln said. “We’ve probably accomplished more than what we even told voters we could.”

The occupation tax is also bringing in far more than projected. A chart provided by the city shows in 2021 the tax brought in about $15 million and is projected to bring in just under $20 million in 2022. The city finance director said they didn’t think they’d bring in $20 million in a year until 2036. So far the tax has gone toward paying off $191.4 million of the debt but an additional $504 million has to be paid by 2024. That includes nearly $200 million in interest.

This chart provided by the city finance office shows revenue from the occupation tax is bringing in significantly more than projected. (City of Lincoln)

“Any time you ask the tax payers to dole out additional dollars from their bottom line revenues that’s a hard adjustment. It’s a hard change” Maul said. “But I think the economic impact this has had on all of us; It’s increased sales tax revenues for the city it’s increased lodging tax revenues it’s bringing in new visitors to our community.”

10/11 NOW was unable to obtain an official economic impact study done on Pinnacle Bank Arena but did request data showing the amount of sales tax and lodging tax brought in over the last decade. On average since 2013 the amount the city is collecting from sales taxes has risen 5 percent annually. The amount of lodging taxes collected by the city has on average risen 10 percent each year since the arena opened. Though neither the city nor county would tie those increases to the Pinnacle Bank Arena entirely.

But stakeholders say it’s paying off and that Pinnacle Bank Arena will continue to bring in crowds re-invent itself and re-invent Lincoln.

“It’s created a sea change that has ripple effects in the skyscraper you see in that area the other development in the Haymarket the housing that’s come in” Marvin said. “Much of that is a result of the Pinnacle Bank Arena transforming the entire downtown.”

Here's why you shouldn't wait to talk to a lender,"Most people begin their homebuying journey once they've saved up enough money for a down payment. The rest of the process typically entails speaking to a lender getting pre-approved for a home loan working with a real estate agent to find a place that's right for you making an offer conducting inspections and eventually closing on the property. According to Nicole Rueth senior vice president at the Fairway Independent Mortgage Corporation potential homebuyers should start speaking to lenders long before they're ready to buy a home instead of waiting until they have enough money to make a down payment. ""The moment you think about buying a home is when you should be talking to a lender"" Rueth says. ""You don't have to already be in the process of buying a home to do this. You can be two years away from buying a home and still start that conversation.""

By having that conversation early on — even if you're still a few years away from buying a home — you'll be able to get your lender's input on what you'll need to do over the next few years to afford the kind of house you want to buy. ""Maybe you find that you'll need to get a higher paying job to afford the house or maybe you're told you need to work on paying down more of your debts or fight off a negative trade line on your credit report"" Rueth explains. ""This will be the homework you have to work on after your meeting with a lender."" Working with a lender ahead of time can also provide a clearer picture as to what else you'll need to budget for — after all a down payment is just one of several upfront costs you'll need to be prepared to pay when you're finally ready to buy a home. For instance you'll need to account for lender fees — charges associated with processing approving and funding your loan which can wind up being 1% to 2% of your loan amount — as well as additional fees for appraisal inspection and title insurance.

How to find a mortgage lender

Rueth recommends starting with the people and institutions you trust when trying to find a lender. ""I would check in with the people you trust. Don't just ask your friends who they got their mortgage from ask your financially savvy friends who they went with"" Rueth says. ""You want to take advice from the right people."" Another good place to get the homeowner conversation started is your favorite local bank. Rueth suggests working with a lender that already provides resources to instruct and inform potential borrowers about the homebuying process which shows they believe in spending the time to educate others. A quick search on a mortgage lender's website can help you learn what kinds of educational resources are offered. Chase Bank has a great podcast series called ""Beginner to Buyer"" that's aimed at helping customers familiarize themselves with the homebuying process while PNC Bank has an online first-time homebuyer's guide which includes access to an online affordability calculator. You can also do research on your own with the help of websites that cover mortgage lenders. Select has rounded up and ranked the best mortgage providers for a number of situations including the best mortgages for those who want to make a small down payment to the best mortgages for those with a low credit score. ""A good lender will spend the time with you even if you're not ready to buy a home today"" Rueth explains. ""The conversation today will better position you down the line to reach that goal of homeownership.""

Bottom line

Even if you're a couple of years away from being ready to buy a home it can still be beneficial to sit down with a lender and talk things out. The conversation can help you figure out what the next 12 to 24 months should look like in terms of getting financially ready to buy a place. ""Anyone who doesn't think they can purchase a home right now needs to figure out the path to ownership"" Rueth says. ""It's never a 'no' but it may just be a 'not right now.'"" In other words early conversations with a lender can help you close the gap between ""not right now"" and owning a home.

The restaurant will be built on Wegmans Drive east of PNC Bank.

The one-story 2554-square-foot building will have a drive-through lane and patio. An adjacent parking lot will accommodate 25 vehicles.

Closing in September:Erie Quaker Steak & Lube

Starbucks did not respond to a Times-News query on when construction might begin and when the new store might open.

The development plan for the project was prepared by KU Resources of Duquesne Pennsylvania and was approved by Millcreek Township supervisors on Tuesday. The Millcreek Township Planning Commission recommended the plan for supervisors' approval on Aug. 2.

The plan leaves room for another development between PNC and Starbucks. No plan for that parcel has yet been submitted to the township officials said.

The new Starbucks will be the fifth in the Erie area. There are two locations in Millcreek in the Millcreek Plaza near the Millcreek Mall and at 2205 W. 12th St. and two in Summit Township at 6801 Peach St. and in the Target store at 6700 Peach St.

Starbucks coffee also is sold at other retail outlets including the cafe in the Barnes & Noble store at 5909 Peach St. in Millcreek.

Boatload of new choices:New and improved restaurant choices on Erie's bayfront

Starbucks closed a downtown Erie location at 502 State St. in December. The store was one of 400 that Starbucks announced it would close between June 2020 and December 2021 as it rolled out a new format and made other changes.

Leaving location:Downtown Erie Starbucks closure is permanent

The Seattle-based chain now operates 34630 locations worldwide according to its website.

Grounded in coffee sales Starbucks also sells a variety of hot and cold beverages breakfast and lunch foods bakery items snacks oatmeal and yogurt.

The Australian Government announced its intention to establish a reinsurance pool covering the risk of property damage caused by cyclone and cyclone-related-flood damage In May of 2021.

In April this year the APRA stated its intention to allow insurers to fully recognise the risk transfer provided by the reinsurance pool in recognition of the Australian Government guarantee of the ARPC and proposed consequential updates to the prudential framework.

On the 16th of June this year the APRA proposed changes to six general insurance reporting standards that incorporate APRA’s clarification of the treatment of reinsurance recoverables from the ARPC.

APRA proposed that this change be made in the following reporting standards:

• Reporting Standard GRS 114.1 Assets by Counterparty Grade

• Reporting Standard GRS 114.1.G Assets by Counterparty Grade

• Reporting Standard GRS 114.3 Off-balance Sheet Business

• Reporting Standard GRS 114.3.G Off-balance Sheet Business

• Reporting Standard GRS 117.0 Asset Concentration Risk Charge

• Reporting Standard GRS 117.0.G Asset Concentration Risk Charge

No submissions were received in response to APRA’s consultation package which closed on the 30th of June 2022.

The APRA has finalised the amendments and has incorporated them into the relevant reporting standards as proposed. The changes are set to take effect for reporting periods ending on or after the 1st of July 2022.

Quarterly data submissions for this period will be due by the 28th of October for Northern Territory Victoria Tasmania and Western Australia; and by the 31st of October for New South Wales the Australian Capital Territory Queensland and South Australia.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbGl0YXJ5LmNvbS9taWxpdGFyeS1maXRuZXNzL2Fzay1zdGV3LWhvdy1wcmVwYXJlLWhhbmRsZS1wc3QtcnVsZS1jaGFuZ2Vz0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWlsaXRhcnkuY29tL21pbGl0YXJ5LWZpdG5lc3MvYXNrLXN0ZXctaG93LXByZXBhcmUtaGFuZGxlLXBzdC1ydWxlLWNoYW5nZXM_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ask Stew: How to Prepare to Handle PST Rule Changes,"Be prepared for surprise rule changes on any Physical Screening Test (PST) event because instructors will often institute what appears to be an arbitrary rule just to see how students handle the disruption.

For the Navy PST the first event is the 500-yard swim using an underwater recovery stroke like the breaststroke side stroke or combat swimmer stroke (CSS). Next you will do push-ups sit-ups pull-ups and a 1.5-mile run. Depending on the testing location and its facilities there may be changes to the PST.

Here is a question that prompted me to discuss examples of changes to some of the written rules of the test and why instructors make these changes.

Stew I saw a CSS video where the swimmer stays on one side the entire 500-yard PST swim test. Is this just in a timed 500-yard swim for the PST? Should we be alternating sides in practice? Thanks.

You can stay on one side or alternate strong and weak sides when doing a side stroke or CSS-type swim. The CSS is just a modified side stroke with a cool nickname so there are two sides you can choose for your swim.

For a 500-yard swim it doesn't really matter as you should only be swimming for 8-9 minutes. Some pools may be 25 yards or 50 yards. Some may be 25 meters or 50 meters. Knowing the difference matters since 450 meters = nearly 500 yards.

There may be some rules from the instructor grading the PST swim. If they say you have to be facing them during the entire test you must change strong and weak sides every length of the pool. Regardless you should learn both sides of the stroke as you may need it someday.

Other rules during the swim can be the following: No goggles or mask no breaststroke pullout off the wall or you must call out your name and lap number every lap. These are common rules during a PST but you won't see them every single time.

Switching sides regularly really does matter when you swim with big scuba fins for multiple miles. At SEAL training you will swim 4000 yards (two nautical miles) with fins every week in the ocean. Switching sides every 5-10 minutes is wise since your legs and top arm pull may need a ""break"" from that movement especially when it takes 65-80 minutes to swim that far in open ocean.

Push-up Rules

Push-up testing varies as well. Graders will count repetitions when the chest touches the ground a flat hand under your chest or even a closed fist. Some will require a 90-degree angle bend in the down position and a zero-degree bend (straight arm) in the up position. There have been students who quit in the middle of a push-up test when these rule changes appear for the first time.

In a course of instruction where there is a high attrition rate (like SEAL training) instructors want to make sure you can handle negative feedback and changes to procedure without losing your composure.

Sit-up Rules

The rules often say that shoulder blades touch the ground in the down position arms stay crossed and hands touch your collarbones with elbows touching the knees in the up position. Getting called for a ""no-count rep"" is common if your hands leave your collarbones or your shoulder blades do not touch the ground.

Usually small changes to this event do not change the test that much. Having someone hold your feet with their hands or sit on them during the two-minute test can be a rule change some are not prepared to handle.

Pull-up Rules

The rules usually require a straight dead hang (arms straight) in the down position and chin over the bar for the up position to count as a full repetition. However the cadence of the first eight repetitions can throw off first-time PST takers so be prepared for the first reps to the minimum standard to be on the instructor's count of ""up/down.""

1.5-Mile Timed Run

The rules here are minimal but the locations where you run the 1.5 miles can vary. If you have a track you are lucky. Some courses are smaller tracks or two three-quarter-mile straightaways with a turn around on ground that can be dirt concrete or pavement.

Just be prepared to run your 1.5 miles at the pace you have practiced regardless of the type of venue used to test this event.

If you don't want to be bothered by any subtle rule change or different type of venue from pool size to the ground you run on you need to practice this test many times on your own. In fact my No. 1 recommendation is do not even talk to a recruiter until you know (because you have prepared and self-tested) that you can crush any fitness test you must take to join any branch of the military. For jobs like special ops that require a higher level of physical performance you can ruin your chances if you do not follow this advice.

The semiconductor giant said in the press release that this agreement will increase the company’s pool of capital for manufacturing build-outs and accelerate its IDM 2.0 strategy. This agreement will see Intel provide 51 per cent of the funds for its Ocotillo campus in Chandler Arizona with Brookfield supplying the other 49 per cent. More importantly this agreement sets a precedent for Intel to replicate the model with future partners.

The transaction with Brookfield is expected to close by the end of 2022. Over the next three years Intel expects the agreement to provide a US$15 billion cumulative benefit to Intel’s adjusted free cash flow.

This agreement which the company has dubbed the Semiconductor Co-investment Program (SCIP) represents a first for Intel. The company described the method as a key element of its Smart Capital Approach that sources funds from a multitude of channels.

But the Smart Capital Approach encompasses more than building partnerships. Its blueprint also entails increasing capacity investments garnering government incentives enhancing its new Intel Foundry service and working with external foundries.

Reviving domestic production

According to the Semiconductor Industry Association the share of modern semiconductor production in the U.S. has decreased from 37 per cent in 1990 to just 12 per cent in 2022. This loss was partially attributed to the low level of investments from the government. As tension builds between the world’s powers and the chip shortage is still hammering industries securing the semiconductor supply chain has become a priority for all nations.

Responding to the urgency the U.S. government announced the CHIPS and Science Act in 2022 which promised US$52 billion in subsidies for its semiconductor industry. Following the CHIPS Act the government also introduced the Facilitating American-Built Semiconductors (FABS) Act which proposes a 25 per cent semiconductor investment tax credit that includes investment in the tooling required for manufacturing. Its name is also in reference to semiconductor fabrication plants commonly called fabs.

Intel itself has been making a slew of investments. In January the company announced plans to build a US$100 billion fab complex consisting of eight chip factories in Albany Ohio calling it the largest private sector investment ever made in the state. Additionally the company has committed US$89 billion to build semiconductor production and research facilities in Germany France Ireland Poland and Spain.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2NhbmFkYS9lZG1vbnRvbi9jaXR5LWNvdW5jaWwtc2NvbmEtcG9vbC0xLjY1NjE0NDTSASBodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYmMuY2EvYW1wLzEuNjU2MTQ0NA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Edmonton city councillors vote to pull the plug on 65-year-old Scona Pool over safety issues,"The 65-year-old Scona Pool in Old Strathcona is set to close for good after Edmonton city councillors were told Wednesday that the building is a safety risk to the public.

City managers told council's executive committee that the facility has significant structural damage and would cost at least $6 million to repair and keep open for another five years.

An assessment of the building completed in July revealed a cracked wall and problems with the roof foundation and heater in the building.

Councillors voted to accept administration's recommendation to close the pool.

Anne Stevenson Ward O-day'min councillor expressed regret in having to make the decision.

""Unfortunately I think this is an example where we are not able to sustainably continue investing in this facility"" Stevenson said.

""As difficult as this is I do think part of transforming our city part of building toward the future we want to see is not only about starting some things but stopping others.""

Adam Laughlin the city's manager of integrated infrastructure services noted the pool was initially slated to close in 2015.

""It's been significant investment in this facility to keep it going"" Laughlin told the committee.

""Throughout those seven years we have regularly checked in on the facility to confirm the condition and if this was just a heat exchanger issue we wouldn't be having a report in front of council.""

City managers said Wednesday that Scona Pool has significant structural damage and would cost at least $6 million to repair and keep open for another five years. (Scott Neufeld/CBC)

The facility's operator River City Recreation Inc. had insisted the only problem was with the heater that broke down in June and which could be replaced for $40000.

Michelle Plouffe the city's legal counsel also advised councillors about the status of the pool.

""I can say very clearly that the risk of injury and the risk to the city is very high"" Plouffe said.

Laughlin said the city's community services will work with pool users to find alternative places at city and non-city facilities.

Swimmers and community members had lobbied the city to keep the pool open until the replacement Rollie Miles Recreation Centre is closer to being built.

That's estimated to be years away although Mayor Amarjeet Sohi said he's going to push to expedite funding for the new facility at this fall's budget session.

""Sorry to disappoint many people but I think the responsible thing to do both physically as well as looking into the future is to make that decision and put that $6 million into further design work that needs to be done on Rollie Miles"" Sohi said.

Great memories

Members of the Strathcona High School swim team and community leaders joined the meeting earlier to make the case to keep the pool open.

Isabella Hernandez a captain of the school's swim team told councillors how much the pool means to her and her friends.

""I've made some great memories there and I don't want them to be torn down and forgotten about it's like when you live in a house for so long and it burns down and all those memories and moments are gone"" she said.

Several other community groups including synchronized swimming clubs and paddling clubs use the pool.

The city must give the operator 30 days' notice before it closes the building.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9jaXRpZXMvbXVtYmFpL211bWJhaS1ibWMtc3dpbW1pbmctcG9vbHMtbWVtYmVyc2hpcC1vbmxpbmUtcmVnaXN0cmF0aW9uLTgxMDg3NTgv0gF2aHR0cHM6Ly9pbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2NpdGllcy9tdW1iYWkvbXVtYmFpLWJtYy1zd2ltbWluZy1wb29scy1tZW1iZXJzaGlwLW9ubGluZS1yZWdpc3RyYXRpb24tODEwODc1OC9saXRlLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mumbai: BMC swimming pools membership will now be given online,"On Tuesday the BMC opened online applications for membership to Sri Murbalidevi Swimming Pool in Dahisar.

Acquired for €22.6 million ($22.5m) the site is leased to AtlasEdge until August 2033.

Principal Real Estate the real estate investment team for Principal Global Investors this week announced it has acquired the first asset of the Principal European Data Centre Fund I (the Fund).

Location of the facility weren’t shared but Principal’s images match that of a former Colt DCS facility. AtlasEdge a joint venture between Liberty Global and DigitalBridge acquired a number of Colt facilities across Europe – including one in Barcelona – last year. Baxtel reports the Colt facility at Carrer de l'Acer 5 was a former industrial building known as Barcelona Steel and retrofitted around 2001.

Paul Lewis director of European data centres Principal Real Estate said: “With the launch of the European Data Centre Fund earlier this year securing the fund’s first acquisition is a major milestone. The off-market acquisition of the AtlasEdge data center in Barcelona provides our fund with an asset let on a triple net lease to a first-rate and rapidly growing operator in a key city which is experiencing substantial growth of demand for data center services.""

Principal closed a data center fund dedicated to acquiring European assets in February of this year raising €155 million (then ~$175.8m). The company also said it recently completed the second capital raise for the fund raising an additional €50 million ($49.7m) and bringing total equity investments to €205 million ($203.8m).

At least 60 percent of the fund will be allocated to the company called the ‘core’ European markets of Germany Netherlands France United Kingdom and Ireland with up to 40 percent going into other European markets such as Spain Italy and Switzerland.

“With the second close reaching €205 million we believe we are in a strong position to achieve our goals for the final close and to continue executing on our acquisition plans across Europe” Lewis added.

The vendors in the deal were represented by Savills.

Principal Real Estate began investing in data centers in 2007 and has committed more than $1 billion in data center acquisitions and developments while also owning more than $1.1 billion in data center REITs. Principal closed its first US data center fund last year raising €471.4 million (then ~$534.7m).

Earlier this month Principal partnered with Lincoln Rackhouse to acquire a data center in Atlanta Georgia. The two companies have partnered on a number of data center projects in 2019 acquiring colocation and managed services company Bytegrid together. Last year Lincoln sold a T-Mobile data center in Florida to a group owned by Principal Real Estate Investors.

Update: A spokesperson for Atlas Edge confirmed the prior landlord and not AtlasEdge sold the building to Principal with the company still operating it as a data center and no plans to exit the site.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpby5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS80MDUxMjUvOC13YXlzLWNpb3MtYW5kLWNocm9zLWNhbi1jb2xsYWJvcmF0ZS1mb3ItYnVzaW5lc3MtaW1wYWN0Lmh0bWzSAWFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaW8uY29tL2FydGljbGUvNDA1MTI1Lzgtd2F5cy1jaW9zLWFuZC1jaHJvcy1jYW4tY29sbGFib3JhdGUtZm9yLWJ1c2luZXNzLWltcGFjdC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,8 ways CIOs and CHROs can collaborate for business impact,"CIOs have a lot to gain by working with their C-suite colleagues if for no other reason than to gain a better perspective on different areas of the business. One of the most important relationships a technology leader can forge is with the chief human resources officer (CHRO).

From employee engagement to training HR executives are involved in a lot of initiatives that have a direct impact on IT.

What was old may be new again offering possible clues about the bull market’s next stages

As we orient our portfolios for a ‘PATTY’ (Pay Attention To The Yield) environment a substantial part of our strategy is to lean on dividends from our equity positions. Although a dividend is simply a cash payment to shareholders net of expenses and funds set aside to fund growth there are a lot of nuances to how the cash was earned. These nuances determine whether the company can continue to pay or ideally grow that dividend in the future. Today we focus on why dividends can be a useful part of an investment strategy our principles of dividend investing and finish with profiles of different types of dividend-paying companies and how we think about allocating to each of those strategies in our portfolios.

Why Dividends Can Be a Useful Part of an Investment Strategy

The act of paying dividends is in and of itself a powerful component of shareholder returns. Historically the compounding of dividends has represented a significant portion of the overall total return of US large-cap stocks. A study by NDR (Ned Davis Research) suggests that of the approximate 10.4% total annual return of stocks from 1926-2021 (see chart below) approximately 35% of that return came from the dividend (red portions of bar chart) second only to earnings (blue portions of bar chart) in terms of percentage contribution.

In the post-2009 financial crisis era earnings growth rather than dividend yield has dominated total return contribution. However in prior decades such as the 1930s 1960s and 1970s – eras dominated by greater economic uncertainty and volatility – dividend yield was a much larger portion of the overall return contribution to stocks. During these times dividends proved a reliable return driver in a world where valuation expansion and/or earnings growth couldn’t be counted on to augment returns. With our current ‘back to the future’ world of economic uncertainty and higher inflation we believe dividend growth strategies will be more important as earnings growth reverts to a lower more normalized rate through the next business cycle.

Our View: Three Principles of Dividend Investing

1. Steady dividend payments can be a sign of financial health

For a company to pay a dividend it must generate more cash than necessary to fund operations in most instances. Companies that achieve this stage of self-sufficiency typically operate in already well-established markets have attained a stable market presence and no longer need significant levels of capital for product development or marketing.

2. You can’t pay out what you don’t earn (at least not for long) and cutting a dividend can be a painful experience for a company

A risk with dividends is that investors punish companies for cutting dividends which can create a perverse effect whereby companies will borrow just to fund the dividend and essentially spend money they don’t have. This dynamic can turn the “dividends show discipline” argument on its head. This can create corporate risk for companies as they add debt to their balance sheets or forgo necessary investments to pay dividends and/or to avoid cutting a dividend which investors have learned to take as a sign of distress and lower stock prices accordingly.

3. It’s not just about dividends; we think free cash flow is more important than dividend policy

When researching a company or a theme RiverFront’s policy is to focus primarily on free cash flow. In our view free cash flow allows companies the flexibility to make positive capital allocation decisions. Depending on the business model and the maturity of the company this could involve investing back in the business or returning cash to shareholders in the form of share buybacks or dividend payments. With these principles in mind we recognize there are three primary approaches to paying dividends.

Our View: The 3 Broad Types of Dividend-Paying Companies and Their use in Portfolios

1. High Payers / Low growers: paying cash out as it comes in

Generally there are two types of companies that pay out almost all their earnings in dividends: risky cyclical payers and low growth equities. Risky payers tend to be companies in highly cyclical industries and sectors whose cash flow – and thus dividends – depend on a combination of cyclical earnings and debt. We view these dividend sources as lower quality because of the risks inherent in the industry. These companies frequently become ‘cheap’ because of their inherent risks prompting us to buy them selectively and tactically. We generally do not use these companies as a large part of a long-term strategy because of their cyclicality and risks of dividend cuts.

The other type of high-yielding dividend stocks are slow growing low volatility equities often in regulated industries. They typically have stable cash flow structures that make changes in earnings less likely than the average company. Their lack of growth prospects means they pay out most of their net profits. We view these types of companies as behaving similarly to fixed income instruments and believe they can be attractive at times in a balanced portfolio to get more income than bonds typically offer while presenting less downside risk than stocks typically do. The two major factors in buying companies in this category are: not overpaying for them and being aware of risks to their cost structure since revenue increases tend to be limited.

2. Dividend Growers: balancing dividends and growth

Companies that balance cash flow growth and dividend payments tend to be more attractive selections to RiverFront. A lot of our selection processes focus more on the free cash flow that is being generated from these companies than on the dividends that are paid as we recognize that even a company with a small dividend yield (dividends divided by the price) will eventually accumulate healthy amounts of dividends paid through steady growth and the principle of compounding over time. Indeed many of the highest performing companies in the S&P 500 (Standard & Poor’s Index 500) over the past ten years have paid a portion of their earnings out in dividends. These companies typically use the portion not paid out in dividends for share buybacks and reinvestment in projects creating a trend of profitable earnings and dividend growth that is attractive to investors.

Two common pitfalls when investing in dividend growers are: overpaying for growth and underestimating the threat of competition. Avoiding overvaluation requires being attentive to the value of a company and comparing it to the earnings it has and what we believe it will generate. Another risk with these companies is long-term loss of the competitive advantage that has allowed these companies to generate earnings. This means that as investors we must keep track of sources of disruption even in companies that we might not see as suitable investments.

3. Non-Dividend Paying Companies: reinvesting for the future

Non-dividend paying companies generally fall into two categories in our view: those with free cash flow and those without. Many of the largest most profitable companies in the S&P 500 choose to pay no dividends. We are happy to invest in strong free cash flow companies who are reinvesting in their businesses many of whom also buy back their own shares. By way of example some mega-cap technology companies have gone through long periods where they did not pay dividends and now do producing two of the largest dividend payers in dollar terms in the S&P 500.

We tend to avoid companies with unproven earnings or revenue. When researching a stock that doesn’t pay a dividend it is important to pay attention to the source of the company’s earnings and to attempt to be conservative in any assumptions regarding how long those earnings can persist. This leads us to be skeptical of many non-dividend payers.

Implications For Our Portfolios

As part of our portfolio strategy we can and will invest in all the different types of companies depending on the stages in the business cycle and the needs of the portfolio. We believe a prudent strategy both for our ETF and individual stock selection is to understand the underlying earnings and dividend generation power of a security and to compare that value to the price we are paying for it. In the current environment we prefer to seek income from our fixed income strategies or selective income alternatives. We then balance that with stocks whose yields are lower but where we see greater growth potential.

In Summary

We think dividends will be an important source of future returns

While dividends can be a source of financial discipline they are not something investors should blindly seek

We believe the best returns ultimately come from companies with strong free cash flow allowing them to sustain and grow their dividend.

The executive director of a reproductive health center. A collective board at a community soup kitchen. The owners of a socialist-themed plant-based meats company. The bosses at a punk doughnut chain and a queer bar. What do they all have in common? Often the answer is union busting holding captive audience meetings and violating workers’ rights.

Organizing against abusive and exploitive bosses at for-profit politically “neutral” companies is always difficult — but organizing workers at nonprofit organizations and businesses with a “progressive” image comes with a unique set of challenges.

At first glance nonprofit organizations like Planned Parenthood have little in common with companies like Starbucks. One provides essential reproductive and health care services to diverse communities and is governed by a board of directors that is often comprised of local community leaders. The other is a purveyor of standardized caffeinated beverages and a massive global corporate empire with untouchable billionaire CEOs and directors. But both organizations leverage their progressive personas to cover up power imbalances economic inequalities and exploitation of their workers in the “hidden abode of production.”

“Nonprofits have a role to play in capitalism and present themselves as something different as an alternative” argues Kieran Knutson the president of Communications Workers of America Union (CWA) Local 7250 and a longtime organizer. The nonprofit sector developed in the 1970s in part to provide essential services in areas abandoned by the state. As the state withdrew from service provision under neoliberal capitalism nonprofits backed by wealthy funders and foundations filled in using low-wage workers and the “volunteer society” to manage social conflict and mitigate the public’s demands for the state to provide them with resources. Said nonprofits rely on the good will of donors and a steady supply of those willing to work for the mission often without decent wages or a say in their workplaces. In contrast with directors on corporate boards those who serve on nonprofit boards are entirely removed from the processes of production services provided workplace conditions and demands of both their employees and clients. Corporate directors can be pressured because a strike or slowdown will affect the company’s bottom line and thus stock options salaries bonuses and compensation. But nonprofit directors may lack a personal economic incentive and hence that pressure point.

Cultivating a progressive and inclusive image has attracted a loyal diverse customer base and workforce for massive global corporations and small businesses alike. But the veneer of diversity and inclusion often covers for low wages with no benefits hyper-exploitation with either long or irregular hours and lack of power on the job. People from marginalized communities like queer people and people of color are often drawn to work for companies with a progressive image only to find that they regularly experience the same discrimination and abuse found in many workplaces. Signage that states “all are welcome here” is directed at customers and the public not employees. Even if these workplaces are more diverse they are often no more democratic or just than their politically neutral counterparts.

The problem with nonprofit corporations and businesses with a progressive image is that their ideals don’t apply to those who work there. Moreover said ideals are often lacking a class and power analysis. Challenge a “progressive” boss’s power and see how quickly they behave badly.

Progressive Bosses Behaving Badly

The veneer of diversity and inclusion often covers for low wages with no benefits hyper-exploitation with either long or irregular hours and lack of power on the job.

“This is not a democracy” stated the general manager of a sustainable organic member-owned food co-op as they fired a pro-union worker. The worker had accepted the cashier position in part because they were able to wear a “they/them” pronoun button at work an indication that their gender identity would be honored by customers and coworkers. And they were excited that in the wake of George Floyd’s murder their managers distributed Black Lives Matter buttons for employees to wear too. To the managers at the co-op however pronoun and BLM buttons were a step in the right direction; efforts to form a union and circulate a petition calling for hazard pay for frontline workers during a pandemic were steps too far.

Patricia* a member of the organizing committee at the co-op who I spoke to via Zoom in November 2021 was shocked by management’s response when the workers took their hazard pay petition public. Even with overwhelming support from coworkers and the community the day after it was announced “we walked into the breakroom and ripped-up pieces of the petition were everywhere” she said. “Then [a long-time employee and spouse of the finance director] wrote a really nasty letter that went out to the whole staff about how we were ungrateful and we were lucky to have jobs and we should be happy with what we get.”

Similarly the organizing efforts at a reproductive health center “all started with us doing a hazard pay petition” that management “refused to acknowledge” noted Josephine* a clinic worker and union activist. Immediately after the petition was launched the “CEO and CFO both said that they were going to be taking a 3 percent pay cut from their salary. Our CEO makes $220000.00 a year. So [the pay cut was] not very much. It’s about the same amount as our pay for three whole months.” Josephine and her coworkers presumed that this money was to be spent toward their demand for hazard pay but “come to find out after about a month they reinstated their full salary” she said. “So nothing happened. We don’t even know what happened with that money.”

Alex of the Crush Bar Workers Collective an affiliate of the Portland Oregon branch of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW )  was part of an “underground campaign” in early 2020 at the local queer bar where they were employed. Initially organizers “just started having meetings about workplace grievances and were slowly on-boarding people. The first major thing to organize around for us was better shift meals.” Management reacted poorly and “we got our shift meals taken away” they said. The organizing committee launched a petition to reinstate shift meals but as soon as they won with two-thirds of the workers signing the owner of Crush Bar used the pandemic shutdowns to fire all the employees involved in the union campaign. When the workers arrived en masse to pick up their final paychecks and speak with the owner they were threatened had their pictures taken and the cops were called. The owner along with managers and his supporters continued by “threatening people online and in interpersonal communication” including “outing folks and misgendering folks” Alex told Truthout.

These are not isolated incidents. Eric Artz CEO of REI a consumer co-op that sells expensive outdoor gear shared his pronouns and led a land acknowledgement before lambasting workers at a Manhattan location for organizing. “We do not believe placing a union between the co-op and its employees is needed or beneficial” he said in a subsequent email. Likewise the CEO of Amy’s Kitchen condemned the Teamsters for publicizing ongoing workplace injustices — including “defective equipment blocked fire exits workloads that lead to repetitive-stress injuries and a lack of bathroom breaks and access to clean water” — and a boycott followed. Just recently Amy’s fired over 300 employees and shuttered their production facility. No Evil Foods offers vegan meats with radical-sounding names including “El Zapatista” chorizo and “Comrade Cluck” chicken under the tagline “Protein for All. In Plants We Trust.” Nevertheless their owners ran an intense intimidation campaign against unionizing workers holding captive audience meetings accusing the local union supporting the workers of corruption and then shuttering their production facility entirely firing staff without severance.

The boss of a homeless service agency Central City Concern was bold enough to call for a “no” vote for the union on video; a few miles away the Community Alliance of Tenants hired an expensive “infamous union-busting law firm” according to the union. When the recently unionized workers of the punk-themed Voodoo Doughnut went out on a safety strike in the middle of the worst heat wave in recent memory management fired them all. Workers with Doughnut Workers United also an IWW affiliate were only rehired after a pressure campaign and a National Labor Relations Board ruling against the employer. These examples as with the one about the Crush Bar workers are all from Portland Oregon. But progressive bosses are cracking down on organizing workers across the country and such conduct often only bolsters workers’ union campaigns.

Bosses Are (and Aren’t) the Best Organizers

The foundational myth of nonprofits and progressive politics is self-sacrifice for mission and members. This is a narrative that is often difficult to dispel much less overcome.

As any union member will tell you bosses can be the best organizers. But whereas the misleading — and potentially illegal — anti-worker and anti-union statements from out-of-touch executives such as Howard Schultz and Jeff Bezos can spur workers to organize or escalate their campaigns it’s a bit more complex when it comes to nonprofits and supposedly “progressive” bosses.

When bosses and managers at food co-ops reproductive health centers and queer bars provide prospects for advancement to marginalized peoples — including people of color women LGBTQ+ people immigrants and poor and working-class people — they are seemingly aligning with progressive values even while actively limiting these opportunities. When bosses and managers provide safe spaces to wear pronoun and BLM buttons or allow employees to be public about their gender identities it’s possible especially in small towns that this is one of the few workplaces that would affirm workers’ identities. But often it is these very workers who are organizing; the union effort being led at Starbucks stores across the country for example is led by “young female and queer employees.”

However calling the cops on working-class queer peoples or ignoring a national trend to award hazard pay to health care workers during a pandemic is conduct that contradicts the mission of many nonprofits and progressive businesses. Seeing a boss act counter to the mission goals aims and progressive politics of an organization or company is enlightening to workers and can spur them to action. Their experiences with power are educational; being disciplined retaliated against lied to and mistreated by a boss whom they may share values and political identities with is an opportunity to see how an organization or company — and neoliberal society as a whole —actually operates. The result can be a renewed commitment to unionization workplace democracy and radical change.

Often bosses use “middle management” to mitigate a unionization campaign Josephine noted. “It was difficult because you’re working in close proximity and you had their utmost support when this unionization first happened” she said then “we were dealing with serious retaliation from them which was hurtful and harmful.”

As a result of the bosses’ reaction to the hazard pay petition in the food co-op example the organizing collapsed and the union drive faltered. Here organizers were not only afraid of retaliation or losing their jobs but also of public scorn loss of standing in the community of negatively affecting an institution they believed in and upsetting bosses who ate lunch with them even as they controlled their working lives. By identifying the co-op’s management with its mission the organizers were unable to address the fundamental power differentials expand beyond their organizing committee and convince even their most radical members to act.

No wonder. The foundational myth of nonprofits and progressive politics is self-sacrifice for mission and members. This is a narrative that is often difficult to dispel much less overcome.

For Mission and Members

Like a progressive company’s image a nonprofit’s charge can be powerful. Workers are drawn to their jobs for the mission as well as the members. When a boss’s bad behavior and hypocrisy is exposed the mission still holds sway.

“When we talk about an employer like a [reproductive health center] you’re talking about workers who are there for the mission” Josephine said. “The pushback that we were getting from coworkers was being scared about being seen as not being a part of the mission anymore.” The fear typically experienced during a unionization campaign is compounded by fear that organizing will harm the mission. Additionally long-term employees — especially those who are older white straight cisgender and economically privileged — can become social leaders who actively rally against unionization and prevent their coworkers from organizing.

Workers at nonprofit organizations and businesses with a progressive image “are real workers who have real concerns and grievances and have a right to air them.”

Workers at nonprofit organizations and businesses with a progressive image “are real workers who have real concerns and grievances and have a right to air them” Knutson said. “But not everybody’s consciousness just crystallizes. Often there’s some kind of crisis where workers just finally had enough and they can’t go on anymore.” The organizing challenge is to address the underlying causes of the crisis: that is the chasm between the stated mission and the organization’s ability to care for members clients and consumers with low wages and lack of democracy on the job. Most of all organizers must prevent the crisis from demobilizing and discouraging workers from organizing. This according to Knutson begins with “building cultures of solidarity that aren’t necessarily capital ‘P’ political but basically the way you treat people the way that you expect to be treated and the kind of norms that you represent when you’re at work. And I think those do make a difference and cultivating a kind of a culture around that is one of the ways to take it on.”

A culture of solidarity is a way for members to “live the mission” serve as a basis for further organizing resist repression and survive regardless of the outcome of the organizing campaign. Along with community supporters Crush Bar Workers Collective members were able to provide food boxes to fired workers and stipends for rent and other expenses. While the food co-op union faltered there remains a culture of solidarity among coworkers who are still employed and those who have moved on. But there is an important caveat especially when considering workers in these industries: solidarity and mutual aid must extend beyond friendship groups and social networks to all coworkers. What’s more mutual aid fortifies relationships and builds power toward demanding concessions from the boss in the short-term while continuing and expanding struggles in the long-term.

For Fairness and Fair Compensation

The mission of nonprofits extends beyond the worksite to members clients consumers and supporters in the larger community. Community members and activists can become an “unpaid PR department” for management Knutson said. “Bosses present workers as being selfish: that they are not seeing the goal of the mission of the nonprofit they’re only seeing their selfish needs in terms of benefits or wages or whatever when they should be thinking about the bigger picture.” Because the boss’s argument and power extend beyond the workplace so must our organizing and systems of solidarity.

Nonprofits and businesses with progressive veneers often require a steady supply of low-wage workers to perform jobs with high turnover rates scant flexibility and slim input. In addition to the sway that mission and members have over employees working at a nonprofit popular queer bar and a punk company like Voodoo Doughnuts has prestige. But you can’t eat prestige or pay rent with it — and prestige doesn’t give you control over the working day.

These workers are organizing to demand living wages and a say on the job. As labor scholar Robert Ovetz recently reflected:

Because the work is so closely tied to the mission workers have found some success going beyond simply wages and benefits issues. They are successfully flipping management’s narrative. Rather than management’s claim that higher wages threaten the mission better wages and working conditions help employees do the work of helping others by helping themselves. Nonprofit work no longer has to mean making poverty-level wages while helping clients in poverty.

For emerging and future organizing campaigns in these sectors bringing workers out of poverty through fair compensation is vital but not enough. “A lot of progressive organizations are very much invested in neoliberalism in capitalism even when they use language saying otherwise” said a former labor organizer with university-based union Kiana. “There are some really good structures to make people feel heard while nothing is actually being done. Then if you are being too loud or go public that’s when you would start to get hazed and kicked out.”

Moreover bosses and managers utilize the language of diversity equity and inclusion to undermine unionization and workplace democracy. One worker shared with me how their highly paid boss attempted to shame a mostly white low-wage workforce by saying “how dare you ask a woman of color for a raise.” Another recounted a story of how a white clinic manager covered up for the anti-trans and homophobic abuse of a coworker by claiming that “diversity includes older white women from another generation.” And the food co-op referenced above donated considerable funds to unspecified “Black causes” while claiming they could not afford to pay more than minimum wages. The boss at Crush Bar “pitted [workers] against Black Lives Matter in this absurd and bizarre way” Alex said. “It was toxic and manipulative and just totally inaccurate.” Recently the president of the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts — who in 2020 personally made $308191 and has 10 directors who make over $100000 on her payroll — claimed that Roe’s overturn meant that workers shouldn’t unionize. They have the money just not for their employees.

“I would emphasize that management’s gonna manage” said Patricia. “It doesn’t matter if they’re feeding homeless people it doesn’t matter if they’re rescuing puppies or protecting rivers. Management is management. There is still a power dynamic that can’t be challenged by you on your own you can only do that with the union with your fellow workers.”

Bosses and managers utilize the language of diversity equity and inclusion to undermine unionization and workplace democracy.

Ways to change power dynamics at work include labor management meetings workers councils giving workers a say on corporate boards ensuring workers are present at nonprofit board meetings horizontal pay structures (which limits the gap between lowest and highest paid) transparency around financial and programmatic decisions worker input into foundation partnerships and individual grants employee stock ownership and transitioning to a worker co-op model. All of these measures begin with organizing and lead toward a union and workplace democracy.

A Union and Workplace Democracy

Every organizing campaign comes with its own set of challenges especially for those working in nonprofits and “progressive” businesses. Workers are confronting bully bosses low wages a lack of benefits and the denial of a sustainable work-life balance and control over the process and product of their working day. Recent efforts to organize in these sectors represent a reckoning that is a long time coming. Nonprofits cannot profess progressive politics and businesses cannot hide behind a progressive facade without addressing the challenges brought by unionization and workplace democracy.

Organizing is about creating new relationships and relations of power on the job as well as in the industries and communities these workers are part of. “It’s important to remember that your coworker relationships and how you feel about each other is ultimately the most important thing over winning goals over outside perception anything like that” Alex said. Without these bonds demands for better working conditions will not have the force needed to succeed power cannot be built and organizing cannot be sustained.

“I remembered when I first started at the co-op hearing that there had been union efforts before this” Patricia said. “So even though this campaign failed everyone involved learned a whole lot and [we witnessed] shifts in how management acted. Unionization at the co-op is dormant; these movements never die.”

All organizing comes with risks and that is true of these sectors. There has been a rash of nonprofits and small businesses that have shuttered rather than share power with a unionized workforce. There are also imminent political and economic threats facing the working class and the left in the United States. Our task is to organize and democratize our workplaces while avoiding the pitfalls of prior generations. “There’s risk of getting pulled into the logic of managing a business in a capitalist context but I think the positive side of it is conceiving of something different and conceiving of us in power even though it’s on a micro scale” Knutson said. “And I think all those are worth it.”

A common adage is that there is “no ethical consumption under capitalism.” To this we should add that there are no ethical workplaces either — only better ones which have collective bargaining agreements or are organized by solidarity unions with power on the shop floor.

(AP) — Maxwell Alejandro Frost burst onto the national scene when he crashed a June interview with Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis with calls for action on gun violence in America.

“Nobody wants to hear from you” DeSantis told Frost as security swarmed.

On Tuesday Frost 25 found thousands of people who did want to hear from him so much so that he won a Democratic primary for an open U.S. House seat in a liberal district positioning himself to become the first member of Congress from Gen Z.

In an interview Frost described the interaction with the governor as “ good trouble.”

“That video is really a microcosm of what’s going on in Florida — the governor shooing people off who might have a different opinion being rude being a bully” as supporters cheered him on Frost said. “And we know the majority of people in this state are not in line with that type of governance and that type of thinking and I truly believe that’s part of what led us to victory here.”

Frost who campaigned on gun control and Medicare for all and won high-profile endorsements from progressive U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren beat out a crowded cast of Democrats who ran for the seat in Florida’s 10th Congressional District which includes the Orlando area.

He will compete against Republican army veteran Calvin Wimbish in November for the seat left open when Val Demings decided to run for U.S. Senate. The district is considered reliably Democratic making Frost a favorite this fall to become the first member of Congress from Gen Z those born after 1996.

On his website Frost detailed his Cuban heritage noting his mother put him up for adoption after she was “caught in a cycle of drugs crime and violence while pregnant” without health care. He also wrote about experiencing “police abuse firsthand” and gun violence in his community while highlighting his activism work around voting abortion and guns.

Frost’s victory on Tuesday came over a crowded field that included experienced Democrats including former U.S. Rep. Corrine Brown who was in Congress from 1993 to 2017 and was convicted of a federal tax charge and the former congressman Alan Grayson whose inflammatory comments have generated headlines.

“Don’t count out young people. Don’t count us out just because we’re young” Frost said. “When young people have the resources training that they need and support they can really flourish.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vamFjb2Jpbi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC9kZW1vY3JhdGljLXBhcnR5LW5lb2xpYmVyYWxzLXByb2dyZXNzaXZlcy1zcXVhZC1mYWN0aW9uc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Right Fearmongers About Progressives But the Democratic Party Remains Neoliberal,"Turn on Fox News or look to any right-wing media outlet and you’ll be fed a constant diet of stories claiming that progressives and the Left have taken over the Democratic Party. On paper they seem to have a point: the Democratic Party’s progressive and neoliberal wings in Congress are almost evenly balanced. The Congressional Progressive Caucus has ninety-nine voting members in the House of Representatives and the New Democrats (the home of the party’s neoliberal hard core) claim ninety-eight as of August 2022. But that picture is a serious distortion of the real balance of power in Congress and inside the Democratic Party. In truth the membership numbers of official caucuses do a poor job of capturing the strengths of the Democrats’ factions. Despite efforts by progressives to tighten caucus rules for example the Democratic Party’s Congressional Progressive Caucus still claims as members many representatives who oppose progressive priorities like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. The party’s other two ideological caucuses — the Blue Dogs and the New Democrats (whose political differences seem fairly minor at this point) — are somewhat more ideologically consistent but do not include all members who could reasonably be classified as “neoliberal Democrats.” In order to develop a realistic sense of the party’s factions as well as their respective strategies and opportunities for growth we need to ignore affiliation with ideological caucuses and go straight to the positions congressmembers have taken on key internal party debates. Doing so reveals that the party’s neoliberal wing still holds the dominant position and also exposes the unreliable nature of many in its progressive group.

Counting Factions This article looks specifically at the factional composition of the Democratic Party in the 2021–22 session of the US House of Representatives. It groups Democratic members of Congress into four core factions: a left faction a progressive faction a center faction and a neoliberal faction. Additional members who occupy gray zones between these factions are placed in two groups of leaners one leaning toward the progressive/left wing and the other toward the neoliberal wing. Democratic members of Congress are grouped according to the positions they’ve taken on four ideologically charged and divisive debates inside the party: 1) whether or not to support Medicare for All 2) whether or not to support the Green New Deal 3) whether or not to support the nation’s “defense” (war) budget 4) and whether or not to weaken aspects of the system of mass incarceration. (For the last question I’ve used as a proxy members’ votes on a failed amendment to the For the People Act proposed by Cori Bush which would have restored voting rights to those convicted of a felony regardless of whether or not they were currently incarcerated.) Members were scored for each position they’ve taken on these issues that align them with the party’s progressive and left factions. Four points (taking a progressive/left position on all four issues) placed a member in either the party’s progressive or left faction (more on the distinction between the two below) three points in the party’s lean-progressive group two points in the party’s center faction one point in the party’s lean-neoliberal group and zero points in the party’s neoliberal faction.

The Neoliberals Are Still in Charge The party’s neoliberal faction including neoliberal leaners consists of 115 members and makes up about 52 percent of the total Democratic caucus. The party’s progressive and left factions including progressive leaners consist of seventy-two members and make up about 33 percent of the party’s caucus. And the party’s center faction consists of thirty-three members and makes up about 15 percent of the party’s caucus. In internal party debates the party’s neoliberal wing clearly dominates a commanding position reflected in party leadership. All three of the party’s top officers in the House — Speaker of the House majority leader and majority whip — are neoliberal Democrats: Nancy Pelosi Steny Hoyer and James Clyburn respectively. On the party’s powerful internal Steering and Policy Committee which decides committee assignments for party members the neoliberals hold 48 percent of the committee’s sixty seats giving them a near majority on critical internal party personnel decisions. In coalition governments between center-right center-left and left-wing parties in multiparty systems a dominant center-right party will almost always corner the most important ministries covering economic issues and international relations. It usually denies those positions to their partners on the Left. The same is true for the factional distribution of committee seats in the Democratic Party. The party’s neoliberal wing has a well-defended monopoly over key House committees. Neoliberal Democrats (including leaners) command outright majorities on three of the four committees widely thought to be the most powerful and important when it comes to economic issues. Neoliberals hold 64 percent of Democratic seats on the Appropriations Committee which makes critical decisions about funding government programs. They hold 53 percent of Democratic seats on the Energy and Commerce Committee which determines government policy for telecommunications consumer protection public health energy and interstate and foreign commerce among other issues. And they hold 54 percent of Democratic seats on the Ways and Means Committee which determines tax policy and oversees Social Security unemployment benefits Medicare and welfare programs. Only on the powerful Financial Services Committee where regulatory policy for Wall Street is determined do neoliberals hold a minority (45 percent) of Democratic seats though they can rely on support from the center faction to steer committee policy. Neoliberals also hold majorities on the powerful House Rules Committee (56 percent) which sets the agenda for the House as well as all four committees focused on international relations and military policy — Armed Services (65 percent) Foreign Affairs (59 percent) Intelligence (54 percent) and Homeland Security (53 percent). The party’s neoliberal wing guards entry into these committees. Going into the 2019–20 congressional term both Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib were snubbed by the party leadership for positions on the powerful Ways and Means Committee. And in the lead-up to the 2021–22 term AOC was again denied a spot she sought this time on the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee.

The Progressive Minority Political observers are not wrong to note that the Democratic Party has a substantial progressive minority within its ranks though its size is often exaggerated. United around key demands like Medicare for All the Green New Deal shrinking the defense budget and reducing mass incarceration progressives have helped put a more left-wing platform forward for the first time in decades. Nevertheless the progressive faction is not as distinct from the party’s neoliberal faction as one might think. To begin with progressives centrists and neoliberals all come from similar class backgrounds. Based on available biographical information somewhere between 85-90 percent of progressives and centrists come to politics from professional occupations — mostly lawyers but also some doctors professors and so on. Slightly fewer members of the neoliberal wing (in the low-70 percent range) come from professional backgrounds. That is due to a higher representation of members from occupations that could be categorized as capitalist (14 percent of neoliberals) or managerial (12 percent of neoliberals). An insignificant number of members of any of these factions come from working-class backgrounds either from white-collar or blue-collar jobs. Moreover for members we have data on thanks to the Center for Responsive Politics the median Democratic member of the House in 2018 (excepting the left faction — more on them later) had a net worth of about $1 million. Median net worth does not differ substantially across these factions. Progressives and lean-progressives had a median worth around $831000 while neoliberals and lean-neoliberals had a median net worth of $1.3 million. (That figure is certainly influenced by the fact that the party’s wealthiest members — like Pelosi who had an estimated net worth of $114 million in 2018 — are concentrated in the neoliberal and lean-neoliberal camps.) Progressives centrists and neoliberals alike therefore share very similar class backgrounds. All three factions are made up overwhelmingly of millionaire or near-millionaire professionals. Progressives centrists and neoliberals alike therefore share very similar class backgrounds. All three factions are made up overwhelmingly of millionaire or near-millionaire professionals. Even more important progressives centrists and neoliberals all share a similar dependence on big donors and PACs. According to data from the Center for Responsive Politics for the 2020 election cycle progressives on average only got about 10 percent of their donations from small donors giving less than $200. That’s indistinguishable from centrists and neoliberals who both got on average about 8 percent of their donations from small donors. And while business clearly plays ideological favorites — centrist and neoliberal Democrats received on average $470000 and $597000 from business respectively — progressives raked in on average about $305000 from business PACs. These similarities point to an uncomfortable fact. While progressive Democrats take the right positions on a number of left-wing and progressive priorities their class backgrounds and dependence on corporate donors and wealthy benefactors set definite limits on their ability to really champion left-wing causes. Their commitment to causes like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal has never really been tested for example. It’s far easier to cosponsor a bill than to actually vote for it once the party leadership and one’s donors start to turn the screws. And in the 2020 Democratic primary one of the few real tests of progressives’ commitment to their own professed politics only 20 percent of progressives and zero lean-progressives endorsed Bernie Sanders. That’s compared to 10 percent of progressives and 31 percent of lean-progressives who endorsed Joe Biden. (I count here only endorsements made before the primary was settled.) To their credit progressive organizations like the Justice Democrats implicitly recognize this. In 2022 the organization — which is one of the most credible and effective national groups dedicated to boosting congressional primary challenges from the left — endorsed six primary challengers in this current election cycle. One Justice Democrats candidate took on a member of the party’s neoliberal wing (Jessica Cisneros challenged Henry Cuellar in Texas). But another two challenged members who are at least nominally part of the party’s progressive faction (Kina Collins challenged Danny Davis in Illinois; Rana Abdelhamid challenged Carolyn Maloney in New York before dropping out after redistricting). Justice Democrats’ attention to replacing these progressive Democrats with more reliable left-wing candidates points to just how compromised a good portion of the party’s progressive faction really is.

The Squad Is Really Different While the party’s progressive minority is a questionable ally for working-class politics the Squad — including Jamaal Bowman Cori Bush Rashida Tlaib Ilhan Omar Ayanna Pressley and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez — really do stand out. When it comes to class backgrounds for example the uniqueness of the Squad comes into sharp relief. The median net worth of a member of the party’s left wing (based on estimates for Tlaib Omar Pressley and Ocasio-Cortez) was negative in 2018: -$28750. And while half of the Squad comes from what I would categorize as professional or semiprofessional backgrounds (Bowman was a principal Tlaib a community organizer and Pressley a political staffer before being elected — though the last two occupations are hard to classify) Bush was a nurse AOC a bartender and Omar an educator. While progressive Democrats take the right positions on a number of left-wing and progressive priorities their class backgrounds and dependence on corporate donors and wealthy benefactors set definite limits on their ability to champion left-wing causes. Most notable the Squad stands out for its relative independence from corporate and wealthy donors. The average Squad member received 56 percent of their donations in the 2020 election cycle from small donors giving less than $200. The congressional left wing’s ability to champion working-class issues is bolstered by the independence they gain from relying on regular people to support their campaigns. Of course even on the congressional left it must be said there are clear weaknesses — especially on key issues like the national liberation struggle in Palestine. The decision last year by Jamaal Bowman to vote for US funding of Israel’s Iron Dome was a grave mistake as was his indefensible decision to tour Israel’s apartheid regime. On the Iron Dome AOC first voted no then changed her vote to present and then apologized for not voting no. (The rest of the congressional left — joined by a handful of progressive Democrats and one centrist — stood strong and opposed funding the Iron Dome.)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vdGhlcmpvbmVzLmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDIyLzA4L3JlaS13b3JrZXJzLWp1c3QtdW5pb25pemVkLWFnYWluL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,REI Workers Just Unionized—Again – Mother Jones,"Fight disinformation: Sign up for the free Mother Jones Daily newsletter and follow the news that matters.

Some people hike from coast to coast. Others unionize. In Berkeley California trailblazing workers at Recreational Equipment Inc.—the leading retailer for people who like to touch grass—voted Thursday to join the United Food and Commercial Workers’ 30000-strong Local 5 breaking 56-38 in favor. The victory makes them the second REI branch to organize following in the footsteps of workers at the company’s Manhattan flagship store which unionized in March.

REI’s management likes to invoke the company’s progressive credentials especially by emphasizing that the company is a “cooperative”—a “different kind of company” as they put it. But as I’ve reported before REI isn’t a worker co-op where staff get a decisive stake in ownership pay and benefits:

Emphasizing the word “co-op” is a clever rhetorical move on REI’s part: For many of us the term evokes farmers’ markets and stands run by barefoot hippies. We’re probably thinking of worker co-ops which are slowly becoming more popular throughout America—and REI probably knows the phrase has an appealing ring for outdoorsy left-leaning consumers. In a worker co-op the workers own the business typically sharing profits in ways the worker-owners have reached consensus on. That’s not what REI does. REI is a consumer co-op: a buyers’ club meant to give bulk discounts and better deals to customers. Technically the consumers own the company buying in with a $20 lifetime membership that includes benefits like an annual dividend on future purchases exclusive sales and the ability to vote for their board of directors.

The “Greenvests” as REI’s workers call themselves are pushing the company to establish a culture they say is more in line with the progressive values it preaches. “We want to be a part of developing the agreements that impact every aspect of our working lives” the Berkeley union’s organizing committee wrote to store management in a letter signed by 12 employees. “We don’t just want to be heard—we want to be active stewards of our store alongside you.”

The Berkeley store is significant for the company. Opened in 1975 it was REI’s first store outside the Seattle area. It’s huge boasting nearly as many staff as the SoHo REI that unionized earlier this year. Now its workers see an opportunity to pitch their tents under clearer skies: they’ve alleged understaffing overwork and racist behavior by some managers. Workers said that a meeting they believed would address their concerns about racism turned out to be a captive-audience anti-union lecture according to Liberation News.

Meanwhile the slick anti-union messaging faced by New York REI staff made its way across the country. Union members argue that the “progressive” giant’s language crosses the line—federal labor law mandates “neutral and objective” phrasing in employers’ please-don’t-unionize leaflets—and that managers spread anti-union misinformation in a string of one-on-one surprise meetings.

If you’ve followed the company’s union fights you might not be surprised. Last time around senior executives hosted a now-notorious podcast—workers alleged union-busting then too but at least management acknowledged that it was taking place on Indigenous land.

“REI believes in the right of every employee to vote for or against union representation” the company wrote in an email. “We fully supported the vote process in Berkeley and will continue to support our employees going forward.”

And that’s exactly what their employees seem to be doing perhaps dragging their bosses by the hiking boots.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmVncm9jZXIuY29tL25lYXJseS0zMC1ncm9jZXJzLW5hbWVkLWZvcmJlcy1iZXN0LWVtcGxveWVyLWxpc3TSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nearly 30 Grocers Named to Forbes' Best Employer List,"Costco Wholesale fared well on the Forbes list coming in No. 1 in Colorado Idaho Nevada and Washington.

The city of Hutto announced Aug. 24 that Skybox and Prologis purchased approximately 220 acres in the city where they will build a data center campus. (Carson Ganong/Community Impact Newspaper)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMjMvYnVzaW5lc3Mvd2FyZWhvdXNlLWRlbWFuZC1jb25zdW1lci1zcGVuZGluZy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Red-Hot Warehouse Market Tested as Consumer Spending Slows,"Since the beginning of the pandemic warehouse owners have been able to expand their footprint and raise their rates thanks to soaring e-commerce demand and a dearth of warehouse space in many U.S. markets.

But that growth is facing headwinds including a slowdown in consumer spending and rapid inflation which could test the resiliency of the business industry watchers say.

“If the consumer stops spending because of high gas and food prices that reduction in demand means that there are going to be less goods coming into warehouses” said Joseph Ori executive managing director of Paramount Capital a real estate investment finance and advisory firm in Walnut Creek Calif. “It may not lead to a crash but we’re not going to see the big rent increases that we’ve seen recently.”

The slowdown in demand is compounded by an uptick in warehouse construction that may spoil the favorable conditions. But others argue that a crash is far away if it comes at all.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd3ZWVrLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDgvMjQvbWlubmVzb3RhLXZpa2luZ3Mtb3duZXItcGxhbnMtbWFzc2l2ZS1mcmVpZ2h0LXdhcmVob3VzZS1pbi1lYXN0LXBvcnRsYW5kLWhlYXQtaXNsYW5kL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Minnesota Vikings Owner Plans Massive Freight Warehouse in East Portland Heat Island,"The former Kmart on Northeast 122nd Avenue is slated for demolition to make room for a freight warehouse.

The Portland Bureau of Planning and Sustainability released a climate emergency plan last month outlining all the steps the city had to take to curb the effects of climate change before it’s too late: ditch coal-fired power plants promote bicycles retrofit buildings and plant trees among other things.

Special efforts must be made in communities of color in “outer east” the plan says where the impacts of urban heat islands are greater. To help there BPS proposes to convert the East Portland Community Center into an energy-efficient “resilience center” where people can go during extreme heat smoke ice and cold.

The residents of Argay Terrace one of those “outer east” neighborhoods have a question.

If doom is truly impending—to the point the city must build some kind of climate refugee center—why is Portland letting the mega-rich owner of the Minnesota Vikings build a 260000-square-foot freight warehouse that would draw even more diesel-powered trucks into a neighborhood that’s already blighted by them?

“This would be the most awful use of this space” says Megan Petrucelli a marriage and family therapist who lives in Argay Terrace. “It’s dooming the neighborhood to be an industrial wasteland. It’s not strategic and it’s counter to all the goals the city says it wants to meet.”

Most Portlanders probably visit just one address in Argay Terrace: the Costco on Northeast 138th Avenue. Or they know it as home to the abandoned Kmart on 122nd and Sandy with the sprawling parking lot where the Proud Boys gathered for a far-right festival in August 2021 that turned into a paintball and baseball-bat brawl with anti-fascists.

That as it happens is where Vikings owner Zygmunt Wilf plans to build his tilt-up concrete warehouse and lease it to Prologis the San Francisco-based company that helps companies like Amazon and Home Depot move merchandise around the world.

The Viking conquest in Argay shows how well-intentioned places like Portland continue to conduct business as usual on climate even as scientists warn that the old ways spell disaster. It also shows how low-income neighborhoods keep getting screwed despite lofty talk about equity and the special burdens that climate change puts on people of color.

Heatwise Argay Terrace is just about the last Portland neighborhood that needs another flat-roofed warehouse teeming with trucks says Vivek Shandas a geography professor at Portland State University who maintains a “heat map” of the city.

His map shows what he describes as an arc of heat that runs along the industrial zone on the Willamette River north through St. Johns to the Columbia River then back down along Interstate 205.

“Argay Terrace is right in the center of the arc of heat” Shandas says. “But we’ll probably never see the ground under this site again.”

Argay Terrace residents say climate is only one of their concerns about the project. Wilf’s warehouse would be across 122nd Avenue from Parkrose High School and a block north of Parkrose Middle School. The city approved an extra-big 60-foot-wide driveway into the property just north of Northeast Shaver Street which is designated a “safe route to school” by the Portland Bureau of Transportation.

Residents worry that trucks coming west would try to dodge traffic on Sandy Boulevard by turning south on 141st Avenue and taking Shaver to 122nd where it’s an easy right turn into the big new driveway. PBOT traffic maps show that somewhere between 101 and 500 trucks already rumble down Shaver each day even though it is marked “no trucks.”

“This industrial development is not fair to the residents who have lived here for years” the Argay Terrace Neighborhood Association wrote to city commissioners in April. “It is going to devalue properties and do irreparable damage to the community values livability and walkability of our neighborhood.”

Commissioner Mingus Mapps has heard complaints from residents in Argay Terrace Mapps’ spokesman Adam Lyons says. Residents can file a land use appeal. Otherwise there is little commissioners can do because the zoning allows the warehouse to be built he adds.

Argay Terrace is bounded by 122nd Avenue to the west the Columbia River to the north 148th Avenue to the east and Interstate 84 to the south. Development began in the 1950s when Art Simonson and Gerhardt “Gay” Stabney conceived a surburban neighborhood with ranch houses on curving tree-lined streets. They combined their first names to get “Argay.”

“Living’s really wonderful when you live in beautiful Argay Terrace” said an advertisement in The Oregonian on July 19 1959. “Gracious living…just minutes from town.”

Today the Portland Bureau of Transportation’s “equity matrix” shows that 41.5% of Argay Terrace’s population are people of color including Hispanic. The median income is $61806. On an income scale ranging from 1 to 5 where 5 is the lowest Argay Terrace is a 4 PBOT says.

And the northern half of the neighborhood is now crammed with warehouses—or worse. In 2017 the Metro regional government approved a waste transfer station at 138th and Sandy now run by City of Roses Disposal & Recycling. Next door is Speed’s Auto Auction where cars impounded by the city get sold to the highest bidder.

Wilf’s new freight warehouse might be more of a blight because it’s going on the south side of Sandy. That means there would be little separation between idling diesel trucks and the Hidden Oaks Apartments a modest development just over a fence and a hedge from the old Kmart. Industrial properties on the north side are kept at a distance by Sandy and the rail line.

The Kmart along 122nd Avenue closed in 2018 part of a nationwide purge of Sears-owned properties. That same year the city of Portland opened the door to Wilf by changing the zoning for the 13-acre Kmart parcel as part of the 2035 Comprehensive Plan.

The state has various planning goals one of which is job growth. Job-creating industries require land and Portland chose to change the Kmart lot from “commercial” to “general employment.” Planners had determined that there wasn’t enough “EG” land in the city and too much commercial according to an email from Steve Kountz senior economic planner at BPS to the neighborhood association.

Other reasons Kountz wrote were pursuing “policies that advance social equity including expanded growth capacity for widely accessible middle-wage jobs in East Portland” and “increasing income self-sufficiency for people without four-year college degrees.”

Commercial zoning would not have precluded a freight warehouse but it would have reduced its scope to no more than 10000 square feet says BPS spokeswoman Magan Reed.

Prologis declined to say how many permanent jobs the freight warehouse would produce. The new building would be LEED Silver certified Prologis senior vice president Ben Brodsky says in an email and the paved area would shrink by 195000 square feet. There would be beehives on the roof native plants around the site and spaces for food trucks Brodsky adds.

Ownership of the Kmart site is cloaked in an entity called RFC Joint Venture. Following leads in property records WW linked RFC and the property to Zygmunt Wilf who along with his brother Mark and a cousin named Lenny owns a New Jersey real estate company called Garden Homes.

Wilf’s father Joseph a Holocaust survivor who immigrated from Poland started the company with his brother in 1954 to build single-family houses. Reached by phone Mark Hoffman director of development at Garden Homes says the Wilf family has owned the Kmart property since about 1986 under various entities.

A Garden Homes subsidiary Garden Commercial Properties manages 25 million square feet of retail and office space. At 260000 square feet the new warehouse in Argay Terrace would increase Wilf’s commercial holdings by a little more than 1% making it a property he could probably do without. Residents of Argay Terrace say they desperately need the property to be something else.

“There’s nothing walkable out here” says Petrucelli the therapist. “This space could provide a lot of resources. You could go there to get groceries or a meal. We had daydreamed about what could happen at this site.”

He notes that the policy did not warn him that he or his policy were part of a class.

A lawyer for Prudential contends that the filed rate doctrine bars suits challenging approved rates.

A Delray Beach Florida resident has filed a lawsuit raising questions about what a long-term care insurance issuer has to do to make an LTCI rate increase apply to a specific LTCI policy.

In the lawsuit Florida resident Henry Seiden is asking the courts to protect him from a series of three LTCI rate increases imposed by The Prudential Insurance Company of America. The increases would raise his premiums by a total of 100% over three years.

Seiden argues that his policy was not part of the class of LTCI policies involved in the rate hike and that Prudential has not added the rate hike agreement with the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation to his policy.

Angel Cortiñas a lawyer for Prudential — a subsidiary of Prudential Financial — asked the court to dismiss the Seiden suit because the filed rate doctrine blocks Florida insureds from suing over premiums approved by Florida insurance regulators; because Seiden’s policy is clearly part of the class of policies affected by the rate hike; and because a policy provision lets Prudential increase the policy premiums.

Seiden and representatives for Prudential did not respond to requests for comments about the case.

The Policy

Seiden a lawyer bought his Prudential LTCI policy in 2003 then accepted an inflation protection benefit increase offer in 2009.

An exhibit shows that he had a policy based on form GRP 98516 with lifetime benefits 5% compound annual inflation protection and a 0-day benefits elimination period.

The original premium amount was $5318.09 per year. Adding the inflation protection increased the price to $5812.72 per year.

Prudential told him about an increase of about 25% in 2017. That increased the annual cost for the coverage to $8937.14 from $7149.66.

In 2021 Prudential told Seiden that it would implement three 26% increases starting in June 2021 with the increases pushing the annual cost of the premiums up to $18877.74 in June 2023. The three increases compounded annually and they led to the amount of the total annual premium doubling.

The Suit

Seiden is representing himself in the suit against Prudential.

He originally filed a complaint objecting to the rate increase in a state court in Palm Beach County Florida in April.

According to the fund house investing in PSU stocks offers a range of benefits. First the cost of borrowing is low owing to inherent sovereign comfort leading to better credit rating/standing. This is beneficial during rising interest rate scenarios.

Second PSU stocks have relatively less Key Managerial Personnel (KMP) risk from a continuity perspective as compared to promoter-run companies. Third PSU stocks have lesser risk of diversification into unrelated businesses.

Fourth PSUs usually tend to pay higher dividends. If invested directly dividends are taxed as per slab rates. When invested through a mutual fund such dividends are exempt from tax under mutual fund schemes.

The issue is the “worst crisis” the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (Naeda) has documented propelled by higher electricity prices and a soaring natural gas costs.

About 20 million U.S. households — roughly 1 in 6 — have fallen behind on utility bills.

The power bill crisis is worse in Europe where natural gas prices have spiked because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Policymakers have started aid programs for struggling families to help them pay the bills.

But in the U.S. there has been no such attempt at a similar program and much of the focus has been on the price of gas at the pump.

There have been a lot of utility shut-offs a dire possibility as the summer dragged on and the heat shattered records. The Bloomberg article noted the number of Americans who have had to make hard choices between using their tighter wallets for food housing or electricity.

The report also said that California’s PG&E Corp. saw an over 40% jump in the number of residential customers behind on payments since February 2020 while New Jersey’s Public Service Enterprise Group saw a boost of over 30% for those who are at least 90 days late.

But the economic woes of the past several months have been almost universal with the U.K. seeing a 10.1% jump in inflation in the year to July.

Russia's war against Ukraine is starting to hit home as surging energy prices lead to higher electricity bills for Americans across the country and some are unable to keep up.

According to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association 20 million US households have fallen behind on their utility bills creating the worst crisis the group has ever seen. And those past due payments have led some to getting their electricity shut off amid summer heat waves.

The surging utility bills are in part due to higher natural gas prices. In the US the price of natural gas has soared more than 150% year-to-date amid increased demand for the fuel from both overseas markets and at home.

""Electricity prices are expected to increase significantly this summer as result of rapidly rising natural gas prices a primary feeder fuel for electricity and a warmer summer creating additional demand for electricity"" NEADA said in its summer electricity outlook.

The association projects summer cooling costs are up about 20% year-over-year to $540 representing the biggest jump in more than a decade. And there's no signs that electricity prices will fall anytime soon as natural gas prices remain at elevated levels.

Higher electricity prices has hit low-income households the most with nearly 40% of them falling behind a monthly energy bill payment in the last year. Meanwhile nearly one-third of US households said they reduced spending on basic household necessities like medicine or food in order to pay an energy bill.

Ultimately the growth in late payments of utility bills has and will lead to more power shutoffs to homes that are behind payment.

""I expect a tsunami of shutoffs"" Jean Su of the Center for Biological Diversity told Bloomberg. That could spell disaster for the well-being of millions of American if extreme heat or cold temperatures hit the US.

Some US-based utility companies have already reported a sharp jump in the number of its customers behind on payments including PG&E of California which has seen a 40% jump since early 2020 and Public Service Enterprise Group of New Jersey which has a 30% jump since March of this year.

While Americans have seen relief at the gas pump due to a long streak of falling gas prices from their early summer records that relief has yet to be felt in natural gas prices and by extension consumers' electricity bills.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vbmV3c3Jvb20vMjAyMi8wOC9hcHBsZS1wcm9wZWxzLWVudmlyb25tZW50YWwtYnVzaW5lc3Mtc29sdXRpb25zLWZvcndhcmQtd2l0aC1zZWNvbmQtaW1wYWN0LWFjY2VsZXJhdG9yLWNsYXNzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple propels environmental business solutions forward with second Impact Accelerator class,"August 25 2022

A vendor rating document from the omnipresent research giant said ServiceNow – a company promising user-friendly workflow software knitting together enterprise applications – ""continues to execute well expanding its offerings and driving execution around digital business transformation.""

But there were a few points of criticism pricing among them.

Gartner acknowledged ServiceNow had made progress on pricing but said some customers still face challenges.

They include a strategy which sometimes repackages functionality into new product type (SKU) as a way to ""upsell customers into newer and more expensive feature-rich products.""

At the same time ServiceNow would move customers away from legacy bundles to individual solution pricing as features move from an ""MVP status to mature."" This too results in unexpected increases in pricing.

Lastly enterprise license agreements – meal deals supposed to lower prices of individual products – sometimes increased prices Gartner found.

""Customers are struggling to understand the value of enterprise license agreements (ELAs) expecting enterprise pricing to be lower but ELAs are not all geared toward lower pricing (and may be higher than 'à la carte') but are designed to enable greater flexibility in terms"" the ServiceNow vendor rating said.

The Register has offered ServiceNow the opportunity to respond.

Another point Gartner makes gives observers the opportunity to reflect on ServiceNow's claims about its position in the software market.

The company grew out of the IT support function essentially providing ticketing and helpdesk software.

But CEO Bill McDermott has described ServiceNow as the ""defining enterprise software company of the 21st century"" as he promoted its expansion into HR supply chain and customer support.

Gartner said: ""While ServiceNow's product line continues to grow technology workflows remain a key revenue generator. Gartner estimates that these generate about 70 percent of ServiceNow's total revenue.""

The research group also found 57 percent of net new average contract value for ServiceNow is from technology workflows which is still growing strong.

However Gartner found ServiceNow had improved its ability to engage directly with lines of business and was the fastest-growing vendor in HR service delivery and customer service.

ServiceNow had worked closely with partner organisations ""to combine the power and productivity of the platform with the domain expertise"" creating innovative industry solutions.

""Despite their breadth of innovation these developments at times can appear disconnected from each other raising questions about the long-term packaging and costs of new capabilities"" Gartner noted. ®

Updated to add:

A ServiceNow spokesperson has been in touch to say: ""ServiceNow deeply respects Gartner's perspective on the market. We work closely with them to inform their research and we act on their feedback. We've been open about our growth path which includes expanding into solution areas our customers prioritize – HR customer service security and risk ESG ERP and more – and delivering on our reputation for fast time to value and measurable RoI.

""In fact in 2Q22 while ITSM was in 12 of our top 20 deals Customer Workflows Employee Workflows and Creator Workflows were in even more – and our 99 percent renewal rate remains the industry's benchmark.

""Are there areas we can improve? Like any business yes. We have taken many steps to reduce complexity and increase transparency in our pricing and we'll continue to tie together the value and business outcomes customers receive with our platform and products."""
PTC,PTC,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vcHYtbWFnYXppbmUtdXNhLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzI1L3RvLXB0Yy1vci1pdGMtdGhhdC1pcy10aGUtZmluYW5jaWFsLXF1ZXN0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,To PTC or ITC that is the financial question,"Since the late 2000s the federal government has supported the solar industry – first through a grant and later through a tax credit that offset the up-front costs of solar power. In parallel the wind industry was given a Production Tax Credit (PTC). A PTC works much like the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) since both credits offset tax liability dollar for dollar. The main difference between the credits is that while the PTC generates credit for each kilowatt-hour produced for the first ten years of a project’s lifetime the full value of the ITC is provided up front immediately offsetting the project’s installation costs.

Now that the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has passed the new law of the land allows the solar industry to choose between the ITC and the PTC for its own projects starting in 2023.

The base value of the PTC is 0.3¢ per kWh for projects greater than 1 MWac. If your project pays prevailing wages that value increases to 1.5¢ per kWh. The PTC is then inflation-adjusted by the IRS. For 2022 that value comes to 2.6¢/kWh.

The question now becomes – which tax credit is more valuable? 30% up front or 2.6¢/kWh for a decade?

Showing off their financial analysis skills CohnReznick Capital tweeted out this Inflation Reduction Act: Tax Credit Monetization Analysis which answers whether PTC or ITC will provide a greater tax credit monetization.

Fundamentally the answer comes down to the upfront cost of a project versus how much electricity a system can actually produce per watt of rated capacity (net capacity factor). If a project is a large-scale facility with a highly efficient installation technique and great pricing (due to scale) the 30% tax credit is ‘smaller’.

For example a residential solar project that costs a total of $3.00 per watt to install will receive a tax credit of $0.90/W. Whereas a $1/W utility scale facility will receive ‘only’ $0.30/W. Of course the residential incentive is almost equal to the utility scale price per unit!

The second factor to consider is the quantity of electricity actually generated per watt of solar module capacity. Utility scale projects without a doubt have a massive advantage here. The best single axis tracker bifacial projects in the deserts are near 30% capacity factor. For comparison the capacity factor for residential solar in the northeast is a little over 10%.

With that the first chart from CohnReznick Capital (above) shows a comparison of cost and capacity factor. Higher up-front costs and lower capacity factors (in blue) should go with the ITC. Higher capacity factors with lower up-front costs show up as orange and would benefit more from selecting the PTC. For projects with no clear advantage either way financial analysts and asset owners will have to make a judgment call based on their perceived opportunity costs.

Cohn notes “ITC is determined upfront and may give investors comfort for tax planning and exit timing” while the “PTC Tax Equity structure may result in more efficient depreciation monetization (~2x) from a larger TE starting capital account and no basis reduction.”

CohnReznick Capital also says that if the asset owners can immediately make use of larger up front tax credit then that tax credit becomes more valuable. This shifts the blue area in the chart above roughly 10% toward the top right region favoring the ITC.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYWlucy5jb20vdHJuL25ld3MtcmV2aWV3cy9uZXdzLXdpcmUvdHJhbnNwb3J0YXRpb24tc2FmZXR5LWJvYXJkLW9mLWNhbmFkYS1jYWxscy1mb3ItcHRjLXN0eWxlLXN5c3RlbS1mb3ItY2FuYWRhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Transportation Safety Board calls for PTC-style system for Canada - Trains,"WINNIPEG Manitoba — The Transportation Safety Board of Canada has called for implementation of a form of positive train control on Canadian railroads and new crew training measures as a result of its investigation into a 2019 collision of two Canadian National trains near Portage la Prairie Manitoba.

The TSB found that factors in the accident on Jan. 3 2019 in which one train failed to react to a signal and hit the side of another train at 23 mph included a lack of alertness on the part of the engineer because of a lack of activity related to use of the Trip Optimizer system (similar to automotive cruise control) as well as fatigue; differing levels of experience that led to conductor to defer to the engineer when he failed to react to the situation; and the lack of a train control system that could slow or stop the train when the crew did not react to a signal alerting it to stop.

“The United States has fully implemented a positive train control system on all high-hazard track required by its federal legislation. This includes the U.S. operations of both CN and Canadian Pacific which have invested significantly in their locomotive fleets and infrastructure” TSB Chair Kathy Fox said in a press release following a Wednesday news conference. “The railway industry must act more quickly to implement a similar form of automated or enhanced train control system on Canada’s key routes to improve rail safety and avoid future rail disasters.”

The board also recommended that Transport Canada require railroads to develop crew resource management or CRM training — procedures originating in the airline industry to improve safety by addressing communication and decision-making skills.

“The aviation and marine industries experienced significant safety benefits with the introduction of CRM” Fox said. “This type of training could provide additional tools and strategies to train crews to mitigate inevitable human errors providing significant safety benefits in the rail industry.”

Communication issues contributed to accident

The accident occurred shortly after 6 a.m. after CN train 318 traveling east on CN’s Rivers Subdivision passed a Clear to Stop signal indication at mile 52.2. The conductor called out the signal but the engineer did not respond and the train with the Trip Optimizer system in use continued at track speed. There was no further conversation.

At mile 51.13 with train 318 traveling at 46 mph it passed the head end of westbound train 315. At this point the conductor of train 318 reminded the engineer of the Clear to Stop indication and the engineer disengaged Trip Optimizer and made a full service brake application; some 34 seconds later when a Stop signal came into view the engineer placed the train into emergency. Seeing the train would not stop in time the two crew members jumped from the train as it collided with train 315 at Mile 50.37 where the two tracks became a single track sustaining minor injuries. Train 318 was traveling at 23 mph at the time of the collision.

Two of train 318’s three locomotives derailed along with eight cars of train 315 with a fuel spill of about 3500 gallons from the derailed locomotives.

Along with fatigue issues the TSB report asserts that as demonstrated in this incident “when there is a significant difference in level of experience between operating crew members an authority gradient may develop in which the less experienced crew member may not always intervene to ensure compliance with all of the rules. … a less experienced employee may be reluctant to question the actions of a more senior employee or intervene in the operation of the train even when it may be critical to do so.” [The engineer on train 318 had hired on as a switchman/conductor in 2011 and become an engineer in July 2015; the conductor had been hired in November 2017 and qualified as a conductor in March 2018.]

This factor led to the TSB’s call for crew resource management training which it says “seeks to improve a crew’s skills abilities attitudes communication situational awareness problem solving and teamwork.” The agency said it has investigated eight other incidents dating to 1996 where ineffective CRM practices contributed to accidents. It therefore has recommended that Transport Canada require railways “to develop and implement modern initial and recurrent crew resource management training as part of qualification for railway operating employees.”

That prowess requires trained expertise to keep the work going.

One of those local companies Aurora is making moves to grow the workforce needed to sustain the industry in Pittsburgh: The self-driving firm is partnering with Pittsburgh Technical College (PTC) for an 18-month associate’s degree program for robotics and autonomous engineering technology. The program will train students to work as technicians on autonomous vehicles and related systems.

The first class in the program will kick off in early October. A little over a year ago the Strip District-HQ’d AV company — which went public through a SPAC deal in November — approached PTC about starting this program. Matt Blackburn senior manager of government relations at Aurora told Technical.ly the company’s leaders knew that as they think about the future and scaling their product they needed to scale their workforce as well. Aurora counted 1600 local employees as of fall 2021.

David Becker PTC’s academic chair of trades electronics and technology said from the school’s standpoint it wanted to launch this program because of the “explosion” of robotics over the last few years. And in a statement President and CEO Dr. Alicia Harvey-Smith noted the need for service engineer technicians specifically right now. This program will allow students to enter the career in a short period of time.

“The robotics industry is prevalent across so many industries right now from technology to healthcare and manufacturing. This program helps to propel students into all of those professions” Harvey-Smith said.

The new robotics program is an extension of a long-running electronics program at PTC.

“The thing that makes this program unique is the fact that it’s kind of a combination of different programs” Becker told Technical.ly. “It’s a combination between electronics and CAD — computer-aided design — and a combination with IT information technology and with our trades program for electricians.” That mix means students graduate with a unique set of skills.

The program is six quarters long or 18 months. Five of those quarters involve classes related to CAD blueprint reading electronics robotics technical report writing physics and the like. The last quarter is an internship that requires the student to complete 240 hours working in the industry.

Becker said this a good partnership because simply PTC trains technicians and Aurora wants technicians. The AV company’s team worked closely with PTC in building the curriculum as well as serving on advisory boards for it.

The program will be taught by PTC instructors with involvement from Aurora through seminars events and industry days where students will get to go out and learn about the work a certain company is doing — at Aurora and elsewhere.

“We’ll have them on our campuses” Aurora’s Blackburn said. “They’ll see the company they’ll see the culture they’ll see what we do here and I think they’ll be very interested and excited to come to Aurora but they don’t have to work at Aurora.”

For the first session starting in the fall PTC aims to fill all 20 spots with a diverse group of students. Aside from recent high school graduates Becker said the program could be a good fit for someone looking for a professional change such as a veteran looking for their next career.

Blackburn said he thinks this program is a good opportunity for people to get their foot in the door with robotics and autonomous vehicles.

“There’s a lot of opportunity to grow” he said. “That’s the other part that we think is really cool about these associate-level programs is that you can stack them.”

This isn’t the first education collaboration for Aurora. According to Blackburn the company has partnerships with schools in Montana and Dallas — where Aurora also has workers — focused on the industry needs in those areas. He said what the company is doing in Pittsburgh with autonomous vehicles is unique and this program reflects that.

“Pittsburgh has been our home from the beginning” Blackburn said. “We’re incredibly invested in strengthening our relationship with Pittsburgh and the Pittsburgh community and our work with PTC is just another example of how we continue that relationship far into the future.”

(TPI) to open a new solar and battery storage facility and maximize the group’s ability to harness clean energy. The cooperative and school district officially flipped the switch on the facility which was installed and will be owned and operated by TPI on Aug. 22.

The 2.375 megawatt solar array consists of more than 7000 panels on 15 acres of land near Sonora Middle School in Springdale. The panels include technology that allows them to track the movement of the sun to maximize generation. The project also contains 6.9 megawatts of battery storage to be used by Ozarks Electric.

Combining solar generation with battery storage will allow Springdale schools to offset about 95% of the total energy consumed by Don Tyson School of Innovation Sonora Middle School and Sonora Elementary School while helping Ozarks reduce its wholesale demand costs. The power generated by the solar panels will thus result in significant savings for the school district. At the same time Ozarks can utilize the stored battery power during peak times thereby reducing wholesale demand charges and controlling costs for their members.

“Working together we can meet the energy needs of our region and add renewable resources while continuing to provide reliable affordable power for our members” said Mitchell Johnson president and CEO of Ozarks Electric. This new solar farm also offers unique STEM opportunities for Sonora Elementary and Sonora Middle School students within the Springdale Public School district in particular. Jared Cleveland Springdale Public Schools Superintendent extolled the project as a great learning opportunity for students as well as providing “an avenue for Springdale Public Schools to reduce our carbon footprint all while saving critical tax dollars that can be reinvested in our students.”

Ozarks and TPI have demonstrated this concept with previous similar projects including the city of Fayetteville wastewater treatment system and the Ozarks Multi-Industry solar park. Derek Dyson CEO of Today’s Power Inc. also expressed enthusiasm over the project.

Springdale Public Schools has 31 campuses in Washington County and an enrollment of approximately 23000 students in pre-kindergarten through the twelfth grades.

Ozarks Electric incorporated in 1938 is a member-owned electric cooperative serving more than 79000 meters across nine counties in Northwest Arkansas and Northeast Oklahoma.

Today’s Power Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Arkansas Electric Cooperatives Inc. (AECI) a Little Rock-based utility service cooperative owned by 17 Arkansas electric distribution cooperatives.

Devon Self Storage plans to utilize the existing 86395-square-foot Kmart building at 1502 S. Fourth St. but also has plans to build another estimated 37000 square feet for a proposed self storage facility project. The company which filed plans under QOZ Self-Storage LLC hopes to use a total of about 123400 square feet on more than 13 acres.

Founded in 1988 the national self storage chain offers personal commercial military and student storage solutions. It has locations spanning 24 states as well as Holland Germany and France. There are three other statewide locations in the Pittsburgh and Harrisburg areas.

QOZ received conditional preliminary site plan approval before the Allentown Planning Commission this past April. Edward Gore construction manager for the project told lehighvalleylive.com they are still awaiting stormwater and final site plan approvals. Additionally Allentown spokeswoman Genesis Ortega said QOZ remains in the process of obtaining building permits for proposed renovations to the Kmart building.

According to city documents Devon Self Storage wants to convert the Kmart building into a drive-through interior self-storage facility. An entrance overhead door would be installed on the eastern side of the building toward the northern end. A wide driver aisle would be constructed through the facility exiting out the southern end. The interior of the building would include 590 storage units.

Another 220 exterior units are planned to be constructed on the southern end of the parking lot spanning the entire front of the building. Those units would be constructed as more traditional single-story self-storage units in a secured area. The northern parking lot plans to remain untouched.

Approximately 1000 square feet of office space additionally is planned where Kmart’s existing entrance is. A pair of existing rear loading docks also would be used by the new company. The entire site is expected to have 24-hour surveillance. A chain-link fence already has gone up around the property with Devon Self Storage representatives stating in planning commission minutes that access would be through a keypad.

The facility is expected to only be open to customers from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily. There are no striped parking spaces planned — folks drive up to their unit unload then drive away planning minutes state.

There are no plans for exterior storage. Devon is planning to renovate multiple facades for the project which would be a combination of metal panel systems over the existing building. Some front landscaping areas are expected particularly along the front drive aisle.

The vacant Kmart is adjacent to the Mountainville Plaza shopping center which houses several other businesses including Lehigh Valley Physician Group; Price Rite; Dollar General; Rite Aid and Maxx Fitness Clubzz.

Kmart began announcing in August 2019 the discount retail chain would be closing some stores in New Jersey and its Wilson Borough location at 320 S. 25th St. in Pennsylvania. By mid-December the Wilson Borough store was shuttered after a couple months of liquidation sales. That store remains vacant.

Transform Co. the parent of Sears and Kmart was formed after Sears Holdings declared bankruptcy in October 2018 beneath a reported $11.3 billion in debt. While the company did re-emerge somewhat after the bankruptcy Transform later continued to announce it would be closing nearly 100 Kmart and Sears stores nationwide by early 2020 businessinsider.com reported. The move to “streamline operations” included the Lehigh Valley’s last remaining Sears an anchor tenant at Whitehall Mall.

Other regional Kmart stores that shuttered included: Bethlehem Plaza in Bethlehem Township which lost its anchor in July 2013; Wind Gap Plaza in Wind Gap which lost its store in mid-March 2020; and at 4701 Tilghman St. in South Whitehall Township which The Morning Call newspaper reports had a store close in late 2017.

James Balliet lead leasing agent for Bethlehem Plaza told lehighvalleylive.com Wednesday there’s currently ongoing negotiations for a portion of the former Kmart building to be leased at the Bethlehem Township site. Tractor Supply Co. in spring 2022 moved into a portion of the former Kmart space at Wind Gap Plaza. Ocean State Job Lot moved into the other portion in September 2020. A third tenant is being sought for the rest of the Slate Belt site.

Property records show Planet Fitness has since occupied the former Kmart space in South Whitehall.

However when running Nextcloud you will eventually be restricted by the limits of your server’s disk or when a team using Nextcloud for coordination starts a new project and rapidly accumulates documentation.

While it is always possible to get more space by adding a new disk or purchasing a business plan on your favorite file-sharing host using Nextcloud’s external storage to outsource files securely to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) offers a simple solution. Once set up you do not have to worry about paying for unused space because you only pay for what you need.

Amazon S3 also opens the door to a lot of integrations with AWS which enables the use of AWS advanced functionalities such as starting entire cloud workflows when files are uploaded. In this blog post we will present how to setup secure and make the most of using external storage for Nextcloud on Amazon S3.

Introduction

With its many extensions it is a comprehensive cloud backbone for your collaboration needs. For example it can synchronize calendars take notes and provide integrations for collaborating on documents.

What is Nextcloud and what does it do?

Nextcloud differentiates itself from other cloud collaboration platforms by being self-hosted and open-source. This gives the user full control over every aspect of the setup. This also makes Nextcloud stand out for its security and privacy as well as flexible integrations with other platforms.

Furthermore being free and open-source software anyone is allowed to install and operate it on their own server which has led to a wide range of setups for all scales. For instance you can explore pre-created images to install Nextcloud on a Raspberry Pi for home networks tutorials for running on a managed server such as AWS Lightsail or commercial managed setups for enterprises.

The features and controls provided by Nextcloud will enrich anyone’s webserver setup while putting privacy and control first.

Why is AWS the perfect extension for your Nextcloud?

While Nextcloud provides the controls to manage your files and collaborate it is a server application. This means Nextcloud is running on hardware with pre-defined storage and specifications. Hence storage and capabilities are limited to the functionalities that the underlying host system offers or supports.

Using Nextcloud as an entry point and extending storage into the cloud is a strong combination to overcome the limitations of the Nextcloud server. Three key benefits stand out in particular:

Right-sizing storage and cost efficiency: While estimating the server needs for Nextcloud in terms of computation or a database is straightforward right-sizing disk space is a challenge. Provision too much and you will have to pay for unused capacity. Provision too little and you will not be able to store all the files and content you want to work on. Adding a cloud provider storage extension such as with Amazon S3 makes it possible to flexibly scale resources and avoid high fixed costs when space is no longer used. Security and control: In the spirit of Nextcloud AWS in particular provides you with the means and tools to secure your data and stay in control. Using encryption either with AWS-managed or your own encryption keys and other security features such as access controls you stay in full control of who can access your data. Integration with AWS services: The integration of Nextcloud with AWS puts many of the features offered by AWS at your fingertips. For instance you can use AWS Lambda to process files managed by Nextcloud or initiate workflows Amazon Cloudwatch to monitor files and access or Amazon S3 tools to manage your storage lifecycle or optimize cost efficiency.

Securely connect Nextcloud with Amazon S3

Getting the benefits of AWS for your Nextcloud setup is straightforward. More precisely you can use the external storage connector provided by Nextcloud. With this you will only see the familiar interface while Nextcloud handles interactions with AWS. Since storing or updating files on AWS can be used to initiate actions on AWS we can furthermore use this interaction as the entry for any other AWS services.

The Nextcloud manual has a good description of the required steps from the Nextcloud client side to use Amazon S3 for storage. Here we will use this as a starting point but focus on the AWS side instead. We will show how to set up the AWS access right from the start and how to use AWS controls to secure and expand on this setup.

Prerequisites

You should have access to the AWS account where you want to store the data. If not you can register one here: https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup

You should have a Nextcloud server running that you have access to.

Set up dedicated AWS Credentials

For access to AWS we will use a technical AWS Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM) user. More specifically we will use an AWS IAM access key attached to that user. As is good practice we will not use the administrator user of our account for access to Amazon S3 from Nextcloud but instead will set up a new dedicated user that has only the access permissions required.

To set this up log in to the AWS Console and navigate to the AWS IAM service.

Next select “Add User” and give that user a name of your choice. Then select “Access Key” as the only way this user can be used to access AWS. This is shown in the image below.

Finally on the next page select the access rights this user should have. Select the policy “AmazonS3FullAccess” and attach it.

Note that the policy “AmazonS3FullAccess” contains a very extensive set of permissions. These are needed only at the beginning for Nextcloud to create and configure your S3 storage and we will remove and restrict the role once the storage is created.

After reviewing your settings you will receive your credentials your Access Key ID and secret access key that we will use for Nextcloud.

Configure Nextcloud

Since we have the required credentials we can now configure Nextcloud. More precisely we need to activate the “external storage” module that allows us to use Amazon S3 as a data storage. For this log in to the administrative account on your Nextcloud and find the App Settings. Make sure that the app “External storage support” is enabled.

Set up the storage

With external storage support turned on and AWS credentials at hand we are ready to set up the Amazon S3 storage. Nextcloud will do this for us with the AWS user we created above when we configure the external storage.

For this go to your “Settings” browse to “External storage” and select “Add Storage” of type “S3.”

Here you need to configure the following entries as shown in the screenshot below:

A bucket name for the Amazon S3 bucket you want to use. This must be unique to all of AWS and contain only lowercase letters numbers and dashes. A region in which the bucket should be created. You should select one that is close to your server’s location. Refer to for a list of available regions. Select SSL to protect the communication between your server and AWS. The access key ID and access key from step 1. Which users or groups of users should be able to see this storage. The storage is shared across all that are selected. A name for the external storage you just created.

The remaining fields can stay empty; they are meant for different S3-like storage providers or legacy functionalities.

Once you accept the configuration Nextcloud will try to create a bucket for you in your AWS account. Also all selected users will now be able to access this storage by selecting “external storage” and then the folder name in their accounts.

This folder directly maps to the corresponding bucket setup in Amazon S3 in the selected region as you can see when you go to Amazon S3 in your AWS Console.

Secure the setup

The setup is now complete and should work as expected. However there are a few improvements we can make to fully benefit from the security controls AWS provides. We specifically use two key features. The first is the principle of least privilege which means the user we created for Nextcloud to access AWS should have only the rights to do what it needs to do to limit the damage from unintentional use. Second we want to limit the use of the access key to requests made by the Nextcloud server.

Minimize permissions and filter IPs

To secure the access to our Amazon setup we need to replace the current broad permission policy (S3FullAccess) with a granular permissions policy that limits the user to perform necessary actions only such as modifying content of the relevant bucket(s) and also limits the IP addresses from which those modifications can be done to those of our Nextcloud instance.

To implement these features return to AWS IAM in the AWS Console and select the user we created above under Users. Click on “Add Permissions.” Then create a new policy according to the picture below.

For the Actions select ListBucket GetBucketVersioning GetObject GetObjectAttributes PutObject and DeleteObject. This allows Nextcloud to list the content of its storage and perform required actions on the stored objects.

For the Resources enter the name of the bucket that Nextcloud uses. This will limit the Actions to adding and removing objects from this one bucket only.

For the Source IP enter the IP of your Nextcloud server followed by “/32” (if you have multiple IP addresses you need to adjust this CIDR notation). This limits the use of the policy to requests that are made by our Nextcloud server such that even when your access key is leaked an attacker cannot directly use it to access your files from his own address. If you do not know the IP of your Nextcloud instance it can be found by navigating to the “Systems Information” in Nextcloud when logged in as the administrator.

Note: You can achieve the same by using the following JSON policy instead of visually creating the policy. For this click on “JSON” in the policy creation stage and add:

{

""Version"": ""2012-10-17""

""Statement"": [

{

""Sid"": ""VisualEditor0""

""Effect"": ""Allow""

""Action"": [

""s3:PutObject""

""s3:GetObject""

""s3:GetObjectAttributes""

""s3:ListBucket""

""s3:GetBucketVersioning""

""s3:DeleteObject""

]

""Resource"": [

""arn:aws:s3:::<BUCKETNAME>/*""

""arn:aws:s3:::<BUCKETNAME>""

]

""Condition"": {

""IpAddress"": {

""aws:SourceIp"": ""<NEXTCLOUD_IP>/32""

}

}

}

]

}



You will need to replace <BUCKETNAME> and <NEXTCLOUD_IP> with their respective values.

After reviewing and confirming the new policy the user now has two policies: the new restricted one and the original S3UserFull accessible by everyone. After detaching the S3FullAccess policy we used to create the original bucket the final output should look as follows:

Secure the Amazon S3 bucket

In addition to securing the access to AWS you should also use AWS controls to harden the Amazon S3 storage using AWS standard controls.

Specifically we need to turn on “Block public access” an additional security control to prevent sharing a bucket online as one would do for a website. We also need to configure standard server-side encryption to encrypt data on S3.

For this go to Amazon S3 select your bucket and click “Edit” under the Encryption settings for the Properties tab.

Select an Amazon-S3-managed key for encryption.

If you need a dedicated encryption key in addition to the encryption that Nextcloud provides you can also use your own customer-managed key instead of the Amazon-managed key. In this case the only change to the description is that you also need to modify the user permissions policy we created above to include the corresponding actions (kms:Encrypt kms:Decrypt kms:GenerateDataKey) for that key.

In addition to encryption we also want to protect the bucket against unauthorized access. For this go to the “Permissions” tab and edit the “Block public Access” block. This will prevent accidentally publishing objects inside the bucket on the internet.

With these steps you have secured your setup by granting minimal privileges to the access used by Nextcloud to your AWS account and by hardening the Amazon S3 bucket through encryption and public access blocking. You are now set to use Amazon S3 as your extended Nextcloud storage.

Cleanup

In case you decide to remove your data and access to AWS again cleanup is straightforward.

In the AWS console

Go to Amazon S3 select your bucket and choose “Empty Bucket” then delete it. Go to AWS IAM navigate to the user you created and delete it. After that select the policy created and also delete it.

That’s it.

Summary

In this blog we described how to use Amazon S3 as external storage to flexibly scale your Nextcloud setup while staying in control. If you are using AWS this creates the link between your Nextcloud and the services AWS provides. If you are not using AWS yet it allowed you to get a first impression of the possibilities this could open up. You can get started with the AWS Free Tier today."

The Atlanta-based homebuilder paid more than $385000 per approved unit to purchase the 5-acre site at 1139 Karlstad Drive from the Sobrato Family Foundation documents filed with the Santa Clara County Clerk-Recorder’s Office on Wednesday show. The property is a vacant parcel where an industrial building once stood. It sits between highways 237 and 101 and is surrounded by three-story townhomes and apartments.

The city approved plans by The Sobrato Organization the foundation’s parent in May 2021 to build 135 townhomes in more than a dozen three- and four-story buildings. Roughly 12 percent of those homes 16 total would be set aside for people on moderate incomes. Mountain View-based Sobrato’s development group filed grading and plumbing permits earlier this year but none for construction according to Sunnyvale’s online permit portal.

Representatives for Sobrato and PulteGroup didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Sobrato Organization affiliates and trusts controlled by its founder John Albert Sobrato had owned the Sunnyvale site since 1992 title service records show. One of those trusts donated it to the Sobrato Family Foundation the main grant-making vehicle of the organization’s philanthropic arm in August 2021.

The deal expands Pulte’s portfolio of approved and under-construction homes in Silicon Valley to nearly 500. It’s building 356 townhomes and condos in nearby Santa Clara and San Jose most of which are on the site of a mobile home park on the latter city’s west side that’s being redeveloped into a mix of rentals and for-sale units.

Sunnyvale’s condo and townhome market is among the strongest in Silicon Valley with this year’s sales numbers on pace to finish slightly below last year’s $673 million in total sales volume. Nearly $50 million in condos and townhomes sold there last month second only to San Jose in Santa Clara County according to July Santa Clara County Association of Realtors data.

The Karlstad Drive site featured as a footnote in the story of Katerra a SoftBank-backed construction startup that once had $15 billion worth of building projects before filing for bankruptcy last year. Sobrato became one of Katerra’s customers in 2017 when the property’s then-owner received planning approval to redevelop it into a 250-unit apartment building. The two sides clashed over pricing among other issues people familiar with the matter told The Information in 2018.

Sobrato confirmed to The Real Deal in 2019 that the two were no longer working together on any of its projects including 1139 Karlstad Drive. That same year Sobrato filed plans with the city to develop the site into townhomes a new vision for the property that swapped out the previously approved apartments for for-sale homes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiY2FjdGlvbm5ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvcmVnaW9uLXBhc2NvL2dvbGQtc3Rhci1zaWJsaW5ncy1nZXQtYnJhbmQtbmV3LW1vcnRnYWdlLWZyZWUtaG9tZS1pbi13ZXNsZXktY2hhcGVs0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gold-Star siblings get brand new mortgage-free home in Wesley Chapel,"WESLEY CHAPEL Fla. — Building Homes for Heroes PulteGroup’s Built to Honor and other companies have joined forces to give Gold-Star siblings a brand-new mortgage-free home in Wesley Chapel.

The COVID-19 pandemic made clear the problem of uneven access to broadband.

Federal funding including a $42.45 billion grant program administered by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

Companies government and community leaders must work together to streamline permitting and be clear about buildout efforts.

Community outreach is essential in expanding broadband adoption.

Introduction

Broadband access creates opportunities for companies communities families and individuals. Government leaders educators business technology and telecommunication executives all agree. The importance is so critical that the United Nations in 2016 declared internet access to be a human right. Most recently the COVID-19 pandemic drove home the immense value of access to high-speed always-on internet.

U.S. Rep Colin Allred said he was shocked to learn that three out of 10 homes in Dallas County (population 2.6 million) do not have reliable Internet access. The pandemic was not responsible for the gaps in broadband access but the crisis did shine a light on the flaws in the system he noted.

“We saw kids going to McDonald's parking lots to do their homework” he said. “We have to bridge this digital divide that we know is also contributing to other divides in our community. That federal commitment to broadband doesn’t just end on the infrastructure side.”

Agencies that thought access was in good shape found differently. The leadership of Dallas College a Texas community college system with more than 100000 students thought they would be prepared for a switch to online learning. A large proportion of its students had already enrolled in online classes recalled Dr. Kay Eggleston president of the community college district’s Richland campus.

“When everyone was sent home what we discovered is these students were taking their online courses on campus. They were using all the campus resources the computers the labs everything we had. We were thinking they were at home doing online virtual learning and that wasn't the case” she said.

Congress has provided funding. The U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that passed in 2021 includes $65 billion for broadband with Texas poised to receive more than any other state Allred said. It’s critical that Texas make the most of this opportunity he added. The largest portion of the $65 billion is $42.45 billion available to states via a grant program administered by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). The NTIA’s Broadband Equity Access & Deployment (BEAD) Program is focused specifically on funding last-mile broadband development.

“This is our largest investment that we’ve had in our infrastructure since the Eisenhower era [1953-61]” Allred said about the $550 billion legislation. “It’s unlikely we’ll have another federal bill of this size pass in my lifetime.”

But funding is only the first step toward making broadband equitably available and more affordable. Buildout of systems to rural areas and neglected urban areas presents challenges. And guiding remaining households that have not yet added broadband to do so will require coordinated outreach from community leaders governments business executives and educators.

Methodology

With agreement on the high-level mission and funding in place Infosys and the Richardson Chamber of Commerce convened an elite group of elected officials and industry government and community leaders to discuss broadband affordability and access. The forum featured a cross-section of stakeholders including CEOs CTOs government and agency leaders. This roundtable is the chief research input for this paper.

Allred led off the discussion among Texas political leaders and industry executives convened by Infosys and the Richardson Chamber of Commerce in Richardson Texas on June 2.

Other speakers and panelists included State Sen. Nathan Johnson Richardson Mayor Paul Voelker representatives from public school institutions Dallas College and Richardson Independent School and leaders from the Governor’s Broadband Development Council the North Texas Commission and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. They were joined by industry representatives from AT&T Altice USA (parent company to Suddenlink Communications) Quanta Services Inc. and Charter Communications. (A full list of participants is in the references section.)

All parties expressed high-level agreement to collaborate on key goals including:

Expanded access to broadband

Streamlined permitting

Sustained outreach programs to improve adoption identify access gaps and spread awareness of affordability programs

Continued discussions on standards in terms of what constitutes access performance and privacy

This initial gathering achieved its goals to share perspectives identify friction points and imagine ways to extend broadband access and adoption as widely as possible in Texas. Infosys aims to convene broadband roundtables in additional regions across the US in the coming months.

Literature review

Much has been written on the technical effort to expand broadband access and the intricacies of tapping funding sources for fiber network buildouts.

These discussions typically begin with the acknowledgement that broadband has grown to be an absolute necessity for the function of business government and community and then continues with that top-down community approach to covering swaths of territory with broadband access. In the US this literature typically draws from the Federal Communications Commission’s Fixed Broadband Deployment map which tracks the number of providers and their reported download and upload speeds.

However the detrimental impact for a household or individual lacking reliable affordable broadband access has only more recently become clear. As noted in writings from the International Monetary Fund the World Economic Forum and others this is one of the many ways the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted and exacerbated existing structural and societal inequalities.

Policy context

Broadband adoption in the U.S. initially grew rapidly but has stalled. One percent of U.S. adults used broadband in 2000. That zoomed up to roughly half of Americans by 2007. However in the next 14 years broadband adoption inched up by an average of less than 2 percentage points annually to just 77%. Encouraging the remaining 23% of households without broadband to adopt is increasingly difficult.

Equipment access and network information control cause friction and constrain broadband buildout according to industry representatives.

On the adoption front education leaders and politicians say too many people continue to rely on ad-hoc internet access or institutional support for their primary broadband access. Companies must do more to extend access all the way into households not just to the curb.

Analysis

Our analysis focused on gathering different perspectives to the multi-faceted challenges of extending broadband access to near-universal reach making it affordable to all while fairly compensating providers and boosting adoption as much as possible.

The answers to these challenges can be developed by convening leaders from government business technology education and community groups for discussion and then following up with action.

On the surface Texas has achieved high rates of fixed broadband access: 92% of Texans have access to broadband. And upward of 97% of residents in the four most populated cities have access to 100-megabit-per-second broadband.

But broadband access in Texas is uneven. From a household perspective some 2.8 million Texas households – roughly 22% of households – lack broadband access according to the Texas Broadband Development Office. The lack of broadband has an outsized impact on rural communities communities of color and low-income families the office notes.

No single entity is positioned to dictate the method to expand broadband access adoption and affordability. Rather political leaders agencies and companies must engage in robust collaboration to orchestrate money expedite buildout and support adoption and affordability outreach.

Challenges

Funding

Congress has allocated $65 billion for broadband buildout. This is a generational outlay comparable to the US rural electrification effort a century ago but more technical and with potentially greater overall benefits.

Richardson Mayor Paul Voelker states the individual benefits of widespread equitable broadband access at the household level will deliver benefits for cities regions and employers. Companies seek to do business in places with robust broadband infrastructure and network technology including 5G optical networking public and private networking and mesh networks.

“What’s needed are all sorts of things that telecom leaders know how to deploy and implement. These capabilities will differentiate cities counties and states” Voelker said.

Community college campus president Eggleston said homes without broadband also lose access to equal opportunities. Measuring broadband access can help leaders gauge the equity and fairness of opportunities in their communities.

“We want prosperity in our communities. You can't get prosperity just by recruiting companies into the region without the infrastructure and the support to families and communities to thrive and prosper as well” Eggleston said.

Buildout

Even with funding agreement and commitment offering broadband for all is stilled constrained by persistent friction points. Those include control of information securing work permits and provisioning equipment.

Mike Peterson AT&T vice president of external affairs said his company has historically worked well with government agencies but is increasingly concerned over disclosure requirements around the details of network systems build outs information AT&T considers proprietary.

“We'd love to know where Charter [Communications] is building. They would love to know where we're building as well” he said.

For companies building out broadband networks permitting at this stage is a greater challenge than construction said Robert McGee Quanta Services senior vice president of operations and a member of the Texas Broadband

Development Office board of advisors. Quanta Services specializes in planning designing and building infrastructure including power and telecommunication networks.

“When we look at a build from start to finish… construction is the easiest part” McGee said.

Network developers are also now confronting demand-side challenges related to workforce supply chain and new requirements tied to “buy American” provisions noted Matt Furlow director at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Technology Engagement Center. The buy American provisions generally require 55% of a manufactured products to be made in the U.S.

“That is really hard to do especially for broadband equipment” he said adding that many companies and states will be competing for the same equipment for their own buildouts. The White House in April 2022 issued guidance on how agencies and companies can request waivers on the Buy American provision.

Outreach

Despite those headwinds telecommunications providers have excelled at building out a comprehensive network said state Sen. Nathan Johnson who represents part of Dallas and its suburbs. The next challenge though is to convert high levels of access to equally high levels of adoption.

“The private sector goes out and does a miraculous job of creating this technology deploying this technology providing access to close to 100 percent” Johnson said. But even though 90% of Texans have broadband access less than 70% have signed up for service in their homes.

“We’ve got to be on the ground identifying who really is lacking access and understanding how we give it to them” Johnson said.

Sustained collaborative outreach between companies governments and local agencies will help bring that picture into focus.

It’s not just the equipment on the network side that must be considered. The effort to deliver broadband more equitably must also capture a clear view of what equipment is available to end-users said Akbar Kara president and CEO of the Lonestar Education and Research Network a fiber optic network provider to education and health care institutions in Texas.

“It's not good enough for my partners in telecom to bring that fast fast pipe to the front door” said Kara a member of the Texas Governor’s Broadband Development Council. “Some of these community anchor institutions have aged infrastructure. They're still using Wi-Fi hotspots that they bought from Circuit City [a retailer that closed in 2009].”

“We need to get our policymakers to address this broadband aspect as well. The federal programs do not do that. How are we going to fill that gap and what role does the industry play?” Kara asked.

On the affordability front AT&T is working with the United Way to identify families who can benefit and the company wants to expand that initiative and partner with more organizations Peterson said.

People who have not adopted broadband are generally more likely to trust advocates from their own communities local organizations or churches. Local governments can play the role of convener and function as a clearinghouse linking local organizations affordability programs and service providers.

“We haven't cracked the code” AT&T’s Peterson said. “We’ve been connecting with other organizations but it's going to take all of us to crack this code.”

Policy options and recommendations

Solutions vary by geography and community

The challenge of extending broadband access to all requires collaboration among companies communities and all levels of government. The challenge takes different forms in urban suburban and rural areas said Todd Baxter government affairs vice president for Charter Communications a national cable television and residential telephone provider.

For example he said that communications infrastructure companies have built large networks in Texas with a good amount of “dark fiber” fiber optic communication lines that are installed but not in use. However they need the help of others to find the holes and gaps in their existing systems in populous areas.

“If anyone ever hears of a street or a pocket that is not served bring it to me” he said.

In rural areas with low population density Baxter said that telecommunications companies will need government partnerships to deliver broadband internet to the last million Texans without a provider. “We're on the precipice of solving the broadband problem in Texas” he said. “And I think everybody in this forum is committed to doing that.”

According to the Texas Broadband Development Office three groups predominantly lack broadband adoption: rural communities communities of color and low-income communities. Each of these groups require their own engagement and involvement in the best ways to establish access make it affordable and encourage adoption.

Broadband office combines technical depth strategic thinking

The emerging effort to coordinate industry agency and government is greatly aided through a dedicated broadband office. This new function addresses a state’s particular geographic issues broadband equity and buildout coordination efforts. Such offices bring together technical expertise with strategic thinking.

Industry executive Kara asked telecom companies to bring new thinking and consider time-to-benefit as a new metric for broadband deployment and adoption. This measures the duration from initial request to its provision.

“We need to start tracking time-to-benefit. You’ve got web-scale companies that innovate way faster than telecom companies have done in the past. The telecom industry needs to embrace some of the best practices that the web-scale companies are using.”

Each state should establish a broadband development office since agencies companies and elected officials all seem to agree on the mission to expand broadband access and adoption. A broadband office should serve as formal coordination point to share concerns and resolve issues related to funding access network buildout and adoption outreach.

Reach agreement on maps and standards

Many entities from the Federal Communications Commission and those at state and local levels have data and maps for broadband networks across the country. However these maps do not provide a sharp street-to-street building-to-building picture of broadband availability and regular usage.

Kara said efforts are under way at the state and federal level to increase visibility of broadband access from census-block to individual address level.

“The initiatives in place now will demystify availability is and access” he said.

Streamline permitting and reach consensus around network details

Federal and state money is on the way to fund network buildout. However public and private stakeholders must also take steps to convert these highly anticipated dollars to fair and maximum impact.

Governments on all levels must establish permitting standards streamline routine processing and set clear schedule expectations that protect public interests and apply fairly to all network operators.

Private network operators view their network details as proprietary but they are deploying networks in public rights of way. As an industry telecommunications companies must develop a clear consensus on their network technical and planning details that can be shared and what must be kept proprietary.

Implementation

In the 21st century broadband is as essential as electricity and water in the 20th century. However developing equitable access to broadband is more challenging than stringing copper wires or plumbing water mains.

The challenge to expand broadband varies by geography and requires different solutions in rural urban greenfield and brownfield contexts. Delivering and maintaining quality broadband is not as obvious as clean water and stable power supplies. Further the definition of adequate broadband access remains unclear.

Public and private sectors need to better coordinate and collaborate to address these more nuanced problems tied to broadband.

“Broadband is a basic infrastructure necessity” said Chris Wallace CEO of the North Texas Commission a regional public-private advocacy group. “It supports every mode of transportation. It goes along with water infrastructure. Without this basic infrastructure system people cannot function.”

But even as entities collaborate to deliver basic infrastructure more broadly the definition of basic broadband is evolving with technological progress and this requires frequent refinement and update.

Conclusion: Build broadband for the future

The FCC’s current standard for broadband — 25 Mbps downstream and 3 Mbps upstream — was last updated seven years ago and is no longer sufficient for the way that modern families work play and learn from home. “… Every time we have a technology advance in one area we see another one that requires more firepower” said Johnson the state senator.

The byproduct of continued growth in Texas could additionally strain network infrastructure Johnson noted. “We’re going to add 10 million people before the 200th anniversary of the state of Texas (in 2036)” he said. “That’s growing our population by a third. So we’re going to continue to work with industry to deploy the physical infrastructure as well as continue to increase affordability and make sure that everybody has the digital literacy to take advantage of broadband.”

The value of reliable broadband access has grown more distinct to Texans and indeed all Americans living through the COVID-19 pandemic. Conversely the disadvantages facing households that lack access or can’t afford broadband have multiplied.

In an increasingly digital society expanding access and encouraging equitable adoption of broadband is the shared responsibility of government business and community organizations. Early adopters and easy converts have already shifted to broadband. The remaining population and literal last miles will be the toughest to cover and the remaining households without broadband will also be the most reluctant to adopt. No single party can drive adoption on its own. While broadband for all will help many more citizens to participate in the American dream it is also an example how infrastructure can bring together multiple diverse groups for a common and commendable goal.

At the conference I was fortunate to see a presentation from Brent Wilson Senior Vice President of Global Supply Chain at Qualcomm. I was also able to interview Brent after his session to get a little more insight on how Qualcomm dealt with the Covid-19 pandemic what it means for the semiconductor chip shortage and where the company is going with its digital transformation strategy.

As Brent mentioned in his introduction it has been a challenging few years for semiconductor manufacturers. COVID-19 has fundamentally changed the way the world connects computes and communicates. For companies like Qualcomm that’s fueled unprecedented demand for the semiconductor chips they provide to power the technology we’ve all come to rely on. Concurrent supply chain planning is required for the company to navigate uncertainty and expand into new markets of automotive computing and connective intelligent edge.

Qualcomm’s background is rooted in smart phones and cell phone communication. The company creates semiconductors software and services related to wireless technology. The company has been rapidly expanding to new markets such as IoT. The question Brent asked for the future of semiconductors is how do you connect everything and give everything the intelligence it needs to make local decisions? That’s not exactly an easy question to answer. For Qualcomm it is all about innovation.

Qualcomm uses the Kinaxis Rapid Response solution for concurrent supply chain planning. The solution was implemented in 2012 in order to deliver a comprehensive sales and operations planning (S&OP) solution that was able to move into execution with high integrity. Within the semiconductor industry especially as the Covid-19 pandemic hit execution is key.

Brent pointed out that Covid created small interruptions for many companies in terms of sourcing semiconductor chip materials. There are different policies in place at different companies which carries over into granting companies licenses to be able to operate. The larger impacts have been more around shifts in demand from Covid; demand unexpectedly shifted into a different direction and consumed all resources above the forecast.

One of the biggest issues was the labor shortage during Covid. As Covid spread so too did factory closures. Qualcomm turned to more automation in its semiconductor manufacturing. The ratio of labor to output is more towards output so the company did not need as much labor. The key was to determine which product to focus on. This ended up being high end products. Qualcomm had to rethink its position in the mid and low space since they could not service all markets with a chip shortage.

Qualcomm also faced a raw material shortage. Some resins and epoxies were not available so the company had to look at alternative components or different methods of sourcing. By running what-if scenarios in their concurrent planning solution Qualcomm was better equipped to handle these disruptions.

Another disruption facing the company and the industry was the face mask shortage. Face masks and PPE were already worn in semiconductor manufacturing plants to ensure a dust-free environment. Suddenly face masks were in short supply as demand skyrocketed. Qualcomm had to look at alternatives to sourcing masks as well as using less physical labor to continue with its output.

I asked Brent how long he saw the chip shortage lasting. He told me that there is generally 6 to 7 percent growth in chip production year-over-year. The supply side is relatively fixed and there is no big source coming on board to flood the market with more chips. On the demand side there are some pockets that are showing weaker signals; some are based on the correction of work from home and demand is starting to abate. The unwinding of tariff wars is also helping. Since I interviewed Brent semiconductor manufacturers have seen a shift in the chip shortage crisis and are facing a glut of computer chips as smartphone and PC demand declines.

I asked Brent how Qualcomm prepares for the next big disruption. First and foremost he recommended that companies choose their battles for where they want flexibility. Companies need to analyze total supply and demand and have the discipline to follow through even if it takes money and resources. In normal times there is no benefit but companies need to stay the course even when demand and supply are equal. Dealing with disruption also takes agreements from customers. Customers need to understand that distribution could change depending on material supplies.

Brent said that Qualcomm is right in the middle of its digital transformation journey. Qualcomm is looking at how artificial intelligence can turn a physical environment and into 1s and 0s for better efficiencies. Qualcomm understands it needs the hardware that supports AI and it can make the product AI ready as a result. For now Qualcomm is looking at how it can continue to make efficient decisions on sourcing as well as how it can make the fastest decisions for its manufacturing needs. As the speed of manufacturing moves forward so too does the speed of decision making.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9zYW1zdW5nLXRvLWtlZXAtdXNpbmctYW1kLXJkbmEtZ3B1cy1mb3Itc29jc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Samsung To Keep Using AMD's RDNA GPUs For Exynos SoCs,"Although Samsung's Xclipse 920 integrated graphics processing unit based on AMD's RDNA 2 architecture has not lived up to expectations the consumer electronics giant will continue to use AMD's RDNA architectures for its future built-in GPUs the company disclosed on Thursday.

""We plan to continue to implement other features in the RDNA series by working closely with AMD going forward"" said Sungboem Park a vice president of Samsung who oversees GPU development. ""In general mobile tends to lag around five years or so behind consoles when it comes to graphics technology however we were able to incorporate the latest console technologies in the Exynos 2200 mobile processor quickly through our collaboration with AMD.

AMD's Radeon RX 6000 family of GPUs based on the RDNA 2 architecture is without any doubts the company's most competitive GPU lineup in many years even though ray tracing is not its strongest side.

But the Xclipse 920 graphics processor based on the same architecture did not really shine in Samsung's Exynos 2200 system-on-chip for smartphones either in compute or graphics workloads. Which is why Samsung inked a deal with Qualcomm to use its Snapdragon SoCs with Adreno graphics for its upcoming Galaxy S-series handsets globally as the head of Qualcomm recently revealed (ComputerBase first noticed this). Ironically Qualcomm's Adreno (which is an ambigram of Radeon) development has been led by Eric Demers who previously worked as GPU architect at AMD ATI and ArtX.

""We are very pleased to report that Qualcomm and Samsung have entered a new multiyear agreement starting in 2023 expanding the use of Snapdragon platforms for future premiums Samsung Galaxy products globally"" said Cristiano Amon chief executive of Qualcomm during the company's Q3 earnings call.

At present Samsung uses Qualcomm's premium Snapdragon SoCs for its Galaxy S smartphones sold in Asia and the U.S. its own Exynos SoCs are used in models sold Europe. The new deal allows Samsung to use Exynos for European Galaxy S smartphones but it does not necessarily oblige the company to do so. Therefore if Samsung has an Exynos SoC with a competitive CPU and GPU implementation it might use it instead of Exynos.

But Samsung is certainly playing it safe with its choice of SoCs and GPUs as it also intends to use Snapdragons for other mobile products as well according to Qualcomm.

""In addition to Galaxy smartphones the agreement includes PCs tablets extended reality and more"" said Amon.

While AMD's RDNA architectures are feature rich and scalable in terms of performance power and die size actual implementation matters a lot. A GPU realization depends on multiple factors including experience of its engineering team in general and with a particular GPU architecture in particular design decisions cost and process technology. Therefore Samsung might build a competitive RDNA-based integrated GPU sometimes in the future but its engineers need to gain general GPU development experience first and the only way to get it is to keep designing graphics processors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpemNoaW5hLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzI1L3doby13aWxsLWxhdW5jaC10aGUtZmlyc3Qtc25hcGRyYWdvbi04LWdlbi0yLXNtYXJ0cGhvbmUtbW90b3JvbGEtb3IteGlhb21pL9IBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpemNoaW5hLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzI1L3doby13aWxsLWxhdW5jaC10aGUtZmlyc3Qtc25hcGRyYWdvbi04LWdlbi0yLXNtYXJ0cGhvbmUtbW90b3JvbGEtb3IteGlhb21pL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Who Will Launch The First Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 Smartphone? Motorola or Xiaomi?,"We know that the second-gen Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 will debut sooner than expected. The reason is that Qualcomm wants to let smartphone manufacturers design and launch their flagship phones before the Chinese Spring Festival. So instead of December and early January the first models powered by this chip will hit the stores in November this year. Today a well-known Chinese tipster revealed that the new chipset would be released after the Double Eleven Qualcomm Summit. The first terminals with it onboard will appear on the shelves in the second half of November.

Motorola And Xiaomi Are Fighting For The First Launch

Previously Samsung was the first to bring new Qualcomm Snapdragon flagship chip smartphones to the market. But Xiaomi could dethrone the Korean company long ago. In the past few years Motorola has taken this role on it. So it causes a natural question – will Motorola launch the first Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 phone this year? If not the Xiaomi Mi 13 will debut it.

Gizchina News of the week Join GizChina on Telegram

Earlier today a Lenovo executive hinted that Motorola is going to grab the first launch of the new platform. Also this is the first promotion of the upcoming Motorola flagship smartphone which started three months before the launch.

Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 Parameters

As for the chip itself it is expected to use TSMC’s manufacturing process because it provides better energy efficiency. It turns out the design team of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 came from the Snapdragon 835. They had a special task to pay attention to power consumption optimization.

The Snapdragon 835 was out in 2016. Its energy efficiency is 25% higher than that of the first-generation Snapdragon 820 flagship chip. Of course regardless of architecture improvements it also benefits from the process upgrade from 14nm to 10nm.

Many analysts believe that the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 takes the Apple A16 as the target of energy efficiency. In other words this chip will challenge the upcoming Apple Bionic chip.

Chipset vendors like Qualcomm and smartphone makers such as Xiaomi and Realme said most existing 5G devices in the country will work on a 5G network based on the standalone (SA) mode which is most likely to be used by Reliance Jio to offer the next gen mobility services. Rajen Vagadia  president of Qualcomm India & SAARC told ET there was hardly any difference between SA and non-standalone ( NSA ) mode 5G smartphones. ""It's a software driven difference... we have around 50-60 million 5G smartphones in the market today. If an operator launches SA-based 5G then the device will remain the same and it will require a software update.""The comment follows Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal 's views that non-standalone 5G architecture - which Airtel will use to deliver 5G initially - has a more mature device ecosystem than those supporting SA mode.""There is a possibility that if the chip is a little bit older - from 2020 then the OEM (handset maker) might not issue a software. But a good part of 50-60 million 5G devices can become SA devices"" Vagadia said.The 5G NSA mode straddles existing 4G infrastructure such as mid-band spectrum (1800 MHz 2100 MHz bands) with the 3300 MHz band to offer 5G speeds. This mode is globally accepted as the necessary step before transitioning into a 5G standalone (SA) era where all infrastructure transmit only 5G signals.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdldGRyb2lkdGlwcy5jb20vc3RvY2stcm9tLW5va2lhLTYtMS0yMDE4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nokia 6.1 TA-1089 Firmware Flash File | Stock ROM |,"In this guide we will provide you with how to install stock ROM on Nokia 6.1 2018 (PL2) based on Android 9.0 Pie.

This information is provided for educational purposes only. Reader retains full responsibility for the use of the information contained herein.

The legalization of marijuana and its direct impact on the workplace garners a lot of attention and rightfully so. According to the 2022 Quest Diagnostic Drug Testing Index more workers are testing positive for marijuana than ever before.

“Positivity rates for marijuana in the general U.S. workforce based on more than 6 million urine tests continued an upward climb increasing 8.3% (3.6% in 2020 versus 3.9% in 2021) the highest positivity rate ever reported in the DTI. Over five years positivity for marijuana in the general U.S. workforce increased 50% (2.6% in 2017 versus 3.9% in 2021).” i

Yet according to the federal government there are many more alcohol users and abusers in the U.S. than marijuana users. The 2021 National Survey on Drug Uses and Health found that:

Nearly 60 million Americans 12 and older admit to using illicit drugs

More than 138 million people admit to being current alcohol users with… 61.6 million being classified as “binge” drinkers (5 or more drinks on at least one occasion in the past month) and 17.7 million being heavy drinkers (5 or more drinks on at least 5 occasions in the past month). ii



Alcohol is the single most used and abused drug in America. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) nearly 14 million Americans (1 in every 13 adults) abuse alcohol or are alcoholics. Several million more adults engage in risky drinking patterns that could lead to alcohol problems. iii

Alcohol Abuse and the Workplace

Many employed Americans with a drinking problem consume alcohol on the job. A survey of employees conducted by American Addiction Centers found that 14.7% of at-home workers and 3.3% of other employees admit to being “high” on the job every week. iv

Workplace alcohol abuse has a direct impact on safety and injuries. According to the National Council on Alcohol and Drug Dependence (NCADD):

Workers with alcohol problems are 2.7 times more likely than workers without drinking problems to have injury-related absences.

A hospital emergency department study found that 35 percent of patients with an occupational injury were at-risk drinkers.

[Breath] alcohol tests detected alcohol in 16% of emergency room patients injured at work. v

NCADD also reports:

Analyses of workplace fatalities showed that at least 11% of the victims had been drinking.

Large federal surveys show that 24% of workers report drinking during the workday at least once in the past year.

20% of workers and managers across a wide range of industries and company sizes report that a coworker’s on- or off-the-job drinking jeopardized their own productivity and safety. vi

Headlines from around the country would seem to concur:

“Amazon driver charged with OVI after Solon crash” (Ohio)

“School bus driver charged with DUI” (Arizona)

“School bus driver arrested after driving drunk with students onboard making stop at McDonald’s” (New York)

“Drunk pilot pulled off JetBlue flight police say” (New York)

“Oregon school bus driver charged with DUI after crashing with 10 students on board”

“Tennessee school bus driver charged with DUI after crash”

“Moving Truck Driver Arrested on DUI Complaint After Owasso Crash” (Oklahoma) vii

The Pandemic’s Impact

Numerous reports indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic has made the problem of substance abuse and its impact on the workplace worse. One year into the pandemic an annual report revealed a significant increase in alcohol and other substance use affecting 49% of American workers:

“Of the 49% of workers who reported struggling with some level of addiction the number of workers reporting lower productivity or missed work because of substance abuse or addiction has nearly doubled since 2019…

“With 36% further reporting that it has affected their work more since the pandemic began.”

Nearly half of full-time workers now report problem use of alcohol drugs or prescription medication and 19% report at least weekly usage.

“Alcohol remains the most common substance abused by workers.” viii

According to a 2022 report by LifeWorks and the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation 31% who drink alcohol have increased their consumption since the pandemic began and 29% who use drugs reported an increase in drug use. ix

What Workplace Alcohol Abuse Looks Like

Many sources highlight the outward signs and symptoms of alcohol abuse at work including:

Sleeping while working

Being tardy or not showing up

Poor decision making

Confrontational behavior with supervisors and coworkers

Unintentional injuries to oneself or others

Appears hungover or is still intoxicated

Lack of coordination

Has bloodshot or glossy-looking eyes

Slow pupil response

Inability to complete work assignments

Starts to sweat heavily

Slurs speech

Becomes nauseous and pale x

Alcohol Testing

Because of the direct effects of alcohol abuse on the workplace employers have a right and an obligation to take steps to address the problem. This can include screening employees for alcohol following accidents and when reasonable suspicion exists that an employee is on the job under the influence of alcohol. It is important for employers to understand:

No state prohibits employers from conducting alcohol testing when such testing is conducted in accordance with state or federal laws or to comply with government-mandated alcohol testing.

Some states require alcohol testing under certain circumstances and may limit or restrict it under other circumstances.

Some states require workplace alcohol tests to be conducted in accordance with specific guidelines which often mirror federal guidelines (See 49 CFR Part 40 Subparts J K L M and N).

The U.S. Dept. of Transportation drug and alcohol testing regulations require alcohol testing in specific situations and always pre-empt any state law conditions.

While the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) considers a current alcohol abuser to have a disability and is thus protected under the ADA employers in all 50 states still have the right to:

Prohibit employees from consuming alcohol while on the job and

Prohibit employees from being under the influence of alcohol at work. xi

An employer may be required under the ADA to make some accommodations for an alcoholic to attend counseling appointments. For example the ADA allows employers to “discipline discharge or deny employment to an alcoholic whose use of alcohol adversely affects job performance or conduct.” xii

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has issued directives relative to alcohol testing for employees and job applicants and employers should review these policies very carefully to ensure complete compliance. The agency also provides numerous examples or scenarios to illustrate under what circumstances alcohol testing may be permitted and/or when accommodations must be granted.

Alcohol Testing Methods

Today there are several accurate and scientifically sound alcohol testing methods which include:

Evidential breath testing (EBT) Permitted by the U.S. Dept. of Transportation (DOT) as an alcohol screen and required for a confirmation test Permitted by most states outside of DOT testing Some jurisdictions may only permit the use of devices approved by DOT’s Office of Drug & Alcohol Policy & Compliance (ODAPC). (See: “Approved Screening Devices to Measure Alcohol in Bodily Fluids” xiii and “Approved Evidential Breath Measurement Devices” xiv

Non-evidential breath tests Permitted for an alcohol screen; positive results must be confirmed with an EBT device for DOT purposes and in some states Check individual state laws as some states have specific conditions for the use of EBT devices Some jurisdictions only permit the use of devices approved by ODAPC

Saliva alcohol screens Permitted as a screen only under the DOT regulations Permitted by most states though some conditions may apply Some jurisdictions only permit the use of devices approved by ODAPC

Blood May be permitted under limited circumstances though not in all states In some circumstances employers may rely on a blood alcohol test conducted by medical personnel at the scene of an accident and/or in a hospital



A relatively new alcohol screening method introduced by SOBRsafe in May at the annual conference of the National Drug and Alcohol Screening Association (NDASA) involves detecting alcohol in a person’s system through the skin. The touch-based alcohol detector makes it possible to screen workers quickly and frequently without collecting a breath saliva or blood sample. xv

Conclusion

A 2015 study found that marijuana users commonly drink alcohol while they are consuming cannabis. According to the study:

“The prevalence of simultaneous use was almost twice as high as concurrent use implying that individuals who use both cannabis and alcohol tend to use them at the same time. Furthermore simultaneous use was associated with increased frequency and quantity of alcohol use. Simultaneous use was also the most detrimental: compared to alcohol only simultaneous use approximately doubled the odds of drunk driving social consequences and harms to self. The magnitudes of differences in problems remained when comparing drunk driving among simultaneous users to concurrent users. xvi

What’s the point? As marijuana legalization continues to spread across the country resulting in many more people using marijuana a simultaneous increase in alcohol abuse can be expected. As such employers have a vested interest in ensuring that their workers are alcohol-free while on the job. Alcohol screening when and how permitted is one of the most effective ways for employers to deter workers from using alcohol on the job or being at work while under its influence.

However enjoying it off the clock still has the potential to cost some people their jobs.

That could change with a bill making its way through the state legislature that would ban employers from firing or punishing workers for cannabis use outside of work.

Leafly Senior Editor David Downs breaks down the bill and what it could mean for California’s workers.

Is this a new effort?

David Downs: [Lawmakers] have been working on this type of workers’ rights to use cannabis off duty for a number of years.

Assembly Bill 2188 from Assemblyman Bill Quirk would make it unlawful for employers to discriminate solely for off-duty cannabis use.

This bill has come up several times in past iteration but has died repeatedly in the legislature. It's well on its way to potentially passing the senate this time and reaching the governor's desk.

How does California stack up to other states in protecting workers who use cannabis?

We're really lagging behind — 21 states now have medical marijuana workers’ protections and six states have recreational cannabis user protections.

That's salient because we're seeing about 9.8% of California workplaces test its employees meaning you could potentially not get a job or lose your job for that test.

Second to that the test itself is extremely unscientific. It's been around since the 1980s and it's never actually tracked impairment. Lawmakers are saying it's time to go.

Is screening for cannabis use still common or has it receded since legalization?

It's gone down. Where you really see drug testing happening is in low-income low-skill economically precarious jobs like retail and it tends to be a goldmine for companies in the actual testing business. It's a multibillion dollar business.

The leading urinalysis screener in America is called Quest Diagnostics. They did 11 million urinalysis screenings in 2021. When you look at this picture nationally it's really punishing the warehouse worker in the South or the Midwest or someone on probation who uses the like delta-8 THC.

It’s tripping up people for little things and it doesn't look like it's generating much in the way of actual safety in terms of keeping impaired people off the job.

Employers can also use drug testing to get out of potential workers’ compensation claims. So if you get injured on the job they're gonna give you a urinalysis screening. If it tests positive for marijuana [from] a joint that you smoked two weeks ago they're going to be able to say “We don't have to pay this workers’ compensation claim we think this person was impaired on the job.”

Which workers would still be subjected to marijuana testing under this bill?

Anybody who's working under federal law where cannabis remains a Schedule 1 drug and illegal and also in the building and construction trades.

Assemblymember Quirk wants to … make sure that those employers still have more forceful ability to screen their workers than the average person running the checkout counter at a grocery store or flipping burgers.

This bill does away with tests that use hair urine other bodily fluids but workplaces could still use saliva tests. Why?

We [have to] get back to the chemistry here. If you smoke a joint on a Friday you can fail a urinalysis test on Monday. And if you smoke a joint two weeks ago you can still fail your analysis test.

That's because [the urinalysis test] is not testing for active THC the molecule in marijuana that gets you high.They're testing for remnants of that active molecule and those can exist in the body even though they're not impairing you for weeks and weeks.

Assemblymember Bill Quirk’s bill says employers [should] actually come up with a scientifically valid way to test people for active THC. You can do that through blood saliva and marijuana breathalyzers. You can [also] give people coordination tests with smartphones to see how well they're responding and see if they need to be pulled off the job.

The bill is attempting to move employers into the 21st century with regard to marijuana impairment.

Is it a shoo the governor will sign the bill into law if it makes it out of the legislature?

Not at all.

The California Chamber of Commerce is opposed to it and so is the California Travel Association and retailers. There are a lot of big groups that have a lot of clout in Sacramento that could snuff this bill out again even though it continues to come up for review.

On the other hand [supporters include] the California Nurses Association and several workers unions like the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) as well as the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW).

I think that's really salient because these marijuana tests are a gateway to systemic classism in America which has a racial component. They are targeting low-income workers who are doing menial jobs with an unscientific test that can take away their livelihood or prevent them from gaining one.

That doesn't even touch what happens to probationers or people on parole and their requirement to also pass these unscientific tests. If Assemblymember Bill Quirk’s bill passes it's certainly another step in the march toward empowering and protecting workers vis-à-vis their employers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9naWFudHMtYnJpYW4tZGFib2xsLWJhY2tzLXNhcXVvbi1iYXJrbGV5cy1jb25maWRlbmNlLWxlYXJuZWQtaW1tZWRpYXRlbHktaG93LWNvbXBldGl0aXZlLWhlLWlz0gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9naWFudHMtYnJpYW4tZGFib2xsLWJhY2tzLXNhcXVvbi1iYXJrbGV5cy1jb25maWRlbmNlLWxlYXJuZWQtaW1tZWRpYXRlbHktaG93LWNvbXBldGl0aXZlLWhlLWlzLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Giants' Brian Daboll backs Saquon Barkley's confidence learned immediately how competitive he is,"Saquon Barkley is entering his fifth season with the New York Giants with a full head of steam.

The 25-year-old former Penn State standout appeared on the ""2nd Wind"" podcast and expressed his frustration with how his 2021 season ended and now going into 2022 he said he has a ""kill mindset.""

On Wednesday Giants head coach Brian Daboll was asked how Barkley’s new sense of defiance was going to carry into this year.

""I think that’s probably a good question for him. I just know that – I’ve said this before – since spring and since summer he’s done everything we’ve asked of him"" Daboll told reporters. ""He’s been really a pleasure to coach. He’s had a good mindset. He’s learned our stuff. He’s played hard and he’s ran hard. What’s in his head or what he’s thinking? I think is better off for him. I just know he’s done a really good job for us really since we’ve been here.""

Daboll said when he took the job he learned immediately just how competitive Barkley was.

""He’s ultra-competitive. He’s very very competitive. Not just on the field. Just really with anything. And you like to see that with your players. I wasn’t around him physically. You scout him coming out of the draft; he was a pretty talented player. But all of those things have shown up out here. But his talent his competitiveness has stood out.""

STERLING SHEPARD RETURNS TO GIANTS' TRAINING CAMP 8 MONTHS AFTER TEARING ACHILLES

Barkley has been ravaged by injury the last three seasons with his torn ACL in 2020 being the most damaging of them all as he played just two games that season.

Heading into the 2021 campaign Barkley still did not look like himself. However after a solid Week 4 against the Saints in New Orleans some believed he had turned a corner. Then he suffered an ankle injury against the Dallas Cowboys that shut him down for four weeks.

The effects of that injury looked to be felt even when he returned as Barkley totaled just 593 yards on 162 rush attempts last season scoring only one touchdown in Week 14 against the Los Angeles Chargers post-injury. Barkley said earlier this offseason that he feels much better than he did at the same point in 2021.

Barkley is playing on the fifth-year option of his rookie contract which means he’ll become a free agent once the season is over unless he and the Giants work out an extension.

Effective regulatory plans to combat rare disease is one of the key drivers of the industry. Furthermore the presence of a substantial number of registries that provide data and relevant information about related diseases has aided in revenue growth over the past years. Ongoing conferences to raise awareness about rare and ultra-rare conditions are anticipated to boost the adoption of diagnostic kits and services. For instance Ergomed and PSR Orphan Experts with their offices in the U.K. Germany the Netherlands Poland and other countries participate in various activities that are aimed at raising awareness in this area.

Moreover the Canadian Organization for Rare Disorders (CORD) offers a strong platform to streamline health policy and a healthcare system that is dedicated to the management of patients with disorders. The agency works with clinicians researchers governments and the diagnostic industry to advance R&D diagnosis treatment and service availability for all rare conditions in the country. As per the National Institutes of Health (NIH) around 30 million Americans have been identified with one of 7000+ known rare diseases. The number of patients undergoing disease testing is expected to increase in the coming years with growing awareness. The U.S. celebrates Rare Disease Day and promotes developments in this area by raising awareness.

In addition the presence of the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) an NIH-funded research network of 23 active consortia or research groups that includes patients researchers and clinicians who are focused on the diagnosis & treatment of disorders is anticipated to positively impact the industry. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic patients with undiagnosed and rare diseases have been facing significant health challenges. According to a study published in January 2021 by a group of researchers from the U.S. there is an urgent need for the development of approaches that can reduce the serious challenges affecting Rare & Undiagnosed diseases (RUD) patients and families. The challenges include diagnostic and/or prognostic uncertainty coupled with medical complexity leading to poor health outcomes.

In response to the challenges created by the pandemic patient support groups and professional societies are actively involved in addressing these challenges. For instance the Rare Chromosome Support Group (Unique) the British Society for Genomic Medicine and Genetic Alliance U.K. are actively involved in supporting advocating and providing information to patients with diseases. Several rare conditions remain unclassified. The charity SWAN U.K. estimated that around 6000 children are born each year with genetic conditions in the U.K. As per the agency the conditions are extremely rare and cannot be named. Thus there is a lack of proper diagnosis and prognosis for evidence-based treatment. At present around 50% of the children who undergo genetic testing in the U.K. would not receive a confirmed diagnosis.

Around 50% of the children with learning disabilities and approximately 60% of children with congenital conditions do not receive a definitive diagnosis to identify the cause of their disabilities. Furthermore the lack of awareness among patients and families about diagnosis and genetic testing has further impeded the industry's growth. North America dominated the industry in 2021 due to the high incidence of rare diseases a large number of registries the presence of substantial numbers of R&D facilities in this area and extensive investments in diagnosis. Asia Pacific is expected to register the fastest CAGR during the forecast years owing to the presence of a substantial number of organizations that are focusing on disease management.

Disease Type Insights

The endocrine & metabolism diseases segment is expected to register the fastest growth rate of more than 19.9% during the forecast period. In recent years the understanding of molecular and genetic causes of endocrine diseases such as Cushing’s syndrome has increased considerably. This boosts the adoption of genetic testing for endocrine diseases. Furthermore the identification of inherited mutations in patients with the primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease and bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia is anticipated to accelerate advancements in tools for genetic testing for early disease detection. The immunological disorders segment accounted for the second-highest revenue share.

Immunologic disorders such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS) are among the most prevalent rare diseases. The genetic profile of MS is one of the key focus areas among researchers operating in this area. This is primarily to obtain relevant insights into the causes and underlying physiology of diseases. Furthermore organizations such as the Australian and New Zealand MS Genetics Consortium (ANZGene) that bring together molecular biologists neurologists geneticists and bioinformaticians operating in this space to collaborate on research projects are anticipated to positively influence the segment growth.

Technology Insights

The Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology segment dominated the global industry in 2021 and accounted for the maximum share of more than 35.51% of the overall revenue. Wide availability and adoption of NGS-based gene panels for cancer neurologic disease cardiovascular disease pediatric conditions psychiatric disorders and other related disease testing have driven the segment. Strategic activities by key players are estimated to further drive the segment over the forecast period. For instance in June 2022 Avesthagen Ltd. formed a strategic alliance with Wipro Ltd. for the commercialization of its genetic testing offerings.

The portfolio comprises genome panels providing highly précised disease-centric analysis for diseases including autoimmune disorders neurodegenerative diseases cancers and rare diseases.WES is considered a high-potential genetic testing method in the case where the genetic cause of a rare disease is unknown and difficult to identify. WES is becoming the standard of care for patients with undiagnosed rare diseases. Exons make up around 1.5% of an individual’s genome and contain 85% of all known disease-causing mutations. Thus WES plays a crucial role in obtaining insights into protein making and disease physiology.

Specialty Insights

Based on specialties the global industry has been further categorized into molecular genetic tests chromosomal genetic tests and biochemical genetic tests. The molecular genetic tests specialty segment dominated the global industry in 2021 and accounted for the highest share of more than 41.03% of the global revenue. The segment will retain its dominant position growing at the fastest CAGR during the forecast period. Rapid technological advancements and expertise in handling & managing high throughput technologies within clinical settings are factors expected to boost the segment growth.

Molecular genetic tests enable investigating single genes or short lengths of DNA for the detection of mutations or variations leading to genetic disorders. Molecular testing is not only limited to rare diseases but also covers testing of ultra-rare diseases. Genome sequencing is the most advanced unbiased testing method and is readily available for both research and clinical settings. This is primarily on account of the declining costs of sequencing tests along with the continuous development of next-generation sequencing-based new tests.

End-use Insights

The research laboratories & CROs segment led the global industry in 2021 and accounted for the highest share of more than 46.93% of the overall revenue. Laboratories are the key end-users; in the majority of cases blood samples collected from patients are sent to a laboratory for testing. Laboratories offer testing based on various specialties including molecular genetic tests chromosomal genetic tests and biochemical genetic tests. Moreover molecular genetic testing-based laboratory testing is rapidly increasing worldwide. Genetic tests are conducted by multiple laboratories including those that are accredited with CLIA for clinical cytogenetics pathology and chemistry among other specialties.

The diagnostic laboratories segment is expected to register the fastest CAGR over the study period. The reason for its growth is the rising number of partnership and collaboration activities of diagnostic laboratories with genetic testing companies. In November 2021 Genomenon and Alexion AstraZeneca Rare Disease announced a strategic collaboration projected to make important information for the treatment and diagnosis of rare diseases more readily available. The goal of the collaboration is to empower the genetic testing laboratories with the data they need for the diagnosis of rare diseases.

Regional Insights

Based on geographies the industry has been further categorized into North America Europe Asia Pacific Latin America and Middle East & Africa. North America dominated the global industry with a share of more than 47.43% in 2021. The major share of the region can be attributed to the high incidence of rare diseases a large number of disease registries the presence of a substantial number of R&D facilities for ultra-rare diseases and extensive investments in the diagnosis of disease. On the other hand Asia Pacific is estimated to be the fastest-growing region during the forecast years.

This is mainly owing to the increase in awareness and diagnosis abilities. Furthermore the introduction of policies and frameworks to promote disease management will offer lucrative opportunities in this region. For instance in India in March 2021 an inclusive National Policy for Rare Diseases was permitted by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. In addition in 2017 a hospital-based National Registry for Rare Diseases was originated by the Indian Council of Medical Research by involving the centers across the country which are involved in the management and diagnosis of rare diseases.

The Oct.13 evening show will highlight both the men’s and women’s collections according to a statement from Ralph Lauren Corp. No further details were revealed except to say the fashion experience will be uniquely Ralph Lauren.

The Huntington Library Art Museum and Botanical Gardens as it is formally called encompasses 120 acres in the tony suburb of San Marino and comprise the former estate of railroad baron Henry Huntington and his wife Arabella. The vast botanical collection spanning the complex includes a Japanese garden a Chinese garden a large rose garden and the Shakespeare garden with plants cultivated in England during William Shakespeare’s time.

The former Huntington mansion built at the beginning of the 20th century is now filled with artwork including Thomas Gainsborough’s “The Blue Boy” and Thomas Lawrence’s “Pinkie.”

Lauren’s last fashion show in March was held in a museum too. At the Museum of Modern Art in New York a gallery was transformed into a replica of the designer’s Fifth Avenue apartment and guests were invited to see his fall 2022 collection. It was Lauren’s first show in three years.

Ralph Lauren has been in the news lately for creating three different bridal gowns for Jennifer Lopez who in a more formal second wedding ceremony this month married fellow actor Ben Affleck at his 87-acre compound on Hampton Island Preserve in Georgia.

Southern California in recent years has been the site for several designer fashion shows that normally would have taken place in New York or Europe. The temperate climate is perfect for outdoor runway shows. The number of Hollywood celebrities who live in the area make for a star-filled audience.

In May Louis Vuitton designer Nicholas Ghesquière chose the seaside Salk Institute in La Jolla California as the location to unveil his resort 2023 collection capturing stunning looks among the Brutalist architecture highlighted at sunset. That same month Dior’s men’s artistic director Kim Jones closed down part of Venice Beach to show the brand’s men’s resort collection.

Last November Gucci closed off part of Hollywood Boulevard and staged a show in the street in front of the 1920s-era El Capitan theater unveiling the Italian company’s spring 2022 rtw collection.

Walking the show were celebrities including Jared Leto Macauley Culkin and Naomi Campbell. In the audience were entertainment stars including Billie Eilish Diane Keaton Salma Hayek Serena Williams Tracee Ellis Ross and Sienna Miller.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL2VuZ2xpc2guZWxwYWlzLmNvbS9jdWx0dXJlLzIwMjItMDgtMjUvamVubmlmZXItbG9wZXotYW5kLXJhbHBoLWxhdXJlbi10aGUtbW9zdC1zdXJwcmlzaW5nLXVuaW9uLW9mLWpsb3Mtd2VkZGluZy1kYXkuaHRtbNIBjwFodHRwczovL2VuZ2xpc2guZWxwYWlzLmNvbS9jdWx0dXJlLzIwMjItMDgtMjUvamVubmlmZXItbG9wZXotYW5kLXJhbHBoLWxhdXJlbi10aGUtbW9zdC1zdXJwcmlzaW5nLXVuaW9uLW9mLWpsb3Mtd2VkZGluZy1kYXkuaHRtbD9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lauren and Lopez: The most surprising union of JLO’s wedding day,"Jennifer Lopez has revealed the three dresses she wore at her second wedding to Ben Affleck on her official newsletter On The JLo. The first dress worn during the 45-minute ceremony features a high neck and voluminous hand-sewn ruffled skirt. The singer then changed into a dress with a plunging pearl-lined neckline. And to end the night she wore a third dress with mermaid silhouette adorned with Swarovski crystals on the back and neckline. All of them were designed by the same person: Ralph Lauren.

The designer and the singer both come from humble origins. The two grew up in the New York borough of the Bronx and both embody the American dream: rising up from their humble backgrounds to achieve global success in their respective careers. Ralph Lauren is the son of Jewish immigrants and as a child only wanted to have his own closet where he could arrange his shoes as he says in the 2019 HBO documentary Very Ralph. But his talent for design – inspired by the style of movie stars such as Marlon Brandon and Paul Newman – saw him go from selling ties to heading a fashion empire.

The second dress worn by Jennifer Lopez on her wedding day. On The J. Lo

Jennifer Lopez or JLO as she is also known professionally has worn Ralph Lauren designs on more than one occasion notably at the 2019 CFDA Awards where she picked up the Fashion Icon award in an orange two-piece created by the designer and at the 2021 Met Gala which paid tribute to American fashion.

But Lopez’s decision to wear Ralph Lauren on her wedding day has raised some eyebrows considering the scandals the brand has faced and its association with wealthy white Americans. While the singer and actress is proud of her journey from the hood to the red carpet Ralph Lauren has been embraced by the WASP – White Anglo-Saxon Protestant – community.

The third dress worn by Jennifer Lopez on her wedding day. On The J. Lo

The designer changed his Jewish surname Lifshitz to Lauren to make it more American sounding. The designer was again the center of controversy when former first lady Melania Trump wore one of his designs at the investiture ceremony of Donald Trump.

When asked about why Ralph Lauren changed his surname in Very Ralph Jerry Lauren his brother and executive vice-president of menswear said: “A lot of people thought that Ralph had changed his name because he wanted to be more WASPy. Absolutely not true. I am the person who created the name change. Throughout life having a namelike Lifshitz was a tough thing to live with. [...] There was never a moment when I want to escape my origins but I said: ‘Lenny and Ralph I want to tell you something.’I’d like for us to change our names.’”

In regard to the Ralph Lauren jumpsuit that Melanie Trump worse to celebrate the 2016 election results the designer said she had bought the garment without informing him. The former first lady however wore a Ralph Lauren blue suit custom-made by the company for Trump’s inauguration. Twitter users lashed out against the designer for dressing the Republican leader’s wife with the hashtag #BoycottRalphLauren quickly becoming viral.

Despite these controversies JLO opted to wear Ralph Lauren on her second wedding day on August 21. The singer’s support is a sign that the designer has been able to distant himself from the accusations of classism and move closer to the notion of the American dream embodied by them both.

The pair held a wedding celebration for friends and family this weekend after making things official last month.

More than 20 years after they became engaged the first time around the Afflecks chose a low-key ceremony at a chapel in Las Vegas in July and then held a huge celebration at their Georgia estate over the weekend.

And of course it goes without saying that Lopez pulled out all the stops when it came to her wedding dresses wearing more than a few very special gowns.

Below we detail everything we know about Lopez's beautiful wedding looks.

The Alexander McQueen dress

Although the setting was extremely low-key and relaxed for the couple's surprise Las Vegas wedding there was nothing toned down about Lopez's wedding outfit.

In images which have been shared on social media by various members of her glam team Lopez can be seen to be wearing two different dresses during the celebrations the first of which was a sleeveless white design by Alexander McQueen.

The Zuhair Murad gown

Lopez later changed into an off-the-shoulder lace gown by Zuhair Murad which featured a fishtail train a corseted bodice and a matching veil. Sharing details with fans on her newsletter Lopez explained that the dress was from a movie she starred in.

""So with the best witnesses you could ever imagine a dress from an old movie and a jacket from Ben’s closet we read our own vows in the little chapel and gave one another the rings we’ll wear for the rest of our lives"" the singer said. ""They even had Bluetooth for a (short) march down the aisle. But in the end it was the best possible wedding we could have imagined. One we dreamed of long ago and one made real (in the eyes of the state Las Vegas a pink convertible and one another) at very very long last.""

She added: ""When love is real the only thing that matters in marriage is one another and the promise we make to love care understand be patient loving and good to one another. We had that. And so much more. Best night of our lives.""

Lopez signed the newsletter with her new name: ""Mrs. Jennifer Lynn Affleck"".

The Ralph Lauren gowns

For the couple's Georgia celebration – which saw them welcome all their closest friends and family to their Riceboro estate – Lopez wore not one but three custom gowns by Ralph Lauren.

The first dress was ""a handkerchief wedding gown reimagined as a turtleneck column dress with the addition of a dramatic ruffle hem"" Ralph Lauren's team explained of the design adding: ""Over 1000 hand-cut handkerchiefs and 500 meters of fabric were cut into ruffles and attached by hand creating a voluminous romantic skirt. The intricately constructed sleeve is inset with a cascading ruffle draped from the back of the turtleneck to the shoulder to create a romantic heritage-inspired sensibility.""

Later on Lopez changed into a dramatic chandelier pearl gown which was adorned with thousands of cascading strings of pearls.

""30 artisans worked across 700 hours to hand embroider the gown with micro-pleats of silk tulle tiny pearl embellishments and Swarovski crystal.""

The third and final gown was a sleek mermaid silhouette with a keyhole neckline embellished with Swarovski crystals of varying shapes and shades of white and is completed with a full skirt and topped with an organza overlay.

And Lopez of course accessorised with plenty of impressive jewels. For her walk down the aisle the singer wore plenty of Mikimoto pearl jewellery including a statement ring and earrings and for the reception she added two million dollars' worth of Samer Halimeh diamonds.

In a Thursday update to clients Sarugaser reiterated his “Outperform” rating on Perimeter saying the company is priming the market for the launch of its Artificial Intelligence-enabled imaging system in 2024.

Perimeter Medical based in Toronto and Dallas Texas is commercializing its optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging systems for use by surgeons radiologists and pathologists to see microscopic tissue structures using ultra-high resolution and real-time imaging tools. Perimeter’s FDA-cleared S-Series OCT system provides cross-sectional real-time margin visualization of one to two millimetres below the surface of an excised tissue specimen to help surgeons ensure that all cancer has been removed during surgery thereby reducing the rates of re-operation. Perimeter’s B-Series OCT with ImgAssist AI which was granted an FDA Breakthrough Designation in 2021 uses proprietary predictive algorithms to improve the efficacy of margin assessment during surgery.

Perimeter released its second quarter 2022 financials on Wednesday showing revenue of $19500 with a net loss of $0.4 million. The company had cash and equivalents at the end of the Q2 of $45.0 million with $0.2 million of debt.

Perimeter placed its first commercial S-Series OCT during the quarter a placement at the Pavilion Surgery Center in California to be used in breast conservation and other surgeries representing the first commercial use of the S-Series in a standalone ambulatory setting. Management updated its guidance on full 2022 installations and is now calling for between ten and 20 placements versus the previous forecast of between 15 and 20.

Meanwhile Perimeter is continuing with patient recruitment for its multi-centre randomized two-arm pivotal clinical trial on the B-Series OCT combined with ImgAssist AI Software with seven of the eight clinical sites now activated. Management said it looks to gather data from about 330 patients with enrolment now to be completed in early 2023.

Summing up the quarter Perimeter CEO Jeremy Sobotta said the sales cycle has been lengthened on the S-Series even as commercialization is proceeding very well.

“We remain highly confident about the market reception of our technology including a pipeline where the average deal size is growing and exceeding our expectations. However this creates a lengthened sales cycle as we navigate the broader procurement processes and as such we have expanded the range for our anticipated commercial installations due to that uncertainty” Sobotta said in a press release.

“With a strong balance sheet and our driven team Perimeter is well positioned to execute on our goal of transforming cancer surgery by advancing the standard of care improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs with the use of our innovative technologies” he said.

Tallying up the timelines for the B-Series trial and regulatory review Sarugaser said there’s likely to be one quarter of post-trial data analysts followed by two quarters of regulatory review. That would mean FDA clearance is now likely to be in the late fourth quarter 2023 or early first quarter 2024 compared to the previous estimate at late third quarter 2023 to early fourth quarter 2023. Sarugaser said that leaves Perimeter with about 18 months to prime the market for the adoption of its AI-enabled B-Series device.

“In its FY21 corporate update PINK guided toward 15-20 Perimeter S-Series OCT installations by the end of CY2022 (and reiterated during 1Q22 earnings) aiming to place the technology with US [Key Opinion Leaders] at leading breast cancer hospitals. PINK expects these early KOL installs to motivate the adoption and sales of its next-gen B-Series device upon approval (~4Q23/1Q24) seeding power users that would appreciate the performance lift of AI guidance and that would serve as advocates and trainers for new adopters of the device” Sarugaser wrote.

“PINK’s early adopters are already on the conference circuit discussing experiences with the S-Series; PINK’s first commercial user indicates that she reduced lumpectomy re-excision rates from 25 per cent to zero per cent during the first half-year using the device. PINK’s pivotal trial of the B-Series OCT will serve to provide physicians the large-population data they lean on when making technology adoption decisions” he said.

As for his forecast Sarugaser is calling for Perimeter to generate full 2022 revenue of $1 million with his EV/Revenue multiple going from 1425.0x in 2021 to 199.5x in 2022.

With a current market capitalization of $144 million Perimeter’s share price has had a 52-week range of $1.49-$5.20. Year-to-date PINK is currently down about 54 per cent.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmp1c3RqYXJlZC5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8yNC9qYXNvbi1tb21vYS1oZXJhLWhpbG1hci1jZWxlYnJhdGUtc2Vlcy1maW5hbC1zZWFzb24tcHJlbWllcmUtaW4tbGEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jason Momoa & Hera Hilmar Celebrate 'See's Final Season Premiere in LA,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.justjared.com/2022/08/24/jason-momoa-hera-hilmar-celebrate-sees-final-season-premiere-in-la/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmp1c3RqYXJlZC5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8yNC9qYXNvbi1tb21vYS1oZXJhLWhpbG1hci1jZWxlYnJhdGUtc2Vlcy1maW5hbC1zZWFzb24tcHJlbWllcmUtaW4tbGEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Ampere is the current GPU architecture that powers Nvidia’s RTX 30-series GPUs after Turing debuted with the first RTX cards in 2018. Nvidia is now expected to detail its Lovelace GPU architecture at GTC 2022 in September with CEO Jensen Huang hinting at an announce during the company’s recent earnings call.

“We’ll get through this over the next few months and go into next year with our new architecture” said Huang while discussing a slowdown in gaming GPU demand. “I look forward to telling you more about it at GTC next month.”

A new GPU architecture announce doesn’t mean we’ll see RTX 40-series GPUs immediately though. Nvidia first unveiled its Ampere architecture for data centers before launching its RTX 30-series cards for consumers months later. There’s always a slight delay between an architecture announce and consumer GPU launch. With the RTX 20-series that was just a week so it doesn’t necessarily mean we’ll be waiting months.

Either way rumors continue to suggest Nvidia is working on RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 GPUs. The monster RTX 4090 was originally rumored as a July release and it could offer a big performance boost over existing RTX 3090 and even RTX 3090 Ti cards. Huang also hinted that current-gen RTX 30-series GPUs will live alongside next-gen ones.

The reason RTX 30-series and 40-series will likely co-exist is because Nvidia has built too many GPUs. It’s currently being forced to adjust retail pricing due to excess inventory and we’ve seen RTX 30-series cards appearing at MSRP recently following years of prices being hiked 2-3x by resellers. The crypto crash has affected GPU demand and the excess inventory makes it more difficult to predict when Nvidia is likely to actually put its RTX 40-series cards on shelves.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vbnZpZGlhLXJldmVhbC1kZXRhaWxzLXJ0eC00MDAwLWdwdXMtc2VwdGVtYmVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia Will Reveal More Details About Its RTX 4000 GPUs In September,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vbnZpZGlhLXJldmVhbC1kZXRhaWxzLXJ0eC00MDAwLWdwdXMtc2VwdGVtYmVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjZ2FtZXNuLmNvbS9udmlkaWEvcnR4LTQwMDAtcmV2ZWFsLWV2ZW50LXBvdGVudGlhbGx5LXNlcHRlbWJlci0yMDIy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia RTX 4000 reveal event potentially set for next month,"GeForce fans rejoice as it looks like Nvidia is gearing up to reveal to potentially reveal its next generation RTX 4000 graphics card series very soon. So if you’re keen to learn more about team green’s Lovelace architecture as soon as possible we’d suggest keeping your calendar as free as possible for the next month or so.

During a recent earnings call Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang teased what sounds like plans for a potential RTX 4000 reveal event. Huang began by describing current market conditions as a “sudden slowdown in consumer demand” which has led to a wave of RTX 3000 GPU price cuts. However he remains adamant that “the fundamentals of gaming are strong” and that the company will “go into next year with [its] new architecture.”

Huang concludes by announcing that he will share more details on Lovelace the microarchitecture powering RTX 4000 graphics cards on September 20 at GTC 2022. The CEO promises to share “new advances of RTX reinventing 3D graphics and gaming.”

Hold onto your butts as it’s beginning to sound like we’re on the cusp of a new generation of the best graphics cards which should begin with the RTX 4090.

NVIDIA CEO On Next-Gen GeForce RTX 40 GPUs Launch: ""We do have exciting new next-generation coming"" Announcement in September?

NVIDIA's second quarter this year has been brutal with gaming revenue dropping down to 44% sequentially & 33% annually. You can read the full earning report by our Finance team here but what we are going to talk about is the fact that NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang has confirmed that their next-generation GPUs are inbound.

NVIDIA confirmed that its price adjustment on existing graphics cards came in a bid to get rid of excess inventory to make room for the next generation of products. Jensen states that the next-generation graphics cards and the GPU architecture is going to be really exciting which you can read from the statement provided below:

Our strategy is to reduce the sell-in -- reduce the sell-in this quarter next quarter to let channel inventory correct. Obviously we’re off the highs and the macro condition turned sharply worse. And so our first strategy is to reduce sell-in in the next couple of quarters to correct channel inventory. We’ve also instituted programs to price position our current products to prepare for next-generation products. Ampere is the most popular GPU we’ve ever created. It is in the top 15 most popular gaming GPUs on Steam. And it remains the best GPUs in the world and it will be very successful for some time. However we do have exciting new next-generation coming and it’s going to be layered on top of that. And so we’ve taken -- we’ve done two things. We’ve reduced sell-in to let channel inventory correct and we’ve implemented programs with our partners to price position the products in the channel in preparation for our next generation. All of this we anticipate were working towards a path to being in a good shape going into next year. Oka? So that’s what our game plan is. NVIDIA CEO - Jensen Huang (Q2 2023 Earnings Call)

What's more important is the fact that Jensen also gave us a hint that we can hear more about the next-generation gaming GPU architecture by next month at GTC 2022. The next iteration of NVIDIA GTC is going to take place on 19th September and last till 22nd September while the CEO keynote is expected to take place on 20th September.

In Gaming our partners and ecosystem are responding to a sudden slowdown in consumer demand and correcting channel inventory. Still the fundamentals of gaming are strong. We’ll get through this over the next few months and go into next year with our new architecture. I look forward to telling you more about it at GTC next month. I look forward to next month’s GTC conference where we will share new advances of RTX reinventing 3D graphics and gaming. NVIDIA CEO - Jensen Huang (Q2 2023 Earnings Call)

So it looks like we are more or less going to get an official to unveil next month in September. This will definitely not be a launch event for the next-generation GeForce RTX 40 series lineup but more so an announcement/unveil. We definitely look forward to what NVIDIA has in store for the gaming community.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2NvbXB1dGluZy9udmlkaWEtY2VvLXJldmVhbHMtdXBjb21pbmctcnR4LTQwMDAtbmV3cy_SAVZodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaWdpdGFsdHJlbmRzLmNvbS9jb21wdXRpbmcvbnZpZGlhLWNlby1yZXZlYWxzLXVwY29taW5nLXJ0eC00MDAwLW5ld3MvP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia CEO promises RTX 30 price cuts as RTX 40 is just around the corner,"It’s good news all around for Nvidia enthusiasts today because Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has teased some exciting updates that are just around the corner.

We now know for a fact that the company is planning to reveal more information about its upcoming Ada Lovelace RTX 4000-series of GPUs. Moreover current-gen GPUs might soon see another drop in price.

We’ve come a long way from the dark depths of the GPU shortage. Graphics cards are currently in abundance and now the CEO of Nvidia has confirmed this himself during the company’s earnings call for the second quarter of 2022. Huang explained that the company now faces a tough task: reducing the oversupply of current-gen RTX 3000-series graphics cards before it moves on to the next generation.

Huang confirmed that Nvidia has an “excess inventory” of Ampere graphics cards. The inventory itself could be dealt with but the pricing doesn’t work in the favor of the GPUs. While GPU prices have been dropping in many parts of the world RTX 3000-series graphics cards are still very expensive — this is especially true for high-end models like the RTX 3080 and the RTX 3090.

According to Huang Nvidia is working with its partners to improve the pricing of these GPUs. However he didn’t elaborate on what kind of price cuts we can expect or which parts of the world are going to see a change. So far the U.S. market has seen some discounts on the best GPUs but that trend has been slow to spread throughout the rest of the globe.

“Our first strategy is to reduce sell-in in the next couple of quarters to correct channel inventory. We’ve also instituted programs to price position our current products to prepare for next-generation products” said Huang during the earnings call.

The Nvidia CEO also noted that Ampere has been the most popular GPU the company has ever created. Because of that Nvidia expects it to remain successful for quite some time and rightfully so. If the company can successfully carry out price cuts many users will still continue buying RTX 3000-series GPUs instead of spending what will likely be a huge amount of money on RTX 4000-series GPUs.

This brings us to the second exciting bit of information that Huang shared with the public: Nvidia seems close to revealing some tangible information about the RTX 4000 graphics cards. So far most of what we know comes from rumors but Huang promised to tell us more about it soon saying “I look forward to next month’s GTC conference where we will share new advances of RTX reinventing 3D graphics and gaming.”

GTC 2022 is scheduled to start September 19 and end September 22. This means we’re less than a month away from an official reveal of the next generation of Nvidia graphics cards.

The Federal Reserve System is the central bank of the United States.

It performs five general functions to promote the effective operation of the U.S. economy and more generally the public interest. The Federal Reserve

The Decentralized System Structure and Its Philosophy

In establishing the Federal Reserve System the United States was divided geographically into 12 Districts each with a separately incorporated Reserve Bank. District boundaries were based on prevailing trade regions that existed in 1913 and related economic considerations so they do not necessarily coincide with state lines.

Twelve Federal Reserve Districts operate independently but with supervision Federal Reserve District boundaries are based on economic considerations; the Districts operate independently but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.

As originally envisioned each of the 12 Reserve Banks was intended to operate independently from the other Reserve Banks. Variation was expected in discount rates--the interest rate that commercial banks were charged for borrowing funds from a Reserve Bank. The setting of a separately determined discount rate appropriate to each District was considered the most important tool of monetary policy at that time. The concept of national economic policymaking was not well developed and the impact of open market operations--purchases and sales of U.S. government securities--on policymaking was less significant.

As the nation's economy became more integrated and more complex through advances in technology communications transportation and financial services the effective conduct of monetary policy began to require increased collaboration and coordination throughout the System. This was accomplished in part through revisions to the Federal Reserve Act in 1933 and 1935 that together created the modern-day Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).

The Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 (Monetary Control Act) introduced an even greater degree of coordination among Reserve Banks with respect to the pricing of financial services offered to depository institutions. There has also been a trend among Reserve Banks to centralize or consolidate many of their financial services and support functions and to standardize others. Reserve Banks have become more efficient by entering into intra-System service agreements that allocate responsibilities for services and functions that are national in scope among each of the 12 Reserve Banks.

The U.S. Approach to Central Banking

The framers of the Federal Reserve Act purposely rejected the concept of a single central bank. Instead they provided for a central banking ""system"" with three salient features: (1) a central governing Board (2) a decentralized operating structure of 12 Reserve Banks and (3) a combination of public and private characteristics.

Although parts of the Federal Reserve System share some characteristics with private-sector entities the Federal Reserve was established to serve the public interest.

There are three key entities in the Federal Reserve System: the Board of Governors the Federal Reserve Banks (Reserve Banks) and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The Board of Governors an agency of the federal government that reports to and is directly accountable to Congress provides general guidance for the System and oversees the 12 Reserve Banks.

Within the System certain responsibilities are shared between the Board of Governors in Washington D.C. whose members are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate and the Federal Reserve Banks and Branches which constitute the System's operating presence around the country. While the Federal Reserve has frequent communication with executive branch and congressional officials its decisions are made independently.

The Three Key Federal Reserve Entities

The Federal Reserve Board of Governors (Board of Governors) the Federal Reserve Banks (Reserve Banks) and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) make decisions that help promote the health of the U.S. economy and the stability of the U.S. financial system.

Three key entities serving the public interest The framers of the Federal Reserve Act developed a central banking system that would broadly represent the public interest.

Other Significant Entities Contributing to Federal Reserve Functions

Two other groups play important roles in the Federal Reserve System's core functions:

depository institutions--banks thrifts and credit unions; and Federal Reserve System advisory committees which make recommendations to the Board of Governors and to the Reserve Banks regarding the System's responsibilities.

Depository Institutions

Depository institutions offer transaction or checking accounts to the public and may maintain accounts of their own at their local Federal Reserve Banks. Depository institutions are required to meet reserve requirements--that is to keep a certain amount of cash on hand or in an account at a Reserve Bank based on the total balances in the checking accounts they hold.

Depository institutions that have higher balances in their Reserve Bank account than they need to meet reserve requirements may lend to other depository institutions that need those funds to satisfy their own reserve requirements. This rate influences interest rates asset prices and wealth exchange rates and thereby aggregate demand in the economy. The FOMC sets a target for the federal funds rate at its meetings and authorizes actions called open market operations to achieve that target.

Advisory Councils

Five advisory councils assist and advise the Board on matters of public policy.

Federal Advisory Council (FAC). This council established by the Federal Reserve Act comprises 12 representatives of the banking industry. The FAC ordinarily meets with the Board four times a year as required by law. Annually each Reserve Bank chooses one person to represent its District on the FAC. FAC members customarily serve three one-year terms and elect their own officers. Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council (CDIAC). The CDIAC was originally established by the Board of Governors to obtain information and views from thrift institutions (savings and loan institutions and mutual savings banks) and credit unions. More recently its membership has expanded to include community banks. Like the FAC the CDIAC provides the Board of Governors with firsthand insight and information about the economy lending conditions and other issues. Model Validation Council. This council was established by the Board of Governors in 2012 to provide expert and independent advice on its process to rigorously assess the models used in stress tests of banking institutions. Stress tests are required under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The council is intended to improve the quality of stress tests and thereby strengthen confidence in the stress-testing program. Community Advisory Council (CAC). This council was formed by the Federal Reserve Board in 2015 to offer diverse perspectives on the economic circumstances and financial services needs of consumers and communities with a particular focus on the concerns of low- and moderate-income populations. The CAC complements the FAC and CDIAC whose members represent depository institutions. The CAC meets semiannually with members of the Board of Governors. The 15 CAC members serve staggered three-year terms and are selected by the Board through a public nomination process. Insurance Policy Advisory Committee (IPAC). This council was established at the Board of Governors in 2018 by section 211(b) of the Economic Growth Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act. The IPAC provides information advice and recommendations to the Board on international insurance capital standards and other insurance issues.

Federal Reserve Banks also have their own advisory committees. Perhaps the most important of these are committees that advise the Banks on agricultural small business and labor matters. The Federal Reserve Board solicits the views of each of these committees biannually.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzd2lyZS5jYS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2tpd2V0aW5vaGstY29uc29saWRhdGVzLW1vbnRuZXktYXNzZXRzLWFuZC1wbGFucy1pbmNyZWFzZWQtbW9udG5leS1kcmlsbGluZy1wcm9ncmFtLTgwMTM2MDg4NC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kiwetinohk consolidates Montney assets and plans increased Montney drilling program,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.newswire.ca', port=443): Read timed out.

“This is totally outrageous. This is unbelievable-” shouted Clark County resident Ed Uehling.

“Mr. Uehling stop. This is my meeting and Commissioner Miller's meeting” Clark County Commissioner Marilyn Kirkpatrick shouted back.



Here’s the current trash pickup situation:



Right now most residents living in unincorporated Clark County have one trash bin one recycling bin and a blue container.

RELATED |

For decades Republic Services picked it all up twice a week for $16.21/month.



However in other parts of the valley most residents have one trash bin and one recycling bin and Republic Services picks up once a week for $16.21/month.

Here’s the change: Come September 1 Republic Services wants to make waste pickup service the same for all residents in Southern Nevada.

That means residents in unincorporated portions of the county would have to choose if they want to keep their trash bins or blue container.

Republic Services will no longer pick up trash in unincorporated Clark County twice a week unless a resident pays an extra fee for the bin and the extra weekly pickup.

“We have chickens my neighbors have horses but we’re not businesses. So $50 to some -- extra a month -- might not be a lot. Especially right now with inflation and everything it seems like a terrible time to raise the prices. We're just having animals and we need the two pickups” explained unincorporated Clark County resident Heidi Prieto.

“We send a fleet of trucks to your area cleaning up Monday’s trash up and down the block. That second pick up is a truck that’s just gonna go to your house and there’s a cost for that"" explained Steven DeStefano Republic Services representative.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt0bnYuY29tL25ld3MvY3V0LWJhY2tzLWluLXRyYXNoLXNlcnZpY2VzLWNvbWluZy1zb29uLWZvci1yZXNpZGVudGlhbC1jdXN0b21lcnMtY2xhcmstY291bnR50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trash services for unincorporated Clark County customers will soon change,"LAS VEGAS (KTNV) — Effective Sept. 1 Republic Services' residential customers will see cut-backs in their trash services.

According to Republic Services residential customers in the unincorporated County who have had both a wheeled plastic cart for solid waste and a metal small container with a capacity of 1 2 or 3 yards must choose which to use going forward or incur an additional charge.

The additional charge will be approximately $50 per month.

Once-a-week pickup of recyclables in a wheeled plastic cart and every-other-week pickup of bulky items is continuing at no additional charge.

The monthly fee in unincorporated Clark County is $16.21 excluding the costs of trash can rental.

Read the original story here.

Pearl Walker lives right next to the Interstate 55 exit on the south side of Memphis. Every day she watches over 100 rust-red trucks loaded with toxic coal ash from the nearby coal plant barrel past on their way to a local municipal landfill.

The landfill is the final resting place for 3.5 million cubic yards of toxic coal ash — enough to fill two and a half Empire State Buildings — from the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) Allen Fossil Plant. For decades residents have dealt with air pollution from the plant. When federal rules mandated the plant’s coal ash ponds had to close residents made clear they wanted the ash removed from their community.

This story is part of a 12-part investigation by the Chicago Investigative Project in the graduate program at the Medill School at Northwestern University.

But even as TVA held public meetings and told residents it was considering various options the federal agency was already moving forward with its plans to haul coal ash to the South Shelby Landfill in South Memphis documents obtained through a public records request showed. Coal-ash-laden trucks will traverse local streets for at least 8 years under TVA’s plans continuing a legacy of environmental injustice and lack of accountability as many see it.

Walker is concerned about diesel emissions from the trucks and the potential for coal ash to spill out in a crash. As an environmental justice advocate and long-time resident of the neighborhood known as Whitehaven Walker feels disrespected by the agencies and elected officials who approved this plan.

Toxic coal ash is stored at more than 700 sites nationwide. Groundwater has been contaminated at the majority of sites according to environmental groups’ analysis of testing data reported by utility and power companies. Many of the pits are being closed leaving the ash in place to the outrage of environmental activists. TVA the federal utility that ran the Allen plant for six decades decided to remove the ash from the Allen Plant and bring it to a landfill — generally considered the most environmentally safe option. But nationwide minority and low-income neighborhoods are more likely to find municipal and hazardous waste landfills in their communities.

TVA ultimately narrowed its options to seven landfills: the North Shelby and South Shelby landfills in Tennessee the Tunica Landfill in Mississippi the Arrowhead Landfill in Alabama the Taylor County Disposal Landfill in Georgia the Lee County Landfill in South Carolina and the Laraway Recycling and Disposal Facility in Illinois.

“[The process] lacks integrity and accountability it is taking place but we don’t if and or how we’re being compromised.” Pearl Walker South Memphis resident

The seven sites had one thing in common: all were located in low-income and predominantly minority communities.

Arrowhead Landfill located in Uniontown Alabama — a highly impoverished Black community — had already received 4 million cubic yards of coal ash from the TVA’s Kingston Fossil Plant coal ash spill in 2008.

TVA said it might take coal ash to the Tennessee or Mississippi landfills by truck; it could use trains for the Alabama Georgia and South Carolina landfills; and the Illinois landfill could be reached by barge. Memphis residents knew they didn’t want the trucks or the coal ash in their community but they felt they had little say in the process.

“[The process] lacks integrity and accountability it is taking place but we don’t know if and or how we’re being compromised” Walker said. “The process can’t be trusted.”

‘Slow killers’

TVA founded under a New Deal plan to help supply cheap electricity and jobs in the rural South once ran 13 coal-powered plants. Eight have since closed. Of the 13 plants Allen was the only one located in a predominantly Black community.

Memphis is home to 66 facilities that release toxic pollution according to the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Toxic Release Inventory. Half of those facilities are located in South Memphis including the Allen Plant an oil refinery and the Memphis Defense Depot a military chemical waste center.

Marquita Bradshaw 48 has lived in South Memphis her whole life. Many of the toxic facilities were located near Bradshaw’s childhood home and school.

“The refinery was spewing out stuff where you could see it actually on the leaves the particulate matter. You [could] see the black dust on the leaves on the houses on the cars covering the ground” Bradshaw said.

While walking to school she remembers her skin would itch she thinks from the contaminated air. Bradshaw still remembers the smell: putrid like burning acid or oil.

Bradshaw has had reproductive abnormalities since she was 21 years old. She said her 67-year-old mother has kidney failure and is waiting for a transplant. Last year her best friend since the seventh grade died from endocrine diseases and repeated problems with strokes and diabetes. Bradshaw who serves as the environmental justice chair of the Sierra Club’s Chickasaw group and is the executive director of the environmental justice group Sowing Justice blames toxic industries and fossil fuels for these health issues.

“The injustices our communities are experiencing is slow violence.” Justin J. Pearson South Memphis resident and co-founder of Memphis Community Against Pollution

“This type of thing affects all of us” Bradshaw said. “We have one environment. It’s not like there are actual barriers if [the coal ash] fly off a truck when they are loading it up.”

Residents of South Memphis are more likely than the national average to develop cancer according to a report from ProPublica. Shelby County which includes Memphis received an F grade for air quality on the American Lung Association’s “State of the Air” report in 2022.

Today the Allen Plant’s ash pits are left with 3.5 million cubic yards of toxic coal ash enough to cover 164 football fields. Stored for years in unlined pits this coal ash has contaminated groundwater with arsenic at 350 times the safe limits for water according to groundwater monitoring reports filed by the company. Long term exposure to arsenic from drinking water can cause cancer and skin lesions and is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease diabetes and cognitive impairment.

“It’s killing people that’s what I am trying to tell folks” said Justin J. Pearson lifelong resident of South Memphis. “The injustices our communities are experiencing is slow violence. It’s slow lynching of Black folk and poor folk for the profit of the TVA and other corporations.”

Parade of trucks

At the Allen Plant 10-wheeled trucks from V McGee Trucking Inc. are loaded up with coal ash before they head to the landfill across town. After about seven miles on interstate 55 they take the Shelby Drive exit through the Capleville Whitehaven and Boxtown neighborhoods a predominantly Black community full of colorful bungalows and friendly neighbors.

On Malone Road leading to the South Shelby Landfill there are a dozen homes one church and a couple industrial plants.

According to the TVA trucks will transport 120 loads of 17 cubic yards of coal ash to the landfill each day 210 days per year. The trucks return to the Allen Plant after dropping off the waste totaling 240 trips per day through South Memphis. Additionally another fleet of trucks transports fill dirt from the nearby Boxtown neighborhood to the Allen Plant to replace the coal ash in the impoundment.

TVA acknowledged their plan would have significant impacts on noise traffic air quality safety and community cohesion for the next eight to ten years. However TVA did not assess those effects specifically on the South Memphis community which Amanda Garcia director of the Tennessee office of the Southern Environmental Law Center said is a critical step that is required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).

“[TVA] kind of brushed that aside like this is a temporary impact. But 10 years doesn’t feel very temporary to me” Garcia said.

Exposure to diesel exhaust can lead to serious health conditions like asthma respiratory illnesses and can worsen existing heart and lung diseases.

Since 2015 Memphis has been among the worst places to live if you have asthma according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.

The trucks are equipped with a fitted tarp cover to prevent fugitive coal ash dust from flying out according to TVA documents.

But Walker wonders what plans are in place if the trucks have an accident. She wants to know who is responsible if the coal ash spills.

“I’m deeply concerned because this is my family” said Pearson co-founder of Memphis Community Against Pollution. “We have 240 plus trucks going every day in the neighborhood for the next 10 years or so – [what does that do] to the air people are breathing.”

Trucks wait to enter the South Shelby Landfill. Twenty-seven acres of land at the disposal facility have been designated for the coal ash. The landfill is owned by Republic Services the waste company has handled coal ash disposal three times. Credit: Chloe Hilles

Lack of trust

In July 2021 TVA announced to Memphis City Council that they would proceed with removing the coal ash from the Allen Fossil Plant. At that time TVA said they were deciding between dumping the waste at South Shelby Landfill or the landfill in Tunica Mississippi.

Walker who serves as the Memphis coordinator for the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy and the Environmental Climate and Justice chair for the Memphis NAACP thought it was a “no brainer” that the ash would go to Tunica a more remote town with a total population of about 2000 compared to South Memphis’s population of 70000.

“They basically were already committed to this plan. And that’s an egregious harm under the National Environmental Policy Act and an egregious abuse of the trust and the responsibility of being a good neighbor in South Memphis.” Amanda Garcia director of the Southern Enviornmental Law Center’s Tennessee office

But at the time of that announcement TVA had already decided on the South Shelby Landfill unbeknownst to residents.

According to emails between the TVA and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation the plan for the Allen Plant cleanup project was decided in January 2021 six months before TVA notified Memphis City Council or the residents of their decision. Emails were obtained by the Southern Environmental Law Center through a public records request.

During those six months TVA misled city officials and the public by holding community input meetings as if a landfill decision was still being made. Republic Services the parent company of South Shelby Landfill had already been chosen by TVA for the excavation transportation and storage of the coal ash.

“They basically were already really committed to this plan” said Garcia. “And that’s an egregious harm under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and an egregious abuse of the trust and the responsibility of being a good neighbor in South Memphis.”

Most concerned residents didn’t learn until a virtual community meeting on Sept. 22 2021 that South Shelby Landfill would be the sole recipient of the Allen Plant’s coal ash – nine months after TVA had made the decision.

Over the past five years TVA hosted “40 public engagement events” according to TVA spokesperson Scott Brooks. Additionally the agency hosted two public meetings specifically about the plan for the Allen Plant coal ash removal.

Pearson said the virtual meeting was yet another instance of TVA moving forward without giving the community a say. “Providing updates versus where you’re engaging directly meaningfully with the community to help create a plan are really different things” he said.

Since November 2021 the Southern Environmental Law Center along with local Memphis environmental groups have demanded that TVA produce a new environmental impact statement that evaluates the specific environmental risks from trucking the coal ash through South Memphis for the next eight years. They say such a report is needed to comply with NEPA.

Garica said TVA could not adequately evaluate the impact of their decision without more input from residents.

“I’m a big believer in the idea that people who live most proximate to the problem are often the ones that have the best information and certainly the lived experience that should inform these big decisions that are going to affect their community for a decade” Garcia said.

A better choice

Documents obtained through the public comment period indicate that TVA could have chosen a plan proposed by a more experienced company that wouldn’t burden South Memphis residents with trucks.

The company Waste Connections had proposed a five-year plan to remove all the ash by rail. Waste Connections has been handling coal ash for seven years compared to Republic Services which has managed coal ash only three times according to testimony at a 2021 community meeting.

“How can the equivalent of putting 647 trucks on the road be safer than moving 11000 [coal ash] tons by one unit train?” asked Waste Connections’ letter to TVA.

TVA considered Waste Connections’ sites in the original 2020 landfill analysis but it was “eliminated because they did not meet the established criteria” said Brooks in an email.

Pearson said the community would have liked to know more about the options and have a say.

“We want to understand what the other alternatives were for TVA whether that be by rail or different routes or different locations for the coal ash to be dumped” said Pearson who sees TVA as “operating in this very clandestine corporate way.”

Pearson and Garcia believe that trucking the coal ash to South Shelby Landfill is the cheapest option for TVA. The federal agency refused to provide information about the total cost of trucking the coal ash to South Shelby Landfill. The entire Allen clean-up project is budgeted to cost $500 million according to the Associated Press.

Since TVA’s plan is set to take place over the next decade activists think that alternatives to South Shelby Landfill can still be considered. Pearson proposed looking at an equitable redistribution of the coal ash based on how the electricity from the Allen Plant was distributed to the city of Memphis.

“Now the people who are most vulnerable are the ones who are going to be suffering” Pearson said. “That’s not justice.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9hbWVyaWNhLXRyYXNoLWZsb3ctaXNudC1zaWduYWxpbmctcmVjZXNzaW9uLWNlby0xNjQxMjY0MzMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,America's trash flow isn't signaling a recession CEO explains,"The U.S. economy has been giving off mixed signals lately leading some to consider unusual indicators including men's underwear champagne sales and even trash.

""I would say no"" Republic Services CEO and President Jon Vander Ark said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above) when asked if trash demand signaled the economy is in a recession.

""We are supply constrained right now — our demand is incredibly strong across all markets"" Vander Ark added. ""And we see that from the consumer all the way to industrial and large national accounts. The demand is very very strong.""

Despite a challenging economic environment in 2022 the waste disposal industry has continued to see strong growth.

On August 4 Republic Services reported total revenue growth of 21% in the second quarter compared to a year ago as the trash giant expanded through acquisitions and organic growth.

""We've never grown as fast as we have from a volume standpoint and our outlook for the remainder of the year is very very positive"" Vander Ark said.

Republic stock (RSG) reached an all-time high of $147.94 on August 17 while competitor Waste Management (WM) momentarily ascended to its own high of $175.82 during the same trading session.

Growth of the 'sustainability story'

Recession or not the waste management industry is finding opportunities beyond trash and pivoting toward cleaner operations.

""We've gone from being a garbage company to really an environmental services and a sustainability company"" Vander Ark said.

Republic's acquisition of US Ecology (ECOL) which closed on May 2 paved the way for the waste handler to venture into the environmental services sector.

""Our 1000-plus salespeople are out every day trying to drive a recycling and sustainability story with our customers"" Vander Ark explained. ""And our take rates have gone up — we've grown that category faster than solid waste for the last decade.""

The push to increase recycling capabilities comes as companies across the board set objectives to decrease the scope of their carbon footprints and plastic usage. Many consumer-facing brands like Sprite Kraft Heinz and Blueland cleaning products have all started shifting away from traditional packaging.

According to Vander Ark these initiatives require waste management solutions that can extend the life cycle of materials.

""The more important topic is not all recycling is equal — an aluminum can requires an enormous amount of energy and has an enormous amount of value to be recycled"" Vander Ark specified. ""So we really think about aluminum fiber and cardboard and plastics is the primary things that have a really big value in the end market that we want to use to drive circularity.""

Story continues

Republic's goal for its plastics recycling facility in Las Vegas is to produce 100 million pounds of recycled plastic per year starting in 2023.

With recycling rates hovering around 50% in the U.S. Vander Ark highlighted the industry has a lot of runway ahead and noted that consumers and businesses should feel confident that what they recycle isn't diverted to the trash heap.

""I think very little is actually getting landfilled"" Vander Ark said. ""So you should feel good that if you're putting it into the container that it's going to end up in the right place.""

Republic has also invested heavily in other innovative ventures such as transmuting waste into energy.

""When you put garbage into a landfill it produces leachate which is a gray water and also methane"" Vander Ark said. ""And so we've now taken on 75 projects today and we've got another almost 60 in the pipeline to harness that methane and produce either electricity or renewable natural gas.""

James Johnson executive vice president and chief technology officer (CTO) of the California-based recruitment agency sat down with ITWC to discuss the award-winning features AI-powered matching technology and roadmap of the application.

Features time tracking and push notifications

After taking down its first marketing mobile app from the App Store in 2014 the company spearheaded the development of a second mobile app launched in 2019 aimed at expanding the avenues of engagement with its candidate population and simplifying the job search process. Candidates can search for jobs without an account or profile and if they create one they are matched with the best opportunities based on their requirements.

The ‘hook’ however Johnson said lies in the app’s time tracking tool allowing the company’s own contractors to record their work hours get paid and obtain their T4s using the app. “We have today more people using the app to record time than any other way” he said. The company also updated its legacy payroll system adding APIs to ensure connectivity via the app offered the rapid response time expected of a modern mobile app.

The app’s push notifications which let candidates know if they are being considered for a position have also been key to their success Johnson said in closing “the gray area in interactions we have with candidates”.

AI matching technology

Johnson said that the company worked to iteratively develop and improve their AI matching technology for the last seven years. He explained that there are three AI engines behind this matching technology:

Fit matching the candidates’ past experiences and skills against the job requirements and to similar successful candidates previously placed by the company resulting in a ‘double match’. Engagement determining how active the candidate is on their entire ecosystem (app website and partner platforms). Progress evaluating how far candidates are making it through the job search process; whether for example they talked to a client have been interviewed or signed paperwork.

Additionally the company abstains from capturing demographic data writing styles or people’s education (for example where they went to school) and developed a proprietary natural processing language (NLP) that allows them to “to take someone’s resume apart remove the context focusing instead on words or groups of words and by doing that also remove bias”.

Roadmap

In 2023 the company plans to implement the following features in the app:

Onboarding documents in the application to make it easier for candidates to start the job

Chat in app messaging and a chat bot to facilitate interactions

A mechanism to determine users’ time zones to provide them with more targeted guidance

Features to engage retain and help candidates move from assignment to assignment

Badges representing the skills candidates offer

“The combination of a simple user experience combined with both powerful job search and job matching capabilities that’s the thing that really stands out ” concluded Johnson. He added that the company is very proud and has “only just begun”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dzIuc3RhZmZpbmdpbmR1c3RyeS5jb20vUmVzZWFyY2gvUmVzZWFyY2gtUmVwb3J0cy9BbWVyaWNhcy9MYXJnZXN0LUZpbmFuY2UtQWNjb3VudGluZy1TdGFmZmluZy1GaXJtcy1pbi10aGUtVVMtMjAyMi1VcGRhdGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Largest Finance Accounting Staffing Firms in the US: 2022 Update,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', ConnectionResetError(10054, 'An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host', None, 10054, None)) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dzIuc3RhZmZpbmdpbmR1c3RyeS5jb20vUmVzZWFyY2gvUmVzZWFyY2gtUmVwb3J0cy9BbWVyaWNhcy9MYXJnZXN0LUZpbmFuY2UtQWNjb3VudGluZy1TdGFmZmluZy1GaXJtcy1pbi10aGUtVVMtMjAyMi1VcGRhdGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpZXJyYXN1bi5jb20vbmV3cy9lYXQtdGhpcy13ZWVrLWZpZnR5ZmlmdHktYnJld2luZy1jb21wYW55cy1oYWxmLW1vb24tYmF5LWJ1cmdlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EAT This Week: FiftyFifty Brewing Company's Half Moon Bay Burger,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sierrasun.com/news/eat-this-week-fiftyfifty-brewing-companys-half-moon-bay-burger/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpZXJyYXN1bi5jb20vbmV3cy9lYXQtdGhpcy13ZWVrLWZpZnR5ZmlmdHktYnJld2luZy1jb21wYW55cy1oYWxmLW1vb24tYmF5LWJ1cmdlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdydW5nZS5jb20vOTgwNDMzL3RoZS1qYW1lcy1kZWFuLW1vdmllLXRoYXQtcm9iZXJ0LWRlLW5pcm8tY29uc2lkZXJzLW9uZS1vZi1oaXMtdG9wLTMtZmF2b3JpdGVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The James Dean Movie That Robert De Niro Considers One Of His Top 3 Favorites,"The James Dean Movie That Robert De Niro Considers One Of His Top 3 Favorites

It's always a funny thing to ponder what inspires the most inspiring people in the world. Two-time Academy Award winner Robert De Niro has been acting since he dropped out of school to pursue the timeless trade at the ripe age of 16. Throughout the course of over half a century the ""Raging Bull"" star has built a legacy alongside some of the most legendary cinematic icons of our time and remains steadfast in his tireless work before the camera. ""One of the things about acting is it allows you to live other people's lives without having to pay the price"" he once said (via AZ Quotes). Whatever it is that makes the 79-year-old actor tick it seems to still be working for him.

For those among us who harbor a sensational passion for the arts there's always a catalyst — or series of them — we can point to that excites us enough to chase those dreams that we hope will one day become a reality. In an interview with fellow actor Kenneth Branagh De Niro noted those monuments in filmmaking that stand out to him above all others and keep him inspired as he continues to walk the road of movie magic. ""In America the actors I thought were the most interesting were James Dean Marlon Brando Montgomery Clift Kim Stanley and Greta Garbo"" he explained. He also revealed his top three favorite films — two of which feature Dean (per Far Out magazine).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdydW5nZS5jb20vOTc5Nzk4L3RoZS1yZWFsLXdhci10aGF0LWluc3BpcmVkLWhvdXNlLW9mLXRoZS1kcmFnb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Real War That Inspired House Of The Dragon,"The Real War That Inspired House Of The Dragon

George R. R. Martin has never been shy about naming his influences. For his ongoing fantasy series ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" he's consistently cited an episode in history that inspired him. Though the kernel of ""Ice and Fire"" came from an image of direwolves in the snow (per the Guardian) the conflict known within the books as the War of the Five Kings took cues from England's Wars of the Roses.

While Martin has been citing the Wars of the Roses as a starting point for years he's also been keen to put that influence into context. ""Some fans have taken that too far and have looked for exact parallels"" he told Beatrice ""but none of that really holds up."" Martin never intended to tell an allegory of actual English history with its predestined outcome; rather he wanted a fantasy epic with the flavor of historical fiction.

Nevertheless Martin has continued to draw on the Wars of the Roses as ""Ice and Fire"" expands. Thomas B. Costain's colorful account of the Plantagenet feud was the model for ""Fire and Blood"" the fictitious history of Westeros's Targaryen kings. But ""Fire and Blood"" contains within it an account of the Dance of the Dragons another Westerosi war of succession. With its princess designated heir to the throne a usurping prince and divided family loyalties the Dance draws on an earlier civil war in English history: the Anarchy (per Entertainment Weekly)."

One of the most important relationships a technology leader can forge is with the chief human resources officer (CHRO).

From employee engagement to training HR executives are involved in a lot of initiatives that have a direct impact on IT. In addition in a tight talent market IT must rely heavily on HR to gain an edge in recruiting and retaining valuable IT talent. HR in turn depends on a range of technologies processes and services that IT plays a key role in implementing automating and enhancing.

“Now more than ever having a strong partnership between HR and the CIO is critical because the demand for talented employees is so high” says Kathy Kay CIO at global financial investment management and insurance company Principal Financial Group.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIyMDgyMzAwNTgzMS9lbi9HLi1Nb25kaW5pJUUyJTgwJTk5cy1jb21wYWN0LUNpZ25vLVRyYXktU2VhbGVyLU5vdy1BdmFpbGFibGUtaW4tTm9ydGgtQW1lcmljYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,G. Mondini's compact Cigno Tray Sealer Now Available in North America,"TAUNTON Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Harpak-ULMA the industry leader in smart connected packaging solutions has announced the commercial availability of Cigno (pronounced Cheenyo) a fully automatic easy-to-use compact tray sealer that increases productivity in small-to-medium-sized food operations.

Cigno is designed for simplicity: streamlined installation low staff and infrastructure requirements and a gas flush design that eliminates the need for costly vacuum pumps and compressed air. Reduced complexity and intuitive functioning ensure greater ease of use while minimizing training requirements – making it more accessible at any skill level. Cigno’s smart connected design supports Augmented Reality guided work instructions allowing complete novices to become proficient operators in virtually no time. The Cigno’s toolless changeover design easily accommodates format changes without need of wrenches or trolleys. Its stainless-steel frame and easy accessibility meet the highest sanitary design standards resulting in straightforward wash-down operations. The Cigno delivers production flexibility effortless toolless changeover and a cycle rate of 20-30 ppm — all at a very competitive price point. These features make the Cigno ideal for testing and pilot purposes as well as back-of-store operations.

The Cigno can be conveyor-fed – delivering automated product loading capability at a price point typical of semi-automatic machines. With the Cigno advanced MAP tray-sealing technology is now available in a highly compact footprint (1.6 meters) — well below the industry standard of 2.4 meters. While the Cigno’s flexibility is suitable in a variety of products in many food packaging applications this next-generation compact tray sealer likely delivers its greatest benefits to smaller meat produce and ready-meal retailers as well as supermarket (back-of-store) operations.

Harpak-ULMA is G. Mondini’s exclusive distributor in North America. Carlo Bergonzi the Harpak-ULMA product manager responsible for the Mondini product line is enthusiastic about the Cigno’s introduction. “If you have space restrictions or limited technical support the Cigno tray sealer should be on your radar. It's an innovative machine design that can be easily integrated into existing facilities with MAP capabilities that apply across many food-industry segments” he said. “Adopting the Cigno is a great first step for smaller manufacturers or retailers that need tray sealing technology. It has the price point and flexibility of a semi-automatic machine but delivers the automated approach previously associated only with an in-line machine. Like those larger machines we also offer end-to-end automation solutions for the Cigno. The beauty of the Cigno is that it doesn’t require any compromise on quality or product shelf-life achieved.”

Former WWE star John Morrison addressed speculation that one of his final gimmicks with the company was dropped because of its similarities to one being used by Seth Rollins.

In an interview with Steve Fall of NBC Sports Boston (h/t Subhojeet Mukherjee of RingsideNews.com) Morrison explained WWE dropping his ""drip drip"" gimmick was due to creative chaos:

""The reason it got pulled back on was because Miz left [For Dancing with the Stars] and for some reason I had like three different plans that got changed at the last second. So I was just kinda sitting around. And if you sit around at TV for a couple weeks then you start to get into trouble you know what I mean? I think that’s kinda what happened more than Seth Rollins being the cause of it.""

Upon returning to WWE in 2020 Morrison was put in a tag team with The Miz. One part of the gimmick saw him carry around a ""drip stick"" that shot water. The company even filed a trademark for the stick at one point.

After a short hiatus at the end of 2020 Rollins returned at the Royal Rumble in January 2021. He adopted the persona of the ""Drip God"" and wore ridiculous suits onscreen when he wasn't wrestling.

Morrison and Rollins didn't cross paths often in 2020 because Morrison worked primarily on SmackDown with Rollins was on Raw. Morrison and Miz moved to Raw during the draft in October 2020.

Rollins moved to the blue brand following his return at the Rumble.

Morrison and Miz broke up in August 2021 after Miz turned on his partner. The feud didn't last long because Miz took a hiatus when he was cast on Dancing with the Stars.

WWE wound up releasing Morrison in November. He has been working in AAA in Mexico since February and made a couple of appearances in All Elite Wrestling most recently losing to Miro on June 1.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNwb3J0c3Rlci5jb20vcm9jay1zZXRoLXJvbGxpbnMtcmVhY3Rpb24tc2hpZWxkLXBvd2VyYm9tYi1jb3VnaC1ibG9vZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Rock Recalls Seth Rollins' Reaction When The Shield Made Him Cough Up Blood,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNwb3J0c3Rlci5jb20vcm9jay1zZXRoLXJvbGxpbnMtcmVhY3Rpb24tc2hpZWxkLXBvd2VyYm9tYi1jb3VnaC1ibG9vZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,,,,

City directors approved Resolution 52-22 regarding a shopping center during the city board meeting on Tuesday Aug. 16.

Members of the board voted 5-1 with Director David Allen abstaining from the vote. The shopping center will be a three-unit complex that should house Ross' Dress for Less TJ Maxx and Five Below according to City Administrator Phillip Patterson.

Patterson hosted a workshop on the development before the start of the city board meeting where he explained the details of the shopping center including a $1.5 million incentive package requested by developer Burk Collins and Company.

The incentive package includes waiving all building related permit and impact fees which is valued at $131613; extending city utilities to the project site which is valued at $165000 and will cost the city $58000 and reimbursing the developer a percentage of the projected sales tax revenue generated by the project totaling $1203387 for the first seven years Patterson said.

Burk Collins has developed similar projects in other cities that have approximately the same population as Siloam Springs Patterson said.

Developments include Market Street in Ardmore Okla. and most recently The Shops at McAlester in McAlester Okla. Patterson said.

The Shops at McAlester opened in April of this year according to John Browne the mayor of McAlester. The city of McAlester's incentive package to Burk Collins was $5.5 million upfront or to be reimbursed 90 percent of the sales tax for five years Browne said.

So far the Shops at McAlester has been a boon for the city Browne said. Retailers include Ross TJ Maxx Burkes Outlet and Hobby Lobby according to burkcollins.com.

""We are very happy with the deal we made"" Browne said.

Jimmy Cox the current president of Burk Collins said the company has specialized in retail development for 52 years.

""We have specialized in retail development. We have done residential industrial medical office as well but retail is the bulk of our business probably about 90 percent"" Cox said. ""Over those 52 years we have cultivated relationships with the retailers that are very near and dear and a large part of that as Phillip mentioned is we have found a niche market working in what we call regional hubs.""

City directors were mostly positive about the project although a few had questions about the development.

Director Lesa Rissler said she only spoke to Patterson a couple of months ago for five minutes about the project when she was in his office on a different matter and does not feel prepared to vote on this issue at this time.

""As a director one of the things I like to do is I would like to take the written copy of whatever I receive and take it to experts in the field and ask them give me feedback give me the pros give me the cons"" Rissler said. She went on to say she would like to see the board table this issue.

Allen whose brother is involved with this development only spoke about the administration of the agenda. Allen said he has never seen a workshop on an agenda that is then followed by a decision regarding that workshop.

Allen also said this is the first he has heard of this project and disagreed with Director Carol Smiley who said despite not knowing the specific companies involved Patterson had spoken to her and she believes other board members concerning this project.

""The info for this specifically only came out Thursday"" Allen said. ""So it is something that is detailed that has not been out and about for the public much less the board to see but I'm just saying historically we have never had a workshop followed by a decision of something this important.""

This led to a brief argument between Allen and Smiley regarding when information of the shopping center was given to the board.

Allen also said that when he was previously on the board it was common courtesy to table an issue if any board member asks for the tabling and doesnt't understand why there is a rush if one board member wants to do more research.

Director Reid Carroll agreed with Smiley saying that Patterson also spoke to him at the Arkansas Municipal League conference in June. Carroll said Patterson gave him some groundwork for it prepared the board's thought process.

""When I did see this I felt like I did have good information and I am in agreement with the percentages"" Carroll said. ""I like the research that's been done. I appreciate the gentlemen coming this evening so I feel like we're prepared for this.""

Director Brad Burns said he was not at the Arkansas Municipal League conference but said the information on the shopping center was brought out and that as an elected official it was his job to take a leadership role and make a decision now instead of dragging it out.

Rissler said all the board members serve the citizens but she serves the citizens in a different way because she cares what they have to say.

""I'm not here to represent myself"" Rissler said. ""I'm here to be a voice for the citizens. When they elected me they did not elect me to take their voice away.""

Rissler then made a motion to table the issue. The motion failed with a vote of 5-2 with Allen and Rissler being the only directors to vote for tabling the issue.

After the vote Rissler did say she is not against the project but felt she did not feel she had the time to properly research this issue.

Following Rissler's comments the board voted to approve the resolution.

City directors also voted on the following items:

Presentations

• Introduction of new police officers Prentice Carter; Esteban Gallegos; Daniel Newton and Ben Taylor.

According to our partners at the Milwaukee Business Journal a draft city tax incremental financing district plan would help fund a multi-phased redevelopment valued at more than $71 million.

The project could start as soon as next year and last into 2027. The plan includes more than $39 million in city financing to help pay for the project and provide incentives to Hull Property Group the developer.

Hull Property Group of Augusta Georgia acquired Regency Mall in 2016 and later acquired the vacant Boston Store connected to the mall.

The redevelopment plan states that 60% of the mall is currently vacant according to the Milwaukee Business Journal. Past redevelopment efforts refilled a former Sears and J.C. Penney with Dunham Sports Ross Dress for Less Party City Jo-Ann Fabric and Craft.

Regency Mall to be partially demolished for new grocery store

Around 400000 square feet of remaining vacant property would go towards a new ""grocery supercenter."" The operator of that store is not identified in the planthe business journal said.

A full redevelopment plan has not been submitted to the city yet but that development could be followed by new apartments and a retail center. The final phase of the redevelopment would include building five restaurants and developing another retail outlet.

According to the business journal the city of Racine is proposing up to $22.2 million in TIF spending to support the efforts. That number includes assistance with demolition costs $4.2 million to build new exterior walls and rework the preserved portions of the Regency Mall and $5 million needed to help relocate existing businesses on the property.

The TIF spending would be paid off by 2044 by property taxes on the anticipated $71 million new land value.

RCL,Royal Caribbean Group,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWFuZGZlcnJ5Lm5ldC9hcnRpY2xlcy9hLW5ldy1hbmQtZXhjaXRpbmctZXJhLWZvci1yb3lhbC1jYXJpYmJlYW4tZ3JvdXAtMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A new and exciting era for Royal Caribbean Group,"During the 33 years that Richard Fain served at helm of the Royal Caribbean Group both the brand and the global cruise industry changed almost beyond recognition. Under his leadership the group introduced some of the most famous and innovative classes of cruise ships ever built – including Royal Caribbean International’s Sovereign Quantum and Oasis classes as well as Celebrity Cruises’ Solstice and Edge-series ships. It also introduced pioneering new onboard experiences such as the cruise industry’s first-ever rock climbing wall ice-skating rink surfing simulators Aqua Theaters for diving shows and much more. Together these innovations ushered in a new era of cruising.

Certainly Fain is close to the top of the list of people who have had the largest impact on the modern cruise sector. Consequently when he retired at the start of January 2022 Royal Caribbean Group knew that he would leave big boots to fill particularly in an industry still recovering from an unexpected and prolonged shutdown due to the ongoing pandemic. However Jason Liberty the group’s new president and CEO is quickly proving that he is more than qualified for the role.

Liberty joined Royal Caribbean Group in 2005 and served in financial strategic and operational roles before becoming chief financial officer in 2013. He spent the past 10 years working alongside Fain before making the step up. “I think the transition and adaptation to the new position has gone very well – my predecessor Richard and our board did an outstanding job with preparing me for the role” he says. “I am also blessed to have the best team helping me deliver the best vacation experiences in the world through our leading brands and fleet.”

Now Liberty leads the company’s three global cruise brands – Royal Caribbean International Celebrity Cruises and Silversea Cruises (which the group acquired in July 2020 before selling Azamara Cruises) and TUI Cruises and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises of which it is a 50 per cent owner as part of a joint venture. In addition Liberty is responsible for spearheading the group’s strategy technology supply chain port operations and legal functions. He has had to hit the ground running in the first few months of his new role.

“The impact of the pandemic has certainly been the biggest challenge that has ever faced our company and industry” he says. “Whether having to navigate through almost two years of no revenue or ramping up the operations of our entire fleet in less than year the resiliency of our business the work ethic and innovative nature of our team and the incredible support of our partners has shone through this incredible black swan event.”

Today all 63 ships in the fleet are back on the water and most countries have reopened to cruise in a “meaningful way” prompting guests to return to Royal Caribbean ships says Liberty.

“Our fleet is fully back at sea our business has normalised and we continue to see strong demand for cruising with key secular trends such as consumers spending on experiences rather than things accelerating” he says. “Cruise offers a strong value proposition and as consumers look to get out and experience the world once again cruising is an attractive option.

“Our mission in the short and long term is simple – we look to wake up every day and deliver the best vacation experiences on Earth responsibly. Our priorities are to ensure we live up to our mission by having the best brands ships destinations and people.”

This year Royal Caribbean Group will host the official naming ceremonies for Celebrity Cruises’ latest Edge-class ship Celebrity Beyond and Royal Caribbean International’s biggest Oasis-class vessel to date Wonder of the Seas. It will also open new port facilities including a terminal in Galveston Texas. In 2023 it will welcome Silversea Cruises’ Silver Nova and Royal Caribbean International’s Icon of the Seas to the fleet – its first LNG ships.

“Our future is full of promise and innovation” says Liberty. “This combined with our amazing people and the communities we partner with around the world fuels my excitement for each day. We’re also doubling down on efforts to significantly reduce our carbon footprint and improve its impact on the communities that support our BlueGreen Promise.”

In May Royal Caribbean confirmed that its Icon-class vessels would be bigger than those in its Oasis class thereby making Icon of the Seas the largest passenger ship in the world when it arrives in 2023. Two additional Icon-class ships will join the fleet by 2030.

Features on Icon of the Seas are yet to be revealed but the brand has confirmed that it will offer the “latest innovations and signature features that Royal Caribbean’s teams have imagined and reimagined in bold new ways” as well as technologies that will enable a shift towards cleaner energy. The brand’s CEO Michael Bayley also set chins wagging when he posted a Facebook video of a large pearl-like sphere that is 46 feet tall and 50 feet in diameter being lifted onto the vessel at the Meyer Turku shipyard in Finland in May writing: “Exciting construction update on Icon of the Seas! A top-secret piece of the revolutionary ship is on the move in Turku Finland.”

Liberty notes that the Royal Caribbean Group’s portfolio offers “something for every type of guest and at every budget”. This includes everything from ultra-luxury and expedition cruising with Silversea to multigenerational “something-for-everyone” cruising on Royal Caribbean International ships and the “modern luxury” product on Celebrity Cruises.

“Over the coming years we hope to evolve the brands and other areas of our business by continuing to be a leader in innovation and technology” he says. “We want to bring the best vacations possible to all our guests.

“Royal Caribbean Group has many exciting projects on the horizon that will help us continue to deliver great vacations responsibly to our guests. We are also committed to working with our destinations around the world to offer our guests exclusive experiences including new offerings at Perfect Day at CocoCay our private island experience for our Royal Caribbean International brand.

“I look forward to bringing new ships online delivering superior returns and enhancing our portfolio to deliver on this mission every day. I’m excited about it all.”

Today Royal Caribbean management participated in a discussion with travel agents answering questions relating to special needs and accessibility while cruising.

Ronald Pettit Royal Caribbean’s Executive Disability Inclusion & Accessibility Officer addressed several topics along with Renee Didier Manager of the Sales Training Team.

Pettit has been with Royal Caribbean Group for over 16 years in varying positions and has led the cruise line as an industry leader in accessible cruise vacations. In the webinar today Pettit elaborated on a number of Royal Caribbean’s practices in making the cruise experience more accessible.

Here are some of the questions and answers from today’s session.

How much advance notice should we provide about a disability?

Ideally at the time of booking but “no later than 30 days prior to sailing except for sign language interpreting requests which must be submitted 60 days prior to sailing"".

What are the steps Royal Caribbean takes to prepare for guests before coming on board?

Royal Caribbean collects and reviews all accommodation requests working with relevant parties to prepare. C

loser to the sailing date about 10 days beforehand important details are disseminated to staff such as housekeeping and dining.

Where can you find the special needs form?

The special needs form is a very important tool for anyone to use. As listed on the website the form requires basic information including:

Personal details such as name and address

What accommodations are requested

If an accessible stateroom is required

Accessible hotel room pre or post-cruise

Any equipment that needs to be brought on board

Dietary request

Accessible shore excursion

Any other request

The website notes that information provided on the form will be shared with only those who need it such as crew members housekeeping staff and third parties including ground transportation staff or shore excursions where required.

How can I get assistance with embarkation and disembarkation?

The cruise line does provide a wheelchair and assistance in navigating the terminal and getting on the ship. Asking the day of can be an issue as the information is collected and organized days in advance.

Pettit did note that staff does their best to make sure wheelchairs are available when needed and organizing various boarding times is part of this process. Sometimes patience is required though.

While onboard the cruise scooters and wheelchairs are not provided unless it is a medical emergency. Royal Caribbean does work with companies that can provide mobility options that can be rented for the duration of the cruise and even delivered right to the guest’s cabin.

What can be done for guests with food allergies or dietary restrictions?

Pettit noted that dietary restrictions and allergies are the second biggest request after pier assistance. Royal Caribbean is very experienced in dealing with common needs such as gluten dairy and lactose-free foods which he noted are well highlighted on menus. However there are less common allergies that can be problematic for guests.

He advised cruisers can request the following evening's menu with modifications.

What type of options do we have on board for those individuals with autism?

Royal Caribbean is known to be first autism friendly cruise line in the world partnering with Autism on the Seas which helps them with specific products and services including sensory friendly movies an autism channel a social storybook to name a few.

In addressing this Pettit explained that there is lots of programming that can be offered on board the ship and literally they can make any of them accessible.

Can guests bring a service dog on a cruise ship?

When asked if service dogs are permitted onboard the answer was an emphatic yes with Pettit going on to discuss the critical evolving role of service dogs play adding they do many things: “Service dogs help retrieve object alert people that somebody is at the door there now medical alert dogs that help people to detect if they're going to have a seizure or to take their medication.

He did clarify that service dogs have been specifically trained to perform a very specific function or take to help a person with a disability different than a therapy dog who may not qualify under the ADA as a service dog.

Are there sharp containers and fridges for diabetics?

Yes Royal Caribbean does provide these in the stateroom and Pettit advised the need to clearly identify specific requirements.

For example not all diabetes medicine needs to be refrigerated.

If a guest needs oxygen can Royal Caribbean provide it onboard?

Royal Caribbean does not provide oxygen for their cruise; it is only available for emergencies so guests need to make their own arrangements in this regard.

He noted the advancements that have led to the portable oxygen concentrator that helps convert ambient air into on0demand oxygen which may be of benefit to some passengers.

If a guest needs dialysis can they sail with Royal Caribbean?

Guests who can bring their machines and do self-administered dialysis are welcome to sail and this has been happening for decades.

Royal Caribbean is unable to provide medically supervised hemodialysis; however some guests have been using self-administered NxStage equipment which which are permissible.

Guests can book through Dialysis at Sea (https://www.dialysisatsea.com).

Are there accessible shore excursions available?

Discussing accessible short excursions Pettit describes his team's effort ""I have a small six seven member team that deals exclusively with accessible shore excursions which are akin to a concierge service.""

""They work in various ports of call with tour operators to provide guests with what they are looking for. This is also why it is key to communicate well heard of time.""

Are Royal Caribbean's private islands accessible?

Yes they are and Pettit elaborated that both Perfect Day at CocoCay in the Bahamas and Labadee in Haiti have a good amount of access with hard pathways throughout the island accessible trams beach wheelchairs to navigate the sand pull lifts to get in and out of the pool and accessible cabanas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3N0dGhvbWFzc291cmNlLmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzIwMjIvMDgvMjUvb2ZmaWNpYWxzLWZyb20tcm95YWwtY2FyaWJiZWFuLWdyb3VwLWFuZC12aXBhLWhvbGQtbWVldGluZ3Mtb24taW5jcmVhc2UtaW4tY3J1aXNlLXZpc2l0b3JzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Officials From Royal Caribbean Group and VIPA Hold Meetings on Increase in Cruise Visitors,"Officials from the Royal Caribbean Group’s Operations and

Development team met with Virgin Islands Port Authority (VIPA) Executive Director Carlton Dowe his executive staff the authority’s financial advisor Frasca and Associates and VIPA’s outside legal counsel Womble Bond Dickinson.

The group met to prepare for an increase in cruise visitors to Frederiksted St. Croix starting in November 2022. The Royal Caribbean Group officials arrived in the territory four days ago and have participated in a series of working meetings with VIPA to lay the groundwork for the increase in passenger arrivals visit sites frequented by their cruise guests and finalize the agreement between VIPA and the group.

They are also scheduled to meet with the Bryan/Roach Administration and private sector stakeholders during the first week of September to discuss planned improvements for the cruise industry on St. Croix.

On April 26 at the Seatrade Cruise Global Convention the Royal Caribbean Group announced the cruise line’s plan to increase cruise passenger volume to St. Croix and St. Thomas. The territory will receive 70 percent more cruise passengers at Crown Bay and two and a half times the number of cruise visitors to St. Croix. This growth is in comparison to pre-pandemic numbers which were a maximum of 50000 passengers on St. Croix in 2019. A projected total of approximately 140000 passengers will visit St. Croix and at least 500000 is expected for St. Thomas via Royal Caribbean cruise ships this upcoming season.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vY3J1aXNlLmJsb2cvMjAyMi8wOC9jZWxlYnJpdHktY3J1aXNlcy1uZXctY3J1aXNlLXNoaXAtY29uc3RydWN0aW9uLW1vdmVzLWZvcndhcmQtdHVybmluZy1wb2ludNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Celebrity Cruises new cruise ship construction moves forward with turning point,"The Celebrity Ascent cruise ship is one step closer to being built.

In its latest move the Swiss shipping giant ordered two luxury cruise ships to include a hydrogen fuel cell that experts say will allow the ships in the Explora Journeys luxury line to operate in port carbon-free.

Already on the books was a plan to use a solid-oxide fuel cell that will run not on hydrogen but LNG taking advantage of the efficiency of using the technology to feed the power needs of the cruise ship’s hotel load with a fuel that is more widely available.

The twin approaches by MSC are part of growing moves by cruise majors toward fuel cells for auxiliary power as an arrow in the quiver of carbon emissions reduction efforts though use of the technology remains in its early innings.

As TradeWinds has reported MSC’s Explora Journeys has ordered two LNG-fuelled cruise ships at Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri that will also have two 6-MW fuel cells that will be powered by liquid hydrogen. The ships will be delivered in 2027 and 2028.

Two previously-ordered 962-berth ships will be upgraded to install the LNG and hydrogen systems which will extend the vessels by 19 metres in length.

Using hydrogen on the ships will allow for emissions-free power for the vessel’s hotel operations and will allow the LNG engines to be turned off in port.

But MSC is not the first. Royal Caribbean Group’s Silversea Cruises also a luxury line is planning to roll out its first cruise ship with hydrogen fuel cells and battery power allowing its ships to run carbon-free in port. The 1000-berth Silver Nova is scheduled to hit the water next year.

Shore power alternative

Moritz Krijgsman who leads the marine power systems team at Maritime Research Institute Netherlands (Marin) said shipowners are looking to alternative fuelling for auxiliary power as a way to slash emissions in a port without shore power.

“Several harbours do not have the possibility of electric power supply from shore and this is one of the alternatives” he told Green Seas.

Even where hydrogen is not used fuel cells are finding a role to play in cruise as a way to reduce emissions from hotel load. In shipping hotel load is the power needed to run systems other than propulsion and on cruise ships it is considerable. because they have actual hotels on board.

After a retrofit Carnival Corp’s 5000-berth AIDANova (built 2018) is scheduled for a retrofit this year that will make it first large cruise ship to feature a fuel cell which will be powered by methanol a hydrogen derivative.

MSC Group’s MSC Cruises is building the 5400-berth MSC World Europa which will introduce solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) when it is delivered later this year.

The ship will have LNG as its main fuel and as the fuel for its SOFC.

A product of Bloom Energy the fuel cell is a fuel-flexible platform.

All fuel cells ultimately require hydrogen but Bloom’s equipment on the MSC World Europa will use an onboard reformation process to produce hydrogen molecules from LNG which is more widely available compared to other alternative fuels.

“Because it’s a high-temperature fuel cell we’re agnostic to fuel. … Our platform can work on LNG hydrogen ammonia — whatever fuel is available” Bloom senior director of marine applications Suminderpal Singh told TradeWinds.

Right now what’s widely available is LNG.

As a high-temperature fuel cell SOFRs work best when they run at a constant rate providing a baseload of power that is ideal for hotel loads on cruise ships rather than the variability of propulsion Singh explained.

And its modular design is touted for greater reliability since if one module fails the rest can continue running.

Unlike pure hydrogen LNG is not without carbon; the chemical formula of its main ingredient methane is CH 4 after all.

But Singh said the Bloom system’s carbon footprint is 60% lower than using conventional fuels and an estimated 20% more efficient compared to using LNG in a traditional internal combustion engine.

Bloom is ready for its systems to be used with carbon-free hydrogen or ammonia whenever the shipping industry is ready to figure out how to get those fuels onto the vessel he explained.

“What we are seeing is it all depends on the fuelling infrastructure” Singh said.

Thomas a San Diego native who moved to the Midwest to pursue comedy shared a clip of the exchange during his recent set at The Laugh Factory in Chicago on Instagram earlier this week where it has gone viral.

""You work for the Biden administration? Is your job to wake him up or what’s your job?"" Ocean asked ""Nick"" as the audience erupted into laughter.

BIDEN VOWS TO WITHHOLD WEAPONS FROM ISRAEL IF NETANYAHU GOES FORWARD WITH RAFAH INVASION

Miming a fictional Biden staffer trying to get the president’s attention he exclaimed ""Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! There’s a war! Hey!""

The bit continued with Thomas asking Nick what he really does for Biden. Before he could respond the comic remarked ""What a s--- show of a job you have. I can’t believe you admitted that in front of all these people.""

""You have the freedom to lie. You could have said you were a hooker and I would’ve been prouder of you"" he added.

The alleged Biden staffer started to tell Thomas that he travels to southern states before the comic interrupted with a burst of laughter.

""That’s crazy! You go to the south and try to sell ‘em on Biden? You’re f----- r------! What the f---? What are you talking about?"" he said. ""That’s your f----- job? Is to go ‘Hey listen I know you guys like Trump but Biden. I mean…’""

BIDEN WARNS NETANYAHU AGAINST RAFAH INVASION AS ISRAEL PREPARES FOR ACTION

The clip ended with one last joke as Thomas asked ""Wow. Are you ready to be unemployed? Or what’s your vibe?""

Thomas captioned the video writing ""This was my only option.""

Thomas wasn't the only comic to take aim at Biden this week.

Anti-Trump comedian Michael Rapaport torched the president in a video he shared to X on Thursday in which he officially declared he would not be supporting Biden’s re-election after the world leader told CNN he would not send weapons to Israel if it invades Rafah Hamas' last stronghold in Gaza.

""Smoking Joe Biden. Cadaver Joe Biden. I never thought I would say this. I'm not voting for you. You're not getting my vote"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvaHVudGVyLWJpZGVuLWd1bi1jaGFyZ2VzLTAwMTU3MTYw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Judge denies Hunter Biden's bid to dismiss gun charges,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/09/hunter-biden-gun-charges-00157160 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvaHVudGVyLWJpZGVuLWd1bi1jaGFyZ2VzLTAwMTU3MTYw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMTAvYXJ0cy90ZWxldmlzaW9uL2Z1bGwtY291cnQtcHJlc3Mtd25iYS10di5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Caitlin Clark Hype Will Test the W.N.B.A.'s Television Limits,"The decision makers for the docuseries “Full Court Press” chose wisely when selecting which women’s college basketball players they would follow for an entire season.

They recruited Caitlin Clark whose long-distance shots at the University of Iowa made her a lucrative draw. Kamilla Cardoso a Brazilian attending the University of South Carolina could provide an international perspective. Kiki Rice from the University of California Los Angeles would be the talented but reserved young prospect.

Those selections proved fortuitous when each player advanced deep into the N.C.A.A. tournament. Clark and Cardoso competed in the most-watched women’s championship game in history before becoming two of the top three picks in the W.N.B.A. draft.

Growing up like many teenagers UN Goodwill Ambassador and entrepreneur Sabrina Elba suffered from acne and post-inflammatory skin hyperpigmentation. With a condition that causes dark spots where active red acne pimples once were she tried acids and many products from Sephora to clear her face of breakouts only for it to do more harm than good.

“I started to really feel the effects of that as I was growing up because the skin barrier damage it was getting worse” says Elba the founder of new skin care brand S’Able Labs. “It wasn’t getting better.”

Her mother however relied on the traditions of their Somali heritage to curate a natural skincare routine that always kept her skin breakout-free.

“I grew up watching [my mom] make [her] own products and face masks and DIY everything in the kitchen” she says. “I think that was probably I mean for sure the influence that led me to adding these African botanicals into the [S’Able Labs] skincare range.”

The potency of those natural ingredients passed down from generation to generation inspired the model to start her own African skincare line with husband and fellow African Idris Elba.

“The fact that we come from East Africa and [Idris] is from West Africa and this sort of continental theme African theme this Pan-African theme … what I realized and sort of become addicted to is these stories and heritage pieces around these ingredients and these customs” says Sabrina Elba.

Their African skincare or A-Beauty line is formulated with antioxidants — including turmeric okra quasil and black seed — to target skincare concerns on a cellular level like hyperpigmentation a common condition that people with melanin experience.

Among S’Able Labs’ newest products is their Okra Face Serum which is made with a trademarked bio-available retinol called SymRenew; African Resurrection Plant an antioxidant; the brand’s own Hyperprevent technology to lessen hyperpigmentation; and botanical peptides derived from okra which the company calls “nature’s Botox.”

“This has integrity behind it and an efficacy there” Sabrina Elba says. “And I want to show people that African ingredients are so powerful.”

By connecting these departments Salesforce strives to help businesses simplify their operations. The release of the new CRM underpins this offering clients a faster user-friendly platform to manage customer relationships.

Building on this point in a blog Kris Billmaier SVP and GM of Salesforce Easy wrote:

With the swipe of a credit card SMBs can start seeing results fast while larger businesses can get up and running quickly with Salesforce and then rapidly scale with the tools they need along their growth journey.

The solution also aims to pave the way for “amazing digital experiences” and help businesses piece together a complete picture of every customer.

Moreover the vendor pledges that Salesforce Easy will accelerate time to value “for companies of all sizes and industries.”

However it seems more likely to cater to small businesses especially with a $25 starting price and a “three-click setup.”

In addition the vendor has revealed few features at this stage. Yet Salesforce promises to announce more “in the coming weeks and months” that will enhance its native analytics commerce and marketing tools.

Nevertheless many of the already released capabilities are eye-catching. For instance it offers Slack Google and Microsoft 365 integrations to enable a speedy sign-on process. Furthermore guided onboarding will ensure the team understands ROI opportunities.

Email outreach automation is another eye-catching addition allowing teams to spend less time crafting marketing campaigns and customer follow-ups. In this sense it also helps to reduce costs.

Further Salesforce Easy functionalities include built-in best practices based on how top sellers typically use Salesforce and out-of-the-box workflows to accelerate sales processes.

Sarah Franklin President and Chief Marketing Officer at Salesforce also suggested that a trial may soon be available to tempt new users. Without sharing more she said:

The new trial setup and activation experience lets companies across industries access a single view of the customer and drive productivity save time and cut costs.

Cutting costs is likely on the agenda for many businesses as economic uncertainty beckons. As such Salesforce Easy is perhaps meeting an emerging market need.

However the vendor is most certainly helping combat the economic downturn in the UK by claiming it will create 270000 jobs over the next four years.

In making the statement Salesforce also announced the launch of Sales Cloud Unlimited. Shortly after it followed this up with a new digital storefront solution which will help Salesforce lead the headless commerce charge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMjQvc2FsZXNmb3JjZS1jcm0tZWFybmluZ3MtcTItMjAyMy5odG1s0gFIaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjIvMDgvMjQvc2FsZXNmb3JjZS1jcm0tZWFybmluZ3MtcTItMjAyMy5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Salesforce trims full-year expectations for earnings and revenue,"Marc Benioff co-founder and co-CEO of Salesforce speaks at the TIME100 Gala on June 8 2022 in New York.

Salesforce reported earnings and revenue that topped analysts' estimates but gave a disappointing forecast for fiscal 2023. The stock slid 7% in extended trading on Wednesday.

The enterprise software maker said its board approved a $10 billion stock buyback program a first for the company. But Marc Benioff Salesforce's co-founder and co-CEO told analysts on a conference call that the move won't prevent it from making more acquisitions.

Here's how the company did:

Earnings: $1.19 per share adjusted vs. $1.02 per share expected by analysts according to Refinitiv.

$1.19 per share adjusted vs. $1.02 per share expected by analysts according to Refinitiv. Revenue: $7.72 billion vs. $7.69 billion expected by analysts according to Refinitiv.

Revenue rose 22% in the quarter ended July 31 from the year-earlier period according to a statement. Net income of $68 million was down from $535 million in the year-earlier quarter when the company notched a big gain on investments.

For the fiscal third quarter Salesforce called for adjusted earnings of $1.20 to $1.21 per share on $7.82 billion to $7.83 billion in revenue. Analysts polled by Refinitiv had been looking for $1.29 in adjusted earnings per share on $8.07 billion in revenue. The revenue guidance would have been $250 million higher were it not for the impact of exchange rates Salesforce said.

Salesforce reduced its fiscal 2023 guidance for both earnings and revenue. It now expects $4.71 to $4.73 in earnings per share and $30.9 billion to $31 billion in revenue including $800 million in negative foreign-exchange impact compared with a prior forecast for earnings of $4.74 to $4.76 per share and $31.7 billion to 31.8 billion in revenue. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv had been expecting $4.75 in adjusted earnings per share and revenue of $31.73 billion.

The company has endured weaker economic cycles before Benioff said.

""Sales cycles can get stretched deals are inspected by higher levels of management and all of this we began to start to see in July"" Benioff said. ""Nearly everyone I've talked to is taking a more measured approach to their business. We expect these trends to continue in the near term and we've reflected this in our guidance.""

The slowdown was not across the board however.

Demand was slower from small and medium-sized businesses particularly in North America and Europe and specifically in retail consumer goods communications and media Amy Weaver Salesforce's finance chief said on the call.

""From a product perspective commerce and marketing saw more pronounced decelerations while sales and service remained strong"" Weaver said. Even with weakness in revenue Salesforce reiterated its guidance for an adjusted operating margin of 20.4% for the 2023 fiscal year.

The company's service subscription and support revenue totaled $1.83 billion in the quarter up 14% year over year. Revenue in the sales category which includes Salesforce's longstanding Sales Cloud software for managing business opportunities increased by almost 15% to $1.7 billion. The company's Platform and Other category that includes Slack did $1.48 billion in revenue up 53%.

In the latest quarter Salesforce announced the availability of new marketing and commerce tools and it acquired Troops.ai a startup that developed a Slack chatbot that salespeople can use to update customer-relationship management software. Salesforce which closed the nearly $28 billion Slack acquisition last year said it would increase the price of the chat offering for the first time since the app launched in 2014. The company reiterated its expectations for $1.5 billion in Slack revenue during the full fiscal year.

Before the decline in extended trading Salesforce shares were down about 29% year to date compared with a nearly 13% decline for the S&P 500.

Prepared Remarks:

Operator

Welcome to the Salesforce Fiscal 2023 second quarter results conference call. [Operator instructions]. I would like to hand over the conference to your speaker Mike Spencer executive vice president of investor relations. Sir you may begin.

Mike Spencer -- Executive Vice President Investor Relations

Thank you Emma and good afternoon everyone. Thanks for joining us today for our fiscal 2023 second quarter results conference call. Our press release SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR website at www.salesforce.com/investor. With me on the call today is Marc Benioff chair and co-CEO Bret Taylor vice chair and co-CEO and Amy Weaver chief financial officer.

We'll also be joined by Brian Millham president and chief operating officer who will be available for the Q&A portion of the call. As a reminder our commentary today will include non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings and press release. Some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties and assumptions which could change.

10 stocks we like better than Salesforce Inc.

When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen. After all the newsletter they have run for over a decade Motley Fool Stock Advisor has tripled the market.* They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Salesforce Inc. wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of August 17 2022

Should any of these risks materialize or should assumptions prove to be incorrect actual company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. A description of these risks and uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results is included in our SEC filings including our most recent report on Forms 10-K 10-Q and other SEC filings. And with that let me hand the call to Marc.

Marc Benioff -- Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

Well hey thanks Mike. And thank you everyone for being on the call today. As you saw in the results for the quarter we've delivered really strong revenue growth profitability and cash flow showing yet again the resilience and durability of our business model in this economic environment. Revenue in the quarter was $7.7 billion up 22% year over year or 26% growth in constant currency.

We had a great quarter but yet again the dollar had an even stronger quarter and we continue to see the impact on foreign exchange and currency fluctuation on our financials. For Q2 we saw approximately $250 million of headwind to revenue which is roughly $50 million more than we assumed in our guide last quarter and we now expect a total of $800 million foreign exchange headwind year over year for the full fiscal year. Operating margin in the quarter was 19.9% and we delivered $334 million in operating cash flow. Our remaining performance obligation or the total undelivered contract value that we have with our customers is really an incredible $41.6 billion and this is revenue signed.

It's not yet recognized. Now turning to guidance. Over the last few months I've met with hundreds of CEOs with economists business leaders political leaders and other experts about their business and where they see this global economy heading. And I don't think it's going to surprise anyone; everyone has got a slightly different answer.

And it doesn't matter who you speak to could be a different geography a different position everybody sees things at a slightly different way right now. But what we do know and what I think everyone will agree on is that digital transformation remains the No. 1 priority for CEOs and that every digital transformation begins and ends with the customer. That's what continues to drive our business forward and it's why Salesforce is the No.

1 CRM by market share globally according to the IDC Software Tracker. Now for those of you who have been on these calls with us we've all been through a number of these economic cycles. And we've especially seen that over our last 23 years. And once like this come around we see customers becoming more measured in the way they buy.

Sales cycles can get stretched. Deals are inspected by higher levels of management and all of this we began to start to see in July. Nearly everyone I've talked to is taking a more measured approach to their business. We expect these trends to continue in the near term and we reflected this in our guidance.

Given the significant impact of foreign exchange and buyers being more measured we're revising our fiscal '23 revenue guidance to $30.9 billion to $31 billion or about 17% growth year over year or 20% in constant currency. At the same time we're maintaining our fiscal year '23 operating margin guide of 20.4% an expansion of 170 basis points year over year. This is further evidence that we remain deeply committed to consistent disciplined margin cash flow and revenue growth as part of our long-term plan to drive both top and bottom line performance. We have the right team the right products the right playbook for getting to $50 billion in revenue in fiscal year '26.

We always get questions about our M&A strategy and what company we're going to acquire next and what we're going to do next from an acquisition cycle. I think we get this question every single earnings call that we do like this. And it's always one of my favorite parts of the call. And I'm excited to tell you we have found a great cloud company growing revenue for 73 consecutive quarters through every economic cycle.

It's got great cash flow No. 1 market share an incredible brand one of the most admired companies in the world great values fantastic community of 17 million Trailblazers fantastic commitment to its community runs across 90 countries. And that company is Salesforce. We're thrilled that our Board of Directors has authorized up to $10 billion in our first-ever share repurchase.

This reflects the confidence we have in our business and in our approach to generating shareholder value. Brian Millham is going to expand in more detail about the broader capital allocation strategy in a moment. And you'll also hear about some amazing customer wins in the quarter. I'm especially proud of a major deal we closed in the quarter with the U.S.

Department of Veterans Affairs and it's one of our most meaningful partnerships. The VA is a relationship that we've been building for over 6 years and now Salesforce is becoming the digital front door for our veterans and their families. We can't be more proud to do our part in helping those who have made sacrifices in serving the nation. It's been an incredible year so far being able to connect with our customers in person again has been just amazing.

We've done 63 marketing events so far this year hosting over 250000 Trailblazers and counting. But none is more exciting on every level than Dreamforce. And we're hoping to see all of you as we celebrate our 20th Dreamforce September 20th through the 22nd right here in San Francisco. It's a celebration of our Trailblazers and we're going to expect 150000 people to be here and registered to attend.

And we'll also be streaming the entire 3 days on Salesforce+ and expect millions more to tune in. We have an amazing line of product announcements and innovations and speakers and giving back. It's going to be a big Dreamforce. It's going to be really the biggest Dreamforce ever our 20th ever Dreamforce.

And we're also going to be celebrating the impact Salesforce has had through our one-one-one philanthropic model as we've now surpassed over $0.5 billion in grants 7 million hours of volunteerism and more than 50000 nonprofits using Salesforce for free. At Dreamforce the amazing Red Hot Chili Peppers that's Anthony and his entire band playing to everyone. They're going to be performing at our annual benefit concert with 100% of the proceeds going to our children's hospitals right here in San Francisco and in Oakland. So please tell your friends tell your firms tell your vendors tell everybody to get sponsorships to Dreamfest because it's going to be incredible.

And of course you're all invited to our investor day during Dreamforce on September 21. Amy are they invested even if they don't do the Dreamfest sponsorship?

Amy Weaver -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah Marc they are invited.

Marc Benioff -- Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

All right. Look you're not going to want to miss it. Look before handing off to Bret I'd like to congratulate Brian Millham our new Chief Operating Officer. Brian is employee No.

13 and has been helping us to build this company from its earlier days. As chief operating officer Brian is going to continue to lead our customer success organization and now adds global sales to his responsibilities. Bringing our incredible customer success ecosystem Sales Cloud sales even closer under Brian will help us to deliver the full power of Salesforce to every one of our customers in the new economy. And we're so fortunate that Gavin Patterson has taken on this important new role as Chief Strategy Officer helping us to guide our strategic direction.

And thank you and congratulations to Gavin. I'm so grateful to Gavin who for the last two years during the pandemic has overseen one of Salesforce's most rapid growth periods in Salesforce's history. When I look back at the last three years I saw it was really only two years ago in fiscal year '21 when we did proud I think it was about $5.1 million -- is that -- $5.1 billion. Is that right Mike something like that? And then last year I think for Q2 we did something like $6.3 billion and now we're doing $7.7 billion if I get the numbers right.

I mean it's an incredible trajectory of growth from over the last 24 months. And I couldn't be more proud of Gavin to help us during that period and now Brian in your COO role. Congratulations to Brian and Gavin. And with that I'm going to turn it over to Bret.

Bret Taylor -- Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

Thanks Marc. And congratulations Brian and Gavin. As Marc said we had another strong quarter delivering strong top and bottom line performance. Our results demonstrate the durability of our business model and the strength of our strategy.

Our Customer 360 product portfolio is the industry standard and the market leader a leader in 12 current Gartner Magic Quadrant reports. And the platform is helping hundreds of thousands of companies in every industry digitally transform. Our technology is also deeply differentiated. Einstein Artificial Intelligence platform is now doing over 175 billion predictions every day.

Just incredible. Our go-to-market capability is also unmatched in the industry. The diversity of the industries regions and lines of business we serve has driven the durability and resilience Marc talked about and you've seen in our business over the past 23 years. And finally our ecosystem is unparalleled in enterprise software.

As 150000 Trailblazers joined us for Dreamforce next month they represent a global community of developers administrators and ISVs 17 million strong that are driving what IDC estimates to be $1.6 trillion in new business revenues by 2026. As you heard from Marc we're in a more measured buying environment. Executive teams are scrutinizing all purchasing decisions and we are seeing some deals take longer to close. I personally met with over 100 CEOs this quarter in my travels across Latin America Europe and North America and digital transformation remains their top priority.

But the focus of the conversation has shifted meaningfully toward productivity efficiency and time to value. In this environment our Customer 360 portfolio is uniquely positioned to enable our customers to deliver both growth and cost savings. And you can see it in this quarter's results. Sales Cloud revenue grew 15% year over year a healthy 19% in constant currency including customer wins at CDW Zscaler and Schneider Electric.

Using our Sales Cloud and CRM analytics Schneider reduced their close time by 30%. And with MuleSoft they saved 40000 hours of employees' time and saved $2.7 million in IT costs. Service Cloud grew 14% year over year or 18% in constant currency including customer wins at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Workday and Uber.

Our digital service product line in particular accelerated as customers pivoted their spend to digital technologies that reduce customer service costs. Uber Eats is a great example. Uber Eats saw a 20% improvement in productivity across email chat and phone support channels with our service cloud and more importantly with their investment in our Einstein AI chat bots they improved their call deflection by 30%. Our marketing and commerce cloud grew together 17% year over year or 22% in constant currency including significant expansion of our relationships with Live Nation L'Oreal and Tapestry.

In our commerce cloud we are seeing GMV growth decelerate in line with the rest of the e-commerce industry as consumers settle back down to pre-pandemic norms. Platform including Slack grew 53% or 56% in constant currency including great Slack expansions at organizations like the National Weather Service Coursera and Mercado Libre. The National Weather Service selected Slack as its platform to connect over 4300 employees with emergency managers public safety decision-makers and local media partners nationwide. I'm also excited to say that we will have over 12 Slack product integrations with our Customer 360 platform live and generally available by Dreamforce where we have an incredible opportunity to help every one of our customers build their digital HQ and Slack in this new era of flexible work.

Data which includes MuleSoft and Tableau grew 12% year over year or 13% in constant currency with wins at brands like Atlassian Siemens Energy CBRE Group and King Power which is Thailand's leading travel retailer. I'm heartened by the progress we're seeing in our go-to-market transformation of MuleSoft. We are on track to have MuleSoft return to be in a tailwind for revenue growth in the back half of the year. And finally our 12 industry clouds were another bright spot in the quarter growing faster than our line of business cloud as our customers are increasingly focused on time to value and reducing their implementation costs.

The out-of-the-box industry processes we've built into our industry clouds are a compelling value proposition in this more measured buying environment and I'm excited about the new processes we brought to market in the first half of the year including trade promotion management for consumer goods and our virtual assistant for our Financial Services Cloud. As we head toward Dreamforce our pace of organic innovation has never been stronger. In our summer release alone we delivered key innovation like revenue intelligence for predictive forecasting the ability to talk to your data through Tableau MuleSoft Robotic Process Automation and a new lakehouse architecture for our customer data platform. And just this week we launched Salesforce Easy a new all-in-one self-service suite for sales marketing service and commerce that is going to transform how small businesses engage with Salesforce.

As you'll hear more from Amy we're committed to durable growth at scale. We're committed to our 20.4% operating margin this year and I'm excited that we're announcing our first-ever $10 billion share repurchase program today. Our capital allocation strategy is simple. We will continue to expand our free cash flow margin as we scale.

We will invest in our organic innovation. We will reduce the impact of dilution both by offsetting stock-based compensation and by maintaining a healthy balance sheet to fund any future M&A. I'm so grateful to our 17 million Trailblazers all of our partners and most importantly our employees for helping provide our customers with the innovation agility and resilience they need to navigate these uncertain times. Now over to Amy to discuss the financial details of the quarter.

Amy Weaver -- Chief Financial Officer

Great. Thank you Bret and congratulations Brian. I'm pleased to report strong top and bottom line financial results for Q2. That is pleased to report strong top and bottom line financial results in Q2.

As you've heard from Marc and Bret our diversified portfolio remains well positioned to help our customers both grow and drive efficiencies in their business. Our customers are relying on us more than ever to be their trusted advisor partnering with them on their digital road map. Now let me walk through our results for Q2 of fiscal '23 beginning with top line commentary. Total revenue for the second quarter was $7.72 billion up 22% year over year or 26% in constant currency.

FX continued to represent a headwind as the dollar continued to strengthen throughout the quarter. In Q2 the headwind from FX was about $50 million more than we had guided. A few highlights from the quarter. Sales Cloud continues to be a critical piece of our customers' success helping companies drive more productive growth.

In Q2 sales cloud grew 15% year over year and 19% in constant currency. Service cloud grew 14% year over year and 18% in constant currency as we help our customers realize efficiencies and cost savings. As customers focus on their digital strategy and transformation we continue to see growing multi-cloud adoption due to the number of customers who have purchased 5 or more clouds again grew in double digits. And Slack continued to outperform our revenue expectations with revenue of $381 million.

Slack continues to gain traction with customers. And in Q2 seven of our top 10 deals included Slack. And for the fifth consecutive quarter the number of customers spending greater than $100000 with Slack grew by more than 40% year over year. Now for a quick update on data.

I'm pleased to say that data passed $1 billion of revenue this quarter. And with that all of our 5 clouds are now generating more than $1 billion in revenue a quarter. Data growth of 12% or 13% in constant currency was driven by MuleSoft total revenue growth of 15% and Tableau growth of 9%. As a reminder approximately half of MuleSoft and Tableau's total contract value is recognized in period resulting in more quarterly volatility than our other core products.

Turning to revenue attrition. Rates remain at record lows ending Q2 at approximately 7.5%. Q2 non-GAAP operating margin was 19.9% driven by our continued focus on disciplined decision-making and prioritization. Q2 GAAP EPS was $0.07 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.19.

Mark-to-market accounting of the company's strategic investments benefited GAAP EPS by $0.03 and non-GAAP EPS by $0.04. Operating cash flow was $334 million in Q2 down 13% year over year. Capex was $203 million resulting in free cash flow of $131 million down 24% year over year. Now before getting to our RPO performance and guidance I'd like to address the current economic environment.

As both Marc and Bret mentioned we started to see more measured buying behavior from our customers which began in the last month of the quarter. This resulted in stretched sales cycles additional deal approval layers and deal compression. In addition we saw slowing in our create and close Slack self-serve and SMB businesses which tend to be leading macro indicators. Geographically this behavior was most pronounced in North America and major European markets while Japan was relatively more resilient.

From an industry perspective retail consumer goods and communications and media were the most impacted while high tech energy and financial services stayed more consistent during the quarter. And from a product perspective commerce and marketing saw more pronounced decelerations while sales and service remains strong. Turning to remaining performance obligation or RPO which represents all future revenue under contract. It ended Q2 at approximately $41.6 billion up 15% year over year.

Current remaining performance obligation or CRPO was approximately $21.5 billion up 15% year over year and 19% in constant currency. This includes 1 point of incremental FX headwind beyond our Q2 guidance. Moving to Q3 guidance. We expect revenue of $7.82 billion to $7.83 billion or approximately 14% growth year over year and 18% in constant currency.

This reflects a $250 million FX headwind. We also expect the $380 million contribution from Slack. As a reminder Q3 represents the fifth quarter of Slack contributions to revenue. Therefore the year-over-year growth rates will be normalized.

CRPO growth is expected to be approximately 12% year over year or 15% in constant currency. And we expect GAAP EPS of $0.09 to $0.10 and non-GAAP EPS of $1.20 to $1.21. Now turning to our full year fiscal '23 guidance. We are now guiding to fiscal '23 revenue of $30.9 billion to $31.0 billion or approximately 17% growth year over year 20% in constant currency.

This incorporates the trends in customer behavior that we saw beginning in July. The total year-over-year FX headwind is now $800 million an incremental $200 million year over year since our previous guidance. As a reminder the currencies most impacting our revenue are the euro the British pound the Japanese yen and to a lesser extent the Australian dollar. Our guidance continues to assume a $1.5 billion contribution from Slack.

As a company we remain committed to profitability over the long term. And while we see a more deliberate customer buying behavior I am pleased to hold our fiscal '23 non-GAAP operating margin guidance at 20.4% an increase of 170 basis points year over year. This margin guidance includes roughly 100 basis points of headwind from Slack. As a reminder because our regional revenue and expenses are generally in the same currencies there tends to be a natural FX hedge in our operating margin.

For the full year we expect GAAP EPS of $0.38 to $0.40 and non-GAAP EPS of $4.71 to $4.73. And please recall that our OIE and EPS guidance assumes no further mark-to-market adjustments of our strategic investment portfolio. We are updating our fiscal '23 operating cash flow guidance to approximately 16% to 17% growth year over year. Our guidance continues to assume a three-point headwind from cash taxes associated with tax law changes requiring the capitalization of certain R&D costs.

We expect capex to be slightly above 2% of revenue in fiscal '23 a nominal increase over last quarter's guide reflecting the revised full year revenue guidance. This results in free cash flow growth of approximately 18% to 19% for the fiscal year. So to close as our customers and their executive teams including the CEO CIO and CFO focus on their digital investment strategy we are well positioned with our diversified product portfolio to help drive efficiencies and growth. And we are laser-focused on disciplined decision-making with a commitment to achieving our operating margin guidance.

Lastly let me echo Bret and Marc. We are very very pleased to be announcing our new share repurchase program today. This step is a reflection of the confidence that we have in the future of Salesforce. And I look forward to seeing everyone at investor day on September 21 where we will go into even more detail on our capital allocation strategy.

Now Emma let's open up the call for questions.

Questions & Answers:

Operator

[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.

Keith Weiss -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. I think what's really on top of everybody's mind right now is the takedown in the full year revenue guide and what's causing that. You talked a lot about the macro side of the equation and we definitely see that all around us.

We definitely see that in our checks as well. But I think what people want to understand is there anything more to this? Is there anything more execution-related perhaps the go-to-market? And is the change in sales leadership from Gavin to Brian is this in any way meant to address any shortcoming on the distribution strategy? So that's part one. Part two on the expense side equation. Very impressive to be able to sustain 20.4% operating margin target even with the revenues coming down.

I guess for Amy is there another level of what kind of expense reductions or sort of another gear that you had to sort of go in to be able to sustain that operating margin expansion? And does that impact your ability to sort of invest in the business to sustain those operating margins?

Marc Benioff -- Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. I'm so happy to talk to you Keith and I'll tell you that you're right. We took the guide down really around two points. One is the foreign exchange environment is obviously just unprecedented.

And we talked about that last quarter as well. I think maybe we were one of the first to really see what was going on. Somehow just being on the ground in some of these countries that have been so dramatically hit. But to look at where we are right now with the yen to look where we are right now with the euro I think the euro maybe just broke parity yesterday.

I mean we're really in an unprecedented moment in foreign exchange. And on the other side as I said and I think as the team has really emphasized really starting in July we started to see some metrics where we're like where do we exactly want to be for the year? And what is appropriate for us? And how do we correctly characterize where the business is? And that is really how we kind of put together this guide which we think is the appropriate way to communicate the status of the business because we want to be in a place where we're communicating exactly where we are. So I'm sure Amy is going to amplify that as well.

Amy Weaver -- Chief Financial Officer

Sure Marc. I think you nailed it on that. When we look at the guide I believe the guide is appropriate under the circumstances we're seeing right now. And as you know that there's two key drivers.

The first part is FX the key currencies the euro the pound the yen they've all weakened to near historic levels and we're seeing that impact on our top line as we look forward to the rest of the year. For the remaining part as we called out there was a distinct shift in customer buying behavior that we saw near the end of the quarter. And for purposes of the guide we're assuming that those conditions endured through about the half of the year. Now turning to your second part of your question which I think was on op margin.

As you know I was very happy that we are committed to 20.4% and holding that despite bringing down the top line. This is largely coming from a more disciplined approach. It is not a result of one single change. We are continuing to unlock incremental efficiencies across the business.

We're asking each leader to step up and look at their businesses and prioritize. I do believe that we are continuing to invest into growth which still remains our No. 1 priority. In terms of the specific drivers definitely continuing to take a measured approach and a very deliberate approach on hiring.

T&E we are prioritizing for customer-facing travel. And again we are continuing to benefit from some of the decisions we've made over the last few years on real estate.

Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is open.

Brent Thill -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Good afternoon. Marc I'm curious if you could talk about Brian's new role. And I think there's a lot of concern as new head of the sales comes in that there's some transition period. And can you just address this transition period? And I know he's been with the company for over 20 years and highly regarded but there's a lot of investors that would love to hear your perspective on this.

Marc Benioff -- Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

Well that would be my pleasure. I mean I think a lot of you know Brian he's been a trusted part of our management team for over 20 years. And look the last time he was the head of sales was only two years ago when we went into the pandemic and went through the transition with Keith. You may remember I put Brian in for I think one or two quarters to run global sales did a fantastic job.

He didn't want to continue with it. So we asked Gavin to step up from his role of -- I think it was International Chairman or European Chairman I can't remember honestly. And really proud of Gavin for the last now two years. And then Brian is right here.

And I asked Brian if he would come in and take this forward and he agreed. And I couldn't be more grateful to that. I know we have just a trusted hand. In terms of the transition period I couldn't imagine anybody who will operate the organization so seamlessly and transparently and with ease.

And everybody has such a good relationship already with Brian. And he already runs our forecast calls. He's already been a key part of our sales program. I don't expect any transition period at all and I'm holding him to that actually.

Bret Taylor -- Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

The other thing I just want to add is Brian has been running our customer success professional services and partnership organization for a long time. And I think the story to the pandemic has been our historically low attrition rates and our focus on customer outcomes. And I'm really excited about the opportunity of bringing our global sales organization together with our customer success organization. And it's a really important part of our philosophy.

And I think this move --

Marc Benioff -- Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

Well we definitely surprised both of us right how low attrition Brian has been able to get. And how great a job he's done.

Bret Taylor -- Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

And deeply connecting that success motion to our sales motion I think reflects a philosophical view from Marc and me about really our philosophy.

Marc Benioff -- Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

Brian can you just step out of the room while we finish answering this? Do you want to just comment on this?

Brian Millham -- President and Chief Operating Officer

Yeah. First of all I'm humbled by the opportunity and Marc to your comments. I've been very close to this business for the past two and a half years working side-by-side with Gavin. I actually was operating in a COO role for him running this business.

And I think it's critical as we look at sort of the second half of this year and beyond this motion of customer success and sales together will drive the outcomes that we're looking for and our customers are looking for. And so I'm thrilled with the results we've seen on the attrition side thrilled with the results that the customers are getting from the investment they're making in our technology and just so excited to lead the sales.

Marc Benioff -- Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

Can you just address Brent's direct question on transition time how hard of a transition is this going to be for --

Brian Millham -- President and Chief Operating Officer

I think it was measured in hours actually Marc. I've been running forecast calls already. I'm in the business travel industry customers. I met with four customers yesterday there will be no transition time.

There are no big changes that we're going to be making in our go-to-market other than getting closer to our customers and ensuring that we're delivering value to them in every single transaction that we're working on with them. So very excited to take this on with zero transition time.

Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open.

Raimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- Analyst

Thank you. Obviously the slowdown that we're seeing or the lengthening of sales cycles there's nothing that is kind of unique to you guys. We heard from other vendors as well. Can you talk a little bit about what you see in terms of client prioritization in terms of certain projects? Because I do remember from the old times that the front offers always had higher priority because it's revenue generating etc.

Are you seeing that now happening as well? And can you speak to that?

Bret Taylor -- Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. Thanks for the question. First I'll tell you I think that trend continues. Digital transformation remains our customers' top priority and digital transformation starts and ends with the customer.

And fundamentally all of our customers are really investing into the secular trend of the digitization of their customer experience their employee experience and with our portfolio we're at the top of that list. I think what you're seeing is an increased focus on I say three things. One is time to value. The other is ensuring that these projects drive cost savings in addition to customer satisfaction and top line growth.

And then the third is reducing complexity and vendor consolidation. Some of the stories I mentioned like Uber Eats I think are great examples because it's really about how do you put up things like digital service technology whether it's chatbots or self-service to really take out cost and make these projects pay for themselves as opposed to having protracted multiyear implementations. I think vendor consolidation is also a trend that we're seeing. And if you look at some of the innovation we're bringing out like our Sales Cloud Unlimited edition or Salesforce Easy which I mentioned earlier in my script they are really efforts to enable our customers to do more with less to enable them to use Salesforce as their sole vendor take out some point solutions that perhaps aren't getting the return on investments our customers are looking for and sort of taking advantage of this opportunity to be the most strategic vendor for our customers right now as they look to really hold their technology to high standards which is to drive top line and bottom line performance.

Brian is there anything you want to add?

Brian Millham -- President and Chief Operating Officer

Great question Raimo. And I agree with you that front office is the priority you heard both Marc and Bret and I'm feeling to when we're out talking to CEOs digital transformation remains our No. 1 priority and we need to make sure that we're delivering for them. We're also seeing it in the demand environment.

We are still seeing very good generation of pipeline in our business right now. And while we are facing some longer sales cycles and additional layers of deal approvals and potentially some deal compression the demand environment is solid. And so you're spot on that we are seeing the front office as a priority for every CEO out there.

Your next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Your line is open.

Brad Sills -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Great. Thanks for taking my question. Thanks for all the color on where you saw the macro impact. It sounds like SMB marketing commerce but the core sales and service looks to have held in nicely you didn't call out enterprise.

So any specific color on how the core business and the large enterprise those bigger expansion deals in the core track this quarter?

Bret Taylor -- Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

I'll start and then Brian I'd love your commentary as well. As you said I think the story actually the past number of quarters have been the strength of our core CRM business. Sales Cloud growing at 19% in constant currency is remarkable. This is the product that Marc and Parker built 23 years ago doing -- so much revenue growing at 19% is incredible.

And you're seeing it just in I think the continued strength in our core business. And the other thing I want to call out is our attrition rate being at historical lows as well. And I think it really reflects the strength of our business. And so as Amy articulated as it relates to SMB GMV deceleration we're seeing things settle down to pre-pandemic norms.

But I still see incredible strength in our core CRM business in the enterprise. And as I said I think the durability of our business really rests on the durability and diversity of our portfolio the diversity of the industries that we serve and the diversity of the segments that we serve. Brian is there any color you want to add?

Brian Millham -- President and Chief Operating Officer

Yeah. Well said. On the sales and service cloud are sort of the centerpiece of our digital transformation for our customers. And you saw the growth in the quarter and we expect that to continue.

We are seeing some compression in some of the larger transactions in our enterprise business and it's not a surprise. I've lived through three of these cycles before and you can see that maybe people take a more measured approach to their digital transformation maybe starting with a smaller piece but a land-and-expand strategy is something we've used for many many years we can grow as the strategy we've used. And so despite the fact that maybe some of these engagements are a bit smaller we do see acceleration in these customers in quarters to come. So yes there was compression out there in some of the business but we are very confident that we can go execute against the opportunity in front of us in these large enterprise accounts going forward with digital transformation being a top priority.

Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.

Kash Rangan -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Thank you very much. Lots of exciting news for Salesforce. Congrats on all the changes. My question maybe Brian congrats to you as well in your new position.

What would you do to turn around the data cloud? I know clearly it has had some very significant momentum. But I can in some sense look at the new guidance versus the old and say a lot of that delta is basically the slowdown on the growth rate in the data cloud that is the Tableau and MuleSoft business. Brian want to get your opinion on that. And just the management team as you talk to customers Marc you've been through these cycles before what are customers saying as to when they might reengage at the same level of enthusiasm at Salesforce be deal size or close rate.

What are the things that they're looking for from a macro perspective or leading indicators in their business so it could be back to reengaging the way they used to reengage with Salesforce.

Brian Millham -- President and Chief Operating Officer

First of all Kash thanks for the question and I appreciate the kind comments. On the data business it's a unique business for us because some of it is license based. And you can tend to see some of the headwinds we saw in July show up more immediately there. We feel very good about where both those businesses are right now particularly in MuleSoft that as you heard Bret say is on a great trajectory and will be a tailwind to our revenue growth in the second half of this year.

We feel great about that. Tab is a critical component of our digital transformation with every customer wanting to leverage data to have better insights to the way they operate their business. So clearly a lot of focus on these businesses because it is such a critical component of every digital transformation. We feel great about that both those integration and analytics as a category for accelerated growth in the second half.

So no big concerns there at all. I would say on your second question we are not economists and so we're not going to guide on where -- when people are going to feel like they're coming out of this. We think we're being appropriate with our guide for the second half of the year based on what we saw transpire in July. Marc and Bret?

Marc Benioff -- Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

Well I think the main piece that I would really focus on is really going to be spending as much time as I can with customers at Dreamforce. This is our opportunity to really understand deeply across a wide spectrum of our customers geographies verticals what it is that they are seeing in their own businesses. But I think when you look at these customers we mentioned one is L'Oreal this has just been an incredible success story for us. We see the B2C story.

They're using Marketing Cloud and Commerce Cloud and Service Cloud. The Commerce Cloud story is incredible where they have almost 200 sites globally now for all of their brands. They've got highly customized experiences on the web and mobile and in-store for -- I'm sure a lot of you use the Kiehl's brand. It's a great product.

They have a whole new skin hub. They've been with us. They've really reimagine their business using Customer 360. It's a company that we're going to feature and focus and talk about and inspire others at Dreamforce.

I think when you see stories like that when you look at all the stories that we've seen especially during this pandemic surge over the last 2 years it's incredible what folks have done with their businesses. When we get to this moment I don't think it's a huge surprise that customers are more measured. Everybody is like wondering exactly where the economy is going and how things are moving forward. So this is a point where people are taking a little bit of a breath and then they will reassess.

And then when they get their confidence and kind of a full vision for the next stage of their company they come in. And until then it's a lot of the transactional business that we would normally see and move forward with.

Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Your line is now open.

Karl Keirstead -- UBS -- Analyst

Thank you. Maybe I'll direct this to Marc and Amy and it's about the $10 billion share repurchase. So maybe a two-parter. Marc maybe for you why do you think this is the right time in the company's development to move forward with your first large repurchase? And then secondly should everybody on the line interpret this as a signal that perhaps large M&A may be off the table for now?

Marc Benioff -- Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

Well it's a great question. And I'll tell you this was kind of I looked at this quarter very much as kind of a milestone. I'm a big fan of SAP and I have a lot of respect for their business and what they've done in the market over the last 40 -- almost 50 years. And to see our business in July do more than they reported in June in terms of revenue that was very meaningful to me and I'm very grateful and proud of our team for kind of hitting this tremendous level of scale.

But at that same moment I kind of also can say OK what are some changes that we can make. And one of the things we have such massive cash flow that I think it's completely appropriate for us to look at how we're handling our dilution for example. I think that's been on the table for a while and a lot of my conversations with investors they bring it up. We've waited for that moment.

I think now is the right moment where we can say we're going to directly address this with our kind of first-ever share repurchase $10 billion. I'm very excited about it. At the same time I don't think that that takes M&A off the table. I think that we continue to look for opportunities.

We want to be able to use our cash constructively. This is important for us. It doesn't mean that we're not going to have different kind of guardrails for M&A. And Bret do you want to just address that point?

Bret Taylor -- Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. I think Marc you articulated it well. I mean when I mentioned this before but the pillars of our capital allocation strategy are No. 1 that we're going to continue to become more profitable to generate expanded free cash flow over time.

That's what Marc was saying.

Marc Benioff -- Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. Thank you for saying that.

Bret Taylor -- Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

You created a great business model in Software-as-a-Service Marc and I think --

Marc Benioff -- Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

No. I think that committing to this -- committing to the margin for the year is so critical as well for investors.

Bret Taylor -- Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

It is. And No. 2 we're going to invest in organic innovation. And we talked a bit on -- there's a question Amy earlier on investment.

I'm so proud of our investment in organic innovation. You'll see a lot more of it at Dreamforce but I think we have a better pace of organic innovation that we've had in our history. But -- and then finally we want to reduce the impact of dilution which is feedback I've gotten from all of you. And we're focused on offsetting our stock-based compensation.

And we're also focused on maintaining a healthy balance sheet because we understand that's an incredible piece of leverage we have for future M&A. So I think this is a way to -- that we can continue to acquire in the future. It's been a big part of our company's history. It will be a big part of our future but do so in a way that minimizes the impact of dilution and does it in a more shareholder-friendly way.

Marc Benioff -- Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

And you can see like we've picked up some great companies whether it was ExactTarget which was kind of the beginning of really augmenting Customer 360 with our Marketing Cloud and then moving on to MuleSoft was amazing. It's really provided all the integration and the connectivity and then on to Tableau and giving this extension of analytics. So important to so many of our largest customers. And then Slack I just mentioned L'Oreal it's an incredible Slack story.

They've streamlined their communication. They've got -- they have that awesome Brandstorm event. Have you seen that Bret? It's that worldwide innovation competition that they do. They've got more than 83000 student participants 65 countries.

They use Slack to drive that thing forward. You look at that we're a different company because we had an acquisition strategy over the last decade. I don't think we necessarily need to break that. But at the same time we need to be paying attention to dilution and the overall making sure we have the correct capital allocation strategy as well.

Amy Weaver -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah Marc I think that's really it. When we look at this I think this is very much a natural evolution of our capital allocation strategy. And what it really comes down to is that we believe Salesforce is positioned for success over the long term. And this announcement reflects the confidence that we have in our business that as we look forward and our approach to generating shareholder value.

Marc Benioff -- Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. And I really think that when we get to Dreamforce and you see how we brought all of these platforms together integrated them you're going to see some really powerful integration capabilities. You already saw some of it at the World Tour in New York with kind of the first level of the customer data platform. You're going to see a whole another extension of that kind of capability when we get to Dreamforce.

And it's -- I think as Bret said it's in a very exciting moment in time when it comes to innovation with the company.

Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Your line is open.

Kirk Materne -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst

Yeah. Thanks very much. I think this one is sort of for Bret. Bret I was just wondering if you could go into the industry cloud strategy a little bit and what you're seeing going on there.

And can you just talk a little bit about how important that strategy is as budgets come under more stress and the ability for you all to go deeper with your customers on an industry basis? I was just kind of curious if you can give us an update on that and then how that strategy maybe plays out in a more choppy macro backdrop.

Bret Taylor -- Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. Thanks Kirk. We have 12 industry clouds spanning a wide range of industries where I think CRM is particularly strategic from financial services to healthcare to consumer goods and manufacturing. And you can think of our industry cloud is essentially taking the Customer 360: sales service marketing e-commerce Tableau MuleSoft Slack and building industry-specific processes and workflows that work out of the box.

And as you're sort of alluding to there's a lot of value for our customers. No. 1 is they don't need to pay us or a professional services firm to implement the table stakes for their digital transformation. It works out of the box.

That means they can focus their investment resources in the areas of their business that are differentiated. It means they get faster time to value. And it means that these processes are stickier which is why our industry clouds have lower attrition rates than our line of business clouds. It's been a huge area of growth for us and actually a lot of credit to our chief product officer David Schmaier who actually -- his company which we acquired a couple of years ago.

Velocity was actually independent software vendor that built industry solutions on top of our platform and has been a strong advocate for this strategy internally. It's a huge part of our go-forward strategy. If you have an option to buy one of our industry clouds why wouldn't you? More works out of the box you'll get faster time to value. So it's a huge area of investment for us.

I think the thing that we do really uniquely though Marc alluded to it is it's really all-in-one integrated platform. If you buy our Financial Services Cloud you get all the capabilities of our Salesforce Cloud of our service cloud or our customer data platform all in one integrated technology platform. It's very unique in the industry. And I think in this more measured buying environment it will become even more important though actually it was important prior to this as well.

And I think it reflects our alignment with our industry's go-to-market motion and vertical go-to-market motion and really focus on delivering faster time to value to our customers.

Thank you.

You last question today comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.

Phil Winslow -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst

Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to focus in on Slack. Slack again outperformed revenue expectations.

Obviously the large deal metrics are impressive too. What's driving the continued advance for Slack let's say relative to some of those other vendors that are heavier in the telephony or the video segments of UCaaS that have frankly have been delivering weaker results? And are you seeing strong call it stand-alone demand for Slack as a horizontal messaging platform or the Salesforce integrations that you highlighted driving more attach as a collaboration hub of Slack in the context of multi-cloud deployments?

Bret Taylor -- Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

Yeah I'll take that one. This is Bret. We are really happy with the performance of Slack. I think it's interesting we acquired Slack in the midst of this pandemic.

And now we're coming out of the pandemic into this new era of flexible work. Office occupancy rates are at historic lows. If you look at the lines of business that we serve like customer service I've met tens or maybe even hundreds of executive teams whose contact centers are no longer buildings. They're literally just in the cloud now and people are wearing headsets in their kitchens and basements to answer your phone calls.

And if you think about what it means to build an employee experience to build a customer experience in this new area of flexible work Slack is really at the center of those conversations. And that's why it was such a strategic acquisition for us because one plus one is truly equal to much more than two. When I talked about the innovation we're to deliver at Dreamforce it's across every single one of our cloud. We've been saying how do we help our customers whose headquarters is now digital transition their CRM transition their employee experience to this new era of flexible work? So we've seen great wall-to-wall engagements like Mercado Libre one of the customers I mentioned in my script.

But it's also really important that we've invested in integrating Slack with Customer 360 so that when we have a conversation say with a retailer preparing for Cyber Week we're coming not just with our Marketing Cloud or in our Commerce Cloud and our Service Cloud but with a Slack Connect channel that they can use as a command center for Cyber Week. That's key to our go-to-market motion. And I don't think it's at the expense of what you called stand-alone. When we land a deal say for a department -- marketing department Slack has such wonderful organic viral adoption that a year or two later we're selling to the whole company.

And I really think that's key to our go-to-market motion. And Slack is a relevant driver for every single one of the cloud and our Customer 360.

Marc Benioff -- Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

And I think a lot of the reasons that we bought the company that they really could benefit from our credibility with customers and our distribution capacity have really paid out. It's such a great product. And in June you probably know that Bret and I did the World Tour in New York. Many of you were there but the day before was the Frontiers Conference for Slack.

And if you haven't looked at the demo you really should because the product has come a long way since we bought the company. It's an incredible piece of technology --

Bret Taylor -- Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

Voice video. I mean it's incredible yes.

Marc Benioff -- Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

You have to see it to believe it. I mean don't you agree like it's something that's like really -- and for a lot of you are coming to Dreamforce I think you're going to see how a lot of our products have become Slack first. And also the number of integrations that we're going to be able to kind of bring forth how many integrations now do you have with these core clouds that you've been able to put together?

Bret Taylor -- Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

We have 12 integrations with -- and the reason there's so many is because it includes our industry clouds not just sales service marketing and commerce. But Marc you're going into something remarkable huddles which is the name of the new audio and video introduced now accounts for 34% of all communication inside of Salesforce. It's completely transformed the way we work and I'm pretty confident we'll transform all of our customers --

Marc Benioff -- Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

We've integrated Slack with Tableau which is really cool right? Because you can do collaborative analytics.

Bret Taylor -- Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

And with the capabilities we launched to allow you to talk to your data this is happening inside of Slack. It's just an incredible capability and as I said a relevant driver for all of our customer engagements and a wonderful way to I think drive and accelerate flag adoption that they would have had independently.

Marc Benioff -- Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

But a lot of our customers still haven't seen this. And I think that's why I'm so excited about Dreamforce because when you come to Dreamforce and you see the keynote obviously this will be highlighted. And I think customers will see in real time. What we saw for example in Frontiers even we didn't really have the opportunity because COVID was so freshly integrated into our World tour Keynote which Bret and I have lamented many times.

But I think that when you start to see the incredible innovation that have happened in the Salesforce core clouds like sales like service marketing commerce even Tableau you combine that with Slack. You bring that into the Customer 360 with MuleSoft the single source of truth. The way it's all being integrated with this customer data platform I don't think anyone else has this vision or is trying to even to execute it. And I've made this kind of L'Oreal -- I told you the L'Oreal story I said quite a few times you're going to see that in Dreamforce in real time.

You can see many other stories because I think for us just trying to communicate our vision this is like probably the most exciting thing going on here. We just brought 500 of our top executives together for kind of second half kickoff and showed them what we're so excited about and I don't think anybody walked away not thinking that we've not only got a world-class product that's highly differentiated but we're really where a lot of our customers are trying to get to in the next level of their customer experience. And Bret's made the point Amy's made the point Brian's made the point that digital transformation is underway but we all know that every digital transformation is beginning and ending with the customer. And you've got to have this beginning.

You have to kind of begin with the end of mine when that's all about building this Customer 360 and you're going to see this at scale when we all get to Dreamforce and I'll look forward to your feedback then.

It’s young – just about 6 years old – and it’s building its assets from scratch.

Privately held the company boasts more than 2500 assets built and under its management across the U.S.

Earlier this year Suruchi Ahuja 35 was appointed CEO after having served as CFO since the company was established in 2016. Tillman Infrastructure is a subsidiary of Tillman Global Holdings which was founded by her father Sanjiv Ahuja a former CEO of Orange and LightSquared.

In early August global investment firm Carlyle announced that funds managed by its global infrastructure platform committed up to $1 billion to partner with Tillman Global Holdings to accelerate its investments in Tillman Infrastructure.

Ambitious buildout plans

Tillman Infrastructure is ambitious: It plans to double its nationwide footprint over the next couple of years.

A big part of Tillman Infrastructure’s focus is providing long-term sustainable infrastructure to mobile operators in the most cost-effective way and it’s particularly focused on rural and suburban America where there’s a ton of white space still left to be covered and densified she said.

“We’re actually really unique in the market in that we are an organic growth story” she said. “We have built all of our assets in the last six years. We build entirely on order we don’t build on specs so we partner with mobile operators” as well as wireless internet service providers (WISPs) and regional carriers. “We are the most prolific builder of new macro tower assets in the country today.”

Tillman works with all the major U.S. service providers – AT&T T-Mobile and Verizon – and it’s been a partner to Dish Network as well over the past 18 months or so. “We’re seeing a big focus on network expansion from all of our partners” she said.

Bridging the digital divide is a big part of it. “We build for a variety of reasons” she said including where carriers have no coverage as well as areas where they have assets but want to densify.

How much is driven by C-band? “It is definitely a driver of the work that we’re doing but really every site can have a variety of reasons that the carriers need coverage” she said. In some cases the existing assets are overloaded and they need to augment them.

New kid on the block

American Tower Crown Castle and SBA Communications are the big three publicly traded tower companies in the U.S.

What’s it like coming in as the new kid on the tower block? The U.S. is home to one of the most mature tower industries in the world and she gives credit where due to the larger established companies that have been at it for several decades now.

It helps that Tillman Infrastructure has a lot of seasoned executives with industry experience she said. The former CEO Bill Hague is now vice chairman; he previously was with AT&T and before that held positions at Pacific Northwest Cellular/Western Wireless Communications.

It also doesn’t hurt that it’s bringing a slightly different take on the business model which is “how do we provide our customers with a fair transparent and long-term solution” she said. “We really came with a partnership approach” and a long-term view that includes making sure carriers have enough space on structures in case future equipment gets larger or heavier.

The company says on its website that it doesn’t require costly amendments for equipment changes and doesn’t charge administrative fees when carriers swap out equipment.

“We really focus on future-proofing both the physical and the financial business model so that the customers have a solution that works for them over the coming decades” she said.

Largest ever 3D Seismic Survey is coming to Tasmania

Surfrider Tasmania & No Gas Across the Bass are calling for no further seismic testing off the Tasmanian coast.

Schlumberger Australia Pty Ltd and TGS have announced plans to seismic blast 7.7 million hectares off the continental shelf from the start of the Great Australian Bight in South Australia through to Arthur River on Tasmania’s west coast.

The proposed area runs directly through the Nelson and Zeehan Marine Parks which were set aside to protect natural values and biodiversity. The proposed survey area sits just 39 kilometres west of King Island and 85 kilometres west of Arthur River.

Previous seismic surveys were found to have significantly impacted the marine environment and local industries including both commercial and recreational fishing sectors and therefore have been met with protests from local communities around Tasmania. Last year over 200 King Islanders participated in a paddle out to protest seismic testing that was proposed to the west of the island.

Seismic surveys are the first step in oil and gas exploration. Airguns mounted on the back of ships blast noise deep into the seafloor to map underground layers of oil and gas. The airgun soundwave is reflected off these underground layers to receivers at the sea surface. These airgun blasts are some of the loudest sounds humans can create. Last time seismic blasting occurred in the Great Australian Bight it was heard on the Antarctic continental shelf.

Surfrider Tasmania President Ally King says “It is absolutely ridiculous to be allowing international companies to blast our coastline with no benefit for local communities or regard for marine life. These projects are approved on a basis of ‘acceptable risk’

– which is convenient for these companies given the risks have not been independently investigated. The onus should be on the proponent to prove no harm and the precautionary principle should be implemented until that is the case.”

There has been limited research on the impacts of seismic surveys to marine animals. The limited science that has been completed clearly shows significant impacts to southern rock lobster scallops and phytoplankton.

Marine Biologist Annie Ford stated “Recent research has found seismic activity displaces damages and kills commercially valuable species in Tasmanian waters. Despite wide ranging impacts these projects are proceeding with little to no community consultation. We need to support the natural environment fisheries and local communities that rely on these oceans and coastlines.”

In 2010 a seismic survey in the Bass Strait killed entire scallop beds resulting in a $70 million dollar loss to the fishing industry. Push back from the commercial fishing sector led to a Parliamentary Inquiry into the impacts of seismic testing on fisheries and the marine environment resulting in 15 formal recommendations which included better compensation for fisheries. No recommendations from the Parliamentary Inquiry have been implemented by the seismic industry.

Local north-west coast fishermen Craig Garland says “At a time when there is a broad focus on achieving sustainability and rebuilding our fisheries and eliminating any risk that could or would prevent us from doing so i and many others within our different fisheries find it absurd and reckless that this destructive seismic testing is being allowed or even contemplated.”

Schlumber is expected to submit their EP to NOPSEMA the governing body this month which will be open to comment from the public."

You just have to watch those operating temperatures…

Why you can trust GamesRadar+ Our experts review games movies and tech over countless hours so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy.

The new SK Hynix Platinum P41 is aimed squarely at the very best high-performance M.2 SSDs for gaming. That’s novel for an SK Hynix drive. But it shouldn’t actually be a surprise. SK Hynix isn’t all that well known as a consumer brand. But it is absolutely one of the heavyweights when it comes to making the bits that go into SSDs like flash memory chips.

As it happens SK Hynix has just snapped up Intel’s entire SSD business (minus the exotic Optane bit which is simply being shuttered entirely). So it’s about to be an even bigger noise in SSDs. Enter therefore this new high-performance M.2 drive. It’s right at the cutting edge of currently available tech. Which means it’s based on a quad-lane PCIe Gen 4 interface. Gen 5 drives and the PC and console platforms required to support them are still a little ways out.

The P41 (our review unit was the 2TB version) also sports a new much upgraded SK Hynix in-house controller chip plenty of DDR cache memory the latest 176-layer TLC NAND memory and all-round specs look at least as good as established players in the performance M.2 market like the Samsung 980 Pro or WD Black SN850. While the P41 is in theory compatible with both PC and the latest Microsoft and Sony consoles this first iteration of the P41 probably makes more sense as a performance PC drive. More on that in a moment.

Design & Features

Design-wise there ain’t much to see here. The SK Hynix Platinum P41 2TB is a single-sided M.2 drive with no heatsink or spreader. For PC that’s fine possibly even preferable given that many premium motherboards provide SSD cooling. For the console it’s more of a potential issue. Again hold that thought.

Specs-wise the SK Hynix Platinum P41 2TB gets the aforementioned upgrade to PCIe Gen 4 support over the existing SK Hynix Gold P31 which was a Gen 3 drive. What’s more the new P41 also sports a new controller chip known as the SK Hynix Aries. It doesn’t just upgrade the drive’s PCIe spec. It also doubles the memory channel count from four to eight which is required to compete with the fastest M.2 drives. The Aries chip also has double the cores of SK Hynix’s previous controller plus 2GB of DDR4 cache memory. Nice.

When it comes to the actual flash memory chips the P41 has SK Hynix’s latest and greatest 176-layer 3D TLC NAND. SK Hynix reckons it’s roughly 40 percent faster than its older 128-layer tech. In terms of claimed performance you’re looking at 7000MB/s sequential reads and 6500MB/s writes for this 2TB model. Smaller versions of the drive have slightly slower write performance.

Of course most Gen 4 drives claim similar write performance. If anything then random access or IOPS performance is where a drive can really make a difference over the competition. SK Hynix pegs the P41 at 1.4 million read IOPS and 1.3 million write IOPS very healthy numbers indeed.

The final piece of the SSD puzzle is endurance. The 2TB P41 is rated at 1200TB write endurance. Some of the competition such as the Seagate FireCuda 530 comfortably surpass that with up to 2550TB of writes. On the other hand it helps to put that 1200TB figure into perspective. It’s enough to write hundreds of GB a day for decades. So it’s arguably an academic distinction. The P41 also comes with a five year warranty which is certainly on a par with the competition.

Performance

But is the SK Hynix Platinum P41 2TB’s performance also on par? For sure the sequential throughput is pacey enough to match the best whether that’s the Samsung 980 Pro the WD BLACK SN850 or all those Phison-powered SSDs like the Seagate FireCuda. They all knock out 7GB/s to 7.4GB/s reads and just under 7GB/s writes. So the P41’s 7.4GB/s reads and 6.9GB/s writes are right up there.

That said the 4K random access performance is just a touch disappointing. This is to say it’s competitive but doesn’t really change the M.2 drive game with 83MB/s reads and 255MB/s writes. Looks like we’ll have to wait for PCIe Gen 5 drives for a big step in 4K performance. Still the P41 beats all comers when it comes to the overall PCMark 10 SSD performance score and also delivers notably lower latency than the competition.

If we do have a reservation about the P41 it involves operating temps. Under sustained load it hits 71 degrees C. That’s quite a bit higher than most competing drives many of which only reach the low 40s. To be clear fitted to a large-tower gaming PC we detected no signs of heat-related performance throttling. But we have our concerns about whether this drive would suit the tighter hotter confines of a PS5.

Oh and for the record we measured the P41’s high-performance SLC write cache allocation at around 300GB. So you get those peak sequential performance numbers for plenty of sustained data transfer before the underlying performance of the TLC NAND memory is exposed.

Overall - should you buy the SK Hynix Platinum P41?

SK Hynix has slotted in right at the top of the Gen 4 PCIe M.2 drive market with the new Platinum P41. It’s quick by every measure thanks to SK Hynix’s own cutting-edge 176-layer TLC NAND and a new in-house controller chip that’s bang up to date. We had hoped the P41 might just set a new standard for 4K random access performance. But it’s probably not fair to be disappointed that it’s merely as good as any of the best Gen 4 drives rather than clearly better.

That’s especially true given the P41’s attractive pricing.At around $259 in the US (UK pricing has yet to emerge) it’s slightly cheaper than the WD Black SN850 and a lot cheaper than the Seagate FireCuda. Admittedly the likes of the Samsung 980 Pro have seen some fairly hefty price drops of late and can typically be had for less cash.

So our only significant concern involves the P41’s relatively high operating temps. They do not seem to impact performance in a PC context but we’d hesitate to choose this drive as a PS5 SSD. That caveat aside this is a very nice drive. Very nice indeed.

How we tested the SK Hynix Platinum SSD

Our SSD testing regime starts with entirely filling the drive with data. This reveals the size of any SLC cache can uncover any thermal throttling and also the quality of the drive’s garbage cleaning algorithms. It’s then onto PCMark10 for an overall assessment of performance plus an insight into latency.0 Then we cover off the usual sequential and 4K synthetics during which we also note peak operating temps. Put that all together and you have a pretty good overall picture of drive performance.

SRE,Sempra Energy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNkYmouY29tL2VuZXJneS0yL3NkZ2UtbG9va3Mtb24tdGhlLWJyaWdodC1zaWRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SDG&E Looks on the Bright Side,"Solar generation system additions to a home can be an expensive endeavor typically running upwards of $20000. While lower electricity bills are one of the major payoffs from installing solar panels and related items the upfront investment is intimidating to some – and more than many people can afford.

To help with the steep costs for those looking to transition from traditional modes of electricity San Diego Gas & Electric has started a new program that will help those San Diego residents who qualify – and are in “at-risk” communities as defined by the city – install solar at their homes at little or no cost.

The $10 million San Diego Solar Equity Program is part of the franchise Energy Cooperation Agreement SDG&E made in 2021 with the City of San Diego.

The energy cooperation agreement focuses on environmental and greenhouse gas reduction benefits safety equity and reliability. Ensuring equitable access to rooftop solar was a key element of the franchise agreement between the city and SDG&E.

The program which can be accessed at SDSolarEquity.org will provide $1 million per year of shareholder funds over the next 10 years to offset the cost of solar installations for income-qualified homeowners.

More than half of the total program funds will go to low-income households as defined by the San Diego County area median income. The low-income limit for a family of four in 2022 is $104100 the moderate-income limit is $128300 or less.

Aiming for 100% Coverage

The program aims to cover 100% of solar installation costs for systems up to 6.5 kilowatts at $4/watt.

SDG&E CEO Caroline Winn said that it is important to the company that “the clean energy transition is inclusive.”

“All residents regardless of where they live and their socioeconomic status (should) have access to carbon-free electricity and the benefits it brings such as cleaner air which also leads to healthier communities” Winn said.

The solar equity program will be rolled out in the coming months says Benjamin Airth senior distributed generation policy manager for the San Diego-based nonprofit Center for Sustainable Energy. The center which has been around for 25 years and reaches people in 48 states is designing and administering the program.

The Center for Sustainable Energy is currently reaching out to solar companies with an active license from the California Contractors State License Board to work with CSE-approved homeowners meeting the criteria.

Airth said that the program will allow people in communities most affected by pollution those who face the highest risk from climate change and who historically have had lower access to renewable energy to have the opportunity to install solar energy systems without the financial investment.

“There are great savings in the near term especially if you get the system paid for” Airth said. “With rising utility costs and rising temperatures we’re seeing people in these neighborhoods that don’t have huge homes paying a large amount of money on their electricity bills. With solar they’re going to get immediate savings.”

He said CSE is using a tool that is specific to the San Diego that shows by census tract which communities are most affected by pollution climate and environmental changes the most using an algorithm to glean information from the San Diego Climate Equity Index. Program participants must reside in an area of very low low or moderate access to socioeconomic opportunities as defined by the index.

The program will also cover up to $3500 for electrical panel upgrades for homes that need additional preparation for a solar installation. Many of the homes owned by qualified program participants have outdated electrical wiring and systems that would not work properly with the changes that the solar additions will bring.

“SDG&E shares the perspective of the city of San Diego and lots of jurisdictions about the need to expand access to clean electricity and solar to our residents and customers most heavily impacted by climate change and not able to afford to (transition)” said Scott Crider SVP for External Affairs and Operations Support at SDG&E.

“We have a commitment to city of San Diego being a good partner with the city and we’ve been working on getting it set up for about a year now” Crider said. “Through this partnership with CSE we are thrilled to have finally gotten this off the ground. This is also something we strongly believe in.”

Crider said that SDG&E is “strongly supportive of expanded solar use by its customers” and said that San Diego is one of the highest capacity users of solar with almost 20 percent of residential units having solar and most of it coming over the last decade.

Bioprinting for in vitro blood brain barriers. Acoustic tracking of humpback whales and marine robots. Smartphone-based health measurements. Understanding why jerboas have long feet. These are just a handful of the more than 94 different research projects undertaken by high school and college students in the ENLACE binational summer research program at the University of California San Diego in 2022. With its largest cohort yet 185 students from Mexico and the United States spent the summer in science and engineering labs on the UC San Diego campus getting hands-on experience conducting research while also learning skills to apply to college and graduate school immersing themselves in a new culture and making friendships to last a lifetime.

Estefanía Azcanio Muro foreground and Sofia Gandarilla look at tissue staining samples in bioengineering Professor Karen Christman's lab.

“This is the ninth year I’ve organized the ENLACE program and every year the students continue to impress me not only with their intellect but their drive to learn” said Olivia Graeve a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at the Jacobs School of Engineering and director of the ENLACE program. “In that time we’ve expanded from serving five students to nearly 200 this year highlighting the demand for this type of binational research experience. This program provides an opportunity to learn what it really means to do research and experience what life is like as an undergraduate or graduate student researcher while helping broaden students’ horizons of what is possible.”

The students are partnered together to tackle a real-world impactful research project during the seven weeks of the program. Some of the student pairs include one student from the U.S. and one from Mexico. Other pairs are both students from different parts of Mexico working and learning from their UC San Diego graduate student and faculty mentors who hail from all around the world. The goal is to use science and engineering as a bridge for students to build professional connections and personal friendships across the border that last a lifetime positively affecting binational relations.

Sofia Gandarilla a bioengineering student at UC Riverside and Estefania Azcanio Muro a biotechnology student at Tecnologico de Monterrey who is from Veracruz Mexico spent the summer in the lab of Karen Christman a professor of bioengineering. They worked to understand how the novel biomaterials Christman’s lab develops to treat heart attacks interact with nearby cells when injected into heart tissue.

In order to accomplish this they had to learn how to code using the R language how to do tissue staining and how to use microscopes to find infarcted areas of heart tissue.

“I learned so much. I’ve enjoyed every day I’m here. This is like a dream for me to be here” said Azcanio Muro. She said the experience helped her solidify her desire to pursue graduate school.

“I know that I want to do a Ph.D. and I want to do research” Muro said. “Before this program I was like hmm… do I want to be a researcher or work in industry? I didn’t know. But now I do know that I want to be a researcher and I want to do a Ph.D. because I really enjoyed being in the lab doing research. It might be stressful but I like it. I like this type of life.”

Her research partner Gandarilla participated in ENLACE as a high school student in 2019 and found the program so valuable she decided to return this time also serving as a chaperone to current high school participants. Her experience in 2019 helped her decide to pursue a degree in engineering. This year her time in the lab working to develop therapeutics that will one day benefit patients has yet again opened doors.

“I feel like this experience has opened up so many different routes and opportunities I could potentially take” Gandarilla said. “All of them are really great but I'm still deciding on which one would be best for me. In our grad school prep session this past week Dr. Graeve was helping me explore potential MD/PhD programs and the scholarships I can take to potentially get there so we’ll see; that’s an option.”

For high school students Isabel Watson from Moreno Valley Calif. and Angelina García Martínez from Monterrey Mexico part of the excitement has been learning what it’s like to be on a college campus and getting their first experience in a research lab. The pair worked with Alexis Komor and Neal Devaraj both professors in the UC San Diego Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry to isolate and verify two fluorescent cells. The duo learned how to prepare cells for expression and purification and how to perform transfections.

José Eduardo Martín Llamas and Nicolas Mosqueda spent the summer in mechanical engineering Professor James Friend's lab.

“I thought it wasn't going to be so professional” Garcia Martinez said. “I was kind of shocked to be working with actual Ph.D students. and I'm only a high school student; I’ve learned so much.”

“The closest thing I’ve done to this was trying to make white blood cells express a gene in high school” Watson said. “It did not work out because it was one class period less than an hour. It’s so nice to actually see what we’re learning come to life in front of us. It’s so cool.”

Watson and Garcia Martinez have also appreciated the opportunity to live on campus being able to walk where they need to go and use public transit to explore the larger San Diego area on weekends and evenings.

“I love going around town exploring San Diego” Garcia Martinez said. “Taking the trolley buses finding new places with friends. We’ve gone downtown to Las Americas plaza the La Jolla Cove; it’s been great.”

Nicolas Mosqueda a high school student in San Diego and José Eduardo Martín Llamas a high school student just across the border in Rosarito Mexico were placed in UC San Diego mechanical and aerospace engineering professor James Friend’s lab. Mosqueda was tasked with testing new materials for a catheter that can be more easily controlled in tight spaces like veins. Martin Llamas worked to use a tool called ELISA to accelerate virus detection using acoustic waves.

Neither had experienced this caliber of lab and research before.

“For me this was my first time working in a real lab” Martin Llamas said. “Nothing compared to the high school labs we have back in Mexico. It’s a different experience from what I’m used to.”

“Definitely new for me too” echoed Mosqueda. “It’s a lot different than the labs at the school classroom. A lot more intricate machinery more advanced stuff.”

Aside from learning from their graduate student and faculty mentors about hands-on research the weekly College Prep sessions were also hugely impactful for Martin Llamas who aspires to attend college in the U.S.

“In the College Prep class we learned how to apply to college private and public schools learned about the Common App questions all you need to know before applying to college. Maybe the homework they give to us is hard but I know that at the end of the day it's going to be very useful for me. Because I didn't know that to apply for a college in the U.S. you need to answer essay questions unlike in Mexico where you just take an exam. So it’s helped me better understand the college application process.”

Gandarilla left and Azcanio Muro learned how to use powerful microscopes and imaging tools to study cell movement.

While Martin Llamas and many of the students from Mexico have visited the U.S. frequently spending such a long chunk of time here is rare.

“As an undergraduate I couldn’t find any programs in the U.S. to participate in that didn’t require citizenship or permanent residency” said Azcanio Muro. “So this ENLACE opportunity has been very appreciated to be able to finally get this experience.”

For Mosqueda who hasn’t spent much time in Mexico he said the program reaffirmed something he’d known all along.

“Being with a bunch of people from Mexico for these weeks you realize that we’re all really alike even though we’re on different sides of the border. If I didn't know they were from Mexico if they didn't tell me I would have never known. We’re basically the same.”

This year many of the 185 ENLACE participants received scholarships to participate in the program thanks to the support of industry partners including Illumina Insulet ASML Hologic Sempra Energy Viasat Solar Turbines and support from UC San Diego.

The AWS post Learn how to leverage Amazon CloudWatch alarms to create an incident in ServiceNow explains how to leverage Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topics to send messages to ServiceNow and open an incident when a CloudWatch alarm is triggered.

Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service. You can create CloudWatch alarms that watch CloudWatch metrics and you can configure actions such as notification or AWS Systems Manager action when a CloudWatch alarm is triggered.

ServiceNow is an enterprise service management platform that places a service-oriented lens on the activities tasks and processes that enable day-to-day work life and a modern work environment. AWS Service Management Connector for ServiceNow enables ServiceNow end users to provision manage and operate AWS resources natively through ServiceNow.

This post demonstrates how to leverage AWS Service Management Connector for ServiceNow to create ServiceNow incidents when CloudWatch alarms are triggered.

Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are needed to follow along with this post:

ServiceNow instance AWS Account with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) access

Configure AWS

Create IAM users SCEndUser and SCSyncUser using AWS CloudFormation. Download this CloudFormation template to create SCEndUser and SCSyncUser users with required privileges.

Note that for this post I’ve granted limited permissions to SCEndUser and SCSyncUser as required to create incidents from CloudWatch alarms. If you intend to use AWS Service Management Connector for ServiceNow for additional use-cases such as Service Configuration Management Change Enablement etc. then you can grant additional permissions to IAM users SCEndUser and SCSyncUser as mentioned in the AWS Documentation.

Enable OpsCenter in the Systems Manager console as shown in the following:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlZ2lzdGVyLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzI0L3NlcnZpY2Vub3dfcHJpY2luZ19nYXJ0bmVyL9IBRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlZ2lzdGVyLmNvbS9BTVAvMjAyMi8wOC8yNC9zZXJ2aWNlbm93X3ByaWNpbmdfZ2FydG5lci8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ServiceNow: Customers 'struggling to understand the value of ELAs' says Gartner,"Updated ServiceNow customers struggle with its pricing policy feeling they are being nudged into higher price brackets and failing to benefit from supposed discount packages according to Gartner.

A vendor rating document from the omnipresent research giant said ServiceNow – a company promising user-friendly workflow software knitting together enterprise applications – ""continues to execute well expanding its offerings and driving execution around digital business transformation.""

But there were a few points of criticism pricing among them.

Gartner acknowledged ServiceNow had made progress on pricing but said some customers still face challenges.

They include a strategy which sometimes repackages functionality into new product type (SKU) as a way to ""upsell customers into newer and more expensive feature-rich products.""

At the same time ServiceNow would move customers away from legacy bundles to individual solution pricing as features move from an ""MVP status to mature."" This too results in unexpected increases in pricing.

Lastly enterprise license agreements – meal deals supposed to lower prices of individual products – sometimes increased prices Gartner found.

""Customers are struggling to understand the value of enterprise license agreements (ELAs) expecting enterprise pricing to be lower but ELAs are not all geared toward lower pricing (and may be higher than 'à la carte') but are designed to enable greater flexibility in terms"" the ServiceNow vendor rating said.

The Register has offered ServiceNow the opportunity to respond.

Another point Gartner makes gives observers the opportunity to reflect on ServiceNow's claims about its position in the software market.

The company grew out of the IT support function essentially providing ticketing and helpdesk software.

But CEO Bill McDermott has described ServiceNow as the ""defining enterprise software company of the 21st century"" as he promoted its expansion into HR supply chain and customer support.

Gartner said: ""While ServiceNow's product line continues to grow technology workflows remain a key revenue generator. Gartner estimates that these generate about 70 percent of ServiceNow's total revenue.""

The research group also found 57 percent of net new average contract value for ServiceNow is from technology workflows which is still growing strong.

However Gartner found ServiceNow had improved its ability to engage directly with lines of business and was the fastest-growing vendor in HR service delivery and customer service.

ServiceNow had worked closely with partner organisations ""to combine the power and productivity of the platform with the domain expertise"" creating innovative industry solutions.

""Despite their breadth of innovation these developments at times can appear disconnected from each other raising questions about the long-term packaging and costs of new capabilities"" Gartner noted. ®

Updated to add:

A ServiceNow spokesperson has been in touch to say: ""ServiceNow deeply respects Gartner's perspective on the market. We work closely with them to inform their research and we act on their feedback. We've been open about our growth path which includes expanding into solution areas our customers prioritize – HR customer service security and risk ESG ERP and more – and delivering on our reputation for fast time to value and measurable RoI.

""In fact in 2Q22 while ITSM was in 12 of our top 20 deals Customer Workflows Employee Workflows and Creator Workflows were in even more – and our 99 percent renewal rate remains the industry's benchmark.

CareAR has provided its SXM platform for the Lenovo ThinkReality A3 smart glasses which allow users to view multiple screens stream video and audio and object recognition using simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) techniques to superimpose digital assets.

CareAR’s ServiceNow platform also backs field technicians using Lenovo’s flagship smart glass devices to work with remote guidance experts for live instructions visuals and digital twins among others.

Bulent Cinarkaya General Manager of Field Service Management at ServiceNow said that AR and VR had become “imperative” to safe efficient field service management experiences and to quickly resolve issues and minimise “expensive on-site visits.”

Speaking on the partnership he added

“[It] will allow enterprise customers and service technicians to expand the use of AR to “hands-free” use cases and optimize the ways enterprises train technicians share knowledge troubleshoot issues and offer support”

Vishal Shah General Manager of XR and Metaverse for Lenovo explained that to date the rapid-paced nature of enterprises and posed significant challenges to field technicians to “instantly gain access to customer sites” namely as the latter expected and required vendors to “resolve issues quickly.”

He added

“Our A3 smart glasses and ThinkReality platform pairs well with CareAR’s platform to modernize the service experience by empowering field technicians and enterprise customers to access the insight needed to identify and repair issues quickly reducing truck rolls and costly downtime”

The device which features cloud-agnostic hardware and software ecosystems provided enterprises with multi-screen views remote guidance even in poorly-connected sites and robust device management systems across all tiers of business operations among many others.

Lenovo also struck a massive partnership with the Philippines’ FELTA programme to deploy EdVision immersive devices for learners while leveraging the former’s ongoing partnership with Qualcomm Technologies and its Snapdragon Spaces XR ecosystem.

The shares declined in premarket trading.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Sales will be as much as $7.83 billion in the period ending in October the San Francisco-based company said Wednesday in a statement. Analysts on average projected $8.05 billion according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For the full year the company cut its revenue forecast slightly to as much as $31 billion from $31.8 billion.

The reduced guidance reflects a shift in the tone of customers as the quarter progressed which particularly hit in July said Mike Spencer recently appointed head of investor relations in an interview.

Co-Chief Executive Officer Bret Taylor said the company was facing a “more measured buying environment.”

Salesforce the leader in cloud-based customer management software has a wide variety of clients across industries. It maintained high revenue growth through the pandemic and expanded its business productivity products with the $27.7 billion purchase of the messaging platform Slack which was completed in July 2021. This year however it has tried to rein in some costs including slowing the pace of hiring and reducing travel. Earlier this month the company appointed Brian Millham as chief operating officer filling a role that had been vacant since Taylor was promoted to co-CEO about nine months ago.

Many software peers such as ServiceNow Inc. have seen clients extend their purchasing cycles as the economy has weakened in past months and it’s likely that Salesforce has experienced the same dynamic Keith Bachman an analyst at BMO Capital wrote in a note ahead of earnings.

Spencer said the company is seeing “longer deal cycles” from its customers. “We’re seeing extra approvers getting inserted into deals -- CFOs are getting included in deals a lot more frequently than in the past” he said.

The shares dropped about 6.6% in premarket trading on Thursday before New York exchanges opened after closing at $180.01. The stock has declined 29% this year amid a broad technology rout that has particularly hit software vendors.

The company also announced a $10 billion share buyback program.

The buyback may be management signaling to investors that they’re conscious of the company’s share price said Anurag Rana an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “The stock has been so much under pressure over the last year and a half -- that may have sparked it” he said in an interview with Bloomberg Television.

In the fiscal second quarter revenue increased 22% to $7.72 billion beating analysts’ projections. The current remaining performance obligation -- or contracted sales that have yet to close which is a metric of near-term demand -- grew 15% to $21.5 billion. Profit excluding some items was $1.19 a share compared with analysts’ average estimate of $1.03.

Currency fluctuations particularly the strength of the US dollar caused about $50 million more in headwinds than anticipated in the quarter Chief Financial Officer Amy Weaver said on a conference call. For the full year currency fluctuations are now expected to cost about $800 million in revenue an increase of $200 million from last quarter’s estimate.

Subscription revenue generated by its platform unit which includes Slack gained 34% to $1.48 billion in the period ended July 31 -- the biggest increase any division. Marketing and commerce software gained 12% to $1.12 billion which was the smallest jump of any unit. Many analysts anticipated a slowdown in this division due to a wider pullback in marketing spending.

Over a decade ago Simon Property Group the owner of Connecticut's Clinton Premium Outlets started buying up property in a neighborhood in West Haven. Their plan was to build a sick mall/community/lifestyle center similar to Manhattan's ""The High Line"" called The Haven. According to NBCConnecticut.com and West Haven officials the plan is dead. No more The Haven for West Haven.

Brutal news for everyone that sold their waterfront family home along 1st Avenue in West Haven. To add insult after injury that whole neighborhood has had to deal with abandoned boarded up homes disintegrating before their eyes for over a decade. Here are a few before and after shots taken 10 years apart in July of 2011 and December 2021. It's shocking what a decade of inactivity has done to this neighborhood.

A Decade of Inactivity Has Done This to a West Haven Neighborhood The Haven was supposed to be Connecticut's version of The Highline in New York City a gorgeously landscaped outdoor shopping mall located on Long Island Sound in West Haven. Many in the neighborhood sold their family homes to the developers at the time and the project stalled for over a decade. This is what has happened to that neighborhood in the past 10 years.

Yet as convenience stores build out their delivery capabilities they face the same conundrum as their grocery and delivery counterparts: do they sink the investment into maintaining their own in-house fleets or do they sacrifice vital customer data and a portion of the sale by relying on third-party aggregators?

7-Eleven for one the largest convenience retailer in the world has deals in the U.S. with leading delivery aggregators. The c-store is available via DoorDash via Uber Eats via Grubhub and via Postmates. At the same time however the retailer is attempting to reduce its reliance on these channels and incentivize direct delivery ordering. Earlier this month it was reported that the company has acquired white-label on-demand delivery provider Skipcart.

Additionally the company has its delivery app 7NOW available in cities across the country offering on-demand delivery of hot food packaged snacks alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages a limited selection of groceries and a range of household essentials.

In an effort to drive frequency in the face of competition from aggregators and other convenience delivery services the retailer announced the launch of its 7NOW Gold Pass subscription at the start of this year. The subscription offers free delivery among other benefits for $5.95 per month significantly lower than the $9.99 standard rate for aggregators.

Convenience giant Couche-Tard also has a delivery deal with DoorDash and some of its stores are available via other aggregators. Additionally in the spring Food Rocket a company that delivers groceries within 15 minutes in Chicago and San Francisco announced the close of a $25 million series A funding round in which Couche-Tard was the lead investor.

“Food Rocket has an amazing entrepreneurial team and technology with the potential to disrupt the delivery space” Kevin Lewis chief marketing officer at Couche-Tard said in a statement at the time. “We are excited to partner with them as we continue to explore and pursue different and innovative new ways to serve our customers and make their lives a little easier every day.”

In an interview with PYMNTS last fall Art Sebastian vice president of digital experiences at Casey’s the third-largest convenience store retailer in the United States which operates more than 2400 stores noted that the company determines for each of its stores what the best delivery method is. At the time of the conversation the stores delivering via third-party outnumbered those with in-house fulfillment about two-to-one.

“When you do it yourself you obviously have to work on how do we optimize this?” Sebastian said. “How do we ensure we have the right amount of drivers that meet the needs for orders but we don’t have extra drivers standing around? So plenty of work there.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvc3Rhci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS83ODUxNTAwOTgvaXRzLW5vLWlsbHVzaW9uLWZhc3QtZ3Jvd2luZy1tdXNldW0tY2hhaW4tYnJpbmdpbmctZWR1dGFpbm1lbnQtY29uY2VwdC10by1hdXN0aW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,It's No Illusion Fast-Growing Museum Chain Bringing 'Edutainment' Concept to Austin,"The Museum of Illusions a private museum franchise that offers what it calls ""edutainment"" exhibits featuring optical illusions 3D holograms and interactive and immersive illusion rooms plans to open a new location at The Domain in Austin Texas in early 2023.

Smucker Co. announced it was coming back faster than anticipated from the impact of the Jif peanut butter product recall it sustained in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. The company originally projected a 90¢ unfavorable impact to adjusted earnings per share related to the recall.

“We came into the fiscal year with a 90¢ impact associated with the Jif peanut butter recall” Tucker H. Marshall chief financial officer said in an earnings call with securities analysts on Aug. 23. “That estimate is now 80¢. We did have the opportunity to come back faster both from a manufacturing standpoint and then beginning to refill the shelves at the respective retailers and so we were able to benefit which enabled us to reduce from 90¢ to 80¢.”

Mr. Marshall said the company was able to recover 65¢ of the impact in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 ended July 31. That figure included a meaningful insurance recovery. Smucker still will face a 15¢ per share exposure in the second and third quarters of 2023 related to the recall but “nothing material beyond the first quarter” Mr. Marshall said.

In addition the company took pricing actions in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2022.

“We are continuing to experience cost inflation that is having a mid-to-high teens impact on our cost of products sold” Mr. Marshall said. “We still anticipate 15 points of pricing for the full fiscal year. There is not a material change to that from our original guidance. And again what we are carrying in from fiscal ‘22 is about mid-single digits and actions that we’ve taken for the full benefit of fiscal ‘23 is high single digits as well on the pricing front.”

Net income at J.M. Smucker in the first quarter ended July 31 was $110 million equal to $1.03 per share on the common stock down 29% from $154 million or $1.42 per share in the same quarter a year ago.

First-quarter sales of $1.87 billion were flat compared with $1.86 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.

In US Retail Pet Food the company’s largest business unit sales were $729 million up 13% from $648 million in the same quarter a year ago. Segment profit rose 51% to $120 million during the quarter.

The company said the 51% profit increase in the Pet Food segment was due to “higher net price realization and increased commodity and ingredient packaging and manufacturing costs and lower marketing spend partially offset by a decreased contribution from volume/mix.”

US Retail Coffee sales were $598 million up 10% from $543 million in the year-ago quarter. Business unit profit fell 4% to $146 million.

“The coffee story is one of cost inflation that has needed to be recovered on a dollar-for-dollar basis” Mr. Marshall said. “And this first quarter is our largest cost component or cost basket so that is really what is driving the year-on-year margin pressure. But as we move sequentially through the balance of the fiscal year we would anticipate that our coffee margins improve. But getting them back to the historical 30-plus percent level will still take us some time as we navigate this inflationary environment.”

Mark Smucker president and chief executive officer commented further on the effect of pricing actions on the coffee segment.

“Although we did anticipate some elasticity in the quarter those were largely as expected as we’re now seeing our competitors follow in pricing” he said. “As we move forward we would continue to monitor very closely consumer behavior but we’re encouraged by the fact that over 70% of cups consumed are still consumed at home.”

In the US Retail Consumer Foods business unit sales were $311 million a decrease of 29% from $436 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.

US Retail Consumer Foods segment profit was $55 million down 54% from $118.7 million. Smucker said the drop primarily reflected the unfavorable impact of the Jif peanut butter product recall and the noncomparable segment profit in the prior year related to the divested natural beverage and grains businesses.

International and Away From Home sales were $235 million up 2% from $231 million in the same quarter a year ago. Segment profit was $17 million a decrease of 50% from $33 million. Profits in the segment were hit by the effects of the Jif peanut butter product recall and higher commodity costs the company said.

“Our first-quarter results reflect a strong start to the fiscal year demonstrating our operational excellence and strength of our strategy” Mr. Smucker said in prepared remarks released with the company’s first-quarter financial results. “Our teams have done outstanding work to manage headwinds from cost inflation industry-wide supply chain challenges and the Jif peanut butter recall.

“Due to the better-than-expected first-quarter results and sustained momentum for our trusted brands we are raising our net sales adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow expectations for this fiscal year.”

The company said it anticipates full-year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $8.20 to $8.60 a 4% increase from its previous guidance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2RidXNpbmVzc25ld3MubmV0L2FydGljbGVzLzIyMDcwLXNtdWNrZXItbmFtZXMtbmV3LWNoaWVmLXByb2N1cmVtZW50LW9mZmljZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Smucker names new chief procurement officer,"ORRVILLE OHIO. — The J.M.

Smucker Co. endeavored to recover from a product recall of Jif peanut butter the company’s Uncrustables brand helped pick up earnings in the first quarter ended July 31.

In an Aug. 23 conference call with securities analysts to discuss first-quarter financial results Mark Smucker president and chief executive officer expressed confidence in the Uncrustables brand and said Smucker is investing in facilities to step up production of its signature frozen sandwiches.

When questioned by an analyst about expectations for continued growth of Uncrustables through the remainder of fiscal 2023 Mr. Smucker replied “Yes we’re still very bullish on Uncrustables and everything related to it in terms of production remains on track.”

As the company’s current operations haven’t been able to keep up with demand for Uncrustables Smucker has engaged projects to expand production at facilities in Longmont Colo. and McCalla Ala.

“Completion of the Longmont Colo. facility expansion is on track to provide increased production capacity in the back half of this fiscal year” Mr. Smucker said. “Additionally we have broken ground on our Uncrustables sandwiches facility in McCalla Ala. which will further support capacity expansion as demand continues to exceed supply. We look forward to providing regular updates and progress on our path to grow Uncrustables sandwiches to a $1 billion brand in annual net sales.”

Net sales of Uncrustables frozen sandwiches in the first quarter topped $160 million an increase of 30% driven by “higher pricing and a return to double-digit volume/mix growth” the company said.

“Supply has not quite caught up with demand” Mr. Smucker added. “All of the work on production is intended to do so over time … McCalla is not going to come online for a couple of years but all of the efficiency improvements that we’ve seen in Kentucky as well as Longmont are going to support us meeting demand.”"

Published 08/24/22 at 6:18 PM PST

By Oregon Coast Beach Connection staff

(Oregon Coast) – It's easy to curse the cloud cover when out on the beaches. They clog the sky raining on your parade (photographically and literally) or worse yet they kick in just when there's an awesome sunset about to happen. Talk about dampening spirits. (Photo Manuela Durson - see Manuela Durson Fine Arts for more)

Not all is lost on these wonders of the sky: they can also assist the sunset with colors shades and even shapes you've never seen before.

Like the photo above of Bandon for starters.

Taken by Manuela Durson a frequent contributor to Oregon Coast Beach Connection it's a wowing scene of Howling Dog Rock on the south Oregon coast with the sun peeking through a small slat in the clouds. Sometimes the marine layers work in the opposite direction: instead of clouds bunching up at the shoreline there's a break just offshore from the beach.

Spring clouds are without a doubt the most regularly spectacular throughout the whole year. Oregon Coast Beach Connection will go so far as to say it's actually the best time of year to photograph the beaches. They along with other weather elements create velvety or pastel colors you don't see nearly as much other times of the year.

In this case you're looking at Arch Cape just south of Cannon Beach. It's sort of an inverted marine layer: that is to say clouds opened up in an interesting place along the sky and in a remarkable shape. It looks like a comet screaming through the atmosphere.

There's a whole science behind this involving spring's humidity the way cumulus clouds interact with light and other factors. Spring is Most Photogenic Time on Oregon Coast - Here's Why

Subtleties can abound as a sunset draws near such as this look of Tierra Del Mar near Pacific City one summer day. Remarkable colors erupt at the edges of the clouds as a marine layer shows off some startling shades. Yet add to that a nice big pool of sea water that's capable of reflecting these atmospheric wonders and you double your pleasure.

Clouds on the coast of Oregon do more than just cover up the sun. They can colorize it; bend and twist the light into some intense reconfigurations. Such was the case in Depoe Bay one summer day. The air simply abruptly exploded into these vibrant shades of orange and red.





Then perhaps 20 minutes later after the sun had gone down the world suddenly became this dreamy surreal shade of purple. In both pictures here is the mini headland of the basalt cliffs known as North Point one of Depoe Bay's most amazing little secrets.

Again on the south Oregon coast this time at Port Orford Durson (see Manuela Durson Fine Arts for more) may well be the south coast's “Queen of Cloud Captures” always finding a way to make existing clouds into something special. Here the fluffy sky floaters are painted in beautiful deep shades of oranges and reds looking almost like a Maxfield Parrish piece.

Manzanita produced this extraordinary moment in 2011. A massive marine layer begins to encroach on these beaches and seems to bunch and bundle up creating an unusual puffy look. With the right sunset colors and angles its bubbles and shapes are transformed into something like a sand haboob – looking like those desert storms you see in Arizona or the Middle East. Hotels in Manzanita Wheeler - Where to eat - Manzanita Wheeler Maps and Virtual Tours

This is a sign of something rather unusual about Manzanita: it's got a habit of shooing clouds away. Here's the strange science behind that: Manzanita Is Indeed 'Banana Belt' of N. Oregon Coast

Quite possibly the most esoteric and unforgettable sunsets ever caught by Oregon Coast Beach Connection cameras happened in Seaside in 2004 – a few years before the publication existed actually. Here taken during that coveted Second Summer in mid-October the dark clouds of the day opened up just enough to pinch out a weird little ray of light. When reflected in the water these dreamlike shafts of triangular light took on a kind of Pink Floyd-like look.

Striking. Surreal. Stunning. Unbelievable had we not been there to actually snap the pic. Hotels in Seaside - Where to eat - Seaside Maps and Virtual Tours

At the time Hepburn was 74 years old and had just released On Golden Pond the film for which she would win her fourth Academy Award.

Walters and Hepburn's interview—their first one of four over the years—lives on primarily because of an infamous question Walter asked about trees. But another moment from the interview is even more entertaining and shows Hepburn's quick wit as she snaps at Walters in her response. Read on to find out what Walters said that made the beloved actor pull out a hilariously scathing reply.

It all started when they were talking about women having careers.

Much of Walters and Hepburn's conversation was about the question of whether women can ""have it all""—a successful career and a happy spouse and children per The Hollywood Reporter. Hepburn explained that she didn't think it would be possible for her and the sort of career that she wanted. The Philadelphia Story star was married once in her early twenties and never had children.

Speaking about how many men might not have been happy with a woman who wanted to have a career Hepburn said ""We're very confused sexually. Very confused … I put on pants 50 years ago and declared a sort of middle road. I have not lived as a woman. I have lived as a man.""

She then added ""Well I've just done what I … wanted to and I made enough money to support myself and I ain't afraid of being alone.""

Walters asked a follow-up question.

Hepburn was known for wearing pants at a time when women primarily wore skirts and dresses. In response to Hepburn's statement that she lived more like a man Walters said ""Is that why also you wear pants?"" Hepburn replied ""No I just wore pants because they're comfortable.""

Hepburn had a cutting response to whether she owns a skirt.

Walters continued the line of questioning and said ""Do you ever wear a skirt by the way?""

""I have one"" Hepburn responded.

""You have one?"" Walters asked.

At this Hepburn said ""I'll wear it to your funeral.""

Hepburn cracked up at her comment and Walters found it funny too. ""You'll wear it to my funeral?"" Walters asked. ""I'd be delighted to know you were coming. May I tell my friends?""

Another famous exchange had to do with trees.

The most frequently mocked part of Hepburn and Walters' 1981 interview came when Walters infamously asked Hepburn what type of tree she would be. To be fair it was Hepburn who brought up trees in the first place. When they were talking about how Hepburn viewed herself at this point in her life she said ""I'm a very strong… I've become a sort of you know thing.""

""What?"" Walters said.

""I don't know what. A tree or something"" Hepburn responded.

At that Walters asked ""What kind of a tree are you? If you think you're a tree now.""

""I hope I'm not an elm with Dutch elm disease because then I'm withering"" Hepburn responded laughing. ""Everybody would like to be an oak tree. That's very strong very pretty.""

Walters loved interviewing Hepburn.

On the special Interviews of a Lifetime Walters reflected on interviewing Hepburn four times. ""If they said I could only interview one person over and over again for the rest of my life I would pick Katharine Hepburn"" she said.

During a 20/20 special in 2004 Walters played the clips about the pants and the tree and said ""By the way at my funeral or perhaps in my obituary it may mention that I once asked Katharine Hepburn what kind of a tree she wanted to be. Well that's not exactly what happened … I didn't ask her she brought it up. What was I to do?""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vdWsubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvdG9tbXktbGVlLXRhdW50cy1pbnN0YWdyYW0teWV0LTEzMzgyOTc4My5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tommy Lee taunts Instagram with yet another cheeky nude upload: 'This cool?!',"Tommy Lee taunts Instagram with yet another cheeky nude upload: ‘This cool?!’

Tommy Lee has followed up his recent X-rated photo which saw him completely expose himself with another cheeky snap on Instagram.

The 59-year-old rocker shared a full-frontal photo of himself in a bathtub earlier this month causing a stir among shocked followers.

While Instagram removed the controversial picture five hours later Tommy reposted it on his Twitter page where it still remains and has since reshared images of the explicit photo as it’s been recreated in colourful patterns and printed on fans’ T-shirts.

Tommy has fuelled the drama surrounding his full-frontal snap as he’s posted another photo of himself in the nude this time showing him floating around a pool on an inflatable.

The Mötley Crüe star was seen in the picture sat strategically in the middle of the blow-up object as it had a protruding extension covering up his modesty.

Tommy taunted Instagram as he captioned: “Yo @instagramâ¼ï¸ This cool!?” referencing the social media platform’s unacceptance over his full-frontal photo.

Fans gave their reactions to the musician’s playful photo as one person wrote: “Well this is a miniature version though so not as scandalous…”

A second fan said: “You gonna put someone’s eye out!” as another added: “Dear god he’s back at it again”.

Tommy said: “A couple of weeks ago we had a two-week break off the tour and I went on a motherf***ing bender bro.

“I got f***ing sideways as f*** and got naked and posted pictures of my d***.

“Usually I mean I’m a t***y man so I like to see t*****s but tonight is equal-opportunity night.”

The rocker then asked the crowd to join him in his exposing actions adding: “Tonight I wanna see everyone’s d***. C’mon boys pull your s**t out. Pull your f***ing junk out.

The caption reads: “First day of 1st. 4th and 6th grade! How?!”

However the snap has since been re-posted to Reddit where social forum users have claimed it appears that the woman may have edited her daughter's figure.

“This woman constantly photoshops her daughter’s body to look like this. She’s EIGHT"" the poster claimed.

On inspection the daughter's arms appear to look wavy suggesting the photo may have been edited or stretched.

According to the poster several of the mum's Facebook friends have called her out for digitally editing the photos.

However she “adamantly denies” the claims and says her daughter “just looks like that.”

ATLANTA — It's been a tough labor market especially as society eases out of a global pandemic and some employers have weathered the ups and downs of a tumultuous economy. Despite it all employees of some of the nation's most well-known companies have weighed in on what makes their place of work great.

Forbes released its fourth edition of America's Best Employers By State utilizing data compiled with market research company Statista ranking the best businesses to work for by state.

After surveying 70000 people working for businesses with at least 500 companies here's how Georgia-based companies stacked up.

Top 7 Georgia-based employers according to Forbes

Delta Air Lines

Delta soared to the top ranking for Georgia. As airlines struggle to ramp up flights to pre-pandemic levels the industry has had to weather customer service woes including cancelled and delayed flights. Despite it all Delta's 81000 employees helped fly the company to the No. 1 spot when compared to all similar companies in Georgia.

Southern Company

Southern Company has sparked some employee pride as its 27300 workers helped boost the Atlanta-based utility business to the No. 2 spot. Helping to bring electric services in Alabama Florida and Mississippi its workers in Georgia have left glowing reviews to earn it a spot on the state's list of best employers according to Forbes.

Emory University

Described as a southern academic powerhouse Emory University ranks as No. 4 on Georgia's list right below Google. Considering the tech giant's silicon valley origins Emory is ranked as the third-best Georgia-based employer according to Forbes' list. The research university employs around 32600 people boasting a beautiful campus to work in and even secured $831 million in research funding in 2020.

Shepherd Center

Right below Emory University sits private not-for-profit hospital Shepherd Center. The Atlanta-based hospital focuses on medical treatment research and rehabilitation for people with spinal cord injuries and diseases widening its mission to also include those who have acquired a brain injury and other neuromuscular diagnosis. Outside of Forbes' list it also ranks in the top 10 rehabilitation centers.

Piedmont Healthcare

Georgia seemingly has great medical facilities to work for as Piedmont Healthcare is another Atlanta-based company ranking on Forbes' Best Employers by State list. In turn it also ranked among Forbes' America's Best Large Employers list in the healthcare category. On Forbes' Georgia list Piedmont slides into the No. 10 spot. However when it comes to employers based in Georgia Piedmont rounds out the top five. The not-for-profit community health system has 19 hospitals with around 23000 employers.

Northside Hospital

Right after Piedmont is Northside Hospital with 24500 employees ranking the healthcare system with glowing recommendations. The Atlanta-based network has three full-service acute-care and not-for-profit hospitals. Northside also has outpatient centers and medical office buildings in the Atlanta metro area which help serve nearly 2 million patients per year according to Forbes.

Houston County Schools

Sliding in to the Top 15 in Forbes' list for Georgia is Houston County Schools based in Perry. When it comes to employers based in the Peach State the school district actually ranks No. 7 as one of Forbes' Best Employers By State. According to its website the school district educates around 30000 kindergarten through twelfth grade students on 38 campuses. Its Board of Education originated in 1870 along with the creation of the Georgia Constitution the district said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmphY2tzb252aWxsZS5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc3BvcnRzL2dvbGYvMjAyMi8wOC8yNC9qaW0tZnVyeWstcXVlc3Rpb25zLW5lZWQtbGVnYWwtYWN0aW9uLWxpdi1zZXJpZXMtcGxheWVycy8xMDM1NDYwODAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jim Furyk said his heart has always been with the PGA Tour questions legal action by LIV players,"Jim Furyk has been among the most respected PGA Tour veterans for decades a past member of the Policy Board and is now hosting a PGA Tour Champions event at the Timuquana Country club the Constellation Furyk & Friends.

He’s seen the ins and outs of running the Tour under two commissioners and is among the most thoughtful insightful players during his career.

It’s no surprise that Furyk choose his words carefully earlier this week at the Furyk & Friends media day when asked for his take on the current battle raging between the Tour and the LIV Golf Series who has poached 17 PGA Tour players so far and may pick up a half-dozen more after this week’s Tour Championship concludes the FedEx Cup season.

Furyk & Friends: No Phil but field at Timuquana still loaded with Hall of Famers major champions

Next on the tee: Jake Owen stepping in for Lady A at Furyk & Friends concert in Jacksonville

The list includes one of Furyk's best friends on the Tour and the 2021 winner of the inaugural Furyk & Friends Phil Mickelson.

“I played the Tour for a living … it’s where my heart is and where my support is” he said. “I traveled around plenty but did it in November and December. I never really asked for a release. I wanted to focus on the Tour.”

Furyk said other players are free to make their own decisions. But where he drew the line was when nine of the LIV players sued the Tour for anti-trust violations with a court date set for early next year.

“To those players who left it's their choice and they have to do what they think is best for them” he continued. “Where I struggle is with the players who left and turned around and sued the PGA Tour. I struggle with that.”

Furyk said the recent court case where three players were denied access to the FedEx Cup playoffs after being suspended by the Tour offered a club to him that commissioner Jay Monahan was on sound legal footing.

“They can’t have it both ways and that was a significant ruling” he said. “Im happy for the Tour. It helps us as an organization.”

Furyk said he needs more information about a plan leaked from a players-only meeting last week presided over by Tiger Woods for a series of events within the Tour for 60 top-ranked players.

“I need to learn more about that” he said. “My biggest question is how do you gain access and how do you fall out? I need to know a lot more about the process and how it works before I say it sounds like a great idea or I wouldn't be supportive.”

Woods McIlroy join forces

Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy have been the most ardent supporters of the PGA Tour during its struggle with the upstart LIV Golf Series.

They're getting together in another way.

Woods McIlroy and Mike McCarley former NBC president for golf and global strategy from 2011-2021 have joined forces to form TMRW Sports (pronounced ""tomorrow"") described in a release as a company that will build ""technology-focused ventures that feature progressive approaches to sports media and entertainment.

The first venture will be TGL a virtual golf league in partnership with the PGA Tour in which three-player teams will compete in prime time on Monday nights. Woods and McIlroy have already committed and there eventually will be six teams beginning in January of 2024.

Plans are for 15 events that will complement the Tour schedule.

Discussions are underway with broadcast and gaming partners and NBC Sports has the option to be the media partner.

Golfweek reported that the plan was shared at a players-only meeting last week at the BMW Championship which Woods chaired to discuss issues related to LIV Golf's threat to the Tour.

Woods and McIlroy began working on the project more than two years ago.

“I am excited to work with TMRW Sports in bringing people more access to sports"" Woods said in a statement. ""So many athletes entertainers and people I meet from all walks of life share our passion for sports but they also share our desire to build a better future for the next generation of sports fans. Together we can harness technology to bring fresh approaches to the sports we love.”

Tour re-ups with Southern Sentry

The PGA Tour announced extensions of sponsorship deals this week with two long-term partners Sentry and Southern Company.

Sentry the title sponsor of the Tournament of Champions since 2018 has extended its deal with the Tour through 2035. The event in Kapalua Hawaii is reserved for Tour winners from the previous calendar year and any other player who reached this week's Tour Championship.

Southern Company one of the presenting sponsors of this week's Tour Championship has extended its agreement through 2027. The Southern Company has been associated with the event since 1998 and also sponsors the Tour's Payne Stewart Award given each year to a player who best exemplifies character charity and sportsmanship.

Billy Andrade was this year's winner. Past winners have included Furyk Nick Price Jack Nicklaus Arnold Palmer Justin Rose Zach Johnson and Brad Faxon.

The Southern Company to date has contributed $8.9 million to community charities in honor of Payne Stewart and those individuals receiving his namesake award.

Bob Jordan took over as CEO the sixth in the airline’s history on Feb. 1 about seven months after former CEO Gary C. Kelly announced his retirement. Prior to that he had spent more than 30 years with Southwest in 15 different roles ranging from computer programmer a role that he started to director of travel agency accounting.

Speaking on Thursday at the ASTA Global Convention in San Francisco Jordan said “it’s a joy a privilege to be able to be in a role for a company that you love” despite him being a “reluctant CEO.”

“A lot of people aspire to be in this job their whole career…I have always enjoyed work…but I wouldn’t say I have ever been real career-focused” he said. “When the company you love asked you to do a job you step up and do that.”

Southwest is still dealing with post-pandemic challenges but things are improving.

According to Jordan Southwest is now staffed at the same level it was prior to the pandemic after months of heavy hiring. Right now the carrier is hiring at a rate of 1500 people per month including 13200 over the past 12 months and 11000 year-to-date. For comparison 7000 in one year was a pre-pandemic high.

The issue for Southwest and for so many of its competitors in the aviation industry is the difficulty finding and training pilots a position that is obviously crucial to its operations.

According to Helane Becker a long-time airline analyst who spoke to Yahoo at the end of 2021 the industry may need 35000 to 40000 new pilots over the next decade in order to offset retirements and keep pace with travel demands. The industry is now tasked with finding and training those pilots a group that is going to be absolutely crucial not only for the industry to thrive but to continue to expand.

“We are not there with our pilots” he said. “The limiter is capacity—we have limited capacity to train our pilots…that is the issue right now.”

More Engagement with the Travel Trade

Jordan was the only airline CEO to appear onstage at the Global Convention this week which is a long way for an airline like Southwest to come. Southwest had historically taken different routes to success when compared with other carriers including not reporting its bookings through ARC.

“We had a longstanding thought…a longstanding way that we weren’t going to participate in most of the standard ways to do things generally” he said.

Southwest’s last decade or so of growth combined with a rapidly changing travel landscape has made it rethink things.

“At a certain point you get bigger…you have got to have a willingness to challenge our assumptions” he said. Part of that was a lean into business travel with Southwest Business a new section of the airline that was unveiled in 2019.

Corporate has been lagging leisure in the post-pandemic recovery not just for Southwest but for the entire airline industry and the larger travel industry as a whole. For Southwest the leisure business for summer 2022 is already 20% ahead of the same period in 2019 but that doesn’t mean that corporate travel is dead.

“Whether it is this topic or not you learn that when someone says ‘it’s over forever it’s changed forever’ that’s just about the time it changes back” Jordan said. “The business-business is trailing [leisure] but it has still recovered. Will we ever get back to 100%? That’s hard to predict.”

But more relevant for advisors in attendance at ASTA Global Convention it also includes a growing outreach to the travel trade a portion of its business that is now just under 50% of its total sales.

“You can’t ignore that as a place for revenue” he said. “We have the best network the best frequencies we serve the most cities we have terrific hospitality and on-time performance that is what business customers want so we have to be in the right place” which is the travel trade he said.

“I think a brighter future is in front of all of us. People want to travel – we are going to see a continued recovery here.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9zb3V0aHdlc3QtYWlybGluZXMtdC1yZXgtY2FyZ28v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Weird Baggage: Southwest Airlines Recently Checked In A T-Rex Model,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9zb3V0aHdlc3QtYWlybGluZXMtdC1yZXgtY2FyZ28v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmNkZncuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvYWZ0ZXItc3RheWluZy1ob21lLXRvLXJhaXNlLWtpZHMtbm9ydGgtdGV4YXMtZ3JhbmRtb3RoZXItcHVyc3Vlcy1uZXctZHJlYW0tYXMtcGlsb3QtZm9yLXNvdXRod2VzdC1haXJsaW5lcy8zMDU3NTI0L9IBmwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmNkZncuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvYWZ0ZXItc3RheWluZy1ob21lLXRvLXJhaXNlLWtpZHMtbm9ydGgtdGV4YXMtZ3JhbmRtb3RoZXItcHVyc3Vlcy1uZXctZHJlYW0tYXMtcGlsb3QtZm9yLXNvdXRod2VzdC1haXJsaW5lcy8zMDU3NTI0Lz9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After Raising Kids North Texas Grandmother Pursues Her New Dream as a Southwest Pilot,"Life may be best viewed from 30000 feet for Tamaron Nicklas. But for more than two decades she's left the flying to her husband Larry and watched life unfold with her feet planted firmly on the ground.

“I just thought 'I can't do this anymore. I think I need to be home'” recalled Nicklas after having four children in six years.

The daughter of an Air Force pilot Nicklas followed in his footsteps.

“I was in the seventh class of women who graduated from the Air Force Academy once they started accepting women” she said.

There she met her husband. And after graduation Nicklas went to pilot training and learned to fly refuelers while Larry flew fighter jets. Later both became instructors before it was time to start their family.

“I walked away and thought I was done” said Nicklas.

Twenty-four years later with her youngest now out of the house Nicklas overheard a story about a former classmate that inspired her to think about her next chapter.

“Somebody started talking about a gal in a previous class that had been out of flying for many years stayed home with her kids and she had gotten back into flying” said Nicklas. “I thought 'Huh. Could I do that?'""

Nicklas and her husband visited a flying club in Colorado where they lived at the time. She was surprised to be offered a job on the spot as an instructor. It wasn't long before she was hired to teach for the Air Force’s initial flight training program.

""It felt like going home"" she said.

When her grandchildren were born in Wylie she and her husband moved back to North Texas where she took her first commercial job with a regional airline.

“It was all kind of an uphill battle but it just came down to how badly do you want it?"" said Nicklas.

And after two years of adapting to new technology and flying alongside pilots her children’s age Nicklas was hired by Dallas-based Southwest Airlines.

When it came time for her inaugural flight she did it alongside her husband Capt. Nicklas who’s flown for the airline for nearly 30 years.

""I was like ‘Are we going to tell the passengers? Uh do you think they'll like it?' And he right away made the announcement ‘This is my wife's first flight at Southwest Airlines'” she said.

“I’m super proud of her. It's hard enough to just do your everyday job as opposed to something you haven't done in 24 years” Larry told NBC 5.

Now as a newly minted first officer Nicklas hopes she's showing her children and granddaughters that it's never too late to follow your dreams.

“Whatever you want to do just work hard and you're going to do it” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vVVMvYmFsZC1lYWdsZS10cmF2ZWxpbmctbm9ydGgtY2Fyb2xpbmEtYWlycG9ydC13ZWVrL3N0b3J5P2lkPTg4ODU0ODUy0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvVVMvYmFsZC1lYWdsZS10cmF2ZWxpbmctbm9ydGgtY2Fyb2xpbmEtYWlycG9ydC13ZWVrL3N0b3J5P2lkPTg4ODU0ODUy?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why a bald eagle was seen traveling through a North Carolina airport this week,"Why a bald eagle was seen traveling through a North Carolina airport this week

Trainer Daniel Cone has flown so often with exotic animals that he doesn't think much of it. Though a bald eagle sighting at a North Carolina airport turned heads this week with video from the security checkpoint going viral.

""Any time you're working with an exotic animal like a bald eagle you're going to draw more attention"" Cone the assistant director of the St. Louis-based World Bird Sanctuary told ABC News. ""I've traveled with this eagle so many times I don't even think twice about it anymore.""

Clark the Eagle is seen going through security at the Charlotte Douglas International Airport Aug. 22 2022 in an image posted to the TSA Southeast Region's Twitter account. TSA Southeast Region via Twitter

The unexpected guest -- a 19-year-old raptor named Clark -- was captured by a fellow traveler going through airport security on Monday at the Charlotte Douglas International Airport.

""Mans is out here bringing a bald eagle through TSA at CLT Douglas"" Elijah Burke tweeted.

TSA spotlighted the head-turning passenger on Thursday.

""TSA officers are used to seeing an eagle on their uniform as they look over their shoulder but I'm sure the team at @CLTAirport Checkpoint A did a double take when they saw a real one earlier this week"" Mark Howell the spokesperson for the TSA Southeast region wrote on Twitter.

Clark flies between five and seven times a year said Cone who was captured in the photos and footage from the airport holding the nearly 8-pound bird.

In this instance they were traveling on Southwest Airlines back home to St. Louis after helping welcome new freshmen at High Point University. Clark has been coming to the school for over a decade and is also a regular at its Veterans Day ceremony and graduation Cone said.

The sanctuary's trainers typically are taken to a back room while going through security with their animals for more privacy though in this case they were ""a little bit more out in the open"" Cone said.

""We don't mind. Clark doesn't mind certainly"" Cone said. ""He's a ham. He eats it up.""

Howell told ABC News that it's the airlines' discretion when it comes to what animals they'll allow on commercial flights.

The airline notified TSA that the bald eagle would be traveling through on Monday so it could be prepared to conduct the screening.

TSA agents brought the bird to a separate lane where it was removed from its carrier for the screening before being returned Howell said. Passengers were diverted to a different lane he said.

""People probably could have gotten spooked by that"" he said. ""We didn't want to scare anyone inside the checkpoint.""

Clark is trained to spread its wings open and was ""showing off a bit"" during the screening Howell said.

Cone said he always flies Southwest with Clark and the sanctuary's other bald eagles. They have a custom-made carrier for the birds that fits in the bulkhead of the cabin. Clark tends to get the most airtime though Cone said he recently flew out with a male endangered Egyptian vulture so that it could breed at the San Diego Zoo.

Other unique animals that Howell and his TSA colleagues recall going through airport security in recent years include baby penguins with a zoo baby cougars and a long-feathered chicken that was dyed pink Howell said.

""It's not a daily occurrence"" he said. ""It boils down to if the airline is OK with it."""

Expect more strikes.,"Workers at a Starbucks right outside the University of Texas campus in Austin filed to unionize in March and won their election by a landslide in June. It’s now nearing the end of August and union workers say their requests to begin bargaining for a contract have largely been ignored by Starbucks.

Some workers believe the coffee company is using these delays as one of many union-busting tactics meant to prevent workers from exercising their right to organize: The longer it takes to create and agree on a contract with the company the longer it will take for union workers to actually enjoy the benefits of being in a union and the more likely the union movement will lose momentum.

Delays are especially acute at Starbucks. Since the Austin store filed to unionize for example about half of the workers there have left. The turnover at that location is always high since many of its workers are young college students who typically graduate and find higher-paying jobs. The food service industry is also notoriously transient: People don’t usually stay at any given job for long.

That’s why members of the national union Starbucks Workers United say the company is making a difficult situation worse. They accuse the company of firing workers who were outspoken for the union and forcing others to quit with unfair scheduling. Workers in Austin say the company is no longer hiring back students returning from summer break who used to be given priority. The idea workers say is to dilute the union effort with new employees who may not be as supportive or aware of the union making it even harder to organize and establish a contract.

“It is taking longer than we would like longer than we had hoped and longer than it logically and decently should” Lillian Allen a barista at that Austin Starbucks told Recode. “But to expect logic and decency from a large corporation in America is an act of folly.”

The Starbucks store in Austin isn’t the only one facing bargaining delays. Of the more than 220 locations nationwide that have voted to unionize since December only three have made it to the bargaining table to discuss a contract with Starbucks.

Many of those who fought to unionize these Starbucks stores have already left the company. Since Recode reported on the union movement in April a number of the workers featured in that article are no longer working at Starbucks. One got a job as a teacher; one says she was fired for union organizing although the official reason was tardiness; and another left because she couldn’t take how the company was treating workers.

Starbucks spokesperson Reggie Borges told Recode that claims of delay tactics are false. “From the beginning we have been clear that we will respect the process and bargain in good faith with the stores that vote for union representation” he said. Borges added that as of August 1 the company has “engaged or responded to demands to bargain with a majority of the stores and are working through additional requests.”

Workers have said that the company’s responses when they’ve gotten them have been vague and noncommittal. Last week the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) the federal body that oversees union elections issued a complaint against Starbucks for “failing and refusing to bargain collectively and in good faith” with workers at its Roastery in Seattle. A complaint means that the NLRB investigated the union charge and found merit. After the NLRB issued a separate formal complaint in April it took the company to federal court where a judge last week ordered Starbucks to reinstate union workers in Tennessee the company had fired in retaliation for organizing.

“You’re not bargaining in good faith if you’re not bargaining”

Starbucks Workers United has also filed an unfair labor practice charge against Starbucks on behalf of stores nationally saying the company has failed to bargain. The NLRB is currently investigating. In a related letter the union has asked the company to select dates and times between August 22 and September 23 to begin bargaining. After being contacted by Recode about the bargaining delays Starbucks responded to the union but failed to provide a date to meet.

So far the union has filed a total of nearly 300 unfair labor practice charges against Starbucks and the NLRB has issued more than 20 complaints. These processes however are time-consuming and the NLRB’s remedies are hard to enforce so the union is trying a lot of other tactics to get Starbucks to bargain and eventually agree on a contract.

According to some labor experts union contract bargaining should only take about a year. But it’s now apparent that at the current pace negotiations between Starbucks and its unionized employees could take much longer.

“It’s certainly in the interest of the employees and the union to start bargaining as soon as possible” said Risa Lieberwitz a labor law professor at Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations and academic director of its Worker Institute. “Unfortunately where there’s a company that’s been hostile to unionization as Starbucks has been it’s pretty common to see some delays before bargaining gets started.”

“We will make Starbucks give them a contract”

The options workers can pursue to speed up the process are limited. The NLRB can rule that a company is not bargaining in good faith and order it to do so. However if Starbucks doesn’t comply there’s little the NLRB can do to enforce that decision other than taking the company to federal court — a process that’s even more time-consuming.

Because of these challenges Starbucks union workers plan to up the ante. Since January the Starbucks Workers United has already held about 80 strikes with 55 of those happening this summer the union told Recode. That means about a third of all unionized Starbucks have gone on strike. Though many of these strikes were over things like unfair firings and closing union stores union workers say that future strikes will be over bargaining and contracts citing a long list of Starbucks delay tactics ranging from misdirection to old-fashioned taking their sweet time. The company again has denied doing so.

And while the journey to a contract is arduous Starbucks workers are well aware of the uphill battle they face and that they may not be at the company long enough to benefit from a union contract. But they say the fight has never been just about them.

“We’re not just fighting for the baristas who are here now” Allen said. “We’re fighting for all the baristas who will come after because we want this to be as good of a place to work as we know it can be.”

Starbucks is delaying union bargaining

It can be difficult to decipher who is exactly at fault for delaying bargaining since the Starbucks union’s account of the process so far and that of the company are at odds with each other. What experts say however is that the union has every reason to want to bargain while Starbucks has every reason not to.

“They’re grasping at straws. They’re trying every delay tactic that they can think of” Rebecca Givan associate professor at Rutgers University’s labor school said of Starbucks. “You’re not bargaining in good faith if you’re not bargaining.”

Representatives from the three stores that have begun bargaining two in the Buffalo area and one in Mesa Arizona say that Starbucks is applying delay tactics there as well.

Michelle Eisen a barista at the first unionized Starbucks in Buffalo and a member of the Starbucks Workers United national bargaining team said the company has met to bargain about a half dozen times since their first meeting in January but the two parties have made little progress. The initial bargaining session was largely wasted Eisen said as the company presented a list of ground rules she felt were meant to kill time including “no screaming” and “no slamming hands on the table.” The meetings are held on zoom.

In general Eisen said the company will hear a union proposal not really engage with it and then request time to discuss it on their own before punting negotiations to the next meeting. Since this has happened over and over she said the delays have become excessive. She added that while the union has presented more than 10 proposals the company has not engaged those seriously and hasn’t come to a tentative agreement — a building block for creating a contract — on any of them.

“You’re supposed to present these proposals and then there’s a back and forth and the company says ‘Okay we like this part of this proposal’” Eisen said. “None of that happened.”

Meanwhile Starbucks has only made one proposal: a manager’s bill of rights. Eisen said the proposal was pretty much a repeat of the company’s handbook; Starbucks declined to comment on the specifics of the negotiations.

“We’re not just fighting for the baristas who are here now. We’re fighting for all the baristas who will come after.”

Starbucks is now trying to make bargaining sessions happen in person rather than the agreed-upon virtual meetings which can be difficult for a national bargaining committee of workers located all over the US.

The company is also contesting an election near Kansas City that the union won in April. Starbucks alleged that the region’s NLRB office colluded with the union to allow some workers to vote in person during a mail-in ballot election. In response the company asked the NLRB to make all pending and future election votes in person.

Labor experts say in-person elections could favor the company: They can be more intimidating for workers since the employer can supervise who is and isn’t voting and are less convenient for workers who have to travel to polling places and take time off to vote. Voting in person also gives companies more time to hold captive audience meetings mandatory sessions during which the company tries to dissuade workers from joining the union. NLRB rules state that these meetings must cease 24 hours before ballots are mailed out — usually a few weeks prior to the election — rather than 24 hours before an in-person election.

Workers say this call for in-person voting is just one more delay tactic by Starbucks to push off a union contract.

The union is fighting back

Starbucks Workers United says it will continue filing unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB but with an updated approach. Instead of mostly filing for things like retaliation the union will increasingly target the company’s failure to bargain.

To counter the high turnover at Starbucks stores which could weaken their shot at a contract a number of workers told Recode about a concerted effort to bring new workers into the union fold.

Brandi Alduk a barista at a Queens location wants to make Starbucks a better place to work whether or not she stays there after she graduates from college in December. That’s why Alduk and her coworkers are distributing the work involved in bringing new employees up to speed on the union. She is a point person for what’s happening nationally while a coworker who she says is more social and outgoing reaches out to new hires. Those people in turn tell the next people in order to keep any individual worker from burning out.

Alduk also says it’s not hard to convince new people that Starbucks needs a union contract.

“There’s new hires who’ve been there maybe three months and they’re already feeling the wear and tear of the job” she said. “They come and say something to me and then I’m like ‘Yeah girl imagine doing it for three years.’”

One strategy to make Starbucks bargain is attacking the company where it hurts: their reputation and by extension their bottom line. After turning to TikTok to get other Starbucks workers to vote yes on the union union members are creating viral videos calling out Starbucks for failing to bargain. They’ve also teamed with progressive lawmakers like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to magnify their message

Workers have previously highlighted a whole host of other union-busting tactics. In May the company falsely suggested that union workers couldn’t take part in increases to pay and benefits that Starbucks was rolling out company-wide. Labor experts told Recode that such a move amounted to illegally using the company’s economic power to influence whether workers join a union or to discriminate against those who do.

Baristas across the country have also said that Starbucks is systematically firing workers who support the union but saying the firings were for other infractions.

The most notable example of this happened when Starbucks fired the so-called Memphis Seven — five of whom were union committee leaders while the other two were pro-union — allegedly for allowing a TV crew to interview them in their store. The NLRB brought the case to federal court where a judge found that the company “discriminatorily applied its policies to the Memphis Seven when terminating them.”

By broadcasting these infractions the union hopes to get a company that prides itself on being progressive — a reputation that stands to attract progressive customers — to stick to its self-professed values and cooperate with the union. If it doesn’t it could lose customers. The company’s shareholders have said as much and have been pressuring the company to stop union busting.

As goes Starbucks so goes the nation

What’s happening at Starbucks connects to a larger conversation about unions in the US. One of the big criticisms of US labor law is that it makes it immensely difficult to organize a union and even harder to get a contract. That’s one of the reasons union membership has been declining nationwide for decades.

The latest rush of unionizing at unlikely places like Starbucks Amazon Apple and Trader Joe’s however is giving the union movement hope. In the first half of this year union filing petitions were up nearly 60 percent over last year according to the NLRB.

In general Americans approve of unions more than at any time since 1965 according to Gallup. Most recently a survey by career services site Jobcase of non-union skilled and hourly workers found that 70 percent would join a union at their current job and about 40 percent said they’re more likely to do so than they were a few years ago.

But just because people want unions doesn’t mean they’ll happen. Starbucks workers will likely have to raise the stakes to get a contract.

The union could call for boycotts. They could also organize more strikes — what Cornell’s Lieberwitz calls the union’s “most powerful economic weapon.” If baristas at stores around the country refuse to work the company will start losing money very quickly. Work stoppages will also bring greater awareness of the reasons the union is striking in the first place. If Starbucks continues to delay we will likely see a lot more of them.

For now even former Starbucks employees say they’re committed to seeing the fight through to the end.

Workers like Reese Mercado a barista who left their position at a Brooklyn Starbucks earlier this month to work at a charter school are certain they will be able to get the company to collectively bargain.

“We will make Starbucks give them a contract” Mercado said. “We’re not going to keep allowing them to drag their feet in hopes that we’ll give up. We’re not going to allow that to happen.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBicy5vcmcvbmV3c2hvdXIvZWNvbm9teS9sYWJvci1ib2FyZC1maWxlcy1jb21wbGFpbnQtYWdhaW5zdC1zdGFyYnVja3MtZm9yLXdpdGhob2xkaW5nLXJhaXNlcy1mcm9tLXVuaW9uaXplZC1zdG9yZXPSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGJzLm9yZy9uZXdzaG91ci9hbXAvZWNvbm9teS9sYWJvci1ib2FyZC1maWxlcy1jb21wbGFpbnQtYWdhaW5zdC1zdGFyYnVja3MtZm9yLXdpdGhob2xkaW5nLXJhaXNlcy1mcm9tLXVuaW9uaXplZC1zdG9yZXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Labor board files complaint against Starbucks for withholding raises from unionized stores,"The National Labor Relations Board says Starbucks is violating U.S. labor law by withholding pay hikes and other benefits from stores that have voted to unionize.

The labor board’s Seattle office filed the complaint late Wednesday against Starbucks. The complaint is based on charges filed by Workers United the union trying to organize Starbucks’ 9000 company-owned U.S. stores.

The complaint adds to an already lengthy paper trail in the acrimonious relationship between Starbucks — which opposes unionization — and Workers United. More than 220 U.S. Starbucks stores have voted to unionize since late last year.

The complain is one of at least 20 that NLRB regional offices have filed against Starbucks alleging unfair labor practices. Starbucks has also filed complaints against the board and the union. Last week the company asked the NLRB to halt union elections entirely saying it has evidence that a regional office improperly coordinated with union officials. A decision in that case is pending.

In the case filed Wednesday the NLRB said Starbucks violated labor law by offering raises and benefits — including increased training career development opportunities expanded tipping and even looser dress code policies — only to non-union stores.

Starbucks announced the $200 million in added worker pay and benefits in May after a series of meetings with workers around the country. At the time Starbucks interim CEO Howard Schultz said U.S. labor law requires union stores to negotiate their own contracts with the company.

“We do not have the same freedom to make these improvements at locations that have a union” Schultz said in a conference call with investors.

Starbucks reiterated that argument in a statement Thursday.

“Wages and benefits are mandatory subjects of the collective bargaining process” the company said. It rejects the union’s argument that it could offer the wage and benefit enhancements to unionized stores at any time.

But in its complaint the NLRB’s regional office said Starbucks’ action violates laws that prohibit interfering with employees’ rights to organize.

The complaint seeks back pay for affected employees. It also would require Schultz to hold an employee meeting and a read a statement explaining workers’ right to organize.

The regional complaint will be heard by an administrative law judge at the NLRB.

The restaurant will be built on Wegmans Drive east of PNC Bank.

The one-story 2554-square-foot building will have a drive-through lane and patio. An adjacent parking lot will accommodate 25 vehicles.

Closing in September:Erie Quaker Steak & Lube

Starbucks did not respond to a Times-News query on when construction might begin and when the new store might open.

The development plan for the project was prepared by KU Resources of Duquesne Pennsylvania and was approved by Millcreek Township supervisors on Tuesday. The Millcreek Township Planning Commission recommended the plan for supervisors' approval on Aug. 2.

The plan leaves room for another development between PNC and Starbucks. No plan for that parcel has yet been submitted to the township officials said.

The new Starbucks will be the fifth in the Erie area. There are two locations in Millcreek in the Millcreek Plaza near the Millcreek Mall and at 2205 W. 12th St. and two in Summit Township at 6801 Peach St. and in the Target store at 6700 Peach St.

Starbucks coffee also is sold at other retail outlets including the cafe in the Barnes & Noble store at 5909 Peach St. in Millcreek.

With Lincoln and Roosevelt avenues quickly behind her the San Bernardino City Council member soon passes 16th Street as she approaches an unceremonious dead end at Hanford.

And with that a major north-south thoroughfare in the westside of town disappears.

“Every day” Calvin said this week “that street gives me heartburn.”

Plans to extend State/University 1.5 miles south to Foothill Boulevard have been on the books for at least 20 years making the job the second oldest in the city.

Next month a Riverside construction company will begin the first phase of the project extending State to Base Line Street.

“It is monumental news” Calvin who represents the area said this week. “It was past due. We live in a food desert. There’s nowhere to shop there isn’t any entertainment. We’ve got to go to 7-Eleven for a cup of coffee. We’re the only ward without a Starbucks.

“That’s not what this community wants.”

With precious few places nearby to buy groceries grab a bite or shop for leisure westside residents presently drive to Rialto Renaissance Marketplace to spend their money Calvin said.

Connecting State to Foothill is a critical step toward keeping those dollars in San Bernardino.

Rikki Van Johnson who represented the 6th Ward from 2004 to 2016 pushed City Hall to make extending the major thoroughfare south to Route 66 a priority. While in office the former councilman had a vision of transforming the area along State to what Rialto now has a few miles west.

“Something to bring in dollars” Johnson recalled this week. “But (city leaders) didn’t want to put value in the 6th Ward. They didn’t understand that it was value for the city as well.”

The $7.4 million State Street Extension Project will bring a new four-lane divided roadway to the area with medians sidewalks and storm drains. The new roadway is meant to improve connectivity to the 210 decrease cut-through traffic in residential neighborhoods and provide better access to Arroyo Valley High School and Anne Shirrells Park.

Calvin commended City Manager Rob Field Public Works Director Daniel Hernandez and Deputy Public Works Director Alex Qishta for moving the long-awaited project forward.

“I’m happy these folks are on board and they’re beginning to envision what this really could look like” Calvin said. “But I’m making a whole city over here in the 6th Ward because we were left this way. Whether it was intentional or not now it plays out for the best interest of the 6th Ward and the remainder of the city will benefit as well.”

Additional phases will extend State beyond Base Line to Foothill. However that job will require two bridges over the Lytle Creek Basin and tons of funding.

Nonetheless Calvin and Johnson foresee sit-down restaurants a bank or two perhaps even a gas station and somewhere to shop finally landing in the 6th Ward once work concludes.

“I want to be able to have a bank in my community” Calvin said. “I want to be able to shop in my community. I want to go to dinner in my community. I need a sign as you’re approaching University Parkway on the 210 that says: ‘Exit here’ to go to this restaurant this restaurant Starbucks gas banks.

“I need for it to come up on people’s GPS” Calvin added. “Gas. Food. You can exit right here on University Parkway.”

With State being the last completed north-south artery in San Bernardino Johnson said “might as well put all the bells and whistles on it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb2VyaWUuY29tL3N0b3J5L2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjIvMDgvMjUvZ3JlYXQtbGFrZXMtaW5zdXJhbmNlLW93bmVyLXBldGUtemFwaGlyaXMtcmVub3ZhdGluZy1jaXRpemVucy1iYW5rLTEydGgtc3RhdGUtc3RyZWV0cy1lcmllLXBhLzY1NDA4MTg4MDA3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Great Lakes Insurance owner moves ahead with renovating Citizens Bank,"This article is part of a recurring series that will provide updates on the status of properties of interest in the Erie area. Have a suggestion? Email jmartin@timesnews.com

In a busy construction season few Erie projects have been more visible than the work taking place at the former Citizens Bank building on the northwest corner of West 12th and State streets.

The building has been owned since 2017 by Pete Zaphiris who is both a developer and owner of Erie-based Great Lakes Insurance.

Ongoing construction on the first and second floors of the building will provide new offices for the insurance agency. Zaphiris said he hopes to move more than 40 employees into the building within a few months.

Zaphiris who declined to provide an estimate of construction costs plans to keep the company's existing headquarters at 3205 Peach St. for future expansion.

But back downtown the 50000-square-foot building at 1128 State St. is circled by construction fencing and the sidewalk along 12th Street has been closed.

Behind the scenes most of the plumbing electrical and mechanical work have been completed Zaphiris said.

""The steel superstructure starts going up at the end of August or early September"" he said. ""Our timetable (for completion) is late November or December. It could be January.""

The project's completion date will likely hinge in large part on supply chain issues that have affected building projects in Erie and across the country he said.

The building's exterior once dominated by concrete will get a new look with the installation of 11-foot glass panels.

New building takes shape

""It's transformational"" Zaphiris said of the project at one of Erie's busiest intersections. ""People are going to start seeing that building take shape.""

Zaphiris said Great Lakes employees who have been given tours of the construction site in small groups are excited about the move.

An extensive gutting and restoration of the building's third floor was completed in 2019 to provide space for the Erie Regional Chamber and Growth Partnership which took up residence in December of that year.

Transforming 12th Street

The transformation of the 52-year-old building is one of several projects in the West 12th Street corridor that Zaphiris has been working on since 2018.

Zaphiris who bought the former General Tire building at 121 W. 12th St. completed a top-to-bottom restoration of the building to create a new clinic and administrative offices for Life-Northwestern Pennsylvania which helps senior citizens remain in their own homes.

Good question:What does Erie's Tom Hagen plan to do with former Sophia's Tavern? Here's what's not on tap

His company also built a new building at 25 W. 12th St. to serve as a branch office for Citizens Bank.

Zaphiris said his next project will be to resume work on the former Metropolitan Dance Club at 144 W. 13th St. The 100-year-old brick building will be used as a combination of commercial space and apartments.

""That is coming"" he said. ""One project after another.""

As one group went over music and movement with choreographer Lisa Markowitz and musical director Dylan Cisneros in the venue’s theater space other students were upstairs in the costume shop trying on clothing that would transport them to late 1800s Germany — the setting for the production focusing on teenage life in a restrictive society where grown-ups hold all the cards.

Amid the controlled chaos director Olivia Theilemann (who’s also BAAY’s artistic director) took a few minutes to talk about the play and the debut of the State Street Theatre Company. Tailored to local youth ages 15–18 the program focuses on content meant to challenge musical theatre students and prepare them for collegiate-level work.

“Spring Awakening” fits the bill. Dealing with hot-button issues including depression suicide parental (and teacher) abuse abortion morality mortality and sexuality the Tony Award-winning musical is known for its frank look at what it takes to survive adolescence. Throw in a rock and roll score and the show propels actors and audiences forward in time and offers them a contemporary glimpse at the topics at hand.

Parental consent was required for participating cast members and Theilemann said they’ve been clear with the community that the material varies widely from BAAY’s typical song-and-dance fare for younger students. Parental guidance at the performances is strongly recommended and although much of the more explicit content will be implied instead of seen audiences should still expect strong language and plot points that pack an emotional wallop.

“As we select these summer shows going forward we will always choose pieces that are going to be challenging in content and quality” Theilemann 29 said noting the play will be performed at Mount Baker Theatre’s intimate Walton Theatre Aug. 26–28 and Sept. 2–4 as a way to provide the students with even more pro-level pointers.

“They’re going to march into the Mount Baker Theatre on Monday for our tech rehearsals and they’re going to be working with professional technicians” she said beaming with pride. “We’re really trying to set them up so they know what to expect if they want to continue this.”

Theilemann said “Spring Awakening” is personal for her. She saw a touring production of the musical when she was in high school and has been obsessed with it ever since. Knowing it was a script that likely wouldn’t get chosen in a public school she got the go-ahead from BAAY’s board and other staff members and is thrilled to be bringing it to life.

“It’s a story that is about teenagers and is for teenagers”

Theilemann said. “The fact that we could give teenagers a very realist really exciting theater experience with a script that they might not ever get to work with in their lifetime is why I chose it.”

For those not in the know Theilemann explained that the play focuses on a group of teens who live in a provincial town in 1890s Germany. They are all going through normal teenage stuff but because there’s a lot of religious presence shame and embarrassment around sexuality and mental health is exacerbated. When a song starts she said there will be a dramatic light shift and all of a sudden it will be as if attendees are at a contemporary alternative rock concert.

By bringing the action into the modern day Theilemann said it shows how the problems and struggles of teenagers have remained the same through the ages. But the issues they’re going through she noted may not always be easy to watch.

“There’s a lot of potential for people to have really strong emotional reactions to the play” Theilemann said.

“But that’s kind of why theater exists. It’s really powerful to watch somebody going through something that you can really relate to in this beautiful artistic way right in front of you.”

While the actors involved in “Spring Awakening” are taking the subject matter seriously it was evident during the rehearsal process that they’re also having fun. In between blocking scenes they discussed everything from the merits of the musical “Hamilton” to the recent hubbub at the PRCA rodeo at the Northwest Washington Fair what it felt like to take deep breaths and then let out a giant “moooooooo” and coffee preferences.

“Starbucks be damned McDonald’s coffee is really good” one cast member said laughing.

But when Theilemann asked the students to focus and walked through the blocking with them they paid attention and even offered their insight. Among those speaking up were Ethan Riggs a longtime BAAY student who plays one of the main characters Melchior Gabor. Riggs opined that he wanted to try two different versions of a scene involving a weapon.

Theilemann acknowledged all ideas and was open to discussing script changes but remained firm in her direction. She also ensured cast members were comfortable with lines involving cursing or prickly plot points (they were).

Although “Spring Awakening” stars local teens and is about the trials and tribulations of adolescence Theilemann said the performances are not just for youth. She encourages community members both young and old to see the show.

“To me this is a once-in-a-lifetime story to experience” she said. “I think any person can see themselves in at least one of the characters whether it’s a teenager who’s going through mental health struggles or an adult who remembers being a teenager who’s going through mental health struggles. There’s something for every audience member to emotionally latch on to while also experiencing beautiful imagery acting and singing.”

“Spring Awakening” shows Aug. 26–28 and Sept. 2–4 at the Mount Baker Theatre’s Walton Theatre 104 N. Commercial St. Tickets are $12–$20.

Under an enforcement action filed Wednesday in Ramsey County District Court Welch Charities must dissolve and its president Arturo Eguia is banned from operating a charity having access to charitable assets or soliciting donations in Minnesota.

Eguia 46 of St. Paul started the all-volunteer nonprofit in 2013 to provide school supplies to low-income children. It raised money through Indian Bike Week an annual motorcycle ride and festival.

Welch Charities must turn over its assets to another nonprofit before dissolving. In an interview Thursday Eguia said he is giving the money to a Native American church in South Dakota.

Eguia denied misspending the charity's funds and said he was unable to access documentation from years ago to prove the expenses were for charitable costs.

""It wasn't used for any personal funds"" he said.

Eguia said he was in the process of dissolving the nonprofit on his own before the state took action.

His attorney Ferdinand Peters said the state couldn't prove the allegations because the investigation by Ellison's office was incomplete. As part of the settlement Eguia and Welch Charities neither admit nor deny the allegations.

Peters said Eguia ""had done maybe some sloppy bookkeeping but he didn't do anything wrong that was illegal.""

The Attorney General's Office he said wants ""to show an example to other charities but sometimes they get it wrong and they smear a charity through the mud that just didn't have the money to continue to fight them to actually go to a trial.""

A spokesperson for the Attorney General's Office said the investigation took 15 months and ""the facts ... are beyond sufficient to establish the violations that Mr. Eguia himself acknowledged by signing the settlement.""

The Attorney General's Office which regulates nonprofits in the state began investigating Welch Charities in 2021 after it failed to file required documents. The state said the charity wasn't properly managed followed no policies or procedures and had a board that never met or conducted oversight.

According to the state registration fees from the annual motorcycle ride merchandise sales and donations amounted to more than $142000 from 2017 to 2021. Of that sum $12200 was spent on charitable items according to the court document. An additional nearly $37000 allegedly was used to pay Eguia's personal expenses including more than $5900 in cash withdrawals $1434 on hotels $878 on restaurants and bars and $253 on a pest control company.

Eguia ""took advantage of Minnesotans' and motorcycle riders' trust and generosity"" Ellison said in a statement.

At nearly 34000 acres St. Croix State Park is the largest state park in Minnesota. Located east of Hinckley the park offers access to two rivers: the St. Croix and the Kettle. Ten other streams flow through the park; three of these Hay Creek Little Hay Creek and Crooked Creek are designated trout streams.

Fishing is a popular activity among park visitors. Anglers can fish for a variety of species in the rivers including smallmouth bass walleye northern pike catfish suckers and lake sturgeon. Crooked Creek is stocked with rainbow and brown trout annually in the spring. Hay Creek has a natural brook trout population and is considered the best trout stream in Pine County. However the banks of Hay Creek have thick growth of brush in many places making access and fishing difficult.

Hinckley fisheries staff have been working with park managers Rick Dunkley and Josh Zaudtke to identify areas to develop access trails and clear streamside brush along Hay Creek. What was needed was a crew that was available and willing to do the work. That’s where the Challenge Incarceration Program (CIP) came in. Based at the Minnesota Correctional Facility-Willow River CIP allows non- violent offenders to participate in a rigorous “boot camp” style program to develop life skills through educational vocational and restorative justice opportunities. Work crews perform a variety of tasks for community service. On May 18 a crew came to the park and cleared brush to create new trails off the park road and the Matthew Lourey State Trail. The men were very hard-working; in less than 5 hours they had created 5 new trails and access points along Hay Creek. Follow up work will be done in late summer or fall to create even more brush-free areas along the stream. These trails will

need to be maintained periodically as brush grows back.

Signs have been posted to mark the new trails; maps are available in the park office."

August 25 2022

Purdue University Northwest (PNW) faculty staff students and collaborators with PNW’s Center for Innovation through Visualization and Simulation (CIVS) visited Pittsburgh Pennsylvania during the summer to attend the Association for Iron & Steel Technology 2022 conference and exposition (AISTech 2022). They presented eight technical papers demonstrated CIVS projects and won three prestigious awards at the industry’s premier technology event.

Chenn Zhou NIPSCO Distinguished Professor of Engineering Simulation and director of CIVS was recognized as the AIST Distinguished Member and Fellow one of only two this year chosen from more than 18500 members to receive the esteemed award.

“I am deeply honored and humbled” said Zhou. “I very much appreciate the people who nominated and endorsed me for this great honor along with the AIST board and staff all of my collaborators and sponsors as well as colleagues and students at Purdue Northwest.”

CIVS graduate research assistant John Rosser won first place in the AIST graduate student poster contest. His poster “Reducing Blast Furnace CO2 Emissions with H2” focused on the injection of hydrogen gas into blast furnaces with the aim of reducing the process’s significant carbon footprint.

CIVS researchers and collaborators Nicholas Walla Zhankun Luo Chenn Zhou Bin Chen (Purdue Fort Wayne) and Yury Krotov (Steel Dynamics Inc.) received third place for the 2022 Hunt-Kelly Outstanding Paper Award for their paper “Smart Ladle: AI-Based Tool for Optimizing Casting Temperature.”

“These awards once again demonstrate how CIVS plays a leading role in not only generating original new knowledge and understanding of critical processes in the steel industry but also facilitating the transfer of advances in research to industrial practice” said Dietmar Rempfer interim dean of the College of Engineering and Sciences at PNW. “The meaningful engagements that these projects provide for our students serve to fulfill an important part of the mission of Purdue Northwest as the premier metropolitan university of Northwest Indiana.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wZW5wci5jb20vbmV3cy8yNzE0ODcwL21ldGFsLWhpZ2gtdGliaWFsLW9zdGVvdG9teS1odG8tcGxhdGVzLW1hcmtldC1pcy1wcm9qZWN0ZWTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Metal High Tibial Osteotomy (HTO) Plates Market is Projected to Gain Significant Value by 2028: DePuy Synthes (J & J ...,"Metal High Tibial Osteotomy (HTO) Plates Market is Projected to Gain Significant Value by 2028: DePuy Synthes (J & J) Arthrex B.

The results of a new survey by Forbes shows Michigan-based organizations have an edge in the state when it comes to employee satisfaction from education to automotive to utilities.

This is Forbes’ fourth survey of the best employers evaluating 1382 companies throughout the United States and ranking them in each state and Washington D.C. The magazine partnered with market research company Statista to survey 70000 Americans working for businesses with at least 500 employees.

There are 75 ranked companies in Michigan. Other states have longer lists up to 101 depending on the size of their workforce.

Here we go. Coming in at No. 15 in Michigan is the University of Michigan Health System employing 29771 people and headquartered in Ann Arbor. This is not the be confused with the University of Michigan which you’ll see farther down the list if you stick around.

At No. 14 we have the U.S. Postal Service. It’s one of the oldest - founded in 1775 (that’s before the Declaration of Independence) - government services. USPS employs 630000 people and is headquartered in Washington D.C.

Another Michigan company joins the list at No. 13. Gentex is an automotive supplier headquartered in Zeeland. It employs 4998 people. The company recently announced a $300 million expansion that will create 500 jobs.

No. 12 is also in the automotive industry but not homegrown: Toyota North America.

Ford Motor Company comes in at No. 11. The Dearborn-based automaker has 26000 employees. However earlier this week the company announced plans to cut 3000 jobs most of them salaried and in Michigan.

Detroit-based utility DTE Energy ranks as the No. 10 best employer in Michigan. It has 10000 employees.

Bosch an engineering and manufacturing firm out of Farmington Hills comes in at No. 9 with its 35300 employees.

Atlanta Ga.-based Delta Air Lines ranks No. 8 in Michigan.

Health care equipment company Stryker based in Kalamazoo comes in at No. 7. It has 24000 employees.

Consumers Energy is the second utility on the list at No. 6. Based in Jackson it has 9778 employees.

The next three are not Michigan-based companies. At No. 5 we have the U.S. Department of Defense then JPMorgan Chase at No. 4 and automotive supplier Flex-N-Gate comes in at No. 3.

No. 2 on the list is Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan. The Detroit-based insurance company has 8100 employees.

Without further ado the No. 1 best employer in Michigan according to Forbes is the University of Michigan headquartered in Ann Arbor with 29774 employees.

Bonus! Because this reporter knows you’re wondering: Michigan State University came at No. 69.

IMCRC delves into why sovereign manufacturing capability has become such a hot topic and how Australia can accelerate its capacity to achieve this.

The concept of sovereign manufacturing capability has become a hot topic in Australia and rightfully so as the double hit of the pandemic and geopolitical issues has exposed significant gaps in Australian manufacturing capability and capacity.

‘Sovereign capability’ was a phrase more typically associated with specific industries notably the defence sector. Now in the face of international volatility it is more commonly used to describe the building of Australia’s national scale depth and resilience.

To succeed in this endeavour we need to focus on developing industrial capability in specific targeted sectors where we have a comparative advantage (including through access to local inputs and resources) and where manufacturing acts as an enabling capability.

We need to understand where we are different from other developed and industrialised nations and accommodate this in our policies strategies and investments.

This requires accepting that we can’t make everything domestically. As a nation of less than 30 million people this would be neither economical nor feasible and may also distract and dilute investment into areas where we can become global leaders such as clean and new energy solutions health and medical manufacturing food critical minerals value adding and specialised areas such as space and defence.

While we have pockets of manufacturing excellence and exemplars across the nation most of our manufacturers are micro-businesses focusing primarily on production.

The end of passenger vehicle production in Australia was one of the drivers of this need to transform. With it we saw the loss of significant industrial infrastructure where global multinationals drove best practice through tiered supply chains creating opportunities for local manufacturers to export and expand internationally as part of a global network. In its prime many suppliers to Australia’s automotive industry demonstrated our capability for production but perhaps more importantly for design engineering innovation logistics operational and financial management etc. – and did this at very aggressive price points to match global competition.

So with these differences and challenges how can Australia accelerate building sovereign manufacturing capability and capacity?

Build design and engineering capability

The drive for Australian Made must ideally also be a drive for Australian designed engineered and owned. This is critical – we must invest in our ability to create uniqueness by designing and engineering complex products processes services and solutions that are significantly value add digitally enabled and exportable. This will drive much-needed business investment in research development and innovation. This is not only applicable for industry. Research organisations also need to invest in design and engineering capability ideally through partnerships with industry.

When we look at our well-known success stories from Cochlear and ResMed to Carbon Revolution RØDE and Blackmagic Design we see that robust design and engineering capabilities often honed through research and development (R&D) lie at the heart of their achievements. This is something we have seen echoed through the pandemic with companies like Grey Innovation pulling together consortiums to design engineer and locally manufacture critical items like ventilators and Whiteley Corporation creating first-to-market COVID cleaning solutions. And as Australia moves to increase sovereign manufacturing capability there needs to be a renewed focus on investing in design engineering and innovative R&D to really harness the opportunities within nascent sectors like critical minerals clean energy and health.

Industry 4.0 investment

With the world rapidly digitalising we can’t ignore the opportunity across industry to embrace Industry 4.0 to drive productivity and capture and create value. Much more can be done to educate and incentivise around this including businesses being willing to collaborate to develop and implement Industry 4.0 solutions and business models.

Government both as catalyst and purchaser

We need a long-term vision strategy and industrial policy with appropriate incentives and catalysts to lead Australia’s manufacturing industry towards it. The government is already driving discussions around local content requirements including for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). At this stage it is still primarily about production but its now timely to embrace the real opportunity for Australia to build capacity and capability which is in design and engineering. Local content requirements for design would likely lead to local production and opportunities for Australian supply chains and may also incentivise startups.

SME Leadership and skills development

Often we look at skills development on a technical level particularly for SMEs. Rarely do we consider investing in skills development and education at the business owner or leader level to help them drive personal development training investment and innovation. Specific programs are needed to lift the capability and capacity of manufacturing SMEs to develop innovation digital and green skills as well as to embrace design thinking and collaborative partnerships.

Growing the proportion of medium-sized manufacturers

There is plenty of evidence that medium-sized companies provide the critical mass capability and ambition to drive innovation productivity and growth. IMCRC’s futuremap® data shows the appetite for investment Industry 4.0 and innovation is more active in a medium-sized company than in a large or small company. At this size the business is more likely to have the management structure credibility and finances in place to develop supply chains and export opportunities support growth and collaborate. Thus programs need to be developed specifically to increase the proportion of medium-sized companies that have the maturity to invest in and play leading roles in their sectors.

Retaining local talent and creating opportunities

We need to encourage and find ways to retain our talent intellectual property and investment opportunities within Australia and not lose them overseas. We have to create a more positive perception or ‘brand’ of Australian manufacturing positioning it as attractable and investable. This is needed at many levels to interest primary school children in design and manufacturing through to attracting equity and foreign investors.

Encourage more foreign investment into Australia

At first encouraging foreign investment might seem at odds with building sovereign capability. Sovereign capability can be built as ‘all Australian’ but it will take a very long time and by being insular we also risk losing connections with and relevance to global supply chains and activities.

To grow our sovereign capability we need to rethink the role and opportunity of foreign direct investment in Australia and we need to do this quickly. Many nations are thinking this way and are actively attracting big investors into their countries. The potential benefits are enormous. You need only look as far as our defence sector to see that sovereign capability can and should be built in strategic targeted areas and in partnerships with nations and key industrial players within those nations.

Multinational defence primes have played a significant role in strengthening the capacity and capability of Australian SMEs throughout the entire supply chain. As an example IMCRC’s collaborative R&D investment with BAE Systems Australia is driving Industry 4.0 into shipyard manufacturing and supply chains. The project with Flinders University has led to the establishment of the Line Zero and Factory of the Future facilities at Tonsley in South Australia – which is building local talent and creating long-term opportunities for local SMEs.

And while programs of national significance (such as the Hunter Class Frigate Program) have a large role to play in attracting foreign investment there are many other reasons as to ‘why Australia’. We have a long and proud history of manufacturing. We have a rich abundance of academic and research capability. We typically share common rules of law and standards of governance respect for intellectual property as well as common languages with other industrialised nations and strategic partners. Foreign businesses who invest into Australia often only strengthen that investment over time.

By aligning with key investment sectors as outlined by the new Labor Government we have a unique advantage. Take for instance medical manufacturing. Since 2016 global medical technology and Fortune 500 company Stryker and IMCRC have been co-investing in a five-year $18 million R&D collaboration with RMIT University University of Technology Sydney St Vincent’s Hospital and others. By enabling Stryker to invest in and develop these partnerships and undertake innovative R&D IMCRC’s project has led to Stryker establishing its first Australian R&D facility in Queensland. The medical research lab is designed to strategically complement Stryker’s global business while growing critical medtech design and manufacturing capability here in Australia. Opening this September Stryker’s facility will create many high-skilled local jobs in engineering science clinical research and data analytics.

In addition to job creation foreign investments also generate opportunities for SMEs to develop the capability know-how and pathways to compete on the global stage.

There’s no doubt that Australia’s focus on sovereign manufacturing is poised to create significant opportunities for our manufacturing sector including for SMEs but we must continue to think global while investing local.

As IMCRC has found with the right business model incentives and partnerships Australian manufacturing can be both attractive and investable for local SMEs and foreign businesses. This is also how Australian manufacturing can be thriving relevant and globally integrated."

Jason Furman chief economic advisor for then-President Barack Obamathat the move is the equivalent of ""[p]ouring roughly half trillion dollars of gasoline on the inflationary fire that is already burning is reckless.""Goldman Sachs on the other hand expects the move to have a minimum economic impact. In a research paper distributed Thursday the investment bank projected that the program would increase gross domestic product by 0.1% next year and by less in the years ahead with the inflationary impact charting a similar path.Some officials and commentators have even suggested that the White House's plan could be deflationary as it calls for an end to the federal student loan repayment moratorium implemented at the beginning of the pandemic. Borrowers will have to resume making monthly payments starting in January.Unlike stimulus payments or even tax credits there is no transfer of money to borrowers only a reduction of debt on their personal balance sheets. This raises the question of whether these individuals feel wealthier and if so whether that induces more of the demand that the Federal Reserve isDerek Tang co-founder of the Washington-based research firm Monetary Policy Analytics expects demand to be little changed as a result of the debt cancellation. Not only have borrowers been able to forgo their loan payments during the moratorium but many have long priced some degree of loan forgiveness into their personal budgets because Biden promised it on the campaign trail in 2020.""There was already a lot of speculation that at some point during the Biden presidency these loans would be forgiven"" Tang said. ""A lot of people might have been counting on it halfway already so the resulting impact on their spending patterns might not be as big as if this was like a complete surprise.""Still Tang said even a modest increase in demand could warrant additional action by policymakers in Washington especially sincehave done little to cool off a red-hot labor market.""If it does end up being a little bit more inflationary than we expect especially next year it might have an impact on what the Fed does because the Fed is trying to bring inflation down to 2% and every 10th of a percent counts"" he said. ""Even if this is going to generate a 10th more inflation that's going to make the Fed's job a little bit more difficult. The Fed can only bring inflation down by reducing demand and what that means is it's going to have to push the labor market down a little bit more to get what it wants.""If demand is to rise in the immediate aftermath of the debt cancellation it is most likely to center on credit-intensive purchases such as homes and automobiles which have already seen significant price increases in recent years due to supply and demand imbalances. Yet even skeptics of the policy do not expect this to be a significant driver of overall inflation.Neal McCluskey director of the Center for Educational Freedom at the libertarian think tank Cato Institute said he expects a near-term inflation increase following the cancellation will be ""real but small"" and likely hard to isolate among the various other factors that have caused prices to rise this past year — including fiscal stimulus programs and supply chain bottlenecks.In the long run McCluskey said the ripple effects of the Biden administration's action on student debt will have a significant inflationary impact on the world of higher education. He expects future students will be more willing to take on debt under the expectation that it will be forgiven and universities in turn will increase their prices.""Many people will look at student loans now and say 'Well why shouldn't I take out student loans and take out more?' Because once there's a precedent for cancellation they can say 'OK why did you forgive them three years ago and not now?' "" McCluskey said. ""Colleges will see that and raise their prices not just because they can but because they have things they think would be valuable to do and they need money to do it. That's one way to get it.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
SNPS,Synopsys,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA4LzI0LzEtbGl0dGxlLWtub3duLWNoaXAtc3RvY2staXMtYS10b3AtYnV5LXJpZ2h0LW5vdy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,1 Little-Known Chip Stock Is a Top Buy Right Now,"Synopsys offers growth from the semiconductor industry but in software form.

One of the most important reasons to avoid investing in semiconductor stocks is because of industry cyclicity. As technology trends ebb and flow spending on chips in the global economy can be highly volatile. A couple of years of boom time can be followed by sales droughts -- leading to some wild swings in stock prices.

Nevertheless as volatile a space as it might be it's also profitable -- global demand for chips is poised to rise over the next decade. That's why Synopsys (SNPS 1.08%) might be worth a look. It offers the growth of the chip industry but with the more steady predictable financial results of a software business. Here's why it's a top buy right now.

A critical industry partner you've never heard of

Synopsys specializes in what's known as electronic design automation (EDA). EDA is software that helps a semiconductor company design and test chips. Additionally Synopsys also provides chip design templates that a company could license and incorporate into its own custom design. This helps simplify the process of engineering new chips and computing systems by utilizing a tried-and-true blueprint in areas not needing new work.

Synopsys and Cadence Design Systems (CDNS 0.43%) are the top two players in the EDA space although Synopsys says there are other software companies that dabble in this area too. Many chip designers out there also have their own licensing and software businesses -- like Nvidia and Qualcomm for example. Thus some of Synopsys' customers are also competitors.

However due to the subscription software-based nature of its business model Synopsys offers investors far more steady predictable returns than chip companies themselves that rely on final hardware sales. While Synopsys may not be the fastest-growing business in the semiconductor world it hasn't been prone to some of the wild swings in sales other top chip companies have been over the last decade.

Steady growth highly profitable

Besides enjoying steady growth in revenue over time Synopsys is also highly profitable. Over the last 12 months the company has generated $1.58 billion in free cash flow a very healthy free cash flow profit margin of nearly 32%. And as the company expanded over the last decade free cash flow has grown at an even faster rate than revenue. That's exactly the kind of dynamic investors want to see: better operating efficiency as a company scales up.

The company's outlook for fiscal 2022 is solid as well even as the overall chip industry begins to enter a cyclical downturn in some areas (most notably in consumer electronics). Synopsys said it expects revenue to be at least $1.26 billion in its fiscal 2022 fourth quarter up at least 10% year over year.

That expectation will cap off a stellar year for Synopsys. Thanks to a few tuck-in acquisitions and general chip industry growth revenue should exceed $5 billion for the year an increase of nearly 20% from 2021.

Also of note Synopsys reported over $1.5 billion in cash and short-term investments on hand at the end of July offset by minimal debt of just $22 million. In addition to free cash flow generation that provides a nice cushion from which the company can make other small acquisitions of software peers and repurchase stock. On that latter note Synopsys has returned $717 million in excess cash to shareholders through the first nine months of fiscal 2022 in the form of share repurchases.

As of this writing Synopsys trades for 33.6 times enterprise value to free cash flow. Despite chip industry headwinds this software design and tech licensor is a great buy right now if you're looking for steady profitable growth from the semiconductor industry over the next decade.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hbHBoYXN0cmVldC5jb20vZWFybmluZ3MtaGlnaGxpZ2h0cy1vZi1hdXRvZGVza3MtcTItMjAyMy1yZXBvcnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Earnings: Highlights of Autodesk’s Q2 2023 report,"Design software company Autodesk Inc.

While we often use the terms interchangeably authorization and authentication are two separate functions. Authentication is the process of verifying who a user is and authorization is the process of verifying what they have access to. Programmers who need to access the configurable elements of an API need authorization for access but their authentication credentials should not allow them to change the way the two computers interact with one another.

Authenticating a client or a user to an API is crucial because the API uses that client or a user identity to decide whether an operation is permitted. Client authentication is vastly different from user authentication. Clients are automated so authenticating them on every request to the API is not a problem. Users however do not want to have to provide credentials for every API call. That’s why user authentication typically happens once during a session. Once authenticated a user’s authenticated state is propagated on subsequent requests.

How APIs are breached

Application programming interfaces (APIs) enable computer programs to communicate with each other. And because APIs hide the internal details of how a system works while providing a safe surface where systems can communicate and perform operations the mechanism programmers use to access APIs is of crucial importance.

API security rests on proper configuration of authentication and authorization mechanisms. Let’s look at a recent breach as an example. In July 2022 researchers discovered a set of 3207 mobile apps leaking valid consumer keys and consumer secret credentials for the Twitter API. When developers integrate mobile apps with Twitter they use authentication keys to authorize their apps to interact with the Twitter API. When users associate their Twitter accounts with the mobile app the same keys will enable the app to act on behalf of those users allowing them to log in via Twitter to create tweets send DMs and use the site.

The kind of data leak found by the researchers occurs when app developers embed their authentication keys in the Twitter API during development but forget to remove them when their mobile app is released. In this case these stored credentials could allow a hacker to access users’ direct messages remove or add followers access account settings change display pictures and perform all tweet actions including create delete retweet and like. They could also allow a threat actor to use these exposed tokens to create Twitter verified accounts with large numbers of followers to promote fake news malware campaigns cryptocurrency scams and more.

API authentication and authorization vulnerabilities

The OWASP foundation has a long-standing tradition of releasing a list of the 10 most dangerous web application security vulnerabilities. This list is based on attacks observed on real-world systems as well as expert knowledge and it’s updated every few years. Since 2019 OWASP has also released a dedicated OWASP API Security Top 10 focusing solely on API-based vulnerabilities. The similarities between the two lists are striking. In Figure 1 they become especially clear when we map the traditional OWASP Top 10 items (right) to the API Security Top 10 (left).



Figure 1: Comparing similarities between the OWASP Top 10 and the OWASP API Security Top 10.

It’s clear that authentication and authorization are challenges for all kinds of applications.

API authentication and authorization best practices

There are a few authentication and authorization best practices to help you make sure your APIs are secure. Keep in mind that this is only an introduction. Be sure to see the deep dive into API authentication and authorization in our Essential API Security course.

Download the Essential API Security course

1. Use key management

Static configuration—associating a specific public key with a client—is the most straightforward configuration but it’s largely restricted to closed systems where clients are known upfront. Public keys can also be stored in a centralized key store where the API can retrieve them. Adding a new client just requires that you register a new public key with the centralized key store. This approach allows for more flexibility than static configurations since clients do not have to be explicitly known to the APIs.

Many systems use a public key infrastructure (PKI) to handle keys. In a PKI-based system a trusted central authority confirms the trustworthiness of a client key typically by issuing an X.509 certificate. The API trusts this authority so it also trusts certificates issued by this authority. The most well-known deployment of this system is the use of TLS/HTTPS on the internet.

2. Use transport layer security

Most of today’s internet traffic relies on transport layer security (TLS) to provide security guarantees. TLS ensures the confidentiality and integrity of the data being transferred. Additionally a typical TLS connection also provides authenticity assurances about the remote server that the client is connecting to. For example when you visit https://www.synopsys.com TLS helps your browser verify that the server responding is indeed a legitimate server hosting the Synopsys website.

An important component of TLS is that it supports two-way authenticity meaning that the client is also required to prove its identity to the server. This mode of operation is known as mutual TLS (mTLS). TLS fundamentally relies on public/private key pairs and X.509 certificates so it is well-suited to implement a key-based client authentication mechanism.

Since TLS is a network layer protocol applications typically do not implement any of the details in code. Instead they rely on existing libraries to set up a TLS connection. This pattern is one of the strengths of using mTLS for client authentication: There is little to nothing to implement in the application itself.

3. Use JSON web tokens

JSON web tokens (JWTs) are often used to implement key-based client authentication. The client generates a JWT and signs it with a private key. The API then validates the JWT with the client’s public key and uses the embedded claims to make an authorization decision. Due to the nature of JWTs there are quite a few degrees of freedom when implementing a client authentication scheme.

For example RFC 7523 describes how to use a JWT for authenticating a client to the authorization server. This scenario is slightly different from using JWTs to authenticate to an API but it nonetheless provides a good example of how JWTs handle authorization.

A signed JWT can only be used to call a specific endpoint within the validity window between the issued-at and expiration timestamps. The JWT is typically included in the request using a custom header.

When dealing with multiple clients it is also recommended to include a key identifier in the JWT’s header. This helps the API retrieve the correct key for this particular client from a key provider. After verifying the JWT signature the API should ensure that the claim corresponds to the identity used to retrieve the key.

Comparing JWTs and mTLS

So should you use mTLS or a custom JWT-based client authentication scheme?

Overall mTLS is well-supported and offers robust security properties. However because mTLS operates at the network layer it can be too rigid to guarantee the necessary security properties. For example server-side middleboxes such as reverse proxies API gateways and traffic inspection devices require access to the data of network requests so they have to terminate the TLS connection. This means the TLS connection is established between the client and the middlebox. After inspection the middlebox sets up a new connection with the API to forward the request information. However the presence of the middlebox erodes the security benefits of using mTLS.

A JWT-based authentication mechanism does not suffer from this inconvenience. When using JWTs the middlebox still handles TLS traffic but forwards the entire request to the API including the JWT provided by the client. When the JWT contains metadata about the request it guarantees the request’s integrity preventing the middlebox from tampering with the request information.

For these reasons mTLS is recommended for native clients that access server-side APIs that reside in a tightly controlled environment. When the limitations of mTLS impact the end-to-end security of your architecture the use of JWTs provides a viable alternative.

When to use OAuth 2.0

JWTs and mTLS both have their respective drawbacks. Keeping track of authentication state on the back end makes it harder to scale applications up. Making the back end stateless is beneficial to scalability but reduces control over authentication state harming revocability.

Additionally both approaches are designed for first-party scenarios in which the client and back end trust each other. Implementing such an architecture for third-party clients without sacrificing security can be a challenge and that’s where OAuth 2.0 comes in.

The goal of OAuth 2.0 is to enable clients to access resources such as APIs on behalf of a user. OAuth 2.0 is an extensive framework that enables authorization in complex architectures both for first-party and third-party scenarios.

In an OAuth 2.0 architecture the client interacts with the authorization server to obtain an access token. This token represents the client’s authority to access APIs on behalf of the user. The client includes this token on any request to the API allowing the API to make authorization decisions.

OAuth 2.0 supports two types of access tokens: reference tokens and self-contained tokens. When using reference tokens the API asks the authorization server to translate the identifier into the associated state which can be considered a stateful approach. When using self-contained tokens APIs can handle tokens independently which corresponds to a stateless approach. OAuth 2.0 also provides control mechanisms to reduce the lifetime of self-contained access tokens reducing the impact if they are stolen.

Making user-based authorization decisions in APIs requires having user authentication information. Users typically authenticate once after which their authentication state is propagated on every request. The specific mechanism to track authentication state is highly dependent on your application’s architecture.

Configuration is key

Authentication and authorization are core to the security of APIs. Because they play different roles it’s important to configure them correctly. But together they ensure that the correct and legitimate users have access to your webapps and that they have the correct and legitimate permissions to accomplish the tasks they need to perform.

Ambitious climate goal

The GB pilot programme is particularly timeous – with the country facing mounting havoc from soaring temperatures and a drought that is expected to last well into next year according to the Environment Agency – and supports Sysco’s ambitious climate goal to reduce emissions across entire value chain which includes 333 distribution facilities worldwide services around 700000 customer locations (posting $68bn in revenue for FY2022).

The company is aiming to reduce its Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 27.5% between 2019 and 2030 and recently added 2500 electric vehicles to its US fleet. It also is pushing its suppliers – which represent 67% of spend – to set their own science-based targets by 2026.

And while CEOs claim to be merely passing on increased costs an explosion of dividends and buybacks within Big Food companies suggests otherwise. As “Greedflation” keeps sweeping the nation consumers appear to have accepted their plight with little pushback beyond grumbled complaints. Such passivity — perhaps fueled by an acceptance of market factors as the sole cause — may be emboldening runaway price gouging. However buyers have little recourse when it comes to necessities like food.

Sysco is a prime example of how Big Food took advantage of rising supply costs as an opportunity to increase profits. The restaurant and commercial food distributor passed a 13.4 percent increase onto its clients and yet came out ahead to the tune of a 159 percent increase in annual earnings. Kevin Hourican the company’s CEO is quoted in Restaurant Business as describing how raising prices on customers while increasing profit was an “efficient pass-through of inflation”.

Likewise in a news release the company’s CFO Aaron Alt described how profitability had increased in spite of inflation — “strengthening our balance sheet and returning $1.5 billion to our shareholders.” To put that in perspective Sysco’s net capital expenditures for the year were less than half of that amount at just over $600 million. Of the $1.5 billion in shareholder giveaways $500 million went towards stock buybacks while the remainder was distributed as dividends. Furthermore Alt expects the 2023 fiscal year to bring an increase in earnings per share of 25 to 35 percent — all while no doubt continuing to pass on any cost increases.

At 12.2 percent food prices (as in food bought to prepare and consume at home) rose at a higher rate than the average increase across all items which was 9.1 percent over the course of the fiscal year ending in June 2022. But according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) “food away from home” prices (as in restaurants and food service) rose at a slower rate only 7.7 percent — suggesting that while there might not have been pushback when the largest food wholesaler in the country passed on double-digit increases restaurants and institutions were likely absorbing much of it in the form of losses. Long-term this trend could affect the landscape of the restaurant industry as chain restaurants are better equipped to withstand such pressures. Meanwhile many mom and pops that barely made it through the worst of the pandemic are struggling to keep their doors open.

Sticker shock at the checkout counter has many families feeling the same pressure. Kraft Heinz — the maker of numerous American kitchen staples such as Philadelphia cream cheese Oscar Meyer and Miracle Whip — has raised prices by 13.9 percent since 2019. The Kellogg Company has also been raising prices since the middle of 2020. Like Sysco both food conglomerates blame inflation for cost increases while watching their net revenue rise. Kraft Heinz saw its net income increase by over 1000 percent for the second quarter of 2022 while simultaneously paying out $980 million in dividends to shareholders in just the first half of the year. Likewise The Kellogg Company paid out $394 million in dividends and bought back $300 million worth of stock during those same six months.

The Wall Street Journal credited Kraft Heinz's CEO Miguel Patricio with explaining that the lack of consumer pushback is the result of how universal price hikes have been. Leadership from Starbucks and Chipotle were a bit bolder as they referred to their companies’ pricing power. Starbucks handed out $1.7 billion in dividends and bought back $4 billion in stocks over the first nine months of the 2022 fiscal year — last October its previous CEO announced it would spend $20 billion in stock buybacks and dividends over a three-year period though interim CEO Howard Schultz rolled back that commitment on his first day back at the company. Chipotle recently bought back over $260 million in shares after experiencing a double-digit increase in revenue in the second quarter. The fast-casual restaurant chain still plans to buy back an additional $300 million worth of stock — and customers can expect higher prices.

The insatiable appetite Big Food companies have for profits isn’t only threatening families and small businesses. Regarding runaway prices Morgan Stanley recently warned “In addition to taking a bite out of discretionary spending increasing food costs have pushed inflation higher and pose a serious risk to global economic recovery.” (Though the investment bank doesn’t appear to recognize the effect of increasing profit via “pass-through inflation” and instead only blames market factors.) There is good news however: Researchers with the firm are hopeful that food prices will begin to drop at the start of next year.

The pilot will include a range of temperature-controlled electric vehicles including two Electra 19-tonne HGVs and two electric vans.

Parent company Sysco said that the vehicles which arrived in July would be used to test different routes collect charging data and test the performance of the vehicles and batteries.

However the business admitted that cost and infrastructure were still significant barriers to converting the entire fleet.

“Our vehicles cover almost 60 million miles a year. Transforming our fleet to zero-emissions will be vital to achieving the company’s ambitious science-based climate targets and supporting our customers to achieve their own” said Sysco GB supply chain and operations director Mark Jenkins.

“We’re excited to be delivering to customers in zero-emission multi-temperature vehicles which can save around 69 tonnes of carbon per HGV each year. When you consider the impact of expanding that to our entire fleet the potential is huge.

The project would pair SpaceX's Starlink satellite technology with the second-largest wireless carrier in the United States T-Mobile US and its mid-band spectrum mobile network and large customer base.

Delivering space-to-ground Internet to mobile phones will require SpaceX to finalize development of its second generation of Starlink satellites. These will be significantly larger than the current ones which have a mass of about 295 kg. SpaceX founder and chief engineer Elon Musk said the project could enter ""beta service"" before the end of 2023.

During a live event at SpaceX's Starbase facility in South Texas where the company is building and testing its next-generation Starship rocket Musk appeared alongside T-Mobile US chief executive Mike Sievert. The event had something of a rocket concert flair with a smoke machine fireworks and plenty of people mingling around the stage in black T-shirts. Only these shirts bore magenta T-Mobile and white SpaceX logos and three Starship prototypes loomed in the background.

The companies are proposing to deliver a service dreamed about since the advent of mobile telephones—no dead zones. ""Our vision is if you have a clear view of the sky you're connected"" Sievert said.

How this would work

Presently a user of SpaceX's Starlink service needs to have a dish-shaped terminal that can pull down broadband Internet from one of the 2800 Starlink satellites in low Earth orbit. The existing satellites are just not powerful enough to connect to much smaller mobile phones as the signal is too weak.

The solution to this problem is using a much more powerful phased array antenna on the second version or V2 of the Starlink satellites. Musk said the body of these satellites would be about 7 meters long and the antenna would fold out to be about 5 meters on a side or ""roughly 25 square meters."" As the satellite passes overhead this antenna will send and receive data along a focused beam passing across the planet's surface.

Initially at least the service would not provide broadband Internet service. But in a typical cell of service it should provide up to 2 to 4 megabits of data enough for thousands of voice calls or millions of text messages. This would allow connectivity in areas off the grid or during emergency situations such as when a hurricane knocks out service to a community.

A user's cell phone would look for service first from a cell phone tower but when it did not detect this instead of providing a user with no bars of service the phone would search the sky. It would then draw connectivity from the nearest available satellite with software on the satellite communicating to the mobile phone as if it were a virtual cell tower on the ground.

Sievert said T-Mobile planned to offer this service to its users on most of its existing plans for free initially covering the United States including Alaska and Hawaii as well as much of the world's oceans. He invited foreign mobile network operators to partner with T-Mobile and SpaceX and offer reciprocal roaming around the world.

The challenges

Beyond regulatory issues SpaceX faces several major challenges to make this all work. Principal among them is designing and building the large satellites capable of talking to mobile phones.

""These are the most advanced antennas in the world we think"" Musk said. ""They have to pick up a very quiet signal from your cell phone. Just imagine that signal has to travel 500 miles and then be caught by a satellite that's traveling at 17000 mph. The satellite's got to compensate for the Doppler effect of moving so fast.""

The satellites also have to get into space. The V2 satellites are too large for the Falcon 9 rocket's payload fairing which is 5 meters across. So the full-size Starlink V2 satellites will need to wait for the much larger Starship rocket to come online. SpaceX is working toward doing just that at the Starbase facility in South Texas but operational launches are likely at least a year away.

To that end if Starship development does not come as soon as expected Musk said SpaceX may develop a ""V2 mini"" Starlink satellite that could fit within the Falcon 9 rocket's payload fairing. But it seems clear that bringing the kind of global connectivity Musk and Sievert spoke about will require a fully operational Starship launch system.

In his comments on Thursday night Musk acknowledged that the company has a lot of technical work to do but he said the SpaceX teams have made great progress.

""So it's really quite a difficult technical challenge"" he said. ""But we have it working in the lab and we're confident this will work in the field. So it's actually quite a lot of extra hardware on the satellites and it's also a lot of software. It's a hard problem.""

The competition

SpaceX has already launched satellites for one competitor in this area Lynk and is due to launch the ""BlueWalker 3"" demonstration satellite for another company AST Space Mobile later this year. Both of these companies are attempting to deliver direct-to-cellphone service.

Lynk says it has already successfully demonstrated the ability to use ordinary unmodified mobile telephones to connect to satellite Internet services. The company presently has one operational satellite in space but is planning to launch more to provide a wider area of coverage.

“Elon said it's hard and it’s only been done in the lab but Lynk has done it in space already"" Charles Miller the co-founder and chief executive of Lynk said in an interview Thursday night. ""We’re the only company in the world that has done that.""

Lynk has 14 commercial contracts with mobile network operators covering 35 countries Miller said. The company expects to receive a license from the US Federal Communications Commission before the end of this year to begin selling commercial service in those countries.

While Lynk has a head start and AST Space Mobile a satellite ready for demonstration tests the entrance of SpaceX and T-Mobile two of the world's leaders in spaceflight and connectivity has created a whole new level of competition. Plausibly they could pull this off as SpaceX has already deployed the worlds largest satellite constellation and the company has a history of delivering on its new rockets.

Musk and Sievert seemed to enjoy themselves on stage and talked of other ways the two companies might partner. Starlink for example might provide ""backhaul"" capacity to remote cell towers on Earth. This means the satellites would connect those towers to the Internet without T-Mobile having to run wire to the towers.

And perhaps one day T-Mobile might become the first cell service provider on Mars. “We’d love to have T-Mobile on Mars"" Musk quipped during the event.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlZWt3aXJlLmNvbS8yMDIyL3QtbW9iaWxlcy1jb3ZlcmFnZS13aWxsLWdldC1hLWJpZy1ib29zdC1mcm9tLXNwYWNleHMtc3Rhcmxpbmstc2F0ZWxsaXRlcy1zdGFydGluZy13aXRoLXRleHRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,T-Mobile's coverage will get a big boost from SpaceX's Starlink satellites starting with texts,"Starship prototypes serve as a backdrop for T-Mobile’s Mike Sievert and SpaceX’s Elon Musk.

T-Mobile subscribers will be getting a satellite upgrade to their wireless service thanks to a newly announced partnership that takes advantage of SpaceX’s Starlink constellation.

But don’t expect to start streaming high-definition videos via satellite to your T-Mobile connected devices immediately: The beta version of Starlink’s broadband boost won’t start rolling out in select areas until next year after a series of SpaceX satellite launches.

That rollout will begin with text messaging including SMS MMS and messaging apps. Voice and data coverage will come later.

T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk laid out the details behind the deal today during a live presentation at SpaceX’s Starbase facility in South Texas.

Sievert said the partnership calls for creating a new network composed of Starlink satellites that can use T-Mobile’s mid-band spectrum nationwide. He said the vast majority of smartphones already on its network would be compatible with the new satellite-plus-cellular service.

“You can connect with your existing phone” Sievert promised. He said he expected to include the Starlink-enabled service free with T-Mobile’s most popular plans. With less popular plans a monthly fee might be charged he said.

The hybrid service is designed to be available practically anywhere in the continental U.S. and Hawaii plus parts of Alaska Puerto Rico U.S. territorial waters and vast stretches of the world’s oceans. That means T-Mobile’s customers could get a signal in traditionally inaccessible locales including national parks and wilderness areas.

Sievert called it “the end of mobile dead zones.”

Musk played up the idea that people who get into trouble in isolated areas would be able to get in contact with the outside world even if no cell towers were available. “It will save lives” he told the crowd.

SpaceX is already the world’s leader in providing satellite broadband service from low Earth orbit. Over the past three years it has launched more than 3000 of its Starlink satellites which are manufactured at SpaceX’s facility in Redmond Wash. About 2300 of those satellites are currently in operation according to satellite-watcher Jonathan McDowell’s Starlink Statistics webpage.

Musk said the new generation of satellites would have to be equipped with large “extremely advanced” antennas. “It’s a hard problem that why it’s not been solved before” he said.

The next-generation satellites will be designed for launch on SpaceX’s giant Starship rocket which is currently under development. If that development effort runs into snags SpaceX may come up with an interim solution that would allow the satellites to be launched on the workhorse Falcon 9 rocket Musk said.

Starlink is said to have more than 400000 subscribers worldwide while Bellevue Wash.-based T-Mobile US reports having 110 million customers. The newly announced team-up could boost T-Mobile in its competition with the likes of Verizon and AT&T for cellular customers and strengthen SpaceX’s hand as Starlink goes up against OneWeb and Amazon’s yet-to-be-launched Project Kuiper satellite broadband network.

Financial details behind the partnership were not immediately announced.

Looking ahead Sievert didn’t rule out the idea that T-Mobile could have Starlink handle backhaul transport for its data. “Well we’re open to that and we’re partners now” he said.

Although T-Mobile and SpaceX made clear that the new service would be phased in gradually starting next year they laid out a grand vision for what T-Mobile called “Coverage Above and Beyond.” Sievert invited telecom network providers around the world to collaborate on global connectivity with T-Mobile committing itself to offering reciprocal roaming to those providers who accept the invitation.

Musk went even further when he was asked how the partnership with T-Mobile meshed with his plans for solar system exploration and settlement.

“We’d love to have T-Mobile on Mars” Musk said sparking cheers from the crowd.

Update for 6:45 p.m. PT Aug. 25: In a tweet Musk emphasized that the T-Mobile-Starlink system as currently envisioned may not be capable of say streaming that high-definition movie:

SpaceX and T-Mobile want to beam cell service to “most places in the US” including some of the most remote areas of the country that traditionally have not been touched by wireless connectivity.

The idea which the companies plan to roll out in beta testing by the end next year is to use SpaceX’s satellite-based internet business Starlink to provide an “extra layer” of connectivity to T-Mobile phones. T-Mobile is also offering reciprocal roaming to cellular carriers in other countries as well in the hopes that Starlink’s global reach will enable people to use their phones for messaging around the planet.

“This is an open invitation to carriers around the world please get in touch with us” SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said during an event announcing the plan.

The new service will rely primarily on “version 2” or V2 Starlink satellites according to Musk. Those are not expected to begin launching before next year.

“To provide this service the companies will create a new network broadcast from Starlink’s satellites using T-Mobile’s midband spectrum nationwide. This true satellite-to-cellular service will provide nearly complete coverage almost anywhere a customer can see the sky” according to a T-Mobile press release.

Satellite-based cellular service through Starlink will also work with phones on the market today Musk said.

Essentially the goal is to bring about the “end of mobile dead zones” T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert said during an event announcing the partnership at SpaceX’s facilities in South Texas. But it will only be available to people on T-Mobile plans though Sievert said the “most popular plans at T-Mobile” will get the service at no additional charge. The companies said that at first service will likely be limited to text-based messages with video and voice calls occasionally getting through. The companies plan to upgrade the service later.

“You might just have to wait half an hour maybe for the thing to go through but it should still work from early on” Musk added. “It’s not a substitute for ground cell stations because ground cell stations especially in urban and suburban areas will definitely be superior to what we’re talking about here. This is really meant to provide basic coverage to areas that are currently completely dead.”

T-Mobile says it estimates that “well over half a million square miles” of the US are “untouched by cell signals” according to a press release.

Musk billed it as a mission to “save lives” as it could provide people with connectivity in emergency situations such as when hiking in remote areas.

It’s well known that large swaths of the United States don’t have internet access or cell service. While cell service relies on towers that beam connectivity across certain areas and traditional broadband connections require webs of underground cables SpaceX’s Starlink has taken a different approach to connectivity. Its services relies on hives of satellites just a few hundred miles above Earth that work in tandem to beam connectivity.

It remains to be seen how effective the partnership will be and how many wireless customers will benefit. Starlink is also still a new service with only about half a million users so far.

The news comes just two weeks after federal regulators announced that SpaceX would not receive the nearly $900 million in subsidies that the company was awarded in December citing the fact that its satellite-based service is “still developing technology” and the company “failed to demonstrate that [it] could deliver the promised service.”

The Federal Communications Commission which oversaw the subsidy program said there were several reasons it decided to deny SpaceX’s subsidies including that recent data that “indicate that Starlink’s speeds have been declining from the last quarter of 2021 to the second quarter of 2022.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMjUvc3BhY2V4LWFuZC10LW1vYmlsZS10ZWFtLXVwLXRvLXVzZS1zdGFybGluay1zYXRlbGxpdGVzLmh0bWzSAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMi8wOC8yNS9zcGFjZXgtYW5kLXQtbW9iaWxlLXRlYW0tdXAtdG8tdXNlLXN0YXJsaW5rLXNhdGVsbGl0ZXMuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SpaceX and T-Mobile team up to use Starlink satellites to 'end mobile dead zones',"SpaceX founder Elon Musk and T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert on stage during a T-Mobile and SpaceX joint event in Boca Chica Beach Texas on Aug. 25 2022.

SpaceX founder Elon Musk and T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert said that their companies are working to ""end mobile dead zones"" and will launch a new mobile service enabled by Starlink second-generation satellites and T-Mobile bandwidth.

Starlink is comprised of a network of satellites that SpaceX has launched into low Earth orbit and designed to deliver high-speed internet in remote locations across the globe. SpaceX has launched more than 2700 satellites to support this network.

Speaking at SpaceX facility in Boca Chica Texas on Thursday night Sievert said T-Mobile will be dedicating a ""slice of its mid-band PCS spectrum"" to be integrated into Starlink satellites launched next year.

T-Mobile users will be able to use messaging MMS and certain messaging apps from remote points across the lower 48 states Alaska Puerto Rico and Hawaii and even some remote points in the water.

Eventually the service will work with voice Sievert said. T-Mobile plans to include the service in its most popular mobile plans but did not disclose specific pricing.

Musk said the service will work with Starlink's second generation satellites which have very large antennae and will be able to transmit directly to a cell or mobile phone.

The service won't require mobile users to get a new phone. Musk said in or after a natural disaster even if all the cell towers are taken out the planned service should work.

Musk specified ""This won't have the kind of bandwidth a Starlink terminal will have but this will enable texting it will enable images and if there aren't too many people in the cell zone you can even potentially have a little bit of video."" He added ""We will no longer read about these tragedies that happened where people got lost an if only they could have called for help they'd be ok.""

T-Mobile will also offer ""reciprocal roaming"" so that visitors to the US from outside the country can use the service if they also partner with SpaceX to enable this service globally. Musk and Sievert invited carriers overseas to join their alliance.

Shares of T-Mobile closed up by a point on Thursday at $147.07 and were trending slightly higher after hours.

As CNBC Pro previously reported Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note on the sector this week that they favored T-Mobile as a top pick within telecom services and they ""expect T-Mobile to continue to take share driving superior top- and bottom-line growth with the buyback likely to commence soon.""

TROW,T Rowe Price,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBsYW5zcG9uc29yLmNvbS9pbi1kZXB0aC9jb25zaWRlcmluZy1tdWx0aXBsZS1xZGlhcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Considering Multiple QDIAs | PLANSPONSOR,"While target-date funds solved many problems for both plan sponsors and plan participants there is also increasingly widespread recognition that one size doesn’t quite fit all. As participants get older and closer to retirement their financial lives often become more complicated requiring more customized solutions than a target-date fund can provide.

In response some plan sponsors are considering creating multiple qualified default investment alternatives including managed accounts in order to serve the needs of multiple cohorts of employees.

“We have been talking a lot to advisers about these ‘dynamic QDIAs’” says Michael Doshier senior retirement strategist at T. Rowe Price Intermediaries. Typically the scenario discussed involves the automatic enrollment of young participants into a target-date fund and then some trigger—such as age account balance or some combination of similar factors or life events—causes participants to get automatically re-enrolled into a managed account solution.

“There’s a uniform belief now in the industry that the single blunt-force instrument of automation is perfectly fine for a 25-year-old but doing the same things for a 65-year-old could be dangerous” he says.

Under the Pension Protection Act plans have three options for QDIAs: target-date funds managed accounts and balanced accounts. While target-date funds do have a glide path based on a participant’s age managed accounts can take other factors into account including assets outside of the plan preferred retirement dates and their tolerance for risk.

While target-date funds remain the primary choice for most plan sponsors managed account funds have evolved in recent years with new technology bringing down the costs associated with them. But for now when plan sponsors use managed accounts as their QDIA most default all participants into them rather than starting them in a dynamic QDIA also known as a “hybrid QDIA.”

A Demand for Personalization

“Sponsors recognize that people want personalization and that the managed account programs have come a long way in terms of the data points and the personalization and customization has increased” says Nathan Voris director investment insights and consultant services at Schwab Retirement Plan Services in Richfield Ohio. “So you are seeing more adoption there. More advisers are also leveraging managed accounts as a tool in their toolkit or building a collective investment trust that they can use in a managed account.”

Empower Retirement was the first recordkeeper to introduce dynamic QDIAs in 2016 and other recordkeepers including Fidelity Charles Schwab and Principal have followed suit.

“Advisers are taking a much more active role and that is driving adoption of these QDIAs” Voris says. “We are seeing more and more plan sponsors and more and more advisers ask questions about our capabilities in this space and exploring it as an option.”

Voris says that multiple QDIAs are one of the top three discussion topics he engages on with advisers and interest has increased significantly over the past three years. That said adoption from plan sponsors remains low he adds.

“That’s usually the last part to come” he says.

An Opportunity for Engagement

Voris says dynamic QDIAs create an opportunity to engage with participants when they’re transitioning from a target-date fund to managed accounts. Such engagement can inspire an individual to start thinking about retirement Voris says.

That in turn can lead to interest in having a financial plan and provide an opportunity for the plan adviser to provide counseling and guidance. The ultimate outcome can be a participant who is more prepared to make the transition from accumulating assets for retirement to decumulating them in retirement he adds.

For plan sponsors thinking about going that route Voris says they should make sure that the methodology of their target-date funds is in sync with that of the managed accounts. If the target-date funds are passively managed for example the managed accounts should be as well.

In another twist on customizing QDIAs Doshier says that he has also been speaking to some advisers who are starting to advocate for auto-enrolling some worker cohorts into a Roth 401(k) rather than a traditional 401(k).

“Many people who are at low incomes or tax brackets today will likely be at higher tax brackets tomorrow” Doshier says as incomes typically go up over time. So those individuals might be better off paying their taxes upfront now while their tax rate is lower.

Risks to Consider

Some experts think having multiple QDIAs in a plan could prove too risky for plan sponsors.

“I believe that target-date funds will become more customized by plan sponsors over time but right now there’s a lot of risk involved with that” says John Hume vice president at Segal Marco Advisors. “You’re seeing different lawsuits all around.”

Plan committees considering implementing such a structure should carefully document their decision process Hume adds.

“In this litigious environment we are in right now it’s all about the process” Hume says. “You would have to follow a process that’s reasonable with an investment consultant and a plan design consultant and a communications consultant. They would have to all come together and come up with a strategy that’s based on your plan population.”

That documentation should include not only the reasoning behind using a QDIA but also the thought process behind the decumulation strategy if the managed accounts include one Voris says.

Given that managed accounts often require more engagement from participants than target-date funds (so that the manager can customize allocation) one solution might be to require participants to complete an education component before moving them from a target-date fund to a managed account option Hume says.

Dynamic QDIAs are preferable to an approach that uses two completely separate QDIAs within the plan because the latter route could cause confusion among participants says Katie Hockenmaier U.S. defined contribution research director at Mercer.

“It could also foster dissatisfaction if a participant receives targeted communications that one set of funds is intended for them while they actually believe they belong to a different cohort with a different set of funds intended for use” she says.

In addition having multiple QDIAs could stimulate misuse.

“A sponsor can’t restrict participants from using certain funds while permitting other participants to defer into those funds” Hockenmaier explains. “If two or more QDIAs are offered it is possible that participants intended to use one QDIA may opt into another one that is not deemed as appropriate.”

Still Hockenmaier says with careful planning and communication a dynamic QDIA could work and she has seen a small number of plan sponsors implement them successfully. Another solution involves two different plans with different QDIAs. That option is popular among plan sponsors with a cohort of employees who have a legacy defined benefit plan along with their defined contribution assets.

“Sometimes two DC plans are created where those with a DB benefit fall under one DC plan as they will have a specific plan and investment design given that they have known outside company assets that may impact their savings behaviors and those without a DB benefit fall into a separate DC plan” Hockenmaier says. “Given the plans are technically separate and participants have varied needs two different QDIAs could be offered one for each plan.”

In that case the separation between the two plans makes it easier for participants to understand and use the two different QDIAs she adds.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9hcm15LXRlc2xhLWZhbnMtc291dGgta29yZWEtMTEwMzAwMzQ2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,An army of Tesla fans in South Korea holds a collective stake of more than $15 billion in Elon Musk's company putting ...,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

South Korean retail investors together own more than $15 billion in Tesla stock Bloomberg reported.

It's a bigger stake than that held by billionaire investor Larry Ellison per Bloomberg.

One South Korean family told Bloomberg they ploughed their entire $230000 savings into Tesla.

Retail investors in South Korea hold a combined stake of more than $15 billion in Elon Musk's Tesla according to Bloomberg.

Many have gone all-in on the electric carmaker with one family ploughing their entire $230000 life savings into Tesla stock Bloomberg said.

The stake held collectively by South Korean retail investors is equivalent to 1.6% of the company — more than the holdings of billionaire investor Larry Ellison or investment group T. Rowe Price Bloomberg calculated citing August 17 data.

Some of Tesla's South Korean fans describe themselves as ""Teslams"" a portmanteau of ""Tesla"" and ""Islam"" and an apparent show of faith in the company.

Many bought Tesla stock during the pandemic during which the combined holdings of South Korean retail investors grew more than a hundredfold per Bloomberg.

Park Sunghyun told Bloomberg she and her husband injected their $230000 savings into Tesla stock after being priced out of buying a new home around 2019. ""With this man I thought we could go all-in"" Park mother to a seven-year-old son said.

Tesla stock closed at $889.36 Tuesday meaning it's down 15.8% year-to-date. It's been beaten down amid a broad pullback in the tech sector on the back of interest rate hikes and recession fears. The stock also got knocked in June after Musk announced he's thinking about job cuts at Tesla.

Earlier this month Musk sold Tesla shares worth nearly $7 billion to raise cash in case he's ultimately forced to buy Twitter. It means Musk owns about 155 million shares in the company according to Bloomberg data.

Screenwriter Michael Green (Logan Blade Runner 2049 Death on the Nile) will pen the screenplay that brings the popular video game franchise to the big screen. Netflix is partnering with 2K and Take-Two Interactive to produce BioShock the film. Variety was the first to report Lawrence and Green’s involvement.

Developed by Irrational Games and published by 2K a subsidiary of Take-Two Interactive Software the BioShock game franchise includes BioShock BioShock 2 and BioShock Infinite.

Released in 2007 BioShock is a first-person shooter set in a crumbling underwater city named Rapture its society fragmented in a civil war with many inhabitants addicted to a genetic enhancement serum that gives them superhuman powers while also living in fear of Big Daddies mutated humans who have been grafted into diving suits. Into this world is dropped the game’s protagonist Jack a survivor of a mysterious plane crash in the Atlantic Ocean.

Netflix is banking on a global audience with the BioShock franchise having sold more than 39 million copies worldwide. The next installment is currently in development by Cloud Chamber.

Producers on the Netflix movie adaptation include Roy Lee for Vertigo Entertainment and Lawrence for about:blank while Cameron MacConomy and Strauss Zelnick will executive produce.

Video game adaptations have done very well for Netflix none better perhaps than The Witcher (the video game series is itself an adaptation of the Witcher novels by Andrzej Sapkowski). A fantasy series fronted by Henry Cavill it’s one of the top-rated titles on the streaming platform and has a spinoff and an anime movie in the works.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN5ZnkuY29tL3N5Znktd2lyZS9uZXRmbGl4cy1iaW9zaG9jay1maWxtLWFkYXB0YXRpb24tc25hZ3MtaHVuZ2VyLWdhbWVzLWRpcmVjdG9y0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3lmeS5jb20vc3lmeS13aXJlL25ldGZsaXhzLWJpb3Nob2NrLWZpbG0tYWRhcHRhdGlvbi1zbmFncy1odW5nZXItZ2FtZXMtZGlyZWN0b3I_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Netflix’s ‘BioShock’ feature adaptation snags ‘Logan’ screenwriter and ‘Hunger Games’ director,"It looks like Netflix is moving ahead on bringing the city of Rapture to a television screen near you.

It’s been six months since we found out that Netflix was partnering with 2K and Take-Two Interactive to adapt the popular video game franchise BioShock into a live-action feature. Things have been fairly quiet since then until today when news broke that the project officially has a writer and director on board.

According to Variety the filmmaker behind The Hunger Games films Francis Lawrence has signed on to direct while screenwriter Michael Green (Logan Blade Runner 2049) is on board to pen the script.

The BioShock franchise includes three first-person shooter games — BioShock BioShock 2 and BioShock Infinite. The first two games take place in the crumbling underwater city of Rapture. The story starts out in 1960 where the city — an Ayn Rand-inspired place initially built to be a utopia free from religion or government intervention — has become a dystopian nightmare. Among its decaying streets are those who have gone insane from a genetically-altering chemical called ADAM as well as hulking characters known as Big Daddies who protect creepy little girls called Little Sisters. The player finds themselves in the first-person perspective of a guy named Jack a man who finds himself in Rapture after his plane crashes. The third game takes place in a floating city called Columbia that’s really really into the “American way” of life.

This isn't the first attempt to adapt the games. Back in 2008 Universal Pictures was working on a film adaptation that after two directors and several battles over budget eventually fizzled out. The BioShock games have sold more than 39 million copies worldwide however so it's not surprising that Netflix wanted to make its own attempt at an adaptation.

There's no news yet on who will be cast in the streaming platform’s BioShock however much less when it will premiere.

Michael Green whose credits include “Logan” “Blade Runner 2049” and “Death on the Nile” will pen the screenplay.

Netflix will produce the live-action film with the game’s publishers 2K and Take-Two Interactive. Comprised of “BioShock” “BioShock 2” and “BioShock Infinite” the franchise is situated within a number of different dystopian landscapes. According to the official description “BioShock” “blends sci-fi and horror to pose unique existential and societal questions that reshaped how game stories could be told – all amidst pulse-pounding action gameplay that rewards sharp shooting clever planning and lethal improvisation.”

Along with 2K a subsidiary of Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. Roy Lee will produce for Vertigo Entertainment while Francis Lawrence will produce for about:blank. Executive producers are Cameron MacConomy for about:blank and Strauss Zelnick for Take-Two Interactive.

Developed by Irrational Games the “BioShock” franchise launched in 2007 and has since sold more than 39 million copies worldwide. Cloud Chamber Studios is currently developing the next installment.

An adaptation of “BioShock” first went into development in 2008 at Universal Pictures with “Pirates of the Caribbean” filmmaker Gore Verbinski directing but he left the project a year later and the film was scrapped altogether over budget concerns given the intended R-rating.

Between directing “I Am Legend” episodes of Apple TV+’s “See” and three of the “Hunger Games” films Lawrence has plenty of experience with the dystopian genre. He reteamed with “See” star Jason Momoa for “Slumberland” which will premiere on Netflix in November. He also directed Jennifer Lawrence in the R-rated spy thriller “Red Sparrow.”

Green’s recent projects include “Death on the Nile” “Jungle Cruise” and series “American Gods.” He’s slated to co-write screenplays for “Carry On” starring Taron Egerton and Jane Wu’s star-studded series “Blue Eye Samurai.”

Sources tell Deadline that Netflix has tapped Hunger Games director Francis Lawrence to helm the pic with Michael Green adapting the script.

The directing and writing assignment had been among the more sough-after jobs in the industry after Netflix said in February it was partnering with video game holding company Take-Two Interactive and its game publisher subsidiary 2K to produce a BioShock film. Since then the studio and its partners have been aiming high on who would help guide this project given the scope of the property looking at A-list directors and writers for the job.

The studio has been high on Lawrence since the spring as he is someone who has shown the ability at adapting popular IP into global hits. One example is what he did for the Hunger Games franchise after Gary Ross left the series after directing the first film. That franchise became a smash; Lawrence has since returned to direct the prequel Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes which is in production now and will premiere in 2023.

Since Lawrence is currently filming that the plan is for Green to adapt the BioShock script and once Lawrence has wrapped he can jump into pre-production.

Set across multiple dystopian and visionary landscapes gone wrong the BioShock video game series blends sci-fi and horror to pose unique existential and societal questions reshaping how game stories are told—all amidst pulse-pounding action gameplay that rewards sharp shooting clever planning and lethal improvisation. The award-winning franchise first introduced by 2K in 2007 has sold more than 39 million copies worldwide across the original releases of titles including BioShock BioShock 2 and BioShock Infinite as well as multiple rereleases remastered editions and bundled collections.

Roy Lee will produce the movie through his Vertigo Entertainment along with Lawrence for about:blank and 2K. Executive producers are Cameron MacConomy for about:blank and Strauss Zelnick for Take-Two.

Management consultancy Gallup found that Gen-Z and younger millennials today place support for a diverse and inclusive workplace as a top priority in what they look for in an employer.

Tapestry a large global fashion company based in New York consisting of Coach Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman has committed to creating a work environment that is more diverse equitable and inclusive. To spearhead this work the organisation recruited David Casey as its first chief inclusion and social impact officer earlier this year who was set an immediate task to expand diversity within leadership teams and actively reduce gaps in inclusion by gender and race/ethnicity.

Focusing on platforming its existing talent through career progression and development the company has also developed a global people manager development programme already filling 80 percent of its leadership roles internally in 2021.

Due to such endeavours Tapestry was featured on Forbes’ “Best Employers for Diversity” list for the fifth consecutive year as well as on the “Best Employers for Women” list in 2022. It also scored 100 on the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index for the eighth consecutive year and was named the “Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality.”

Now BoF sits down with Tapestry’s chief inclusion and social impact officer David Casey to discuss how Tapestry is executing its social impact efforts its priorities moving forward and the challenges and opportunities the company faces in working towards its 2025 goals.

What does it mean to belong at Tapestry?

We believe that being true to yourself is core to who we are as a company. There are three parts to this: first your voice is valued here; second your ambitions are supported; and third your work is recognised. We do believe that difference sparks brilliance so we actively welcome people and ideas from everywhere to join us to stretch what is possible.

At Tapestry we refer to diversity and inclusion as EI&D because we lead with equity. We aim to understand and appreciate that each of our brands has a unique voice and clients but under the Tapestry umbrella we all serve a common opportunity and purpose to have a positive impact on society.

What are your priorities as Tapestry’s new chief inclusion and social impact officer?

First and foremost I am continuing to learn. The EI&D function has always been a priority for us but became a formalised function two years ago so as we think about the near term it’s about how we operationalise this work. As a result we have four key pillars that we are focusing on.

Our first pillar is talent making sure that we are getting more than our fair share of the diverse talent in the marketplace and ensuring equitable opportunities for growth and progress for people once they join the organisation. The second is culture. When people join our organisation we want to create a positive experience here but we understand that is going to be unique for every single one of our employees.

The third pillar is community and how we make sure that we are not just in communities but we are a part of that community fabric. Fourth is marketplace and how we create and ensure that we have an inclusive experience for every person who engages us either through a physical facility or digitally.

Our near-term priority is moving from awareness of those pillars to having them show up in every single part of how we run the business.

How have Tapestry and its brands implemented equity inclusion and diversity priorities so far?

From a talent perspective it is diversifying where we go to source talent and opening ourselves up to think differently about the types of career experiences and educational experiences that individuals may have to have or need to have in order to join the organisation.

It is not just enough to have representation — we want to understand and impact the lived experiences of our associates.

From a culture perspective we have a number of employee resource groups such as the Black Alliance Working Parents and Caregivers Prouder Together which represents the LGBTQIA+ community and Asian Heritage Alliance resource groups. We hope this gives all of our employees an opportunity to feel a part of our broader organisation ensuring they find those communities within the company to feel a sense of connection and have a more intimate cohort.

As you think about the community pillar we have also done a lot across the Tapestry and brand foundations to step up and ensure that we are giving back to the communities in which we operate. In some cases such as the Kate Spade New York Social Impact Council it is focused on mental health and wellbeing. In other cases such as the Coach Dream It Real programmes it is focused on educational opportunities to help drive equity.

What are Tapestry’s main goals and challenges within its EI&D strategy?

One thing that we set out to do was to build diversity in North American Tapestry and brand leadership by increasing racial and ethnic representation in leadership positions to better reflect the general corporate population.

The second goal we had was to reduce differences in the Employee Inclusion Index based on gender and race/ethnicity and to demonstrate our focus on career progression development and mobility by filling 60 percent of our leadership roles at VP level and above internally.

One on-going challenge is the increasing rapidly changing demographics of the workforce. We are learning in real-time along with every other company as we think about diversifying our talent base understanding what the needs of underrepresented demographics in the workplace going forward are what our new reality will be. We have made significant improvements but we have more work to do. There’s no point in time where we are going to be done with EI&D.

What efforts is Tapestry making to tackle gender and racial inequality in the workplace?

We are looking to cultivate a culture of inclusion through our Inclusion Index where we survey our employees at several points throughout the year and ask them to give us feedback that is part of our EI&D scorecard as well as making progress on closing any gaps that we may see across demographics. It is not just enough to have representation — we want to understand and impact the lived experiences of our associates.

It is difficult to drive sustainable accountability across organisations [...]. One way to do that is to attach accountability to compensation.

It is difficult to drive sustainable accountability across organisations but we are holding true to our focus and commitment. One way to do that is to attach accountability to compensation. We announced in FY22 that we were going to tie 10 percent of our leadership team’s annual incentive compensation to making progress in EI&D. That progress is measured through an annual scorecard with both qualitative and quantitative metrics.

How does Tapestry’s EI&D work extend to external partnerships?

We want to make sure that we are helping to drive equality and equity through the educational experience of young people — BIPOC individuals in particular. We are supporting the Fashion Institute of Technology’s Social Justice Centre as one of three founding partners to commit $1 million to support their work bringing a more diverse group into the higher-education pipeline and to enhance opportunities for professional growth within our industry.

What excites you about the future of EI&D within Tapestry?

What excites me about our four-pillar framework is that it touches every single part of how we do business. There’s a role for every single one of our employees to play — from our stores to the C-Suite. You don’t have to be a part of the EI&D team you don’t have to be a part of HR you don’t have to be a member of our executive committee — you can lead from where you are.

We can do good for the stakeholders who rely on us and depend on us and we can help the company do well simultaneously. That’s what excites me about this holistic approach to the work that Tapestry has underway and that we’ll be building upon going forward.

As it reported fiscal year-end earnings Aug. 18 parent company Tapestry Inc. reported a big increase in North American customers particularly for its Coach brand.

The New York-based company handles all North American distribution for Coach products from its facility at Jacksonville International Tradeport near Jacksonville International Airport.

“We acquired 15 million new customers in North America alone over the last 24 months including approximately 7.7 million new customers in fiscal ‘22” said CEO Joanne Crevoiserat in Tapestry’s conference call with analysts.

“Importantly we have seen these new customers transact at higher AURs and they have returned to the brands with higher frequency” she said. Average unit retail (AUR) is the average selling price for an item.

“At the same time we have increased retention rates and continued to reactivate lapsed customers across brands all of which has led to more active customers engaging with our brands at higher average spend” Crevoiserat said.

Coach is by far Tapestry’s biggest business but it also owns the Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman brands.

Analysts said Tapestry’s results show higher income consumers still are willing to spend in the current economy but they also credited Tapestry’s performance.

“Years of work to drive engagement with North American consumers are clearly working” Credit Suisse analyst Michael Binetti said in a research note.

“In the context of what we are seeing across retail more broadly we think Tapestry’s execution and FY23 guidance stands out as better than peers” Morgan Stanley analyst Kimberly Greenberger said in a note.

Tapestry reported sales rose 16% in the fiscal year ended July 2 to $6.68 billion with adjusted earnings rising by 59 cents a share to $3.47.

Coach brand sales rose an adjusted 18% to $4.92 billion and Crevoiserat said the sales were 15% higher than pre-pandemic fiscal 2019 sales with the brand gaining 4 million new North American customers.

“Our success over this past fiscal year highlighted by a significant acceleration in sales at strong margins underscores our confidence in the brand and its meaningful opportunity for long-term sustainable growth” she said.

According to Tapestry’s annual report the company’s 1.05 million-square-foot Coach distribution center in Jacksonville is by far its biggest facility.

Tapestry also has fulfillment centers in Japan and China and a Kate Spade distribution center in Ohio.

Tapestry is forecasting more modest growth in fiscal 2023 with revenue projected at about $6.9 billion and earnings of $3.80 to $3.90 per share.

“While we see some risks with the F2023 outlook which assumes North America can stay resilient in a broader consumer slowdown the company is playing from a position of strength and management has proven it can be nimble.” Baird analyst Mark R. Altschwager said in a research note.

Home Depot Pro sales increase

The Home Depot Inc. reported higher second-quarter sales with strong demand from its core do-it-yourself homeowner customer.

However its professional contractor division which grew from a Jacksonville business Home Depot acquired is outpacing the do-it-yourself business.

The Atlanta-based chain of home improvement stores created the contractor division called Home Depot Pro in 2018 after its acquired Jacksonville-based Interline Brands in 2015.

Interline marketed products for maintenance repair and operations professionals.

Home Depot reported total sales for the second quarter ended July 31 rose 6.5% to $43.8 billion and sales at stores open for more than one year rose 5.8%.

The company does not break out sales data for the contractor business. But in its Aug. 16 conference call Executive Vice President of Merchandising Jeff Kinnaird said sales growth was higher in the Pro division.

Ted Decker

“We’re encouraged by the continued momentum we are seeing with our Pros and they tell us their backlogs remain healthy” Kinnaird said according to a transcript of the call posted by the company.

“During the quarter we saw robust project demand across the business. This can be seen in the double-digit comp performance of our building materials plumbing and millwork departments as well as in certain project related categories like fencing siding conduit boxes and fittings tubs and showers and countertops” he said.

While the company won’t give specific numbers on how big its Pro business is CEO Ted Decker reiterated previous projections by the company that they see a potential $450 billion annual market for that segment.

“We just see tremendous opportunity. And I would say yes that is a category that we are outperforming and happy for it” Decker said in the conference call.

Home Depot reported earnings of $5.05 a share up from $4.53 in the second quarter of 2021.

Black Knight sets Sept. 21 shareholder vote

Black Knight Inc. scheduled a special meeting for Sept. 21 for shareholders to vote on its proposed buyout by Intercontinental Exchange Inc.

ICE agreed to buy each share of the Jacksonville-based mortgage technology May 4 for a price equal to $68 plus 0.144 times ICE’s market price.

At the time of the agreement that made the value of the deal $85.04 per Black Knight share.

Black Knight’s Aug. 19 proxy statement for the special meeting put the price at $83.09 a share based on ICE’s recent stock price. That’s well above Black Knight’s closing price of $67.26 on Aug. 19.

Even if the deal is approved at the September meeting the merger is not expected to be completed until the first half of 2023 because of an extensive antitrust review by the U.S. Justice Department.

ICE is best known for its operation of the New York Stock Exchange but it also has a large mortgage technology business and analysts have said regulators are concerned about the company gaining too much of the U.S. mortgage technology market in the merger.

Black Knight’s proxy said the shareholders meeting will be held virtually by remote communication.

Fidelity expands title business

Fidelity National Financial Inc. announced Aug. 16 it acquired AllFirst Title Insurance Agency which expands Fidelity’s title business in Texas Oklahoma New Mexico and Arkansas.

Jacksonville-based Fidelity is the largest U.S. title insurance company and has a history of expanding with acquisitions of smaller regional companies.

Fidelity did not announce financial terms of the AllFirst deal.

Tulsa-based AllFirst will continue to operate and serve its customers through its various brand names.

GEE Group benefits from staffing demand

GEE Group Inc. reported higher revenue for its third quarter ended June 30 as the post-coronavirus recovery increases demand for its staffing services.

Revenue in the quarter rose 8% to $41.1 million and the company reported adjusted earnings of $3.1 million or 3 cents a share reversing a loss last year.

Jacksonville-based GEE Group said growth in its direct hire business was higher than its contract staffing services.

It said shortages of workers for highly skilled positions and the trend to more remote workers which creates security concerns is driving demand for direct hires.

This was GEE Group’s fourth straight quarterly profit since it reduced debt last year.

“Having consistently achieved profitable growth and higher margins earnings and free cash flow for the last four quarters we now have a positive track record as well as positive momentum for the future” CEO Derek Dewan said in an Aug. 16 conference call according to a company transcript.

Duos reports ‘order of magnitude’ improvement

The pandemic slowed down growth plans for Jacksonville-based Duos Technologies Group Inc. which provides technology solutions for railroads and other industries but business is improving this year.

The company reported second-quarter revenue of $3.62 million up from $649000 a year earlier.

Chuck Ferry

“Our financial performance in Q2 represented an order of magnitude improvement over our results in recent reporting periods” CEO Chuck Ferry said in an Aug. 15 conference call according to a company transcript.

“I am pleased to report that our Q2 results are the third quarter in a row where we have met or exceeded our internal financial metrics” he said.

“Additionally Q2 represents the highest single quarter recurring revenues in the company’s history. We will continue to emphasize growing that portion of the revenue at a greater rate going into next year.”

Duos projects total 2022 revenue of $16.5 million to $18 million about double its 2021 revenue.

However economic conditions could impact the projections.

“While supply chain issues have started to show some signs of improvement time between contract award and full revenue recognition remains longer than was the norm in prior years” Chief Financial Officer Adrian Goldfarb said in the conference call.

“At this time we still expect to see higher revenues later this fiscal year and into 2023” he said.

Duos had a net loss of $1.34 million in the second quarter.

SG Blocks means ‘safe and green’

As SG Blocks Inc. reported its second quarter results CEO Paul Galvin explained the meaning of the company’s name.

“The ‘S’ and the ‘G’ in our name stands for safe and green” Galvin said in an Aug. 15 conference call.

SG Blocks is a modular building company that converts shipping containers for structures.

The company moved its headquarters to Jacksonville this year.

SG Blocks says taking those large containers that otherwise would go to waste is good for the environment and it hopes profitable for the company.

Revenue jumped from $8.8 million in 2020 to $38.5 million last year but business has been slower this year.

Second-quarter revenue of $7.6 million was lower than the $11.9 million in revenue in the 2021 second quarter.

Welcome to the Salesforce Fiscal 2023 second quarter results conference call. [Operator instructions]. I would like to hand over the conference to your speaker Mike Spencer executive vice president of investor relations. Sir you may begin.

Mike Spencer -- Executive Vice President Investor Relations

After all the newsletter they have run for over a decade Motley Fool Stock Advisor has tripled the market.* They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Salesforce Inc. wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of August 17 2022

And with that let me hand the call to Marc.

Marc Benioff -- Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

Well hey thanks Mike. And thank you everyone for being on the call today. As you saw in the results for the quarter we've delivered really strong revenue growth profitability and cash flow showing yet again the resilience and durability of our business model in this economic environment. Revenue in the quarter was $7.7 billion up 22% year over year or 26% growth in constant currency.

We had a great quarter but yet again the dollar had an even stronger quarter and we continue to see the impact on foreign exchange and currency fluctuation on our financials. For Q2 we saw approximately $250 million of headwind to revenue which is roughly $50 million more than we assumed in our guide last quarter and we now expect a total of $800 million foreign exchange headwind year over year for the full fiscal year. Operating margin in the quarter was 19.9% and we delivered $334 million in operating cash flow. Our remaining performance obligation or the total undelivered contract value that we have with our customers is really an incredible $41.6 billion and this is revenue signed.

It's not yet recognized. Now turning to guidance. Over the last few months I've met with hundreds of CEOs with economists business leaders political leaders and other experts about their business and where they see this global economy heading. And I don't think it's going to surprise anyone; everyone has got a slightly different answer.

And it doesn't matter who you speak to could be a different geography a different position everybody sees things at a slightly different way right now. But what we do know and what I think everyone will agree on is that digital transformation remains the No. 1 priority for CEOs and that every digital transformation begins and ends with the customer. That's what continues to drive our business forward and it's why Salesforce is the No.

1 CRM by market share globally according to the IDC Software Tracker. Now for those of you who have been on these calls with us we've all been through a number of these economic cycles. And we've especially seen that over our last 23 years. And once like this come around we see customers becoming more measured in the way they buy.

Sales cycles can get stretched. Deals are inspected by higher levels of management and all of this we began to start to see in July. Nearly everyone I've talked to is taking a more measured approach to their business. We expect these trends to continue in the near term and we reflected this in our guidance.

Given the significant impact of foreign exchange and buyers being more measured we're revising our fiscal '23 revenue guidance to $30.9 billion to $31 billion or about 17% growth year over year or 20% in constant currency. At the same time we're maintaining our fiscal year '23 operating margin guide of 20.4% an expansion of 170 basis points year over year. This is further evidence that we remain deeply committed to consistent disciplined margin cash flow and revenue growth as part of our long-term plan to drive both top and bottom line performance. We have the right team the right products the right playbook for getting to $50 billion in revenue in fiscal year '26.

We always get questions about our M&A strategy and what company we're going to acquire next and what we're going to do next from an acquisition cycle. I think we get this question every single earnings call that we do like this. And it's always one of my favorite parts of the call. And I'm excited to tell you we have found a great cloud company growing revenue for 73 consecutive quarters through every economic cycle.

It's got great cash flow No. 1 market share an incredible brand one of the most admired companies in the world great values fantastic community of 17 million Trailblazers fantastic commitment to its community runs across 90 countries. And that company is Salesforce. We're thrilled that our Board of Directors has authorized up to $10 billion in our first-ever share repurchase.

This reflects the confidence we have in our business and in our approach to generating shareholder value. Brian Millham is going to expand in more detail about the broader capital allocation strategy in a moment. And you'll also hear about some amazing customer wins in the quarter. I'm especially proud of a major deal we closed in the quarter with the U.S.

Department of Veterans Affairs and it's one of our most meaningful partnerships. The VA is a relationship that we've been building for over 6 years and now Salesforce is becoming the digital front door for our veterans and their families. We can't be more proud to do our part in helping those who have made sacrifices in serving the nation. It's been an incredible year so far being able to connect with our customers in person again has been just amazing.

We've done 63 marketing events so far this year hosting over 250000 Trailblazers and counting. But none is more exciting on every level than Dreamforce. And we're hoping to see all of you as we celebrate our 20th Dreamforce September 20th through the 22nd right here in San Francisco. It's a celebration of our Trailblazers and we're going to expect 150000 people to be here and registered to attend.

And we'll also be streaming the entire 3 days on Salesforce+ and expect millions more to tune in. We have an amazing line of product announcements and innovations and speakers and giving back. It's going to be a big Dreamforce. It's going to be really the biggest Dreamforce ever our 20th ever Dreamforce.

And we're also going to be celebrating the impact Salesforce has had through our one-one-one philanthropic model as we've now surpassed over $0.5 billion in grants 7 million hours of volunteerism and more than 50000 nonprofits using Salesforce for free. At Dreamforce the amazing Red Hot Chili Peppers that's Anthony and his entire band playing to everyone. They're going to be performing at our annual benefit concert with 100% of the proceeds going to our children's hospitals right here in San Francisco and in Oakland. So please tell your friends tell your firms tell your vendors tell everybody to get sponsorships to Dreamfest because it's going to be incredible.

And of course you're all invited to our investor day during Dreamforce on September 21. Amy are they invested even if they don't do the Dreamfest sponsorship?

Amy Weaver -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah Marc they are invited.

Marc Benioff -- Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

All right. Look you're not going to want to miss it. Look before handing off to Bret I'd like to congratulate Brian Millham our new Chief Operating Officer. Brian is employee No.

13 and has been helping us to build this company from its earlier days. As chief operating officer Brian is going to continue to lead our customer success organization and now adds global sales to his responsibilities. Bringing our incredible customer success ecosystem Sales Cloud sales even closer under Brian will help us to deliver the full power of Salesforce to every one of our customers in the new economy. And we're so fortunate that Gavin Patterson has taken on this important new role as Chief Strategy Officer helping us to guide our strategic direction.

And thank you and congratulations to Gavin. I'm so grateful to Gavin who for the last two years during the pandemic has overseen one of Salesforce's most rapid growth periods in Salesforce's history. When I look back at the last three years I saw it was really only two years ago in fiscal year '21 when we did proud I think it was about $5.1 million -- is that -- $5.1 billion. Is that right Mike something like that? And then last year I think for Q2 we did something like $6.3 billion and now we're doing $7.7 billion if I get the numbers right.

I mean it's an incredible trajectory of growth from over the last 24 months. And I couldn't be more proud of Gavin to help us during that period and now Brian in your COO role. Congratulations to Brian and Gavin. And with that I'm going to turn it over to Bret.

Bret Taylor -- Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

Thanks Marc. And congratulations Brian and Gavin. As Marc said we had another strong quarter delivering strong top and bottom line performance. Our results demonstrate the durability of our business model and the strength of our strategy.

Our Customer 360 product portfolio is the industry standard and the market leader a leader in 12 current Gartner Magic Quadrant reports. And the platform is helping hundreds of thousands of companies in every industry digitally transform. Our technology is also deeply differentiated. Einstein Artificial Intelligence platform is now doing over 175 billion predictions every day.

Just incredible. Our go-to-market capability is also unmatched in the industry. The diversity of the industries regions and lines of business we serve has driven the durability and resilience Marc talked about and you've seen in our business over the past 23 years. And finally our ecosystem is unparalleled in enterprise software.

As 150000 Trailblazers joined us for Dreamforce next month they represent a global community of developers administrators and ISVs 17 million strong that are driving what IDC estimates to be $1.6 trillion in new business revenues by 2026. As you heard from Marc we're in a more measured buying environment. Executive teams are scrutinizing all purchasing decisions and we are seeing some deals take longer to close. I personally met with over 100 CEOs this quarter in my travels across Latin America Europe and North America and digital transformation remains their top priority.

But the focus of the conversation has shifted meaningfully toward productivity efficiency and time to value. In this environment our Customer 360 portfolio is uniquely positioned to enable our customers to deliver both growth and cost savings. And you can see it in this quarter's results. Sales Cloud revenue grew 15% year over year a healthy 19% in constant currency including customer wins at CDW Zscaler and Schneider Electric.

Using our Sales Cloud and CRM analytics Schneider reduced their close time by 30%. And with MuleSoft they saved 40000 hours of employees' time and saved $2.7 million in IT costs. Service Cloud grew 14% year over year or 18% in constant currency including customer wins at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Workday and Uber.

Our digital service product line in particular accelerated as customers pivoted their spend to digital technologies that reduce customer service costs. Uber Eats is a great example. Uber Eats saw a 20% improvement in productivity across email chat and phone support channels with our service cloud and more importantly with their investment in our Einstein AI chat bots they improved their call deflection by 30%. Our marketing and commerce cloud grew together 17% year over year or 22% in constant currency including significant expansion of our relationships with Live Nation L'Oreal and Tapestry.

In our commerce cloud we are seeing GMV growth decelerate in line with the rest of the e-commerce industry as consumers settle back down to pre-pandemic norms. Platform including Slack grew 53% or 56% in constant currency including great Slack expansions at organizations like the National Weather Service Coursera and Mercado Libre. The National Weather Service selected Slack as its platform to connect over 4300 employees with emergency managers public safety decision-makers and local media partners nationwide. I'm also excited to say that we will have over 12 Slack product integrations with our Customer 360 platform live and generally available by Dreamforce where we have an incredible opportunity to help every one of our customers build their digital HQ and Slack in this new era of flexible work.

Data which includes MuleSoft and Tableau grew 12% year over year or 13% in constant currency with wins at brands like Atlassian Siemens Energy CBRE Group and King Power which is Thailand's leading travel retailer. I'm heartened by the progress we're seeing in our go-to-market transformation of MuleSoft. We are on track to have MuleSoft return to be in a tailwind for revenue growth in the back half of the year. And finally our 12 industry clouds were another bright spot in the quarter growing faster than our line of business cloud as our customers are increasingly focused on time to value and reducing their implementation costs.

The out-of-the-box industry processes we've built into our industry clouds are a compelling value proposition in this more measured buying environment and I'm excited about the new processes we brought to market in the first half of the year including trade promotion management for consumer goods and our virtual assistant for our Financial Services Cloud. As we head toward Dreamforce our pace of organic innovation has never been stronger. In our summer release alone we delivered key innovation like revenue intelligence for predictive forecasting the ability to talk to your data through Tableau MuleSoft Robotic Process Automation and a new lakehouse architecture for our customer data platform. And just this week we launched Salesforce Easy a new all-in-one self-service suite for sales marketing service and commerce that is going to transform how small businesses engage with Salesforce.

As you'll hear more from Amy we're committed to durable growth at scale. We're committed to our 20.4% operating margin this year and I'm excited that we're announcing our first-ever $10 billion share repurchase program today. Our capital allocation strategy is simple. We will continue to expand our free cash flow margin as we scale.

We will invest in our organic innovation. We will reduce the impact of dilution both by offsetting stock-based compensation and by maintaining a healthy balance sheet to fund any future M&A. I'm so grateful to our 17 million Trailblazers all of our partners and most importantly our employees for helping provide our customers with the innovation agility and resilience they need to navigate these uncertain times. Now over to Amy to discuss the financial details of the quarter.

Amy Weaver -- Chief Financial Officer

Great. Thank you Bret and congratulations Brian. I'm pleased to report strong top and bottom line financial results for Q2. That is pleased to report strong top and bottom line financial results in Q2.

As you've heard from Marc and Bret our diversified portfolio remains well positioned to help our customers both grow and drive efficiencies in their business. Our customers are relying on us more than ever to be their trusted advisor partnering with them on their digital road map. Now let me walk through our results for Q2 of fiscal '23 beginning with top line commentary. Total revenue for the second quarter was $7.72 billion up 22% year over year or 26% in constant currency.

FX continued to represent a headwind as the dollar continued to strengthen throughout the quarter. In Q2 the headwind from FX was about $50 million more than we had guided. A few highlights from the quarter. Sales Cloud continues to be a critical piece of our customers' success helping companies drive more productive growth.

In Q2 sales cloud grew 15% year over year and 19% in constant currency. Service cloud grew 14% year over year and 18% in constant currency as we help our customers realize efficiencies and cost savings. As customers focus on their digital strategy and transformation we continue to see growing multi-cloud adoption due to the number of customers who have purchased 5 or more clouds again grew in double digits. And Slack continued to outperform our revenue expectations with revenue of $381 million.

Slack continues to gain traction with customers. And in Q2 seven of our top 10 deals included Slack. And for the fifth consecutive quarter the number of customers spending greater than $100000 with Slack grew by more than 40% year over year. Now for a quick update on data.

I'm pleased to say that data passed $1 billion of revenue this quarter. And with that all of our 5 clouds are now generating more than $1 billion in revenue a quarter. Data growth of 12% or 13% in constant currency was driven by MuleSoft total revenue growth of 15% and Tableau growth of 9%. As a reminder approximately half of MuleSoft and Tableau's total contract value is recognized in period resulting in more quarterly volatility than our other core products.

Turning to revenue attrition. Rates remain at record lows ending Q2 at approximately 7.5%. Q2 non-GAAP operating margin was 19.9% driven by our continued focus on disciplined decision-making and prioritization. Q2 GAAP EPS was $0.07 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.19.

Mark-to-market accounting of the company's strategic investments benefited GAAP EPS by $0.03 and non-GAAP EPS by $0.04. Operating cash flow was $334 million in Q2 down 13% year over year. Capex was $203 million resulting in free cash flow of $131 million down 24% year over year. Now before getting to our RPO performance and guidance I'd like to address the current economic environment.

As both Marc and Bret mentioned we started to see more measured buying behavior from our customers which began in the last month of the quarter. This resulted in stretched sales cycles additional deal approval layers and deal compression. In addition we saw slowing in our create and close Slack self-serve and SMB businesses which tend to be leading macro indicators. Geographically this behavior was most pronounced in North America and major European markets while Japan was relatively more resilient.

From an industry perspective retail consumer goods and communications and media were the most impacted while high tech energy and financial services stayed more consistent during the quarter. And from a product perspective commerce and marketing saw more pronounced decelerations while sales and service remains strong. Turning to remaining performance obligation or RPO which represents all future revenue under contract. It ended Q2 at approximately $41.6 billion up 15% year over year.

Current remaining performance obligation or CRPO was approximately $21.5 billion up 15% year over year and 19% in constant currency. This includes 1 point of incremental FX headwind beyond our Q2 guidance. Moving to Q3 guidance. We expect revenue of $7.82 billion to $7.83 billion or approximately 14% growth year over year and 18% in constant currency.

This reflects a $250 million FX headwind. We also expect the $380 million contribution from Slack. As a reminder Q3 represents the fifth quarter of Slack contributions to revenue. Therefore the year-over-year growth rates will be normalized.

CRPO growth is expected to be approximately 12% year over year or 15% in constant currency. And we expect GAAP EPS of $0.09 to $0.10 and non-GAAP EPS of $1.20 to $1.21. Now turning to our full year fiscal '23 guidance. We are now guiding to fiscal '23 revenue of $30.9 billion to $31.0 billion or approximately 17% growth year over year 20% in constant currency.

This incorporates the trends in customer behavior that we saw beginning in July. The total year-over-year FX headwind is now $800 million an incremental $200 million year over year since our previous guidance. As a reminder the currencies most impacting our revenue are the euro the British pound the Japanese yen and to a lesser extent the Australian dollar. Our guidance continues to assume a $1.5 billion contribution from Slack.

As a company we remain committed to profitability over the long term. And while we see a more deliberate customer buying behavior I am pleased to hold our fiscal '23 non-GAAP operating margin guidance at 20.4% an increase of 170 basis points year over year. This margin guidance includes roughly 100 basis points of headwind from Slack. As a reminder because our regional revenue and expenses are generally in the same currencies there tends to be a natural FX hedge in our operating margin.

For the full year we expect GAAP EPS of $0.38 to $0.40 and non-GAAP EPS of $4.71 to $4.73. And please recall that our OIE and EPS guidance assumes no further mark-to-market adjustments of our strategic investment portfolio. We are updating our fiscal '23 operating cash flow guidance to approximately 16% to 17% growth year over year. Our guidance continues to assume a three-point headwind from cash taxes associated with tax law changes requiring the capitalization of certain R&D costs.

We expect capex to be slightly above 2% of revenue in fiscal '23 a nominal increase over last quarter's guide reflecting the revised full year revenue guidance. This results in free cash flow growth of approximately 18% to 19% for the fiscal year. So to close as our customers and their executive teams including the CEO CIO and CFO focus on their digital investment strategy we are well positioned with our diversified product portfolio to help drive efficiencies and growth. And we are laser-focused on disciplined decision-making with a commitment to achieving our operating margin guidance.

Lastly let me echo Bret and Marc. We are very very pleased to be announcing our new share repurchase program today. This step is a reflection of the confidence that we have in the future of Salesforce. And I look forward to seeing everyone at investor day on September 21 where we will go into even more detail on our capital allocation strategy.

Now Emma let's open up the call for questions.

Questions & Answers:

Operator

[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.

Keith Weiss -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. I think what's really on top of everybody's mind right now is the takedown in the full year revenue guide and what's causing that. You talked a lot about the macro side of the equation and we definitely see that all around us.

We definitely see that in our checks as well. But I think what people want to understand is there anything more to this? Is there anything more execution-related perhaps the go-to-market? And is the change in sales leadership from Gavin to Brian is this in any way meant to address any shortcoming on the distribution strategy? So that's part one. Part two on the expense side equation. Very impressive to be able to sustain 20.4% operating margin target even with the revenues coming down.

I guess for Amy is there another level of what kind of expense reductions or sort of another gear that you had to sort of go in to be able to sustain that operating margin expansion? And does that impact your ability to sort of invest in the business to sustain those operating margins?

Marc Benioff -- Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. I'm so happy to talk to you Keith and I'll tell you that you're right. We took the guide down really around two points. One is the foreign exchange environment is obviously just unprecedented.

And we talked about that last quarter as well. I think maybe we were one of the first to really see what was going on. Somehow just being on the ground in some of these countries that have been so dramatically hit. But to look at where we are right now with the yen to look where we are right now with the euro I think the euro maybe just broke parity yesterday.

I mean we're really in an unprecedented moment in foreign exchange. And on the other side as I said and I think as the team has really emphasized really starting in July we started to see some metrics where we're like where do we exactly want to be for the year? And what is appropriate for us? And how do we correctly characterize where the business is? And that is really how we kind of put together this guide which we think is the appropriate way to communicate the status of the business because we want to be in a place where we're communicating exactly where we are. So I'm sure Amy is going to amplify that as well.

Amy Weaver -- Chief Financial Officer

Sure Marc. I think you nailed it on that. When we look at the guide I believe the guide is appropriate under the circumstances we're seeing right now. And as you know that there's two key drivers.

The first part is FX the key currencies the euro the pound the yen they've all weakened to near historic levels and we're seeing that impact on our top line as we look forward to the rest of the year. For the remaining part as we called out there was a distinct shift in customer buying behavior that we saw near the end of the quarter. And for purposes of the guide we're assuming that those conditions endured through about the half of the year. Now turning to your second part of your question which I think was on op margin.

As you know I was very happy that we are committed to 20.4% and holding that despite bringing down the top line. This is largely coming from a more disciplined approach. It is not a result of one single change. We are continuing to unlock incremental efficiencies across the business.

We're asking each leader to step up and look at their businesses and prioritize. I do believe that we are continuing to invest into growth which still remains our No. 1 priority. In terms of the specific drivers definitely continuing to take a measured approach and a very deliberate approach on hiring.

T&E we are prioritizing for customer-facing travel. And again we are continuing to benefit from some of the decisions we've made over the last few years on real estate.

Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is open.

Brent Thill -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Good afternoon. Marc I'm curious if you could talk about Brian's new role. And I think there's a lot of concern as new head of the sales comes in that there's some transition period. And can you just address this transition period? And I know he's been with the company for over 20 years and highly regarded but there's a lot of investors that would love to hear your perspective on this.

Marc Benioff -- Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

Well that would be my pleasure. I mean I think a lot of you know Brian he's been a trusted part of our management team for over 20 years. And look the last time he was the head of sales was only two years ago when we went into the pandemic and went through the transition with Keith. You may remember I put Brian in for I think one or two quarters to run global sales did a fantastic job.

He didn't want to continue with it. So we asked Gavin to step up from his role of -- I think it was International Chairman or European Chairman I can't remember honestly. And really proud of Gavin for the last now two years. And then Brian is right here.

And I asked Brian if he would come in and take this forward and he agreed. And I couldn't be more grateful to that. I know we have just a trusted hand. In terms of the transition period I couldn't imagine anybody who will operate the organization so seamlessly and transparently and with ease.

And everybody has such a good relationship already with Brian. And he already runs our forecast calls. He's already been a key part of our sales program. I don't expect any transition period at all and I'm holding him to that actually.

Bret Taylor -- Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

The other thing I just want to add is Brian has been running our customer success professional services and partnership organization for a long time. And I think the story to the pandemic has been our historically low attrition rates and our focus on customer outcomes. And I'm really excited about the opportunity of bringing our global sales organization together with our customer success organization. And it's a really important part of our philosophy.

And I think this move --

Marc Benioff -- Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

Well we definitely surprised both of us right how low attrition Brian has been able to get. And how great a job he's done.

Bret Taylor -- Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

And deeply connecting that success motion to our sales motion I think reflects a philosophical view from Marc and me about really our philosophy.

Marc Benioff -- Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

Brian can you just step out of the room while we finish answering this? Do you want to just comment on this?

Brian Millham -- President and Chief Operating Officer

Yeah. First of all I'm humbled by the opportunity and Marc to your comments. I've been very close to this business for the past two and a half years working side-by-side with Gavin. I actually was operating in a COO role for him running this business.

And I think it's critical as we look at sort of the second half of this year and beyond this motion of customer success and sales together will drive the outcomes that we're looking for and our customers are looking for. And so I'm thrilled with the results we've seen on the attrition side thrilled with the results that the customers are getting from the investment they're making in our technology and just so excited to lead the sales.

Marc Benioff -- Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

Can you just address Brent's direct question on transition time how hard of a transition is this going to be for --

Brian Millham -- President and Chief Operating Officer

I think it was measured in hours actually Marc. I've been running forecast calls already. I'm in the business travel industry customers. I met with four customers yesterday there will be no transition time.

There are no big changes that we're going to be making in our go-to-market other than getting closer to our customers and ensuring that we're delivering value to them in every single transaction that we're working on with them. So very excited to take this on with zero transition time.

Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open.

Raimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- Analyst

Thank you. Obviously the slowdown that we're seeing or the lengthening of sales cycles there's nothing that is kind of unique to you guys. We heard from other vendors as well. Can you talk a little bit about what you see in terms of client prioritization in terms of certain projects? Because I do remember from the old times that the front offers always had higher priority because it's revenue generating etc.

Are you seeing that now happening as well? And can you speak to that?

Bret Taylor -- Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. Thanks for the question. First I'll tell you I think that trend continues. Digital transformation remains our customers' top priority and digital transformation starts and ends with the customer.

And fundamentally all of our customers are really investing into the secular trend of the digitization of their customer experience their employee experience and with our portfolio we're at the top of that list. I think what you're seeing is an increased focus on I say three things. One is time to value. The other is ensuring that these projects drive cost savings in addition to customer satisfaction and top line growth.

And then the third is reducing complexity and vendor consolidation. Some of the stories I mentioned like Uber Eats I think are great examples because it's really about how do you put up things like digital service technology whether it's chatbots or self-service to really take out cost and make these projects pay for themselves as opposed to having protracted multiyear implementations. I think vendor consolidation is also a trend that we're seeing. And if you look at some of the innovation we're bringing out like our Sales Cloud Unlimited edition or Salesforce Easy which I mentioned earlier in my script they are really efforts to enable our customers to do more with less to enable them to use Salesforce as their sole vendor take out some point solutions that perhaps aren't getting the return on investments our customers are looking for and sort of taking advantage of this opportunity to be the most strategic vendor for our customers right now as they look to really hold their technology to high standards which is to drive top line and bottom line performance.

Brian is there anything you want to add?

Brian Millham -- President and Chief Operating Officer

Great question Raimo. And I agree with you that front office is the priority you heard both Marc and Bret and I'm feeling to when we're out talking to CEOs digital transformation remains our No. 1 priority and we need to make sure that we're delivering for them. We're also seeing it in the demand environment.

We are still seeing very good generation of pipeline in our business right now. And while we are facing some longer sales cycles and additional layers of deal approvals and potentially some deal compression the demand environment is solid. And so you're spot on that we are seeing the front office as a priority for every CEO out there.

Your next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Your line is open.

Brad Sills -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Great. Thanks for taking my question. Thanks for all the color on where you saw the macro impact. It sounds like SMB marketing commerce but the core sales and service looks to have held in nicely you didn't call out enterprise.

So any specific color on how the core business and the large enterprise those bigger expansion deals in the core track this quarter?

Bret Taylor -- Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

I'll start and then Brian I'd love your commentary as well. As you said I think the story actually the past number of quarters have been the strength of our core CRM business. Sales Cloud growing at 19% in constant currency is remarkable. This is the product that Marc and Parker built 23 years ago doing -- so much revenue growing at 19% is incredible.

And you're seeing it just in I think the continued strength in our core business. And the other thing I want to call out is our attrition rate being at historical lows as well. And I think it really reflects the strength of our business. And so as Amy articulated as it relates to SMB GMV deceleration we're seeing things settle down to pre-pandemic norms.

But I still see incredible strength in our core CRM business in the enterprise. And as I said I think the durability of our business really rests on the durability and diversity of our portfolio the diversity of the industries that we serve and the diversity of the segments that we serve. Brian is there any color you want to add?

Brian Millham -- President and Chief Operating Officer

Yeah. Well said. On the sales and service cloud are sort of the centerpiece of our digital transformation for our customers. And you saw the growth in the quarter and we expect that to continue.

We are seeing some compression in some of the larger transactions in our enterprise business and it's not a surprise. I've lived through three of these cycles before and you can see that maybe people take a more measured approach to their digital transformation maybe starting with a smaller piece but a land-and-expand strategy is something we've used for many many years we can grow as the strategy we've used. And so despite the fact that maybe some of these engagements are a bit smaller we do see acceleration in these customers in quarters to come. So yes there was compression out there in some of the business but we are very confident that we can go execute against the opportunity in front of us in these large enterprise accounts going forward with digital transformation being a top priority.

Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.

Kash Rangan -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Thank you very much. Lots of exciting news for Salesforce. Congrats on all the changes. My question maybe Brian congrats to you as well in your new position.

What would you do to turn around the data cloud? I know clearly it has had some very significant momentum. But I can in some sense look at the new guidance versus the old and say a lot of that delta is basically the slowdown on the growth rate in the data cloud that is the Tableau and MuleSoft business. Brian want to get your opinion on that. And just the management team as you talk to customers Marc you've been through these cycles before what are customers saying as to when they might reengage at the same level of enthusiasm at Salesforce be deal size or close rate.

What are the things that they're looking for from a macro perspective or leading indicators in their business so it could be back to reengaging the way they used to reengage with Salesforce.

Brian Millham -- President and Chief Operating Officer

First of all Kash thanks for the question and I appreciate the kind comments. On the data business it's a unique business for us because some of it is license based. And you can tend to see some of the headwinds we saw in July show up more immediately there. We feel very good about where both those businesses are right now particularly in MuleSoft that as you heard Bret say is on a great trajectory and will be a tailwind to our revenue growth in the second half of this year.

We feel great about that. Tab is a critical component of our digital transformation with every customer wanting to leverage data to have better insights to the way they operate their business. So clearly a lot of focus on these businesses because it is such a critical component of every digital transformation. We feel great about that both those integration and analytics as a category for accelerated growth in the second half.

So no big concerns there at all. I would say on your second question we are not economists and so we're not going to guide on where -- when people are going to feel like they're coming out of this. We think we're being appropriate with our guide for the second half of the year based on what we saw transpire in July. Marc and Bret?

Marc Benioff -- Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

Well I think the main piece that I would really focus on is really going to be spending as much time as I can with customers at Dreamforce. This is our opportunity to really understand deeply across a wide spectrum of our customers geographies verticals what it is that they are seeing in their own businesses. But I think when you look at these customers we mentioned one is L'Oreal this has just been an incredible success story for us. We see the B2C story.

They're using Marketing Cloud and Commerce Cloud and Service Cloud. The Commerce Cloud story is incredible where they have almost 200 sites globally now for all of their brands. They've got highly customized experiences on the web and mobile and in-store for -- I'm sure a lot of you use the Kiehl's brand. It's a great product.

They have a whole new skin hub. They've been with us. They've really reimagine their business using Customer 360. It's a company that we're going to feature and focus and talk about and inspire others at Dreamforce.

I think when you see stories like that when you look at all the stories that we've seen especially during this pandemic surge over the last 2 years it's incredible what folks have done with their businesses. When we get to this moment I don't think it's a huge surprise that customers are more measured. Everybody is like wondering exactly where the economy is going and how things are moving forward. So this is a point where people are taking a little bit of a breath and then they will reassess.

And then when they get their confidence and kind of a full vision for the next stage of their company they come in. And until then it's a lot of the transactional business that we would normally see and move forward with.

Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Your line is now open.

Karl Keirstead -- UBS -- Analyst

Thank you. Maybe I'll direct this to Marc and Amy and it's about the $10 billion share repurchase. So maybe a two-parter. Marc maybe for you why do you think this is the right time in the company's development to move forward with your first large repurchase? And then secondly should everybody on the line interpret this as a signal that perhaps large M&A may be off the table for now?

Marc Benioff -- Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

Well it's a great question. And I'll tell you this was kind of I looked at this quarter very much as kind of a milestone. I'm a big fan of SAP and I have a lot of respect for their business and what they've done in the market over the last 40 -- almost 50 years. And to see our business in July do more than they reported in June in terms of revenue that was very meaningful to me and I'm very grateful and proud of our team for kind of hitting this tremendous level of scale.

But at that same moment I kind of also can say OK what are some changes that we can make. And one of the things we have such massive cash flow that I think it's completely appropriate for us to look at how we're handling our dilution for example. I think that's been on the table for a while and a lot of my conversations with investors they bring it up. We've waited for that moment.

I think now is the right moment where we can say we're going to directly address this with our kind of first-ever share repurchase $10 billion. I'm very excited about it. At the same time I don't think that that takes M&A off the table. I think that we continue to look for opportunities.

We want to be able to use our cash constructively. This is important for us. It doesn't mean that we're not going to have different kind of guardrails for M&A. And Bret do you want to just address that point?

Bret Taylor -- Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. I think Marc you articulated it well. I mean when I mentioned this before but the pillars of our capital allocation strategy are No. 1 that we're going to continue to become more profitable to generate expanded free cash flow over time.

That's what Marc was saying.

Marc Benioff -- Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. Thank you for saying that.

Bret Taylor -- Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

You created a great business model in Software-as-a-Service Marc and I think --

Marc Benioff -- Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

No. I think that committing to this -- committing to the margin for the year is so critical as well for investors.

Bret Taylor -- Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

It is. And No. 2 we're going to invest in organic innovation. And we talked a bit on -- there's a question Amy earlier on investment.

I'm so proud of our investment in organic innovation. You'll see a lot more of it at Dreamforce but I think we have a better pace of organic innovation that we've had in our history. But -- and then finally we want to reduce the impact of dilution which is feedback I've gotten from all of you. And we're focused on offsetting our stock-based compensation.

And we're also focused on maintaining a healthy balance sheet because we understand that's an incredible piece of leverage we have for future M&A. So I think this is a way to -- that we can continue to acquire in the future. It's been a big part of our company's history. It will be a big part of our future but do so in a way that minimizes the impact of dilution and does it in a more shareholder-friendly way.

Marc Benioff -- Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

And you can see like we've picked up some great companies whether it was ExactTarget which was kind of the beginning of really augmenting Customer 360 with our Marketing Cloud and then moving on to MuleSoft was amazing. It's really provided all the integration and the connectivity and then on to Tableau and giving this extension of analytics. So important to so many of our largest customers. And then Slack I just mentioned L'Oreal it's an incredible Slack story.

They've streamlined their communication. They've got -- they have that awesome Brandstorm event. Have you seen that Bret? It's that worldwide innovation competition that they do. They've got more than 83000 student participants 65 countries.

They use Slack to drive that thing forward. You look at that we're a different company because we had an acquisition strategy over the last decade. I don't think we necessarily need to break that. But at the same time we need to be paying attention to dilution and the overall making sure we have the correct capital allocation strategy as well.

Amy Weaver -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah Marc I think that's really it. When we look at this I think this is very much a natural evolution of our capital allocation strategy. And what it really comes down to is that we believe Salesforce is positioned for success over the long term. And this announcement reflects the confidence that we have in our business that as we look forward and our approach to generating shareholder value.

Marc Benioff -- Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. And I really think that when we get to Dreamforce and you see how we brought all of these platforms together integrated them you're going to see some really powerful integration capabilities. You already saw some of it at the World Tour in New York with kind of the first level of the customer data platform. You're going to see a whole another extension of that kind of capability when we get to Dreamforce.

And it's -- I think as Bret said it's in a very exciting moment in time when it comes to innovation with the company.

Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Your line is open.

Kirk Materne -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst

Yeah. Thanks very much. I think this one is sort of for Bret. Bret I was just wondering if you could go into the industry cloud strategy a little bit and what you're seeing going on there.

And can you just talk a little bit about how important that strategy is as budgets come under more stress and the ability for you all to go deeper with your customers on an industry basis? I was just kind of curious if you can give us an update on that and then how that strategy maybe plays out in a more choppy macro backdrop.

Bret Taylor -- Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. Thanks Kirk. We have 12 industry clouds spanning a wide range of industries where I think CRM is particularly strategic from financial services to healthcare to consumer goods and manufacturing. And you can think of our industry cloud is essentially taking the Customer 360: sales service marketing e-commerce Tableau MuleSoft Slack and building industry-specific processes and workflows that work out of the box.

And as you're sort of alluding to there's a lot of value for our customers. No. 1 is they don't need to pay us or a professional services firm to implement the table stakes for their digital transformation. It works out of the box.

That means they can focus their investment resources in the areas of their business that are differentiated. It means they get faster time to value. And it means that these processes are stickier which is why our industry clouds have lower attrition rates than our line of business clouds. It's been a huge area of growth for us and actually a lot of credit to our chief product officer David Schmaier who actually -- his company which we acquired a couple of years ago.

Velocity was actually independent software vendor that built industry solutions on top of our platform and has been a strong advocate for this strategy internally. It's a huge part of our go-forward strategy. If you have an option to buy one of our industry clouds why wouldn't you? More works out of the box you'll get faster time to value. So it's a huge area of investment for us.

I think the thing that we do really uniquely though Marc alluded to it is it's really all-in-one integrated platform. If you buy our Financial Services Cloud you get all the capabilities of our Salesforce Cloud of our service cloud or our customer data platform all in one integrated technology platform. It's very unique in the industry. And I think in this more measured buying environment it will become even more important though actually it was important prior to this as well.

And I think it reflects our alignment with our industry's go-to-market motion and vertical go-to-market motion and really focus on delivering faster time to value to our customers.

Kirk Materne -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst

You last question today comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.

Phil Winslow -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst

Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to focus in on Slack. Slack again outperformed revenue expectations.

Obviously the large deal metrics are impressive too. What's driving the continued advance for Slack let's say relative to some of those other vendors that are heavier in the telephony or the video segments of UCaaS that have frankly have been delivering weaker results? And are you seeing strong call it stand-alone demand for Slack as a horizontal messaging platform or the Salesforce integrations that you highlighted driving more attach as a collaboration hub of Slack in the context of multi-cloud deployments?

Bret Taylor -- Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

Yeah I'll take that one. This is Bret. We are really happy with the performance of Slack. I think it's interesting we acquired Slack in the midst of this pandemic.

And now we're coming out of the pandemic into this new era of flexible work. Office occupancy rates are at historic lows. If you look at the lines of business that we serve like customer service I've met tens or maybe even hundreds of executive teams whose contact centers are no longer buildings. They're literally just in the cloud now and people are wearing headsets in their kitchens and basements to answer your phone calls.

And if you think about what it means to build an employee experience to build a customer experience in this new area of flexible work Slack is really at the center of those conversations. And that's why it was such a strategic acquisition for us because one plus one is truly equal to much more than two. When I talked about the innovation we're to deliver at Dreamforce it's across every single one of our cloud. We've been saying how do we help our customers whose headquarters is now digital transition their CRM transition their employee experience to this new era of flexible work? So we've seen great wall-to-wall engagements like Mercado Libre one of the customers I mentioned in my script.

But it's also really important that we've invested in integrating Slack with Customer 360 so that when we have a conversation say with a retailer preparing for Cyber Week we're coming not just with our Marketing Cloud or in our Commerce Cloud and our Service Cloud but with a Slack Connect channel that they can use as a command center for Cyber Week. That's key to our go-to-market motion. And I don't think it's at the expense of what you called stand-alone. When we land a deal say for a department -- marketing department Slack has such wonderful organic viral adoption that a year or two later we're selling to the whole company.

And I really think that's key to our go-to-market motion. And Slack is a relevant driver for every single one of the cloud and our Customer 360.

Marc Benioff -- Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

And I think a lot of the reasons that we bought the company that they really could benefit from our credibility with customers and our distribution capacity have really paid out. It's such a great product. And in June you probably know that Bret and I did the World Tour in New York. Many of you were there but the day before was the Frontiers Conference for Slack.

And if you haven't looked at the demo you really should because the product has come a long way since we bought the company. It's an incredible piece of technology --

Bret Taylor -- Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

Voice video. I mean it's incredible yes.

Marc Benioff -- Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

You have to see it to believe it. I mean don't you agree like it's something that's like really -- and for a lot of you are coming to Dreamforce I think you're going to see how a lot of our products have become Slack first. And also the number of integrations that we're going to be able to kind of bring forth how many integrations now do you have with these core clouds that you've been able to put together?

Bret Taylor -- Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

We have 12 integrations with -- and the reason there's so many is because it includes our industry clouds not just sales service marketing and commerce. But Marc you're going into something remarkable huddles which is the name of the new audio and video introduced now accounts for 34% of all communication inside of Salesforce. It's completely transformed the way we work and I'm pretty confident we'll transform all of our customers --

Marc Benioff -- Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

We've integrated Slack with Tableau which is really cool right? Because you can do collaborative analytics.

Bret Taylor -- Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

And with the capabilities we launched to allow you to talk to your data this is happening inside of Slack. It's just an incredible capability and as I said a relevant driver for all of our customer engagements and a wonderful way to I think drive and accelerate flag adoption that they would have had independently.

Marc Benioff -- Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer

But a lot of our customers still haven't seen this. And I think that's why I'm so excited about Dreamforce because when you come to Dreamforce and you see the keynote obviously this will be highlighted. And I think customers will see in real time. What we saw for example in Frontiers even we didn't really have the opportunity because COVID was so freshly integrated into our World tour Keynote which Bret and I have lamented many times.

But I think that when you start to see the incredible innovation that have happened in the Salesforce core clouds like sales like service marketing commerce even Tableau you combine that with Slack. You bring that into the Customer 360 with MuleSoft the single source of truth. The way it's all being integrated with this customer data platform I don't think anyone else has this vision or is trying to even to execute it. And I've made this kind of L'Oreal -- I told you the L'Oreal story I said quite a few times you're going to see that in Dreamforce in real time.

You can see many other stories because I think for us just trying to communicate our vision this is like probably the most exciting thing going on here. We just brought 500 of our top executives together for kind of second half kickoff and showed them what we're so excited about and I don't think anybody walked away not thinking that we've not only got a world-class product that's highly differentiated but we're really where a lot of our customers are trying to get to in the next level of their customer experience. And Bret's made the point Amy's made the point Brian's made the point that digital transformation is underway but we all know that every digital transformation is beginning and ending with the customer. And you've got to have this beginning.

You have to kind of begin with the end of mine when that's all about building this Customer 360 and you're going to see this at scale when we all get to Dreamforce and I'll look forward to your feedback then.

The target this time is Marmon Holdings Inc. a Berkshire Hathaway company which comprises 11 groups and more than 100 autonomous businesses with total annual revenue of $10 billion. The plan in question has about 14000 participants at the end of 2020 and approximately $1.1 billion in assets.

The proposed class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (Lard v. Marmon Holdings Inc. N.D. Ill. No. 1:22-cv-04332 complaint 8/16/22) with the participant-plaintiffs represented by the law firm of Capozzi Adler PC relies on many of the same arguments—and the identical language utilized in a number of the growing number of ERISA excessive fee suits the firm has filed.



Languishing in the Plan?

Here they note that plaintiff Jennifer R. Lard “… was subject to the excessive RKA costs alleged below. Plaintiff Lard suffered injury to her Plan account by overpaying for her share of RKA costs” specifically by investing in the Target Retirement 2040 Fund…” and further “…from the underperformance and excessive expense of this fund.” The suit goes on to claim that she “suffered injury to her Plan account by having to pay for her share of consulting fees to maintain any of the lower performing or expensive funds in the Plan whether specifically identified herein or not”….funds that according to the suit “were maintained and monitored with the assistance of Mercer Consulting who received at least $186535 during 2020 the cost of which was borne by each participant in the Plan. Further the suit claims that she suffered injury via the diminution of her balance due to those “high recordkeeping and underperforming funds which were left languishing in the Plan whether they are specifically identified herein or not.”

Identical claims were presented on behalf of plaintiffs John J. Juergens (who also invested in the Target Retirement 2040 fund) Gerald L. Robinson (who invested in the Target Retirement 2020 Fund) Scott W. Anderson (who invested in the Target Retirement 2050 Fund) Thomas A. Pitera (who also invested in the Target Retirement 2050 Fund) Sharon Bradley-Smith (who invested in—well she apparently split her investment in the Target Retirement 2020 through 2060 Funds) and Toranz J. Plummer (who invested in the Target Retirement 2060 Fund).

As in other suits where the plaintiffs were represented by Capozzi Adler this one takes the time to point out that “like other companies that sponsor a 401(k) plan for their employees Marmon enjoys both direct and indirect benefits by providing matching contributions to the Plan’s participants” both in terms of tax deductions the role such programs play in helping attract and retain workers and “given the size of the Plan Marmon likely enjoyed a significant tax and cost savings from offering a match.”

The plaintiffs here also claim to have drawn “reasonable inferences regarding Defendants’ decision-making processes based upon the numerous factors set forth below.”

‘Astronomical’ Fees

Here again (as it has in numerous other similar suits[i]) the plaintiffs described the recordkeeping fees as “astronomical” and according to the suit ranged from $137.79/participant to $66.90/participant between 2016 and 2020. The suit then listed several allegedly comparable plans (at least based on assets and in some cases participants) that paid recordkeeping fees ranging from $23/participant to $36/participant leading them to conclude that “the Plan with over 10000 participants and over $895 million dollars in assets in 2018 should have been able to negotiate recordkeeping costs ranging from $23 to the low $30 range from the beginning of the Class Period to the present. Anything above that would be an outlier especially later in the Class Period when RKA costs per participant should have been at the cheapest.”

At this point the plaintiffs state as fact that a request for proposal (RFP) “should happen at least every three to five years as a matter of course and more frequently if the plans experience an increase in recordkeeping costs or fee benchmarking reveals the recordkeeper’s compensation to exceed levels found in other similar plans—citing cases where similar claims were made as well as the NEPC 2020 Defined Contribution Progress Report. They also turn again to the 22nd Edition of the 401(k) Averages study which they claim states that “without factoring in amounts of revenue sharing as is done here the 401(k) Averages study found that the average plan with over 2000 participants and 200 million in assets paid no more than $13 per participant.” They then conclude that “the fact that the Plan has stayed with the same primary recordkeeper namely Mass Mutual throughout the Class Period and paid the relatively same amount in recordkeeping fees from 2016 to the present there is little to suggest that Defendants conducted a RFP at reasonable intervals—or certainly at any time prior to 2016 through the present—to determine whether the Plan could obtain better recordkeeping and administrative fee pricing from other service providers given that the market for recordkeeping is highly competitive with many vendors equally capable of providing a high-level service.”

TDF Troubles

At that point the plaintiffs turn to their concerns with the target-date fund suite in the plan noting that “the Defendants decided to create their own suite of target date funds a practice which is baffling giving the number of excellent target date suites available on the market.” And so as “the performance of the instant funds created by the Defendants severely lagged in performance as compared to readily available target date suites” they state that “…it was clear breach of fiduciary duty to have created these poorly performing target date funds instead of choosing from the many better performing target date suites with expected stability for each expected retirement date.”

They go on to note that “it’s a clear the Plan should not have selected funds that had been created days earlier which lacked any performance history” and as the current target date suite had an inception date of Aug. 7 2017—the same date the funds became available in the Plan “this is further evidence that the current target date lineup was created by the Plan.” However the suit also states that “prior to August 7th of 2017 the Plan had a similar set of target date funds which were created by the Plan. It’s expected that these funds would similarly have had serious performance issues as compared to readily available target date suites as compared to the Plan’s target date suite”—and then the suit presents a table with ostensibly comparable target-date fund alternatives.

“Clearly the fact that Marmon decided to create its own funds for the Plan was an error which cost the Plan millions in lost savings. Had the Defendants been acting in the sole interests of Plan participants throughout the Class Period as required by ERISA alternate better performing funds would have been selected and utilized as early as the start of the Class Period rather than allowing the Plan [to] languish under the burden of the funds created by Marmon its advisors and/or affiliates.”

These level claims have been found insufficient to make a “plausible” case to proceed to discovery/trialin other cases. Will this court be persuaded this time?

NOTE: In litigation there are always (at least) two sides to every story. However factual it may turn out to be the initial lawsuit in any action is only one side and one generally crafted toward a particular result. In our coverage you'll see descriptions of events qualified with statements such as “the suit says” or “the plaintiffs allege”—and qualifiers should serve as a reminder of that reality.

Billions of people embrace e-commerce and some analysts expect the online marketplace to virtually double in size by 2025. As the industry becomes more competitive organizations with outdated e-commerce software may struggle to seize a decent share of the market. In addition to inventory management features an e-commerce platform should have SEO tools social commerce features and a smooth mobile experience.

After examining several professional and user reviews the following 10 e-commerce software companies which include as Salesforce Shopify and GoDaddy stood out to help organizations meet their demands. Explore their standout features challenges who they work best for and pricing information.

1. Salesforce Commerce Cloud As a flagship Salesforce product Salesforce Commerce Cloud offers both B2C and B2B versions.

A comprehensive explainer | Mint,"In an effort to increase media investments as part of an ambitious expansion plan Adani Group led by the wealthiest Indian Gautam Adani announced on Tuesday that it would purchase a majority stake in New Delhi Television Ltd  one of the country's most watched news channels.

Shares of NDTV Ltd jumped 5 per cent to hit their highest trading permissible limit for the day on Wednesday after Adani group launched a bid to take over the media company.

But wait that’s not all.

Soon after this announcement NDTV issued a statement clarifying that this decision was taken without any consideration from the media house or its founder-promoters.

Yes you heard it right!

RRPR Holding Private Limited (RRPRH) the promoter-owned company that owns 29.18% of NDTV received a notice from Vishvapradhan Commercial Private Limited (VCPL) informing them that VCPL has exercised its right to acquire 99.50% ownership of RRPR Holding Private Limited (RRPRH).

Now you might be wondering how is this possible?

If the owners do not want to sell their company how can someone buy it?

However it is achievable through a process called a hostile takeover.

What is Hostile Takeover?

A corporation can be bought by another company through a hostile takeover. The firm that is being purchased is referred to as the target firm and the firm that is buying the target firm is referred to as the acquirer. The main trait of hostile takeovers is that the target company's management will not want the acquisition arrangement to go through.

Hostile takeover bids occur when an organization tries to take over a business without getting the target company's management's permission or cooperation. Instead of requesting permission from the target company's board of directors the acquirer will attempt to take control of the business by making a tender offer organizing a proxy battle or buying the necessary number of target company shares in the open market.

Still confused?

Okay imagine this.

What happens in a conventional acquisition?

The boards of directors of the target company would approve the agreement reached by the two businesses. Agreed?

However if the target firm's management is not open to a sale the purchasing business would approach the shareholders directly typically with a tender offer or an offer to buy shares at a premium.

The hostile takeover is successful after they have acquired enough shares to hold a majority stake in the business.

There are two ways for the acquirer to implement a hostile takeover.

Tender offer

When a hostile bidder makes a direct offer to shareholders to buy their shares for a higher price than the stock's existing market value they are said to be making a tender offer. Each shareholder makes their own decision on the sale of their stock in the company. The bidder wants to purchase enough shares to hold a majority ownership in the business.

Proxy fight

A proxy fight also known as a proxy contest occurs when a hostile bidder tries to remove board members from the target company. The objective is to fill the board with enough supporters of the sale. However proxy battles are less likely to be successful since it is challenging to remove board members because shareholders frequently support the company's management.

Coming back to the heating news that’s all over the place.

How did Adani group manage to takeover the NDTV company?

First the Adani Group corporation purchased a business (VCPL) that had previously been connected to rival tycoon Mukesh Ambani. In the case of NDTV the promoter (RRPR holding) obtained a loan from VCPL in 2009 for Rs. 400 crore to pay off an existing loan and the Adani group company has now exercised the option to convert that debt into a 29.18% ownership in the news channel business. Following that it has also announced an open offer for additional 26% ownership.

Joining the company 21 years ago while it was still in its infancy Dan Wang started her journey working with Biosensors now one of the largest manufacturers and suppliers of cardiovascular stents globally fresh from completing a master’s program on fluid dynamics.

It was a bold career move given she lived in Singapore and the role was based in California. However the opportunity was too good to refuse and she made the move.

“I joined the Research and Development team which was a fantastic experience because we developed the newest technology in the world at the time – the Drug Eluting Stent (DES) with biodegradable polymer. It really was the most innovative technology in coronary intervention” Dan tells The CEO Magazine.

This really developed my interest in this field because it’s something that can make a big impact on people’s lives.

While she didn’t run the team at that stage Dan was responsible for bringing the technology back to Singapore and setting up the production line there. “This really developed my interest in this field because it’s something that can make a big impact on people’s lives” she says.

Around 2010 Dan also made the most of the company’s leadership development program which pays for senior leaders to complete an EMBA program.

“I was lucky enough to get into the Nanyang Business School which was a program partner with the Wharton Business School Pennsylvania. I was excited to do something new and learn more about managing the business alongside my experience on product development” she says.

Fast forward two years and the study paid off. Being a leader in the company Dan was able to apply what she learned directly and quickly into the Research and Development (R&D) and Operations teams seeing things happen more efficiently. It was at this time Dan was promoted to a broader role as Vice President of Operations and R&D.

Partnerships as a priority

With supply chain issues impacting the medical device industry as well as the speed at which it is growing strong partnerships are essential. Dan says one of their key advantages is their long history of working together with suppliers to find solutions.

“It’s not only been these past two years that we have been working closely with our suppliers and they don’t just supply us with products. They also supply services and are considered our stakeholders” she shares. “So I want to grow the company and alongside this help grow our suppliers.”

She says this includes investing in supplier innovation processes in order to make Biosensors products safer and more reliable. This investment also enables suppliers to work on automation to make things quicker and cheaper.

“I believe they appreciate our feedback and our good relationship with them. We don’t see them as a supplier we see them as a working and strategic partner so we grow together” she says.

As well as boasting impressive tech innovations and sales Biosensors was featured in The Straits Times list of Singapore’s 150 best employers in 2021.

Dan says this is likely because as a company they create a lot of opportunities for employees to grow and develop. In return she says staff are willing to voice their ideas and innovations which makes their processes faster and more efficient.

We don’t see them as a supplier we see them as a working and strategic partner so we grow together.

“We also do an employee survey every year and look at all the responses carefully to determine where action needs to be taken” she explains. “Communication and transparency within the company is important. People know what the channels are they can use to share ideas or concerns and that we do our best to accommodate or support them.”

Refining processes

The company’s future is both bold and part of an industry highly regulated with a long development cycle.

“We need to invest and continuously invest in R&D to help the company create a sustainable future” Dan shares.

She says they’ve spent much of the past two years focusing on doing so and they have plans to invest more heavily and speed up the R&D program.

We need to invest and continuously invest in R&D to help the company create a sustainable future.

“We learned a lot during the pandemic” she says. “Because of the border controls and the loss of direct labour personnel at a time when it was not easy to get new staff from overseas we continuously invested in automating manufacturing processes to make them more robust and less reliant on manual labour.”

They also learned how to work remotely while still maintaining open communication channels and how to undertake management and practical tasks that were formerly only ever done in person. Dan says while she prefers an in-person approach they have spent the last two years refining their virtual systems and improving efficiency to great effect.

“This is life right?” she smiles. “It makes us better prepared to face any uncertainties difficulties and challenges that we may have in the future. It’s something we should appreciate.”

Norway Defence Minister Bjørn Arild Gram said: “The Norwegian-developed drone is a global market leader. It is used in a number of allied countries including the United States and Great Britain.

“The drone is used for reconnaissance and target identification. It is easy to operate robust difficult to detect and particularly well suited for combat in urban areas.”

Norway will also procure the anti-drone system Nightfighter worth $10.29m (Nkr100m) from British SteelRock Technologies for Ukraine.

The portable SteelRock Nightfighter’s effective jamming provides protection against drones.

It helps keep smaller patrols artillery positions and other resources safe.

UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: “Norway and the UK remain determined to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine.

“These cutting-edge drones will help give Ukraine’s troops a vital advantage on the battlefield as they fight to defend their country against Putin’s brutal and unprovoked invasion.”

Ukraine has specifically requested Black Hornet tech as part of its Army of Drones campaign and in direct requests to governments backing its fight against Russia’ aggression. The pocket-sized easy-to-use UAVs are particularly effective in getting fast over-the-hill views and video feeds of movements in areas surrounding the pilot’s location.

Weighing just 33 grams and measuring only 168 millimeters the Black Hornet is a nearly silent drone designed for deployment in hostile even GPS-denied environments. Teledyne Flir says the onboard electro-optical and infrared sensors provide the UAV with the same detection capabilities as ground options or larger craft. It transmits live thermal video and image feeds to operators during a maximum flight time of 25 minutes.

New imaging applications are booming from collaborative robots in Industry 4.0 to drones fighting fires or being used in agriculture to biometric face recognition and point-of-care handheld medical devices at home. A key enabler in the emergence of these new applications is more accessibility for embedded vision. Embedded vision is not a new concept—it simply defines systems that include a vision setup that controls and processes data without an external computer. It has been widely used in industrial quality control in the form of what are generally referred to as “smart cameras”.

A recent change is the availability of affordable hardware components developed for the consumer market which has drastically reduced the bill-of-material and their size compared with computers. For example small integrators/OEMs can find single-board computers or system-on-modules such as the NVIDIA Jetson in low volume whereas larger OEMS can directly supply image signal processors such as Qualcomm’s Snapdragon. At the software level off-the-shelf libraries have made specific vision systems much faster to develop and easier to deploy even in fairly low quantities.

The second change that is fueling the growth of embedded vision systems is the emergence of machine learning which enables neural networks in the lab to be trained and then uploaded directly into the processor so that it can autonomously identify features and make decisions in real-time.

Providing solutions adapted to embedded vision is critically important to companies in the imaging industry that wish to target these high-growth applications. Image sensors which directly affect the performance and design of embedded vision systems play a major role for larger adoption and its key drivers can be summarized by the SWaP-C acronym: decreasing Size Weight Power and Cost. A strong accelerator for new uses of embedded vision is to meet market acceptable price points which comes with a strong constraint on the vision system cost.

Optics Cost Savings

The first way to cut vision system costs is to reduce its footprint for two reasons:

As the image sensor pixel size decreases the intrinsic silicon cost shrinks because more chips can fit on the same wafer. The sensor can fit in smaller and lower cost optics.

For image sensor manufacturers this reduced optical cost has another impact on the design. As a general rule the lower the optics cost the less optimal the angle of incidence on the sensor is. Therefore low-cost optics require the design of specific shifted microlenses positioned on top of the pixels so that they compensate for the distortions and focus light coming from wide angles.

Cost-Effective Interfaces

Aside from optical optimization the choice of interface also indirectly impacts vision systems costs. The MIPI CSI-2 interface is the most suitable candidate to enable interface-induced cost savings as it was originally developed for the mobile industry by the MIPI Alliance. It has been broadly adopted by most ISPs and has begun to be adopted in industrial markets as it offers a lean integration in the cost-effective system-on-chip (SoC) or system-on-module (SoM) from NXP NVIDIA Qualcomm Rockchip Intel and others. Designing a CMOS image sensor or imaging module with a MIPI CSI-2 interface provides a direct data transfer from the image sensor to the host SoC or SoM of the embedded system without any intermediate converter bridge which saves cost and PCB surface and of course that advantage is even stronger in embedded systems based on multiple sensors for 360° vision.

These benefits come with some constraints. The MIPI CSI-2 D-PHY standard today widely used in the machine vision industry relies on highly cost-effective flat cables with the drawback of a connection distance limited to 20 cm which may not be optimal in remote head setups where the sensor is located farther from the host processor. This is often the case in traffic monitoring or surround-view applications. One solution for longer connection distance consists of placing additional repeater boards between the MIPI sensor board and the host processor—at the expense of miniaturization. Other solutions exist coming not from the mobile industry but from the automotive industry this time: the so-called FPD-Link III and MIPI CSI-2 A-PHY standards supporting coax or differential pair cables allow connection distances up to 15m.

Reducing Development Costs

Rising development costs often present a challenge when investing in a new product. It can cost millions of dollars in non-recurring expenses (NRE) and create pressure on the time to market. For embedded vision this pressure becomes even stronger as modularity (which is defined by the ability to switch image sensors) is an important value for integrators. Fortunately the NRE can be limited by offering certain degrees of cross-compatibility between sensors for example by defining families of components sharing the same pixel architecture to have steady electro-optical performances by having common optical centers to share a single front mechanics and a compatible PCB assembly by means of footprint or pin-to-pin compatibility to fasten evaluation integration and supply chain as illustrated in Figure 1.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRlZmVuc2Vwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzI1L25vcndheS11ay1uYW5vLWRyb25lcy11a3JhaW5lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Norway UK to Donate Nano Drones to Ukraine,"Norway and the UK are jointly acquiring Black Hornet micro-drones for Ukraine the Norwegian government announced Wednesday.

An unspecified number of the Teledyne FLIR-built drones and spare parts will be bought from the US firm for 90 million Norwegian Krone ($9.31 million).

The purchase including transportation and training costs is being made through a British-led fund to which Norway has contributed 400 million Norwegian Krone ($41.36 million).

The purchase is being made after Ukraine requested this sort of military equipment for its fight against the Russian invasion the Norwegian government statement added.

Ideal for Contested Environments

The drone is used for reconnaissance and target identification and is in service with several allied militaries including the UK and the US.

At 33 grams (less than 0.1 pounds) and 168 millimeters (less than seven inches) the drone’s small size lightness and ultra-low noise make it ideal for reconnaissance and target identification in heavily contested and GPS-denied environments the Oregon-based company stated.

The pocket-sized unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can remain aloft for 25 minutes and transmit live even thermal video.

$48 Million Drone Purchase

The company claims to have sold more than 12000 Black Hornets worldwide.

The Norwegian Defence Materiel Agency recently signed an agreement with the company to purchase an undisclosed number of the Black Hornets for 475 million Norwegian krone ($48 million).

The agreement requires the company to manufacture and deliver the drones to the European country within four years.

Additional Norwegian Assistance

The Norwegian government will also purchase a counter-drone system SteelRock Nightfighter for Ukraine.

The 100 million Norwegian Krone ($10.3 million) portable system manufactured by British SteelRock Technologies jams UAVs.

It is used to protect “smaller patrols artillery positions and other important resources” according to the Norwegian government.",,,

We look forward to continued studies to evaluate mechanical thrombectomy in these vessels and further emphasize the clinical efficacy of our technology” said Davis.

Endovascular approaches for distal occlusions can be more challenging and are associated with a higher risk of periprocedural complications as a result of a longer path to the occlusion and a smaller vessel diameter.1 This study was undertaken to assess the safety and reperfusion success of aspiration thrombectomy in patients with these occlusions.

Results from the study showed that TICI 2b/3 reperfusion was achieved in 92.7% (38/41) of patients and TICI 2c/3 reperfusion was achieved in 63.4% (26/41) of patients. The median score on the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale decreased significantly from 10.5 (IQR 7.0 to 14.5) at arrival to 1.5 (0 to 6.0) at discharge p < 0.001. Median time from access to first aspiration attempt was 10 (6.6 to 16.5) minutes and median time from access to final reperfusion was 21.5 (16.0 to 31.8) minutes. There was one instance (2.4%) of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in this study cohort. There were no perforations or other reperfusion catheter related complications.

""Distal vessel occlusions are considered the next frontier in mechanical thrombectomy for stroke treatment. The data from this study offer additional clinical evidence that aspiration thrombectomy using the Zoom Stroke Solution is both safe and effective for occlusions in the MCA M2 segment. Furthermore Zoom 88 provides an excellent intracranial access catheter platform for distal occlusions. Even in the most tortuous cases we have more than halved our procedural times with rapid initial and repeat passes to the distal circulation as needed” said Dr. Torok lead author of the study.

Or follow us on Google News

Tesla is increasing the price of its “Full Self Driving” (FSD) suite from $12000 to $15000 on September 5 when FSD Beta version 10.69.2 goes out for wide release. This is just the latest step in Tesla’s occasional but consistent FSD price increases. Each time the FSD suite gets significant new features or improves a great deal the price goes up by a couple thousand or a few thousand dollars. This has been the story for a few years as Tesla CEO Elon Musk said it would be.

When I bought FSD with my Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus exactly 3 years ago in August 2019 I paid $6000 for it. That’s a $9000 increase in cost in just 3 years or $3000 a year. In another 3 years the FSD suite will surely cost well above $15000. Right?

Note you can upgrade your existing car to FSD in 2 mins via the Tesla app — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 21 2022

There are many opinions on FSD and its cost. I’ll toss mine into the ring as well as someone who has had FSD Beta for about a year and who has used Tesla Autopilot since it did little more than stay in its lane and not run into the car driving in front of it. Included in this little op-ed are my thoughts on FSD progress the long-term vision for FSD robotaxis appreciation (or not) of cars with FSD on them and perhaps a bit more.

There’s no doubt about it: Tesla has missed targeted timelines for robotaxi-capable full self driving. There’s also no denying that FSD now performs several actions that it didn’t perform a few years ago or even one or two years ago. That said somewhere in between or on the side of those two points actual technological improvement has been a matter of much debate. According to some Tesla is on the verge of launching millions of robotaxis with a simple software update. I like many others am more skeptical and not thrilled with current capabilities or the seeming rate of improvement. While a Tesla FSD can drive from Point A to Point B on its own (with only human supervision) my experience is that it does so in a very jerky unpleasant and sometimes legitimately scary way. Furthermore it’s been hard to notice any progress in making these drives smoother. Again many people disagree with my take but I don’t know how. I went on a 5 minute drive to the bank today with the car on FSD mode and it jerked unpleasantly braked too much or didn’t act correctly in 7 or so instances. There’s no way I’d send someone on that 5-minute drive as a robotaxi customer (I know it’s not robotaxi capable yet but still …). Furthermore these problems seem to be about the same as they were almost a year ago. Perhaps users with a more positive take on FSD progress and I are experiencing very different things for some reason. I don’t know. Of course many people have the same take as me including people who — like me — were super bullish on the tech and Tesla’s approach in the past. I know multiple Tesla superfans who basically won’t use FSD.

One of my 4 top reasons for buying a Tesla Model 3 in 2019 was “Autonomy.” I definitely didn’t start off thinking that 3 years later I’d be having this take on FSD. I’d still like to think that Tesla AI progress will be so good that my car will eventually be robotaxi capable. That’s the dream. I hope it comes true. However I would not buy a Tesla and add on FSD today at an extra cost of $12000 or $15000. I don’t have enough faith in it. Of course if my lack of faith is proven to be a mistake I will be jumping for joy and hooping and hollering.

Despite all of those issues and concerns though there is one positive thing to write home about: the apparent market value of my FSD suite has gone from $6000 to $15000 in 3 years! Stunning! Who wouldn’t like that with any product they bought? That said … from what I’ve been told people who sell their Tesla vehicles with FSD equipped are not getting that same bump in resale value. People on the used car market will not buy a Tesla with FSD for $15000 more than a Tesla without it. So while the value of my car has increased by $9000 in theory from having FSD it hasn’t really. Oy.

But maybe in the future? Well as far as I can tell that all depends on how well FSD progresses. If it remains an ADAS (advanced driver assistance system) but doesn’t get to full robotaxi capability it just seems that fewer and fewer people are going to pay the premium for it. The “take rate” for FSD on new car purchases has reportedly dropped dramatically in the past few years further indication that while some people will pay a small fortune for FSD many are not bullish on Tesla’s approach and will not pay the rising prices. Of course if Elon and his AI team end up nailing it proving countless people wrong for the umpteenth time the commercial (aka money-making) usefulness of FSD will skyrocket and so will its value on the used car market as well as the new car market. It could happen. No one should say there’s a 0% chance of that — because we simply don’t know.

Naturally just like Elon Tesla fans and I can say “told you so” to anyone who said Tesla could never sell 500000 vehicles could never mass produce the Model 3 or Model Y and would be bankrupt by now; people who said Tesla wouldn’t have robotaxis on the road by 2020 by 2021 or by 2022 can say “told you so” to us. What about 2023 2024 or 2025? What about 2030? People can argue for their own predictions all day long until blue in the face. Indeed people have been arguing about this for the past several years.

Tesla’s stock price is set to drop at the opening bell Thursday but not because of anything Elon Musk tweeted about demand for electric vehicles ‘full self-driving’ features SpaceX updates silly memes or his legal battle with Twitter.

The electric car company completed a 3-for-1 stock split after the closing bell Wednesday. So one share now costs a third of what it did a day ago. Tesla (TSLA) closed around $891 on Wednesday which means it was trading a little under $300 Thursday.

Tesla approved the split in June its second such split in the past two years. But before you start celebrating about how one Tesla share is now “cheaper” keep in mind that nothing changes with Tesla’s valuation.

The company is still worth more than $930 billion after the split. Shares continue to trade at a lofty multiple of more than 70 times 2022 earnings forecasts — a huge premium to the valuations of traditional auto companies like Ford (F) GM (GM) Volkswagen (VLKAF) and Toyota (TM).

And the stock is still down about 15% this year as investors worry about growing competition in the EV market from traditional automakers as well as Musk’s many possible distractions. (SpaceX. The Boring Company. The Twitter (TWTR) takeover soap opera. The list goes on.)

The only thing that the stock split changed is that existing investors now own three times as many shares of Tesla trading at one third of the price they ended at on Wednesday.

That includes Musk the world’s richest person with a net worth of about $264 billion according to Forbes. Musk still owns approximately 15% of Tesla’s common stock.

Companies with high share prices often split their stocks to make the cost of one share more affordable for individual investors. The rationale is that some investors might be more inclined to buy a stock if it is trading at a lower price.

Amazon (AMZN) Shopify (SHOP) Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL) and meme stock GameStop (GME) have all done splits in the past few months.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2F1dG9zLXRyYW5zcG9ydGF0aW9uL3Rlc2xhLXNoYXJlcy1saW1lbGlnaHQtMy0xLXN0b2NrLXNwbGl0LWtpY2tzLTIwMjItMDgtMjUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla shares close lower after 3-1 stock split,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', ConnectionResetError(10054, 'An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host', None, 10054, None)) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2F1dG9zLXRyYW5zcG9ydGF0aW9uL3Rlc2xhLXNoYXJlcy1saW1lbGlnaHQtMy0xLXN0b2NrLXNwbGl0LWtpY2tzLTIwMjItMDgtMjUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzgvMjUvMjMzMjI3NTcvdGVzbGEtY29ubmVjdGl2aXR5LWx0ZS01Zy1zdGFybGluay10LW1vYmlsZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla EVs will be able to connect to Starlink satellites says Musk,"Elon Musk just announced that the upcoming second-generation Starlink internet satellites include cellular antennas for connections with phones from T-Mobile in the US and potentially other operators as well.

Following the event he responded to tweets asking whether the connections will work with Tesla’s electric cars which currently connect to AT&T’s LTE network. According to Musk the answer is yes.

He didn’t go into detail about how it will all work or how much data owners could expect to access from the connections when they’re somewhere out of reach by terrestrial cellphone towers. Musk said during the event that the satellite-to-cellular coverage from Starlink will be capable of providing a 2–4Mbps link which is shared by everyone in the satellite’s coverage area. That likely won’t be enough for some Premium Connectivity features like livestreaming video from your car’s cameras. Still a connection that works at all “anywhere you have a view of the sky” is better than no connection potentially.

Related Tesla is apparently installing Starlink antennas at some charging stations

In a comment to The Verge LightShed Partners analyst Walter Piecyk pointed out that enabling access could work similarly to an MVNO like Google Fi which uses multiple carriers as its backbone or that Musk could change the carrier deal away from AT&T in the future.

Over the years Tesla has scaled back the connectivity packages that come standard with its electric vehicles. As explained here cars purchased before the end of June 2018 include Premium Connectivity at no extra charge while cars purchased before July 20th 2022 all include at least the Standard Connectivity package with in-car maps and navigation. Those connections are available for the lifetime of the vehicle “excluding retrofits or upgrades required for any features or services externally supplied to the vehicle.” Adding the Premium Connectivity subscription to a Tesla that doesn’t have it currently costs $9.99 per month or $99 annually.

The recent shutdown of AT&T’s 3G network showed how that can come into play as older vehicles built prior to mid-2015 without an LTE-capable modem may have required a $200 upgrade to stay connected.

New or used electric cars purchased today from Tesla “will have Standard Connectivity for the remainder of the eight years from the first day your vehicle was delivered as new by Tesla or the first day it is put into service (for example used as a demonstrator or service vehicle) whichever comes first.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vcmVjb2RlLzIzMzE4NzI1L3Rlc2xhLXJlcGFpci1tZWNoYW5pYy1kZWxheS1lbGVjdHJpYy12ZWhpY2xlcy1ldtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Elon Musk and the future of electric vehicle repair,"A brand-new Model 3 delivered in desperate need of repair due to a faulty computer an inoperable wireless phone charger and a missing USB port. A supposedly fixed Tesla returned unfixed and with something spilled on the car damaging the paint. A dead mouse and rat poison discovered in a Tesla’s front trunk after a trip to the local service center.

These are just a few of the issues about Tesla service that customers have flagged in complaints filed with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Through a public records request Recode obtained details about more than 1000 complaints about Tesla including more than 120 customer reports that discussed specific problems with service delays and parts. These reports reflect a growing frustration with the company over its approach to maintenance and repairs — discontent that’s echoed everywhere from Tesla owner Reddit posts to online forums for Tesla shareholders to the more than 9000 reports that the company’s customers have sent to the Better Business Bureau. The complaints point to all sorts of problems with the experience of owning a Tesla vehicle including an inadequate number of service centers limited stock of replacement parts bad communication poor manufacturing quality and long wait times for repair appointments.

Part of the frustration is that EVs are supposed to be easier to maintain than internal combustion vehicles. They don’t need oil changes have fewer moving parts and use regenerative braking which means brake pads last longer. Tesla even says that it “designs every Tesla vehicle with the goal of eliminating the need for service.” Among car owners who do need service however Tesla drivers tend to visit service centers at nearly the same rate as the owners of premium gas-powered vehicles such as Lexus or Audi according to data the consumer research firm J.D. Power shared with Recode.

Tesla’s approach to service is also frustrating some customers. While automakers like Ford and GM enlist a network of thousands of dealerships and independent mechanics to fix their vehicles it appears the vast majority of Tesla repairs tend to be completed by Tesla technicians employed or authorized by the company. Tesla warns customers that damage or failures caused by technicians who aren’t Tesla-certified won’t be covered by the company’s warranty policy. In the past Tesla has also opposed legislation that supports the right-to-repair movement which advocates for making it easier for people to repair their own devices and equipment.

Meanwhile Tesla’s manufacturing output has historically increased at a significantly higher rate than the number of Tesla service centers which again the vast majority of current Tesla owners rely on. The number of cars Tesla produced grew 68 percent in the first quarter of this year compared to the same quarter last year but the number of store and service locations grew by only 20 percent. Meanwhile Tesla’s mobile service fleet — this is made up of Tesla mechanics that travel to a location of the customer’s choosing to complete repairs — grew by 35 percent. During the company’s annual stockholders meeting earlier this month some Tesla investors questioned when the company would increase its current service capacity which they say can’t support the number of Teslas on the road.

“Service has been a problem but it has not affected sales in the least bit” Rich Benoit who runs a YouTube channel focused on Tesla repairs explained. “So Tesla will not focus on this service issue until they see a decline in sales. So this really isn’t a problem for them.”

Recode reached out to Tesla with a request for comment about these complaints and to ask about the state of Tesla service. The company which disbanded its public relations team in 2020 did not respond.

Electric vehicles are still relatively new and many mechanics don’t have much experience fixing them. By contrast since internal combustion vehicles have been around for over a century it’s no surprise that there’s already a well-developed infrastructure for repairing them. Plenty of people still encounter issues with their gas vehicles but they certainly have more options for getting them fixed. Overall it’s difficult to make an apples-to-apples comparison about what ideal service should look like for EVs compared to internal combustion vehicles since the cars — and the way companies repair them — work differently.

That said major criticisms of Tesla’s service model have been around for years and it’s not clear that the situation is getting better. While CEO Elon Musk has long promised to expand service coverage it seems as though Tesla’s focus on manufacturing — and selling more cars to more new customers — still comes before fixing the cars that people have already purchased.

More Teslas more service

Tesla says that vehicles should be serviced on an “as-needed” basis depending on environmental conditions and how often the car is used. Certain tasks like rotating the tires and checking the brake fluid however are supposed to be completed on a specific schedule. In addition to the benefits that come with electric vehicles having fewer moving parts Teslas are largely operated by a computer — you can control almost everything from a giant touchscreen connected to the dashboard — so the company can do a significant amount of diagnostic work remotely. Some updates and repairs are even completed via over-the-air software updates.

Based on customer feedback service does not seem to be Tesla’s strong suit. Back in 2019 more than 20 percent of Model 3 owners surveyed by Bloomberg were unhappy with the timeliness of service. A Bernstein survey of people who owned Teslas in 2018 found that while people loved their cars issues with the company’s maintenance and repair offerings didn’t seem to be improving. The fact that Tesla advertises that its cars require less service might explain some of this frustration.

“The customer should have fewer visits to a service department per year right?” said Christopher Sutton vice president of automotive retail at J.D. Power. “But what we’re seeing is that at least for now it’s about the same.”

Shoddy manufacturing could be contributing to the high demand for Tesla service appointments. J.D. Power listed Tesla toward the bottom of its June initial quality survey — which measures how well new vehicles are built — and the company’s cars were second-to-last on Consumer Report’s 2021 reliability rankings.

Several complaints to the FTC raise similar concerns though it’s worth noting that the agency said it did not independently verify these complaints and redacted the names of customers. One Tesla owner from California told the agency that last October their new Model 3 required an immediate trip to a service center to fix issues with the car’s body panel. Another complaint accused the company of delivering their car with a coolant leak and then failing to address the problem promptly.

“Tesla has not in good faith tried to fix this factory coolant leak” the complaint reads. “They delivered a brand new vehicle with a major defect and after six months have failed to fix the coolant leak. They continue to delay attempts to fix it. This issue could permanently damage the car computer motors or battery and represents a danger to the driver.”

A limited stock of replacement parts can also draw out the service process. One owner of a 2016 Model S said that the company told them their touchscreen system had been recalled in February but that the parts needed to fix the issue weren’t available. Another complaint came from a hospital worker who said they brought their Tesla to a service center after its tire was punctured on the road in early 2018. Most Tesla vehicles don’t come with a spare and the service center had no tires on hand at the time.

“I had a full day of patients to see at different hospitals and had to cancel on them because I had no reliable transportation” the Florida-based customer said. “I love the car but I’m done with customer service. Last Tesla I will buy.”

A major problem seems to be Tesla service centers don’t have enough capacity. Complaints to the FTC and many threads in Tesla forums specifically mention lengthy treks to the nearest service center and weeks-long wait times and also call out Tesla for canceling pre-scheduled appointments. The EV blog Elektrek reported earlier this summer that Tesla employees who weren’t trained to repair cars were being enlisted to fix vehicles.

“Booking service at the centers is often a month or so out as every time I’ve needed service they’ve been booked out for weeks if not months. And it’s difficult to get real answers” explained Jason Fenske who posted a video about his experience with Tesla service. Fenske a YouTuber who focuses on cars says he loves his Tesla but argues that service is harder to schedule compared to his experience with Subaru.

Despite customers and shareholders’ concerns about service the problem may only get worse as Tesla builds and ships more vehicles. The company manufactured nearly half a million cars and SUVs in 2020 close to a million new vehicles in 2021 and aims to produce 2 million more by the end of 2022. There’s also significantly higher turnover at Tesla’s service division compared to its manufacturing division according to research from Snow Bull Capital which collects data on Tesla’s job postings.

Fixing the future of EVs

Tesla is well aware of challenges with the service side of its business and has consistently promised that things will get better.

Back in 2018 Elon Musk said that improving service would be a priority. Musk told a customer on Twitter in 2021 that the company would “expedite” opening new service centers and this June tweeted that Tesla was working on service in North America. He added that the company’s goal was to fix two-thirds of the vehicles brought in on the same day.

Now according to Musk’s latest tweets Tesla wants to employ techniques used by Formula-1 pit crews to fix as many cars as possible within an hour. Musk expressed a similar goal in 2015 after he hired F-1 engineer Kenny Handkammer to direct Tesla service (Handkammer now leads service for Lucid one of Tesla’s main competitors).

The growing number of Teslas on the road — not to mention the fact that many Tesla vehicles are getting older — will likely stretch the company’s existing service capacity even further. Major carmakers have nearly 10000 dealerships nationwide and there are thousands more independent mechanics as of last year. Tesla has about 160 service centers in the US according to Tesla’s website.

Some independent mechanics who have experience repairing Teslas say they’re picking up the slack. Benoit who runs the Tesla YouTube channel operates an EV repair shop and says he’s seeing an uptick in demand for repairs including a rise in appointments for Model 3s. Carl Medlock is also the owner of an EV repair shop who worked for Tesla for nearly four years and says his business has doubled in the past year. He explained battery and power train issues are his most common repairs.

“We have 103 appointments for Tesla Model Ss from 2012 to 2013 with bad batteries” Medlock told Recode. “I won’t take any more appointments because I haven’t even started the first one.”

It’s hard to compare Tesla with companies like GM and Ford since legacy automakers use different approaches to fixing their vehicles. But while EV service might seem like a Tesla-specific problem right now the same issues could emerge as more companies’ electric vehicles hit the road. Lucid and Rivian two Tesla competitors that started selling vehicles last year are already mimicking Tesla’s approach by combining mobile service fleets and their own service centers. J.D. Power notes that overall service satisfaction for EVs is still significantly lower than for internal combustion vehicles.

“Things are getting better for sure. [Tesla does] focus very much on the over-the-air updates very very frequently and they’ve got that really nicely under control” said Martin French a managing director at Berylls Strategy Advisors an automobility consulting firm. “If you look at how quickly Tesla put up a manufacturing plant I think once they’ve got an idea of how to solve the service abilities it will come very quickly.”

Time is of the essence: The Teslas people already own are getting older and many more of the company’s vehicles should hit the road within the next few years. All of those cars will need service at some point. But whether or not those cars will get those repairs quickly correctly and easily remains to be seen."

Kathleen Bell M.D.

Professor of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation

UT Southwestern

.…on long COVID.

As many North Texans try to move on from the pandemic Dr. Bell is focused on the “tens of millions of patients” who’ve developed long-haul COVID—and who are experiencing life-altering symptoms long after their COVID-19 infection cleared.

“People look at mortality rates but what they don’t understand is how many people are disabled either for a long time or potentially permanently from this disorder” Bell said in a statement. “It really does take a toll.”

UT Southwestern was among the first in the U.S. to launch an individualized outpatient rehab program—COVID Recover—to help patients restore muscle lung and brain function as well as mental health and psychological well-being.

But with more than 30% of hospitalized patients unable to fully recover after six months Bell says the impact on long-term productivity may impact the economy for years to come.

Bell notes that no consensus definition yet exists for long-haul COVID. But most experts agree that it entails having COVID-19 symptoms “that persist for an unexpectedly long period”—including breathing discomfort “brain fog” irregular heartbeat neuropathies and a loss of taste or smell.

To treat long-haul COVID Bell and her team employ techniques used for other long-term conditions including targeted exercise and rest.

“In terms of long-term health and productivity I don’t think we’ll be seeing the total cost of this pandemic for some years to come” Bell said. “In the meantime we all have a personal and social responsibility to avoid getting COVID and transmitting it.”

Bell’s parting suggestions will sound familiar to all: get vaccinated including a booster and mask indoors in crowds to avoid infection. You can hear her findings in a podcast posted by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

DALLAS — When you think of what makes a great employer what comes to mind?

Maybe it's the pay and benefits or perhaps the morale and culture of the workplace. Does your employer do a good job at motivating you combating burnout and helping ensure your safety and well-being?

Companies across America have had to navigate these waters while also trying to turn a profit in the middle of a pandemic. There are so many factors that go into what makes a great employer just that and everyone puts more emphasis on one thing than another.

Forbes – for its fourth year running – has surveyed workers in America to determine the best workplaces by state. The publication partnered with market research company Statista to anonymously survey 70000 Americans working for businesses with at least 500 employees allowing participants the opportunity to speak more freely about their opinion of their employers.

Forbes took the responses and compiled 51 lists – one for each state plus the District of Columbia – of the best employers in those states. When looking at Texas' list there were a number of Dallas-Fort Worth area employers that cracked the state's top 50.

Here's a look at which DFW employers made the Forbes list:

But some found that they struggled to maintain customer loyalty as consumer expectations changed and purchasing patterns shifted. As a result of formidable competition like Amazon they discovered customers have low patience for sites that don't present them with what they want. According to research from the Baymard Institute for every 100 potential customers 70 will leave without purchasing.

That's why Purva Gupta launched Lily AI an AI-powered platform that connects a retailer's or brand’s shoppers with products they might be looking to buy. Co-founded by Sowmiya Narayanan Lily provides algorithms designed to power web store components like search engines and product discovery carousels.

Lily today announced that it raised $25 million in a Series B funding round led by Canaan bringing its total raised to $41 million.

""Different shoppers search uniquely making it essential for retail ecommerce brands to build the right product taxonomy to capture both common and long-tail searches"" Gupta told TechCrunch via email. ""Think of your own frustrating experiences on retail ecommerce sites and receiving irrelevant results or worse no results at all even when the product you’re looking for is clearly carried by that retailer.""

Prior to co-launching Lily Gupta served in various roles at Eko India and UNICEF. Narayanan brought her experience developing software at Texas Instruments Yahoo! (full disclosure: TechCrunch's parent company) and Box where she was a full-stack web dev for the product Box Notes.

Lily began life as an app for retailers to help understand women shoppers' personal preferences around fashion. But when traction proved hard to gain Gupta and Narayanan pivoted to build a more enterprise-focused solution packaged as a plug-in software-as-a-service subscription product.

Lily now retains a team of ""experts"" in fashion home and beauty who help to refine product taxonomies which are then used to train algorithms for product search and recommendations. (The group also researches and develops ways to turn product attributes like ""ribbed fabric"" and ""minimalist dressing style"" into a mathematical ""language"" that the algorithms can understand.) Essentially Lily captures details on products based on traits (e.g. ""style"" ""fit"" and ""occasion"") and uses customer data from brands tied to the item attribute data to create a prediction of each customer's affinity to attributes of products in the catalog.

Gupta acknowledges that there are other companies in the product attribution and automated product tagging spaces that rely on automation and AI. For example Depict.ai provides a product recommendation tool that draws on data from across the internet. Black Crow AI is developing a platform to predict which products e-commerce customers will buy while Constructor sells access to a framework that powers search and discovery for digital retail marketplaces.

Meta has also experimented with apparel attribute prediction for Facebook Marketplace two years ago showcasing a system that could extract clothing attributes and fashion styles from photos of models on Instagram and Flickr.

But she argues that Lily is one of the more powerful options out there in terms of its configurability. Gupta also stressed that the platform is privacy-preserving to the extent it's able to be not using customer names addresses or financial transaction information in favor of using anonymized user interactions on its customers' ecommerce sites.

""The IT decision makers with whom we work are focused on the more concrete and tangible application of Lily versus being on the strategic frontlines. They are interested in the depth and accuracy of information Lily can provide; how we are training the models; and accuracy of output and confidence levels"" she said. ""We win with the customization of our product to deliver on their needs and a dedicated customer success team available to take into account changes to goals or results over time.""

In any case big-name customers have signed up for Lily's services to date including Macy's The Gap and its assorted brands Bloomingdale's and thredUP.

Lily is loathe to make its revenue figures public and the 87-employee company says it doesn't have a projection for the size of its headcount for the end of the year. Brushing aside questions about the secrecy Gupta asserts that Lily is ""well-positioned"" to capitalize on new retail verticals in the coming months even factoring in macroeconomic headwinds.

“Lily AI grew tremendously since the start of the pandemic as the health crises rapidly intensified the retail shift to e-commerce and digital transformation"" Gupta said. ""We'll use the new funding to further expand into enterprise and mid-market retail e-commerce brands across home beauty and fashion ... We also plan to extend our solution much deeper to further applications within the retail stack as well as further a suite of rich analytics for our customers.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N0YXRlc21hbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMi8wOC91ay1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLWluZHVzdHJ5LWR5aW5nLWxpei10cnVzc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The UK's semiconductor industry is dying – will Liz Truss save it?,"Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images

In 1952 Geoffrey Dummer a British engineer working for the Ministry of Defence was challenged with finding ways to improve the radar systems his team had pioneered during the Second World War. One of Dummer’s proposals was to lay an electrical circuit on a layer of silicon to increase the radars’ reliability. It quickly became clear to him however that the effects of the circuit would reach far beyond the navigation systems he was attempting to finesse.

Dummer presented the concept to MoD officials business leaders and then to the US Electronic Components Symposium in Washington DC. “I shook the industry to the bone when I lectured on the chip” he said in an interview two decades later. “I was trying to make them realise how important its invention would be for the future of microelectronics and the national economy.”

It wasn’t the British government nor its defence research institutes that would go on to develop Dummer’s proposals. It was an American company Texas Instruments that seven years later would patent the world’s “first” integrated circuit the foundational technology upon which the electronics industry and much of the modern world has been built. Semiconductor chips are now used to manage the flow of electricity in phones computers cars and household goods.

The origin story of the semiconductor industry should have served as a cautionary tale in Britain. Over the subsequent decades British scientists and engineers made some of the most significant breakthroughs in the sector. Yet as with the integrated circuit it has largely been overseas businesses that have commercialised that research. Even those companies that have successfully monetised British semiconductor advances such as Arm and Imagination Technologies have been acquired by foreign owners in recent years.

Two stories have drawn this issue into sharp focus since the start of the pandemic. The first is the shortage of computer chips which has exposed the fragility of global supply chains. As office workers returned home during lockdowns there was a surge in demand for laptops tablets and thus the semiconductors that underpin them. Disruption to freight routes and ports caused by the pandemic had however constrained supply of these components pushing up prices and causing long waiting times for goods including fridges and dishwashers as well as cars computers and smartphones.

The second story which has only begun to gain significant political traction in recent months is the dispute over the sale of Newport Wafer Fab. Nexperia an ostensibly Dutch semiconductor firm that is in fact a subsidiary of the Chinese company Wingtech acquired Newport last summer. The Chinese government has a stake of nearly 30 per cent in Wingtech according to the analysts Datenna. The timing couldn’t have been worse. As the US and EU were drafting plans to invest tens of billions of pounds in developing domestic semiconductor production facilities following similar moves by China it emerged that the UK’s largest remaining chip fabrication plant had been sold to a business part-owned by Beijing during a severe semiconductor shortage.

As Whitehall officials retrospectively review the acquisition of Newport under national security legislation the Department for Digital Culture Media and Sport is preparing to launch a semiconductor strategy. Industry experts however are sceptical about how seriously the government will take the challenge.

The sale of Newport is just the latest in a long line of foreign investments in British chip production plants. In the Eighties Newport’s site was occupied by Inmos which at its peak held 60 per cent of the global market for static random-access memory chips which help to power central processing units. The rise of neoliberal economic policy under Margaret Thatcher’s government meant that the company was left to the mercy of the market. The government’s National Enterprise Board was forced to sell its 76 per cent stake in Inmos in 1984; five years later it was acquired by a French-Italian semiconductor manufacturer and the brand ultimately disappeared.

In the Nineties as Taiwan became the global centre of semiconductor manufacturing thanks to government support Downing Street doubled down on encouraging foreign purchases. It encouraged regional development agencies to create packages that would attract foreign investors to the UK’s semiconductor sector. Companies in the so-called Silicon Glen in Scotland secured investment from the Japanese companies Motorola and NEC while Fujitsu invested in sites in the north-east of England. A fabrication plant in south Wales was built and earmarked for LG Semicon a South Korean company but it remained empty because LG pulled out during the Asian financial crisis. Such incidents became common. “The history of British semiconductor manufacturing” says a senior industry source “is littered with inward investment that has gone wrong.”

Today Newport Wafer Fab is one of just a handful of foundries left in the UK. Britain is still home to leading chip design companies such as Arm and Imagination Technologies but they have also been purchased by Japanese and Chinese businesses respectively in the last few years. Even those who are pushing for Newport’s acquisition to be reversed accept that the UK’s semiconductor sector is unlikely ever to compete with Taiwan where the Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company builds the cutting-edge chips found in iPhones.

Newport’s acquisition is significant however because of the role the site played in the South Wales Semiconductor Cluster. The UK government describes the network of businesses operating in the area as the world’s “first and only dedicated compound semiconductor cluster”. Compound semiconductors which are used to charge electric vehicles will play a critical role in the transition to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions as well as quantum computing. They are considered to be so significant that sites which can produce compound chips such as Newport Wafer Fab are explicitly listed as a national security concern in the legislation empowering ministers to intervene in the foundry’s sale.

After this piece was published a spokesperson for Nexperia wrote to the New Statesman stating that “no compound semiconductor capabilities existed previously and do not exist currently at Newport”. Nexperia said that before the previous owners acquired the site Infineon which ran Newport until 2017 had removed its compound semiconductor capabilities and that it had produced no compound chips since. But Nexperia’s UK country manager Toni Versluijs acknowledged in August 2021 that Newport had existing contracts with academic and commercial partners covering a range of materials including gallium nitride on silicon for radio frequency and that Nexperia would “honour the contracts”.

This is significant because the National Security and Investment Act explicitly covers sites which produce “compound semiconductors for radio frequency and microwave application including gallium nitride”. Newport may not have been capable of producing semiconductors using compound materials that do not sit on a silicon layer. But it remains to be seen if the government will determine that this is a sufficient distinction as to remove Newport from the scope of the legislation given that it is the gallium nitride itself rather than the silicon which enables the chips to function.

Nexperia has said it is committed to the site and the aspirations of the cluster. However Malcolm Penn a former Newport board director wrote to MPs last month casting doubt on these claims. In a letter seen by the New Statesman Penn argued that the company’s lack of cooperation with other members of the cluster had caused “major issues for both the associated academic community and the CS Cluster’s expansion plans”.

The cluster’s champions argue that while the UK is still seen as a leader in producing intellectual property for semiconductors businesses such as Arm create less value for the economy than manufacturers because they only take a tiny cut of the cost of each chip they help to produce.

Through the review of Newport’s ownership the government now has an opportunity to stimulate the growth of the sector again. Whether it will however is difficult to predict. Liz Truss the Foreign Secretary and leading candidate to be the next prime minister claims to be hawkish on China but her brand of economics is largely a continuation of the free-market zealousness that led to the sell-off and dismantling of the industry in the 1980s.

Seventy years after Geoffrey Dummer struggled to win over government officials with his proposals it appears that those working in the sector are facing similar challenges once again. “The fundamental problem” says the industry source “is there’s a complete ignorance and lack of understanding of what the semiconductor industry does and how it contributes to the national economy.”

Update: This article has been updated to include further details of Newport Wafer Fab’s production capabilities.

The work for the prototype was finalized just four months after a critical design review of the ARV last April at Textron’s facility near New Orleans.

In July 2020 the marine corps selected the firm alongside General Dynamics Land Systems to work on the prototype. The deal stipulated a 22-month development period delivery in the first quarter of 2023 and a six-month government evaluation in the third quarter.

“The team did an excellent job accomplishing the required design milestones to create a vehicle that meets and exceeds our customers highest priority requirements and in doing so in less than a year” Textron Land and Sea Systems Senior Vice President David Phillips said.

“Considering the complexity of the build it’s a huge accomplishment” he added.

The Cottonmouth ARV will be further assessed before its delivery to the marine corps for other government-led tests.

Force Design 2030

As part of Force Design 2030 the US Marine Corps requires the development of a vehicle family to equip its Mobile Reconnaissance Battalions.

The vehicles must be light agile and adaptive in the face of littoral water obstacles including rivers bays and estuaries.

“We can’t always predict what the next requirement will be. But we can ensure our vehicle systems are rugged survivable reliable and easily adaptable for growth” Phillips explained.

The $180 million project first announced in 2020 is a 300000 square foot state-of-the-art facility to double the company’s viral vector manufacturing capacity. This marks the company’s sixth viral vector site across the U.S. and Europe.

Thermo Fisher Scientific stated that it expects to add around 300 jobs through the facility which will support the development and commercialization of the company’s gene therapies.

Thermo Fisher Scientific CEO Marc Casper called the Plainville manufacturing facility an “impressive addition” to the company’s pharma services network and a key aspect of its growing investment strategy in the cell and gene therapy value chain.

“We are enabling our customers to speed their scientific discoveries in cell and gene therapy while also supporting their manufacturing needs whether they are early in the development process or ready to transition to clinical or commercial scale” Casper said in a statement.

The facility opening came less than a month after Thermo Fisher Scientific released its most recent quarterly earnings report.

Thermo Fisher Scientific is the latest healthcare organization to expand its presence in Massachusetts.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals announced in May that it planned to increase its presence in Boston with a new 344000 square foot lab facility in the Seaport district. The effort is expected to support Vertex’s growth strategy and expansion of cell and gene therapies research.

Expected to be completed in 2025 Vertex said it expects the new building to house roles for around 500 additional employees.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3Rvbmdsb2JlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzI0L2J1c2luZXNzL3RoZXJtby1maXNoZXItb3BlbnMtMzAwMDAwLXNxdWFyZS1mb290LXBsYW50LXBsYWludmlsbGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Thermo Fisher opens 300000-square-foot plant in Plainville,"Waltham-based Thermo Fisher the largest Massachusetts company by stock market value at more than $224 billion at Tuesday’s close has built a two-story plant that will develop test and manufacture “viral vectors.” Those are viruses modified to carry a normal functioning gene into cells to replace a defective gene causing an inherited disease. Gene therapies are intended to be a one-time treatment.

Thermo Fisher Scientific plans to officially open a 300000-square-foot manufacturing plant in Plainville on Wednesday that underscores the laboratory equipment supplier’s investment in the growing field of gene therapy.

Last Wednesday the US Food and Drug Administration approved the latest gene therapy Zynteglo from Bluebird Bio of Somerville. It delivers a potentially permanent genetic remedy to patients with beta thalassemia a rare inherited blood disorder that causes a reduction of normal hemoglobin and red blood cells and leads to insufficient oxygen. Like the first two gene therapies approved in 2017 and 2019 for a rare form of vision loss and for a progressive neuromuscular disease Zynteglo is breathtakingly expensive: $2.8 million per patient. But a Boston-based nonprofit drug-pricing watchdog the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review said the price is justified because of how much money the medicine will save the health care system. Patients with beta thalassemia need blood transfusions once or twice a month and other expensive treatments.

“Thermo Fisher Scientific’s new manufacturing facility in Plainville will be one of the largest of its kind and will deepen the company’s ties and expand its employee footprint in Massachusetts” Baker said in a statement before the event.

Marc N. Casper who has been chief executive of Thermo Fisher since 2009 said the Plainville plant will help the pharmaceutical companies that are his firm’s customers discover develop and manufacture gene therapies faster. The company already had five sites in the US and Europe that can produce viral vectors.

The Plainville plant began operating recently and employs 125 people according to a Thermo Fisher spokeswoman. It will add another 200 workers within two years.

Thermo Fisher employs more than 100000 people worldwide. That includes at least 3500 employees in Massachusetts at 15 sites in Cambridge Waltham Lexington Franklin and nine other cities and towns said the company.

The firm made a significant commitment to gene therapy in 2019 when it bought Brammer Bio a Cambridge manufacturer of viral vectors for about $1.7 billion.

The construction project has not been without problems. On Feb. 2 about 200 people had to be evacuated because a frozen pipe cracked leaking about 2000 pounds of a refrigerant according to state and local public safety officials.

Last year COVID-19 diagnostic testing business made up nearly a third of Thermo Fisher’s first quarter revenues — $2.85 billion of the $9.91 billion total. In the first quarter of this year COVID testing’s share of total revenue fell to less than 15 percent but the firm has thrived because of other core businesses.

Vijay Kumar an analyst at Evercore in New York told investors in a note last month that Thermo Fisher was a “juggernaut” that had made shrewd acquisitions including paying $17.4 billion for a North Carolina company that helps drugmakers run clinical trials.

The 300000 square-foot-plant located 40 miles south of the company’s headquarters in Waltham will employ 300 people and manufacture viral vectors which are critical components in the development of gene therapies.

This is Thermo Fisher’s sixth viral vector plant between the United States and Europe. The site has a sustainable construction design the company said with flexible lab and production suites adjacent to warehousing and offices.

Thermo Fisher revealed plans to build the site in May 2020 estimating its cost at $180 million and saying it would represent a twofold expansion of its viral vector capacity.

Meanwhile Thermo Fisher last year revealed a $650 million investment effort to rapidly expand its capacity. One of the goals of the investment push is to serve all stages of gene therapy development and production.

To that end the Plainville site includes translational science labs plasmid DNA manufacturing viral vector services cell therapy production and integrated packaging and distribution.

Thermo Fisher went all in on viral vector manufacturing in 2019 with a $1.7 billion purchase of Brammer Bio picking up the CDMO’s commercial-ready plants in Lexington and Cambridge Mass. and a preclinical and clinical-stage site in Alachua Florida.

The Plainville site becomes Thermo Fisher's second new plant this week after the company opened a $105 million 400000-square foot factory in Lebanon Tennessee on Monday. That site is Thermo Fisher's largest single-use technology plant and will eventually employ 1400 people the company said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitgFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVzdW5jaHJvbmljbGUuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWxfbmV3cy9hLXdvcmxkd2lkZS1wbGF5ZXItZ292ZXJub3ItYW5kLXNjb3Jlcy1vZi1vdGhlcnMtd2VsY29tZS10aGVybW8tZmlzaGVyLXRvLXBsYWludmlsbGUvYXJ0aWNsZV9jNDA2NDE0MS0zMmRiLTU2M2UtODlkOC1kMDRlYjZjMzk4ZDguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'A worldwide player': Governor and scores of others welcome Thermo Fisher to Plainville,"×

It’s just one example of how US consumers are changing their buying habits to cope with the highest inflation rate in 40 years. Americans are using their cars less buying cheaper food opting for more private label brands eating out less often cutting back on clothing and durable good spending and choosing to shop in inexpensive stores. In short consumer purchasing habits are changing drastically putting heavy pressure on retailers.

“Many consumers are cutting back on discretionary dining and seeking cheaper options on everyday essentials like gas and groceries while others are delaying purchases altogether especially for big-ticket items” said a recent industry intelligence report by Morning Consult.

This is the third rocky year in a row for big retailers. The pandemic was of course a consumer earthquake. Home confinement telecommuting transportation stoppages and hotel movie theater bar and restaurant closures all changed the way Americans and everyone else spent their money in 2020. For starters they spent a lot less. There were some winners like Netflix Peloton Zoom and Amazon and some clear losers like airlines hotels and restaurants but the retail hangover is proving hard to shake.

Consumption roared back in 2021 after the worst of the pandemic was behind us but supply chain problems prevented many companies from meeting demand. And just when retailers expected to have a normal year in 2022 inflation changed the rules of the game. Faced with high gas and food prices consumers are spending less on non-essentials while many companies stocked up on inventory in case supply problems persisted.

Less spending on home appliances and clothing

Walmart is the largest retailer in the United States. With its ubiquitous stores and $560 billion in annual sales Walmart is a bellwether for US retail consumption. “As the year has progressed we’ve seen more pronounced consumer shifts and trade down activity” said CFO Rainey. Inflation is driving consumers to buy more hot dogs as well as canned tuna or chicken. “Private brand penetration has also inflected higher” forcing the company to heavily discount some inventory. “We’ve cleared most summer seasonal inventory but we’re still focused on reducing exposure to other areas such as electronics home and sporting goods. We’ve also canceled billions of dollars in orders to help align inventory levels with expected demand” said Rainey.

Inflation is also driving more affluent customers to abandon upscale supermarkets in favor of Walmart’s price-competitive stores. “The quality value and convenience we offer makes Walmart a smart choice and we’re seeing more middle and higher income shoppers choose us” said CEO Douglas McMillon. Overall these changes have hurt Walmart’s financial results because food has lower margins than other products but higher food prices and new customers have partially offset profit declines.

Target another retail giant that focuses less on groceries has fared worse. Its operating margin on sales has fallen from 9.8% to 1.2% due to its liquidation of excess inventory. “An operating margin rate of just over 1% is well below anything I’ve seen in my career and something I don’t expect to see again” said Target’s CFO Michael Fiddelke. “Back in June we announced that our team would be undertaking a bold effort to right-size our inventory position in the categories for which demand patterns have radically changed” said CEP Brian Cornell. Even so the company’s inventory has grown by 36% over the last year.

Excess inventory

Kohl’s the largest US department store chain doesn’t sell groceries and has felt the full impact of changing consumer habits. During the company’s second quarter earnings call CEO Michelle Gass said “A weakening macro environment high inflation and dampened consumer spending are having broad implications across much of retail especially in discretionary categories like apparel. Given our penetration in these categories this is disproportionately impacting Kohl’s. Our second quarter results reflect a middle income customer that has become more cost conscious and is feeling greater pressure on their budgets. Therefore we are seeing customers make fewer shopping trips spend less per transaction and shift toward our value-oriented private brands.”

Kohl’s has also been hurt by its lack of flexibility. The company planned the season well in advance but got it wrong and was forced to discount aggressively to clear excess inventory. Kohl’s CFO Jill Timm said “If you remember last year we had lacked inventory. I think we quantified about $250 million of a sales liability because we were out of stock and we couldn’t flow the inventory given the supply chain disruption that we were experiencing.” This year the opposite is true and inventory at quarter end increased 48% compared to second quarter 2021. However the clothing category is riskier because orders are placed so far in advance. “As it relates to young women and juniors those cycles can change pretty rapidly. So we bought too much of some of the more fashion trend product and the customer wasn’t going there” acknowledged Gass.

Customers flocking to cheaper retail chains may be another reason for Kohl’s woes. TJX Companies owns brands like Marshalls and TJ Maxx that are well known for its bargains and frequent sales and operate almost like outlet stores. TJX says it is noticing that for the first time in many years sales at stores in more affluent areas are growing more strongly than in other areas. “That’s a big change from the trend of the last five to seven years” CFO Scott Goldenberg told industry analysts. The company says it is comfortable with the inventory increase and believes it is managing it flexibly. “We are confident that the combination of our value proposition our treasure hunt shopping experience and flexibilities will continue to be a winning retail formula.”

Eating out

The data clearly shows that overall consumption remains strong buoyed by job creation and a 3.5% unemployment rate the lowest in 50 years. McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski notes that the cost of eating out has risen less than grocery prices – the biggest gap in 50 years – and expects that this difference will attract more customers to restaurants.

But Chipotle the Mexican fast food chain doesn’t see that happening anytime soon. “Low-income consumers are clearly eating out less” CEO Brian Niccol told analysts. Morning Consult says “Despite slower price growth for food consumed away from home compared with food eaten at home most US adults still feel that preparing meals at home saves money.” But Chipotle’s main problem is that rising costs are forcing it to increase prices.

McDonald’s CFO Kevin Ozan is seeing changes in consumer behavior. “Customers particularly lower-income customers are moving toward value offerings and buying fewer full menus.” Kempczinski added “In the US we’re looking at what menu items to offer and how to add more value for the money. Is it through a special offer a menu item price change or a full promotion?”

Price increases

Some manufacturing companies with very strong brands like Coca-Cola Unilever and Kraft Heinz can offset costs and boost sales income with simple price increases. But it’s not so easy for most. According to a recent Deloitte report “A confluence of signals suggests there is little room for raising prices. Globally inflation concern is spiking. Consumer financial sentiment is flashing warning signals. And perhaps more importantly people believe companies are being predatory – using this moment of historic inflation to raise prices beyond their own rising operating costs. Trust is eroding and it’s likely to come at a cost… Whether or not businesses are charging unfair prices is irrelevant. What matters is that people believe it’s happening. And that’s an important factor for companies to consider.”

Even companies that have successfully passed on cost increases to customers are on alert. “We are watching closely for signs of changing consumer behavior as the year goes on and as the average cost of the consumer basket continues to go up” said Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey in the company’s second quarter earnings call.

“Over half of consumers have already changed purchasing behaviors in today’s inflationary environment” said Eric Belcher CEO of Numerator a market analytics technology firm. It’s a trend that is not likely to abate any time soon according to Morning Consult.

Some are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel. According to Target COO John Mulligan “… while conditions remain very unfavorable compared to the pre-pandemic years there are early indications that both costs and volatility may have peaked.” The company’s chief growth officer Christina Hennington added “It’s about reading customers listening to them and continuing to support agility in the business model.” Kohl’s CEO Gass was also hopeful “I think things will normalize but none of us have a crystal ball.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndqdHYuY29tL25ld3MvbWFyc2hhbGxzLXN0b3JlLW1vdmluZy1mcm9tLWphY2tzb24tdG8tbWFkaXNvbi_SAU1odHRwczovL3d3dy53anR2LmNvbS9uZXdzL21hcnNoYWxscy1zdG9yZS1tb3ZpbmctZnJvbS1qYWNrc29uLXRvLW1hZGlzb24vYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marshalls store moving from Jackson to Madison,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.wjtv.com/news/marshalls-store-moving-from-jackson-to-madison/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndqdHYuY29tL25ld3MvbWFyc2hhbGxzLXN0b3JlLW1vdmluZy1mcm9tLWphY2tzb24tdG8tbWFkaXNvbi_SAU1odHRwczovL3d3dy53anR2LmNvbS9uZXdzL21hcnNoYWxscy1zdG9yZS1tb3ZpbmctZnJvbS1qYWNrc29uLXRvLW1hZGlzb24vYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vbmoxMDE1LmNvbS9uai1idXJnZXItam9pbnQtZ2l2ZXMtcGFyZW50cy1mcmVlZG9tLWZyb20ta2lkcy1kaW5pbmctZGVhbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NJ burger joint gives parents 'freedom from kids' dining deal,"As a native New Jerseyan I appreciate bluntness.

City directors approved Resolution 52-22 regarding a shopping center during the city board meeting on Tuesday Aug. 16.

Members of the board voted 5-1 with Director David Allen abstaining from the vote. The shopping center will be a three-unit complex that should house Ross' Dress for Less TJ Maxx and Five Below according to City Administrator Phillip Patterson.

Patterson hosted a workshop on the development before the start of the city board meeting where he explained the details of the shopping center including a $1.5 million incentive package requested by developer Burk Collins and Company.

The incentive package includes waiving all building related permit and impact fees which is valued at $131613; extending city utilities to the project site which is valued at $165000 and will cost the city $58000 and reimbursing the developer a percentage of the projected sales tax revenue generated by the project totaling $1203387 for the first seven years Patterson said.

Burk Collins has developed similar projects in other cities that have approximately the same population as Siloam Springs Patterson said.

Developments include Market Street in Ardmore Okla. and most recently The Shops at McAlester in McAlester Okla. Patterson said.

The Shops at McAlester opened in April of this year according to John Browne the mayor of McAlester. The city of McAlester's incentive package to Burk Collins was $5.5 million upfront or to be reimbursed 90 percent of the sales tax for five years Browne said.

So far the Shops at McAlester has been a boon for the city Browne said. Retailers include Ross TJ Maxx Burkes Outlet and Hobby Lobby according to burkcollins.com.

""We are very happy with the deal we made"" Browne said.

Jimmy Cox the current president of Burk Collins said the company has specialized in retail development for 52 years.

""We have specialized in retail development. We have done residential industrial medical office as well but retail is the bulk of our business probably about 90 percent"" Cox said. ""Over those 52 years we have cultivated relationships with the retailers that are very near and dear and a large part of that as Phillip mentioned is we have found a niche market working in what we call regional hubs.""

City directors were mostly positive about the project although a few had questions about the development.

Director Lesa Rissler said she only spoke to Patterson a couple of months ago for five minutes about the project when she was in his office on a different matter and does not feel prepared to vote on this issue at this time.

""As a director one of the things I like to do is I would like to take the written copy of whatever I receive and take it to experts in the field and ask them give me feedback give me the pros give me the cons"" Rissler said. She went on to say she would like to see the board table this issue.

Allen whose brother is involved with this development only spoke about the administration of the agenda. Allen said he has never seen a workshop on an agenda that is then followed by a decision regarding that workshop.

Allen also said this is the first he has heard of this project and disagreed with Director Carol Smiley who said despite not knowing the specific companies involved Patterson had spoken to her and she believes other board members concerning this project.

""The info for this specifically only came out Thursday"" Allen said. ""So it is something that is detailed that has not been out and about for the public much less the board to see but I'm just saying historically we have never had a workshop followed by a decision of something this important.""

This led to a brief argument between Allen and Smiley regarding when information of the shopping center was given to the board.

Allen also said that when he was previously on the board it was common courtesy to table an issue if any board member asks for the tabling and doesnt't understand why there is a rush if one board member wants to do more research.

Director Reid Carroll agreed with Smiley saying that Patterson also spoke to him at the Arkansas Municipal League conference in June. Carroll said Patterson gave him some groundwork for it prepared the board's thought process.

""When I did see this I felt like I did have good information and I am in agreement with the percentages"" Carroll said. ""I like the research that's been done. I appreciate the gentlemen coming this evening so I feel like we're prepared for this.""

Director Brad Burns said he was not at the Arkansas Municipal League conference but said the information on the shopping center was brought out and that as an elected official it was his job to take a leadership role and make a decision now instead of dragging it out.

Rissler said all the board members serve the citizens but she serves the citizens in a different way because she cares what they have to say.

""I'm not here to represent myself"" Rissler said. ""I'm here to be a voice for the citizens. When they elected me they did not elect me to take their voice away.""

Rissler then made a motion to table the issue. The motion failed with a vote of 5-2 with Allen and Rissler being the only directors to vote for tabling the issue.

After the vote Rissler did say she is not against the project but felt she did not feel she had the time to properly research this issue.

Following Rissler's comments the board voted to approve the resolution.

Its rooftop solar array system will produce an estimated 6 million kW of electricity per year which will provide all the electricity needed for its operations achieving a Net Zero energy rating.

According to Tractor Supply this system is expected to be save the equivalent of almost 4700 tons of carbon per year. Tractor Supply is currently working towards several Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) goals one being to achieve net zero carbon emissions in its operations by 2040.

“This distribution center will be a vital link in our supply-chain strategy to better serve our existing stores and future growth in Arkansas Texas Oklahoma and surrounding states” said Hal Lawton president and CEO of Tractor Supply Company. “Tractor Supply is committed to a more sustainable future and our investments in Maumelle support a positive impact on the environment. We are grateful for the strong support for this project at the local and state level and look forward to a being a great community partner.”

Tractor Supply officials teamed up with global commercial real estate services firm Jones Lang LaSalle to select the site. The company will begin hiring for positions at the distribution center in October 2023.

Tractor Supply starts construction on new distribution center in Maumelle

08/25/2022

Tractor Supply Company of Brentwood Tennessee has started work on a massive 1.2 million square-foot distribution center in Maumelle.

“Today’s a very exciting day for Tractor Supply and our team members” said Hal Lawton CEO of Tractor Supply. “We’re really honored to celebrate this day together as we hit the milestone of breaking ground on our tenth distribution center right here in Maumelle and Pulaski County.”

Lawton along with Maumelle Mayor Caleb Norris and Arkansas Secretary of Commerce Mike Preston each recognized Entergy Arkansas for their involvement and support.

Once completed the $128 million facility will be Tractor Supply's largest distribution center servicing more than 300 of its stores and creating more than more than 500 jobs.

“Thank you to the entire Tractor Supply team. Your confidence in Arkansas your confidence in Maumelle it’s shown by your investment” said Preston. “You would not do this project if you didn’t have the confidence and belief in our workforce our elected officials and our willingness and drive to get things done.”

The Entergy Arkansas Business and Economic Development team worked with the City of Maumelle and the landowners for more than three years to make the location a certified Select Site and legitimately ready for a future employer and customer.

The 121-acre site was full of opportunities – and challenges – to meet the expectations of a prospective company. It had been listed and shown – unsuccessfully - for several years before Entergy Arkansas became actively involved and worked through the necessary criteria with city officials and the landowners to certify the site.

“There were a lot of challenges in getting the site certified and in competing for the project. The groundwork Tandee White laid with our certified Select Site initiative coupled with Chris Murphy’s work on the certification and project recruitment were key determinants in Maumelle’s success. The responsiveness among our central Arkansas engineering and distribution operations team is really helping us deliver” said Danny Games director of business development for Entergy Arkansas.

Tractor Supply was founded in 1938 and has evolved from a mail order tractor parts catalog into the largest rural lifestyle retailer in the U.S. with more than 2000 stores in 49 states and more than 48000 team members.

The retail industry has seen many challenges in recent years due to supply chain issues. The new distribution center will be a vital link for Tractor Supply’s supply-chain strategy to better serve its existing stores and future growth in Arkansas Texas Oklahoma and surrounding states.

“As the wife of a farmer and someone who grew up on a farm I know the importance firsthand of having supplies readily available” said Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge. “Our farmers and ranchers in the state of Arkansas a $23 billion industry will have that certainty thanks to Tractor Supply.”

“We think Tractor Supply Company is a great fit for Maumelle” said Norris. “I want to thank Entergy and their business development team. Without their process early on this really wouldn’t have become a site that would have rose among the other sites that were being considered.”

The facility at Champs Boulevard and Jackie Burnett Drive is expected to open in late 2023.",https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tractor Supply breaks ground in Maumelle for New Distribution Center,"On Tuesday Tractor Supply Company broke ground in Maumelle for their new distribution center.

Tractor Supply Company of Brentwood Tenn. which is the largest rural lifestyle retailer in the United States notifies that the space reserved for Maumelle will be a sizable 1.2 million-square-foot facility. The scheduled opening date for this building will be in late 2023 and will fully service over 300 Tractor Supply stores.

Tractor Supply President/CEO Hal Lawton was present along with Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge Arkansas Secretary of Commerce Mike Preston Maumelle Mayor Caleb Norris and other state dignitaries for the ceremony in Maumelle.

""This distribution center will be a vital link in our supply chain strategy to better serve our existing stores and future growth in Arkansas Texas Oklahoma and surrounding states"" Lawton said. ""Tractor Supply is committed to a more sustainable future and our investments in Maumelle support a positive impact on the environment. We are grateful for the strong support for this project at the local and state level and look forward to being a great community partner.""



The materials that will be used to design and build Tractor Supply's new distribution center are a mix of carbon energy water waste and other eco-friendly options. By doing this they will be able to qualify for LEED Gold certification by the U.S. Green Building Council. The rooftop solar system that will be installed will have the power to produce an estimated 6 million kW of electricity per year. This gives a promising conclusion that the rooftop will be able to generate enough electricity for its services. Tractor Supply is also attempting to hit Environmental Social and Governance goals. One of these goals will be to use zero carbon emissions within its operations by 2040.

Gov. Asa Hutchinson had this to say about Tractor Supply: ""Arkansans throughout the state know the value our farm families provide and Tractor Supply is highly regarded as a leading partner in meeting the needs of our farm families.""

""The investment that Tractor Supply is putting into its Maumelle distribution center will create hundreds of new jobs and demonstrates how Arkansas is a vital manufacturing and distribution hub” Secretary of Commerce Mike Preston stated. ""I want to thank them for the confidence they have placed in our workforce to help them meet the growing needs of their customers.""



Tractor Supply will be looking to fill positions at the distribution center in Oct. 2023.

Tractor Supply Company continues to expand its U.S. footprint.

The farm and ranch lifestyle retailer officially broke ground on its latest distribution center in Maumelle Ark.

The 1.2-million-square-foot facility represents an initial investment of $128 million and will be the 10th and largest distribution center in the Tractor Supply network.

According to the retailer the center will create nearly 500 full-time jobs when it opens in late 2023 and service over 300 Tractor Supply stores at full capacity.

Additionally the latest facility includes 50000 square feet of mezzanine space devoted to the company’s growing e-commerce business.

The schools’ old HVAC units — which were original to the buildings — were removed over the summer as part of cafeteria renovations.

“Glade Hill and Sontag cafeterias both had original floor mount unit ventilators that were heating only. These are the units that are being replaced with a rooftop unit that will have both heating and cooling. Two heaters in the kitchen area at Glade Hill also were replaced” Darryl Spencer the construction manager for Franklin County Public Schools wrote in an Aug. 19 email to The Roanoke Times.

As of mid-March the division expected those renovations to wrap up near the end of July with time to spare before the Aug. 10 return to school. However the ship date for the new Sontag unit was recently pushed back to the end of October with shipment of the Glade Hill unit slated for September.

At the Franklin County School Board Aug. 8 meeting a representative from HVAC unit manufacturer Trane Technologies said the company will if necessary help set up temporary heat as fall progresses and temperatures drop.

“We’re already working with the engineer and the installing contractor to come up with a plan to provide heat. That’s the worst case scenario” Rodney Bryant a Trane account manager said.

The division is using federal COVID-19 funds to pay for the new units priced roughly at $627000 for Glade Hill and $502000 for Sontag. Bryant said the availability of federal COVID-19 aid — which can be used for HVAC projects to improve air circulation — has fueled demand for HVAC units.

“A lot of that funding has gone to HVAC upgrades in our schools so it’s put a lot of stress on our factories coupled with the supply chain issues and ... the recent COVID outbreaks that we’ve seen that have affected our labor forces in our plants” Bryant said.

The Franklin County division is also using federal COVID-19 funds for an HVAC and roof renovation project at Benjamin Franklin Middle School.

“(The) Middle School East and West Buildings HVAC units throughout both buildings are original equipment. The chiller at the West Building was replaced in the early 1990’s. The roof on the East Building was replaced in 2010 and is in good condition. The roof on the West Building was replaced in 1997 and is in need of replacing due to age and condition” Spencer wrote Aug. 19.

In April the school board approved a proposal from RRMM Architects to design the renovations. In July Spencer reported that a survey of the West Building roof found no asbestos. He said design work was underway and a cost estimate should be ready for the board in December.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Survey respondents across six of APAC’s leading tourism markets show increasing preference for flexibility spotlighting why it matters where you stay when travelling for leisure business or a blend of both.

SINGAPORE – The pandemic has redefined travel and as leading hospitality company Hilton (NYSE: HLT) unpacks its newest survey findings1 travel trends spotlight how the past two years have not only changed how people travel but why. Results revealed the lines between work and personal trips have become increasingly blurred - with vacation time increasingly being added to work trips. This signals a need to establish new rhythms of rest and reconnecting emphasizing why now more than ever it matters where you stay.

“Our study shows that work trips are not only extended for extra down-time but leisure travel also needs to be flexible and connected enough to allow for an element of remote working or working from anywhere” said Ben George senior vice president and commercial director Hilton Asia Pacific. “More than ever this puts the spotlight on the stay itself and what the hotel experience can offer in totality. When you need to produce an inspiring presentation while on the move it matters where you stay — the environment food amenities make all the difference.”

Blurring Lines Between Work and Life

The rise of remote working during the pandemic has accelerated an always-on culture resulting in a greater want and need among employees to disconnect from constant video conferencing and the incessant ping of messaging apps.

43% of Indonesian and Malaysian travelers say they want to disconnect from work but among them 95% and 81% still spend some time working while travelling with family.

and travelers say they want to disconnect from work but among them and still spend some time working while travelling with family. Employed respondents from Singapore (66%) and Australia (64%) cannot seem to switch off their work mode despite saying they would like to.

and cannot seem to switch off their work mode despite saying they would like to. There is also the added stress of guilt associated with responding to work emails while on vacation according to half of the respondents in Indonesia (59%) Australia (58%) Malaysia (57%) and Singapore (54%).

Remote Working From Stunning Locations

At the same time there is an emerging preference among travelers to make the most of the remote working flexibility that more companies are now offering. Across the region gainfully employed respondents would choose to do some form of work while travelling with India (98%) ranked at the top followed by Thailand and Indonesia (95%) Malaysia (81%) Singapore (65%) and Australia (64%).

This corresponds with extended stays at hotels which offer an ideal environment for working from anywhere when it is preferred. Hilton’s booking data recorded an increase of up to two days in the average length of stay from 2019 to 2022 in Asia Pacific—with Singapore and Bangkok taking the lead at five and four days respectively.

Switching off? It matters where you stay.

While travelling has always been an avenue for adventure there has been a renewed desire among respondents to stay in and wind down — rather than to head out for more strenuous activities.

Across all APAC markets surveyed respondents chose sitting by the pool or the beach booking a relaxing spa treatment and taking a nap as among their top preferred activities to do if they had time to themselves on vacation2.

Whether this is a mindset nurtured from years of multiple lockdowns or fatigue from the stressors and uncertainty of the pandemic it is clear that wellbeing is a priority for the 2022 traveler in order to be freed from the pressure of being always switched-on. This highlights the importance of considering where you stay — where guests are taken care of to afford them the freedom to focus on what matters: whether it’s to work relax or enjoy the best of both worlds.

Covid obviously was a disaster for tour operators but not all of them suffered equally. Travel communities that formed in social media platforms like Facebook Tik Tok and Instagram saw membership grow substantially during the pandemic even when travel wasn’t possible.

But are these real travel businesses taking market share from the status quo operators or are they growing the market by filling a void? I set out to meet some of the people behind these groups to find out more.

One of the things I noticed was how important that community was to each group’s leader something that sets them apart from traditional tour operators. All of them started out as a safe place to meet online chat about travel and obtain information about destinations.

“We have travel products as a means to support the community not the other way around” said Mar Pages the brain behind Solo Female Travelers which has more than 188000 members on Facebook. Meanwhile Haley Woods the founder of Girls LOVE Travel said her group started running trips because that’s what her community wanted.

In addition the communities I discovered appeal largely to women. Three of them are exclusively female while the demographics of the Travel Squad also skew heavily female. Pages works hard to ensure her company’s tours are as close to 100 percent female-run as possible.

“No female guide no tour” she said.

It’s not just the guide though. It’s all the hotel owners drivers even right down to the porters on Mt. Kilimanjaro according to the company. Solo Female Travelers also runs a survey about the safety of destinations purely from the solo female traveler perspective and publishes an index now referenced by the U.S. State Department in travel advisories.

“When you are female and alone the risks are different [than] to other travelers” Pages said.

These communities attract like-minded individuals especially those who don’t have anyone in their daily lives or regular social circles with the desire to travel like they do.

“People in our community are worried they won’t meet anyone out there if they just go alone and understand they’ll have a better time doing things with a bunch of friends” said Alex Merritt the creator of The Travel Squad which launched during the pandemic and now has roughly 69000 members on Facebook. “We connect them up with likeminded people prior to going traveling solving that problem.”

Although their communities are growing those companies still have a long way to go in terms of raising funds and generating revenue. But they are hard at work engaging booking platforms to power their trips.

Girls Love Travel and Solo Female Travelers use booking platforms WeTravel and YouLi respectively to sell their group getaways. Meanwhile Merritt and The Travel Squad are considering launching an app as the company is in the midst of a seed funding round. Girls Love Travel previously went down this route before shuttering that effort.

That lack of tech hasn’t stopped those companies from selling tours. The Travel Squad sold in late April of this year $100000 of its Luxe Week trips to Bali in 24 hours while Girls Love Travel took 130 members on two sailings down to Antarctica during the 2018-2019 season. That would be $1 million revenue month even at the low end of Antarctica pricing.

However those communities are still navigating a murky post-pandemic environment. Amanda Black the creator of the Solo Female Traveler Network said her group wants to return to pre-pandemic metrics before it looks to raise money next year. Her community — as well as The Travel Squad — are the only ones that really discussed ambitions about becoming big players in the travel industry.

“We don’t want to be the next Intrepid” said Pages. “We just want to do really well for our community and for the execution of a business built on the principles of support of women empowerment.”

Meanwhile Woods acknowledged the vagaries of Facebook’s algorithms could help make her community’s future uncertain.

“It could all end tomorrow” Woods said. “Right now I’m happy we have this place for connection and support.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS90cmF2ZWwvMjAyMi8wOC8yNC93aGVlbGNoYWlyLWZseWluZy1haXJsaW5lcy1kaXNhYmlsaXR5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How flying could be improved for passengers who use wheelchairs,"Jessica Dalonzo was worried the first time she flew with her power wheelchair last month. She’d heard horror stories from other travelers and her manual chair had been damaged on previous flights. But the 22-year-old entrusted the customized device — with careful instructions attached — to Delta when she flew from New York to Orlando for a Disney World vacation. It was damaged upon arrival but fixable in about an hour. Things got much worse on the way home she said.

“They told me it never made it on the plane with me” she said. While she flew back to New York the chair ended up in California. Once it reached Dalonzo the next day she said it was broken again — and more than a month later still is. She said Delta will pay for it to be fixed or replaced as required by the Air Carrier Access Act. Until then she can only use the chair for short distances.

“We know our customers with disabilities rely on Delta for their travel needs and while the majority of wheelchairs and scooters enplaned by Delta are not mishandled we understand the frustration that comes when we fall short” the airline said in a statement. “We sincerely apologize for this customer’s experience and are affirmatively working with the customer to make things right via repairs and compensation.”

Dalonzo’s experience — though unique for its repeated bad luck — is far from a one-off. Since the Transportation Department started tracking in December 2018 through May of this year travelers have reported nearly 26000 instances of wheelchairs or scooters being mishandled.

Passengers with disabilities have also described long waits for check-in help; bungled security screenings; clumsy assistance transferring onto planes which can result in injuries; delays while waiting for wheelchairs after flights; slow and lax DOT enforcement; and a lack of recourse to hold airlines accountable.

“Practically everyone who uses a wheelchair and flies including colleagues of mine here at the DOT has a troubling story about an airline experience” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said during an event marking the anniversary of the Americans With Disabilities Act on July 26. “Many have far more than one.”

Travelers who spoke to The Washington Post said they’ve noticed preexisting issues get worse this summer as labor shortages and frequent disruptions continue. Disability-related complaints to the Transportation Department hit 158 in May alone more than double the number in 2019.

Airlines industry groups and federal authorities say they’re taking the problem seriously.

“U.S. airlines are committed to offering a high level of customer service and providing a positive and safe flight experience for all passengers especially those in need of additional assistance or traveling with mobility aids” Airlines for America a trade group said in a statement. “We are committed to continuing to work with the disability community aircraft and mobility aid manufacturers and safety regulators to explore safe and feasible solutions that reduce barriers to air travel.”

Advocates say they want to see more progress.

“I have seen a lot of airlines communicating statements that they want to become the most accessible and the most inclusive airline” said Alvaro Silberstein co-founder and chief executive of Wheel the World a booking platform for accessible travel experiences. “But I haven’t seen like real actions behind those statements.”

The Transportation Department has taken steps so far this year to address some major concerns involving accessible bathrooms on planes the authority of travelers to bring their own mobility devices on board wheelchair handling and more. But some of those moves might not result in meaningful action for years — or even decades. And a recently unveiled bill of rights for passengers with disabilities is just a summary of laws already on the books.

“They’re working on all this stuff ... but unfortunately it’s still baby steps toward getting to truly equitable travel” said Alex Elegudin president of New York City-based Wheeling Forward which offers services to people with disabilities.

He and three other travelers and advocates for people with disabilities said there is more airlines and the government could — and should — do.

Make airlines pay more

Carriers must cover the cost of repairs or replacement if a wheelchair is damaged or destroyed. But John Morris founder of the accessible travel site Wheelchair Travel who has been on more than 50 flights this year said they would have a greater incentive to improve if they were held more accountable.

Morris says that should happen in two ways: greater enforcement by the Transportation Department and private civil action by passengers under the Air Carrier Access Act.

One big problem: Travelers can’t sue airlines for breach of the act aviation attorney Tom Stilwell said in an email although they can use the law to define what an airline owes them if they sue under other state laws.

Morris said Congress would need to spell out the ability for travelers to sue under the law. Travelers who have a wheelchair that gets destroyed could lose mobility for months he said and may face a loss of wages health complications or other ramifications that would not be covered by an airline.

“I think that something that would make airlines take the Air Carrier Access Act more seriously is if they could find themselves in a court of law being challenged for their failure to deliver on their obligations” he said.

The typical recourse for a traveler is to file a DOT complaint; the department warns that its response “will likely take some time” and that if it levies fines those penalties are paid to the government not to the person who filed the complaint. Often an enforcement action will not include a fine but rather a demand that an airline stop some behavior. Morris said the DOT has “failed miserably” in this area.

The department did not respond to a request for comment about its enforcement of disability complaints. Its website lists six enforcement orders since 2017 including dismissals with penalties against four airlines that total $975000.

Make bathrooms accessible on more planes

In March the Transportation Department announced a proposed rule to make at least one lavatory on single-aisle planes — which fly the majority of domestic routes — large enough to be accessible to wheelchair users. Planes with more than one aisle already need to have an accessible restroom.

“Travelers with disabilities shouldn’t have to choose between dehydrating themselves or avoiding air travel altogether” Buttigieg said. “And yet to date there is no federal rule requiring accessible lavatories on single-aisle aircraft and we know that it’s time to change that.”

The effort has been underway for several years and appeared to make progress in 2016 with an agreement among advocates airlines plane manufacturers and others. But the momentum stalled prompting a lawsuit from a veterans group.

The rule is far from immediate: Under the agreement reached in 2016 it would apply to new planes ordered 18 years or delivered 20 years after the rule was finalized. Older planes would not have to be retrofitted. The department said it could adjust that timeline and is looking for ways improvements could be made more quickly.

Allow wheelchairs on board

Every traveler The Post spoke to said it would be a game changer if they could board the plane with their chair and keep it in the cabin. Most have to be transferred to a small chair that fits in an airplane aisle usually with assistance and then moved to their seat while their wheelchair goes under the plane. That increases the risk of both damage to the chair and injury while being transferred.

“No other form of transportation — trains buses boats — forces you to give up your mobility device when you board. The same ought to be true of airlines” Buttigieg said last month. “So in the months and years ahead we plan to work toward a new rule that will allow passengers to stay in their personal wheelchairs when they fly. We know this won’t happen overnight but it is a goal that we have to work to fulfill.”

Dalonzo said being able to bring her chair on a plane — and sit on it during a flight — would make a big difference.

“Just sitting on the regular airline seat is so uncomfortable for me” she said. “So if I could have my own chair I could go further; I don’t really travel far.”

Even if travelers would still need to move to an airplane seat once on the plane they said the experience would be far better than it is now because transferring to a seat on the plane could be easier if they boarded using their own chair and their device would be less likely to get damaged.

“I think that that is a tremendous opportunity not only for airlines but it would dramatically improve the independence and self-determination of disabled people” Morris said.

He said systems for securing wheelchairs would still need to be approved and regulated — steps that should be taken quickly.

“What I don’t want to see is sort of a cautious or delayed regulatory process like we’ve seen with accessible toilets” Morris said. “This is not something that people should have to wait four or five decades to see become a reality.”

Improve training

Travelers also said that people who handle wheelchairs and assist wheelchair users should get more training. Dalonzo said she explained to workers how to use her chair and drive it.

“And it’s still broken” she said.

Elegudin said he’s watched baggage handlers flip his chair on its side and upside down.

“I’ve literally sat in my seat looking outside the window and seeing them handling my chair and getting both furious and about to cry because I see what they’re doing” he said. “And there’s no way that the chair’s going to survive.”

He said workers need better training in transferring people with disabilities. He believes many are expecting older passengers who may just need to be pushed in a wheelchair because they can’t walk a long distance through the airport.

Make assistance jobs more attractive

Silberstein said that even in pre-pandemic times he did not get the sense that people who provided wheelchair assistance were happy in their jobs whether because of low pay insufficient training or other work conditions. Those workers are typically employed by companies that are contractors for airlines and depend on tips to make up for low wages.

Morris said improving working conditions — and paying more — would also help address the staffing shortage.

“Make the role more attractive to workers and you’ll see demand for the roles” he said.

Today 17 days after my last chair was destroyed my new temp chair (for which I paid thousands and purchased with the intent to keep long-term as a back-up) was returned badly damaged. It’s bent in multiple places and will never be the same again. I’m so tired of this airline. — John Morris | Wheelchair Travel (@WCTravelOrg) July 26 2022

Prioritize wheelchair users

Travelers interviewed by The Post said they frequently end up waiting on the plane for their chair or being moved from the plane to wait in an airline-provided chair until their own device is brought up.

Elegudin describes it as a “temporary rinky-dink airport wheelchair that’s not made for me.”

“And I’m sitting in that for a half an hour to 40 minutes waiting for my actual chair to show up from wherever it’s supposed to show up from” he said.

He said he’s traveled in other countries where wheelchairs are quickly returned to the disembarkation area — a much better scenario.

Find an airline leader

Silberstein who typically travels with an electric device attached to his manual wheelchair said travelers need one airline to decide to differentiate itself and take actions that are more friendly to passengers with disabilities.

“That will allow the rest of the industry to follow” he said.

Elegudin said the community needs champions — both in the political sphere and in the industry.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMjUvYnVzaW5lc3MvamFwYW4tc2RnLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Is This Colorful Little Wheel Suddenly Everywhere in Japan?

Aug. 24 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- As part of a strategic alliance Trimble (NASDAQ: TRMB) and CLAAS have developed a next-generation precision farming system for CLAAS tractors combines and forage harvesters.

Trimble and CLAAS Strategic Alliance Develops Next-Generation Precision Farming System for CLAAS Agriculture Equipment

The precision farming system includes the new CLAAS CEMIS 1200 ""smart"" display GPS PILOT steering system and the SAT 900 GNSS receiver. The CEMIS display utilizes Trimble's new embedded modular software architecture for positioning steering and ISOBUS technology for a seamless connection to control and monitor implements in the field. Trimble's new architecture accelerates the development of a customized precision agriculture system by linking CLAAS' machine interface and Trimble's guidance capabilities into one common in-cab user experience.

""We understand the operators' complexities of using separate displays with different user interfaces in the cab running the machine and performing precision farming tasks"" said Jim Chambers vice president of Trimble Agriculture. ""Working in tandem with CLAAS we have jointly developed a next-generation precision farming system designed around—one common user interface—to provide CLAAS operators the best-in-class customer experience.""

""As an experienced innovative and global provider of precision agriculture solutions Trimble was our first choice as a technology partner"" said Dr. Carsten Hoff managing director CLAAS E-Systems. ""Precision farming systems from Trimble have been field proven worldwide over the course of two decades. In addition Trimble supported by its subsidiary Müller-Elektronik brings outstanding expertise in ISOBUS technology which allows a display to control the machine and implement.""

The CEMIS 1200 display connects with the GPS PILOT system and SAT 900 GNSS receiver based on the Trimble® NAV-900 guidance controller for positioning and steering capabilities. This solution provides sub-meter repeatable accuracy ideal for tillage broad-acre seeding spraying and harvest operations. For even greater accuracy users can subscribe to CLAAS-branded correction services from Trimble called SATCOR in order to achieve up to 2.5 centimeter pass-to-pass accuracy without a base station.

Stephan Vormbrock managing director Market & Administration at CLAAS E-Systems: ""As a globally active agricultural engineering manufacturer we have chosen Trimble as a technology partner. Trimble has a global footprint and mindset which truly complements CLAAS' international approach. For our customers it's an invaluable advantage to have technology from partners who understand the different market needs.""

But perhaps more notable was some of Trimble’s competitors on the floor.

The main theme across the many sessions at Trimble this year was connecting via the cloud across competitive lines.

“Everybody understands (the cloud) is where the world is going. I think it took a while for everybody to believe that but I believe transportation is there now and they’re starting to realize they’re never going to be able to integrate this data and workflows until they get there” said James Langley senior vice president of Trimble Transportation. “What everybody wants is that truly integrated experience to be able to say it’s not about a TMS telematics maps; it’s about what the dispatcher needs to be more efficient. I don’t really care what applications it touches. I care about the workflow for that user to have a more efficient set of capabilities to have more actionable intelligence at my fingertips.”

The company’s focus during the event was on empowering and enabling carriers shippers and brokers to work better together by creating an ecosystem for all transportation stakeholders to be more connected and support more productivity and sustainability across the supply chain that has been incapacitated since shortly after the pandemic began.

The goal of Trimble’s Connect and Scale 2025 strategy is leveraging the cloud via its recent partnership with Microsoft to connect data beyond the carrier side to the entirety of the supply chain which Langley said still benefits carriers.

“We’re building from our carrier-centric base and you have to expand into the greater supply chain to solve their problems” he said. “Carriers only have visibility into so much freight demand. The more you get connected the more you gain visibility. The average carrier today is planning for today and tomorrow maybe …

“Imagine trying to optimize that every day. But what if you had the market intelligence because you can see into the shipper demand and be connected to get two days out how much more efficient would you get in your holistic planning solution if you could see what freight is going to look like 48 hours from now instead of [only] tomorrow?”

Trimble is partnering with shippers and carriers to provide visibility between freight and capacity to fix broken supply chains. The company has partnered with shippers to provide carriers with market insight including historical and current understanding of market conditions and robust analysis of key market metrics including rates times and speeds – all sourced from aggregated anonymized market data. It also provides insights to carriers – and shippers if a carrier chooses to share their data – of their own networks and presents actionable insights into key network metrics including velocity revenue empty miles percentage and balance – all sourced from a carrier’s TMS.

Linking these pieces and enabling data to flow among three customer communities – shipper/3PL carrier/broker and driver – Langley said enables collaboration across procurement (the right freight for the right carrier) planning (the right load for the right truck right now) and execution (pick it up and deliver on time safely and efficiently) creating a transportation industry continuum in which Trimble’s connected solutions and integrated partners support source-to-settle workflows for shippers and bid-to-bill workflows for carriers and brokers.

This occurs in Trimble’s Engage Lane transportation procurement platform highlighted at the event. The company which partnered with Procter & Gamble to gather data for the platform is in the process of launching it among carriers and shippers to include big names like Whole Foods and Waste Management. It already includes 70 lanes awarded by P&G.

Engage Lane provides a digital workflow of the bid process between shippers and carriers and simplifies EDI connection. Kelly Williams Engage Lane product manager said whereas it takes P&G three to five months to onboard a carrier Engage Lane connects shippers’ and carriers’ transportation management systems allowing order tenders as quickly as within two days.

Trimble also highlighted Connected Cab via Instinct its new mobile operating system that helps improve the driver experience with things like ELD data in-cab event recording and driver workflows and introduced its new Connected Maintenance platform.

Combining all these elements into one platform with cloud computing allows for network optimization and maximizing resource utilization which creates more sustainability said Trimble CEO Rob Painter.

“With customers sustainability is increasingly becoming a top priority” Painter said. “Trimble historically thrives at the intersection of productivity and sustainability.”

Operating better and faster he said naturally creates more sustainability.

He said if a fleet of 1000 vehicles can increase resource utilization by 1% it would save that carrier 1 million annual miles driven and add $2 million to that carrier’s bottom line while reducing carbon emissions by 3 million pounds.

Langley said a typical carrier runs about 15% empty miles and 8% out-of-route miles and the average trailer is only 70% loaded leaving huge opportunities to eliminate waste.

“It’s not about 100% utilization; every little 1% we get better has huge economies of scale for all of us” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mdXR1cmVmYXJtaW5nLmNvbS90ZWNoLWluLWZvY3VzL2F1dG9ub21vdXMtc2VtaS1hdXRvc3RlZXJpbmctc3lzdGVtcy90cmltYmxlLWFuZC1jbGFhcy1qb2ludGx5LWRldmVsb3AtcHJlY2lzaW9uLWZhcm1pbmctc3lzdGVtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trimble and Claas jointly develop precision farming system,"The precision farming system is designed around one common user interface for Claas tractors combines and forage harvesters.

GVL Starts is the signature program of The Hill Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship at Furman University.

By Tina Underwood

Merle Johnson the City of Greenville’s director of economic and community development was talking with officials from Furman University’s The Hill Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship about his biggest challenges. A pipeline of new startup companies was among his most-wanted solutions.

That conversation set the stage for the development of The Hill Institute’s signature program GVL Starts. The eight-week experience equips aspiring entrepreneurs and founders to move from idea to launch by connecting them with like-minded entrepreneurs and imparting the skills they need to fund and grow their ventures.

A collaboration among the city Greenville Local Development Corporation Furman’s The Hill Institute the South Carolina Department of Commerce South Carolina Research Authority and VentureSouth GVL Starts has earned the backing of Truist Foundation which recently awarded $75000 to the early-stage venture accelerator.

“GVL Starts aligns with Truist Foundation’s mission to work with organizations that strengthen the entrepreneurial spirit and enable small businesses” said Mike Brenan South Carolina regional president for Truist. “Through our partnership Greenville and Upstate entrepreneurs will be able to build the skill sets and networks necessary to launch and build successful companies. It’s also another way we fulfill Truist’s purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities.”

“Furman and The Hill Institute are honored to contribute our expertise to GVL Starts and to help entrepreneurs turn their dreams into realities. We are grateful to Truist Foundation for supporting our efforts and recognizing that a thriving inclusive entrepreneurial climate is critical for Greenville’s and the Upstate’s continued success” Furman President Elizabeth Davis said.

Since 2021 dozens of entrepreneurs have benefitted from the platform with another 28-member GVL Starts cohort kicking off Aug. 25.

By the numbers GVL Starts has:

Helped 53 entrepreneurs ramp up existing startups or explore ways to bring ideas to market. The group aims to accelerate 100 new ventures annually over the next five years.

Accelerated 38 ventures and launched eight.

Attracted a diverse and historically underserved set of entrepreneurs with more than 50 percent women and more than 50 percent representing Hispanic or Black businesses.

Awarded $30000 in startup grants to businesses ranging from restaurants to early stage high tech companies.

Raised more than $100000 in follow-on capital.

Amassed nearly 30 partners to bolster the program providing coaching co-working space venture capital legal assistance and more.

Eric Cooperman of Bottle Titan came to GVL Starts with a novel concept for a device that reduces spoilage in the high-end beverage industry. GVL Starts helped him secure funding to prototype the device and assist with legal matters.

LaShonn Edmunds creator of Cairs Shoes availed herself to GVL Starts to gain access to capital and get an audience with the right investors. “As an African American woman I had limited access to the ‘Who’s Who’ in my city” Edmunds said. “GVL Starts gave me opportunities to meet these people expand my network and get exposure for my business.”

The combination of Furman University civic partners like the City of Greenville and corporate partners like Truist Foundation is proving to be a winning model for creating economic vibrancy.

Following the sale of the Sunbelt Logistics Portfolio in June 2022 MDH Partners and a global institutional investor have secured five-year floating-rate acquisition financing of $650 million from Truist Bank. MDH Partners closed the $1.26 billion sale of the portfolio in June 2022. MDH continues to have an ownership stake in the portfolio and operates the properties. Eastdil Secured arranged the $650 million loan and served as the exclusive advisor for the deal.

“The closing of the Sunbelt Logistics Portfolio sale was a milestone moment for MDH Partners and the financing received from Truist Bank is a testament to the strength of this portfolio” said Arun Singh CFO of MDH Partners. “As the real estate sector faces headwinds from rising inflation and economic volatility we are grateful for Truist’s continued confidence in us.”

Approximately 47% of the Sunbelt Logistics Portfolio sites are located in four of the top 10 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States including Dallas Miami Atlanta and Phoenix. The portfolio includes 11 properties in Georgia; 10 properties in Florida; eight properties in Texas; seven properties in Arizona and Missouri; four properties in Tennessee and North Carolina; two properties in South Carolina and Virginia and one property in Kentucky. The Sunbelt Logistics Portfolio is 97% occupied by more than 100 regional national and international tenants with an average remaining lease term of 5.7 years.

“The Sunbelt Logistics Portfolio financing is our fourth partnership with MDH in the last two years” said Mark Hancock senior vice president at Truist Financial Commercial Real Estate and lead on the transaction. “In this rapidly evolving marketplace MDH is a trusted expert and we look forward to continuing our long-standing relationship.”

“With continued robust employment and population growth the Sunbelt region continues to experience significant interest from investors and lenders” said Mark Williams Managing Director at Eastdil Secured.

In October 2021 MDH Partners secured $69.3 million first-mortgage financing from Truist Bank for the delayed acquisition financing of a cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted portfolio encompassing 1052721 square feet of industrial assets across three markets.

In April 2022 JLL Capital Markets facilitated the $85 million loan between Truist Bank and MDH Partners for a fully leased 12-building industrial portfolio totaling 814888 square feet within last-mile locations in California Georgia Maryland and Minnesota.

MDH Partners has remained very active this year acquiring nearly five million square feet of industrial assets throughout the U.S. since last January.

Last year Zachary Norris was driving home from a hike in the Bay Area with his wife his two children and a friend when seven police cars converged behind him and ordered him to pull over. The officers approached him with guns drawn. He got out of his car and dropped to his knees. The police he said separated him from his family and pulled him into the back of one of their vehicles. Someone had swapped his car’s license plate with another—a common tactic used to evade law enforcement. An automatic license plate reader had identified Norris’s car as belonging to a suspect in an armed robbery.

The incident lasted about 35 minutes Norris said but the gravity of the encounter sank in when officers reunited him with his family after the police had detained him. “It hit me was when my kid ran to me and hugged me” he said. “At that moment it’s just like ‘What could have happened?’”

Norris was fortunate. As a civil rights attorney at the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights he cleared up the situation relatively quickly. (The Walnut Creek Police Department did not respond to a request for comment.) But he saw how algorithms that capture and process plate numbers can lead to confrontations that can easily become deadly. He joined the campaign to ban Oakland police from using license-plate readers—not just because the machines are inaccurate but because they make policing more invasive. Algorithmic technology he said was one facet of an entrenched system of police surveillance. Plate readers were “just a different tool layered on to inequality and discrimination and driving while Black” he told me.

Algorithms and artificial intelligence have dramatically expanded the ability of law-enforcement institutions to identify track and target individuals or groups. And civil rights activists say the new technologies erode privacy and due process. Community groups are beginning to understand the ramifications of AI for privacy discrimination and social movements and are pushing back. Across the country a grassroots movement is emerging to resist the secrecy of police algorithms and to demand that lawmakers ban the most intrusive surveillance schemes.

Through facial-recognition programs for instance an officer can grab an image of a face from a surveillance video of a protest and then instantly cross-check it against a photo database. A “faceprint” can also be used in a “face analysis” to try to extrapolate demographic characteristics such as gender race or even sexual orientation according to vendor claims analyzed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Beyond just identifying an individual face-tracking software can be used in tandem with other algorithmic technologies to trace the movements of a demonstrator as they travel home from a rally.

The technology is error-prone and often discriminatory. A recent study by the National Institute of Standards and Technology found that facial-recognition software misidentified Black and Asian faces 10 to 100 times more frequently than it did white faces.

In 2020 Detroit police apprehended Robert Williams as he pulled into his driveway. Facial-recognition technology had mistakenly determined that he was the suspect in a 2018 shoplifting case. According to a lawsuit filed by American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan Williams “was arrested without explanation on his front lawn in plain daylight in front of his wife and children humiliated and jailed in a dirty overcrowded cell for approximately 30 hours where he had to sleep on bare concrete—all for no reason other than being someone a computer thought looked like a shoplifter.” Current Issue View our current issue

Although police used the match to obtain an arrest warrant even the department acknowledges the limits of the technology. Detroit Police Chief James Craig stated at a public meeting in June 2020 “If we were just to use the technology by itself to identify someone I would say 96 percent of the time it would misidentify.” Still there is no definitive legal standard on whether facial technology can be relied upon to demonstrate probable cause for an arrest.

Other types of algorithmic monitoring have given police extraordinary abilities to track individuals. The New York City Police Department’s surveillance tools include software that can identify individuals including protesters in video clips that contain certain objects or reveal specific physical traits.

One of the major obstacles to challenging potential civil rights abuses via algorithm is the opacity of such “black box” technology which are typically developed by private corporations. The underlying architecture of the surveillance technology is generally obscured from the public hiding how the software processes data or makes decisions.

To address the lack of transparency the New York City Council passed the Public Oversight of Surveillance Technology (POST) Act in 2020 which directed the NYPD to create a surveillance impact and use policy and to report regularly on how the department was complying. Civil rights groups however say that NYPD’s disclosures under the law have been inadequate. Last October the watchdog group Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (STOP) noted that the police had repeatedly “refused to disclose surveillance vendors and tools” “hid the name of agencies that can access NYPD surveillance data” and failed to comprehensively assess how bias embedded in surveillance technology affect different communities.

(The NYPD did not respond directly to these criticisms but directed The Nation to its POST Act website containing policies for the use of different surveillance technologies.)

Clarence Okoh a lawyer with the Center for Law and Social Policy estimates that “virtually every single law enforcement agency in the country has some type of algorithmic-enabled technology.” Yet from a civil rights standpoint “there’s a major rights remedy gap because the laws that were designed to protect us from discriminatory harms that flow from business and government practices were designed at the time where you had human decision makers.”

State and local governments are grappling with how to regulate law enforcement’s use of algorithmic surveillance. In recent years at least 17 cities have banned the government from using facial recognition including Minneapolis Pittsburgh and New Orleans. But the restrictions have faced formal and informal resistance from law enforcement and legislators. Virginia for example barred local police from using facial recognition but the legislature loosened the prohibition this year to permit facial recognition in select circumstances such as identifying a suspect using a police photograph database.

In Alameda County Calif. activists have accused local police of systematically violating an existing ban. Immigrant rights groups Mijente and NorCal Resist along with several individuals sued Clearview AI a secretive facial-recognition company for providing police and the Alameda district attorney access to its image database of more than 3 billion photos scraped from the web and social media. Investigators allegedly circumvented the law by using Clearview’s software on a free trial basis. The lawsuit charges Clearview with privacy violations and the law enforcement agencies with free-speech violations because using the database made the plaintiffs vulnerable to “being targeted harassed and surveilled as a result of their advocacy efforts.” The suit is one of several legal challenges that civil liberties groups have brought against Clearview one of which resulted in significant limits on the company’s collaboration with police in Illinois earlier this year.

Steven Renderos the executive director of the advocacy organization MediaJustice and a named plaintiff in the Alameda lawsuit said it felt “creepy” but not surprising when he discovered his own image in the Clearview AI database—photos of him taken at political events and posted to social media. While protest is intended to make people politically visible he said “scraping the web and building out this massive database that Clearview then turns around and sells to law enforcement [is] putting people’s political participation at risk and creating a chilling effect for people that will feel less likely to want to engage in that kind of behavior in the future.”

Policing the future

An even more controversial area of algorithmic surveillance involves anticipating crimes through “predictive policing.” In recent years police departments and criminal court systems throughout the country have used programs to calculate the likelihood that an individual will commit a crime or whether a person held in pretrial detention should be released by a judge on bail. The technology uses information like a person’s age education level marital status criminal record or history of substance use disorder to make a determination. Rights groups say it “tech washes” profiling and discrimination effectively outsourcing discrimination to artificial intelligence rather than human judgment. Some—but not all—of these programs have ended amid public outcry.

“I don’t see algorithms as fundamentally changing the way police departments police.… What’s different is the unprecedented power and scope of these technologies or Big Data analytical capabilities and the purported badge of objectivity that this brings” said Meena Roldán Oberdick an attorney at the civil rights organization Latino Justice. “Using large-scale crime analysis or predictive policing technologies allows police departments to…abdicate responsibility for decision-making to data or machines.”

Civil rights groups are also increasingly concerned that algorithmic assessments are bringing predictive policing into schools. A Tampa Bay Times investigation revealed that in Pasco County Fla. the sheriff’s office has been tracking public school students based on data shared by the school district and child welfare authorities—from their grades to disciplinary issues to reports of abuse or drug use—and placing certain students on a list of “at risk” individuals. The sheriff’s office claims the list is used to identify children’s needs for social services and behavioral interventions. In a statement to The Nation the sheriff’s office stated that it did not use predictive policing but instead had adopted a crime-fighting strategy known as “intelligence-led policing” which “works with those who have shown a consistent pattern of offending to attempt to break the cycle of recidivism.”

But Beverly Ledbetter a local activist who taught in Pasco County schools for over three decades fears that police are drawing schoolchildren into a cycle of intervention: “Any time something happens in a neighborhood if that child lives in that neighborhood they are one of the first suspects…because they have been identified as a potential future criminal.” Related Articles People Who Have Abortions vs. the Police Renee Bracey Sherman Biden’s Executive Order on Police Reform Is Too Little Too Late Elie Mystal Do We Need Police?

Algorithmic Accountability

While rights advocates keep challenging algorithmic surveillance in courts they also emphasize the limitations of the law. Litigation often comes too late to help the communities most affected by algorithm-driven assessments which tend to be poor overpoliced and racialized.

Juyoun Han a partner of the digital technology and human rights group at the law firm Eisenberg & Baum said “Reactive litigation is so disheartening because once harm has been found and felt by the use of algorithmic decision-making systems that means there were millions of the same cases that have already touched millions of people’s lives.”

The legislative landscape around algorithms is evolving. In addition to state and local laws curbing or requiring disclosure for facial recognition and other biometric tools used by police and other government agencies Democratic Senator Ron Wyden introduced the Algorithmic Accountability Act aimed at tackling algorithmic discrimination. The legislation would authorize the Federal Trade Commission to investigate and document private-sector uses of algorithms. The bill has not moved since it was introduced in February though the Federal Trade Commission has announced plans to strengthen its oversight of algorithms in business transactions.

Other proposed bills would regulate algorithms on social media platforms to clamp down on socially harmful content. But these federal initiatives focus on algorithms used in private commerce rather than in police investigations or court decisions. The legislation often calls for auditing technology for potential bias but activists are skeptical about the effectiveness of audits given the lack of independent industry-wide ethical standards for evaluating algorithmic systems.

Albert Fox Cahn the executive director of STOP said “we don’t actually have consensus standards for what a good algorithmic audit looks like.” Instead STOP advocates for a “moratorium on a lot of uses of algorithmic systems” enacted through state regulation or a presidential executive order.

Renderos of MediaJustice is now helping to lead campaigns against tech firms like Amazon and Palantir which have both supplied surveillance tools to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The aim is to shift the political conversation around algorithmic surveillance from a technical policy debate to an abolitionist discourse about the role that technology should or shouldn’t play in the governance and policing of vulnerable communities.

For activists the first step is ensuring democratic control of the government’s technology infrastructure. This could take the form of community-based oversight bodies that can preemptively review any new technology that a local law-enforcement agency wants to use. A model known as Community Control over Police Surveillance is in place in more than 20 municipalities. It requires public buy-in before police adopt new surveillance technologies. The government could also establish an algorithm oversight agency analogous to the Food and Drug Administration or an environmental regulator to investigate new software before it is authorized for public use.

For some rights advocates however the end goal is not curbing algorithmic surveillance but forcing government agencies to drop the technology altogether. “We need space and time for us to consider what sorts of policies we can put in place” Renderos said “What sort of protections do we need to put in place to ensure that we can prevent harm from happening…[and] have a real pathway towards repair if harm does happen?”

STOP argues that more surveillance does not mean more safety and that the burden of proof should be on the state to prove that the public benefits of new algorithmic technologies outweigh the risks. In the absence of an effective regulatory regime “the hope is to invert the American legal presumption that police are allowed to use these surveillance technologies unless they’ve been outlawed” Cahn told me “Instead we need to go to a model where they’re only permitted once the public has actively consented which with many of the systems the public simply would not do.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmcm90ZWNoLmNvbS90eWxlci1wZXJyeS13ZW50LWZyb20taG9tZWxlc3MtdG8tYmlsbGlvbmFpcmUtc3RhdHVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tyler Perry Says He Was Once 'Homeless And Starving' But 'Praying And Believing' Led Him To Success And A Billion ...,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.afrotech.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /tyler-perry-went-from-homeless-to-billionaire-status (Caused by SSLError(CertificateError(""hostname 'www.afrotech.com' doesn't match 'afrotech.com'""))) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmcm90ZWNoLmNvbS90eWxlci1wZXJyeS13ZW50LWZyb20taG9tZWxlc3MtdG8tYmlsbGlvbmFpcmUtc3RhdHVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sdWJib2Nrb25saW5lLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcG9ydHMvY29sbGVnZS9yZWQtcmFpZGVycy8yMDIyLzA4LzI1L3RleGFzLXRlY2gtZm9vdGJhbGxzLWRlZmVuc2l2ZS1iYWNrcy1kZXB0aC1jaGFydC1wb3NpdGlvbi1hbmFseXNpcy82NTQxNzA3NTAwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Texas Tech football's defensive backs depth chart position analysis,"Defensive backs

In August 2021 Washington Post columnist Gene Weingarten penned a piece that mentioned his profound dislike for Indian food which according to him was defined by a single spice: “curry.” The response was immediate and fierce; Mindy Kaling questioned the article’s point while Top Chef’s Padma Lakshmi called it ignorant and racist. The same summer BuzzFeed reposted a video by food vlogger Chaheti Bansal calling for the term “Indian curry” to be canceled altogether. “There’s a saying that the food in India changes every 100 km” Bansal asserted “and yet we’re still using this umbrella term popularized by white people who couldn’t be bothered to learn the actual names of our dishes.”

Of course as Weingarten was schooled “curry” is not a single spice: While the curry leaf is used as an ingredient in some South Asian dishes curry powder is a varying mixture of spices one that is rarely found in Indian households. According to Top Chef contestant and cooking teacher Amirah Islam the word “curry” may have derived from the Tamil word “kari” which means spiced sauce. When the Portuguese invaded India in the 15th century they began using the word “carree” to describe broths poured over rice.

“Curry is a term that became popularized via colonialism.”

Two centuries later British colonizers began reworking local dishes to their palates and referring to all of them as curries. Indian merchants capitalized on the situation by commercializing curry powder and selling it to the British who began using it in their versions of Indian dishes. Later curry became linked to harmful stereotypes like the term “curry-muncher.”

“Curry is a term that became popularized via colonialism” says Anita Mannur author of Culinary Fictions: Food in South Asian Diasporic Culture and a professor of English at Miami University of Ohio. “If colonialism is a system of power part of that power comes from the ability to name simplify and take away complexity. So shorthands enter lexicons—and curry is one of those.”

Since the early 1900s Punjabi people have made up a large share of South Asian immigrants into the United States and North Indian cuisine—or Mughlai cuisine as it is known in India—has dominated the South Asian food scene in the West. And it’s a particular form of Mughlai food heavy on spiced sauces often referred to by Americans as curries that has been further assimilated to Western tastes says Sana Javeri Kadri who was raised in Mumbai and now lives in the Bay Area and founded a spice company called Diaspora Co. This adaptation of tastes flattens our understanding of the diversity of South Asian food Javeri Kadri argues—“it does everybody a disservice.”

As chef and activist Preeti Mistry sees it referring to all Indian food as curry is “a way to devalue and collapse as if somehow our food is a monolith. It comes from not understanding and not wanting to.” Mistry whose family hails from the Indian state of Gujarat ran a restaurant in Oakland called Juhu Beach Club until 2018 serving up Indian street food and homestyle specialties. Once a chef on a food tour didn’t want to stop at Juhu because “they didn’t like curry” Mistry recalls. “I took offense because this was someone who knew me and my food who was still choosing to dumb it down like this.”

Given curry’s speckled past and reductive associations should the term be phased out entirely? Islam the cooking teacher thinks we should move away from it. She advises chefs and home cooks to instead “take up space—tell your stories. It’s imperative to talk about where specific culinary techniques and cuisines originate to give credit and respect to the cultures they derive from.” With her upcoming The Diaspora Cookbook Javeri Kadri hopes to introduce readers to hyperlocal cuisines from places like the hills of Kerala to help them understand the nuances of tastes from across the subcontinent.

""The power of milk baby that's what that is!""

And that's the power of sponsorships.

Eagan-based Version1 an e-sports organization has partnered with the Midwest Dairy Association and other food brands as more companies tap into the growing influence of professional gaming.

""It's harder to reach a Gen Z audience through traditional media than it might have been just a few years ago and the e-sports space offers access to that young demographic"" said Brett Diamond chief operating officer of Version1.

Special to the Star Tribune Video (00:26)

Long the domain of energy drinks snacks and fast food e-sports have started attracting a wider range of food companies and categories in recent years.

Tyson Foods is sponsoring the Esports Awards this year and Bush's Beans is backing a college Rocket League tournament hosted by Version1 this fall.

""What was the core gamer audience a few years ago teenagers are now adults or young adults starting families or thinking about healthy eating and lifestyle choices"" Diamond said. ""At the end of the day you want something that's going to authentically engage with the audience they're trying to reach.""

The national Undeniably Dairy logo adorned the jerseys of the Version1 Rocket League team as they posted a top-eight finish at the world championship tournament in Texas this month. Tickets for the arena sold out almost immediately and streams were watched by hundreds of thousands of people.

""It's a massive market and reach"" said Eir Garcia Silva vice president for dairy experience youth at Midwest Dairy. ""This is a completely new area for us. Leaning on our partners we're working with they know the audience and we've given them the flexibility to do whatever.""

Beyond the surprising ""power of milk"" and other livestream callouts Version1 has a ""Cooking with Comm"" series hosted by one of its players and sponsored by Undeniably Dairy.

""We're keeping dairy top of mind and seeing it talked about in relevant ways making it fun and engaging"" Garcia Silva said.

Snack foods still have a healthy appetite for gamers and Pagoda egg rolls — owned by Minnesota-based Schwan's Co. — is partnering with Version1 after a successful debut in the e-sports world last year.

""We had a #PutTheEggRollsIn campaign with gamers on Twitch"" said Megan Elliott senior marketing manager at Schwan's. ""That activation generated 20 million content views and a 500% increase in traffic to our website.""

Pagoda is mainly working with Version1's content creators who make videos outside of live game streams.

""It's such a unique way to spark interest with consumers and get in front of them in a way they're engaged"" Elliott said. ""It's all so new so we're really just trying to learn and connect with consumers see what works see what doesn't.""

Some of the country's largest food and beverage brands — such as Mountain Dew Coca-Cola Kellogg's and McDonald's — have established a path other brands are following.

Golden Valley-based General Mills has had its Totino's frozen pizzas and rolls in the e-sports world for years including jersey and tournament sponsorships and game promotions on its products.

The brand recently unveiled a buffalo chicken flavor in partnership with the L.A.-based e-sports group FaZe Clan.

Version1 owned by the Minnesota Vikings' Wilf family and investor Gary Vaynerchuk has an 11000-square-foot headquarters and training facility in Eagan next to the Vikings' TCO Performance Center.

Teams include Minnesota Røkkr in the Call of Duty League Version1 in Rocket League and Version1 and VersionX in Valorant.

Diamond said that in the next few years the e-sports market and audience will mature and more brands will be lining up to reach them.

""It's the perfect platform for streaming services for how a younger audience is consuming content"" he said. ""That younger audience as they get older have more buying power and clout in the marketplace."""

The Federal Reserve System is the central bank of the United States.

It performs five general functions to promote the effective operation of the U.S. economy and more generally the public interest. The Federal Reserve

Read more in the 11th edition of Federal Reserve System The Fed Explained.

The Decentralized System Structure and Its Philosophy

In establishing the Federal Reserve System the United States was divided geographically into 12 Districts each with a separately incorporated Reserve Bank. District boundaries were based on prevailing trade regions that existed in 1913 and related economic considerations so they do not necessarily coincide with state lines.

Twelve Federal Reserve Districts operate independently but with supervision Federal Reserve District boundaries are based on economic considerations; the Districts operate independently but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.

As originally envisioned each of the 12 Reserve Banks was intended to operate independently from the other Reserve Banks. Variation was expected in discount rates--the interest rate that commercial banks were charged for borrowing funds from a Reserve Bank. The setting of a separately determined discount rate appropriate to each District was considered the most important tool of monetary policy at that time. The concept of national economic policymaking was not well developed and the impact of open market operations--purchases and sales of U.S. government securities--on policymaking was less significant.

As the nation's economy became more integrated and more complex through advances in technology communications transportation and financial services the effective conduct of monetary policy began to require increased collaboration and coordination throughout the System. This was accomplished in part through revisions to the Federal Reserve Act in 1933 and 1935 that together created the modern-day Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).

The Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 (Monetary Control Act) introduced an even greater degree of coordination among Reserve Banks with respect to the pricing of financial services offered to depository institutions. There has also been a trend among Reserve Banks to centralize or consolidate many of their financial services and support functions and to standardize others. Reserve Banks have become more efficient by entering into intra-System service agreements that allocate responsibilities for services and functions that are national in scope among each of the 12 Reserve Banks.

The U.S. Approach to Central Banking

The framers of the Federal Reserve Act purposely rejected the concept of a single central bank. Instead they provided for a central banking ""system"" with three salient features: (1) a central governing Board (2) a decentralized operating structure of 12 Reserve Banks and (3) a combination of public and private characteristics.

Although parts of the Federal Reserve System share some characteristics with private-sector entities the Federal Reserve was established to serve the public interest.

There are three key entities in the Federal Reserve System: the Board of Governors the Federal Reserve Banks (Reserve Banks) and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The Board of Governors an agency of the federal government that reports to and is directly accountable to Congress provides general guidance for the System and oversees the 12 Reserve Banks.

Within the System certain responsibilities are shared between the Board of Governors in Washington D.C. whose members are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate and the Federal Reserve Banks and Branches which constitute the System's operating presence around the country. While the Federal Reserve has frequent communication with executive branch and congressional officials its decisions are made independently.

The Three Key Federal Reserve Entities

The Federal Reserve Board of Governors (Board of Governors) the Federal Reserve Banks (Reserve Banks) and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) make decisions that help promote the health of the U.S. economy and the stability of the U.S. financial system.

Three key entities serving the public interest The framers of the Federal Reserve Act developed a central banking system that would broadly represent the public interest.

Other Significant Entities Contributing to Federal Reserve Functions

Two other groups play important roles in the Federal Reserve System's core functions:

depository institutions--banks thrifts and credit unions; and Federal Reserve System advisory committees which make recommendations to the Board of Governors and to the Reserve Banks regarding the System's responsibilities.

Depository Institutions

Depository institutions offer transaction or checking accounts to the public and may maintain accounts of their own at their local Federal Reserve Banks. Depository institutions are required to meet reserve requirements--that is to keep a certain amount of cash on hand or in an account at a Reserve Bank based on the total balances in the checking accounts they hold.

Depository institutions that have higher balances in their Reserve Bank account than they need to meet reserve requirements may lend to other depository institutions that need those funds to satisfy their own reserve requirements. This rate influences interest rates asset prices and wealth exchange rates and thereby aggregate demand in the economy. The FOMC sets a target for the federal funds rate at its meetings and authorizes actions called open market operations to achieve that target.

Advisory Councils

Five advisory councils assist and advise the Board on matters of public policy.

Federal Advisory Council (FAC). This council established by the Federal Reserve Act comprises 12 representatives of the banking industry. The FAC ordinarily meets with the Board four times a year as required by law. Annually each Reserve Bank chooses one person to represent its District on the FAC. FAC members customarily serve three one-year terms and elect their own officers. Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council (CDIAC). The CDIAC was originally established by the Board of Governors to obtain information and views from thrift institutions (savings and loan institutions and mutual savings banks) and credit unions. More recently its membership has expanded to include community banks. Like the FAC the CDIAC provides the Board of Governors with firsthand insight and information about the economy lending conditions and other issues. Model Validation Council. This council was established by the Board of Governors in 2012 to provide expert and independent advice on its process to rigorously assess the models used in stress tests of banking institutions. Stress tests are required under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The council is intended to improve the quality of stress tests and thereby strengthen confidence in the stress-testing program. Community Advisory Council (CAC). This council was formed by the Federal Reserve Board in 2015 to offer diverse perspectives on the economic circumstances and financial services needs of consumers and communities with a particular focus on the concerns of low- and moderate-income populations. The CAC complements the FAC and CDIAC whose members represent depository institutions. The CAC meets semiannually with members of the Board of Governors. The 15 CAC members serve staggered three-year terms and are selected by the Board through a public nomination process. Insurance Policy Advisory Committee (IPAC). This council was established at the Board of Governors in 2018 by section 211(b) of the Economic Growth Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act. The IPAC provides information advice and recommendations to the Board on international insurance capital standards and other insurance issues.

Federal Reserve Banks also have their own advisory committees. Perhaps the most important of these are committees that advise the Banks on agricultural small business and labor matters. The Federal Reserve Board solicits the views of each of these committees biannually.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtZXJpY2FuYmFua2VyLmNvbS9uZXdzL3NtYmNzLXUtcy1iYW5rLXRvLWxhdW5jaC1kaWdpdGFsLWplbml1cy1icmFuZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SMBC's U.S. bank to launch digital 'Jenius' brand,"To strengthen its U.S. presence the Japanese banking giant Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. plans to launch a digital consumer banking unit called Jenius Bank that will operate as a division of SMBC's Los Angeles-based subsidiary the $4.9 billion-asset Manufacturers Bank.

SMBC expects to roll out Jenius in the coming months with a personal loan product then follow with savings and checking within the unit's first year of operation.

The move is a departure for Manufacturers Bank. Founded 1962 and acquired by Tokyo-based Mitsui Bank in 1981 Manufacturers has built a reputation as a commercial-focused lender.

Manufacturers came under its present ownership structure in 2001 when Mitsui Bank merged with Sumitomo Bank to create SMBC.

""With the launch of Jenius Bank we have the rare opportunity to build exceptional products from scratch that uniquely meet the needs of today's digitally native consumers who need and expect more"" Manufacturers Bank Chairman and CEO Kazuhisa Miyagawa said in a press release Wednesday.

According to Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. statistics commercial-and-industrial loans accounted for 45% of Manufacturers' $2.4 billion loan portfolio on June 30. The company also does substantial business in multifamily and commercial real estate lending.

Mortgages home equity lines of credit and consumer loans amounted to $19 million.

""Jenius Bank will be a leader in data and technology using information to provide personalized insights for consumers seeking to make the most of their money not just manage it"" John Rosenfeld president of Jenius Bank said in the press release.

Jenius plans to have a nationwide footprint. It will limit expenses as it unfolds its business plan with a digital-first strategy. This will minimize paper and manual processing as well as eliminate the need for physical branches.

""Our target customers don't want these things and the resulting efficiency will allow us to provide more value back to them"" Rosenfeld said.

Jenius will still maintain a 24/7 call center according to Rosenfeld.

""The new digital consumer banking business is another tangible example of SMBC Group's focus and commitment to further enhancing its customer service"" Jun Ohta president and group chief executive of SMBC said in the press release.

Capt. Micah Robbins company commander of the Liberty (Mo.) Army Recruiting Company and Jodi Vickery Armed Forces Bank director of military consumer lending signed a memorandum of agreement to recognize Armed Forces Bank/Academy Bank as a partner in the U.S. Army Partnership for Your Success (PaYS) Program during a ceremony Aug. 18 at Armed Forces Bank on Fort Leavenworth.

The PaYS Program guarantees service members transitioning into civilian careers an interview with national business partners such as Armed Forces Bank. The program enters participants into a database in which they can monitor employment opportunities with up to five participating partners. Upon application service members can continue to network with the partner to find potential positions valuable to themselves and PaYS partners. PaYS began in 2000 as an enlistment incentive and scaled to service Reservists cadets and the National Guard.

During his remarks Robbins welcomed those in attendance and said it was an honor to be present for the signing. He said recruiting those in uniform and service members seeking civilian careers are challenging; the partnership sets a solution in motion.

“With the privilege comes opportunity. (In this) event today we’re stamping a sense of approval on what we see as being an enduring workforce partnership and relationship moving forward” Robbins said.

He said he believes the partnership closes a resource gap between Armed Forces Bank and the military while translating skills between organizations for service members.

Vickery also thanked those in attendance and the staff at Armed Forces Bank for their efforts in forging the partnership and ceremony.

“Becoming a PaYS partner is a meaningful way that Armed Forces Bank and our sister bank Academy Bank can act on our deep commitment to supporting the men and women of the military.” Vickery said.

She said the company has valued finding opportunities to support service members and their families since its inception in 1907. Vickery said military-affiliated employees comprise about 85 percent of personnel at Armed Forces Bank retail branches.

“We know — and first-hand value — the strength of character the leadership values the work ethic and the many other intangible elements that a service member can bring to the table to offer a civilian employer” Vickery said. “These characteristics add significant value to our organization and so the opportunity today to solidify that becoming a PaYS partner is just a natural next step for us to take.”

She said she understands the importance of the PaYS program as the spouse of a retired service member who has experienced the challenges of hiring during a transition out of the military. She said Armed Forces Bank can quickly hire high caliber valuable employees by understanding a soldier’s military experience and the translation of skills learned in occupational specialties. She said the bank offers a series of occupations to continue the professional development of service members as it has done in the past through industry training and spouses’ programs.

“We couldn’t be more pleased today to officially add this PaYS partnership with the U.S. Army to these things and other ways we engage in support of the community that we are just privileged to serve on a day-in and day-out basis. We look forward to interviewing mentoring and hiring future candidates at both of our banks that will no doubt be sent our way through the PaYS program.”

Teresa Ascencio chief people officer at Academy Bank shared her enthusiasm for the opportunity to hire service members transitioning into civilian careers through the program. She compared the skills shared by bankers and soldiers specifically a heart for service.

Morgan BAML and Morgan Stanley pay in the U.S.,"Following a record 2021 Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Morgan Stanley Bank of America and Citi have endured a tougher start to the year as a market downturn has hit deal volumes. In the six months to June 30 the big five posted an average 43% drop in investment banking division revenues.

That will mean lower bonuses for 2022 but all have hiked salaries considerably for junior talent which continues to be in demand. In particular associates have benefitted from a big uplift in pay over the last 18 months.

We’ve compiled the latest average salary data for each of these firms and it reveals some variation. JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs remain the banks to beat in the investment banking league tables but they lag their rivals in terms of pay according to Wall Street Oasis (WSO) the forum website.

Banks don't provide a breakdown of compensation according to seniority but WSO says JPMorgan paid its analysts and vice presidents lower than the rest of the Street. Similarly JPMorgan is near the bottom of the pack when it comes to associate pay.

According to WSO Goldman Sachs is middle of the pack. It pays its analysts an average salary of $92k and its VPs earn $232k less than Bank of America and Morgan Stanley. Its associates earn less than the rest of its big rivals according to WSO. Of course this could be due to a skewed data set.

WSO says Citi pays its analysts an average salary of $96k more than anyone else on the street. It also pays its associates an average of $169k putting it in second place behind Morgan Stanley

Morgan Stanley pays its associates $175k according to WSO. It also looks after its vice presidents (VPs). In previous years the bank was bottom when it came to pay for this cohort but it now pays them an average salary of $274k almost on a par with Bank of America which is the most generous with $275k.

Bank of America paid its new starters the most last year but this year it’s been relegated to second spot by arch-rival Citi according to WSO. It pays its analysts an average salary of $94k and its associates $168k.

Data is hard to come by for managing directors (MDs). However fixed salaries for MDs start at around $500k. The total package of salary plus bonus can be multiples of that once bonuses are included. The size of the bonus depends on a number of things – the total revenue your team brought in as well as your own contribution to the top line...

Although those are the average numbers recruitment and banking sources say a tight labour has pushed base salaries higher than WSO suggests with all five big US banks paying $110k salaries to analysts and $175k to associates. They say that directors at Goldman and Morgan Stanley earn $250k while Bank of America Citi and JPMorgan pay $275k.

Campaigners in Ukraine said these institutions must immediately end such investments to limit the funding of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and to avoid climate breakdown.

Carbon bombs are fossil-fuel extraction projects identified by researchers to contain at least 1bn tonnes of climate-heating CO 2  triple the UK’s annual emissions. Russia is a hotspot with 40 carbon bombs 19 of them operated or developed by Russian companies backed by foreign finance. The companies are Gazprom Novatek Lukoil Rosneft oil company and Tatneft.

The database produced by the Leave it in the Ground Initiative (Lingo) found more than 400 foreign financial institutions had provided $130bn (£109bn) of support to the Russian companies – $52bn in investment and $84bn in credit. The data was released on Wednesday Ukraine’s independence day and six months since the start of the Russian invasion.

Financial institutions in the US hold almost half the foreign investment in Russian carbon bomb companies with 154 institutions holding $23.6bn. The largest combination of investment and credit – $10bn – was provided by JPMorgan Chase which other analyses have also identified as a leading funder of fossil fuels.

The biggest single investment in the Russian carbon bomb companies was the $15.3bn in Rosneft held by the Qatar Investment Authority Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund.

The UK was third in the list of investing nations with 32 financial institutions holding $2.5bn in investments. HSBC had the largest investment and credit total at $308m. Financial groups in Japan Norway Switzerland and the Netherlands also held significant investments while Chinese and Italian institutions provided $45bn in credit between them.

“Putin’s war is funded through money from fossil fuels and these fossil fuels are causing climate breakdown as we speak” said Svitlana Romanko director of the Ukrainian NGO Razom We Stand which is calling for an immediate end to all foreign investment in Russian fossil fuel companies and a permanent embargo on Russian oil gas and coal. “Investing in Russian carbon bombs is the worst thing you can do today.”

Kjell Kühne at Lingo said: “This [war] has made really clear that when you don’t care who you’re doing business with it does translate into human suffering and lives lost. It’s also clear we should not be investing in new fossil fuel projects as the International Energy Agency has confirmed. Anybody involved in these projects should be really questioning what they’re doing.”

The Lingo researchers said some financial institutions may have reduced their support for the Russian companies since the war started but that many seemed to have adopted a wait-and-see approach. The researchers hope the database will enable campaigners to challenge the 400 institutions over their investments.

The foreign financial support is largely for big oil and gas projects in Russia including in Siberia and the Arctic. Coal projects are mainly supported by domestic investors the researchers said. The database only includes financial support for the Russian fossil fuel companies and not for foreign oil and gas companies that work in Russia or the services companies that support them.

In May the Guardian revealed that world’s biggest fossil fuel firms were quietly planning huge oil and gas projects that would drive the climate past internationally agreed temperature limits with catastrophic global impacts. The plans included 195 carbon bombs identified by Kühne and his colleagues 60% of which have already started pumping. “We have identified the carbon bombs now we have to defuse them” he said.

Addressing passenger and driver safety.,"It’s easy to worry about your safety while using a rideshare app especially if it’s late at night and you’re a lone passenger. If you're worried about personal or vehicular safety you’re definitely not alone.

Uber made news in July 2022 after being sued for 550 sexual assault and attack claims leaving many wondering how safe using the app for transportation actually is.

In a statement to USA TODAY Uber said it takes “every single report seriously.""

“There is nothing more important than safety which is why Uber has built new safety features established survivor-centric policies and been more transparent about serious incidents” the statement said. “While we can’t comment on pending litigation we will continue to keep safety at the heart of our work.”

Is Uber safe?

Uber’s 2019-2020 Safety Report states that 99.9% of all Uber rides are completed without incident. The 78-page report stated Uber dealt with 3824 incidents of severe sexual assault and misconduct in the U.S. including that 20 people were killed in assaults.

The company reported 141 incidents of rape and 998 incidents of sexual assault in 2020 according to NBC News.

Additionally the report states about one in 90 million trips resulted in passengers dying in fatal car crashes. With a rate of 0.62 Uber-related motor vehicle fatalities per 100 million Uber-related vehicle miles traveled Uber had about one-half the death rate of the entire U.S. which was 1.22 motor vehicle fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled according to the report. This means using Uber to get from point A to point B could be relatively safer than driving yourself with regard to motor vehicle deaths.

Is Uber safe for women?

While people of all genders can be victims of sexual assault women have reason to be particularly worried about attacks. The Rape Abuse & Incest National Network reports that 90 percent of adult rape victims are female as well as 82 percent of juvenile rape victims.

According to an Alarms.org women’s safety report in 2020 Uber and Lyft are safer for women than taxis professional car services and public transportation. Still that doesn’t mean rideshare transportation always happens without incident.

Even though Uber requires background checks and vets its drivers each year plenty of people feel unsafe in an Uber. The Alarms.org report states 23% of women surveyed say they reported uncomfortable driver behavior to Uber. Lyft came in slightly lower with 15% of women surveyed saying they had reported a driver’s behavior to Lyft.

Is Uber safe for drivers?

Uber’s 2019-2020 Safety Report actually shows fewer driver fatalities in motor vehicle accidents than passenger deaths with one driver fatality reported for every 140 million trips.

According to the report riders were the accused party in 43% of the company’s sexual assault claims so drivers like passengers should also follow safety best practices.

How to be safe in an Uber

According to the Uber Car Accident Law practice of attorneys Neufeld Kleinberg and Pinkiert you can follow these 14 tips to be safe as an Uber passenger:

You can sign up here to receive it weekdays.

Uber and some transportation experts once predicted that getting a ride with the tap of an app would help reduce traffic and increase riders’ use of public transportation.

Instead the opposite happened.

I mentioned this in a recent newsletter. I wanted to go a little deeper today into what went wrong with the promise of on-demand rides and what we could learn from it. How can we believe that technology will help solve big problems if Uber’s great promise didn’t pan out?

Here’s what more research is finding: In the past few years on-demand ride services have been a major factor in increased traffic in U.S. cities particularly in the downtowns of big cities. And most research is showing that the ride services have also been a significant reason for declining ridership of public transportation especially buses.

Uber and Lyft have said that people driving themselves are the biggest sources of traffic. That is true but it doesn’t explain the surge in traffic that the services have added to cities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS91YmVyLWVhdHMtZHJpdmVyLXNheXMtaGFuZGN1ZmZlZC1jb3BzLWRlbGl2ZXJpbmctc2Nob29sLXZpcmFsLXRpa3Rvay0xNzM3MDI50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber Eats Driver Says He Was Handcuffed by Cops While Delivering to School,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.newsweek.com/uber-eats-driver-says-handcuffed-cops-delivering-school-viral-tiktok-1737029 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS91YmVyLWVhdHMtZHJpdmVyLXNheXMtaGFuZGN1ZmZlZC1jb3BzLWRlbGl2ZXJpbmctc2Nob29sLXZpcmFsLXRpa3Rvay0xNzM3MDI50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

While celebrating her beauty brand’s latest milestone Kylie Jenner had her entire family by her side.

Jenner 25 was photographed rocking an unbuttoned white shirtdress on her way to the Ulta Beauty party in Los Angeles on Wednesday August 24. The beauty mogul who completed her look with sunglasses and a sequin clutch was joined by 4-year-old daughter Stormi. The little one matched her mom with a silver top and skirt outfit. Jenner’s daughter also looked adorable with her own pair of sunglasses and small purse.

While at the event Kris Jenner Kim Kardashian Khloé Kardashian Kourtney Kardashian and Kendall Jenner all made appearances to support their family member. Khloé 38 and Kris 66 both showed off the hot pink trend with stunning pantsuits. Meanwhile Kim 41 and Kourtney 43 opted for an edgy black theme with their ensembles. Kendall 26 for her part stood out with a sleek dress that included a print in the front.

The famous family’s outing came as Kylie rang in her latest release of Kylie Cosmetics’ Kylie Lip Kits at Ulta Beauty. The Life of Kylie alum recently changed up the design of her iconic makeup brand amid a company makeover.

“The NEW @kyliecosmetics is officially launching on July 15 on KylieCosmetics.com! Everything is clean and vegan and I can’t wait for you guys to try these new formulas” she wrote via Instagram in July 2021. “I’m so thankful to all of you who have been on this journey with me and can’t wait to take you into the new chapter of Kylie Cosmetics.”

At the time Kylie noted that her brand would be expanding globally with products being sold in Douglas Cosmetics Nocibé Harrods Beauty Selfridges Mecca Beauty Ulta Nordstrom Gold Apple Boots UK and Shopper’s Drug Mart.

After launching Kylie Cosmetics at the age of 17 in 2014 the reality star made a name for herself in the beauty industry. In November 2019 Kylie sold a 51 percent stake of her cosmetics and skincare businesses to Coty.

According to the California native her daughter is next in line to take over her beauty empire — should Stormi be interested. “She has her own office where she gets all her business done” the Kylie Skin founder explained in a YouTube video in July 2021 adding that her first child “loves” to work.

She added: “Stormi is my legacy. I’m raising her to be smart and kind and driven. Maybe she will take over Kylie Cosmetics one day? Only if she wants to. Becoming a mom was the biggest change for me. I’ve grown so much as a person and I continue to grow every single day. I love learning and I’m trying to be the best person I can possibly be.”

Kylie who shares Stormi with Travis Scott expanded her family earlier this year with the birth of their baby boy. After their second child’s arrival in February the Keeping Up With the Kardashians alum announced that she and Scott 31 named their baby Wolf. They later clarified that they changed their son’s name to a new moniker that they have yet to reveal.

“FYI our son’s name isn’t Wolf anymore” the mom of two wrote via Instagram Story in March. “We just really didn’t feel like it was him. Just wanted to share because I keep seeing Wolf everywhere.”

Global Rail Transportation Market to Reach $561.7 Billion by 2026

The global market for Rail Transportation estimated at US$457 Billion in the year 2022 is projected to reach a revised size of US$561.7 Billion by 2026 growing at a CAGR of 4.7% over the analysis period.

Railway industry investments are driving significant technological advancements and innovation such as connected solutions to improve scheduling service safety security accessibility profitable operations and capacity planning for the future while indicating critical role of railways in passenger and freight transportation in the coming years.

Infrastructure spending on new and existing railway networks continues to escalate across the world because of various reasons. Railways represent the most environmental-friendly land transport mode with much lower energy consumption and lesser CO2 emissions per tonne-kilometer than roadways or waterways.

Personal as well as freight transportation needs of world population is growing in tandem with increase in business and commercial activity while putting additional pressure on existing transportation networks including roadways aerial and sea routes besides railways.

The scenario is forcing the governments to enhance their transportation networks across the board through installation of new projects and expansion of existing infrastructure. Railway networks offering a plethora of benefits in passenger and freight transport continue to gain traction in government budgets on improving transport infrastructure.

Although the current scenario remains grim for railway sector outlook for 2021 and beyond however appears to be mostly optimistic. Anticipated resurgence in global economy and improvements in business and consumer confidence indices and revival in industrial activity would aid railway sector to bounce back into growth trajectory in 2021.

Renewed activity in mining & minerals iron & steel coal and petroleum sectors especially in China India the US and the Middle East & Africa would push the demand for rail freight services.

Passenger one of the segments analyzed in the report is projected to grow at a 5.2% CAGR to reach US$316.4 Billion by the end of the analysis period.

After a thorough analysis of the business implications of the pandemic and its induced economic crisis growth in the Freight segment is readjusted to a revised 4.1% CAGR for the next 7-year period. This segment currently accounts for a 48.2% share of the global Rail Transportation market.

Because of the lockdowns and the resultant dysfunctional supply chains enterprise operations declined on a massive scale across major sectors including mining & minerals iron & steel oil & gas chemicals petrochemicals construction materials automobiles and electronics which eventually led to decreased demand for freight transportation volumes during the year.

Expected recovery in manufacturing automotive electrical/electronics and engineering and construction sectors would in particular enhance the demand for freight transportation.



The U.S. Market is Estimated at $105.4 Billion in 2022 While China is Forecast to Reach $95.6 Billion by 2026

The Rail Transportation market in the U.S. is estimated at US$105.4 Billion in the year 2022. The country currently accounts for a 23.25% share in the global market. China the world's second largest economy is forecast to reach an estimated market size of US$95.6 Billion in the year 2026 trailing a CAGR of 6.3% through the analysis period.

Among the other noteworthy geographic markets are Japan and Canada each forecast to grow at 3.4% and 4.5% respectively over the analysis period. Within Europe Germany is forecast to grow at approximately 3.7% CAGR while Rest of European market (as defined in the study) will reach US$101.7 Billion by the end of the analysis period.

In North America and Asia freight operations are generally longer than in Europe stop less frequently and the freight infrastructure facilitates for substantially heavier and longer trains that run economically. Steered by governmental emphasis on improving the connectivity and public transportation infrastructure in rural semi-urban and urban areas spending on new high speed trains mainline trains metro trains and freight trains increased considerably.

NASHVILLE Tenn. Aug. 24 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- LP Building Solutions (LP) a leading manufacturer of high-performance building products celebrated a landmark day in company history on Aug. 19 2022 with the grand opening of its new global headquarters in Nashville Tennessee.

The new headquarters which spans the top two floors—all 60000 square feet—of the Creative Office Building in Midtown's Broadwest development allows LP to further expand its corporate hybrid workplace model while upgrading its office environment.

Members of LP Building Solutions staff celebrate the opening of LP's new headquarters.

Founded 50 years ago in Portland Oregon LP relocated its headquarters to Nashville in 2004. Prior to its move to Broadwest the company was in downtown's central business district. In 2021 LP announced the move to the Broadwest complex to seek a more innovative collaborative and flexible office space. With more than 60 collaboration areas (conference rooms huddle rooms and more) the new state-of-the-art headquarters is designed to support a hybrid work environment that allows employees to determine where they work—whether remotely or in the office—based on their roles and responsibilities.

At the grand opening ceremony LP Chair and CEO Brad Southern welcomed employees to their new workplace and Senior Engineering Project Manager Danaillie Woodfine cut the ribbon to officially declare the facility open for business. They were joined by LP's executive team and more than 100 corporate employees.

""Today marks an important milestone in our history"" said Southern. ""Our new headquarters is a hub for innovation and collaboration—critical components of our continued success. We are happy to welcome employees to this new space and excited to see the fresh ideas that will inspire further LP accomplishments here.""

Located at 1610 West End Avenue Broadwest's Creative Office Building plaza and 2500-space parking garage completed construction earlier this year. The Class A building features 18-foot floor-to-ceiling windows a rooftop terrace a fitness center and an exterior plaza.

Inspired by the company's wood-based building materials the architectural and design theme of the new headquarters is ""never far from the tree"" and was constructed using LP products throughout. The office also features a 25-foot-wide 8-foot-tall hand-carved wooden mural originally commissioned over 30 years ago for the company's original headquarters in Portland.

The headquarters also features an LP Health & Wellness Center. This on-site clinic is for the exclusive use of employees and their family members. It provides primary care and wellness services such as immunizations annual health assessments and health coaching at little to no cost.

NHPR is republishing it in partnership with the Granite State News Collaborative.

A quality insurance auditor at the United Parcel Service facility in Londonderry says she was repeatedly sexually harassed by seven co-workers and was fired for reporting it to authorities according to a case that was moved to federal court last week.

In a complaint filed with the New Hampshire Human Rights Commission Paula Gambeski says the incidents began shortly after she was promoted in 2015. She says they ranged from texted penises being asked to expose her breasts sexual propositions physically grabbing her behind and shoving.

When she complained to her manager she alleges her complaints were dismissed — sometimes with sexual comments — and ignored says the filing. After filing her HRC complaint and an assault charge against her supervisor she was fired in April 2017 according to the complaint.

The charges first filed with the HRC in May 2017 were amended to include more details the following year and added UPS Supply Chain Solutions as the defendant. Such filings are normally not public until the commission issues a decision.

The HRC investigators found probable cause for sexual harassment but not for retaliation on May 25 of this year. A hearing was scheduled for February of next year. It was also heading to Superior Court but UPS attorneys from Littler Mendelson a firm in Portland Maine filed a motion to move the case U.S. District Court in Concord. A federal judge did so on Aug. 17 thereby making the complaint against its client public.

In its motion UPS denies the “claims in their entirety” but does not respond to specifics.

A call to the Littler firm was not returned but UPS did issue the following general statement in response to the suit: “One of UPS’s core values is people should be respected and protected in the workplace. The company does not tolerate comments or actions that are considered harassment or retaliatory. We offer our employees several ways to report and resolve issues with confidence and we respond promptly when concerns are brought to our attention.”

Gambeski is represented by Nancy Richards-Stower an attorney in Yarmouth Maine who would not talk about the allegations but about the lengthy time it takes for a harassed victim to get justice.

“The long and arduous legal process for the victim of harassment is made worse by a statute passed by an earlier [state] legislature which let the employer pull the case out of the HRC and slam it into state court” she said. “And if the employer is located outside of New Hampshire then it can shove it into federal court whether or not she has a lawyer or if she prefers the more private process of the Human Rights Commission.”

In January female employees of UPS in California filed a class action suit charging that the company has an “old boys club culture.” That suit alleges that women who are “outwardly feminine” are required to show their commitment to the company in ways other employees don’t have to. And in March a suit was filed by an employee in Texas who said that her supervisor harassed her by making sexual comments and inappropriately touching her.

UPS which reported more than $97 billion in revenue and  with profits of nearly $13 billion last year. It has 534000 employees of which 444000 are in the U.S.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndzd3Mub3JnL2VuL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjIvMDgvMjYvd2ZlbC1hMjYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,“It is 140 to 150 degrees in the back of those trucks”: UPS workers speak out about intense heat and other abuses at ...,"A UPS driver removing a package to deliver in August 2020 [Photo: US Department of Agriculture]

United Parcel Service (UPS) workers are angry over the deaths and hospitalizations from working conditions with no air conditioning or protection from the heat which has blanketed the United States throughout the summer.

According to a report published by NBC News based on interviews with over a dozen UPS workers “more workers seem to be getting sick and have been hospitalized because of the heat than ever before.”

While many workers experience increased instances of heat exhaustion dehydration and fatigue the report stated it was difficult to quantify the total number because such incidents are “generally under reported and only include in-patient hospitalizations.”

UPS made a record $12.9 billion profit in 2021 more than 10 times 2020’s reported $1.34 billion in profits. “The external environment is challenging due to the ongoing impacts of the pandemic labor tightness upstream supply chain jams and rising inflation” said UPS Chief Executive Officer Carol Tomé in an investors’ call last February reported the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

However “we are maniacal about controlling what we can control” gloated the executive alluding to the dictatorial regime running inside the company’s warehouses which includes unsafe working conditions increasing exploitation for ever-lower pay and days which sometimes last 14 hours.

In late June Esteban Chavez Jr. a 24-year-old delivery driver in Southern California collapsed and died while on deliveries. The New York Times reported on another fatality that occurred in 2021. Jose Rodriguez 23 was found dead from heat exhaustion at the end of his shift. His mother Jorja Rodriguez told the Times she had “sent her son to work that morning with a cooler full of water and energy drinks and told him to ‘take it easy.’” His body was found in the company lot.

“I called his name so many times thinking that if he would hear my voice he would wake up” she told the Times.

Such incidents have noticeably shaken many workers who have joined protests across the country in opposition to the corporate giant’s abuses.

“We just talked about the death of Esteban Chavez in California and the driver in bad condition on the Arizona videotape at this rally” said a worker outside a Brooklyn UPS facility to World Socialist Web Site reporters earlier this month. “[The Teamsters] say they are going to fight for A/C in the contract and if UPS doesn’t give it we will go on strike.”

A worker explained the strain of delivering in such high levels of heat. “I need to stop and cool off for a half an hour somewhere to make it through the day. I have to do that to survive.”

“There are no more drivers being hospitalized like last week as far as I know but I’m sure they are covering it up” said another who asked not to be named for fear of company retaliation. “I got dizzy at the end of the day Friday. The back of the truck with packages is like an oven.

“When you are carrying food products the smell of the toxins from the food like pesticides with the fruit is cooked out and the smell is horrible and overwhelming. We deliver live packages of insects and fish. They load packages into the truck until it is stuffed and the live packages have their survival jeopardized.”

According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) UPS has had at least 270 workers sickened by heat exhaustion. Many were hospitalized. This hazard has been made worse by the company which has invaded workers’ privacy and autonomy in violation of contractual requirements.

“The trucks are hot. UPS’s answer is to take a ‘Cool Solution.’ That means take a break here and there for 10 minutes” said another worker at the Brooklyn rally speaking to the WSWS. “It is 140 to 150 degrees in the back of those trucks. [They want you to ] take a little exhaust fan like they hand out and all it does is blow the hot air around.”

In early August supporters of the Teamsters for a Democratic Union (TDU) an opposition caucus which is supporting the present Teamsters leadership posted pictures of UPS’s in-vehicle temperature gauges. The readings (pictured) said that the interior of their delivery trucks were sometimes higher than 130 degrees.

The company has denied allegations that it is placing its employees in harm’s way. “The health and safety of our employees is our highest priority” stated a public statement cited by the New York Times.

Elsewhere the company has touted its “Cool Solutions” program which includes “providing additional water ice electrolyte replacement beverages and fruits with high water content” as well as providing heat-dispersing clothing.

“Instead of giving us better solutions UPS gives us ‘Cool Solutions’” said a worker in Brooklyn regarding management’s inefficient response to the heat hazard. “They spent $2 million on ‘Cool Solutions.’ If you take 10 minutes breaks from the sun you compromise your rate. Then they punish you for your breaks.”

Other workers emphasized this point.

“I will tell you how it works” said another worker in Brooklyn. “The safety committee which is the company’s safety committee tells you that if you get overheated and feel bad you take stops to go into cool areas and drink cooling liquids. But you still only have your scheduled one hour off for lunch. So when you do need to stop and cool off in a cool area with cool drinks the supervisors are all over you for ‘stealing time from the company.’”

This happens even though “you are doing what the safety committee said but because the union and shop stewards say nothing to defend you you get written up and punished” said a worker from Pennsylvania. “There’s no water for workers the company constantly says ‘oh we just ran out of water’” he continued.

The sham character of the company’s “safety” program was further evidenced earlier this month when a worker reported they had been reprimanded for stopping to take a sip of water.

Other workers denounced the company’s surveillance of its workforce. “They just want to spend more on surveillance equipment…They write you up for anything. Then you have to talk to the boss and after enough of those they can fire you. That is the way they move up in management.”

“They will follow you in their personal car and film you to see if you are doing anything that possibly violates their rule book. That happens a lot. What is it going to take? 30 40 or 100 heatstroke incidents or deaths?”

In 2021 the company began installing Lyxt Drive-Cam cameras in delivery trucks. According to a post on the TDU’s blog site while such devices “can be set to only record when they are triggered by an incident like swerving or sudden braking” they “can also be set up to continuously record and even live-stream video and audio footage from outside and inside the truck.”

Under conditions where workers are forced to the breaking point during their shifts this added invasion of privacy can lead to massive abuses. “All the workers DHL (delivery services) UPS Amazon these companies expect you to just piss in a bottle because you don’t have time” said the worker from Pennsylvania.

“Some girls will literally pee in a bag the plastic bag that they give you to wear when it’s raining. Then they will throw it away at a trash can whenever they can. We’ve had people s—- in a bag to just not drive 10 mins out to get to a bathroom.”

The Teamsters have tried to diffuse the mounting outrage by hosting a number of public rallies across the country to protest these conditions in addition to other posturing.

Earlier in August Teamsters president Sean O’Brien sent a public statement to UPS demanding “safety plans and managerial policies” from the company as well as information on “which UPS facilities are not being properly equipped by the company and why.”

Despite O’Brien’s references to “UPS executives… inside their air-conditioned C-suite offices” the Teamsters have no strategy to resist the company’s abuses.

An article published in Business Journal (“6 Issues That Could Push UPS Teamsters To Strike”) quotes the Teamsters boss. According to O’Brien even if anger is high over the 2018 UPS contract which was forced through on a technicality despite a majority “no” vote it will be “difficult” to “walk backwards” i.e. to undo the concessions of the illegitimate contract.

“Excessive overtime” one of the Teamsters’ “6 issues” is called a “byproduct of Saturday service.” That is it was a byproduct of the concessionary contract which UPS and the Teamsters forced down members’ throats. “We’re open to finding a solution to the seven-day week delivery because what (sic) the competition is doing” conceded O’Brien mildly criticizing the present situation is “not working.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdXBzLWRyaXZlci1oZWF0LWV4aGF1c3Rpb24tZXItbm8tYWMtaW4tdHJ1Y2tzLTIwMjItONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UPS Driver: Extreme Heat in Truck Sent Me to Emergency Room 3 Times,"A United Parcel Service (UPS) truck delivers boxes in Manhattan on April 26 2022 in New York City.

Many UPS drivers are working in sweltering conditions in trucks with no fans or A/C this summer.

Insider spoke to a UPS driver who got heat exhaustion multiple times and even had to go to the ER.

This is their story as told to writer Jenny Powers.

In a statement to Insider a UPS spokesperson said: ""The health and safety of our employees is our highest priority."" The full statement is published below.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with a UPS driver. He spoke on condition of anonymity to protect his job but his employment has been verified by Insider and his story has been corroborated by another UPS employee and via documentation. The following has been edited for length and clarity.



Not a day has gone by this summer where someone hasn't turned to me and said ""Is it true you don't have air conditioning in your truck?"" I wish I had a different answer than ""Yes"" for my own sake but sadly it's the truth.

It's not an isolated issue either as the bulk of UPS drivers don't have A/C or even a fan in their vehicles.

As temperatures continued to rise this summer so did the public outcry regarding our less-than-ideal working conditions. UPS responded by recently issuing a statement claiming they train drivers to work in the heat but I wouldn't call posting flyers and handouts offering basic tips such as ""Stay hydrated"" or ""Drink more water than usual"" as training. I'd call them what they are — obvious reminders.

Some of these tips which fall under the corporate heading of 'Cool Solutions' are blatantly contradictory anyway

For example suggesting we ""wear lightweight light-colored clothing"" when our issued uniforms are dark brown doesn't even make sense. It's not as if we have a choice!

I've played sports most of my life so I know how to stay hydrated. Every day I fill a large cooler with bottles of frozen water and Gatorade along with Isagenix Hydrate. If I run out during my shift I always stop to get more. I also keep my driver and passenger roller doors open at all times to take advantage of the breeze and even wear shorts in the winter.

But that's not always enough.

Some afternoons I've been known to march myself into the walk-in beer cooler at the local grocery store and spend about 20 minutes inside enjoying the arctic air before returning to my route. Now that's a ""Cool Solution"" if you ask me!

Still despite all my best efforts I've suffered from heat exhaustion on 3 separate occasions this summer alone

Ask any UPS driver and they'll tell you ""dropping route"" which means returning to base before you've made all your drops is greatly frowned upon by management and doing so without permission could result in being disciplined with job abandonment sabotage or insubordination. However if it's a choice between my health and making the company's numbers for the day that's a no-brainer right there. I'm choosing me every time.

The first time the heat got to me I was lugging a very heavy package uphill when I started to get dizzy. Feeling light-headed I grew concerned about getting back behind the wheel so I called a supervisor.

Within 20 minutes he came to get me and bring me back to our facility.







The second time I wasn't as lucky. After once again experiencing dizziness and lightheadedness I messaged management and said I needed help as soon as possible and was too sick to finish my route.

I was met with radio silence

Finally six minutes later I sent another message letting them know I was going to call 911.

That got their attention.

They responded they were sending help but more than 15 minutes later help still wasn't on the way.

Finally close to an hour later a supervisor arrived to retrieve my truck while another drove me back to the building.

I probably should have gone to the ER but between the A/C pumping in my supervisor's car and the Gatorade I drank on the way back to the center I began feeling better — so I didn't go.

The most recent time I felt sick I didn't bother messaging management

Instead I stopped in the middle of my route and drove back to the building where we called 911. I was taken to the local hospital by ambulance.

I was diagnosed with dehydration and the doctor on call recommended light duty and told me not to drive for two days to allow time for me to fully recover. The next day when I returned to work one of the supervisors gave me pushback and questioned the doctor's orders about light duty. As if I didn't already feel bad enough!

I wound up calling the company's ethics hotline and filing a complaint against him.

The hotline which is run by a third party is supposed to follow through with an investigation based on the claim but I haven't heard a peep beyond them telling me they received my claim and that was months ago.

This heat is a major problem for drivers all over the country

The now-viral video capturing the UPS driver collapsing on a customer's porch last month in Arizona has been a real wake-up call in terms of revealing the harsh realities we as drivers face working day in and day out in this oppressive heat.

But that was just the beginning.

Since that incident a 24-year-old driver died after being found unconscious in his truck and while it hasn't been confirmed his family suspects it was heat-related.

It's a pretty sad state of affairs to say the least but I guess if any good is to come out of all this it's that there is finally some light being shed on our unsafe working conditions for the world to see. All of these instances provide lots of ammunition for the union as we prepare to negotiate our next contract which expires July 31 2023.

Management says their priority is driver safety so why are they prioritizing the installation of interior and exterior cameras in our trucks over the installation of A/C or fans? Shouldn't proper ventilation in our trucks top the list?

Instead we're forced to breathe stale air in routinely unsafe temperatures especially in the back of our trucks.

It's not uncommon for temperature readings to rise as high as 120 to 130 degrees

I wish the television show ""Undercover Boss"" would invite UPS management on for an episode so they would be forced to dress up in Browns — what we call our uniforms — and come out here and experience for themselves what we deal with each and every day in this weather.

I took this job six years ago for the benefits and the pension which are terrific and allow me to support myself my wife and my kids. That's what keeps me here.

Our medical benefits are so robust that when we go to the emergency room I don't have to pay a dime but the way things are going this summer I'm seeing the inside of doctor's offices and emergency rooms more than I'd like to lately whether it's covered or not.

Frankly I think UPS should forget about asking customers ""What can Brown do for you?"" and instead try asking its drivers the same question.

In a statement to Insider Matthew O'Connor director of media relations at UPS said: The health and safety of our employees is our highest priority. In preparing for this summer's heat wave we instituted several new steps to support employee safety and comfort on the job including increasing the heat-related PPE we provide. As part of this effort to support our drivers we are providing additional water ice electrolyte replacement beverages and fruits with high water content. Along with this we launched the following action plans as summer started: distributing 260000 new uniforms with wicking dry-fit shirts and performance fabric shorts making more than 125000 cooling towels available and accelerating the installation of fans in UPS vehicles across the country.

UPS trains employees to work safely throughout the year focusing on the importance of proper rest hydration nutrition and other good health practices. We have meetings with our employees all year round and when warranted remind them of forecasted temperatures signs and symptoms of heat illness and to be aware of their own health conditions. We also send reminders to our employees throughout the day to stay hydrated and to take their rest breaks. Most importantly if one of our drivers needs immediate assistance due to extreme heat local UPS personnel respond by coming to their location to help them safely return to their delivery center or arrange for immediate assistance at their location. We never want our employees to continue working to the point that they risk their health or work in an unsafe manner.

We have a dedicated employee-led health and safety team who review work practices and promote health awareness creating a collaborative approach between front-line employees and management through our Comprehensive Health and Safety Process (CHSP). CHSP members regularly meet at UPS facilities to discuss health and safety and put their ideas into action that raise awareness and provide the resources that help keep their co-workers safe. Their roles also involve mentoring employees on hydration wellness and safe work methods. All these efforts and collaboration are designed to ensure that every UPS employee makes the most important stop daily which is when they safely arrive home after their workday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vYWJvdXQudXBzLmNvbS91cy9lbi9vdXItaW1wYWN0L3ZhbHVlcy9pbmNsdXNpb24tYmVsb25naW5nL3RyYW5zZ2VuZGVyLWxlYWRlci1zdGFuZHMtZm9yLXdvcmtwbGFjZS1hdXRoZW50aWNpdHktLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Transgender leader stands for workplace authenticity,"What’s the story: Janice Mohamed is a proud UPSer who’s empowering the LGBTQ+ community through advocacy. Her leadership inspires people to bring their authentic selves to the workplace.

“Throughout my life there has always been a nagging feeling” said Janice. “What are the people I work with going to think if I come out?”

Tough choices: When Janice was new to the company she struggled with how to introduce herself and her true identity. She decided to create a moment and share her life experience with her team.

“There are still LGBTQ+ people out there in the business world who may not feel comfortable coming out. Being a good ally means helping them feel safe bringing their true selves to work.”

That moment of bravery inspired Janice to actively campaign for human rights in the workplace and in her private life through organizations like the European Transgender Symposium Workplace Pride International Conference and the ILGA World Conference.

In her words: “I’m proud to work for an organization like UPS. Our leaders empower and celebrate the uniqueness of every UPSer … and with that everyone can bring their authentic selves and give their best.”

Allyship at UPS:

UPS was ranked by the Human Rights Campaign as one of the best places to work for LGBTQ+ equality in 2021.

in 2021. UPS is partnered with the National LGBT Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC) to provide direct financial support to 13 LGBTQ+-owned businesses in the U.S. U.K. and Germany.

From now to July of next year when the current contract is set to expire UPS workers will be fighting for their demands and preparing to strike if they are not met. Among those demands are: air-conditioned trucks no more excessive overtime an end to the two-tier system of “22.4s” higher part-time pay more full-time jobs an end to harassment and an end to outsourcing. If UPS Teamsters don’t reach a suitable agreement with the company over 340000 workers could go on strike bringing UPS — which moves 6% of the U.S. GDP — to a grinding halt.

It is no surprise that the bosses are afraid. Since the contract campaign began UPS has ramped up its union busting tactics particularly targeting activist workers. The company’s goal is clear: to instill fear and weaken the collective power and organization of UPS Teamsters. On Wednesday August 24 in an act of blatant retaliation UPS fired Ben Douglass and Rob Becker both alternate shop stewards at their respective workplaces.

Douglass has been a driver for almost two years and an alternate shop steward for one during which time he has consistently fought for his coworkers. Ben pushed for workers to take up the fight for COVID-19 safety measures such as on-site testing and temperature checks. During the heatwave he fought for fans and AC encouraging workers to take breaks to cool off hydrate and stay safe. Ben along with many coworkers and other union activists has also taken up broader struggles for racial gender and sexual equality sometimes organizing coworkers to march together as Teamsters in movements beyond the workplace. The official reason given by management for firing Douglass was that he was unable to complete a challenging route in the midst of a heatwave.





Yesterday in an act of complete retaliation @UPS fired me from the job on bogus charges. But this isn't just about me — what UPS is doing is part of a larger retaliation against union organizers and sympathizers especially as the @Teamsters ramp up our 2023 contract fight. — Ben (@BenFredericks) August 25 2022

Becker has been working for UPS for eight years and works out of the Nassau building on Long Island in New York. Despite having worked through the whole pandemic the company is treating him as totally disposable. Becker has been targeted in particular because he helped sign his coworkers up to join the “9.5 list” a contractual agreement that limits forced overtime. Becker was dismissed for stopping to buy green tea in the midst of a heat wave. This retaliation is particularly stark as it happens against a backdrop of increasing attention on UPS for not providing air conditioning in trucks even in the midst of oppressive summer heat which has resulted in drivers experiencing heat strokes and even dying.

As Douglass recently pointed out on Twitter this retaliation is happening “while [workers] are forced to work in the brutal summer heat without AC often without even a fan. Many are seeing the horror stories of UPS workers collapsing from heat exhaustion. Esteban Chavez Jr. died because management refuses to prioritize safety.”

Once again @ups shows it’s true colors.



Yesterday a Long Island driver was FIRED because he stopped for 2 minutes for a green tea during a HEAT WAVE. Management says it was an unauthorized break.



We say it was retaliation against a UNION ACTIVIST.



The fight is on. pic.twitter.com/001WeGSrqV — Teamsters Local 804 (@804_local) August 25 2022

The retaliation isn’t just happening in New York it’s occurring all across the country. According to Sean Orr a UPS worker from Chicago “management tried to crack down on us wearing union hats while on property” as a way to intimidate workers and hide the massive support from the workers. The UPS workers at that facility answered the intimidation by moving their Teamsters meeting on Thursday inside their facility setting an example for workers across the country. As Sean said “Not one inch to the company!”

UPS is a multi-billion dollar company. Throughout the pandemic and even now the company is posting record profits — profits which have come off the back of workers like Douglass and Becker. Yet instead of providing workers with safe working conditions or even basic air conditioning in trucks in the crippling heat UPS targets workers who stand up for their basic rights.

UPS to maximize its profits is constantly searching for different ways of exploiting its workers. In the last contract for example UPS imposed a two-tier system which created a new “second-class” of drivers. These “combo workers” classified as “22.4s” do the same job as long-term drivers but are paid up to eight dollars per hour less with fewer benefits. The bosses also create a dangerous work environment demanding a high volume of packages to be delivered at nerve-wracking speed and hours-long shifts in traffic-jammed cities. But this isn’t limited to drivers alone — UPS also imposes grueling conditions on the warehouse workers who start their days as early as 1a.m. to guarantee that the trucks will be ready to deliver their packages across the state.

From Amazon to Starbucks to Trader Joe’s and even UPS bosses have ramped up their union busting because they are afraid. Workers know they are essential that they make everything run and when they stand up and fight together they can win. It is essential that we show solidarity with workers who are facing harassment and being fired."

But now there’s a major artistic effort to try to help Uvaldeans heal.

On a recent Sunday morning it was already sweltering at 9:30am and Tino Ortega is up on a lift painting a massive wall.

“We're actually in the heart of Uvalde. And we're here just painting murals of the victims” he said.

This project has created one mural apiece for the 19 students and two teachers killed on May 24th. Artist and El Pasoan Ortega knows about this kind of grief.

“Back in 2019 on August 3rd in El Paso when we had the mass shooting there we saw the community come together in so many ways” Ortega said. “That's why I'm here now because my gift is art and I try to give back in any way that I can.”

Ortega was painting student Jailah Nicole Silguero. His choice of Jailah wasn’t by accident. It reminded him of his family.

“It really hit close to home because it made me think of my own daughter. It made me think wow this could be me” he said. “So I'm just glad that I have support from her family. They've been here every night dropping off waters just hanging out.”

Houston Muralist Anat Ronen came down from her lift to talk. She’s impressed by the positive feeling in the other muralists’ work.

“You can feel the good energy coming out in the sense of not forgetting and moving on but honoring and celebrating life” she said.

Ronen chose to paint athletic Tess Maria Mata.

“Tess was incredibly good in softball and she loved Jose Altuve She liked the Houston Astros” Ronen said.

Given that there was a cartoon-style and a photographic-style cat on her mural it’s apparent that Tess was a cat lover.

“She had a cat—Oliver—and I represented it here” Ronen said. “The family came yesterday a few times and they're very excited very appreciative. And it's really emotional.”

No amount of murals can ever change what happened. But they might affect the way forward if slightly.

“It doesn't change the horrific nature of it but it helps people to cope with it maybe and then try to continue on with their lives” Ronen said.

The Austin muralist who goes by the name of Uloang was cheery despite his four hours sleep.

“Painting a mural in summer outdoors is in Texas is something I try to avoid” Uloang said. “In fact I have several murals on hold because it's just too hot.”

The heat didn’t keep him from volunteering his sweat equity into the mural project. But it did determine when he painted.

“I would get here at 6 a.m. work till maybe noon until it became unbearable and then come back at 7:30 p.m. and work till one or 2 a.m.. And last night we were here till 5 a.m.” Uloang said.

His portrait is enormous—a little girl in a stream filled with lily pads and koi fish.

“I painted Maranda Mathis. Her mom Deana mentioned that she loved being in nature being outdoors picking up rocks from the ground” he said.

Jack Morgan Artist Uluong's Maranda Mathis mural

Painting the portrait from a picture Deanna gave to him Uloang has Maranda’s eyes locked with you the viewer and she’s reaching toward you.

“In the original picture she was holding river rocks. But when I was sketching it I decided to put an amethyst crystal in there” Uloang said. “She told me that when she saw that it was Amethyst Crystal in the sketch she got chills because that's Deana's birthstone.”

For these artists as they painted and saw the children emerge where once was a blank wall it was an emotional experience.

“I could see her personality coming through. And I just kind of felt like ‘oh hi Maranda. There you are!’ I could barely hold it together when that was happening. Definitely shed a few tears” he said.

Texas embraces mural art. And in a small town like Uvalde a project like this can move the needle in a town’s self-concept. Any large mural project needs someone to find the paint and secure locations. In this case it’s Austin’s Monica Maldonado who runs the non-profit Mas Cultura. The shootings were personally staggering to her.

“I knew that I have to come down to Uvalde to pay my respects and to gain some sense of peace if that even makes sense” Maldonado said.

She drove to Uvalde went to Robb Elementary and stopped in front of each memorial cross for every child and teacher.

“And at that moment I knew that God was going to use me” she said. “I didn't know how but I knew that I would be involved in some way in the journey of healing for Uvalde.”

Maldonado wasn’t the only artist feeling that they need to do something. Early on Uvaldean and art professor Abel Ortiz had a vision.

“The idea was to make it monumental. So I said we need 21 murals across town” Ortiz said.

Ortiz decided that each one of the victims deserved murals dedicated to exactly who they were.

“We never want to forget their faces. That's why they had to be murals of portraits and not just regular murals” he said.

Ortiz got started securing walls and artists but he only knew so many Texas muralists. He needed help so Maldonado became project manager. Creating 21 murals is expensive: power-washing each wall before its first coat of primer which goes at $170 for a five-gallon bucket. As to the total cost for materials per each mural Maldonado said it’s not cheap.

“I would say we average probably $1200 or $1500” she said. “And that's just basic. That's not the artists because they've all volunteered their time.”

The work has been split between 21 artists and helpers three per weekend since July 9th. With 20-foot square murals artists needed a lift to paint from. United Rentals from Carrizo Springs made several available for free.

“They drive every weekend one hour here to deliver the equipment to us and then they come back to pick the equipment up at the end of the weekend” Maldonado said.

The project’s expense is astronomical but then there are the unexpected gifts.

“The first weekend we paid for our meals. And I think ever since that first weekend we haven't” she said. “The community has shown up with pasta with salad with fruit with beverages.”

Throughout the day cars show up and people get out of their cars to thank the artists. One family arrived and talked to Tino Ortega. Veronica Luevanos stood in front of Jailah’s mural and next to Jayce Luevanos’s.

Jack Morgan Jailah Silguero's family in front of her mural

“That's my daughter. And that's my nephew” she said.

Veronica Luevanos lost not one but two beloved family members. She spoke about her daughter.

“She was an energetic little girl. She loved dancing playing outside being around her friends” she said.

Luevanos provided that picture Tino painted from a smiling Jailah in a dress with Uvalde on the front.

“It’s a Uvalde cheerleading outfit. Every Friday when it was football season they would wear their uniforms to school” Luevanos said.

I asked her what she would tell to those hearing Jailah’s story. She said to ‘love on your baby.’

“Just love on your baby. Love on your baby” she said.

Artist Uloang hopes the murals can help Uvaldeans heal.

“All these children and everybody that was lost they all have their own unique stories and personalities and they all had their own hopes and dreams” Uloang said. “And hopefully these murals can help tell people what they were like share a little bit about them their personalities and their spirit.”

Two more murals created by local children are in the process of being painted.

Housing accounted for 35% of all consumer spending in February 2022 with the average American shelling out $1151.

Not all Americans are being affected equally though. Members of Gen Z reported the largest increase in housing prices with their monthly spending rising 34% from last year. Those earning less than $50000 experienced the largest increase in housing prices compared to middle-income and high-income earners.

Overall renters have experienced a 15% increase in housing costs since February 2021.

And as mortgage rates rise it becomes more expensive to buy meaning homeownership gets more and more out of reach. That in turn boosts demand for rentals and allows landlords to charge more.

“Rents are up $284 per month through February as well making it much harder for renters to save up for the largest hurdle to home ownership — the down payment” says Zillow spokesperson Mark Stayton.

Even with recent increases there are major cities that still offer reasonable rents. Here are the top 10 cities where rent is cheapest for a two-bedroom property according to furniture shopping site Living Cozy.

10. Raleigh North Carolina

Average rent: $1298

9. Fresno California

The suit alleges the company’s 401(k) retirement plan invested in low-performing target-date funds. John Rex gave preferential priority to UnitedHealth’s relationship with Wells Fargo which managed the funds and kept those interests even when they underperformed the lawsuit alleges. The news was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.

The suit was launched by Kim Snyder who worked for UnitedHealth Group as a nurse and argues that UnitedHealth breached its fiduciary duty to plan participants under terms of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Snyder launched the lawsuit in 2021 and Rex was recently added as a defendant to the case Aug. 24.

The lawsuit is not the first time UnitedHealth Group has been alleged to put its own business interests first. Earlier this year the company's subsidiary United Behavioral Health (UBH) was ordered to pay more than $20 million for wrongly denying mental health coverage claims. A California court found UBH wrongfully denied claims in order to protect its bottom line and violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS90d2luY2l0aWVzL25ld3MvMjAyMi8wOC8yNS9jbGFzcy1hY3Rpb24tdW5pdGVkaGVhbHRoLTQwMWstY2ZvLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UnitedHealth CFO is added to class-action lawsuit over 401(k) plan - Minneapolis / St. Paul Business Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/news/2022/08/25/class-action-unitedhealth-401k-cfo.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS90d2luY2l0aWVzL25ld3MvMjAyMi8wOC8yNS9jbGFzcy1hY3Rpb24tdW5pdGVkaGVhbHRoLTQwMWstY2ZvLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vYmloZWFsdGhuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FtYXpvbi1jYXJlLXNodXQtZG93bi1lbmQtMjAyMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon Care to shut down at the end of 2022,"Amazon plans to sunset its Amazon Care employer offering at the end of the year according to an internal memo first reported by GeekWire and Fierce Healthcare.

The email from Neil Lindsay senior vice president of Amazon Health Services said the service will officially shut down on December 31. The decision only affects Amazon Care and its Care Medical group of providers not the company's other healthcare projects.

""This decision wasn’t made lightly and only became clear after many months of careful consideration"" Lindsay wrote to Amazon Health Services employees. ""Although our enrolled members have loved many aspects of Amazon Care it is not a complete enough offering for the large enterprise customers we have been targeting and wasn’t going to work long-term.""

THE LARGER TREND

Amazon Care launched in 2019 as a virtual clinic for its own employees but the service later expanded to outside employers. Earlier this year the company announced it was adding in–person care options in more than 20 new cities in 2022 including New York San Francisco Chicago and Miami.

Just weeks ago Insider reported on a live website that detailed the addition of behavioral health services to Amazon Care including a partnership with digital mental health company Ginger.

But the tech and retail giant has already made big news in healthcare this year. In late July Amazon announced plans to acquire hybrid primary care provider One Medical in an all-cash deal worth approximately $3.9 billion. The deal hasn't yet closed.

Amazon is also reportedly one of the bidders for in-home health technology and services provider Signify Health according to The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg News. Other interested players include UnitedHealth Group CVS Health and Option Care Health.

The Amazon Care shutdown isn't the company's first failure in the healthcare space either. Its employer-focused joint venture with Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase wrapped up operations early last year.

Paddy Padmanabhan founder and CEO of healthcare and technology advisory Damo Consulting said success as a stand-alone primary care provider is difficult to achieve even with Amazon's consumer focus and analytical abilities.

""Amazon Care was launched on the back of lofty promises of superior customer service and a focus on primary care"" he said. ""Primary care is a loss-making business with low reimbursements for most organizations and healthcare enterprises keep score by whether they lose less money on primary care than the hospital down the street.

Some investors like to follow in the footsteps of Warren Buffett and buy the same stocks he does. It's no surprise that one of the stocks he has been buying up the most this year Occidental Petroleum has also been one of the hottest -- it is up 140% while the S&P 500 has fallen by 13%.

But rather than trying to ride Buffett's coattails investors can look for similar stocks that fit his investing strategy and that aren't in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. By doing this and not following the crowd you could set yourself up for better gains down the road.

A couple of Buffett-type stocks to consider buying for the long haul right now are UnitedHealth Group (UNH 0.89%) and Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD 0.98%).

1. UnitedHealth Group

Buffett is a fan of the insurance business and in 1996 he bought GEICO which is now a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway.

UnitedHealth is the largest health insurance company in the U.S. and could complement Berkshire's portfolio. Its business is broader than just insurance however as its Optum business focuses on providing health services including OptumRx which delivers medications to patients' homes.

UnitedHealth has also been growing via acquisitions. Earlier this year it announced plans to acquire home health company LHC Group for $5.4 billion. What might appeal to Buffett about the business is that amid that growth and expansion UnitedHealth has consistently generated a profit.

This type of consistency makes it a whole lot easier to project where the business might be in the next 10 years. Stocks that lack such consistency and predictability such as those involved in tech often aren't Buffett buys for that reason. UnitedHealth's stable growth and its reliable predictable business is why this could easily be a stock in Berkshire's portfolio.

Although its valuation is a bit rich at nearly 30 times earnings (the average healthcare stock trades at 21 times its profits) with an aging U.S. population and an ongoing need for health coverage it's a safe assumption to make that UnitedHealth's profits will continue growing over the years which will make its earnings multiple look smaller in the future.

For long-term investors UnitedHealth is the type of stock you can just buy and forget.

2. Anheuser-Busch InBev

Another area that is a Buffett favorite is consumer goods. And if Buffett wasn't busy consuming Coca-Cola products which he once stated account for one-quarter of his daily calories it's possible other beverage companies would find their way into Berkshire's portfolio. But what's clear is that Buffett values top brands and Anheuser-Busch InBev owns some popular ones including Budweiser Bud Light and Stella Artois.

The knock on Anheuser-Busch is that its business hasn't always generated much in the way of growth. But the business is expanding into seltzers and canned cocktails as part of its beyond-beer products in a way to diversify its business and stay on top of consumer trends. Anheuser-Busch's consistent profits can help fuel that growth down the road.

The stock trades at 28 times earnings which isn't cheap but the business should perform better as the economy returns to normal. The pandemic has negatively impacted its profits especially in the early stages amid lockdowns and restrictions. When factoring in analyst projections the stock is trading at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 17 -- that's in line with the S&P 500 average of 18.

Anheuser-Busch's financials look sound and with the stock down 15% this year it could make for an attractive buy on the dip.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTA4LTI1L21lbnRhbC1oZWFsdGgtc3RhcnR1cC1hbG1hLXJhaXNlcy0xMzAtbWlsbGlvbi10by1leHBhbmQtcGxhdGZvcm3SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alma Raises $130 Million to Expand Platform for Mental Health Clinicians,"Why did this happen?

At a special event on Rethinking and rebuilding resilient health systems in Africa during the 22 – 26 August Regional Committee meeting in Lomé Togo delegates examined the measures that have worked in achieving universal access to health care as well as the shortfalls. They also explored ways to maintain essential services during outbreaks and the investments and actions needed to ensure equitable access to quality medical products and health technologies.

“The scope and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic put great pressure on Senegal’s health system” said Dr Marie Khemesse Ngom Ndiaye Senegal’s Minister of Health. But “thanks to (its) Resilience Programme and Investment Plan Senegal’s health system has considerably strengthened disease prevention and management capacities.”

COVID-19 has not only exerted enormous pressure on health systems but also sounded the alarm on the need to reform and revitalize the continent’s health systems. Even as countries stepped up measures including surveillance prevention clinical care and vaccination in the wake of the pandemic further efforts are essential to render the health systems more robust and resilient.

The pandemic has also added to the African region’s existing health challenges. More than any other part of the world the region responds to more than 100 health emergencies every year. During emergencies many countries face shutdowns of health programmes due to staff reassignments supply chain disruptions as well as movement restrictions. These disruptions undermine progress towards universal health coverage and lay bare inequities in access to health care.

“The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the fragility of our continent’s health infrastructure and the urgent need to strengthen the overall health system to secure access to quality care for all Africa’s people when and where they need it without incurring financial hardship” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti WHO Regional Director to Africa. “Domestic investment in health including health research has significant economic returns while promoting resilience and sustainability; healthy populations translate to healthy economies.”

Despite the disruptions due to outbreaks and other challenges African countries have made progress in improving access to health services. For example the number of countries scoring over 40% (“medium coverage”) on the universal health coverage index has increased from three out of 47 countries to 35 between 2000 and 2019.

The special event launched at the Regional Committee kicks off a collective process to support African countries as they ramp up efforts to recover from the pandemic-triggered disruptions and work to rebuild better their health systems. A series of consultations and actions will follow to support countries in achieving universal health coverage and health security.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmljaXJuaWdlcmlhLm9yZy9sYWNrLW9mLWFtYnVsYW5jZS1lbWVyZ2VuY3ktc2VydmljZXMtaGFtcGVyLXVuaXZlcnNhbC1oZWFsdGgtY292ZXJhZ2UtaW4tcnVyYWwtYm9ybm8tY29tbXVuaXRpZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ambulance emergency services universal health coverage Borno,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.icirnigeria.org/lack-of-ambulance-emergency-services-hamper-universal-health-coverage-in-rural-borno-communities/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmljaXJuaWdlcmlhLm9yZy9sYWNrLW9mLWFtYnVsYW5jZS1lbWVyZ2VuY3ktc2VydmljZXMtaGFtcGVyLXVuaXZlcnNhbC1oZWFsdGgtY292ZXJhZ2UtaW4tcnVyYWwtYm9ybm8tY29tbXVuaXRpZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndoby5pbnQvYWJvdXQvZnVuZGluZy9jb250cmlidXRvcnMvYmVsZ2l1bdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Belgium - Funding,"The Government of Belgium has taken a leading role in global health working together with WHO to achieve equitable access to health care for all people everywhere especially those who are most vulnerable.

Rebuilding good health

To rethink and rebuild resilient health systems on the continent WHO’s Regional Committee for Africa has been meeting this week in Lomé Togo.

There they are examining measures in achieving universal access to health care and exploring how to maintain essential services during outbreaks as well as the investments and actions needed for quality medical products and health technologies.

“Domestic investment in health including health research has significant economic returns while promoting resilience and sustainability; healthy populations translate to healthy economies” said Dr. Moeti.

Health emergencies

COVID-19 has exerted enormous pressure on health systems adding to the African region’s existing health challenges which responds to more than 100 health emergencies every year according to WHO.

Emergencies trigger health programme shutdowns that undermine progress towards universal health coverage and lay bare inequities in access to health care.

A special event launched at the Regional Committee kicks off a collective process to support African countries as they ramp up efforts to recover from the pandemic-triggered disruptions and work to rebuild their health systems.

A series of consultations and actions will follow to support countries in achieving universal health coverage and health security.

Cholera in Malawi

Meanwhile WHO and the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) are stepping up efforts to contain and prevent the spread of cholera in Malawi.

The outbreak initially limited to the southern part of the country has now spread to Malawi's northern and central regions.

To date 1483 cases and 58 deaths have been recorded with the case fatality rate at 3.9 per cent according to a Government press statement issued on Monday.

Cases continue to rise outside the traditional hotspot districts affecting lakeshore communities and crowded urban areas with insufficient water and sanitation facilities.

“The impact of the larger outbreak will overwhelm the already over-burdened public health services and health-care delivery systems in the country so we must act now” said UNICEF Malawi Representative Rudolf Schwenk.

“The good news is that we know the solutions”.

Funding gap

Despite continuing efforts in the national cholera outbreak response significant gaps exist including the urgent need for early detection and management; critical supplies to manage cases and for water treatment personal hygiene and water storage at the household level; and communications around prevention and positive hygiene practices.

UNICEF and WHO are appealing to partners and donors for additional funds and support to address these challenges and contain the outbreak.

“Every death from cholera is preventable with the tools we have today” said WHO Country Representative Neema Rusibamayila Kimambo upholding that the UN agency will continue to support the Health Ministry in “implementing immediate and long-term cholera control response and preventive measures”.

Since the declaration of a cholera outbreak last March UNICEF and WHO have been working closely with the Ministries of Health Water and Sanitation district authorities and others in developing and coordinating a response plan to deliver essential supplies and services to the families and communities in Malawi’s cholera-affected districts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c2luZm8uaW5xdWlyZXIubmV0LzE2NTI2MjMvcDI5Ni0zLWItaGVhbHRoLWJ1ZGdldC1mb3ItMjAyMy1oaWdoZXItYnV0LXN0aWxsLW5vdC1lbm91Z2jSAWVodHRwczovL25ld3NpbmZvLmlucXVpcmVyLm5ldC8xNjUyNjIzL3AyOTYtMy1iLWhlYWx0aC1idWRnZXQtZm9yLTIwMjMtaGlnaGVyLWJ1dC1zdGlsbC1ub3QtZW5vdWdoL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,P296.3-B health budget for 2023: Higher but still ‘not enough’,"MANILA Philippines—The proposed P296.3 billion budget for the health sector next year seemed enormous but given the problems confronting the country’s health care system the group Filipino Nurses United (FNU) said it was not enough.

It was last Monday (Aug. 22) when the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) submitted to Congress the proposed P5.268 trillion national budget for 2023 and part of it is the P296.3 billion that the health sector is expected to receive.

The proposal which is 4.9 percent higher than this year’s allotted has allocated most of the proposed P5.268 trillion for education (P852.8 billion) infrastructure (P718.4 billion) health (P296.3 billion) agriculture (184.1 billion) and social protection (P197 billion).

It was stressed by the DBM that the P296.3 billion proposed budget for the health sector is 10.4 percent higher than this year’s to strengthen the health care system especially with the still existing threats of infectious diseases.

Budget Secretary Amenah Pangandaman said P29 billion has been allocated for the procurement of medicines and vaccines while P19 billion has been earmarked for the salary and benefits of health care workers.

Likewise the Health Facilities Enhancement Program which will fund the procurement of new medical equipment as well as the construction and rehabilitation of government’s health care facilities.

But FNU said the P296.3 billion proposed budget for the health sector is not enough to address the health crisis including the lack of health care workers in government hospitals.

It said the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. should prioritize people’s health and the wellbeing of health care workers by increasing the national health budget to P900 billion or 10 percent of gross domestic product.

Heath workers’ benefits

Considering that the Department of Health (DOH) has been “falling short” of providing COVID-19 benefits such as the One COVID-19 Allowance (OCA) and the need to increase the salary of nurses the FNU said it was bothered by the allocation.

Last Feb. 17 the DBM released P7.92 billion to the DOH for the OCA of 526727 eligible public and private health care workers who are identified to be at high risk (P9000); medium risk (P6000) and low risk (P3000).

The OCA shall be given in full provided that the health professional physically reports to work for at least 96 hours every month. Otherwise it shall be prorated the DOH said.

Out of the P7.92 billion P4.50 billion is for OCA of 100313 DOH plantilla employees in public hospitals offices and rehabilitation centers including those who are in military and state university hospitals.

The remaining P3.42 billion is for OCA of 426414 health care workers in local government units and private health facilities. But last June the DOH said 126727 health care workers have not yet received their OCA.

Health Undersecretary Leopoldo Vega had told radio station dzBB that the DOH was already coordinating especially with the Private Hospitals Association of the Philippines about the list of hospitals with health care workers who have not yet received their OCA.

Vega stressed that health care workers who have not yet received their OCA will do so under the Marcos administration but last Aug. 12 the Alliance of Health Workers (AHW) said some health care workers have yet to receive that allowance.

This as health care workers in hospitals that are classified as “government-owned and controlled corporations” staged protests to call on the DOH to immediately distribute their OCA.

They said health care workers at the Philippine Heart Center (PHC) have so far only received their OCA in January 2022 while those from the National Kidney and Transplant Institute (NKTI) have so far just received their OCA for January to March.

“It is so discouraging and exasperating that when it comes to our much deserved COVID-19 benefits the DOH and this government always [have] no budget to allocate” said Salome Ejes acting president of AHW-PHC.

Preventing nurses’ exodus

FNU stressed that increasing the salary of nurses is seen as an “immediate and effective remedy” to prevent them from leaving the Philippines because of low pay and lack of improvement in working conditions.

Citing data from the DOH it said out of 915219 registered nurses in the Philippines 316415 or one-third had already migrated while 124999 nurses are without any specified field of practice.

This as the average entry level pay of nurses in the Philippines is only P8000 to P13500 every month too small compared to the entry level pay in the United States ($3800) United Kingdom (£1662) and Canada ($4097).

Last June Marie Umalla 24 who left for the United Arab Emirates had told INQUIRER.net that “with how my work was being compensated I won’t be able to provide for the needs of my family. This was the reason that I decided to leave.”

The DOH had asked the government to implement measures to stop the migration of health care workers especially nurses saying that “this should be a whole-of-government approach”.

“The so-called brain drain in the country needs to be addressed by the government because we need our health care workers to stay here in the country to help our health care system.”

It said it is working to resolve the problems being confronted by nurses: “We are incentivizing our nurses. We’re giving them health care benefits and allowances so they’ll be more interested in working in our country.”

But FNU stressed that a higher and adequate national health budget will ”very well” respond to a proposal to increase the entry-level pay of nurses in public and private hospitals with subsidies to private health care clinics.

Likewise it said the government should hire 42000 more nurses to address the lack of health care workers noting that only 65000 to 70000 were employed by the government with thousands on contractual basis for three to six months.

This as nurses have been “burdened” with 20 to 50 patients every shift when the ideal nurse-to-patient ratio is 1:12.

FNU stressed that in government hospitals though nurses have relatively higher pay they suffer from work and patient overload in the same way as those in private hospitals do.

Strengthen public health system

The Universal Health Care Act was signed by then President Rodrigo Duterte in 2019 but access to quality and inexpensive health care and even the lack of nurses are still confronting millions of Filipinos.

The University of the Philippines had said that “six out of 10 Filipinos die without even seeing a doctor” and that “the high cost of health care in the country prevents people from accessing life-saving services and drowns families further into poverty.”

Based on data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) six out of 10 deaths in 2016 were not medically attended indicating that out of the 582183 registered deaths that year 342705 were not attended by a health professional.

The PSA said only Metro Manila had a greater number of medically attended deaths (42045) than those that were not attended (34669). This meant that Metro Manila “has better access to health facilities”.

The top three regions which had the most deaths that were not attended by a health professional were Calabarzon (48507) Central Luzon (42832) and even Metro Manila (34669).

FNU said many Filipinos get sick and die of poverty and preventable diseases. Ronnie Baticulon said in a CNN Philippines column that every year one million patients are driven to poverty because of catastrophic health expenses.

“Public health care should be strengthened by providing an adequate budget for essential life-saving medicines vaccines modern equipment and ensuring adequate nurses and other health care workers” FNU said.

This as it stressed that the government should not fall short in responding to the continuing COVID-19 crisis the increase of infectious diseases such as dengue and the threat of emerging diseases like monkeypox.

When Marcos delivered his first State of the Nation Address last month he said he would want to add more specialized hospitals like the PHC and NKTI in the regions to extend medical assistance to Filipinos.

“It’s clear to us that we need these types of hospitals outside the National Capital Region” he said.

But the proposed 2023 budget for the University of the Philippines system which includes the Philippine General Hospital (PGH) has decreased by almost P2.5 billion indicating that the proposed budget for the PGH went down by P893 million.

Neglect from the past

The PWC had said that the problem of inequality still exists as health care remains out of reach for many people: “The absence of an integrated health network has had a negative impact on economic and geographic access as well as on quality and efficiency of health services.”

The think tank Ibon Foundation said the Duterte administration which preceded Marcos’ “severely neglected the public health system of the country.”

“In the past six years the government has not taken significant measures that will strengthen the public health system and make health services accessible and equitable to the Filipino people.”

It said Duterte’s budget for the health sector then was “low and misallocated”.

Based on data from the DOH the allocation for the health sector which includes the department and the Philippine Insurance Health Corporation (PhilHealth) was only P270 billion in 2022 P212 billion in 2021 P176 billion in 2020 P169 billion in 2019 P171 billion in 2018 P151 billion in 2017 and P126 billion in 2016.

“First Duterte’s health sector budget remains low and misallocated. Every year the budget share of the health sector is much lower compared to the country’s military and infrastructure budget. For 2022 the Department of Public Works and Highways got 15.7 percent or P786.6 billion while the Department of National Defense got 4.4 percent or P220.9 billion” Ibon Foundation said.

It explained that a large slice of the small budget for the health sector in 2022 went to social health insurance and not to direct health services such as the operational budget of several government hospitals and laboratories.

For 2022 30 percent went to PhilHealth while the remaining 70 percent went to the DOH: “Out of the total DOH budget only P55 billion is allocated for the operation of DOH hospitals and other regional health facilities national laboratories and blood centers.”

The think tank likewise said that despite the Duterte administration’s focus on infrastructure projects there is a glaring lack of health infrastructure built.

El personal de la Junta de Recursos del Aire de California detalló la propuesta el jueves antes de que la política innovadora fuera aprobada. Se espera que la aprobación provoque un efecto dominó en toda la industria automotriz y en todo el país.

Aunque el plan de California establece la hoja de ruta más agresiva de la nación para la transición a los automóviles eléctricos no elimina los vehículos de pasajeros que funcionan con combustibles fósiles. Las personas pueden seguir conduciendo vehículos a gasolina y comprar usados ​​después del 2035. El plan también permite que una quinta parte de las ventas después de 2035 sean híbridos que funcionen con baterías y gasolina.

Washington y Massachusetts ya han dicho que seguirán el ejemplo de California y es probable que muchos más lo hagan: Nueva York y Pensilvania se encuentran entre los 17 estados que tienen algunos o todos los estándares de emisiones de los tubos de escape de California que son más estrictos que las normas federales.

“Este es un momento histórico para California para nuestros estados socios y para el mundo a medida que establecemos este camino hacia un futuro con cero emisiones” dijo Liane Randolph.

Laurie Holmes de Kia Corp dijo que la compañía planea gastar $ 25 mil millones para 2025 en vehículos eléctricos y espera ofrecer siete modelos para 2027. Pero ella y varios otros representantes de compañías automotrices dijeron que están preocupados por el cronograma del estado dado factores tales como los desafíos de la cadena de suministro y el alto costo de los materiales para construir autos eléctricos.

“Los fabricantes de automóviles podrían tener dificultades significativas para cumplir con este objetivo dados los elementos fuera del control de la industria” dijo.

El cambio de automóviles de gasolina a eléctricos reducirá drásticamente las emisiones y los contaminantes del aire pero la transición será dolorosa para la industria petrolera del estado. California sigue siendo el séptimo estado productor de petróleo más grande aunque su producción está cayendo a medida que avanza con los objetivos climáticos.

Las ventas de BYD aumentaron un 300% desde 202 y vendieron 641 000 vehículos en la primera mitad del año frente a los 564000 de Tesla explicó Yahoo Finance que añadió que ahora China domina cada vez más la cadena de suministro de baterías de litio.

California no debería envolver toda su estrategia de transporte en torno a un mercado de vehículos alimentado por electricidad dijo Tanya DeRivi vicepresidenta de política climática de Western States Petroleum Association un grupo de la industria petrolera.

“Los californianos deberían poder elegir una tecnología de vehículos incluidos los vehículos eléctricos que mejor se adapte a sus necesidades en función de la disponibilidad la asequibilidad y la necesidad personal” dijo.

California es el estado más poblado de la nación con alrededor de 39 millones de personas. Representan el 10%. del mercado de automóviles de EE. UU. pero tienen el 43% de los 2.6 millones de vehículos enchufables registrados en el país según la junta aérea.

Alrededor del 16% de los autos vendidos en California en los primeros tres meses de este año fueron eléctricos y para 2026 el estado quiere que la cifra llegue a un tercio.

Alcanzar el objetivo del 100% para 2035 significará superar obstáculos muy prácticos en particular suficientes estaciones de energía y carga confiables. California ahora tiene alrededor de 80 000 estaciones en lugares públicos muy por debajo de las 250 000 que quiere para 2025. La Alianza para la Innovación Automotriz que representa a muchos de los principales fabricantes de automóviles señaló la falta de infraestructura acceso a los materiales necesarios para fabricar baterías y cadena de suministro. entre los desafíos para cumplir con el cronograma del estado.

De hecho el nuevo compromiso se produce cuando California trabaja para mantener una electricidad confiable mientras se aleja de las centrales eléctricas a gas en favor de la energía solar eólica y otras fuentes de energía más limpias. A principios de este año los principales funcionarios de energía advirtieron que el estado podría quedarse sin energía durante los días más calurosos del verano lo que ocurrió brevemente en agosto de 2020.

Mira cuánto costaría.

Eso no ha sucedido todavía este año. Pero Newsom está presionando para mantener abierta la última planta nuclear restante del estado más allá de su cierre planificado en 2025 y el estado puede recurrir a generadores diésel o plantas de gas natural como respaldo cuando la red esté sobrecargada.

Agregar más cargadores de automóviles generará una mayor demanda en la red de energía.

Garantizar el acceso a las estaciones de carga también es clave para aumentar las ventas de vehículos eléctricos. El proyecto de ley de infraestructura aprobado por el Congreso el año pasado proporciona $ 5 mil millones para que los estados construyan cargadores cada 50 millas (80 kilómetros) a lo largo de las carreteras interestatales. Mientras tanto Newsom se ha comprometido a gastar miles de millones para impulsar las ventas de vehículos de cero emisiones incluso agregando cargadores en vecindarios de bajos ingresos. Las reglas dicen que los vehículos deben poder viajar 150 millas con una sola carga.

Manejar un vehículo eléctrico largas distancias hoy en día incluso en California requiere una planificación cuidadosa sobre dónde detenerse y cargar dijo Mary Nichols expresidenta de la Junta de Recursos del Aire de California. El dinero del gobierno estatal y federal contribuirá a impulsar esa infraestructura y hacer que los autos eléctricos sean una opción más conveniente dijo.

“Este va a ser un proceso transformador y el mandato para la venta de vehículos es solo una parte” dijo.

Aunque el hidrógeno es una opción de combustible según las nuevas regulaciones los automóviles que funcionan con celdas de combustible han representado menos del 1% de las ventas de automóviles en los últimos años.

Tanto el estado como el gobierno tienen reembolsos de miles de dólares para compensar el costo de comprar autos eléctricos y las reglas tienen incentivos para que los fabricantes de autos pongan vehículos eléctricos usados ​​a disposición de personas de bajos y medianos ingresos. En los últimos 12 años California ha proporcionado más de $1000 millones en reembolsos por la venta de 478000 vehículos eléctricos híbridos o enchufables según la junta de aire.

Los funcionarios climáticos de California dicen que la nueva política del estado será la más ambiciosa del mundo porque establece puntos de referencia claros para aumentar las ventas de vehículos eléctricos en los próximos doce años.

Las nuevas reglas para vehículos eléctricos también requerirán la aprobación federal lo que se considera probable con el presidente Joe Biden en la Casa Blanca. Sin embargo un futuro presidente republicano podría desafiar la autoridad de California para establecer sus propios estándares de automóviles como lo hizo la administración Trump.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL2xhb3Bpbmlvbi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8yNC9sYS12ZW50YS1kZS12aXZpZW5kYXMtbnVldmFzLXNlLWRlc3Bsb21hLWVuLWVlLXV1LWEtbml2ZWxlcy1kZS0yMDE2LXBvci1sb3MtYWx0b3MtcHJlY2lvcy15LWxhcy10YXNhcy1yZWNvcmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,La venta de viviendas nuevas se desploma en EE.UU. a niveles de 2016 por los altos precios y las tasas récord,"El número de viviendas nuevas que se vendieron en el mes de julio llegó a su nivel más bajo en los últimos seis años debido al aumento en las tasas hipotecarias y al alto precio de las viviendas que ocasionaron una desaceleración de posibles compradores.

Según informó el Departamento de Comercio la compra de viviendas unifamiliares nuevas cayó un 12.6% a una tasa anual ajustada estacionalmente de 511000 unidades. Se trata del sexto mes consecutivo de caídas.

Los expertos esperaban que las ventas de casas nuevas cayeran un 2.5% el mes pasado. Sin embargo sobre una base anual las ventas de casas nuevas han bajado un 29.6%.

Por otro lado un informe de Redfin la semana pasada mostró que las cancelaciones de ventas de viviendas se dispararon en julio a otro máximo de dos. En julio se cancelaron alrededor de 63000 contratos de compra de viviendas lo que equivale al 16% de las viviendas que se contrataron ese mes.

“La profunda corrección del mercado inmobiliario de EE.UU. en 2022 continuó hasta julio con una fuerte disminución en la actividad de ventas y una reducción en la construcción de viviendas unifamiliares” dijo Ben Ayers economista sénior de Nationwide.

A pesar de la desaceleración en las compras el costo de una casa nueva siguió subiendo en julio con precios medios que subieron casi un 9 % en julio con respecto al mes anterior a $439400.

El colapso en las ventas de viviendas es la última evidencia de cómo el mercado inmobiliario ha comenzado a enfriarse a medida que la Reserva Federal aumenta las tasas de interés al ritmo más rápido en décadas para controlar la inflación histórica.

Los formuladores de políticas ya aprobaron dos aumentos consecutivos de las tasas de 75 puntos básicos en junio y julio y confirmaron que hay otro aumento de gran tamaño sobre la mesa en septiembre.

Tras los aumentos la tasa promedio de una hipoteca fija a 30 años la más popular entre los nuevos propietarios de viviendas subió a casi el 6% en junio aunque desde entonces se ha moderado. Eso es significativamente más alto que hace solo un año cuando las tasas se ubicaron en 2.86%.

Combinado con los altos precios de las viviendas el rápido aumento en los costos de los préstamos ha empujado a muchos compradores de vivienda a retrasar o cancelar su decisión de compra.

California se ha convertido en el primer estado de Estados Unidos en limitar la venta de coches a gasolina.

La medida ha sido aprobada este jueves por la Junta de Recursos del del Aire de California (CARB por sus siglas en inglés) el organismo estatal a cargo de combatir la contaminación ambiental.

Y establece que a partir de 2035 todos los coches nuevos que se vendan tendrán que ser eléctricos o modelos híbridos.

El objetivo de la medida es reducir de forma drástica las emisiones de dióxido de carbono en las próximas dos décadas y quienes la impulsaron ya hablan de que supondrá toda una revolución de la industria automotriz del país.

Y es que California es un gran mercado para el sector con 29 millones de vehículos registrados.

Fuente de la imagen Getty Images Pie de foto Se podrán seguir adquiriendo coches a gasolina en el mercado de segunda mano o en otros estados.

La medida aún necesita la luz verde de las autoridades federales pero es algo que se da por hecho teniendo en cuenta la agenda ambiental de la administración Biden.

El gobernador Gavin Newson quien propuso la iniciativa hace dos años y le pidió a CARB elaborar un plan detallado la ha calificado de ""intrépida e innovadora"".

""Este es un momento histórico para California para nuestros estados socios y para el mundo"" dijo por su parte Liane Randolp presidenta de CARB en una comparecencia previa a la votación.

Implementación progresiva

La medida se irá implementando de forma progresiva.

Así para 2026 el 35% de los coches nuevos tendrán que ser cero emisiones un porcentaje que deberá aumentar hasta alcanzar el 68% para el 2030 y el 100% en cinco años más.

Los fabricantes que lo incumplan podrán enfrentar multas de hasta US$20.000 por unidad de acuerdo a CARB.

Los autos de este tipo ya han ido ganando popularidad en los últimos años en el estado.

Mientras en 2012 solo el 2% de los autos vendidos eran eléctricos para 2018 ya constituían el 7% de las ventas de vehículos nuevos.

Y a día de hoy el porcentaje de vehículos no contaminantes alcanza el 16% con un total de 113 millones registrados en el estado entre eléctricos e híbridos enchufables. Es el 43% de todos los vehículos de este tipo que existen a nivel nacional.

Fuente de la imagen Getty Images Pie de foto Para 2035 todos los vehículos que se vendan en California tendrán que ser eléctricos o híbridos enchufables.

También es una tendencia al alza en general en el país. De acuerdo a la Alianza por la Innovación Automotriz el 44% de todos los coches nuevos que se venden en EE.UU. son eléctricos el porcentaje más alto hasta la fecha.

Ahora con la nueva medida las autoridades californianas prevén que con el plan para 2040 las emisiones de los gases de efecto invernadero se reduzcan a la mitad.

Asimismo esperan recortar las emisiones de dióxido de nitrógeno que tiene un rol crucial en la formación del smog en un 25% para 2037.

Lo que expulsan los autos del tubo de escape constituye la principal fuente de carbono dióxido de California y en 2019 representó el 40% de las emisiones totales de gases de efecto invernadero.

Aunque la prohibición no implica que para 2035 los autos a gasolina dejarán de existir en el estado.

La medida se aplicará solo a autos camionetas y SUV nuevos. Seguirá siendo legal conducir vehículos con motor de combustión interna adquirirlos en el mercado de segunda mano o en otro estado.

Por ello algunos grupos ambientalistas han tachado la medida de poco ambiciosa.

""No es tan estricta como podría haber sido"" dijo al respecto Regina Hsu abogada en Earthjustice una organización sin ánimo de lucro dedicada a litigar en casos medioambientales.

Los estados de Washington y Massachusetts ya han dicho que seguirán el ejemplo de California en la materia y se espera que otras entidades también lo hagan. Y es que son varios los estados entre ellos Nueva York y Pensilvania los que han adoptado algunos o todos los estándares sobre emisiones establecidos por California hasta ahora más restrictivos que los federales.

Pero aunque sin precedentes en EE.UU. la de California no es la primera iniciativa de este tipo a nivel internacional.

El Parlamento Europeo respaldó en junio un plan para prohibir la venta de vehículos a gasolina y diésel en los 27 países del bloque para 2035.

Y Canadá también tiene un mandato para lograr el objetivo para esa misma fecha.

To this end a Memorandum of Understanding was already signed last December between Mastercard and LMKR.

Developed with Mastercard’s innovative technology the solution can be leveraged through the country’s transit infrastructure. It does away with the need to purchase separate tickets on rapid transit bus networks and e-tolling systems. Instead travelers can benefit from easy and secure payment experiences as they can top up or pay transit fares via debit or credit cards and digital wallets.

The latest initiative reflects Mastercard’s continuous efforts to extend its digital payment solutions to accelerate the widespread adoption of online payments in Pakistan. Such a move is expected to boost MA’s presence in the country. A growing digital economy in Pakistan driven by an increased Internet penetration and rising smartphone usage offers the perfect ground for Mastercard to capitalize on.

According to Mastercard’s New Payments Index 2022 89% of Pakistan’s consumers utilized at least one emerging payment method in 2021. Also 12% people in the country used less cash last year. The survey further highlighted that 68% of the country’s consumers increasingly resorted to digital payments in 2021.

As travelers remain inclined toward using smart devices and electronic payments amid their daily journeys the recent move of Mastercard to digitally enhance the transit infrastructure is aptly timed. Open-loop payments offer several advantages over cash usage or closed-loop payments such as fare cards on which transport providers had traditionally depended. Fare cards are loaded with a prepaid amount which needs to be refilled as soon as it gets exhausted. On the contrary open-loop payments are hassle-free in nature as they remain connected to the existing accounts or the daily payment products utilized by consumers.

Mastercard follows a public-private partnerships strategy in Pakistan and works in unison with the government or private sector companies to infuse digitization across various sectors of the economy. In March 2022 MA collaborated with Bank Alfalah one of the leading Pakistan-based private banks to launch nationwide two of its Mastercard Payment Gateway Services-backed cutting-edge digital payment solutions namely Tap on Phone and Simplify Commerce. An improved digital suite built through constant tie-ups and significant investments enables Mastercard to pursue digital transformation efforts globally.

Shares of Mastercard have lost 5% in a year compared with the industry’s decline of 27%.

Michael Hughes senior vice-president with London England-based GuardCap Asset Management Limited maintains that it’s far better to focus on a select group of equity winners that can ride out the ups and downs of the market cycle.

“The danger is that there may be more bad news to come that the markets are not considering” says Hughes who is also client portfolio manager with the firm that manages the $2 billion gold-rated 4-star BMO Concentrated Global Equity F (also available in Series D) a fund that is overseen by investment managers Michael Boyd and Giles Warren. Before joining GuardCap a subsidiary of Toronto-based Guardian Capital Group Ltd. in 2014 both men worked at London-based institutional fund manager Seilern Investment Management Ltd. where they honed the concentrated equity strategy now implemented at GuardCap. Boyd and Warren work closely with investment managers Bojana Bidovec and Orlaith O’Connor.

Not Out of the Woods on Inflation – and Interest Rates

“The key unknown and it’s an unknown that even the Federal Reserve has admitted to is that we don’t know how bad inflation will be. Therefore we don’t know if monetary policy will have to be tightened further” says Hughes adding that markets may be forgetting that the world has already gone through an environment of quantitative easing and extremely low interest rates to one where rates have risen somewhat in a heavily indebted world.

“The rule of thumb is that it takes about 18 months for monetary policy to have any impact on inflation. Essentially the global economy has not yet experienced the impact of tighter money and won’t do so for a while. There is a danger of news flow worsening and that’s being reflected in further market declines” says Hughes a 30-year industry veteran who joined GuardCap in 2014 after working for such firms as Trinity Street Asset Management and being responsible for the management of $72 billion in European equity assets for JP Morgan Asset Management in London.

The BMO fund is replicated in 47 different portfolios managed for institutional and retail investors in Britain U.S. and Canada. In total the GuardCap team oversees $17 billion of assets that rely on the concentrated strategy which focuses on a select group of companies and holds them for many years.

Hatches Already Battened

Making market predictions are not something Hughes’s firm spends a lot of time on. Instead they focus on managing a portfolio that is geared to deal with bear market conditions. “If markets are pricing in a worsening level of economic activity our strategy performs very strongly in comparison to the market” says Hughes noting that the strategy has not had a negative year since 2008. In contrast global markets suffered losses in 2011 2015 and 2018 (in US dollar terms). “We run a strategy expecting bad times. Indeed we are ready for bad times” says Hughes “That doesn’t mean you might miss out on the upside. But historically you have been well-protected against the downside.”

Year-to-date (August 18) BMO Concentrated Global Equity F (which was launched in May 2018) returned -13.29% versus -11.44% for the Global Equity category. Hughes attributes the lagging short-term performance largely to the fact that markets have been focusing on cyclical companies in which the fund does not invest. On a three-year basis the fund returned an annualized 8.25% versus 7.61% for the category.

Have Conviction in Your Defense

In light of the falling share prices in the first half of the year Hughes notes that the fund managers have not made any tactical shifts and taken advantage of lower stock prices. “We invest in 25 companies which as a whole work well in a bull market but have tended to significantly better when markets are falling. We don’t need to adjust the portfolio in the light of changing market conditions” says Hughes noting that the fund’s turnover is 15%. “As a general rule if your fund manager is reacting to changed market conditions it’s almost certainly too late anyway.”

The last major changes Warren and Boyd executed were in the first quarter of 2021 says Hughes adding that they reduced or sold holdings that were regarded as less attractively valued and took new positions known for their resilience. These new holdings include Danish food ingredient supplier Christian Hansen Holding A/S (CHR) US-based decision systems support provider Verisk Analytics Inc. (VRSK) and Coloplast A/S (COLO) a Danish medical components supplier.

Long Term Value at Heart

“They are engaged in areas such as the food and medical industries and have strong recurring earnings and revenues and a history of being able to grow even in periods of economic difficulty” observes Hughes. “And it’s not because our managers predicted a market downturn. It was simply because those companies looked to be better value from a long-term view” says Hughes adding that the fund tends to be fully invested at all times and the average holding period for stocks is about nine years.

Given the emphasis on stock-picking the geographic and sector weightings are a by-product of the stock selection process. Currently about 62% of the stocks are held in the U.S. and the rest are in international names. From a sector perspective consumer discretionary is the largest sector at 20% followed by 17.8% information technology 16.8% healthcare 15% consumer staples and 12.3% financial services.

The managers reduce the risk of over-concentration by taking several measures. “We don’t think that where a company is listed matters. What we do worry about is to make sure we are not exposed to any geographical market in terms of where our companies as a whole are doing business” says Hughes adding that the team tends to avoid industries such as oil raw materials and banks because their earnings are hard to predict. “We want to make sure that we don’t get over-exposed to a single market or set of markets. For example we ensure that no more than 50% of the portfolio’s sales go to the U.S. If it exceeds that then you start to be affected by the US dollar.” He adds that the fund’s standard deviation is 13.4% and below that of the benchmark MSCI World Index which is 17.6%. “The world index has 1600 companies. Our strategy has only 25 companies and yet it is less risky.”

Recipe for Risk Management and Growth

In scanning the stock universe the managers seek three main attributes:

First stocks must be in secular growth industries: “If the economy is doing well and markets are doing well you can do well. But if the economy turns down and markets do the same then usually these companies tend to outperform. If every single company in the portfolio is in a secular growth trend that means your portfolio as a whole can perform like the markets when they are rising and tend to perform much better when markets are falling.”

The second attribute is a sustainable competitive advantage. In short it means that the company is an industry leader and benefits from a competitive “moat” in the form of economies of scale or technological advantages that puts its ahead of competitors. “This allows you to look into the future of the company and determine its growth rate and market share in five years' time and do projections on its earnings so that you can value the company.”

The third attribute is quality in the form of a mature business that has low leverage and generates a lot of cash. “These characteristics are always in the portfolio. And they protect you when markets go down.”

Top Stock Picks

By way of example Hughes cites EssilorLuxottica SA (EL) a French-Italian leading provider of ophthalmic equipment and sunglasses such as the Ray-Ban brand. “The secular trend is an aging population. As you get older you need new glasses more frequently. The demand for vision correction lenses will keep rising for many years to come” says Hughes adding that the firm enjoys a competitive advantage because in 2021 the firm accounted for more R & D expenditure than the rest of the entire industry. “You can’t compete with it because of the quality and range of its products. Because it is expected to grow for many years the stock is under-valued in relation to its long-term growth” says Hughes adding that the firm is capable of delivering returns in excess of 10% a year. The stock which pays a 1.55% dividend is trading at 40.5 times earnings according to consensus estimates.

Another top holding is Novo Nordisk A/S (NOVO) a Danish multi-national pharmaceutical firm that specializes in treatments for diabetes that affects an estimated 450 million people around the world. “Within the sector that seeks solutions for diabetes the firm has been at the forefront in protein engineering and research for over 90 years so it has some advantages in terms of the quality of its products. It is in the forefront of the next wave of treatments for people who suffer from diabetes and other illnesses” says Hughes adding that Novo Nordisk benefits from economies of scale and a deep understanding of the disease. A holding since 2010 in the overall strategy Hughes estimates that the firm may potentially generate compound earnings per share growth of 12.7% for the next five years. In contrast the broader equity market is expected to grow only 7% a year.",,,,,,,,,

As colleges and universities continue offering students virtual options for classes – and some students admittedly waiting until the wee hours of the morning on term papers – reliable and affordable home internet shouldn’t be a concern.

“College is the first time many students live on their own and the first time they have to make decisions about choosing an internet service which is why we’re offering them super fast super reliable service on the 100% fiber-optic network at an incredible price” said Nina Bibby senior vice president consumer segment marketing at Verizon. “With the costs of attending college at an all-time high it’s important for students to know that they have a new choice for internet and most important: that they don’t need to sacrifice quality to save.”

Over the past year many higher-growth stocks tumbled as rising interest rates and other macro headwinds drove investors toward more conservative investments. That rotation caused the S&P 500 to enter a bear market in June and it still isn't out of the woods yet.

As that market malaise drags on investors should focus on resilient dividend stocks instead of speculative growth plays. They should also ideally invest in firmly profitable companies that trade at multiples that are lower than the S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 17.

Faced with all these challenges many investors might consider taking a closer look at the telecom giant Verizon (VZ 1.38%). But is this blue-chip stalwart really a worthwhile investment right now? Let's review four reasons to buy Verizon -- and one reason to sell it -- to determine if it's a good bear market buy.

1. Its market leadership and scale

Verizon hosted 114.6 million wireless retail connections at the end of the second quarter of 2022 which makes it the largest wireless carrier in the U.S. T-Mobile (TMUS -0.20%) ranked second with 110 million wireless customers in the second quarter followed by AT&T's (T 0.06%) latest tally of 107.3 million wireless subscribers (excluding connected non-handset devices).

Verizon's market leadership and scale arguably make it a more stable investment than its rivals since it can spend less cash on aggressive marketing campaigns or the expansion of its 5G networks.

2. A clearer focus than its two main rivals

Verizon also operates a simpler business model than both AT&T and T-Mobile. While AT&T bit off more than it could chew with the misguided and debt-fueled expansion of its pay TV and media businesses Verizon only took baby steps into the media and digital advertising sector with its smaller acquisitions of Yahoo and AOL. It sold both of those struggling businesses last year.

Verizon also isn't digesting and integrating a massive merger as T-Mobile is still doing with its merger with Sprint from more than two years ago. That mega-merger enabled T-Mobile to surpass AT&T as the country's second-largest carrier but it also caused numerous staffing and customer service issues.

AT&T recently reset its business with its recent spin-offs of DirecTV and WarnerMedia but investors who are looking for a more streamlined telecom play could still gravitate toward Verizon instead of its rivals.

3. Stable earnings growth and a low valuation

Verizon's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) grew 2% in 2019 rose another 2% in 2020 (even as the pandemic curbed its wireless growth) and jumped 10% in 2021 as consumers bought new 5G devices. For the current year Verizon expects its adjusted EPS to decline 3%-5% as its core wireless business faces tougher inflationary and competitive headwinds.

That near-term outlook is disappointing but Verizon's stock already trades at less than nine times forward earnings. That low valuation should limit its downside potential in this value-oriented market.

4. A dependable dividend

Verizon has raised its dividend every year for 15 straight years. It currently pays a forward dividend yield of 5.8% which is nearly double the 10-year Treasury's closely watched yield of 3%. That high yield should make it an attractive investment for income-oriented investors.

The one reason to sell Verizon: AT&T is a better buy

Verizon looks like a good all-around defensive stock but it doesn't hold up well when compared to the ""new"" AT&T. In its latest quarter AT&T predicted that its adjusted EPS would actually grow 0%-2% for the full year even as it faced many of the same inflationary and competitive headwinds as Verizon.

AT&T's stock also looks cheaper than Verizon at a mere seven times forward earnings and it pays a higher forward dividend yield of 6%. AT&T might be trading at a discount to Verizon because some investors doubt it can hit its rosy post-spinoff targets but I believe it looks like a better buy right now.

Verizon isn't worth buying right now

Verizon's business is stable but I believe it will continue to tread water in this market for at least the next few quarters. Its downbeat guidance suggests it could be struggling to fend off AT&T and T-Mobile and its low valuation and high yield can't mask those unfavorable comparisons. So for now investors should avoid Verizon and stick with other cheap dividend stocks to ride out this choppy market.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saWdodHJlYWRpbmcuY29tL3JlZ3VsYXRvcnktcG9saXRpY3MvaGVyZS1zLXdoYXQtdmVyaXpvbi1jb21jYXN0LXQtbW9iaWxlLWFuZC1vdGhlcnMtZG8td2l0aC1jdXN0b21lcnMtbG9jYXRpb24tZGF0YdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's what Verizon Comcast T-Mobile and others do with customers' location data,"FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel on Thursday published the answers she received from all the nation's top mobile service providers about how they handle their customers' location data.

""Our mobile phones know a lot about us"" she said in a statement. ""That means carriers know who we are who we call and where we are at any given moment. This information and geolocation data is really sensitive. It's a record of where we've been and who we are. That's why the FCC is taking steps to ensure this data is protected.""

Rosenworcel also said the FCC's Enforcement Bureau will launch a new investigation into mobile carriers' compliance with FCC rules that require carriers to fully disclose to consumers how they are using and sharing geolocation data.

In their responses providers like Verizon and AT&T argued that they collect location data in order to operate their networks provide 911 services and respond to law enforcement requests for data. Most operators said they keep such data for several years.

Figure 1: (Source: Marcos Alvarado/Alamy Stock Photo)

Several service providers also said they collect location data for marketing programs arguing that customers are able to opt out if they choose. Most also noted that they store customers' location data inside the US.

Service providers said they share location data with some of their vendors but that they do so in controlled circumstances and only when it's required. The providers' full responses are listed here.

Following is some of the most interesting information contained in the top providers' responses:

Comcast

Because Verizon supports Comcast's Xfinity Mobile mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) Comcast ""does not have access to nor does it obtain precise geolocation data ... from Verizon.""

Comcast keeps whatever location information it does have for two years in most cases.

Verizon handles 911 services and law enforcement requests for Xfinity Mobile.

Comcast said subscribers cannot opt out of its data retention policies because it ""retains a limited set of location data for as long as is necessary to provide services and perform the operational functions identified above; it is not used for marketing or advertising and we do not share any Xfinity Mobile location data or Xfinity Wi-Fi location data with third parties for their own purposes.""

Verizon

Verizon said it collects cell site and sector location data to operate its network. The company also said its Verizon-branded applications collect data including telephone numbers and latitude/longitude coordinates. ""However many applications collect less – or none – of this data depending on the specific uses that apps make of location"" according to Verizon.

Verizon also collects location information for its Business and Marketing Insights program. ""For example we may use network location data to develop insights to help estimate traffic patterns during the morning rush hour or how many customers go to a retail store"" Verizon said. ""The information we use and the insights that are developed do not identify customers individually; rather they will show things like the total number of customers that were at a stadium at a given time. Our customers can opt out of this program at any time."" That data is then sold to customers of the program.

Verizon keeps location data for one year but sometimes less in certain circumstances.

""With one limited exception Verizon Wireless stores geolocation data for our consumer customers in the United States. There is limited storage of data associated with one application (Care Smart) in Canada in connection with the Get Help professional monitoring feature"" the carrier explained.

T-Mobile

T-Mobile collects several kinds of location data including ""the current location of a handset to provide the estimated longitude and latitude (and at times elevation and/or street address) of the handset in response to either a customer placing a call or sending a text message to 911"" according to the company.

Its policy ""is not to collect or retain geolocation data for advertising purposes without affirmative customer consent"" the company said. T-Mobile recently launched an advertising business.

T-Mobile keeps geolocation data for up to two years.

""Because opting-out of continued retention could undermine our essential operations we generally do not allow customers to opt-out of the company's retention of geolocation data"" the company said. ""As our privacy notice explains we do allow customers to opt-out of the use of device diagnostic information – including geolocation data – for troubleshooting and network improvement.""

""T-Mobile's practice is not to sell geolocation data to third parties"" the company said.

Mint Mobile

Mint Mobile collects and retains ""minimal"" longitude and latitude data ""for the purposes of (i) determining network availability and quality around the consumer's location (ii) phone number procurement and assignment and (iii) to assist in troubleshooting if a subscriber using the account management app encounters an issue"" according to the company. ""Because the data has not been formatted or extracted into a usable format it is currently fulfilling no other use cases.""

Mint keeps geolocation data for 18 months for both existing and former subscribers.

""Our network provider does NOT disclose tower location information to us"" the company said. ""Our assumption is that law enforcement has the ability to triangulate subscriber location via the combination of information we provide and the information they receive from the network operator."" Mint's service runs on top of T-Mobile's network.

Mint Mobile and its parent company Ultra Mobile said they do not share geolocation data with third parties.

Google Fi

""For Android devices Google Fi's network-switching function which ensures that the device uses the best available network based on the device's location requires that the device process certain types of data–such as device location (GPS and other signals) Cell IDs and MCCs [mobile country codes]"" the company said. ""However this data with the exception of Cell IDs MCCs and IP addresses does not leave the subscriber's device.""

Google said it processes data at Google data centers ""which are decentralized and located in many countries around the world. A Google Fi subscriber's data may be processed (and stored securely) at any of these data centers.""

It can take up to two months and sometimes longer to delete customers' data according to the company.

""Google Fi also shares limited types of data with Google affiliates as needed to: provide Google Fi services; process device purchases; bill and collect payments for Google Fi services and devices; troubleshoot potential issues with Google Fi services devices or the Google Fi account; verify identity; and protect from fraud phishing or other misconduct"" the company said.

Dish Network

For its MVNO-based offerings Dish said it ""neither receives nor obtains geolocation data from the underlying facilities-based carriers that host its MVNO customers.""

""There is no need for subscribers to opt out of the sharing of geolocation data specific to a customer because Dish does not share customer-identifying geolocation data with third parties except as required to comply with a valid and lawful legal process or for network optimization"" Dish said. ""Project Genesis will notify customers of any future sharing of their geolocation information with third parties consistent with applicable law.""

Charter

Charter's Spectrum Mobile service runs on the Verizon network. Charter explained that when a Spectrum Mobile customer connects Verizon sends Spectrum Mobile several types of data including identifying information for the cell sites used to start and end calls or data transmissions and data about international roaming. ""Spectrum Mobile uses this information from Verizon to analyze customer traffic trends for billing and to provide troubleshooting and other customer service in the event of service-related issues. Verizon does not share the locations of specific cell sites or the geolocation of devices with Spectrum Mobile"" the company said.

Charter said it explicitly asks customers for permission to use their geolocation information. ""If a customer opts in to enable location services an embedded Connection Manager (on Android devices) or software in the My Spectrum App or Spectrum TV App (on any device) shares geolocation information with Spectrum Mobile for the purposes of diagnosing connectivity issues and informing network planning and engineering. The information is encrypted and retained for no more than two years in case it is needed for specific troubleshooting reasons. Senior leaders must approve any request and accompanying business purpose to access decrypted geolocation information within the two-year retention period to troubleshoot a specific service issue. After two years geolocation information is aggregated in a way that cannot be tied to an individual user and stored for up to three years for network planning usage analytics and year-over-year comparisons. Spectrum Mobile customers may change their My Spectrum App Spectrum TV App or Connection Manager settings or opt out of location services at any time regardless of their device type.""

The company said it does not sell or share geolocation data with third parties for any purpose including advertising.

""Spectrum Mobile customers do not have the ability to opt out of Charter's overall data retention policies. However customers do have the ability to opt out or manage whether Charter collects geolocation information via their mobile devices or through our mobile applications"" the company said.

AT&T

AT&T said it developed a product called IQI software that is ""embedded in the firmware of Android devices by original equipment manufacturers (""OEMs""). It collects device diagnostic and location data on a passive basis (e.g. when a device powers on or contacts a new cell tower) including latitude/longitude information. AT&T Mobility uses IQI software to improve network performance and for customer service purposes. For example AT&T Mobility uses data derived from IQI software to identify areas where it needs to enhance network coverage. AT&T Mobility does not share IQI data except where legally required nor do we use it for advertising purposes.""

AT&T said it operates a Relevant Advertising business which is an opt-out advertising program and Enhanced Relevant Advertising which is an opt-in advertising program.

Regarding location data AT&T said it keeps some for 13 months or five years depending on the type of data.

""We do not share location data with location aggregators and location-based service providers and we would not share such data with other third parties without our customer's consent"" the carrier said.

Choosing the best router for Verizon FIOS

Why you can trust Windows Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.

Since the official FIOS hardware from Verizon is a tri-band router using the Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) standard it has plenty to offer for speedy internet access including Gigabit LAN and USB ports. Some of the best Wi-Fi 6 routers offer similar specs but the Archer AX90 from TP-Link matches the FIOS router specs as the best overall choice.

If you prefer to spring for an entry-level FIOS package then the dual-band Netgear R6700AX will still provide you with everything you need to enjoy the service. You wouldn't need to be subscribed to the Verizon packages for too long to have saved money overall and you'll still benefit from Wi-Fi 6 functionality."

The $180 million project first announced in 2020 is a 300000 square foot state-of-the-art facility to double the company’s viral vector manufacturing capacity. This marks the company’s sixth viral vector site across the U.S. and Europe.

Thermo Fisher Scientific stated that it expects to add around 300 jobs through the facility which will support the development and commercialization of the company’s gene therapies.

Thermo Fisher Scientific CEO Marc Casper called the Plainville manufacturing facility an “impressive addition” to the company’s pharma services network and a key aspect of its growing investment strategy in the cell and gene therapy value chain.

“We are enabling our customers to speed their scientific discoveries in cell and gene therapy while also supporting their manufacturing needs whether they are early in the development process or ready to transition to clinical or commercial scale” Casper said in a statement.

The facility opening came less than a month after Thermo Fisher Scientific released its most recent quarterly earnings report.

Thermo Fisher Scientific is the latest healthcare organization to expand its presence in Massachusetts.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals announced in May that it planned to increase its presence in Boston with a new 344000 square foot lab facility in the Seaport district. The effort is expected to support Vertex’s growth strategy and expansion of cell and gene therapies research.

Expected to be completed in 2025 Vertex said it expects the new building to house roles for around 500 additional employees.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9ycy5jb20vaWJkLWRhdGEtc3Rvcmllcy9zdG9ja3MtdG8td2F0Y2gtYWdpb3MtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzLXNlZXMtcmVsYXRpdmUtc3RyZW5ndGgtcmF0aW5nLWp1bXAtdG8tODMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stocks To Watch: Agios Pharmaceuticals Sees Relative Strength Rating Jump To 83,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-agios-pharmaceuticals-sees-relative-strength-rating-jump-to-83/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9ycy5jb20vaWJkLWRhdGEtc3Rvcmllcy9zdG9ja3MtdG8td2F0Y2gtYWdpb3MtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzLXNlZXMtcmVsYXRpdmUtc3RyZW5ndGgtcmF0aW5nLWp1bXAtdG8tODMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

The purchase price for the casino operations represents an implied 2021 earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (""EBITDA"") multiple of 4.9x. The multiple excludes any potential cost synergies and operational improvements and deducts annual rent from the VICI lease from EBITDA. The acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to the Company's earnings.

With this acquisition and our pending acquisition of the Nugget Casino Resort in Nevada we will oversee a US portfolio that reaches from east to west"" Erwin Haitzmann and Peter Hoetzinger Co-Chief Executive Officers of Century Casinos remarked.

Rocky Gap Casino Resort had net operating revenue of $78 million and Adjusted EBITDA* of $27 million for the year ended December 31 2021.

The property has recently invested $10 million in improvements to its hotel slot machines restaurants and sports lounge. There is potential to expand the casino and hotel and capture more customers from adjacent markets. Additionally Century will have the opportunity to partner with a sports betting operator in Maryland to bring sports betting to Rocky Gap.

Upon closing of the Rocky Gap acquisition and the pending acquisition of Nugget Sparks LLC (""Nugget"") which operates the Nugget Casino Resort in Sparks NV the Company's North American portfolio will increase to 11 casinos that include 7140 gaming machines and 158 table games. On a pro-forma basis after giving effect to the two acquisitions the Company expects to generate 94% of its Adjusted EBITDA* from its North American casinos.

The transaction is expected to close mid-2023 subject to regulatory and governmental approvals and customary closing conditions.

Stifel acted as exclusive financial advisor and Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP acted as legal counsel to the Company in connection with the acquisition.

*Adjusted EBITDA is a Non-US GAAP financial measure. See discussion and reconciliation of Non-US GAAP financial measures in Supplemental Information below.

Supplemental Information:

The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss) attributable to Century Casinos Inc. shareholders before interest expense (income) net income taxes (benefit) depreciation and amortization non-controlling interests net earnings (loss) and transactions pre-opening expenses acquisition costs non-cash stock-based compensation charges asset impairment costs (gain) loss on disposition of fixed assets discontinued operations (gain) loss on foreign currency transactions cost recovery income and other gain on business combination and certain other one-time transactions. Expense related to the Company's master lease with VICI and the Century Downs Racetrack and Casino land lease is included in the interest expense (income) net line item. Intercompany transactions consisting primarily of management and royalty fees and interest along with their related tax effects are excluded from the presentation of net earnings (loss) attributable to Century Casinos Inc. shareholders and Adjusted EBITDA reported for each segment. Non-cash stock-based compensation expense is presented under Corporate and Other as the expense is not allocated to reportable segments when reviewed by the Company's chief operating decision makers. Not all of the aforementioned items occur in each reporting period but have been included in the definition based on historical activity. These adjustments have no effect on the consolidated results as reported under US GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is not considered a measure of performance recognized under US GAAP. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a valuable measure of the relative performance of the Company and its properties. The gaming industry commonly uses Adjusted EBITDA as a method of arriving at the economic value of a casino operation. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to compare the relative operating performance of separate operating units by eliminating the above-mentioned items associated with the varying levels of capital expenditures for infrastructure required to generate revenue and the often high cost of acquiring existing operations. Adjusted EBITDA is used by the Company to gauge operating performance. The Company's computation of Adjusted EBITDA may be different from and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies within the gaming industry.

She has a wild suspicion about Taylor Hayes and while it sounds out there is she right?

B&B Spoilers Highlights

It’s the Logans versus the Forresters once again. Or more specifically it’s Logan against the Forresters and a Hayes. Brooke (Katherine Kelly Lang) isn’t happy about all that’s happening in her marriage her daughter’s household and her family in general. Not only does she know Taylor is after Ridge Forrester (Thorsten Kaye) but she highly suspects she’s using Douglas Forrester (Django Ferri) to get him!

Bold and Beautiful: It’s All A Scheme

Oh yes. She rants to Hope Logan Spencer (Annika Noelle) about the whole situation. She truly believes Taylor is using all the drama surrounding Thomas Forrester (Matthew Atkinson). Think about it the more animosity Taylor can help create the better her chances of busting up the marriage right?

This couldn’t possibly be just a case of a mother supporting her son in his pursuit to be a better father and a good man. Taylor may make it seem like that but Brooke knows better. And let’s not forget Brooke is usually right on the money about everything and everyone. Take heed people. She may be onto something.

Meanwhile Deacon Sharpe (Sean Kanan) finds himself between a rock and a hard…place. His mind despises Sheila Carter (Kimberlin Brown) but his body sure doesn’t. She duped him into bed the first time but now he can’t seem to stay away.

Is he falling for her? That’s debatable. Is he hot for her? Absolutely. She’s the devil but as crazy as she is outside of the pull-out couch she’s even crazier when she gets under the sheets. Who could resist?

(Reuters) - Payments giant Visa Inc said on Wednesday it has issued over 4 billion network tokens worldwide through its security technology Visa Token Service (VTS) outpacing the total number of its physical cards in circulation.

VTS replaces 16-digit Visa account numbers with a token that only Visa can unlock protecting the underlying account information.

""Without exposing the consumer's account to fraud tokenization enables frictionless card-free payments"" Jack Forestell executive vice president and chief product officer at Visa told Reuters.

The popularity of the service driven by its promise of safer online transactions corresponds with the surge in online spending since the global outbreak of COVID-19.

E-commerce volume has grown by more than 50% since the onset of the pandemic the world's largest payments processor said in a statement citing data from the U.S. Department of Commerce.

Since launching VTS in 2014 Visa said it had issued 1 billion tokens by 2020 after which growth accelerated to 2 billion in 2021 before doubling this year.

The demand is not likely to ebb with most consumers retaining the lockdown habit of swiping cards online and helped by ongoing investments from companies in making shopping on digital platforms more secure and user friendly.

""E-commerce is now happening everywhere. Online happens in-store as merchants look to provide more options for consumers. In-store your phone can also be your Visa card"" Forestell added.

VTS compatible with popular apps such as Alphabet Inc's Google Pay and Apple Pay runs as a payments security platform offering different solutions for retail consumers as well as institutions like banks and clearing houses.

Late in July Visa reported quarterly profit that sailed past Wall Street estimates on the back of resilient consumer spending that has so far been undeterred by red-hot inflation as well as a summer travel boom across much of the U.S.

This historic milestone which nearly doubled Visa’s token count in one year surpasses the number of physical Visa cards in circulation worldwide. This milestone underscores the powerful security that tokens provide to merchants issuers and consumers alike.

“Tokenization is a simple yet powerful concept pioneered by Visa: conceal and devalue sensitive payment data to stay ahead of fraudsters and make digital payments more secure” said Jack Forestell executive vice president and chief product officer at Visa. “The uptick in issuers acquirers merchants and consumers all transacting with Visa tokens reinforces that the future of money is truly digital and digital money must be built on trust.”

E-commerce volume has grown by more than 50 percent1 since the onset of the pandemic. But with the convenience of online shopping comes increased consumer expectations and demand for simple and safe transactions. Visa is innovating ahead of consumer demand through Visa Token Service which replaces 16-digit Visa account numbers with a digital token only Visa can unlock helping to protect the underlying account information from fraudsters and bad actors.

Tokens: The Security Guards of Online Shopping

Tokens are the unsung heroes of ecommerce which the entire payments ecosystem can benefit from with issuers acquirers merchants and consumers all seeing a range of benefits including reduced fraud ease of use across devices and more.

Visa analysis shows that across more than 8600 issuers and 800000 merchants Visa tokens have led to a 28 percent reduction in fraud rates and a 3 percent increase in approval rates – increasing sales for merchants while saving them money on fraud-related expenses.

The Future of Authentication Anchored by Tokens

In an age where most of our financial lives exist in the cloud advanced technology helps ensure customer data is protected wherever transactions take place. Authentication 2.0 – the future of consumer protection – is anchored by tokens and tools such as Visa’s Cloud Token Framework (CTF) which is designed to enhance security and increase approval rates for card-not-present transactions across multiple payment experiences and devices.

“This milestone is indicative of the continued investment Visa is making in safe reliable and seamless transactions around the globe” said Forestell. “Continued adoption of tokenization will help enable Visa’s mission of helping individuals businesses and economies thrive.”

The goal is to empower smaller financial organizations that have lacked the budgets or capabilities to deliver high-tech digital tools. ""Our platform opens the door for who can get in the game so now all you need is a will and there's a way"" co-founder and CEO Joseph Akintolayo told Dallas Innovates.

Joseph Akintolayo says the will exists for organizations to provide more digital financial tools to their communities. But due to either a lack of technological knowhow or tight budgets they often lack the means.

Now with $5 million in fresh funding Deposits—the Dallas-based startup Akintolayo leads—is looking to offer plug-and-play banking features for community banks credit unions and other financial brands to reach more people.

“Financial services have always been a relationship business. It’s about trust it’s about relationships. It hasn’t really been about technology until recently” Akintolayo Deposits’ CEO told Dallas Innovates. “The center of gravity changed and it presented us with an opportunity to fill this big gap.”

‘We handle all of the financial innovation’

Akintolayo co-founded Deposits in 2019 alongside COO Daniel Paramo after noticing that bigger players in the financial industry had a technological advantage over others. He also saw that many of the digital tools being developed in the financial tech space were being created for companies that already had large budgets.

With Deposits the two co-founders aim to level the playing field by making it easier for organizations to offer financial features. Through the company’s platform Deposits offers what Akintolayo calls “kits”—thematic financial experiences built around common financial services customers are looking for: like money management mobile payments business banking and payroll.

“We provide a set of templates and composable elements that you can use to turn into your own experience. Kind of like Shopify Squarespace or Wix” Akintolayo said. “Our job is to pay attention to consumer expectations to be as product-driven and product-led as possible. We handle all of the financial innovation all the technology so no one else has to.”

Already working with Visa Mastercard and Blue Ridge Bank

Akintolayo said Deposits’ goal is to help drive inclusivity by making digital financial solutions more accessible to those that have been historically underbanked—and to make it easier for organizations to reach them. He says Deposts does this in a streamlined way to create immediate value.

The company is already working with a number of partners including Visa Mastercard and Blue Ridge Bank.

“The impact looks like saving some financial institutions from extinction; the impact looks like getting financial inclusion closer to communities” Akintolayo said.

‘This funding is all about expanding access to financial services’

Deposits’ seed funding round was led by Austin-based early-stage venture capital firm ATX Venture Partners and joined by Cabal Fund and Lightspeed Venture Partners. With the new funding Akintolayo said his company will build out its platform and add new services like lending to its platform while building out its 27-person team.

Akintolayo said his team’s growth will be determined by demand. Currently the company’s website lists 25 locally based and remote open positions in areas including product engineering and sales.

“This funding is all about expanding access to financial services” Akintolayo said. “We plan to really fill that gap that remains unaddressed by the legacy banking service providers. Our platform opens the door for who can get in the game so now all you need is a will and there’s a way. There’s still a lot of demand for embedded financial services and there’s a big gap that’s yet to be filled.”

By Benjamin Flowers: The Gales Point Manatee Village Council is calling on Belizeans to support the preservation of the ecological diversity of the community by signing a petition aimed at ensuring that the company Vulcan Materials can not conduct strip mining activities in the area.

The council has set out to gather 5000 signatures with urgency as the company is making strides towards getting the necessary approval to begin mining. The council explained that Vulcan Materials operating in Belize as Caracol Holdings has a contingency contract to purchase over 14000 acres from White Ridge Farms in an area located between two existing reserve areas: Gales Point Wildlife Sanctuary and the Manatee Forrest Reserve.

The council stresses that this area is home to over 100 species of birds all of Belize’s National Symbols including Baird’s Tapir Keel Billed Toucan Mahogany Black Orchid as well as every species of wild cat endemic to Belize. The shoreline in question is part of the largest Sea Turtle nesting grounds in the region.

“The Environmental Impact of strip mining here would be devastation in an area where some of the world’s most critically endangered species are surviving.” the council said.

“The operations would include a conveyor belt cutting across Sea Turtle nesting beach and dredging to allow for loading their cargo ships.”

The council added that apart from the irreparable environmental damage bringing mining into the area would disrupt any development that would occur naturally due to rehabilitation of the Coastal Road and would not provide any economic benefit for the community as locals would not qualify for the majority of the jobs that would be made available when the mine is operational.

Notably there are reportedly other buyers interested in the area that the council says intends to build a hospital for medical tourism which will be of little environmental impact but will bring economic gains to the community.

“I can tell you that the position is that unequivocally that this may not be an investment that has the support of the government so we will have to communicate to them the position as it relates to that investment” said Kenrick Williams the chief executive officer in the Ministry of Sustainable Development.”

The company is in the process of acquiring several hundred acres of land off the Coastal Road near Gales Point Manatee in an area called White Ridge Farms.

But the villagers have overwhelmingly rejected the company’s project proposal in fear of irreversible environmental damage that preparatory work will bring.

They believe for example turning a hill into rocks and stones means explosives will have to be used to blast the hill and that will kill and displace all the wildlife in the area.

Officials from the Vulcan Materials Company are due to meet with personnel from the Ministry of Sustainable Development later this week.

But Williams says while there have not been any formal proposals from the company just a request for a preliminary meeting the company’s past projects are of concern to the government.

“They want an environmental impact assessment (EIA). We’ve not commenced any process. They would like to present to us the idea that they would like to develop in this area. So we’ve not initiated any process as it relates to the EIA” said Williams.

“We’ve not received any formal indication or request for the conducting of an EIA. It’s all what is really floating out there in the media again save for an expressed interest to have a discussion with us about this project because of the public backlash in the initial concept stage.”

Williams said that the authorities have done the research and some initial analysis as to the investments being made by this company in other jurisdictions the impact being caused by mining. “We’re not the experts on mining that is the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Mining Department specifically and their part of the NEAC they would inform us as it relates to the specificity of that process.

“We also do not want to prejudice any investment so any investment that is being made there is a legal process that they go through that they will indicate to us from their research and analysis and their projections these are the potential impacts as it relates to these developments” Williams added.

The Vulcan Materials Company is the nation’s largest producer of construction aggregates primarily crushed stone sand and gravel and a major producer of other construction materials including asphalt and ready-mixed concrete.

You've heard the residents declare that they are vehemently against the company coming in and effectively destroying their natural environment - which has remained pristine over the years. You've also heard the Minister of Natural Resources say that there's no way Vulcan will be getting permission from the government to mine in that area even if they go ahead with the purchasing of the land. Well today we asked the prime minister for his take on it. While he wasn't as definitive as Minister Hyde he did say he doesn't think the Cabinet will approve the permits. Hon. John Briceno Prime Minister

""Well it's a it's a basic right. Anybody can can come and buy land once the owner is prepared to to sell now whether they would get the necessary approvals that's another matter.

And certainly myself as a former Minister of Environment I would not I don't think it's something I would take lightly or kindly to see that this beautiful mountain just just be destroyed. But we cannot stop any company that wants to come and invest in Belize. We need to hear them out. You know we can't just say well don't come we want them to come. But they have to follow our laws and especially our environmental laws because we are known as an eco friendly country. And as such we're going to do everything possible to protect that reputation that we have worldwide."" Courtney Menzies:

""So while in the minister's mind he might say outright no you're saying let's talk to them let's hear them out first before we just go to no."" Hon. John Briceno Prime Minister

""No I don't know where you get that. I never said I never said no such thing. I never said no such thing. What I said is that it has not come to the Cabinet. At the end of the day it will have to come to cabinet. They would have to make certain applications. He has said that he would not support it. I am saying that I will support the protection of the environment. The area representative had said that she would not support it but I can't give a definitive answer because it has not come to committee. I believe that the Cabinet will not support it but until that time comes then we could get a definitive answer."" Later on in the interview the Prime Minister said quote ""I do not supportâ€¦but if someone wants to come in and explore an investment opportunity in the country they have that right.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBpdGFuZHF1YXJyeS5jb20vZHJpbGxpbmctaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi1hbGxvd3MtZm9yLWhhbmRzLWZyZWUtYml0LWNoYW5nZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Drilling innovation allows for hands-free bit changes,"Epiroc introduced an automatic bit changer for hands-free bit changes on Pit Viper 270 and Pit Viper 290 series drill rigs used in rotary drilling.

The automatic bit changer option is designed to change rotary tricone bits significantly faster than manual exchanges Epiroc says eliminating human interaction with drill string for safer more efficient operation.

According to Epiroc operators can do bit changes with a single touch of a button and stay informed on their screen. Operators can make or break joints select drill bits and add or remove them. Bit changes can be done either from a control room or from the cab.

“The early collaboration with customers and cross-functional teams resulted in an auto bit changer that is repeatable keeps the operator out of the line of fire and improves machine uptime” says Matthew Fosler senior design engineer of Epiroc’s surface division.

A carousel design allows up to four bits to be changed significantly faster and safer than a single manual exchange Epiroc adds. The removable bit carousel can store rotary tricone bits in varying sizes and cutting structure.

The automatic bit changer is available for new drills and retrofit of drills already in the field the company adds.

“Through its development and trial the automatic bit changer has proven to be the safest and most efficient way to change bits that is currently available” says Carla Chaname product manager of automation for Epiroc’s surface division.",,,

The city’s planning commission approved a site plan for the restaurant’s expansion of the parking lot on Eaton Street and construction of a second lot on Oxford — addressing a decade of homeowner complaints about Vinsetta customers parking on their streets to get to the popular restaurant.

""There were times we had to park all the way down there just because there were so many Vinsetta guests lining our street"" said resident Lauren Bonofiglio.

""If it takes the parking off of our street that’s fine but I want to make sure that it is landscaped that it looks professional that it looks nice that we have some type of enclosure - and it’s not just a big messy overgrown lot"" said resident Nicki Sanom.

The vote to approve the site plan included conditions to address residents' concerns about the parking lots — which will have 28 spaces on Eaton and 26 on Oxford.

""In addition to that it included provisions that there had to be screen walls masonry screen walls to match the brick at Vinsetta"" said Kristen Kapelanski. ""There also had to be some landscape components included as well.""

Kapelanski the Berkley community development director says the city walked a tight rope in addressing the concerns of homeowners and the demands of the restaurant.

The city approved a consent agreement with the Vinsetta after it sued Berkley to demolish some nearby homes it bought to make way for the parking lots.

""We realize this is not a perfect solution for any of the parties involved but we do feel the city has come to the best compromise for all those interested parties"" Kapelanski said.

Vinsetta Garage co-owner Curt Catallo says the parking lot plan has always been the best forward and they’re going above and beyond what’s required for them.

""If you look at a city's ordinances their parking lot ordinances are designed to make sure people's headlights are not protruding past a wall or that the lights are too bright"" Catallo said. ""And in our case our walls are going to be higher than the ordinance our lights are going to be lower in output than the ordinance all to make sure we’re not disruptive to the neighborhood.

""I think at the end of the day we’re going to have a parking lot that if it’s any more attractive people will just get carry-out and eat in their cars because it’s going to be an attractive lot and the city is going to hold us to that.""

After battling with the city and its residents for a decade Vinsetta Garage a popular restaurant and bar on Woodward Avenue in Berkley finally got its way.

The Berkley Planning Commission on Tuesday voted 4-2 to approve a site plan for two parking lots -- one on Oxford and another on Eaton in a residential area behind the restaurant reports Bill Laitner of the Detroit Free Press. The approval was based on a consent agreement signed by the city and Union Joints a restaurant group that owns the business.

People in the immediate neighborhood have complained of customers parking on their streets and making noise late into the night. Some remain concerned about the new lots.

Conversely customers have complained of a shortage of parking and have sometimes been the target of unfriendly comments from irritated residents.

Wheelsets come in all types and sizes − large small solid; with tyres and without; powered trailer; inside bearings outside bearings; and sometimes as individual wheels. Wheels are the heaviest and probably the most expensive consumable parts on trains and they are safety critical parts; although there are many wheelsets on a train each is a single point failure risk and wheels/axles rarely fail safe. Degradation can happen through wear but serious flat spots or cracks leading to fractures can and do lead to derailment.

The railway industry rightly focusses on continuously improving wheelset safety and management. Its work is led by the RSSB sponsored Wheelset Management Group (see panel). For many years the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE) has held wheelset seminars to share developments and issues. The most recent event was held at the Institution’s Westminster HQ in April 2022. This article reports on a selection of the presentations.

The keynote speaker Bridget Eickhoff principal infrastructure engineer at RSSB has had a long career in vehicle dynamics. She highlighted the challenges still facing wheelsets some 200 years after the principle of coned wheels fixed to an axle was first proposed by George Stephenson. As well as the single point failure risk mentioned above they operate in an extremely harsh environment (accelerations >80 g are often measured) and they represent a large proportion of fleet maintenance cost. Each area of the industry (tram/light rail passenger freight high speed etc.) has its own issues and challenges. Finally as heavy consumable items there is an environmental challenge with the embedded carbon in the steel.

Wheelsets support the vehicle mass steer the vehicle along the track roll with minimum resistance transmit all braking and traction forces and support brake discs and transmission components without wearing out rails unnecessarily. They do all this through a contact patch that is approximately the area of a five pence coin. Bridget said that the contact pressures are extremely high and much higher than any other rolling contact application.

Wheelset (blue) and other bogie component (turquoise) monitoring opportunities.

Remote monitoring

Using the principle of what gets measured can be managed there were two presentations about wheelset measurement. Dr Martin Rosenberger head of vehicle dynamics acoustics and analytics at Siemens Mobility Austria talked about digitisation in wheelset maintenance. He said that his objective was to move from corrective and preventive maintenance towards condition-based and predictive maintenance operations with the aim of delivering better availability reduced life cycle cost improved safety longer life span of components and reduced environmental impact.

Wheelset maintenance tasks include inspection reprofiling and exchange. The adjacent diagram highlights the wheelset parameters (in turquoise) and other influencing components (in blue). The objective of inspection (data acquisition) is to indicate the health status of the various components and their remaining useful life both of which are used to plan workshop activity. The digitisation process is aimed at automating all these tasks. Martin highlighted three levels: Acquisition level – including wayside vehicle measurement systems on board diagnostics and wheel lathe measurements; Execution level including – a computerised maintenance management system and management dashboards; and finally Strategic level – digital twin; and the core element for a digital system an Internet of Things platform connecting all different levels and tools.

Wayside systems can measure most wheelset parameters: profile diameter flange height and thickness back-to-back and tread defects including flats spalling radial runout. These devices are often located on the entry/exit of depots.

Typical wayside wheelset monitoring system

On board systems typically use accelerometers and speed sensors to identify wheel flats out of roundness wheel diameter wheel profile parameters and axle gearbox and motor bearing issues. If these sensors are connected to the train’s computer systems with Wi-Fi/4G communications data and/or alerts may be sent continuously.

For the Internet of Things data platform Martin stressed the importance of an “open ecosystem” to allow data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats to be integrated to enable “advanced analytics and decision making”. He said that this information would be input into the maintenance logistics planning and management system with the automatic generation of work orders. Martin also demonstrated sample health status screens from Siemens Railigent® software. His final slide highlighted this system already in use in Siemens depots for the 115 class 700 Thameslink trains.

Wheelset load monitoring

A new decision tool for condition-based maintenance of wheelsets was demonstrated by Steven Cervello innovation and design manager for Lucchini RS Italy. Axle non-destructive testing is often mandated at fixed intervals of either time or distance but the actual loads experienced by wheelsets vary by route. A straight flat route will tend to have lower loads than routes with significant curves and/or gradients. Steven introduced Smartset® an instrumented wheelset that collects loads which are used to calculate crack propagation rates and hence estimate appropriate NDT intervals.

Smartset comprises three main components: strain gauges to measure bending and torsion stress in the axle; a telemetry module to send the signals by Wi-Fi to a carbody mounted data unit; and an electro-magnetic inductive power supply to provide energy to the electronics (for freight vehicles with no built in power supply an axle end generator may be fitted). The data allows engineers to carry out stress frequency analysis.

Steven demonstrated that on a mountainous route there were significantly more stress cycles in the medium-high range than for the same train running on a flat coastal route influencing the optimal inspection interval. He also showed that the information combined with GPS signals allows engineers to identify locations where loads were higher than usual (often associated with switches and crossings) and to monitor them to detect potential track deterioration over time. Once the impact on the axles is understood engineers are able to identify the appropriate NDT intervals for that fleet something that can be kept under review as service patterns change over time.

Steven said that the system should be fitted to both trailer and motor wheelsets. In response to questions he said that generally only one of each is required to be fitted on a given fleet/route as the objective is to characterise the route rather than continuously monitor every wheelset.

Wheelsets for Very Light Rail (VLR)

Adrian Howson chief technical officer at Transport Design International (TDI) described the Revolution VLR vehicle which was covered in issue 193 (November/December 2021) before focussing on the bogie and wheelset design.

The aim of the RVLR design was to be light weight so that the cost of the track and other infrastructure as well as the propulsion energy might be reduced. When the prototype vehicle was commissioned Adrian’s team thought “where can we get two bogies for our prototype?” Having considered bogies from scrap Manchester trams which were “too challenging to clean up and adapt” TDI’s research identified that freight bogies were often made in small numbers and could be motorised. The DB Axiom (part of Wabtec) LN25 bogie was selected. Adrian said: “In hindsight we chose well for our principal application – a rugged proven bogie perfect for sub-optimal track on restored lines – and we are now getting enquiries for the powered bogie for many other applications such as electric freight”.

Components of the RVLR drive train.

To use the Wabtec LN25 bogie TDI needed to make a number of changes which included reducing the wheel size to reduce the height developing a drive train and having the masses and fixings approved by Wabtec.

Wabtec was also asked to configure the suspension for optimum comfort. To reduce the bogie mass TDI removed the standard freight brakes installed hollow axles used smaller 720mm diameter wheels fitted lightweight axial-flux automotive motors on a suspension mount and added carbon fibre drive shafts and aluminium brackets. The unsprung mass of the freight wheelset (1086kg) was reduced to 967kg in this version including the gearbox. Overall the fully motorised bogie still weighs less than the original freight bogie by some 140kg.

No brakes? Don’t worry!

There are no brakes on the wheelsets as the RVLR uses its traction motors to brake the vehicle to stationary and the brake disc adjacent to the motor is a parking (and emergency) brake spring applied and electrically released. This approach saves considerably on weight and maintenance. Adrian added that magnetic track brakes could be added for routes which operate by line of sight.

Revolution VLR Prototype.

Adrian addressed the track-wear impact of smaller wheels compared to a class 153 vehicle. This is approximately the same capacity as the RVLR weighs 55% more and has 840mm diameter wheels. RVLR has a lower wheel load to diameter ratio and the peak stress on the wheel is some 27% lower than that of the class 153. Adrian said that RVLR has delivered “best in class” low weight meaning low wheel loads for reduced wear – despite the smaller diameter – and low track cost ideal for restoration and line reopening.

Steering bogies – extending wheel life

Liebherr Controlled Active (LiCAS) a smart axle steering solution for existing rail bogies was presented by Rob Wheeler director sales and customer Service UK & Scandinavia and Ivo Kovacic systems engineer for hydraulic applications both from Liebherr-Transportation Systems. The principle of this system is that diagonally opposite wheel bearings are moved towards or away from the bogie transom under hydraulic power in response to a carbody/bogie rotation sensor. The principal aim was to develop an actuator that could be retrofitted to bogies with radial arm primary suspension in place of the radial arm bush.

The actuator delivers longitudinal movement of +/-15 mm and lateral movement of +/- 5 mm. The maximum longitudinal force is +/- 45 kN. Simulations have demonstrated improvements in each of the following parameters: angle of attack T-gamma track shifting force rolling resistance the lateral force of the wheel flange on the rail (Y) and the ratio of this to the vertical wheel load (Q) known as Y/Q. The steering was able to work down to a radius of 200 metres and a 30% to 50% reduction in wheel maintenance cost was forecast.

Modified LN25 motor bogie under prototype RVLR vehicle.

The actuators were fitted to a BT10 bogie on a withdrawn mk3 carriage and tests were performed on the Weardale Railway in County Durham. Eighty-one test runs with different control settings were carried out including 10 combinations of control settings with five steering factors and five failure modes: passive mode curve detection actuator position detection leakage and fault control. The failure modes were tested to ensure there was no risk of derailment even with adverse actuator positions. The track included: high track and curvature irregularities variation of rail head geometry low adhesion (high humidity rainfall) and cant excess (low speed).

The tests were carried out successfully. LiCAS worked as expected. A significant reduction of angle of attack and T-gamma was demonstrated. The tests also validated the simulations and a significant reduction of track access charges was forecast. Finally the LiCAS system was able to be classified as fail-safe for the BT10 bogie.

Sustainability

A new topic at the IMechE Wheelset seminar was a presentation about the sustainability of wheelset manufacture. There is a great deal of embedded carbon in wheelsets and a modern train is likely to use at least four sets of wheels and several brake discs during its life. The presentation ‘Energy Impact of Wheelset Component Manufacture’ had been prepared by Moira Trimarco CSR Manager Lucchini RS and was delivered by Steven Cervello.

Lucchini is a global company with over 2000 employees an annual turnover of over €400 million and nearly 800 clients in 45 countries. Railway production includes circa 250000 wheels 40000 axles and 12000 completed wheelsets per annum.

Steel is eminently recyclable but unlike with inkjet printer cartridges it is impractical to include a pre-paid envelope to return scrap wheels! Although some scrap wheels do get recycled by Lucchini the overwhelming majority of raw material used is other scrap steel. Steven emphasised The Lucchini way: Reduce Re-use Recycle. Reduce raw material energy and waste; Re-use scrap and water; and Recycle machining scrap scrap wheels and axles.

Steel production is energy intensive and Lucchini generates 0.76 tonnes of CO2 eq per tonne of steel produced. That said this value is much better than is usual in the steel sector (up to 1.9-2.0 tonnes of CO2 eq per tonne of steel). Most importantly Lucchini invested in electric arc furnaces which already have the potential to use electricity from renewable sources (currently 40%). This has allowed Lucchini to reduce its emissions by over 3800 tonnes of CO2 eq emissions during the past 2 years.

Lucchini are focussing on reducing the energy needed and hence the carbon emissions at every other stage of the production process. Eighty-eight percent of the energy was used in steel making (59%) and machining (29%). Machining is also of course powered by electricity with the opportunity to use renewable sources.

All this is part of Lucchini’s GREEN ID; a methodology to report the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the product’s lifecycle (cradle to grave – or cradle to cradle to emphasis recycling) in accordance with ISO 14067 Carbon footprint of products – Requirements and guidelines for quantification. Lucchini divided the entire process into three main steps: Upstream (raw material packaging transport); Core (manufacturing maintenance waste transport to customer); and Downstream (Periodic maintenance product end of life). Steven added that the customer can receive a kind of identity card where the total carbon footprint associated to the entire life of the products is expressed in kilograms CO2 eq.

The final big opportunity is in the hands of users. Steven showed a graph showing the average life of a wheel made from Lucchini’s SuperLos steel. This showed an approximately 90 % improvement compared with standard steel which might roughly halve the number of wheels required during a train’s life.

Axle non-destructive examination

The final presentation of the day ‘Towards the Obsolescence of In-Service Ultrasonic Axle Testing’ was given by Roger Deuce principal specialist & technical manager wheelsets at Alstom.

Examining axles using ultrasonic non-destructive examination (NDE) looking for defects that could lead to a crack or a fracture is part of the in-service maintenance regime for most axles in the UK. Given the improvements in the steel making processes product quality assessment measures and the use of modern-day robust design philosophies confirmed indications from these in-service axle inspections have become rare. Comments from the floor suggested that the main reason for scrapping axles was actually as a result of defects in wheelsets caused by fitting or removing wheels.

Roger recollected the origins of many of today’s NDE requirements citing a Railway Inspectorate report into a derailment caused by a broken axle on a 1949 Shenfield Type electric multiple unit on 13 December 1963. The report recommended that “no axle should be tested less frequently than once in every 18 months”. A later accident caused by a broken axle on a freight wagon on 8 March 1996 at Rickerscote recommended amongst other things: improved axle surface preparation; better protective coatings and coating maintenance; a review of NDE frequencies and methods; consideration of theoretical predictions of crack propagation; consideration of the use of MPI in addition to ultrasonic inspection; and a review of overseas experience with NDE techniques and axle coatings.

Lucchini’s Italian factory.

These two reports together with the learning from two other significant events in Germany (2002 and 2008) and one in Italy (2009) have significantly influenced many of today’s axle NDE standards. The current EN15313:2016 and RIS-2766-RST (2017) standards clearly require the definition of an NDE regime (e.g. MPI or ultrasonic inspection). This must include where appropriate the required activities at overhaul as well as in-service between two overhauls. As a minimum the regime must be verified to ensure that if a defect in the axle is just below the detectable size then it will not grow to failure before the subsequent inspection.

Roger described the process by which the technical expert might assess the maintenance regime required including load/stress levels in the axle the ability of the inspection method to detect cracks the allowable size of crack to ensure no failure before the next inspection and the risk of false alarms. Justifying extensions of time are somewhat easier with hollow axles as the entire outer surface can be examined using ultrasonic probes running along the entire inner surface of the axle bore therefore enabling a higher detection sensitivity due to the reduced scanning distance.

It is more challenging to justify extensions if solid axles are retained but a similar assessment process can be used. However there are now modern computer-aided ultrasonic inspection processes available using phased array scanning which can provide new opportunities for solid axles.

Wheelsets for Alstom FLEXX Eco Aventra Bogies.

Other techniques available include redesigning the axle to reduce working stresses as well as potential material techniques such as induction hardening cold rolling and as Roger said “avoiding exotic material grades”.

Roger concluded by showing a photograph of a series of axles intended for Alstom FLEXX Eco bogies destined for use under Alstom’s Aventra EMUs by the use of hollow axles and by designing the axle with reduced working stresses Alstom has been successful in achieving a key industry goal of no longer requiring in-service ultrasonic inspection.

Once again this seminar demonstrated that there is a lot of innovation under way to improve safety and performance whilst reducing cost.

Sam Walton used to say “Give customers what they want and a little more.” This is our ambition with Walmart+ — to offer a suite of benefits and services that are additive for our members. And as the needs of our members evolve we evolve right alongside them. Because a relentless focus on ‘a little more’ is our path to unlocking exponential value.

We know our customers and members are mindfully managing their budgets these days. That’s why we’re excited to introduce a new member perk that delivers compounding value: Walmart Rewards.

Walmart Rewards is a new and easy way for Walmart+ members to earn additional savings toward future Walmart purchases. Let’s say after a few shopping trips or online orders a member has accumulated $10 in Walmart Rewards. When they apply those savings at checkout what was previously a $25 basket now only costs $15.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzgvMjUvMjMzMTg2OTEvd2FsbWFydC1pbi1ob21lLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LW15cS1nYXJhZ2UtZG9vci1vcGVuZXJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walmart can now put your groceries in your garage with a myQ smart garage door opener,"Walmart is expanding its Walmart Plus InHome program adding Chamberlain’s myQ smart garage door controller technology to its list of in-home / in-garage delivery partners. Starting in September Walmart Plus InHome delivery customers can have their groceries securely delivered into their garage if they have a myQ smart garage door controller. And if they don’t have one the company will install one for free.

Chamberlain myQ was a launch partner for Amazon’s in-garage delivery service Amazon Key and still works with that program.

With the myQ integration the Walmart delivery person gets one-time access to the garage via a myQ-connected device such as a myQ smart garage control hub or a myQ smart garage door opener. You don’t share any codes or apps and the delivery person will close the door when they leave.

The Walmart Plus service costs $12.95 a month / $98 a year and unlimited InHome delivery is an extra $7 a month or $40 per year $138 annually for both. The delivery person can also pick up any returns.

As part of the partnership myQ is offering a free “technology upgrade” to make any garage door compatible with the delivery. According to Chamberlain both new and existing subscribers to Walmart Plus InHome are eligible for a free installation of a myQ smart garage control hub (which regularly costs $29.99).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDVhdGxhbnRhLmNvbS9uZXdzL3BlYWNodHJlZS1jaXR5LXdhbG1hcnQtZmlyZdIBQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDVhdGxhbnRhLmNvbS9uZXdzL3BlYWNodHJlZS1jaXR5LXdhbG1hcnQtZmlyZS5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Peachtree City Walmart fire: Videos may help investigators determine cause,"Video taken by a customer at the Walmart in Peachtree City shows the moments after a fire started inside the store. It sparked a 4-alarm response by firefighters on Wednesday evening.

Officials say firefighters responded around 7:20 p.m. to a report of a fire at 2717 Georgia Highway 54. Another alert was given to firefighters when the sprinklers went off in an attempt to begin to suppress the blaze.

Peachtree City police officers were the first at the scene. They went into the building to see if they were able to put out the fire but were overcome by smoke. Some of those officers had to be taken to the hospital. It was not immediately known how many or how severe their smoke inhalation was.

Firefighters arrived soon after to find a rack of merchandise on a back row of the store ablaze. The flames at that point had been licking at the roof for a few minutes and had begun to make it unstable.

""While fighting the fire with a large amount of water they report the structural members from the roof began to collapse on them so the decision was made to back out and the incident commander made the decision to go defensive and fight the fire from the outside of the building"" said Peachtree City Fire Department Assistant Chief Wil Harbin.

Eventually a portion of the roof collapsed.

Meanwhile crews worked to ensure the structure was completely evacuated before firefighters also pulled out due to the danger.

Some social media posts show the fire burning inside the store and employees evacuating customers.

FOX 5 viewers reported seeing thick black smoke coming from the area and which could be seen for miles away.

FFirefighters from surrounding areas including Fayette Fayette County Newnan and Coweta County were asked to respond and assist.

Many firefighters were seen having to go into rehab because of the intensive heat of the late Georgia summer.

It took crews well into the evening to get the fire under control and eventually out. Firefighters were hitting hot spots well into the evening.

There were no reports of injuries among the staff or customers in the store.

The full extent of the damage was not immediately known.

Officials were asking drivers to avoid the area for the rest of Wednesday evening. All lanes along Highway 54 at Planterra Way and the Walmart entrance were shutdown to allow firefighters access. Police were directing eastbound traffic into Peachtree City off Hwy. 54 at Macduff Parkway to Senoia Rd. and back to Hwy. 54. Westbound traffic out of Peachtree City was being rerouted Highway 74 to Senoia Rd. to Macduff to Highway 54 west.

Arson investigators did respond to the scene but the cause of the blaze was still under investigation.

Public safety officials are asking the public's help with the investigation. They are asking anyone who may have seen something at the Walmart ot reach out to Peachtree City Police Sgt.

(WAFF) - A pedestrian was hit and killed in the parking lot of the Walmart Neighborhood Market on 6th Avenue in Decatur.

Irene Cardenas-Martinez with the Decatur Police Department says officers responded to the incident at approximately 9 p.m. on Aug. 25. At the scene officers arrested 33-year-old Preston Nelson on the charge of murder according to online court documents.

According to the Decatur Police Nelson parked in a handicap spot near the store’s entrance and waited until Sherry Sain came out. Once Sain was behind Nelson’s car he reversed pinning Sain between his Mercury Grand Marquis LS and another car.

According to a criminal complaint Nelson attempted to flee the scene but was stopped by a civilian that is when Nelson’s vehicle stalled. Sain was pronounced dead on the scene.

Nelson was booked into the Morgan County jail on a $500000 bond.

Amy Brown says she saw a driver hit and ultimately kill a woman.

Brown said she was leaving Walmart with her young son when she saw a car slowly backing out of a parking spot. She said he started to speed up and pinned a woman between his car and another one. She then saw him drive away leaving this woman’s lifeless body.

Several witnesses yelled at him to turn around and he did.

He came back and kneeled down next to the body. Brown said she was shocked by what he did next.

“He comes and kneels down beside her and takes his hands puts it in her blood and puts it all over his face” Brown said. ”He stands up. My son started screaming at him and he stood up it was an unreal look in his eyes.”

Brown said she doesn’t think this was an accident.

“It seemed like it was done intentionally” Brown said. “No remorse. I mean how could you just come up and not check a pulse but you lay your hands.”

Brown said she will never forget what she saw.

“It was horrific” Brown said. “It is something I will never be able to take out of my mind.”

Two weeks prior to the incident Nelson posted a video on social media referring to himself as “King Nelson” and speaks about his mental health.

Walmart Rewards announced Wednesday enables Walmart+ members to access and store additional savings on products they see when shopping on Walmart.com or the Walmart app. These discounts — on items from groceries to household staples to pet care — then can be applied to future purchases online and in-store.

“We know our customers and members are mindfully managing their budgets these days” Chris Cracchiolo senior vice president and general manager of Walmart+ said in a blog post referring to the elevated prices of consumer packaged goods due to high inflation. “That’s why we’re excited to introduce a new member perk that delivers compounding value: Walmart Rewards.”

Related: Walmart makes InHome grocery delivery an add-on to Walmart+

Walmart Rewards works as follows (click here for video): As Walmart+ members shop products on Walmart.com or the Walmart app for each item they’ll see a checkbox option to add a defined dollar-amount reward. Checking off that digital reward adds that savings amount to their account to be accumulated and/or redeemed for a later purchase. Another prompt indicates the rewards earned with the current purchase and includes a link to the Rewards Center so members can track their rewards. Members shopping in-store scan the Walmart Pay QR code and tap “Use Walmart Rewards” to deduct the balance from their total at checkout.

So for example if after several shopping trips or online orders a Walmart+ member has collected $10 in Walmart Rewards a $25 purchase would become a $15 purchase when the rewards are applied at checkout according to Cracchiolo.

“Members can bank their digital rewards in the Walmart wallet in the app and online and use them to save on future purchases in stores and online” he explained. “These new item-specific rewards powered by the Ibotta Performance Network are available exclusively for Walmart+ members starting today. We’re focusing first on providing rewards on items purchased by our members and over time we’ll continue to expand the program to deliver new ways to earn rewards.”

In June 2021 Walmart said it entered a multiyear partnership with cashback rewards platform Ibotta to launch a new digital offers program on Walmart.com and the Walmart app. Through the program Walmart customers receive access to hundreds of cash rebates on popular products. And in a unique element of the program customers redeem the rebates and get the cashback rewards directly through their Walmart accounts and the cash earned could be applied toward future Walmart purchases a Walmart+ membership grocery delivery and other transactions.

A big plus for Walmart Rewards is that it doesn’t require Walmart+ members to sign up use another app or clip coupons Cracchiolo noted.

“It works any way members choose to shop. Whether they do most of their shopping in-store or online members can take advantage of digital offers to earn Walmart Rewards” he said in the blog adding “Walmart Rewards is not static. This opens the door to endless earning possibilities for members in the future. We’ll continue to build new ways to reward member loyalty within the Walmart Rewards program.”

Walmart Rewards marks the latest benefit expansion for Walmart+ which competes with Amazon’s Prime customer benefits offering. Launched in mid-September 2020 Walmart+ offers members unlimited free same-day grocery delivery from stores ($35 order minimum); free shipping (no order minimum) and an array of shopping tools such as Scan & Go contactless checkout (via the Walmart app) for $98 per year or $12.95 a month. Other benefits include prescription drug savings member-exclusive pricing and deals and early access to promotions like Black Friday and new product releases. Walmart+ members also are eligible for six months of the Spotify Premium music streaming service at no cost.

This past April Walmart boosted the Walmart+ fuel benefits. Members now get an instant discount of up to 10 cents on each gallon of fuel they buy at participating gas stations. Walmart also has added 12000 Exxon and Mobil stations to the Walmart+ fuel benefit a more than sixfold increase that made the discount available at more than 14000 stations in 48 states. Overall Walmart+ customers can save 10 cents per gallon at participating Exxon and Mobil fuel stations and 5 cents to 10 cents per gallon at Walmart and Murphy USA gas stations. Member pricing also is available at more than 500 Sam’s Club locations.

And last month Walmart made its “food to fridge” InHome delivery service an optional add-on in Walmart+. The move blends two stand-alone subscriptions into one experience Walmart noted. Walmart+ members including those subscribed for $98 per year or $12.95 per month can add unlimited no-fee and tip-free InHome delivery for another $7 per month or $40 per year. Those prices translate into $138 annually for both services or $10 less than previous annual pricing when Walmart+ and InHome were separate memberships the company said.

Last week Walmart announced the addition of the Paramount+ streaming video service to the Walmart+ program. At no extra cost Walmart+ members get a Paramount+ Essential Plan subscription a $59 value."

Am I nuts for being really excited by Walt Disney Wold's upcoming ""Journey of Water Inspired by Moana"" walk-through attraction?

Disney is sharing some new construction photos from the attraction which is coming to Epcot's World Nature zone. The pictures show a lot of rock work which Disney World guests can see taking shape from the monorail as it passes above the work site.



Images courtesy Disney

I'm a sucker for good rock work in a theme park or attraction. Whenever I see good rock work I immediately forget where I have been and buy into this new themed environment. A cave a mountain a canyon - it doesn't matter what the rock work is supposed to represent I send my imagination there without hesitation.

That's why Epcot's new Moana attraction has me so excited - because well-themed physical environments should not be limited to big-ticket attractions and immersive themed lands. Journey of Water is a walk-through in the heart of the park. I imagine that eventually most people who experience Journey of Water will have just stumbled into it on their way to someplace else in Epcot. This isn't being designed as some destination attraction.



Concept image for Journey of Water Inspired by Moana

And that makes it all the more exciting to me. It excites me to see Disney appearing to put some effort into creating more well-themed and highly decorated environments for the ""spaces in between"" in its parks. That berm-to-berm attention to detail distinguishes Disney and other top theme parks from competitors who design and maintain their parks more simply as a collection of individual rides and shows.

According to Disney ""Journey of Water will allow guests to explore and engage with water as it travels from our skies to our oceans and back again."" The walk-through will depict the water cycle through a variety of environments overseen by Moana who will be depicted in the rock work as the water arrives at the ocean.

Disney has not announced an opening date for this experience but based on its progress I would guess sometime in the middle to the end of next year. So it will be a while before we can judge how well Disney has delivered on this concept. Granted I would not be as excited for Journey of Water had Disney not also recently opened Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind and Remy's Ratatouille Adventure in Epcot. If Disney were trying to pass off Journey of Water as a headline attraction it would be setting this experience up to disappoint many Walt Disney World visitors.

But as a supporting attraction that brings new texture and experience to the heart of the former Future World Journey of Water promises to be exactly the plussed detail that Walt Disney World needs to maintain its lead among theme park destinations.

These are actors like Julie Andrews and Betty White musicians including Sir Elton John and creators such as Jim Henson.

Counting this year’s honorees just 304 people have been named Disney Legends in the 35 years since the award program began. And this year a Sonoma Valley man is joining their ranks.

On Friday Chris Montan was due to be named a Disney Legend along with Kristen Bell Patrick Dempsey Idina Menzel Ellen Pompeo and others in an awards ceremony in Anaheim.

Montan isn’t an actor but as an executive music producer he has had a hand in some of the most iconic music of Disney and Pixar movies including “Frozen” “The Lion King” and “The Little Mermaid” during his 35 years with the company. These are songs we know from our childhoods and even as adults and they’re timeless according to Montan.

“A lot of the songs you heard growing up I heard for the first time over the phone” Montan said. “I think because of my background in song writing I knew fairly well when something was going to be a hit.”

From punk to Disney

Montan came west in 1976 moving from Boston to L.A. and bringing with him visions of becoming a singer and songwriter. His dream became reality in 1980 when he released his soft-rock/pop album “Any Minute Now” with 20th Century Fox Records.

But soon the industry changed he said. The punk movement in New York was starting to make its way into the the L.A. music scene eclipsing his softer style. He decided to look for a different gig.

Montan learned that Disney had started making character records (albums starring Disney characters like Mickey and Goofy) such as “Mickey Mouse Disco.” He landed a position as a music publisher and quickly rose in the ranks at Disney.

“I took it thinking ‘I’ll do it for awhile and see what I think’” Montan said.

But once he started work on “The Little Mermaid” he began to see the job as a long-term gig. For the beloved 1989 animated movie he helped compose the sounds of the sea creatures.

Within three years at Disney Montan was named vice president of music for motion pictures and television. He produced developed music and spent time in the studio focusing on making music.

In 1999 he became president of Walt Disney Music. But even with the big titles he held during his career he stayed on the creative side of the Disney magic.

One thing Montan thinks people would be surprised to know is that developing the soundtrack for a movie usually takes about four to five years. Often lyrics need to be rewritten to fit a new storyline by the time a song is finished.

The melodies tend to stay the same.

“I was always trying to make music that the melody came first because if you had a good melody you get to people’s emotions” Montan said. “Music is the fastest way to bypass your head and get to the heart.”

Contemporary classics

Montan has worked on all the major Disney and Pixar projects audiences know and love from the past four decades from “Aladdin” to “Finding Dory.”

He remembers getting goosebumps when he heard for the first time “Can you Feel the Love Tonight” a classic hit from “The Lion King” after working with the lyricist composers to fit the song with the story line.

He got a similar feeling when he heard the Grammy Award-winning songs “A Whole New World” (“Aladdin) and “Let it Go” (“Frozen”) for the first time. He instantly knew those were tunes audiences would never forget.

The timelessness of Disney songs always has been an intentional result of Montan’s work. He made sure the melodies were consistently heavy on orchestral sounds because of the longevity of that type of composition.

“I don’t want anyone to think about ‘The Little Mermaid’ or ‘Lion King’ and thinking about it as something that happened ‘back then’” Montan said.

His recipe for musical success evolved over the years. As Disney movies began portraying characters from a wider range of cultures and backgrounds Montan had to consistently adapt the sounds to fit the setting.

“If I was working on ‘Lilo and Stitch’ I had to learn about Hawaiian music” Montan said. “It was like going to a world university of music.”

When Montan was appointed president of Walt Disney Music in 1999 he took on the musical responsibility of Disney and Pixar animated feature films Disney Theatrical stage productions and Disney theme parks and resorts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1enpmZWVkLmNvbS9hdWRyZXl3b3Jib3lzL2ZpcnN0LXRpbWUtY3J1aXNlLWV4cGVyaWVuY2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,First Time Cruise Experience On The Disney Wish,"So here are some things I wish I would've known and some things I'll keep in mind if I ever go on a cruise again.

How does Disney Vacation Club work?

When you sign a Disney Vacation Club contract and become a DVC member you are essentially purchasing a yearly allotment of DVC vacation points.

You can choose the number of points that best fits your travel style. With your points you can reserve accommodations at Disney Vacation Club resorts at Disney parks worldwide and other select destinations like Aulani A Disney Resort & Spa in Hawaii Disney's Hilton Head Island Resort in South Carolina and Disney's Vero Beach Resort in Florida.

Aulani A Disney Resort & Spa. SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY

How many points you'll need for each stay depends on which resort you book how many nights you're reserving what time of year you visit and what type of room you choose. For example rooms at Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge at Disney World currently start at 7 points per night for a standard studio villa room that sleeps up to four guests and go up to 36 points per night for a club-level room with a savanna view.

You can use your points any way you wish either for one over-the-top vacation or a handful of shorter getaways throughout the year. You also have the option to ""bank"" vacation points to use the following year or can ""borrow"" them from the next year to book a stay in the current ""use year"" — or the time each year when you get your new allocation of vacation points.

In other words you could purchase a contract for fewer points than your ideal stay requires but through banking and borrowing from previous or future use years you could have enough points to book the reservation you want every two or three years.

Through banking and borrowing it may still be cost-effective to purchase a contract you only plan to use every two or even three years.

How much does Disney Vacation Club cost?

The cost of your Disney Vacation Club contract depends primarily on how many annual points you purchase when you become a member.

A contract includes between 150 and 1000 vacation points which are currently priced at $207 per point for available resorts like the newly remodeled villas at Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa Disney's Riviera Resort and Aulani A Disney Resort & Spa.

DISNEY VACATION CLUB

Based on sample pricing of 150 points at $207 per point plus a $250 document preparation fee $578.30 in closing costs and a small discount currently available (DVC often runs similar specials for new members) the total one-time membership cost is $31728.30 for 150 points purchased directly from Disney.

DISNEY VACATION CLUB

Of course this all-in pricing only applies if you pay the full amount up front. Disney also offers fixed annual percentage rate financing but you'll pay significantly more over the life of your contract if you go that route. Using the sample numbers supplied by Disney you would pay $53860.80 during the course of a 10-year loan $22132.50 more than if you paid the full amount upfront.

You'll also be responsible for annual maintenance fees. At some resorts like Disney's Vero Beach Resort and Disney's Hilton Head Island Resort a lower price per point is offset by above-average maintenance fees which have continued to increase over time.

Buying direct or resale

Buying into Disney Vacation Club is purchasing a real estate interest and contracts are also available for purchase and resale on the secondary market with resale purchases yielding substantial savings — sometimes up to 50% — off direct-from-Disney prices. However buying a resale contract does come with limitations some of which are potentially significant.

Only members who have purchased at least 150 points directly from Disney (versus resale) are eligible for all of the previously detailed perks.

Additionally members who purchase a resale contract at any property other than Disney's Riviera Resort which opened in December of 2019 and is Disney Vacation Club's newest property cannot use their points to book at Riviera. On the flip side anyone who purchases a resale contract at Riviera can only use their vacation points to book stays at Riviera.

There are many details and options to consider when deciding if Disney Vacation Club is right for you — and how to purchase your points if you decide to take the plunge. But for some families like mine this is the key to unlocking more Disney without always being tied to paying the rack rate at the resorts.

Does Disney Vacation Club save you money?

A Disney Vacation Club membership may save you money but you have to think long and hard about how likely you are to spend the next 40 or so years visiting Disney resorts with your family.

If you visit Walt Disney World or Disneyland every year or two stay on Disney property in a deluxe resort and plan to do so for years to come odds are Disney Vacation Club could make a lot of sense for you.

Additionally Disney Vacation Club villas may be the right way to go if you enjoy easy access to the parks and the immersion that comes with staying at a Disney property but crave more space and the comforts of home. Studio villas include kitchenettes with wet bars refrigerators toasters and microwaves. Larger villas with at least one bedroom offer even more amenities including full kitchens with dishwashers as well as washers and dryers.

Even if you typically stay in moderate resorts it could still be cost effective to purchase a DVC contract. Know though that it will take you longer to reach your break-even point.

If you're a budget traveler and typically book the lowest-priced value resorts a DVC contract might not be right for you. Or if you only sometimes stay in Disney resorts then renting may be the better option for you (more on that soon).

Disney recently announced plans to develop new Disney Vacation Club villas at Disney's Polynesian Village Resort as well. The new villas are projected to open in late 2024 along with new recreation offerings and dining options.

Disney has not yet shared additional details about on-sale dates and room types but the company has said that the proposed property ""would complement the existing resort and evoke the spirit of the Pacific Islands.""

A new tower with theming inspired by characters and stories from classic Walt Disney Animation Studios films is also underway at the Disneyland Hotel.

More Disney Vacation Club villas coming to Disneyland Resort is good news for current and prospective DVC members. With only one DVC property — The Villas at Disney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa — currently available at Disneyland it's nearly impossible for members at any other home resort to secure a room at the seven-month mark and new contracts are not currently for sale at the resort.

How to choose a home resort

If you're thinking about taking the plunge but are not sure which home resort to choose considering the location and your vacation style is usually the best way to start narrowing down your choices.

Monorail loop resorts with easy access to the Magic Kingdom and Epcot

Bay Lake Tower at Disney's Contemporary Resort Disney's Polynesian Villas & Bungalows and The Villas at Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa are the three Magic Kingdom-area resorts on the monorail loop. If proximity to the Magic Kingdom and a simple walk boat ride or monorail trip back to your home away from home after fireworks are your No. 1 priorities then these resorts should top your list.

Epcot and Disney's Hollywood Studios area resorts

If Epcot is your jam and a simple stroll back to your room after drinking or festival-ing around the World Showcase sounds like a dream Disney's Beach Club Villas and Disney's BoardWalk Villas can't be beat. Both properties are also a 15- to 20-minute walk or boat ride from Disney's Hollywood Studios so you can easily visit each park without a ton of effort. Disney's Beach Club Villas boasts the most desirable pool on Disney property while Disney's BoardWalk Villas is home to a lively mix of nightlife and entertainment.

Just behind these two properties is DVC's newest resort Disney's Riviera Resort. It's a quick scenic ride on the Disney Skyliner from both parks. Riviera's upscale European theming breathtaking views and luxe details make it arguably the most elegant DVC resort.

Convenient access to Disney Springs and golf

For those who are not as concerned about being close to the parks — particularly those with a car — there are two properties worth considering: Disney's Old Key West Resort and Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa. Both are sprawling more affordable resorts with spacious recently renovated rooms and easy access to Disney Springs and Disney's Lake Buena Vista Golf Course.

Immersive escapes

Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge sets the bar for Disney resort theming at its most ambitious and immersive. The African-inspired resort which includes two separate branches of DVC villas — one in its Jambo House and another in the Kidani Village — is filled with stunning African art and artifacts. The property is surrounded by four expansive savannas that are home to more than 30 different species of African wildlife including giraffes and zebras that can be seen from the balcony of many villas.

Also topping the list of idyllic retreats that feel miles away from the hustle and bustle of the theme parks are the Copper Creek Cabins and Boulder Ridge Villas at Disney's Wilderness Lodge. Rustic grandeur is the name of the game in the breathtaking main building and a stay in one of the 26 waterfront Cascade Cabins on the shores of Bay Lake tops my DVC bucket list.

Disneyland

If Disneyland Resort is your Disney vacation of choice you only have one DVC resort to choose from right now. Disney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa is Disneyland's grand dame resort with rustic California craftsman-style architecture a stunning lobby and an unbeatable location with dedicated entrances to both Disney California Adventure Park and the Downtown Disney District.

Beach and island resorts

Many DVC members love the resorts as much as the theme parks and three DVC resorts bring Disney's signature theming and service to beachfront escapes. Disney's Hilton Head Island Resort and Disney's Vero Beach Resort give members a way to get their Disney fix on the Atlantic coast. Meanwhile Aulani A Disney Resort & Spa on Oahu deserves a spot on every Disney bucket list. Next-level Walt Disney Imagineering helmed by famed imagineer Joe Rohde integrates Hawaiian history and culture top-notch dining and recreation and plenty of Disney magic into this highly authentic Hawaiian retreat.

How can I book a Disney Vacation Club stay?

Booking a Disney Vacation Club stay is similar to booking any Disney resort stay aside from the difference in booking windows. At 8 a.m. Eastern time 11 months before check-in for your home resort or seven months before check-in for other DVC resorts you can log in to your Disney account and book a DVC stay. DVC has a booking window calculator to help you determine when you can make your reservation.

DVC members can also exchange their points for stays at select resorts worldwide through Interval International as well as use points for other Disney vacations including Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser stays Disney Cruise Line sailings Adventures By Disney packages and National Geographic Expeditions. However exchanging your DVC points for any of these options will not get you as much value for your points as you'll receive when you use them at a DVC resort.

A smarter move if you don't need your points for your own Disney vacation in a particular year is to rent out your points and use the cash to book an alternative vacation.

Will I be able to upgrade to a bigger room if I am a Disney Vacation Club member?

One of the biggest perks of Disney Vacation Club is having access to multiple room types at some of Disney's best on-site resorts. For example at Bay Lake Tower at Disney's Contemporary Resort you can stay in studio rooms that sleep up to four guests or one- two- or three-bedroom villas that can accommodate up to 12 guests. The latter come with full kitchens and laundry machines.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 4 Disney's Bay Lake Tower. SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY 0 1 2 3

At Disney's Polynesian Village Resort you can go all-out and stay in an overwater bungalow that sleeps up to eight guests and has a private plunge pool and Magic Kingdom views. Room sizing and layout options vary by property but each DVC resort has multiple room types to choose from.

Renting Disney Vacation Club points

Not ready to take the plunge or just want a way to save on occasional Disney trips? A great way to try before you buy is to rent DVC points from an existing DVC member.

If you don't happen to know anyone with points to spare there are a number of third-party companies that help make the process smooth for everyone involved in the transaction. Reputable sites include DVC Rental Store and David's Vacation Club Rentals.

You may find that occasionally renting DVC points is the perfect way to control costs while enjoying some comforts of home and staying in the ""Disney bubble."" Or once you get a taste you may decide to jump all the way in and explore whether buying some DVC points of your own might just be the best path forward for your family's future Disney trips.

Bottom line

Joining Disney Vacation Club was a no-brainer for our family. We were visiting Walt Disney World at least once a year and had young kids who needed naps and quiet time. Not to mention my husband and I wanted to have our own space to lounge in when the kids slept.

BROOKE MCDONALD/THE POINTS GUY

We bought our first DVC contract at our favorite resort Disney's BoardWalk Villas and based our number of purchased points on staying in a one-bedroom boardwalk-view villa once a year. As our kids got older and no longer needed naps meaning we could spend more time outside our room we decided to change our accommodation to a smaller studio villa with a standard view. By making this switch and visiting at off-peak times we realized that we could get nearly four times as many nights on Walt Disney World property for the same number of points.

Our DVC points have also been used to stay at The Villas at Disney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa and Aulani A Disney Resort & Spa. The ability to use your points at different times of the year at different resorts and in different room types makes it so you can adjust your approach to Disney vacations as your family grows and changes.

Discovery continues its ongoing corporate reshuffling.

The platform reportedly laid off close to 70 people this month. That includes the entire teams overseeing unscripted kids and family and international content according to two former HBO Max execs who asked not to be named.

Those three divisions responsible for buying shows from production companies and creators and working closely with them during production are now completely gone.

One former employee says as many as 13 people of color previously in charge of developing shows like The Gordita Chronicles and the Spanish-language docuseries Menudo: Forever Young have been let go likely influencing the types of shows and movies that are greenlit moving forward. Among those laid off are Jen Kim an Asian woman who served as the senior vice president of the international team and Kaela Barnes a Black woman who worked under Kim.

“I don’t think anyone knows just how white the staff is” one former executive told The Daily Beast.

Former HBO Max staffers say there are barely any non-white people left in the upper ranks of content with one naming Joey Chavez an executive vice president of drama as one of the few people of color still there. Because HBO Max and the original HBO channel operate somewhat independently one former executive conceded that “there may be one Black woman on the HBO side. Maybe.”

The layoffs have “amplified the lack of diversity at HBO” another former executive told The Daily Beast. “HBO is the most homogenous part of this umbrella. Instead of trying to figure out how to integrate some of the [Max] executives into HBO they just made this sweeping cut of three divisions: kids family and international. A lot of Black and brown people lost their jobs.”

Ever since parent company Warner Bros. merged with Discovery earlier this year employees at Warner have grappled with the changing values of the newly created company. Discovery CEO David Zaslav was charged with helping Warner crawl out of a $50 billion hole. He came in like a wrecking ball tearing up CNN’s $300 million streaming service CNN+ and vowing to pull the Warner-owned news channel away from “advocacy” journalism.

More changes have come in the past couple of weeks.

Earlier this month it was announced that Batgirl the $90 million film planned for HBO Max starring Afro-Latina actress Leslie Grace would be shelved completely in favor of a tax write-off. Over the weekend CNN media correspondent and host Brian Stelter a frequent target of right-wing criticism was fired from the network.

Former Warner employees believe these changes are just as much about business as they are about reshaping the ideological perception of Warner properties. It all points to the same end they say: A rejection of left-wing or highly diverse content in favor of more homogenous Middle America-friendly fare. The lack of diversity in content staff might just make that goal easier.

“ HBO is the most homogenous part of this umbrella. Instead of trying to figure out how to integrate some of the [Max] executives into HBO they just made this sweeping cut of three divisions: kids family and international. A lot of Black and brown people lost their jobs. ”

In a statement to The Daily Beast HBO highlighted shows like Euphoria Rap Sh!t A Black Lady Sketch Show and Los Espookys all of which are led by diverse characters.

“HBO and HBO Max have always shown a commitment to diverse programming and storytellers and always will” the company said.

An internal graphic comparing the audiences of Discovery+ and HBO Max showed a stark demographic difference between the two streamers. Where HBO Max is popular with diverse groups single people and drivers of hybrid cars Discovery+ is popular with white married people who drive SUVs minivans and “traveling buses.” HBO Max viewers are on TikTok and Instagram while Discovery+ viewers use social media platforms Facebook and Twitter with the added caveat “if any.” HBO Max viewers have no kids. Discovery+ viewers are either “empty nesters” or have grandchildren. Discovery may be trying to pull HBO into its orbit as it focuses on what it does best.

HBO Max’s reality offerings presented an obvious sticking point for the new bosses. Where Discovery properties like TLC and HGTV send camera crews out to film what they can find HBO Max’s offerings are more carefully crafted. They’re sometimes buoyed by stars like Selena Gomez or Steph Curry who have the power to command big paychecks and they’re noticeably sleeker with smoother edits and more complicated camera set-ups adding to their budgets.

One former exec describes Discovery+ as a “more general audience platform that doesn’t have the specificity that HBO Max was tailored to. I think Discovery is just a very ‘all’ audience [they] don’t wanna make things that are political topical alienate Middle America—more Chip and Joanna” they said referring to the home renovation show Fixer Upper: Welcome Home hosted by Chip and Joanna Gaines.

Leslie Grace in Batgirl HBO Max

“If David Zaslav had his wish he would just program Chip and Joanna all day long” the executive said. “There was just a massive ‘We don’t need you. You’re not offering the things we’re focused on.’”

The change in perspective could also partly explain why so many titles have recently disappeared from HBO Max’s platform. Our sources agree that the removals are mostly related to money. The company can claim a tax break for the costs associated with certain shows as long as it promises to stop profiting off them which means taking them down altogether.

“They’re canceling a lens of perspective that I don’t think exists when you look at Discovery-branded shows” one former staffer said.

Speaking of the company’s plans to combine HBO Max and Discovery+ into one giant streaming service in the near future the laid-off exec said: “Don’t be surprised if there’s a new name for the platform.”

Overall there’s a sense that HBO Max’s executives of color were just another casualty in the company’s quest to get itself out of debt content quality be damned.

“In terms of people seeing themselves reflected whether it’s ethnic or LGBTQ when you have people who are diverse the lens with which they evaluate [content] factors in things that I think my white colleagues just don’t think about” one former executive said.

“It’s deep” said another. “What are they going to do with this disproportionate amount of people of color that were let go? They need to replace them in some capacity. Or do they not care? That’s what we’ve been told that they just don’t care.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzI1L3dhcm5lci1icm9zLWdhbWVzLWRpc2NvdmVyeS1kYXZpZC1oYWRkYWTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,David Haddad: Warner Bros. Games has Discovery's support,"The longtime head of Warner Bros. Games David Haddad is feeling good at a particularly pivotal time for his 11-studio team. Why it matters: WB Games is having a banner year after an uncharacteristically fallow stretch devoid of major in-house releases since 2020.

It’s also doing so amid high-profile job and project cuts at other divisions of the newly formed Warner Bros. Discovery conglomerate.

Haddad tells Axios his division is profitable and his teams have been well-supported with no layoffs and no projects cut by the new owners.

Details: WB Games’ run of 2022 hits began with April’s Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga which has outsold everything this side of Bandai Namco’s Elden Ring. Then came July’s externally developed MultiVersus that month's best-selling game in the U.S. and a title that just passed the 20 million player mark.

Expected blockbusters still to come include the Batman-themed Gotham Knights (October) Hogwarts Legacy (February) and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League (TBD 2023).

It also has a big Harry Potter mobile game co-published with Netease on the way this year.

What they’re saying: “One of our superpowers is the strength of those 11 studios” Haddad told Axios during a video call from his corner office overlooking the Warner Bros. lot.

Developers at those studios worked on games throughout WB Games’ quiet period Haddad said as he repeatedly emphasized a division-wide push for game quality.

He attributed the cancellation of versions of Gotham Knights for older consoles as well as a recent nine-week delay for Hogwarts Legacy as part of the division’s strategy to give “the right amount of time to deliver the best experiences.”

The Discovery factor: Haddad has held on to his position while other Warner leaders have been cleared out following the Discovery deal. He exudes confidence that his team won’t be kneecapped.

“I do believe especially moving forward that we have a critically important role to play inside the company” he said describing a division-wide opportunity to bring company franchises to people who prefer games to other media.

Asked if the division would be there for the long haul he said: “Warner Bros. Discovery leadership has expressed a strong belief in the growth of the games business and being part of that overall company strategy.”

Bloomberg and CNBC reported that previous owner AT&T had tried selling the studios for $4 billion in 2020.

The big picture: WB has far more in-house development muscle than media rivals Disney which shed its studios in 2016 and Netflix which only recently began purchasing some small teams.

Notes on three of WB Games' biggest games:

Haddad frames the free-to-play MultiVersus as proof of the division’s potential with long-lasting games that are run as services. With plans for a continuously expanding roster it could be another crossover-filled Fortnite though Haddad said the team’s “attention and focus” for roster growth will be on WB Discovery’s existing intellectual property.

The release of the well-received Lego Star Wars raised questions about the future of the Lego license with WB Games. “We've been a long long partner with Lego and we're excited for that to continue” Haddad said. It also put a microscope on work conditions at WB’s TT Games studios which the company says it is committed to getting right.

It also put a microscope on work conditions at WB’s TT Games studios which the company says it is committed to getting right. Trailers for Hogwarts Legacy have been popular but some potential players called for a boycott of the game considering Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling’s comments about transgender people. Bloomberg has reported that the game’s developers have pushed to include trans characters in the game and WB Games has previously said Rowling was not “directly involved” with the game. Asked about people who might avoid the game to avoid supporting Rowling Haddad said: “We're going to stay very focused on the game that we built and the great job that the Avalanche studio has done.” He added: “We want everybody that loves this world and loves these stories and loves these characters.”

Discovery Merger — List,"The staggering decision to scrap “Batgirl” leads a growing list of HBO Max titles audiences may never see thanks to the Warner Bros. Discovery merger.

On Monday Deadline broke the news that six more movies and series would not go forward at the streaming service notably including “Batman: Caped Crusader” from Matt Reeves who despite the change just cut a multi-year film deal with Warner Bros. (which yes will include another Robert Pattinson-starring “The Batman.”)

The animated DC series is expected to continue production and possibly stream elsewhere per Borys Kit for The Hollywood Reporter. But not all of the impacted projects can be so lucky.

“The movie is practically finished and turned out beautifully” lamented “Scoob!: Holiday Haunt” co-writer Tony Cervone in an Instagram post made when the film’s cancellation was first announced along with “Batgirl” in early August. “I am heartbroken” he continued.

“Why cancel a 95% finished holiday movie this close to fall?” tweeted co-writer Paul Dini. The animated sequel to the 2020 “Scoob!” (which did remarkably well considering it arrived in theaters at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic) was due out in a matter of weeks.

In a later Instagram post Cervone revealed the “Scoob!: Holiday Haunt” team had gone ahead with recording the film’s score regardless: “So what do you do when the movie is canceled but you’ve already paid for the stage and the musicians? You record the damn score!”

Director Bill Haller was similarly optimistic tweeting: “I can’t wait for all the fans to see the amazing performances from this passion project which I know will make you very happy.

Animation has been hit especially hard by Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav’s self-imposed mandate to find $3 billion in synergy savings. Of the nine shelved projects reported thus far only two are live-action: the aforementioned “Batgirl” and the LeBron James-produced “House Party” remake.

To be updated continuously: Here are all of the movies and TV series shelved — temporarily or permanently — amid the Warner Bros. Discovery merger so far. For the dozens of completed projects unceremoniously removed from the HBO Max catalog see IndieWire’s running list including “Infinity Train” “The Not-Too-Late with Elmo Show” “Vinyl” and more.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vdmlwL2hvdXNlLW9mLXRoZS1kcmFnb24td29udC1rZWVwLXdhcm5lci1icm9zLWRpc2NvdmVyeS1mcm9tLWRyYWdnaW5nLTEyMzUzNTAwMDQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'House of the Dragon' Won't Keep Warner Bros. Discovery From Dragging,"David Zaslav must be hoping dragon fire can distract from the other fires burning at Warner Bros. Discovery right now.

HBO’s “Game of Thrones” prequel/spinoff “House of the Dragon” launched Sunday to much fanfare racking up nearly 10 million viewers across linear and streaming on the night of its premiere according to the network. While the ratings unsurprisingly fell short of “Game of Thrones” at its peak they far outstripped same-day viewership for recent HBO hits such as “Euphoria” and “Succession.”

And the numbers will grow substantially in the weeks to come: HBO expects that same-day viewership will ultimately account for only 20 to 40 percent of “the show’s total gross audience.” In other words a lot more people will catch up with “House of the Dragon” later on HBO Max. But the 10 million figure is already enough to make the first episode of “Dragon” the most watched series premiere in the history of HBO as the network’s press release proudly declared.

Unfortunately Wall Street didn’t seem to take much notice. WBD’s stock is still down almost 50 percent from April when the merger closed; the share price has not topped $14 in more than two weeks. The company’s market cap has also plunged $30 billion since April a 51 percent drop staggering even amid this year’s brutal market cap declines.

It’s instructive to compare this to Netflix’s stock which rose more than 15 percent in the lead-up to and days following “Stranger Things” Season 4’s premiere and record-breaking viewership on the service. A similar bump for “House of the Dragon” has yet to materialize.

Of course it’s not hard to pinpoint why. Netflix’s recent turmoil aside the streamer is in a much healthier position than WBD which is burdened with about $55 billion in debt and posted a $3 billion loss for the first half of the year. Netflix co-CEOs Reed Hastings and Ted Sarandos have also managed to regain control of their narrative as far as the Street is concerned spinning Q2’s second consecutive subscriber loss into a win by overestimating the decline and confidently projecting a return to growth in Q3.

WBD on the other hand is hardly projecting confidence. The week before “House of the Dragon” premiered the company slashed the price of an annual HBO Max subscription by 30 percent a rare promotional discount in the streaming age. It’s a clear sign leadership is nervous that many new subscribers coming for “Dragon” will churn out after the show’s first season ends.

And it's a somewhat valid concern given the negative buzz around HBO Max of late. After the already infamous “Batgirl” debacle CEO Zaslav’s slash-and-burn approach to cost-cutting has led to a wave of titles — mostly Max originals and Warner library titles — being pulled from the service to save money on residual payments.

The titles are purportedly among HBO Max’s least watched content but the lack of viewing data available makes verifying this difficult and the strategy is palpably alienating creatives and fans of the content in question.

WBD seemed to anticipate the move would spark backlash: The timing of the annual-plan discount coincided not just with the “Dragon” premiere but the announcement of many titles’ impending removal. HBO Max leadership is likely dreading a subscriber loss as a result of the Great Zaslav Purge and hoping the discount will stem such a loss.

Those fears may be overblown; the strong ratings for “House of the Dragon” after the “Game of Thrones” divisive final season have once again proven the discrepancy between social media chatter and actual public opinion. But the fact is that WBD is failing miserably at the PR game while also failing to impress Wall Street and a big hit for HBO doesn’t seem likely to help much. If Zaslav wants to change WBD’s narrative he’ll need to change the way he’s currently steering it."

This is crucial of course but sustainability is about so much more than reducing fossil fuel energy usage.

With over 2bn tonnes of solid waste produced globally every year (predominantly made up of e-waste and single-use plastics) our eco-conscious generation has an important role to play in transforming the way we use and dispose of material goods.

The annual growth rate of waste correlates more strongly with income growth than population level so there’s clearly something we can all do to stop this rate of devastation. Here we examine which big companies are demonstrating their commitment to overcoming the world’s waste problem - whether that’s by recycling and reusing plastic paper glass e-waste or food.

10. Unilever

Health and beauty product manufacturer Unilever has joined other top consumer companies in signing the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment. Previously seen as one of the ‘worst polluters’ the major brand owner has pledged to make 100% of their packaging recyclable or reusable by 2025.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vcmVhbGFzc2V0cy5pcGUuY29tL25ld3Mva2VwcGVsLXRvLWJ1eS04MC1zdGFrZS1pbi13YXN0ZS1tYW5hZ2VtZW50LWZpcm0tODAwLXN1cGVyLWZvci1zMzA0bS8xMDA2MTcyOC5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Keppel to buy 80% stake in waste management firm 800 Super for S$304m,"Keppel Corporation has bought an 80% interest in a Singaporean environmental services company 800 Super for S$304m (€219m).

Keppel said its subsidiaries - Keppel Asia Infrastructure Fund (KAIF) and Keppel Infrastructure would hold 48% and 32% interest respectively in 800 Super alongside the waste management firm’s co-founder and CEO William Lee’s 20% stake in the S$380m company.

Lee will continue to be 800 Super’s CEO after the transaction is completed.

Christina Tan CEO of Keppel Capital the parent company of the manager of KAIF said: “800 Super’s strong market position will enable it to capture more opportunities as Singapore intensifies its sustainable waste management efforts.“

Cindy Lim CEO of Keppel Infrastructure said: “The acquisition of a strategic interest in 800 Super complements and broadens the range of environmental services that Keppel Infrastructure offers.”

She said the acquisition would also create opportunities to synergise operations and enhance the competitive advantages of the two companies.

August 24 2022 – Properly disposing of a mattress and/or box spring just got a lot easier in Nevada County as WM joins with the Mattress Recycling Council to offer free disposal of mattresses and box springs at McCourtney Road Transfer Station.

Residents including those not serviced by WM can bring up to a combined five mattresses and/or box springs to the transfer station at 14741 Wolf Mountain Road Grass Valley during normal operation hours Wednesday through Sunday 8 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. for free disposal.

“We’re thrilled to provide this convenient program to all residents and hope it helps to reduce the number of illegally dumped mattresses and box springs in our communities” said Barry Skolnick Area Vice President for WM Northern California – Nevada. “Between this program and WM’s bulky collection offerings getting rid of an old mattresses and box spring is easier than ever and free.”

Mattresses disposed of through the Mattress Recycling Council’s Bye Bye Mattress program are disassembled and recycled. The steel foam fiber and wood recovered from mattresses and box springs are sent to manufactures to make hundreds of new products such as carpet padding construction rebar insulation filters and mulch.

The program is funded through a $10.50 recycling fee that is collected when a mattress or box spring is purchased in California. The fee is used to establish free drop-off locations and collection events throughout the state transport collected units from these sites to companies that dismantle the discarded products and recycle the materials. Other portions of the fee are dedicated to combating illegal dumping and research efforts that improve the recycling process and recyclability of the component material.

“We’re thankful to each of the solid waste facilities local businesses and nonprofit organizations that join our collection network and help us make recycling used mattresses easier for residents” said Mike O’Donnell MRC’s Managing Director. “Together this impressive network is collecting more than 1.5 million mattresses each year that are recycled right here in California.”

While mattress and box spring disposal is free customers seeking to dispose of other materials at McCourtney Road Transfer Station or residents seeking to dispose of more than five mattresses and box springs combined in one day will be charged standard disposal rates.

Mattresses not covered by this program include severely damaged wet twisted frozen or spoiled mattresses or box springs any mattress or box spring infested with beg bugs mattress pads or toppers sleeping bags pillows car beds crib mattresses air mattresses and sofa bed mattresses.

Residents seeking to take advantage of this program are asked to enter the transfer station through the normal scale house entrance and inform the attendant that they are dropping off only mattresses. If other materials are dropped off at the station standard disposal rates will apply.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vbGV2aXR0b3dubm93LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzI0LzkwLW1pbGxpb24tcmVuZXdhYmxlLW5hdHVyYWwtZ2FzLWZhY2lsaXR5LXBsYW5uZWQtZm9yLWxhbmRmaWxsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,$90 Million Renewable Natural Gas Facility Planned For Landfill,"Plans for the two renewable natural gas plants.

Waste Management has plans to construct two renewable natural gas plants next to one another at their sprawling Falls Township property.

The Falls Township Planning Commission Tuesday evening recommended land development plans for the site across from the Wheelabrator Falls waste-to-energy facility on New Ford Mill Road near Waste Management’s landfills.

The plans call for two 200000-square-foot facilities on 18 acres that would collect and convert gases recovered from the landfill operation for energy use.

Attorney Mike Meginniss who is working on behalf of Waste Management said the facility will add jobs and eliminate the company’s current practice of burning off gas created by its landfills.

The facility will cost $90 million and aims to be open in 2024.

The proposed facility which still needs to come before the Falls Township Board of Supervisors could reduce emissions of carbon dioxide significantly Meginniss said.

The two plants would capture gases created under the landfills as waste decomposes and pipe them to the renewable natural gas processing equipment. The two plants will convert the collected gases into renewable natural gas that be used for energy creation.

Waste Management officials said the two facilities are part of a company-wide program that will invest $800 million in 17 similar projects across the country.

The renewable natural gas created at the Falls Township site will be routed to a national pipeline and distributed.

Waste Management already runs many of its vehicles on natural gas but they will not fill up at the site. The site for fueling of Waste Management’s natural gas-burning trucks is in Bristol Township.

The proposed site of the two plants is currently open space and was once an executive golf course.

Prior to 2020 Exelon Generation operated the Pennsbury Generating Station that took gases from the landfill operation and used it to power homes.

However that facility was closed due to “prolonged period of flat electricity demand and historically low electricity prices” Exelon Generation which operates PECO announced in 2018.

With the closure of the facility Waste Management installed large flares to burn off the landfill gas emissions which worried some due to potential negative impacts on air quality and the environment.

Waste Management has operated landfills in Falls Township for decades.

The Fairless Landfill remains in operation and Waste Management purchased nearby land to expand their operations.

The Tullytown Landfill and GROWS Landfill in the township have both been closed for several years.

Editor’s Note: This article has been updated to note the Pennsbury Generation Station was operated by Exelon Generation and not PECO. PECO is part of Exelon Generation.

So far the U.S. Treasury Department says the squad known as the Russian Elites Proxies and Oligarchs (REPO) Task Force has worked with other governments to block and seize more than $30 billion belonging to those close to President Vladimir Putin.

“We will ensure that our sanctions continue to impose costs on Russia for its unprovoked and continuing aggression in Ukraine” Treasury said in a statement marking the task force’s first 100 days.

The Treasury’s confiscatory crackdown is targeting many of the same hidden oligarch assets that the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and its media partners exposed last fall as part of its sweeping Pandora Papers investigation. Based on more than 11.9 million leaked confidential financial records from 14 offshore service providers the project revealed the secret offshore holdings of more than 130 billionaires from 45 countries including 46 Russian oligarchs.

The Pandora Papers’ Russia findings along with those of past ICIJ projects on the offshore financial system (compiled into a single repository of stories known as The Russia Archive) became a go-to resource for oligarch-asset hunters worldwide after Western governments rushed to impose economic sanctions on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine in February. While much attention has focused on the imposition of sanctions on billionaires their family members and even a reported girlfriend of the Russian president authorities have also moved to actually confiscate their luxury assets a much bigger legal lift.

The U.S. European and Ukrainian governments have suggested that the sale of yachts private jets and other items would help finance Ukraine’s reconstruction from a war that has destroyed or damaged almost 1000 health centers and will cost billions of dollars.

Imposing sanctions has almost become commonplace. The U.S. government says it has conducted rigorous research into hundreds of Russian oligarchs politicians and their family members who have been sanctioned or banned from entering the United States.

But going the next step and confiscating assets is a complex legal process that can tie up governments for months – if not years. In some cases officials struggle through labyrinthian offshore corporate structures to establish who owns what. In other cases oligarchs are fighting back in court. Billionaire Alexei Mordashov recently failed to persuade a judge to allow him to regain access to his $68 million yacht Lady M on the basis that the yacht’s formal owner wasn’t him personally — it’s owned by a shell company.

Here’s breakdown of official efforts to seize assets of oligarchs named in the Pandora Papers and other ICIJ investigations.

Timchenko’s yacht

In March Italian authorities seized the 130-foot Lena yacht believed to be owned by Gennady Timchenko a former KGB schoolmate of President Putin.

The link was first reported by Pandora Papers media partners and ICIJ subsequently revealed how attorneys in the British Virgin Islands and the United Kingdom shipbuilders in Italy and bankers in Monaco had all helped Timchenko buy the Lena in 2010.

A checklist assembled by attorneys in the BVI to comply with local laws included reference letters for Timchenko from bankers and other details about the billionaire oil trader.

One secret document a 2009 trust agreement showed Timchenko controlled the BVI shell company that according to public paperwork owned the yacht. Months later the company granted Timchenko his friends and family the right to use the Lena “exclusively for pleasure purposes.”

In March 2014 the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Timchenko for his ties to Putin amid Russia’s efforts at the time to destabilize Ukraine. Months later an internal document produced by law firm Alemán Cordero Galindo & Lee described Timchenko’s company as “low risk.”

Records show the shell company Roxlane Corporate Ltd. continued for years to make payments in U.S. dollars for the yacht’s upkeep. Despite the sanctions against Timchenko records show the BVI law firm paid $300 in September 2014 to cover the yacht’s “Annual Register Maintenance Fee” and another $250 in April 2016 for “VESSEL M/Y LENA” on behalf of his company.”

Chemezov family’s yacht

In March Spain reported seizing the Valerie a $153 million super-yacht owned by Sergei Chemezov the billionaire chief executive of Russian defense contracting giant Rostec. Like Timechenko the U.S. sanctioned Chemezov in 2014 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The Pandora Papers revealed how Chemezov’s wife Ekaterina Ignatova and his step-daughter Anastasia Ignatova were central players in the family’s offshore empire. Pandora Papers records show the family was worth more than $350 million and linked to nine companies registered in the BVI and Belize between 2005 and 2016.

One of the BVI companies owned the Valerie according to ICIJ media partner IStories’ reporting as part of the Pandora Papers project.

Mordashov’s yacht

In March Italian authorities seized a luxury yacht linked to Russia’s richest man Alexei Mordashov. Months later an Italian court rejected a request to unfreeze the yacht the Lady M. The court found that Mordashov was the true owner of the yacht — not the company whose name appears on official paperwork.

An ICIJ investigation based on the Pandora Papers trove revealed how Mordashov used a Cypriot holding company and more than 60 shell companies registered in the BVI to invest in European companies and inside Russia take big stakes in the coal logging and media industries.

The Pandora Papers describe how accounting giant PwC’s Cypriot unit helped Mordashov build the offshore infrastructure of his business empire. ICIJ found the advisers also helped him and his life partner Marina Mordashova register companies to own the Lady M and a Bombardier luxury jet.

Pumpyanskiy’s yacht first to be auctioned

The first luxury yacht owned by a Russian oligarch and seized in response to President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has been sold at auction.

The Axioma which is estimated to be worth up to $75 million went on sale Aug. 23 in Gibraltar. Details are expected to follow as soon as later this week The 72 meter-yacht which features a gymnasium and infinity pool was previously owned by steel and oil and gas pipelines’ billionaire Dmitry Pumpyanskiy.

The United States sanctioned Pumpyanskiy and identified his yacht Axioma as “blocked property” earlier this month after similar measures by countries in Europe and Asia. “The United States is taking additional actions to ensure that the Kremlin and its enablers feel the compounding effects of our response to the Kremlin’s unconscionable war of aggression” the State Department said at the time.

Records from the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists’ Panama Papers investigation in 2016 revealed that Pumpyanskiy set up a shell company to buy the yacht in 2013.

Bankers at Credit Suisse in Geneva Switzerland helped Pumpyanskiy create a shell company in the British Virgin Islands to act as the yacht’s legal owner records show. Pumpyanskiy bought the company with “business profits” according to records.

The sale of the Axioma has reportedly drawn criticism because it is not being sold for the benefit of victims of the Ukraine war but for that of the U.S. bank J.Morgan Chase & Co. which says the sanctioned billionaire reneged on the terms of a loan.

Named Carlos Luis the vessel is optimised for catching red shrimp in Patagonian coastal waters in southern Argentina. Measuring 20.98 metres long by seven metres wide the newbuild utilises a design used in a number of other vessels that were built by the same shipyard for various customers over the last decade.

The trawler boasts refrigerated and ice storage facilities with a total volume of 110 cubic metres as well as Berycar winches reels and other deck equipment. This ensures that catch is loaded directly on ice as soon as it is hauled on board. The fishroom features Nautiplast insulation and a chiller from PM Refrigeracion.

The catch handling system supplied by BE-INOX also includes an automated grader and washing system.

The propulsion setup includes a Yanmar 6AYAM-ET main engine two Cummins 6CTA-G2GD1 auxiliary engines a Buen Rumbo hydraulic rudder and a Sleipner bow thruster. The main engine drives a five-bladed Kaplan propeller via a ZF gearbox to deliver a maximum speed of 10 knots.

The vessel features wheelhouse electronics supplied by Electronica Naval while the electrical installations were undertaken by Giordano Alpaheli. Power for the onboard systems is drawn from two Cramaco 60kVa generator sets.

Carlos Luis has since replaced Ana III an older shrimp trawler in the Aquellos Tres fleet.

The executive spent the last three years as head of electronic sales and trading at Wells Fargo

A traditional finance (TradFi) veteran with more than two decades of experience at bulge-bracket banks JPMorgan and Wells Fargo is jumping into crypto.

Digital assets prime brokerage Floating Point Group has tapped Peter Eliades — who last headed electronic trading sales for Wells Fargo — to oversee business development in the US and throughout Asia Pacific.

Eliades told Blockworks that the influence of cryptocurrency across “traditional media sports sponsorship [and] gaming” has become “increasingly evident.” The growing influence of digital assets in traditional spheres “by extension woke [Eliades] to the possibility of exploring something new and innovative” he said.

The executive’s focus on crypto stemmed from investing personal capital in a bid to “learn more about the benefits of digital markets and their pain points.”

Eliades was a vice president at Lehman Brothers in 2001 before becoming a managing director at Bear Stearns & Co. about four years later. He went on to work for JPMorgan as head of Americas trading before joining Wells Fargo and now looks to make a splash in crypto.

“[Eliades] has built world-class electronic trading businesses for decades and understands the role that crypto will play in shaping the future of global financial systems” Floating Point CEO John Peurifoy said in a statement.

Peter Eliades Floating Point’s new hire

Joining Floating Point was a particularly easy transition he added as Eliades has consulted for the company since 2018. The firm was founded that year and is backed by firms including Coinbase’s venture arm Naval Ravikant and Tribe Capital.

Eliades said he is focused on helping Floating Point earn client trust and establish itself as “critical subject matter experts who help bridge the gap between crypto-natives and TradFi firms.”

He highlighted the company’s global execution desk that can handle flexible order instructions and execute on a customer’s behalf. Though common in TradFi with equity and options markets Eliades said such capabilities are still fairly elusive in crypto.

“We see it as our first touch point to help bring asset managers into the space and it’s the service they’re all looking for first before they get more complicated with their operations” the new head of distribution said.

The hire of Eliades comes after the company revealed the launch of FlowVault in June. The service offers a console- and API-based management of assets across exchanges via a single account.

“That gives us a really exciting springboard to branch out into giving them the same smooth secure access into DeFi and other critical partnerships with trading solutions and OTC liquidity aggregators” the executive added.

“[This allows] clients to not only see and manage their assets but also trade stake store and leverage across the many options that are opening up to our crypto world.”

From the popularity of fashion items in culture to the work to overcome systemic barriers the Black community works in various ways to build accumulate and maintain wealth.

But in the words of Langston Hughes “Life for me ain’t been no crystal stair.” Black people have not always had the luxury or ease of access to the tools and resources necessary to build wealth. Because of the historical and present systems that impact the ability to build wealth there is a lack of trust in traditional banking systems. This lack of confidence has caused many Black people to be considered “unbanked” ultimately leading to a significant disparity in financial equity.

The folks at Wells Fargo have taken particular notice of this disparity. As a part of its Banking Inclusion Initiative the bank partnered with Black-led fintech startup MoCaFi to help alleviate the financial barriers for BIPOC community members.

Novartis plans to spin Sandoz into a publicly traded standalone business creating Europe’s largest generics company the Swiss drugmaker said Thursday.

A separation between Sandoz and Novartis’ pharma business was largely expected when the group unveiled a strategic review back in October. Competition and U.S. pricing pressure have been weighing on Sandoz and the broader generics industry for years. And having a generics business doesn’t really fit CEO Vas Narasimhan's stated focus on innovative drugs.

The separation “would further support our strategy of building a focused innovative medicines company with depth in five core therapeutic areas and strength in technology platforms” Narasimhan M.D. said in a statement Thursday. The split would also allow both companies to pursue different capital allocation strategies he added.

Over the past few months Sandoz reportedly attracted buyout interest including from an investor consortium of Blackstone and Carlyle for up to $25 billion. But Novartis hasn’t received any formal binding offers for Sandoz Narasimhan told reporters Thursday according to Reuters.

During that call Narasimhan said he still sees generics as a “high attractive” industry as quoted by Reuters. That's because $400 billion to $500 billion worth of branded drugs are expected to lose market exclusivity over the next decade he added.

Novartis had previously tried to sell Sandoz in pieces specifically the most problematic U.S. oral solids franchise to India’s Aurobindo Pharma. But the two firms abandoned the deal after hitting antitrust resistance.

Although Narasimhan remains hopeful that external Sandoz bids might emerge he acknowledged that a spinoff is the most likely scenario. Analysts generally agree that a spinoff is the best outcome.

“We think that this decision makes strategic sense as the division is taking a toll on the group’s growth and margins” ODDO BHF analysts wrote in a Thursday note.

In 2021 Sandoz ginned up $9.6 billion in full-year sales down 2% year over year mainly thanks to a 15% decline in the U.S. where pricing pressure has taken a toll.

But Sandoz’s business has shown signs of improvement lately. In the first half of 2022 Sandoz sales grew 6% at constant currencies to $4.7 billion contributing 18.6% of Novartis’ total revenue haul. As a result of the better-than-expected performance so far this year Novartis in July said it expected low single-digit percentage revenue growth for the generics business versus flat expectations before.

Looking longer term Novartis believes the Sandoz stabilization “creates a solid base for growth 2023 and beyond” Narasimhan told investors during a July call. “And a lot of that will be driven by the biosimilars portfolio.”

Sandoz has largely been counting on biosimilars for future growth. About a year ago it in-licensed a biosimilar to Roche’s Avastin from China’s Bio-Thera Solutions. The company’s applications for a high-concentration formulation of a Humira copycat and a biosimilar referencing Biogen’s Tysabri are under FDA review.

Narasimhan cited biosims for Humira Tysabri and Amgen’s bone drug Prolia as the three key upcoming biosimilar launches for Sandoz in the U.S. All told with a portfolio of over 15 assets Sandoz’s biosimilars are targeting $80 billion of originator sales he said during the July call.

Splitting Sandoz would mark the end of an era at Novartis. The Swiss pharma giant was created in 1996 through the merger between Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz.

In recent years spinoffs have become a popular strategy among Big Pharma companies who have sought to exit businesses outside their focus areas and double down on higher-margin drugs.

Novartis had previously spun off eye-care unit Alcon in 2019. Merck & Co. last year separated its own biosimilar business alongside women’s health and established medicines into Organon. GSK just finished demerging its Pfizer-partnered consumer health joint venture into a separately listed firm called Haleon. And Johnson & Johnson is preparing to do the same with its consumer health unit.

Sandoz is expected to be incorporated in Switzerland and listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange with an American depositary share arrangement in the U.S. Sandoz’s current CEO Richard Saynor will remain in his position. Novartis expects the spinoff to complete in the second half of 2023 pending final board and shareholder approvals among other conditions.

Meanwhile Novartis is in the process of a major restructuring that’s combining oncology with the rest of the pharma business into one structure. The retool will also cost up to 8000 jobs including many managerial roles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5maWVyY2ViaW90ZWNoLmNvbS9iaW90ZWNoL2ZyYWN0dXJlZC1wYWN0LXBoYXJtYS1sYXlzLWFkZGl0aW9uYWwtNTEtc3RhZmZlcnMtc3VzcGVuZHMtcGhhc2UtMS10cmlhbC1jb21wYW55LXN0cnVnZ2xlc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PACT Pharma culls lead asset diverts 54 staffers to new venture,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/fractured-pact-pharma-lays-additional-51-staffers-suspends-phase-1-trial-company-struggles on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5maWVyY2ViaW90ZWNoLmNvbS9iaW90ZWNoL2ZyYWN0dXJlZC1wYWN0LXBoYXJtYS1sYXlzLWFkZGl0aW9uYWwtNTEtc3RhZmZlcnMtc3VzcGVuZHMtcGhhc2UtMS10cmlhbC1jb21wYW55LXN0cnVnZ2xlc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9ib3N0b24vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA4LzI1L3BjaS1waGFybWEtYnJpZGdld2F0ZXItZmFjaWxpdHkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EXCLUSIVE: Pharma services firm opens new facility south of Boston - Boston Business Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2022/08/25/pci-pharma-bridgewater-facility.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9ib3N0b24vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA4LzI1L3BjaS1waGFybWEtYnJpZGdld2F0ZXItZmFjaWxpdHkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vbGRjLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvbGRjLWludmVzdHMtaW4tdG1jLXBoYXJtYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LDC invests £18m in TMC Pharma Services - LDC,"Leading mid-market private equity firm LDC has made an £18m minority investment in TMC Pharma Services.

That’s according to Dan Rizzo Veeva Systems' head of global business consulting who explained in an interview that pharma needs to be shifting sales and marketing tactics in this new so-called “blended environment” which includes developing a new sales compensation model for the future.

According to a recent report from Veeva—using data from 130 million quarterly field interactions across 80% of global biopharmas—video meetings are three times more effective than in-person interactions when it comes to driving new prescriptions. In fact Veeva found that pharma video calls with providers averaged around 21 minutes significantly longer than the two or three minutes of an in-person interaction.

Pre-pandemic an estimated 5% of sales interactions with healthcare professionals were digital and that number is nearly 30% post-pandemic. Specifically the field sales teams report interacting with healthcare professionals through email (18%) over the phone (5%) and on video (3%) according to the Veeva study.

As a result of the change pharma marketing departments are now having to create different and expanded content to arm sales professionals for client meetings. Plus content that sales teams traditionally left behind in the physician’s office via paper is now requested electronically and must contain a robust pipeline of digital content.

“The best reps will need compelling content for not only a first dialogue but follow-up meetings between reps and healthcare providers as well” Rizzo said.

Why the longer engagements via digital means? According to Rizzo it comes down to physicians preferring a planned meeting time than an unannounced walk-in.

“With a scheduled video meeting on the calendar you have the provider’s undivided attention” Rizzo said. “The fact that HCPs were willing to engage in this format they value what pharma marketers have to bring to the table.”

The next steps in the industry’s revolution relies on marketing departments finding the best balance between in-person and digital content and how to bridge visits without losing a healthcare provider’s attention.

So what about the talk around “digital fatigue""? Rizzo says that if the balance is correct pharma marketers are not facing this fatigue among their clients. Moving forward the mix will likely settle on a 70-30 split between in-person and digital connections. Keeping in mind this 30% digital touch point mix includes email video phone text or chat.

Rizzo also warns that the phone is the least effective digital channel so marketers should not concentrate too much time on this type of communication. In addition while email can be quite effective if personalized he warns to avoid the trap of mass email marketing blasts that healthcare providers will never open or read.

“It’s been interesting to see sales and marketing come closer together than ever before. The [sales] rep is serving as a bridge between sales and marketing” Rizzo said. In fact Rizzo sees marketing as the center of the brain: Marketing comes up with the “plan” and it is up to the pharma sales team to execute.

Plus the sales reps are the source of invaluable information to report back to the marketing team such as channel preferences what’s working and what is not etc. Therefore Rizzo notes the importance of automating and capturing this information from the front-line rep.

In this symbiotic relationship companies can get their sales force to understand that they “have a marketing role and responsibility within this organization […] We all need to be learning from one another” Rizzo said.

The next trend on the pharma marketing horizon is the reevaluation of compensation models for sales teams because current models rely on rewards for the end results. But with information now being shared at such a fast pace the analytics and the financials must adapt as well."

The Sony PlayStation 5 is inching towards its two-year anniversary and oh boy has it had a rocky start. Plagued with a consistent shortage of stock issues with incorrect deliveries and cancelled orders the PS5 has had a difficult time. But just when we thought things were looking up Sony has delivered another blow.

Today PlayStation’s CEO Jim Ryan announced the price of the console will be going up in the UK Europe Japan China Australia Mexico and Canada with the US slipping away scot-free.

The price change takes effect immediately and will see the price of the PS5 disc edition console increased by £30 from £449.99 to £479.99. The PS5 digital edition without the disc drive will also be bumped up by £30 taking the console to £389.99.

In a blog post released this morning Ryan blamed the price increase on the challenging global economic environment. “We’re seeing high global inflation rates as well as adverse currency trends impacting consumers and creating pressure on many industries” he wrote. “Based on these challenging economic conditions [Sony Interactive Entertainment] has made the difficult decision to increase the recommended retail price (RRP) of PlayStation 5 in select markets.”

The news comes just as the stock shortage in the UK is beginning to abate with the PS5 console being widely available to buy since July. Thankfully it appears retailers have yet to put up their prices in line with Sony’s recommendations and you can still buy the console at its old price today.

PS5 stock: Where can you buy the PS5 before it goes up in price?

While it’s a lot easier to buy a PS5 today the console still comes in and out of stock in the blink of an eye. Below we’ve listed exactly where you can buy the console at the time of writing but this is subject to change as stock sells out.

For the most up-to-date stock information we’d recommend heading over to our PS5 stock tracking liveblog which we have been running for more than a year now. This is where you can find the latest information about PS5 stock and buying the elusive console.

It’s worth pointing out that the PS5 disc edition console and the PS5 digital edition console are both still incredibly hard to buy on their own (without a bundle). Right now there are no retailers selling the console on its own with most listing the PS5 as part of a bundle with Horizon Forbidden West. We’re expecting these bundles to go up by £30 in the near future.

We’re not sure when third-party retailers will be upping their prices but have reached out to the most popular stores to find out and will update this page with any new information. Until then here’s where you can buy the console today before it goes up in price.

Kymeta has announced the appointment of aerospace industry veteran Nicole Piasecki to the board of directors and Fran Beaudette a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general to the board of advisers.

Piasecki has more than 35 years of experience at Boeing (NYSE: BA) and United Technologies Corp. and her appointment comes following the retirement of Steve Spengler from the board after five years of service Kymeta said Tuesday.

She held leadership positions at Boeing including head of marketing for the commercial division and president of the company’s Japanese arm and was former chairman of the board at Seattle University. She sits on the boards of BAE Systems Weyerhaeuser Co. and Howmet Aerospace.

Fran Beaudette

Piasecki previously served on the Federal Aviation Authority Management Advisory Board the Department of Transportation’s future of aviation advisory committee and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.

S. Douglas Hutcheson executive chairperson and co-CEO of Kymeta said Piasecki brings to the board her experience in the commercial aviation industry and her insight and expertise will help the company explore the “potential for global satellite and cellular broadband communications while on the move.”

Beaudette spent 32 years in the Army where he served as commanding general of Army Special Operations Command which is responsible for training equipping and organizing the service’s special operations.

Hutcheson said Beaudette’s military experience will be key as the company continues to make advances in land mobility and littoral marine environments.

“He brings the insight of what is required down range and the support logistics to insure we meet the mission requirement” Hutcheson added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt4cm8uY29tL2NpdHktb2YtaG9xdWlhbS1yZWNvZ25pemVkLWZvci1vcGVuaW5nLXVwLWZpc2gtaGFiaXRhdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,City of Hoquiam recognized for opening up fish habitat,"The City of Hoquiam was recognized for their efforts to open fish passage on city forestland.

Washington state’s large landowners have corrected nearly 8500 fish passage barriers and reopened 5200 miles of fish habitat since 2001 under the Washington Road Maintenance and Abandonment Plan (RMAP) process.

Those landowners were recognized by the state Forest Practices Board for their investments in protecting clean water for humans and fish alike.

That included the City of Hoquiam work.

Hoquiam City Administrator Brian Shay spoke about the recognition at their recent City Council meeting and said that the recognition came after the state ordered the city to complete the work.

The Forest Practices Board established RMAP in 2001 requiring large landowners to bring all roads constructed between 1976 and 2001 up to current forest practices standards.

Originally the program had a deadline for completion by large landowners in 2016. However in 2011 the Board allowed for a five-year extension due to the economic impacts of the Great Recession.

The Board recognized the landowners that were granted extensions and completed their work under RMAP by the new deadline.

“The improvements made through RMAP represent one of the greatest successes of Washington’s Forest Practices Rules. Thanks to the collective work of the state tribes and landowners over a span of twenty years we have made massive strides to protect clean water and crucial fish habitats for future generations” said Commissioner of Public Lands Hilary Franz. “I’m honored to recognize these landowners today and the years of work they’ve completed to benefit our Evergreen State.”

Shay added that the city put in the efforts after recommendation from their city forester Loren Hiner.

RMAP has also resulted in about 31000 miles of forest roads being brought up to current forest practices standards and another 4000 miles of roads being abandoned.

West Nipissing Mayor Joanne Savage said her municipality is considering a “multitude of options” for the old Sturgeon Falls mill site and is looking forward to hearing ideas from residents once consultation sessions wrap up in the fall.

If results of public opinion are to be believed — the municipality has been presenting community feedback on its Former Mill Site Development Strategy web page — residents would prefer the former Weyerhaeuser property to be transformed into parkland and recreational area or adapted to accommodate housing.

“It will be interesting to see what the findings will reflect. And also what is the will of the community” Savage said.

“From there once that information is received council will have to initiate discussion and keep the public informed as the situation progresses.”

West Nipissing located 35 kilometres west of North Bay is an amalgamated municipality of villages and townships formed in 1999. Comprising a population of more than 14000 its largest town is Sturgeon Falls.

In late 2002 Weyerhaeuser announced it was dropping the axe on the corrugated paper plant the industrial cornerstone of Sturgeon Falls eliminating 140 jobs. The mill buildings were demolished shortly thereafter but the brownfield property has remained vacant all these years.

One comment on the mill site redevelopment public input page reads: “We need to go multiuse. I imagine low-rise accommodations with lobbies as space for small businesses and eateries with a big open green space and a path along the water that connects the marina to the mill site. Go ‘radical’ and become the example.”

Another reads: “Multiuse is crucial. A good blend of commercial residential and public space.”

The mill site — Savage describes it as an “eyesore” — was purchased from American forest products giant Weyerhaeuser in December 2020 for $156000.

At the time there was some pushback from councillors about the risk around purchasing a former industrial site and concerns taxpayers may be on the hook for any environmental remediation. But once environmental assessments were completed the purchase was given the go-ahead from council.

That doesn’t mean there won’t be further assessments needed later Savage said but those will likely happen after the property goes through a rezoning process.

“At the end of the day was it a worthwhile investment? Yes it was” Savage said. “And now it's an opportunity for West Nipissing to engage in the process and to provide their feedback.”

The political momentum to redevelop the site should come as some relief to people living near the old mill. Since the mill’s closure in 2003 the building had been left neglected with surrounding property left to run overgrown.

“In Sturgeon Falls people have a lot of pride and joy regarding the maintenance of their property and the maintenance of our community” Savage said.

“And every time you would drive by there you’d say ‘Oh well this would be a perfect area for a picnic site. This would be a perfect area for this or that would be a perfect area for that.’”

Upkeep of the property should change now that site is now entirely owned by the municipality as well as a wide stretch of greenspace along the Sturgeon River which Savage calls a “jewel” of a property.

The municipality will also continue to own and operate the power generator on site Savage said following a major capital investment in 2018 to install new turbines.

“Even though the investment was quite a few million dollars…there's still a return on the investment and to this day the municipality receives annual dividends” Savage said estimating the annual return to be in the neighbourhood of $350000. Those dividends Savage said are plowed back into municipal infrastructure projects.

This could be another big step in the transformation of Sturgeon Falls from a one-industry lumber town into a thriving economically self-sustaining community.

Savage said they’ve moved on from relying on the mill to diversifying enough where it can count on several small and medium-sized businesses to prop up the local economy.

Looking at it from a different perspective Savage said she hopes that the community’s story can not only be an inspiration to other smaller towns but also showcase the area to southerners who have maybe grown disenchanted with life in the big city.

“This is about making sure that people throughout the province know that there are communities beyond the greenbelt beyond Muskoka” Savage said.

“The North has a lot to offer as far as quality of life and that we're very blessed because we have the land base all these amenities that we can enjoy in our own backyard.”

Savage said she expects the final report on the site to be presented to council in October.",,,,,,

Williams-Sonoma posts strong second quarter,"SAN FRANCISCO — While many companies in the home furnishings world had uneven or rough recent quarters Top 100 retailer Williams-Sonoma Inc. reported a strong second quarter for FY 2022.

The San Francisco-based retailer whose brands include Pottery Barn and West Elm reported net revenues for the three months ended July 31 at $2.128 billion up 11.3% from 2021’s $1.948 billion for the same quarter. In two years Williams-Sonoma’s net revenues have grown 41.1%.

Two quarters into fiscal 2022 Williams-Sonoma’s net revenues are at $4.029 billion up 8.96% from the first six months of FY 2021’s revenue figure of $3.697 billion.

Earnings for the quarter came in at $267075 million up 8.5% compared to $246070 million in 2021’s second quarter while it earned a diluted $3.87 per share in 2022 vs. $3.21 during the quarter in 2021.

“The second quarter marks another quarter of strong performance delivering an 11.3% comp on the top line and earnings growth of over 19% to $3.87 per share” said Laura Alber president and CEO. “These impressive results reflect the strength of our multi-brand portfolio the success of our growth initiatives and the ongoing execution of the team. We continue to demonstrate our ability to perform by offering high-quality differentiated and sustainable products that our customers know and love. Our performance was driven by strong order fulfillment positive demand comps and our successful continued elimination of site-wide promotions.”

Based on these numbers Williams-Sonoma announced that it doesn’t need to adjust its financial guidance for the remainder of the year. The company noted that it is keeping its fiscal year 2022 and long-term financial outlook of mid-to-high single digit annual net growth increasing revenues to $10 billion by fiscal year 2024 and operating margins relatively in-line with fiscal year 2021 operating margin.

“I am very proud of this performance especially given the macroeconomic backdrop and the strong compares we were up against all while delivering an impressive 41.1% comp on a two-year basis” Alber said. “And it is this continued outperformance that gives us the confidence to reiterate our 2022 guidance and longer-term outlook today.”

Other than that flexible working and a sense of purpose are also important factors to attract and keep employees in their jobs. Additionally they want their employers to focus on retirement and health benefits reflecting their concerns for long-term financial security.

These are among the key findings in a survey of more than 5900 employees from six markets in Asia Pacific (APAC) namely Australia China Hong Kong India Japan and Singapore by WTW (NASDAQ: WTW) a leading global advisory broking and solutions company.

According to the survey although only 28% of employees in APAC are looking for a new role even those who plan to stay are open to offers. The number who are looking to leave their current employer is particularly high in markets such as Hong Kong (45%) Japan (43%) and Singapore (46%).

Pay and bonus is still key when it comes to attracting employees across all markets surveyed. They also cite factors such as job security flexible work career advancement and opportunities to learning new skills as the other reasons for staying with their current employers. Having a sense of purpose has also appeared in the top five attraction factors and top three retention factors in the region.

“These findings suggest that employees continue to job hunt and there’s a pressure for employers to find ways to better meet their needs particularly on issues such as wellbeing engagement skills development and career structure in order to tip the scales so that employees choose to stay” said Eva Liu Head of Strategic Development Health & Benefits Asia and Australasia WTW.

“ Employees across different age groups from baby boomers to Gen Z have indicated that a sense of purpose is an important factor that they look for in an employer.” Eva Liu | Head of Strategic Development Health & Benefits Asia and Australasia WTW

“Purpose is also one of the areas that matters most to employees and features as a key factor in creating a high performing employee experience in an organisation and is associated with exceptional business results” added Eva. “Employees across different age groups from baby boomers to Gen Z in our study have indicated that a sense of purpose is an important factor that they look for in an employer. Increasingly employees want to work for organisations and brands that have a clearly defined purpose and that they are aligned to. They also want to feel that people have equal opportunity to contribute their ideas and to see how their work connects to the bigger picture. With Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) actions becoming an increasing integral part of businesses organisations need to rethink and assess the ‘S’ agenda in their ESG commitments.”

Retirement and healthcare benefits also play an increasingly important role in employee decisions to stay or leave. In many markets in the region the importance of health and retirement benefits as attraction and retention tools has reached a 10-year high.

The survey revealed that 85% of employees are more likely to remain with their organisations when their benefits package meets their needs. When asked to rank their top three benefits retirement comes first or second across all six markets reflecting their employees’ concern for long-term financial security.

“Adding choice and flexibility to the benefits package can help signal to employees that they are being heard and go further to delivering on their needs. When this happens it’s a boost for employee retention. With a better understanding of how employees value their benefits and how their needs are changing companies have an opportunity to shape programmes that meet employees where they are and help boost workforce productivity.” said Eva.

This fifth biennial global survey is about employees’ retirement and health benefits their wellbeing and the steps they need to take to improve it and the ways they want their employer to get involved. The survey took place globally between December 2021 and January 2022. This executive summary reflects responses from 5970 employees from six Asia Pacific markets – Australia China Hong Kong India Japan and Singapore.

It’s a tough time for employees around the world. Health scares are still making their presence felt with consequences on not only physical but also mental and financial wellbeing; inflation is rising exacerbating financial stress for many; and travel restrictions supply chain issues and labour shortages are still disrupting business in many places.

It’s also a time of great upheaval when it comes to labour markets. Many employees are starting to question what matters most to them and look for new career opportunities.

The 2022 Global Benefit Attitudes Survey breaks down the key findings for employers across major markets in Asia Pacific and explores how they can use their benefit strategies to support their employees through this time of great change.

Key findings

Compensation — that is pay and bonus — is key when it comes to attraction. Job security paid time off flexible working and a sense of purpose are also important employee attraction and retention factors.

Wellbeing is an increasing concern — one in eight employees report issues in all wellbeing dimensions. While physical wellbeing has improved and emotional wellbeing marginally so many employees are seeing their levels of financial and social wellbeing deteriorate.

Financial wellbeing in particular has deteriorated. More than four in 10 employees (43%) say they live paycheque to paycheque a number that has jumped by 13 percentage points since 2019.

Next steps for employers

Continue to listen In such a fast-changing landscape it’ll be more important than ever to have your ears to the ground and ensure that you are delivering meaningful benefits that resonate with your workforce.

Be inclusive While overall the survey found that the majority of employees are satisfied with their benefits nonetheless some groups are in danger of being left behind. This includes women LGBT+ ethnic minorities and low-income groups. To bridge this gap employers can start reviewing benefits from a DE&I perspective with a specific lens for their own market.

Communicate A well-designed inclusive benefits package will only go so far if it’s not communicated in a way that employees can understand and use. What an effective communication strategy looks like will depend on many factors including company culture predominant work styles and workforce demographics.

Use technology With remote working being the norm for many organisations today it’ll be important to investigate whether a technology platform can help cover your organisation’s benefit delivery and administration needs.

Get innovative Flexible work is here to stay. How can benefits support this? Employers are getting innovative including work from anywhere options office supply subsidies and generous time off policies. Reshape your benefit strategy to highlight your new flexible work policies and amplify your desired culture around flexible work.

In response to rising consumer price inflation — reaching 6.1% year-on-year as of July — the French Parliament passed measures to help protect individuals’ purchasing power including several relating to employee benefits and compensation.

Key details

Social security retirement and disability pensions in payment as well as family allowances were increased by 4% effective July 1 2022. The monthly minimum wage (salaire minimum interprofessionnel de croissance – SMIC) was increased by 2.01% on August 1 to 1678.95 euros (€11.07 per hour) the third increase in 2022 following a 2.65% increase in May and a 0.9% increase in January. Indexation of the SMIC is triggered whenever consumer prices increase by 2% based the rate of inflation for households in the bottom 20% by income as well as any gains in purchasing power for workers with earnings equal to national average gross hourly wage.

The voluntary exceptional purchasing power bonus that employers may pay employees — previously known as the Macron bonus and now renamed as the value sharing bonus (prime de partage de la valeur – PPV) — was made permanent with some changes. The tax-exempt Macron bonus introduced in 2019 and annually renewed through March 2022 was available to employees earning under three times the SMIC in amounts up to €1000 per year (doubled if a profit-sharing agreement was in place or if there were under 50 employees). Under the new measures:

From July 1 2022 through 2023 employees earning below three times the SMIC may be paid an annual PPV of up to €3000 (doubled if profit sharing is in place or there are under 50 employees) not subject to income tax or social security contributions.



From 2024 all employees may be paid a PPV up to the same limits subject to income tax but not social security contributions.



The PPV may be paid in up to four quarterly installments to prevent it from replacing salary increases. Similar to the Macron bonus companies that choose to pay a PPV must do so for all employees though the amounts may vary by employee based on objective criteria (e.g. salary job classification working time).

From 2023 the implementation of profit-sharing agreements will be made easier. Companies with under 50 employees will be able to do so unilaterally (outside of a collective agreement) and an online application procedure will be available with profit-sharing templates.

From October 2022 employer social security contributions will be reduced by a flat rate based on employee overtime performed in companies with 20 to 249 employees (the amount to be defined by separate decree). In addition the income tax exemption on overtime for 2022 will be increased from €5000 to €7500.

Through 2022 employees may withdraw up to €10000 free of income tax or social security contributions from tax-favored employee savings plans (such as PER PEE and PERCO plans) for the purchase of goods or services.

Staff who accrue paid time off in the form of RTT* days between January 1 2022 and the end of 2025 would be able to sell accrued RTT days up to €7500 per year. This entitlement would include professional and managerial staff covered by hourly or daily flat-rate working time regimes (convention de forfait).

*Based on RTT (Réduction du temps de travail) agreements under which employees accrue paid time off (RTT days) based on hours worked exceeding the 35-hour workweek.

Employer implications

The bill received final approval and became law on August 16. The enhanced tax-favored bonus option — both the temporary basis through 2023 and the permanent version available to all employees from 2024 — presents planning opportunities for employers to reward and assist employees though may result in higher labor costs. The option for employees to sell RTT days could be attractive to employers that want to reduce the amount of RTT days accrued by staff in return for increased employee working time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd0d2NvLmNvbS9lbi1pbi9pbnNpZ2h0cy8yMDIyLzA4L3JlY2VudC1kZXZlbG9wbWVudHMtaW4tdGhlLW5hdGlvbmFsLXBlbnNpb24tc3lzdGVtLW5wc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Recent Developments in the National Pension System (NPS),"NPS is a social security scheme which was launched in 2004 for the Government employees and had opened to all sections in 2009. It is regulated by Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) and has emerged as a popular investment scheme aimed at saving for one’s retirement. As on 30 June 2022 the assets under management (AUM) under the NPS architecture had crossed INR 7 Lakh Crores (~INR 7.1 Tn or $95 Bn) with the subscriber base of over 16 Mn. This is quite a feat given the short span of time the scheme has been in existence for though it should be noted that most of the funds as well as the subscriber base pertains to the Government sector where membership is mandatory for most establishments.

Even though the NPS investment returns have been volatile over the last couple of years the longer term returns over 5-year and 10-year periods have continued to remain strong. For example balanced portfolios (1/3 each in Equity Government bonds Corporate Debt) have delivered returns exceeding 8% p.a. over the last 5-year period and touching 10% p.a. over the last 10-year period despite the short-term volatility. The annualised returns do vary across fund managers and different asset classes and the detailed performance can be accessed through this website.

The PFRDA is keen on ensuring that the penetration of NPS increases in the private sector as well since the current participation of just 1.6 Mn as on 30 June 2022 feels extremely low. Based on the findings from WTW's State of Retirement Benefits in India Survey 2021-22 while over 60% of employers now offer Corporate NPS on a voluntary basis the employee participation in the programmes remains around 11%. Further over a quarter of the corporate participants reported a take up rate of lower than 5%.

Some of the main reasons for employees to not participate in these arrangements continue to be that the plans are voluntary i.e. their take home pay will reduce in case they opt-in and long lock-in periods applicable for the significant portion of NPS corpus.

Having said this the PFRDA has been extremely proactive in taking various steps which would make the participation in NPS more attractive for private sector employees. We look at the recent developments in NPS and our thoughts on their potential impact.

Changes in investment phase

1.1 The first change that had been in the making for some time now has been a review of the fees for pension fund management. It was well recognised that an annual fee of 0.01% of AUM would not be sustainable and would eventually need to be reviewed so that the PFMs are able to provide a satisfactory level of service. The revised investment management fee (IMF) as a percentage of assets under management (AUM) effective 1 April 2021 varies across the level of pension funds where the fee for AUM slab over INR 150000 Cr. is 0.0467% and goes upto the maximum of 0.09% for AUM slab up to INR 10000 Cr.

These rates of IMF would be reviewed by PFRDA every 5 years. Despite the increase NPS continues to be one of the most low-cost pension scheme / long-term savings plans globally.

Further the PFRDA has made some changes and additions to the charges of other NPS related services with effect from February 2022. Notable ones are summarised below:

Changes and additions to the NPS related services charges Type of Charge Prior Charges Updated Charges Withdrawal / Exit charge Newly introduced charge 0.125% of the corpus (min of INR 125 and max of INR 500) Initial and Subsequent Contribution Upto 0.25% of contribution (min INR 20 and max INR 25000) Upto 0.50% of contribution (min INR 30 and max INR 25000) Initial Subscriber Registration INR 200 Minimum of INR 200 and Maximum INR 400 Service Charge of eNPS 0.1% of contribution (min of INR 15 and max of INR 10000) 0.2% of contribution (min of INR 15 and max of INR 10000) All Non-Financial Transaction INR 20 INR 30

1.2 The PFMs are now going to have more investment freedom under the equity portfolio as they will be able to invest in the top 200 stocks by market capitalisation as opposed to only the top 100 earlier. This will allow them to demonstrate their investment expertise by being able to invest in the mid-cap stocks as well and potentially increase market share by delivering better returns. The overall impact would be additional investment choice for individual subscribers.

It has also been mentioned that the PFMs will be able to invest in IPOs even though at this stage it is not clear as to what level of funds will be available for this category. As long as this allocation is maintained at manageable levels it is expected to benefit the individual subscribers as they are more likely to be able to experience the upside an IPO offers within the already diversified portfolio.

1.3 There has also been an increase in the foreign direct investment (FDI) limit in pension fund management to 74% from 49% which will hopefully attract additional managers leading to more options for subscribers and more competition within the PFMs. Both these aspects are likely to benefit the subscribers.

Structural changes within NPS

2.1 Change in lumpsum withdrawal limit:

The limit on the corpus amount for the mandatory annuitisation of 40% of corpus has been raised from INR 2L to INR 5L. This is a good move for the small savers to be able to get the entire tax-exempt lumpsum upfront and not end up with small pension amounts at the retirement age of 60 as this pension may not represent good value for money due to the fixed costs that will need to be factored in by the Annuity Service Providers (ASPs).

Based on current annuity rates annuitising the revised minimum corpus of INR 2L (=40% of INR 5L) should result in a monthly pension of about INR 1300. Previously this could have been as low as about INR 500 where INR 80k (=40% of 2L) was to be annuitised.

2.2 Increase in entry age for retired subscribers:

The other big change is the increase in the age at which subscribers are able to join NPS. The age limit has now been raised to 70 years and those who join between 65 to 70 years of age can continue to remain invested till the age of 75 years with a minimum lock-in period of 3 years. In case the subscriber wishes to exit before completion of 3 years 80% of the corpus will have to be annuitised and only the 20% remaining can be withdrawn in lumpsum. Further to make the NPS more attractive for those joining after 65 years of age the PFRDA has permitted allocation of funds up to 50% in equity.

In addition the current subscribers of NPS will also be able to continue in NPS till the age of 70 years by simply notifying the relevant stakeholders 15 days in advance of turning 60.

We feel that this is a bold step in ensuring that the individuals are able to exercise additional flexibility on when they choose to ‘retire’ or start drawing their benefits from the NPS. The PFRDA has also recognised the fact that individuals are living longer and therefore may wish to retire later than before. Providing this additional layer of flexibility is also a plus for the subscribers who can now plan based on their own specific circumstances.

2.3 Steps towards innovation and digitalisation:

The regulator has also taken steps towards a major digital revamp by automating the compliance process. A new digital solution will be implemented in the year 2022 which will speed up the response time through process automation protect subscriber’s interest and integrate seamlessly with compliance and risk focused supervision.

Further PFRDA has also allowed Central Record-Keeping Agencies to use the penny drop process to validate and register the active savings bank accounts of the subscribers. This change has been implemented to address the failures / delays faced in crediting the subscribers’ accounts on withdrawal due to various reasons like incorrect or mis-matched bank account details.

The NPS is also in advanced stages of implementing a Minimum Assured Return Scheme (MARS) which will provide a guaranteed minimum return to the subscribers hence reducing the market risk faced by the risk averse investors. This is expected to be implemented by the end of 2022 calendar year.

In conclusion it would be fair to say that the PFRDA has been a proactive regulator which has taken bold steps in order to promote the NPS offerings for private sector employees. The steps mentioned above along with the continued strong investment performance are likely to provide additional encouragement for employees to subscribe to NPS.

As part of the 2021 budget update it was announced that interest income on employee PF contributions in excess of INR 250K per financial year will also be taxed as per the marginal tax rate. Voluntary Provident Fund (VPF) contributions have been fairly popular thus far because of the relatively stable tax-free returns they used to offer. By removing the tax shield from the investment income the popularity of the VPF especially among the higher earners is likely to suffer with the NPS well poised as a strong substitute.

We will continue to monitor this space and share details in due course.",,,

DAHLGREN Va. – Leaders from Naval Facilities Engineering Systems Command (NAVFAC) Headquarters NAVFAC Atlantic and NAVFAC Washington were in attendance for the ribbon cutting of the latest Public Works Stores (PWS) functioning under the Fourth-Party Logistics (4PL) solution at Naval Support Facility (NSF) Dahlgren on Aug. 24.



Two 4PL stores are now open for business one located at NSF Dahlgren Va. and the other at NSF Indian Head Md. supporting public works departments in NAVFAC Washington’s area of responsibility. Each PWS is operated in partnership between General Services Administration (GSA) and W.W. Grainger Inc. and will accelerate procurement of mission-critical materials for NAVFAC Washington while also providing customer service directly on-site.



A 4PL solution integrates companies along the supply chain under a single point of oversight. With 4PL GSA acts as a facilitator of suppliers and provides materials through a retail storefront with vendor-owned and vendor-managed inventory on-site. The 4PL program operates as the single contact for the flow of materials financial data and other pertinent information to the customers.



The 4PL PWS at NSF Dahlgren is just the latest in a series of stores opening across NAVFAC’s various areas of responsibility. The goal is to open dozens of such stores in order to accelerate NAVFAC’s execution performance.



“We’ve been working on this since 2019 and getting all the different sites in place has been about a decade-long process” said Peter Lynch NAVFAC assistant commander for public works. “We have expanded this relationship to set up several stores within the continental United States and we also have projects coming up in Hawaii and example sites we’re going to try in Japan Spain and Italy. None of this would be possible without the great teamwork and partnership we have between GSA Grainger and the NAVFAC team. The speed agility flexibility customer service and good price points will serve NAVFAC well.”



The 4PL PWS at NSF Dahlgren will allow NAVFAC Washington professionals to engage on-site directly with commercial vendors to receive the customer support they need. The 4PL PWS requisitions industrial facilities utilities and transportation materials as well as office products and furnishings. Purchases are requisitions to GSA not acquisitions reducing workloads on the government purchase card program and contracting offices while also providing greater price discounts over the traditional retail model. The 4PL solution provides NAVFAC Washington professionals with flexibility to modify product lines and if the desired product is not in stock on-site order it at no additional shipping cost and receive it within two to five business days. 4PL is supported by a blanket purchase agreement catalog that includes over 1.1 million products.



“Availability timeliness and quality of material play integral parts in any command’s ability to accomplish the mission” said Samantha Ciaravino NAVFAC Washington supervisory program manager. “With the addition of the GSA 4PL store NAVFAC Washington has capitalized on various GSA and Grainger resources and material procurement opportunities. We look forward to fine-tuning this capability and leveraging the experience across our area of responsibility.”



NAVFAC is dedicated to meeting the United States Navy’s demand for a persistent and agile shore enterprise that provides mission capability to the Fleets supported commands and customers.



“This capability accelerates the timeline for delivery of critical parts and materials while also reducing the amount of time and effort our maintenance personnel had to spend on procurement” said Eric Hawn NAVFAC Washington commanding officer. “4PL facilitates similar purchasing freedom that many Americans enjoy with online ordering and delivery at home.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR1Y2suZGFydG1vdXRoLmVkdS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzL3R1Y2stYXBwb2ludHMtZml2ZS1uZXctbWVtYmVycy10by1ib2FyZC1vZi1hZHZpc29ycy1hbmQtbWJhLWNvdW5jaWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tuck Appoints Five New Members to Board of Advisors and MBA Council,"Two alumni were recently appointed as the newest members of Tuck’s Board of Advisors: Kinya Seto T’96 and Leela Srinivasan T’06.

WYNN,Wynn Resorts,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3N0cmF2ZWxlcnVzYS5jb20vdHJhdmVsL3d5bm4tbGFzLXZlZ2FzLXJlbm92YXRpb24tcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Review: 200 Million Dollar Revamp at the Wynn Las Vegas,"Wynn Las Vegas is known for having pushed the luxury envelope offering the ne plus ultra in hotel accommodations. So how does one go about elevating them further while still honoring the property’s legacy? If you’re Todd-Avery Lenahan president and chief creative officer of Wynn Design & Development you approach it less as producing rooms for a hotel and more as designing suites that bring to mind a tastefully appointed apartment in Paris’ 8th arrondissement.

The result of this $200 million reimagining of the elevator lobbies resort corridors and 2674 rooms and suites that comprise Wynn Las Vegas and the Wynn Tower Suites is a collection of bespoke spaces that beckon with a warmth not usually found in hotels no matter how elegant. Everywhere one looks there is something begging to be touched rubbed or felt: here a wall covered in eccentrically pleated silk known as Crepes Suzette; there a beautifully iridescent custom-embroidered drapery woven in India.

“As guests’ needs evolve we are constantly advancing details that exceed their discerning tastes” says Lenahan. “Our redesigned rooms are equal parts intimate and sophisticated.”

Objets d’art—terra-cotta sculptures of rams on Lucite stands Moroccan camel-bone chests handwoven African baskets—fill each room benefiting from the combination of ambient and architectural lighting. Floors of Michelangelo marble are covered in custom carpets. Editions of Josef Albers’ Homage to the Square hang on the walls while on either side of the bed black-and-white photos of the moon are suspended from the ceiling. Over in the Tower Suites floor-to-ceiling mirrors with clothing hooks allow the entry hallways to double as spacious dressing rooms while four-poster beds add a hint of cosseted intimacy.

Bathrooms highlight Lenahan’s gift for mixing design elements that in a vacuum might seem to be inherently masculine or feminine but when presented together are sublime. A brass étagère with leather-covered shelves separates magnificent twin vanities of burled walnut each with a huge mirror. Just inside the door a dresser of lacquered rosewood stands like a sentry.

Much of the furniture including the chairs and benches is on frames or bases that allow light to pass through while the media center and private bar are housed in polished bronze étagères that reach to the ceiling lending an air of considered permanence. An elliptical marble desk-cum-dining table extends out from the wall allowing guests seated there to be a part of the conversation look out the window or simply watch television with merely a swivel. Wynn Las Vegas president Brian Gullbrants says “The new rooms have a much more residential feel and are a perfect fit for those traveling for work leisure or a little bit of both.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vaWdhbWluZ2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9jYXNpbm8vaW50ZWdyYXRlZC1yZXNvcnRzL2FkZWxzb24td3lubi1mbG91cmlzaGVkLWluLW1hY2F1LWJ1dC10aGVpci1yaXZhbHJ5LWZvdW5kZXJlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Adelson Wynn flourished in Macau but their rivalry foundered,"New gaming law mainland China’s anti-gaming policies revive debate over which mogul got Macau right Muhammad Cohen reports

Amid the challenges of Covid and Macau’s new gaming law alongside Beijing’s efforts to curb gambling this year’s twentieth anniversary of the city’s casino liberalisation has gone not just uncelebrated but virtually unnoticed.

So much that’s happened over these two decades in the world’s pre-Covid casino hub has been unexpected. Back in 2002 Atlantic City and the Las Vegas Strip dueled for global casino revenue supremacy while Cotai was swampland flanking a lightly traveled causeway.

One widely anticipated phenomenon failed to materialize. When Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands were announced among Macau’s casino concession winners in early 2002 it seemed inevitable that the rivalry between Steve Wynn and Sheldon Adelson that began in Las Vegas would reach new heights in Asia. Their profits surely did thanks to Macau (and in Adelson’s case Singapore too) but their competition fizzled for a variety of reasons.

“Was the rivalry real? You bet it was!” tourism and integrated resort development adviser Dr Andy Nazarechuk says.

Wynn’s city

Adelson bought the fabled Sands hotel in 1988 just as Wynn refocused on Las Vegas after selling Golden Nugget in Atlantic City – where he feuded with a casino owner named Donald Trump – and began construction of Mirage a resort that revolutionized the Strip.

“Las Vegas was Steve Wynn’s city and any new competitor was perceived as a threat to his status” Nazarechuk a casino executive and academic in Las Vegas for a quarter century recalls. “Steve Wynn was a charismatic leader who was always front and center in the media. Sheldon Adelson let his projects speak for him and didn’t allow any dissenting opinions to slow him down.

“Las Vegas was a relatively small town back in those days. There was no way to avoid confrontation between these two powerful leaders who both had big egos and iconic goals.”

Indeed when Adelson opened the Venetian across the Strip from Mirage he complained about Wynn’s noisy volcano erupting outside.

Dean Macomber a longtime gaming executive and consultant questions the depth of the rivalry. “Oh sure they paid attention to each other. Smart guys watch what other smart guys do: any smart guy not just an erstwhile rival. But did Wynn make a decision without considering Adelson or Adelson without considering Wynn? I don’t think so” Macomber whose resume includes a senior vice president stint at Venetian Macao says.

“Messrs Adelson and Wynn had enough vision chutzpah horsepower traction and vim and vigour to make their contribution without working formally or informally consciously or subconsciously in rivalry.”

Big enough for both of them

The Innovation Group senior vice president of international operations Michael Zhu notes sparring between Wynn and Adelson over Macau surfaced occasionally.

During one set of quarterly earnings calls during Macau’s early days he remembers “Mr. A claimed ‘bigger is better’ whereas Mr. W responded a few days after with ‘better is better.’”

Moments like that were rare though. “The primary reason is that the cake was big enough for everyone to have a decent slice” Zhu says.

Moreover Wynn and Adelson were eating from different sides of the Macau platter.

“The two companies have implemented different approaches to Macau and have focused on distinct segments but both have succeeded and accomplished their goals to a large extent at least prior to the Covid era” Zhu says.

“In Macau Adelson and Wynn already knew that the integrated resorts they built didn’t compete but complemented each other” Nazarechuk says.

Starting with the venerable Golden Nugget gaming hall downtown Wynn added Vegas to the luxury travel map. Much is made of Wynn’s design and image making skills – “Wynn did magic and created dreams” Macomber says – and not enough of the business genius behind it intended or not.

Making customers feel rich

Overthrowing the model of cheap rooms and eats to feed the casino transformed every part of the property into a potential profit center. Rather that subsidizing each visitor and hoping they’d spend on the casino floor Wynn invited everyone to spend in a place that made customers feel rich.

“The Wynn experience had cachet” Macomber says after years of competing against it. “It was perceptible and people would pay extra for it to be able to talk about it to others.”

Perhaps most important offering a luxury product encouraged rich people to visit. Rich people by definition can spend more than other people whether it’s at a restaurant a store a spa or a baccarat table.

Serial entrepreneur Adelson came to gaming via the travel business and then conventions. He built his own hotel because he felt Las Vegas incumbents treated him and his convention clients shabbily. Adelson’s MICE-based integrated resort model evolved from the Wynn template with businesses paying for rooms and meals freeing guests to spend on gaming and shopping.

Macau wanted each of them to bring their models there.

“Wynn’s properties were viewed rightfully as the best in the world” Nazarechuk says. “Who wouldn’t want a Wynn property in a new and growing market? Wynn’s past experience with the Chinese market in Las Vegas and his ability to attract the largest industry whales ensured his own success in Macau.”

Sands in Macau

Sands won its place in Macau on the strength of its convention focus but Adelson and his team on the ground – during the 2001-02 concession bidding and evaluation Adelson was largely sidelined with the onset of neuropathy a nerve ailment that persisted until his death last year at age 87 – saw the larger compelling opportunity.

Adelson was able to “do the math and make an early critical conclusion that Macau was family to the PRC and casino gaming not available to the 1.3 billion or so Chinese citizens at the time” Macomber says. “He wanted to pick up the Las Vegas Strip and drop it down in Cotai” the then-unfinished landfill linking Macau’s outer islands of Coloane and Taipa. Adelson’s key Macau strategies were“capacity capacity capacity” Macomber says and creating it fast.

Hold ups and delays

Adelson opened Sands Macao in May 2004 Venetian Macao in August 2007 the adjacent Four Seasons Plaza complex a year later and was building what became Sands Cotai Central now morphed into Londoner when the global financial crisis of 2008-09 halted progress temporarily. Today Sands still has as many guest rooms in Macau as its casino rivals combined.

Wynn on the other hand delayed beginning construction as he pressed the Macau government to allow gambling debt collection through courts which it eventually did (though gambling debts remained unenforceable legally in mainland China) and tax deductions for unpaid debts which it did not. Wynn Macau didn’t open until September 2006 more than four and half years after the concession grant and more than two years after Sands Macao.

University of Macau business economics professor Ricardo Siu says “clear differences in market positioning” were on display in local TV coverage of the openings of Sands Macao and Wynn Macau. At Sands’ mid-afternoon opening a mob pushing against the locked doors led security officers to tear them down. Within minutes the escalator up to the gaming floor broke overloaded with people riding three and four to a step. The late night opening of Wynn Macau was far less crowded by design enabling Steve Wynn to “present a luxurious view of his property to the public with nice music and fireworks.”

Different personalities

Siu believes differences in strategy arose in part from Wynn and Adelson’s personalities. They arrived in Macau situated differently in the gaming pecking order and in their careers. Wynn brought a visionary reputation his ouster from Mirage Resorts more of a footnote than a blemish to be largely erased by his Wynn Resorts complex then under development on the Strip. Relatively new to gaming Adelson had more to prove and ailing and over 70 when Sands Macao opened was likely in a rush to do it.

Entertainment formed a large part of Wynn’s reputation from Frank Sinatra at his Golden Nuggets in Vegas and Atlantic City (and in cheeky TV ads with Wynn) to Siegfried and Roy and Cirque du Soleil on the Strip. But Wynn didn’t bring that part of his portfolio to Macau and didn’t even open a theater there.

Cultural differences

“Vegas was built on entertainment” Nazarechuk says. “Macau is a different market and Steve Wynn knew this well. The only thing that the Chinese want to do is gamble. Wynn understood this and didn’t waste time effort or money trying to build a showroom that he knew wouldn’t work.”

Adelson on the other hand brought Macau a new Cirque du Soleil show built a 15000 seat arena plus more than 1 million square feet of MICE space and a shopping mall with another 1 million square feet more than Macau’s existing retail space inventory at the time. He wasn’t just tracing his Vegas blueprint but following Macau’s policy goal of creating a destination that offered more than gambling.

“Adelson’s MICE space at Venetian Cotai sat basically unused for years lounges and showrooms were well underutilized and activities for families were simply not needed” Macomber says. “Adelson was smart to build unused MICE space and an unused huge lake in front of Venetian Cotai if it earned him the right to build [the rest of the resort].” Wynn’s reputation alone had earned him that right.

Adelson or Wynn

In the current pre-dawn of Macau’s new era under the revised gaming law and Beijing’s reduced tolerance for gambling there’s more room to debate whether Adelson or Wynn’s approach was best.

“It was clear that the casino owner/operator who opened with the most capacity in the shortest amount of time would reap the greatest rewards in the first ten years after opening maybe more” Macomber says. “It is not as clear whether doing so after those halcyon years was the best strategy or not for Macau or the casino owner and shareholders – Covid and geopolitics make doing so more risky.”

“Within the context of the new gaming law in Macau while Wynn Macau may not be able to cover a wide scope of mass tourism the focus on ‘attracting new foreign visitation’ [for potential tax reductions] may become something they are good at” Zhu says. “They have arguably the best resort products in the Macau market.”

“If Wynn does not adjust its business strategy to follow Macau’s overall trend of mass market development it is quite likely that its market share may fall” Siu says. “However on top of maintaining its high-end brand Wynn has also been cultivating the mass segment in one way or another over the last decade although it may not be interested in low-end mass.”

Different approaches

The Macau native adds that Adelson and Wynn’s “different approaches could be beneficial to Macau’s development plan” giving visitors options created by two of gaming’s leading modern visionaries.

“No one knows what will happen in Macau in the long run but a Wynn property will always be desired to maintain a quality image” Nazarechuk says. “The LVS properties are the heart and soul of Macau. Both concepts will succeed in the long run but it is a painful time right now for all concerned.”

Well before Covid the rivalry between Adelson and Wynn expired in Macau from natural causes. While rivalries arise for a variety of reasons competitiveness sustains them. Once the global financial crisis passed and Cotai became Macau’s center of gaming gravity Sands far outpaced Wynn in gaming revenue vying with SJM and then Galaxy for the top spot while Wynn fought Lawrence Ho’s Melco for third place.

Between Sheldon Adelson and Steve Wynn personally the gap was even greater. Wynn’s wealth peaked in 2014 at US$3.8 billion according to Forbes. Adelson’s estimated wealth that year was US$38 billion.

Rivals? They weren’t even in the same league.

Wynn is partnering with Domain H. William Harlan — the Napa Valley wine magnate behind the wineries of Harlan Estate Bond and Promontory — for an ultra-exclusive wine dinner series. Priced at $10000 per person each reservation is capped at 20 seats.

On September 10 a multi-course dinner crafted by Mark LoRusso executive chef of SW Steakhouse and joined by Min Kim executive chef of Mizumi and Joshua Smith executive chef of Delilah will follow a champagne reception. Served in the private dining room at Delilah the six-course dinner is replete with all manner of seafood shaved truffle and Kobe beef and each course will be accompanied by a specially paired vintage wine from Harlan Estate.

In October Smith will plan a multi-course dinner at a to-be-announced location. Each course will similarly be paired with one of five vintage wines in Bond’s Grand Cru portfolio. Last in November Kim will prepare a multi-course dinner to be served at a yet-to-be-disclosed location with a pairing of Promontory wines.

The extravagant $10000 price tag includes not only wine — each bottle runs about $850 — and dinner. Also included in the ticket price for each event is a one-night stay in a Wynn Tower Suite room and immediate membership to the winery’s wine club in California.

Fred Haas is fed up.

“We will not allow sex trafficking in our community” he says. “It’s [about] the safety of our kids our daughters and our women.”

As the head of the department’s vice and gang unit he knows all too well that prostitution is not a new problem in Las Vegas.

But he says in recent years the violence surrounding it has skyrocketed.

On Thursday Haas took the issue to the Nevada Gaming Commission.

“It's becoming more aggressive against people in the casinos as they're looking for the next victim or they're looking for the next girl to turn out and make a prostitute” says Haas.



After more than an hour of testimony the board voted unanimously to add 44-year-old Kendrick Laronte Weatherspoon to Nevada’s so-called ""Black Book"" a list of people permanently banned from Nevada casinos.

The reasons cited include Weatherspoon’s history of violence against women. Police say that includes forcing his victims into prostitution along the Las Vegas Strip.

Mike Somps with the Attorney General’s office gave this example of what allegedly happened to one woman who changed her mind about working for Weatherspoon.

“He proceeded to grab her by the throat” Somps said. “She alleged he also punched her a number of times in the head where she eventually blacked out. When she came to he sexually assaulted her.”

Much of the information given to the Gaming Commission was kept confidential to protect victims’ identities but records show Weatherspoon has dozens of cases in the Las Vegas Justice System going back more than 20 years.

Todd Fasulo vice president of corporate security for Wynn Las Vegas said that while not all traffickers can be added to the “Black Book” this example sends a strong message.

“This should be strictly for the worst most violent criminal that preys upon a woman” says Fasulo. “And they become a victim most of the time through no fault of their own. And they use casinos to facilitate that crime.”

The “Black Book” typically includes people tied to organized crime and gaming cheats.

Weatherspoon’s addition as an alleged sex trafficker is different. But Somps says the list has always evolved.

“The types of individuals placed on the list over the years has changed depending on the problems of the time” he explains.

Weatherspoon was not at Thursday’s meeting to contest the decision.

If he enters any Nevada casino it’s an automatic gross misdemeanor and a trip to jail.

The last time any names were added to the list of excluded persons was 2018 when a cheating ring was busted at Bellagio."
XEL,Xcel Energy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNwci5vcmcvMjAyMi8wOC8yNC94Y2VsLWVuZXJneS1yYWlzZS1yYXRlcy1uYXR1cmFsLWdhcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Xcel Energy wants to raise rates for a climate-friendly gas system. Customers aren't happy.,"Over the last week Xcel Energy's vision for a climate-friendly natural gas system has received its first test before the public and Colorado utility regulators.

The reception so far has been chilly.

On Thursday the Colorado Public Utility Commission heard public testimony in response to a request seeking $188.6 million in rate increases company executives say are needed to kickstart its plan to eliminate the climate-warming effects of its natural gas system by 2050.

If approved the company's 1.4 million natural gas customers would see their average monthly gas bill rise by $4.16 in November. An additional $1.83 rate hike would pile on in November 2023 followed by a $2.15 increase in 2024. The rate increases would total about $8.13 extra per month for the average customer according to Xcel’s filing.

To help achieve the net-zero goal the Minnesota-based utility plans to invest in better-insulated buildings pipeline leak detection and novel technologies like mixing hydrogen into the natural gas supply.

A separate portion of the rate increase proposal would finance large-scale projects to upgrade the natural gas systems in Blackhawk Granby and Winter Park. Xcel Energy also plans to use the money to link new homes to the natural gas system.

During nearly two hours of testimony Xcel Energy customers and environmental advocates blasted the company for promising to combat climate change while investing in new fossil fuel pipelines. Many commenters noted natural gas is mostly methane a greenhouse gas that’s 84 times better at trapping heat than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period.

""We are past the point where we can ignore the dire effects of climate change in Colorado and the Mountain West"" said Denver resident Phillip Beck. ""Xcel simply should not be continuing to invest large sums into natural gas.""

Much of the testimony was dominated by public concern about ""stranded assets"" a term describing property or equipment that loses value due to new regulations technology or market forces. In the case of investor-owned utilities like Xcel ratepayers have been left paying the debt on coal plants long after they provide them any benefit.

Xcel Energy's Comanche Generating Station in Pueblo — the centerpiece of a separate case before regulators — could become a prime example. When the company built added $1 billion coal-fired unit in 2010 it planned to operate the facility until 2070. It's now reached a settlement to shutter the power plant at the end of 2031.

""Xcel is trying to do the same thing with their gas system"" testified Leslie Glustrom a long-time critic of the company and founder of Clean Energy Action a green energy advocacy group. ""Their plan is to spend first and then laugh all the way to the bank.""

The rate increase wouldn't be the first price bump approved this year. Regulators signed off on an electricity rate hike in March and allowed the company to charge customers to recoup unprecedented natural gas costs from a 2021 cold snap.

If the latest natural gas rate hike is approved the company estimates the average Colorado household should expect their combined monthly and electricity bill to jump by more than $16 over the course of 2022.

Joe Pereira the deputy director of the Colorado Office of the Utility Consumer Advocate said those price hikes don't account for rising natural gas prices which have inflated energy bills 40 percent beyond pre-pandemic prices. He says the reality has brought new scrutiny to what would otherwise be a ""status quo"" proceeding. Colorado regulators have granted Xcel Energy three rate increases in the last four years.

""The public and regulators have been able to tolerate Xcel's investments level but now that the commodity prices have shot up it's laid bare that the company has been spending considerable amounts on infrastructure"" Pereira said.

Pereira's office has lobbied regulators to deny the automatic rate increases in 2023 and 2024. It has also argued that the company's plan to expand its natural gas system could hurt low-income energy customers.

The reasoning comes back to climate change. Federal and state policies have established new incentives to help homeowners switch from gas to electric appliances which take advantage of booming wind and solar energy.

If higher-income customers make the switch first less wealthy households could end up stuck with the cost of maintaining the natural gas system. Pereira said the problem could grow worse if Xcel Energy continues to add more pipelines as higher-income customers electrify their homes.

""Any investment related to infrastructure needs to be scrutinized because those costs are likely to be borne by customers"" Pereira said.

In testimony presented to the commissioners Luke Litteken a vice president for gas operations with Xcel Energy insisted the company isn't ready to ditch fossil fuels. Federal data shows neutral gas heats 70 percent of Colorado homes. If every building switched electricity he said it would need to triple its current peak electric capacity in Colorado.

But commissioners did not appear receptive to the point. John Gavan responded to Litteken by recalling a visit to Colorado Mesa University in Grand Junction which has ditched natural gas heating in favor of geothermal electric heat pumps.

""I think you are vastly underestimating the maturity of these technologies"" Gavan said.

Public hearings on the proposed rate increase wrap up next week. Utility watchdogs don't expect a final decision from commissioners for another three to four months.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vc29sYXJpbmR1c3RyeW1hZy5jb20vYW1icmkteGNlbC1lbmVyZ3ktcGFydG5lci1vbi1lbmVyZ3ktc3RvcmFnZS10ZWNobm9sb2d50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ambri Xcel Energy Partner on Storage Technology,"Ambri a long-duration energy storage provider is teaming up with Xcel Energy to use its Solar Technology Acceleration Center (SolarTAC) to demonstrate Ambri’s energy storage technology. Ambri’s Liquid Metal battery energy system will support Xcel Energy’s renewable energy and economic development goals.

“We are honored to be selected by Xcel Energy as they continue to drive towards a carbon-free future” says Adam Briggs chief commercial officer at Ambri. “Partnering with a progressive and innovative utility such as Xcel Energy is an exciting opportunity for Ambri as their clean energy vision is directly aligned with our mission to leave the planet a better place for future generations.”

Xcel Energy is looking to Ambri’s Liquid Metal battery technology to help achieve its clean energy goals as the company installs more renewable energy and retires coal plants. Its energy plans are expected to reduce carbon emissions at least 80% by 2030 (from 2005 levels) and achieve a net-zero energy future by 2050 while delivering reliable affordable energy service.

Sun Valley residents hope so,"Residents along with Historic Denver submitted an application to the Colorado Preservation Inc. nominating the plant for 2023’s Most Endangered Places list.

Sun Valley residents are still working to preserve the Zuni Generating Station near the South Platte River and they're hoping an Endangered Places nomination will help.

On Monday residents along with Historic Denver submitted an application to nominate the site for the Most Endangered Places list that is published annually by Colorado Preservation Inc. or CPI a nonprofit that advocates for the preservation of historic places through out the state.

""We have been actively advocating for community engagement in these conversations about how this site would proceed with the owners and having the owners have those discussions with the community"" said Shannon Stage the manager of grants and preservation services at Historic Denver. ""[The nomination] elevates the need for those conversations to be had.""

Since the program's inception CPI has highlighted 130 historic sites several of which are in Denver or Denver County. Within those sites 52 are considered ""saved"" including Cranmer Park's historic sundial and terrace. According to CPI's website seven sites have been lost including the Currigan Exhibition Hall that was demolished in 2002 to make way for the Convention Center.

While a place on the Most Endangered Places list is a tool for preservation it's not the same thing as an historic landmark designation. It is possible for the community to apply for a landmark designation but Stage said that currently isn't on the table.

The goal with the Most Endangered Places nomination is to shed light on a place that people feel may be in danger of being lost. The idea is that if leaders are aware of the site they may focus on preserving it.

Which is what Sun Valley residents are looking for.

The 120-year-old Zuni site has sat idle since 2015. In the years since residents have expressed interest in reusing the plant and turning it into a public market that would include a farmers' market-type space with access to fresh food and booths for local entrepreneurs.

However Xcel Energy which owns the site planned to demolish the structure and possibly create a new substation.

Once residents and community leaders became aware of Xcel's plans Denver City Council and Historic Denver sent letters to the energy company last fall asking them to pause their demolition project and to work with residents on the future of the site.

Since then Xcel and residents have met and Xcel said they would halt all demolition for at least a year.

Stage said the letters brought attention to the situation and an Most Endangered Places nomination would bring even more awareness.

""It holds Xcel to same level"" Stage said. ""We need to have those conversations [...] So the nomination is really to create a mechanism for those conversations.""

Even if CPI nominates the Zuni plant Xcel can still do what they want with the site. But residents are hoping if the nomination pulls through it would give Xcel more reason to consider their voices.

""It elevates the situation to a higher level of priority so we can bring the community the owner and city officials together to have this conversation"" Stage said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvYWEuY29tL25ld3MvY292ZXJpbmctY29sb3JhZG8vcHVlYmxvLWNvdW50eS1hbm5vdW5jZXMtcGxhbnMtZm9yLWVjb25vbXlzLWZ1dHVyZS1hZnRlci1jb2FsLXBvd2VyLXBsYW50LWNsb3N1cmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pueblo County power plant settlement outlines plans for economy's future,"PUEBLO COUNTY — The Pueblo Board of County Commissioners announced the final settlement in the closure of the Pueblo-based Comanche 3 coal-fired power plant.

Last year Xcel Energy agreed to close down Comanche 3 in 2031 nine years earlier than originally planned. The plant brings in about $30 million annually for the county through property tax revenue prompting discussion on how to keep the county's economy running once the plant is closed.

In the settlement the Colorado Public Utilities Commission agreed to pay the county community assistance payments in the same amount of property tax lost for 10 years after the plant's closure. That tax revenue pays for 70% of the county's 1A capital investment projects which were approved by voters in 2016 including the Pueblo Riverwalk extension.

The settlement offers an incentive for Xcel Energy to stay in the county reducing property tax payments if the company invests in a new renewable energy plant in the area.

""This is a historic settlement that places Colorado as a leader in the efforts to save our planet and climate change. It provides deep carbon emission cuts and closes the last coal plant in the state of Colorado"" said Pueblo County Commissioner Garrison Ortiz.

Xcel Energy said it plans to retrain and transfer employees of the plant to different jobs in the company.

Dr. Velma Campbell is a Pueblo resident and has been a climate activist for the past 40 years. She said the future for the county's renewable energy scene is bright.

""We've been widely recognized as a part of the United States that has the solar resources. We have free energy generation going on in the sky right above us and lots of open space for solar panel development"" she said.

The closure of Comanche 3 ends Xcel Energy's use of coal in Colorado. The company has already invested in solar energy in the county as a replacement for when Comanche 1 and 2 close in 2025.

""We have two solar farms that are being built here in Pueblo to provide that generation and solar farms with battery storage to take the places of unit one and two"" said Ashley Valdez area manager of community and local affairs for Xcel Energy.

The company has not outlined plans for what renewable energy source would take the place of Comanche 3 but Valdez said wind and solar energy are big contenders.

Pueblo County hopes to achieve 100% renewable energy power by 2035 according to its 2020 Community Energy Plan.

Polk St.

Center City matched a gift given by Xcel Energy to replace all 850 incandescent bulbs with energy-saving and long-lasting LED bulbs installed by SkyRite.

The LED project is part of an effort to update the sign which was restored 16 years ago.

“The Paramount sign is an icon of not only downtown but for all of Amarillo” said Charles Lynch president of the Amarillo Historical Preservation Foundation which restored the sign with Center City’s help in 2006. “It’s a throwback to a time when Polk Street was brilliantly illuminated with neon from end to end and it’s a striking symbol of a downtown redevelopment effort that is paying off big for Amarillo. We’re grateful for Center City Xcel Energy and SkyRite for investing in the future of one of our most treasured landmarks.”

The Amarillo Historical Preservation Foundation will pay for the ongoing maintenance of the sign while Polk St. Paramount will pay the monthly cost of keeping the Paramount sign illuminated.

The 850 yellow and clear flashing bulbs that spell out Paramount on each side of the sign will be replaced with LED bulbs.

According to Xcel energy switching to LED lights provides a brighter light that uses 75% less energy and the bulbs last up to 15 times longer.

The release states that through using LED lights the monthly cost of lighting the sign and annual costs of sending a repair crew to change burned-out bulbs will be reduced.

The sign is one of the few remaining relics of the original Paramount Theatre that opened April 21 1932 during the Great Depression.

“The restoration of the iconic Paramount sign was a catalyst project for our downtown” said Beth Duke executive director of Center City of Amarillo. “The sign became an instant landmark and inspired others to revitalize Center City. When you see the Paramount sign you know you’ve arrived in historic downtown Amarillo.”

And while the virtual wedding event itself will be invite-only (wedding guests will receive NFT invitations) the celebration will still be a marketing opportunity for Taco Bell because fans can hang out in the Cantina and public reception room in Decembraland to access the public part of the celebration.

Yum Brands first submitted trademark applications for the metaverse in March though until now the company has not made too much of a splash in Web 3.0 (Taco Bell developed its own line of NFTs in 2021 and Pizza Hut launched a brief experience in May at the virtual event Complexland which gave fans the chance to win free pizza for a year).

Beyond the virtual wedding the Taco Bell virtual Cantina in Decentraland will continue to live on after the event as fans will be able to “interact with the brand in new innovative ways” within the metaverse.

Armstrong comes to the sandwich chain from The Wendy’s Co. where he served as head of international operations. Before then he worked for McDonald’s most recently as vice president and general manager for the Greater Boston and Columbus area. His resume also includes time with Yum Brands as a training manager for Central America and the Caribbean.

Jim Holthouser CEO of Schlotzsky’s parent Focus Brands says Armstrong’s “track record of operational excellence is invaluable as Schlotzsky’s continues to grow and enter new markets.”

In addition Shelley Harris was promoted to Focus Brands’ restaurant category president. Harris has worked in operations for the restaurant company for six years most recently as senior vice president of operations for the restaurant category. Before joining Focus Brands she spent nearly 13 years in operations at Burger King.

Chili’s is going to stop giving away so much free food.

That’s one of the changes coming to the 1600-unit casual-dining chain under new CEO Kevin Hochman who unveiled on Wednesday a series of “interventions” at Chili’s that are intended to help improve flagging sales and profits.

Same-store sales in the chain’s fiscal fourth quarter rose just 0.3% and traffic declined as some guests recoiled from rising inflation executives of parent company Brinker International said. Restaurant operating margins for both Chili’s and sister concept Maggiano’s meanwhile fell nearly 7 points to 10.3% as Brinker absorbed commodity price inflation of 15%—its highest for the year.

But Hochman has a plan. On his first earnings call since replacing outgoing CEO Wyman Roberts in June the former Yum Brands executive detailed a variety of strategies intended to help Chili’s boost its margins.

More value fewer discounts

The first order of business he said is to increase sales. One way to do that is by cutting back on discounts. Hochman said 37% of Chili’s checks include some sort of discount.

“We give away a lot of free food in our My Chili's Rewards [loyalty program]” he said. “There's probably a better way to do that and still maintain the traffic that that drives without constantly giving away free food every week.”

He wants the chain to instead pursue more of a “barbell” strategy promoting value for lower-income customers while encouraging trade-up among guests who can afford it. The idea has become prevalent among sit-down chains including Red Robin and Denny’s as they look to appeal to price-conscious guests.

At Chili’s it will include more emphasis on its 3 for Me value offer which features a drink appetizer and entree for $10.99. The brand will shift marketing dollars away from its loyalty program and virtual brands to focus more on the meal deal in order to drive traffic—a technique Hochman is familiar with from his quick-service days.

“One of the lessons in QSR is if you're going to have a great value you’ve got to make sure that you talk about it” he said. “And quite frankly we've been a little bit invisible in our business the last few years and we need to get back on air once we're ready to do that.”

It will also update its My Chili’s Rewards program to focus more on “compressing the time between visits” rather than free giveaways Hochman said.

An 8% price hike planned for the current quarter should likewise give sales a boost. Chili’s will maintain the 8% rate throughout the year which could involve additional incremental hikes CFO Joe Taylor said.

Menu moves

At the same time Chili’s plans to ramp up menu innovation particularly at the bar which will get a revamped food and drink lineup that Hochman believes will drive more transactions.

In other menu tweaks Chili’s next week will start offering items served by its delivery-only chicken wing brand It’s Just Wings on the core Chili’s menu. Applebee’s recently did the same thing with its virtual brand Cosmic Wings.

“The core Chili's does about 24x the sales of It's Just Wings” Hochman said. “So why not take these amazing flavors and these amazing curly fries and put them into the Chili's business as a premium at the bar?”

By the same token Chili’s chicken tenders will join the It’s Just Wings lineup to offer guests more selection without adding new SKUs.

Speaking of SKUs Chili’s plans to cut back there too. One place that will happen is It’s Just Wings which will drop the less popular smoked wing option from its menu. Maggiano’s virtual brand Maggiano’s Italian Classics is also due for a pruning Hochman said: It currently accounts for 26 unique SKUs but only 2% of the Italian chain’s business.

“We’ve got to make sure that we cut that number probably by more than half” he said.

Chili’s will also eliminate other low-selling or redundant menu items as well as unneeded dishware he said.

Simplification

The right-sizing will extend to operations too. “There's just a lot of tasks that we do in the back of the restaurant that don't necessarily help the guest experience and can be frustrating for team members” Hochman said.

One example: A process called portioning which involves counting out individual servings of proteins before a shift bagging them and storing them in a cooler for later. While touring the chain’s restaurants recently Hochman said an employee questioned why they were spending so much time counting shrimp.

“I said ‘Well how would you do it?’” he recounted. “And they said ‘When the customer orders a shrimp dish I would count eight shrimp and not do it before service’ right?”

He said the practice developed years ago to reduce waste doesn’t make as much sense now that many restaurants are short-staffed. Eliminating those kinds of processes could save the company years’ worth of labor costs annually he said.

Plus he said the streamlining efforts could have the added effect of making employees’ jobs more fun which could help address another problem: turnover.

Hourly staff turnover at Chili’s is still “much higher” than it was pre-COVID Taylor said. Weeding out rote tasks could help make workers’ jobs easier and more enjoyable enticing them to stay longer and in turn ensuring that restaurants have enough staff to meet demand. The chain recorded a 1% negative impact on sales in the quarter from capacity constraints caused by staffing shortages Taylor said.

Despite the wide-ranging strategy changes things are likely to get worse for Brinker before they get better. Food and beverage expenses are expected to rise more than $50 million in the current quarter which is typically its lowest revenue period for the year. The higher costs and lower sales will combine to generate restaurant operation margins of just 4.5% to 5.5% Taylor said.

But he said the anticipated “disappointing start” to the new fiscal year will give way to improvements later on.

“We maintain a clear line of sight to meaningfully improved operating performance throughout the year as incremental pricing lower food and beverage costs and sales-driving initiatives all kick in during subsequent quarters” he said.

While both vegan “ meat” companies have made strides in helping to grow the availability of vegan options on the market recently it seems like the latter of the two brands might be struggling to deliver: Both the stock price and multiple quiet rollouts of Beyond Meat fast food products could indicate challenges for the brand.

A brief history of Beyond Meat

Beyond Meat founded in 2009 actually started off with a failure reported CNBC in 2019. Chicken strips were the plant-based meat company’s first product which launched in 2012 and helped get the brand into major grocery store chain Whole Foods. However negative reviews from food critics combined with the success of the brand’s burger patties eclipsing the chicken strips were enough to lead Beyond Meat to discontinue the initial product.

Since then Beyond Meat has redeemed itself by introducing superior chicken tenders in restaurants. However even then the chicken tenders did not come without some struggle. Bloomberg reported in 2021 that the brand struggled to bring the product to market due to some internal issues involving both the formulation and uneven rollout of the tenders.

On the bright side Beyond has also had plenty of celebrity endorsements which have likely helped the brand expand its line up of products from chicken tenders and burger meat to ground meat sausage meatballs and jerky. This product expansion has also led to a number of partnerships with fast food chains and restaurants which is where Beyond Meat finds itself now— and it’s where other issues appear to have cropped up.

Beyond Meat’s adventures in fast food

In February 2021 Beyond announced a partnership with Yum Brands  owner of fast food chains KFC Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. Beyond Meat was set to create a number of new meat alternatives for each of the chains. None of these have been a roaring success in terms of development and launch .

For KFC Beyond Meat developed Beyond Fried Chicken a product that basically consisted of plant-based nuggets but which were c arefully not described as nuggets for some reason . Regardless of the name  this “ chick’ n” product took three years to debut nationwide yet did not earn a spot on the permanent menu ending the rollout after a couple months. (Maybe it will come back again soon?)

Beyond Meat’s collaboration with Pizza Hut followed a similar route. Starting off with a limited- time offering of Beyond Italian Sausage Pan Pizza that was successful enough to lead to a pepperoni option it seemed as though this plant-based offering would stick. Tests of the Beyond Italian Sausage began as early as 2020 but all of Pizza Hut’s Beyond Meat offerings were gone by March of 2021. Once again there’s no guarantee those offerings won’t return but regardless these collaborations feel notably brief.

In addition to its lackluster ongoing partnership with Yum brands Beyond Meat also collaborated with McDonald’s for the chain’s plant-based burger the McPlant. Unfortunately this plant-based patty did not seem to hook customers in its limited testing phase. McDonald’s ended its test of the McPlant this month and gave no indication of plans to launch it nationwide.

Beyond Meat at Taco Bell

Even more recently Taco Bell looks to be developing its own proprietary plant-based option. As part of its original partnership with Yum Brands Beyond Meat created a vegan carne asada for the Taco Bell menu. That item never went national though both Taco Bell and Beyond Meat have consistently emphasized that their partnership is ongoing and some sort of plant-based product(s) is still in the works.

“Creating something innovative and delicious takes time” Missy Schaaphok Director of Global Nutrition & Sustainability at Taco Bell told The Takeout via email. “ We bring care and consideration to every new venture and we’re excited to be partnering with Beyond Meat to introduce an industry first new plant-based protein before the end of 2022.”

Additionally  however Taco Bell has begun testing its own proprietary plant-based protein made from a soy and pea-based blend reports CNBC. Schaaphok says Taco Bell has been working on this proprietary meat alternative for many years. Because of that the timing of this in-house plant-based product’s debut doesn’t necessarily point to dissatisfaction with Beyond Meat; Taco Bell is simply doing both.

Beyond Meat is obviously still the leading player in the plant-based meat market ( consistently outperforming Impossible )  and as Schaaphok notes menu development can be a long slow process. But a s more consumers embrace these meat alternatives there’s not only an increase in demand but an increase in demanding customers: W ith so many players entering the game to compete with the leading brands  there’s no room for substandard flavor . To draw in flexitarians ( the target demographic for any plant-based brand ) the only option is to consistently deliver on great taste at a palatable price point .

Their work “High Subsidence Rate After Primary Total Hip Arthroplasty Using a Zweymüller-type Noncemented Implant With a Matte Surface” appears in the Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Global Research & Reviews.

Co-author Toshiyuki Kawai M.D. Ph.D. with the Department of Orthopedic Surgery Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine Sakyo-ku in Japan explained the genesis of the study to OTW. “Total hip femoral components of various materials and a multitude of designs are currently available. It is important to share surgical findings of less than good results in order to alert the public of possible issue with certain implants and to understand potential risk factor for early failure.”

“We had unfavorable results with a stem that had a widely used geometry but a relatively smaller surface roughness than stems with the similar geometry. This study included only 30 hips that were followed up only 6.3 years; however we thought we should share those results now to give a caution rather than waiting until we get 10 years or 15 years of results.”

The 30 total hip arthroplasties (THAs) (27 patients) employed the Elance stem (manufacturer: Kyocera) from September 2012 to October 2014. Surgical indications were as follows: osteoarthritis (OA) secondary to hip dysplasia (23 hips) osteonecrosis of the femoral head (5 hips) primary OA in one hip and rheumatoid arthritis in one hip.

“The survival rate of the Elance stem (a Zweymüller-type noncemented femoral implant) with stem revision for any reason was 86.4% (95% confidence interval 68.9%-94.8%) at 5 years” stated Dr. Kawai to OTW. “In comparison the control group (THA done using stems other than the Elance stem) had a significantly higher survival rate of 99.5% (95% confidence interval 96.2%-99.9%) at 5 years. Stem subsidence >5 mm was noted in 17 hips (56.7%) for the Elance stem. The survival rate with stem subsidence >5 mm as the end point was 46.6% (95% confidence interval 29.9%-64.2%) at 5 years.”

“The Elance stem had a sandblasted matte surface with a target Ra of 1.0 to 2.5 micrometers whereas the other Zweymüller stems had a higher roughness with a target Ra of 4 to 8 micrometers for SL-PLUS (Smith & Nephew) and Alloclassic (Zimmer-Biomet). This difference in surface roughness may have affected the initial fixation of the stem. A previous report described that an implant with a rough surface has a favorable effect on early and strong bonding to the bone.”

“According to previous reports the mean migration of SL-PLUS implants was 0.3 mm at 2 years. The survival rate for the Alloclassic stem with subsidence > 5mm as the end point was 88.5% at 12 years. Elance had a similar stem design (geometry) to Alloclassic and SL-PLUS but had a significantly poorer implant survival than them. One biggest difference was the surface roughness (1.0 to 2.5 vs 4 to 8 micrometers) which could have caused the early subsidence.”

“Hip surgeons need to be aware of the importance of surface topography of an implant even when the device had a widely accepted geometry that yielded an excellent long-term survival. This caution should also be for medical device manufacturers who are going to make modifications on an existing stem or to conceive a new prosthesis.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Responding to COVID-19 outbreaks at more than 200 mink farms the Danish government in November 2020 culled its entire mink population. The Danish armed forces helped farmers slaughter each of their 17 million minks which are normally farmed for their valuable fur.



The SARS-CoV-2 virus said officials spread from human handlers to the small ferret-like animals mutated and then spread back to several hundred humans. Although the mass extermination faced much criticism Denmark’s prime minister defended the decision last month stating that the step was “necessary” and that the Danish government had “a responsibility for the health of the entire world.”

Over the past two and half years COVID-19 infections have been reported in numerous animal species around the world. In addition to the Danish minks there is other evidence that the virus can mutate as it’s transmitted back and forth between humans and animals which increases the risk to public health. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) COVID-19 vaccines for animals may protect the infected species and prevent the transmission of viral mutations. However the development of such vaccines has been slow. Scientists attribute the deficiency to a lack of data.

“Several animal species have been predicted and found to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2” says Suresh V. Kuchipudi interim director of the Animal Diagnostic Laboratory at the Huck Institutes of Life Sciences. But the risk remains unknown for many animals in several parts of the world he says. “Therefore there is an urgent need to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 exposure of high-risk animals in different parts of the world.”

In June India introduced Ancovax its first COVID-19 vaccine for animals. The development came a year after the nation reported that the virus had infected eight Asiatic lions with two of them dying. While 30 COVID-19 vaccines for humans have been approved for general or emergency use across the world Ancovax is only the third such vaccine for animals. The first named Carnivac-Cov was registered by Russia in March last year followed by another vaccine four months later developed by Zoetis a U.S. pharmaceutical company.

Christina Lood a Zoetis spokesperson says the company has donated over 26000 doses of its animal vaccine to over 200 zoos – in addition to 20 conservatories sanctuaries and other animal organizations located in over a dozen countries including Canada Chile and the U.S. The vaccine she adds has been administered to more than 300 mammalian species so far.

“At least 75 percent of emerging infectious diseases have an animal origin including COVID-19” says Lood. “Now more than ever before we can all see the important connection between animal health and human health.""

The dangers of COVID-19 infections among animals

Cases of the virus in animals have been reported in several countries across the world. As of March this year 29 kinds of animals have been infected. These include pet animals like dogs cats ferrets and hamsters; farmed animals like minks; wild animals like the white-tailed deer mule deer and black-tailed marmoset; and animals in zoos and sanctuaries including hyenas hippopotamuses and manatees. Despite the widespread infection the U.S. Centres for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) has noted that “we don’t yet know all of the animals that can get infected” adding that more studies and surveillance are needed to understand how the virus is spread between humans and animals.

Leyi Wang a veterinary virologist at the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory University of Illinois says that captive and pet animals most often get infected by humans. It goes both ways he says citing a recent study in Hong Kong that found the virus spread from pet hamsters to people.

Wang’s bigger concern is the possibility that humans or domestic animals could transmit the virus back to wildlife creating an uncontrollable reservoir of the disease especially given the difficulty of vaccinating non-captive wild animals. Such spillbacks have happened previously with diseases such as plague yellow-fever and rabies.

In the past other human respiratory viruses have proven fatal for endangered great apes like chimpanzees and gorillas. Fearing that COVID-19 could have the same effect primatologists have been working to protect primates throughout the pandemic. Meanwhile virus reservoirs have already been created among other animals Wang says.

“Deer of over 20 U.S. states were tested SARS-CoV-2 positive” says Wang pointing to a study that confirmed human-to-deer transmission as well as deer-to-deer transmission. It remains unclear how many wildlife species may be susceptible to the disease due to interaction with infected deer says Wang.

In April the CDC expressed concerns over new coronavirus variants mutating in wildlife urging health authorities to monitor the spread of the contagion in animals as threats to humans. The WHO has made similar recommendations.

Challenges to vaccine development

Zoetis initiated development activities for its COVID-19 vaccine in February 2020 when the first known infection of a dog occurred in Hong Kong. The pharmaceutical giant completed the initial development work and studies on dogs and cats and shared their findings at the World One Health Congress in the fall of 2020. A few months later after a troop of eight gorillas contracted the virus at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park Zoetis donated its experimental vaccine for emergency use in the great ape population.

Zoetis has uniquely formulated its COVID-19 vaccine for animals. It uses the same antigen as human vaccines but it includes a different type of carrier protein for inducing a strong immune response. “The unique combination of antigen and carrier ensures safety and efficacy for the species in which a vaccine is used” says Lood.

But it’s challenging and expensive to develop and implement animal vaccines and demand has been lacking as the broader health risk for animals isn’t well known among the public. People tend to think only about their house pets.

“As it became apparent that risk of severe disease for household pets such as cats and dogs was low demand for those vaccines decreased before they became commercially available” says William Karesh executive vice-president for health and policy at EcoHealth Alliance. He adds that in affected commercial mink farms the utility of a vaccine could justify the cost in some cases.

Although scientists have made tremendous advances in making vaccines for animals Kuchipudi thinks that the need for COVID-19 vaccines for animals “must be evaluated based on many factors including the susceptibility of the particular animal species health implications and cost.”.

Not every scientist feels the need for animal vaccines. Joel Baines a professor of virology at Cornell University’s Baker Institute for Animal Health says that while domestic cats are the most susceptible to COVID-19 they usually suffer mild infections. Big cats in zoos are vulnerable but they can be isolated or distanced from humans. He says that mink farms are a relatively small industry and by ensuring that human handlers are COVID negative such outbreaks can be curtailed.

Baines also suggests that human vaccines could probably work in animals as they were tested in animals during early clinical trials and induced immune responses. “However these vaccines should be used in humans as a priority and it would be unethical to use a vaccine meant for humans to vaccinate an animal if vaccine doses are at all limiting” he says.

William Karesh president of the World Animal Health Organization Working Group on Wildlife Diseases says the best way to protect animals is to reduce their exposure to infected people.

In the absence of enough vaccines Karesh says that the best way to protect animals is the same as protecting unvaccinated humans - reduce their exposure to infected people by isolating them when necessary. “People working with or spending time with wild animals should follow available guidelines which includes testing themselves and wearing PPE to avoid accidentally infecting wildlife” he says.



The Link between Animal and Human Health

Although there is a need for animal vaccines in response to virus outbreaks the best approach is to try to prevent the outbreaks in the first place explains K. Srinath Reddy president of the Public Health Foundation of India. He says that the incidence of zoonotic diseases has increased in the past six decades because human actions like increased deforestation wildlife trade and animal meat consumption have opened an ecological window for disease transmission between humans and animals. Such actions chip away at the natural barriers between humans and forest-dwelling viruses while building conveyor belts for the transmission of zoonotic diseases like COVID-19.

Many studies suggest that the source of COVID-19 was infected live animals sold at a wet market in China’s Wuhan. The market sold live dogs rats porcupines badgers hares foxes hedgehogs marmots and Chinese muntjac (small deer) and according to a study published in July the virus was found on the market’s stalls animal cages carts and water drains.

This research strongly suggests that COVID-19 is a zoonotic disease one that jumps from animals to humans due to our close relationship with them in agriculture as companions and in the natural environment. Half of the infectious diseases that affect people come from animals but the study of zoonotic diseases has been historically underfunded even as they can reduce the likelihood and cost of future pandemics.

“We need to invest in vaccines” says Reddy “but that cannot be a substitute for an ecologically sensible approach to curtailing zoonotic diseases.”

Furthermore the countries composing sub-Saharan Africa have diverse needs. From unaffordable health care to regional conflict the issues besetting sub-Saharan Africa have left many of its inhabitants in poverty. Fortunately philanthropic organizations have stepped up to the plate to remedy the many challenges affecting sub-Saharan Africa. Three organizations in particular have shown that there is not a universal methodology for combating poverty in sub-Saharan Africa.

Poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa

According to the World Bank in 2017 two-thirds of the “global extreme poor population” lived in sub-Saharan Africa. While poverty is actually slowly declining in the region a rapid rise in population growth is stalling a reduction in the number of impoverished people in sub-Saharan Africa.

However there are differences among sub-Saharan Africa’s constituent countries. According to the World Bank’s 2018 data in the Democratic Republic of Congo 73% of people lived on less than $1.90 per day the international poverty line. Additionally the World Bank predicted that 27% of Ethiopians lived below the international poverty line in 2019. Finally a 2020 U.N. report indicates that 18.9% of South Africans live on less than $1.90 a day.

Agrarian Communities “Grow Together” with Nanmo

Nanmo is an Arabic word meaning “growing together.” This word is the spirit of the partnership between the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Qatar Fund for Development’s $200 million investment in sub-Saharan Africa.

Nanmo’s goal is to provide adaptive ways for rural farmers especially women to respond to climate-related difficulties. Mark Suzman CEO of the Gates Foundation told the Gulf Times that a “Majority of the poorest living in sub-Saharan Africa are the rural folk. They depend on agriculture…in parts of the world that are seeing much greater temperature fluctuation with frequent floods or frequent droughts.” The collaborative organization gives agrarian communities innovative technologies that can bolster their pathway to food security.

Suzman said that Nanmo was not confined to one country. However a pilot program in Nigeria and Ethiopia showed an auspicious sign for the future of Nanmo in combating poverty in sub-Saharan Africa.

Efficiency for Access: Ameliorating Poverty through Clean Energy Solutions

In sub-Saharan Africa more than 600 million people lack a connection to their country’s energy grid. Efficiency for Access a coalition coordinated by CLASP and Energy Saving Trust is working to bring life-changing clean-energy appliances to vulnerable communities.

Bridging the gap between those on and off the energy grid could lead to improved agricultural productivity and thus poverty alleviation. Mike Maina from CLASP told FairPlanet that “In sub-Saharan Africa 60% to 70% of the population is involved in agricultural livelihoods with the least mechanization in the world. This is a region where using renewable energy can have a big impact especially on low-income populations.”

In addition to agricultural appliances like solar water pumps Efficiency for Access also supplies products such as solar-powered refrigerators electric pressure cookers and fans. As CLASP conveyed to FairPlanet its theory is to provide people with a livelihood and not just a light bulb.

Zoetis Provides Veterinary Care to Farmers’ Livestock

Despite sub-Saharan Africa’s sizable livestock population it has the “lowest productivity per animal” of any region. According to Poultry World Zoetis an animal health company is improving the health of livestock through its A.L.P.H.A. initiative. Inaugurated in 2017 this program provides accessible veterinary services to farmers across the region.

Throughout its five years in operation Zoetis has worked with 128 million animals and educated 26000 individuals according to Poultry World. By supplying inoculations and medical training to communities in sub-Saharan Africa the African Livestock Health and Productivity Advancement program has been a boon for food security in sub-Saharan Africa.

Zoetis’s activity in the region has enabled African communities to produce safer food while reducing the economic burden of raising livestock. Thus the A.L.P.H.A. initiative has been successfully combating poverty in sub-Saharan Africa.

A Glimpse into the Region’s Future

These three organizations are just some of the numerous charitable entities working on combating poverty in sub-Saharan Africa. While these organizations exemplify a propitious future for the region it still requires more work.

Governments and NGOs alike need to work in harmony to ensure that the region’s sundry needs are met. However these three organizations demonstrate that there is no “one size fits all” approach to combating poverty in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite the need for more concerted and adaptable action on behalf of the world’s poor these three organizations provide a bright glimpse into the future for sub-Saharan Africa.

Africa: Anti-dumping duties suspended for some countries,"On 1 August 2022 South Africa’s Minister of Trade Industry and Competition announced a decision to suspend anti-dumping duties on poultry from Brazil Denmark Ireland Poland and Spain for a period of 12 months.

This says the minister is in light of the rapid rise in food prices and the impact that the imposition of the anti-dumping duties may have on the price of chicken.

According to the USDA although the Commission investigating dumping found that poultry originating in these countries was dumped into the Southern African Customs Union market and recommended the application of anti-dumping duties the Minister determined that “the imposition of these duties would have a negative impact on the poor”.

Poultry prices

The minister’s stated concern about the rising cost of food mirrors concerns related to the affordability of food felt across South Africa says the USDA report adding that various groups have called on the government to take action to reduce the cost of food. For poultry specifically several organisations have requested the removal of the 15% VAT a move which would benefit both imported and domestic poultry it said.

Poultry trade

Due to highly pathogenic avian influenza limiting exports from Europe Brazil is the only trading partner that will immediately benefit from the suspension of anti-dumping duties said the USDA.

The current anti-dumping duties imposed against US bone-in chicken meat exports to South Africa outside of the Tariff Rate Quota expire on 23 November this year. The commission will consider information submitted by local industry to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a further review or if the duties should expire as scheduled.

Disappointed expressed by South African Poultry Association

Izaak Breitenbach GM of the South African Poultry Association Broiler Organisation said that the local poultry industry is surprised by the announcement.

“The local poultry industry is sensitive to the plight of cash-strapped consumers and understands that food price inflation can negatively impact South Africa’s population. However poultry producers also feel that the minister’s announcement flies against the spirit of the Poultry Sector Masterplan which specifically listed tariff measures as an important pillar to put a stop to dumping” said Breitenbach adding that the latest decision seems to demonstrate that dumping is “okay”.

“Dumping doesn’t help South African consumers or farmers. In fact dumping can jeopardise food security. A healthy sustainable poultry industry is what South Africa needs – one that grows creates jobs invests locally and pays its taxes on profits generated.”

The decision he said will not assist the country’s efforts towards localisation job creation transformation plans investment or development of the rural economy. “In fact it may actively cause harm and will certainly disrupt industry investment plans for the foreseeable future. The Minister attributes the suspension on the implementation of the anti-dumping duties against the aforementioned countries on rising food costs and the potential impact on poultry prices. A causal link between trade measures to stem the tide of dumping and rising poultry selling prices must surely be established first?”

Breitenbach also noted that the South African Poultry Association believes that it is a misnomer to think the lack of anti-dumping tariffs will assist the consumer. “The Minister’s announcement merely provides the importers a reprieve for 12 months and any “cheap” chicken imports simply goes into the pocket of the importer as healthy margins… Once again the importers will capitalise on the opportunity by actively participating in unfair trade practices.”

Brazil’s response

According to the Brazilian government since December South Africa has charged extra tariffs from 6% to 265.1% in addition to import tax.

In a joint note Brazilian Ministries of Economy and Foreign Affairs have informed they maintained constant dialogue with producing companies investigated and with the South African authorities including through technical manifestations related to the investigation of dumping.

“The Brazilian government will remain attentive to the case in the expectation that the temporary suspension of anti-dumping tariffs will become definitive” the statement said.

Last year Brazilian exports to South Africa exceeded US$1 billion of which around 17% corresponded to exports of frozen chicken cuts.
