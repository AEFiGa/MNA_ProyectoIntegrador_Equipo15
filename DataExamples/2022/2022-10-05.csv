To make matters worse it can be challenging to justify the time and expense to do so and there’s little agreement on the ideal metrics and processes involved.

Still this is particularly important as chip architectures evolve from a single chip developed by one vendor to a collection of chips in a package from multiple vendors. The ability to identify security risks early in the design flow can save time effort and money on the back end of the flow. And in theory this should be the same as any other test or debug process. But hardware quality reliability and security have very different track records in terms of testing.

“We’ve done tests for quality for the past 50 years” said Mark Tehranipoor chair of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the University of Florida. “We’ve done tests for reliability for the past 25 years. And now we’re talking about tests for security.”

One of the key challenges on the security side is clarifying exactly what you’re testing for. While a chip may have been manufactured to detailed specifications its security has to be assessed through the mindset of a smart and determined attacker rather than through predictable metrics.

“You have to think about the intelligence of an adversary” Tehranipoor said he said. “We can model a defect but it’s extremely hard to model an intent. That’s where security becomes difficult to test for.”

No matter how many best practices are applied during the design phase the real world often presents security challenges that are hard to anticipate. “Once you’re out in the field all bets are off” said Adam Cron distinguished architect at Synopsys. “You’re at the whims of any hacker around the world and what his best practices are and what the new thing is coming down the line.”

Tehranipoor and Cron are two of the authors of a recent paper examining these issues “Quantifiable Assurance: From IPs to Platforms.” The paper lists more than 20 different metrics for different aspects of security which points to the complexity of the challenge. “Generally measuring security is still at a nascent place” Cron said. “All companies are just getting off the ground from a measurement standpoint for security in particular.”

Finding consensus around those metrics won’t be easy. “Over the past several years the [hardware security] community has been talking about developing metrics but we’re not quite there yet and we’re not going to be there any time soon” Tehranipoor said. “Why? Because by the time we figure out a good metric for some attacks a new attack comes in and we’re behind again.”

Agreeing on metrics

Just about any security metric could be rendered irrelevant by the right attack. A hypothetical device certified for high security could be breached by a highly intelligent adversary who happened to spot something others hadn’t. “If we all missed looking at it from the angle that this particular attacker looked it – we thought it was a really good secure device but this guy showed up and he looked at it in a certain way that we all missed – then suddenly there’s an easy attack” Tehranipoor said.

Texplained CTO and founder Olivier Thomas said any testing of IC security has to consider three classes of attacks – non-invasive semi-invasive and fully invasive. But testing for the latter often falls short. “Testing the first two classes is usually done pretty well as this does not require too much equipment resources and time. But when it comes to the fully invasive class the evaluations if conducted are really far from what pirates or organized groups are capable of” he said.

Moreover the wide range of ways any chip can be attacked presents a fundamental challenge. “I have to think about whether this chip is going to leak information through the pin through the software through the firmware through the JTAG or can it give it to me through power or EM or timing or optical or laser” said Tehranipoor. “There are so many ways and there is no single metric for all of them because laser is fundamentally different than power power is fundamentally different than EM. So how many different metrics are we going to have?”

Still Cron said there is a real push for a ratings system for consumer products as well as high-security solutions. This is akin to a UL listing for consumer appliances likely with a date stamp to indicate how up to date a chip’s security is. “You’ll know that at the time it was checked you achieved a certain level and there won’t be infinite levels” he said. “But if you buy that same product and it’s been sitting on the shelf for two years you have to ask yourself ‘Is it still good?’”

A range of approaches

In the meantime there are several ways to get a sense of a chip’s security. One involves Joint Interpretation Library (JIL) scoring. “JIL scoring tells you how ‘expensive’ it is to initially figure out an attack (identification) and how expensive it is to subsequently do the attack (exploitation)” said Maarten Bron managing director at Riscure. “This method was initially developed for expressing the security of smart cards (bank cards public transit cards SIM cards) and has recently gained wider traction in the domain of MCUs and SoCs.”

Cron noted that NIST has standards for certifying encryption or cryptographic IP and Synopsys’ RTL Architect can look at differential power analysis. “But there’s still no metric per se” he said. “Those tools are giving you areas where you should look. But whether or not you do look or whether or not while you look you detect the thing that the hacker is going to be looking at as well who’s to say?”

Scott Best senior director of security products at Rambus said that while each individual chip manufacturer approaches this with the best of intentions they all do things differently. “There is no one standard adopted for industrywide practice commercially” he said. “In U.S. Defense there are some early-stage guidelines coming together for Microelectronic Quantified Assurance (MQA) for example as part of the RAMP program.”

The diverse range of evaluation methods in use today according to Texplained’s Thomas includes analysis by researchers who publish at conferences and online independent analysis requested by OEMs and integrators seeking more information than that offered by vendors and Common Criteria security evaluations that only focus on some types of attacks “and therefore are not fully exhaustive.”

But that hasn’t diminished the need for this kind of standardization. “There are two broad key business drivers here” said Jason Oberg CTO at Cycuity. “One is obviously standardization. It’s very clear that if you can check a box someone is more likely to buy. If you sell in a certain market and if you have to do it that’s what’s standardization can help drive. The other component is really driven by customer demand for ‘I want a secure product.’ Or maybe they’ve had that crisis where it actually happened to them. And if you think about defining the systematic process when you have security requirements that are defined up front part of those security requirements are actually driven by standards.”

Shifting left

This is why there is an increasing amount of focus on security earlier in designs and testing as early as possible is always better as with any other portion of the chip design process. It improves efficiency and minimizes cost.

“Catch the security problem earlier and it’s going to cost you 10 times less” Tehranipoor said. “Go left. Don’t do it post-silicon if you can do it at layout level. Don’t do it at the layout level if you can do it at gate level. Don’t do it at gate level if you can do it at the RTL level.”

Performing security validation pre-silicon allows for far faster remediation of any issues that may come up and is increasingly becoming an expected part of the process. “At some point having a simulation-driven pre-silicon security signoff process will become table stakes for makers of security chips” said Riscure’s Bron. “Put differently I can see this becoming a competitive disadvantage for those companies that don’t.”

Lang Lin Ansys principal product manager noted that testing virtually has other benefits as well. “In simulation you don’t have the noisy environment faced by the post-silicon chip” he said. “You’re living in a digital world a virtual world so you can clearly see where the leakage path is from simulation which might not be that clear in silicon.”

However it’s crucial to keep in mind that from a security point of view a design and its implementation are two very different things. “A cryptographic algorithm can be secure on paper (the ‘design’) yet the implementation of it can give rise to side-channel leakage that renders the overall product insecure” Bron said. “What I like about the notion of pre-silicon security is that it allows developers to design security into their design design vulnerabilities out of their design and to see how this security carries over into the implementation of the design.”

Anticipating complex environments

Complexity always has been a big challenge for security experts and it becomes even more difficult to safeguard a chip if it’s being included in a heterogeneous design with multiple components that are not developed by the same company. That makes testing all the more important and how that testing is done can make a big difference.

Chips ideally should be tested in a worst-case scenario with all countermeasures disabled — “without redundancy without security measures and so on so the chip is operated in the worst condition for security and we see the pure hardware security features” said Peter Laackmann distinguished engineer for the Connected Secure Systems (CSS) Division at Infineon. “This means if you bring the chip into another environment then the situation should not get worse.”

Still complex environments can introduce vulnerabilities in other ways. For example consider a crypto wallet that’s breached despite the presence of a security chip because that security chip happens to be controlled by a standard microcontroller. “With electrical glitches on the standard microcontroller hardware wallets were successfully broken although they have security chips certified according to Common Criteria inside which were not harmed at all” Laackman said.

Robert Ruiz director of product marketing at Synopsys said utilizing PCIe or USB ports to test for defects can introduce vulnerabilities as well. “That technique itself kind of opens up the chip if not the whole system to hack because you’re basically giving hackers entry points into the system through a standard plug-in port… so these new techniques they’re improving efficiency on design and manufacturing yet they may actually open up the door a bit” he said.

Ongoing validation

Testing chips both on their own and as part of package is essential. “A die should always be tested in isolation first and chip makers are doing this” said Bron. “The testing of all components ‘together’ is what evaluation methods like Common Criteria tackle very well and we see chipmakers that understand these evaluation processes well enough to be able to derive benefit from this during chip design/package design.”

At the same time nothing done pre-silicon eliminates the need for validation after the fact. “You would not just build a vehicle without computing the needed functions and the needed safety and just testing it afterwards” Laackmann said. “So testing is always mandatory for hardware and for software and also in combination. But you can spare some time and make your results more reliable if you have pre-silicon tests in advance.”

Testing engineering samples or final commercial samples can offer significant benefits even if it’s too late to fix some potential issues. “Some security vulnerabilities that are discovered this way can be (partly) mitigated in firmware still” Bron said. “Others cannot and these are typically learning opportunities to make the next generation of chips more secure.”

Increasing demand for security

Interest in security is trending upward driven by customers with greater security concerns for everything from smart cards to automotive applications. “The priority is based on the application” Ansys’ Lin said. “For applications with secret data with confidential data of course security is prioritized higher than the other metrics.”

In the future it will be possible to test for specific security concerns that are most important for a specific application or user. “You’ll say ‘My application is this’ Tehranipoor said. “And the tool automatically will be intelligent enough to say ‘Okay got it – I’m going to choose x y and z I’m going to optimize it for you for that – and I’m going to give you a report based on that optimization.”

That kind of specificity is essential for security which can’t be pinned down to a straightforward universal metric. “And we’re going to get there” he said. “We’re not there yet. But we will get there.”

Chip Backdoors: Assessing The Threat

Steps are being taken to minimize problems but they will take years to implement.

Why It’s So Difficult — And Costly — To Secure Chips

Threats are growing and widening but what is considered sufficient can vary greatly by application or by user. Even then it may not be enough.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vc2VtaWVuZ2luZWVyaW5nLmNvbS9ldnMtcmFpc2UtZW5lcmd5LXBvd2VyLWFuZC10aGVybWFsLWljLWRlc2lnbi1jaGFsbGVuZ2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EVs Raise Energy Power And Thermal IC Design Challenges,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vc2VtaWVuZ2luZWVyaW5nLmNvbS9ldnMtcmFpc2UtZW5lcmd5LXBvd2VyLWFuZC10aGVybWFsLWljLWRlc2lnbi1jaGFsbGVuZ2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC7F31BD0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vc2VtaWVuZ2luZWVyaW5nLmNvbS9ldnMtcmFpc2UtZW5lcmd5LXBvd2VyLWFuZC10aGVybWFsLWljLWRlc2lnbi1jaGFsbGVuZ2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,,,,

TD was reached at 5290 m similar to the 5 to 6 km TD range for the wells in this basin and over 34 m of oil pay was recorded in the Campanian.

Baja is reported to be a down-dip lobe of the Krabdagu depositional system which was successfully drilled to the west in Block 58 by APA and TotalEnergies. APA have been working on Block 53 a number of years and drilled the Popokai 1 well (oil shows) in 2015. In 2017 the current operating group drilled the Kolibrie 1 well to the east of the block again with only oil shows in the Upper Cretaceous.

Most recently in April 2022 the operating group drilled the dry Rasper well in the north of the block in 2000 m water. With 34 m pay and a number of misses APA and partners will need to decide if this is a commercial extension of the Suriname Campanian play but for now the area remains part of a prolific petroleum basin.

Petronas and ExxonMobil are considering drilling options south of Baja in Block 52 with further opportunities to stretch the model. Block 58 remains the most successful block offshore Suriname and Total Energies and APA will continue to evaluate the commerciality of five discoveries there. The group is currently taking an extension to the exploration phase on that block where they also plan to appraise the Sapakara field. The Gerry de Souza rig will mobilise to Block 58 for the Awari 1 well located north of the original Maka Central discovery.

(WAFB) - An early morning fire at the Marathon Refinery in Garyville injured two workers a company spokesman said.

The fire reported around 12:30 a.m. on October 5 was put out by Marathon Petroleum crews Marathon spokesperson Melissa Ory said.

Ory said all employees and contract workers were accounted for. She said the two injured workers were receiving “medical attention” but did not elaborate on their injuries.

“Crews have deployed air monitoring in the community as a precaution and data indicates no off-site impact” the company said in an emailed statement. “We appreciate our trained first responders who have been actively managing this incident and our thoughts are with our two workers and their families” the statement said. “Our main priority remains ensuring the safety of our employees and contractors including first responders our neighbors and the surrounding community and to limit environmental impact.”

A fire at the same facility earlier this year in February left six workers with minor injuries the company reported at the time.

The Marathon Refinery in Garyville is located off Airline Highway between Baton Rouge and New Orleans in St. John Parish. The facility processes crude oils into gasoline asphalt propane sulfur and other products.

While the extent of McCormick’s ties to his “home state” are cloudy his ties to another state—the “deep state”—seem far more clear.

Despite his claims to the MAGA movement McCormick is steeped in the nexus of government intelligence and big business that Donald Trump and his acolytes ambiguously refer to as “the deep state.”

Those connections range from colleagues to boards to corporate investments with additional ties to notorious surveillance systems and an internal monitoring project at McCormick’s firm—the legendary hedge fund Bridgewater Associates—that was directly modeled after the Chinese Communist Party’s autocratic surveillance state.

And in the mind of Trump who is McCormick’s most crucial political ally some of those ties would be about as problematic as a MAGA Republican can get—such as for instance former FBI Director James Comey.

Comey it turns out accepted a senior role at Bridgewater the year after McCormick signed on as the fund’s president. As general counsel Comey oversaw an internal security program whose invasive and sometimes demeaning methods of surveillance and interrogation earned him a reputation as Bridgewater’s “in-house inquisitor.”

Aside from Comey the most prominent of McCormick’s “deep state” affiliations is his recent three-year run as a paid trustee of the secretive government-backed investment group In-Q-Tel—quite literally the Central Intelligence Agency’s very own venture capital firm.

McCormick’s role at In-Q-Tel appears on his candidate financial disclosures where he listed the entity’s name as “IQT.” Tax filings from In-Q-Tel which is registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit show that McCormick joined as a trustee in March 2018 and left in 2022 as he pursued his first Senate campaign. He collected an annual $35000 salary logging five hours of work a week according to the tax records and his election bid has since seen hundreds of thousands of dollars in support from executives tied to IQT and its investments.

For McCormick his deep state connections embody the larger political contradictions he’s already been forced to reconcile as a corporate Republican seeking office in the quasi-populist era of Trump.

That tortured balancing act failed two years ago. In the 2022 GOP primary in Pennsylvania the lifelong moderate failed to land Trump’s endorsement—losing that honor and subsequently the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz.

While McCormick got the coveted Trump endorsement this year—though there weren’t any other viable Republicans running in the primary—the dissonance is starker than ever.

Today the MAGA wing of the Republican Party finds itself fully enthralled with conspiracy theories about the intelligence community which Trump and his allies have for years cast as public enemy No. 1. Trump is vowing retribution as a key 2024 campaign plank.

Given that McCormick’s challenge to Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) will be one of the most contentious races of the 2024 cycle the hedge funder turned true MAGA believer may have to work harder than expected to scrub his deep establishment ties in order to appeal to his new base.

A former colleague of McCormick’s at Bridgewater told The Daily Beast that McCormick was “an honorable man” a “stand-up guy” and an “independent” and “brilliant leader.” But the colleague also put his finger on the Trump issue calling it a “sad reality” that McCormick will have to cave to the whims of the former president.

“He knows that if he wins he won’t get to do what he thinks is right” the person said. “He has his own money and he won’t be so susceptible to outside pressures financially. But he’s still going to have to kiss the ring and that’s unfortunate.”

McCormick’s campaign did not respond to detailed questions for this article.

It’s not clear if Trump knew about McCormick’s work with the U.S. intelligence community including the CIA and Comey. But as it turns out the deep state overlaps in myriad ways with McCormick’s 13-year tenure as a top executive at Bridgewater.

In 2010—the year after McCormick left George W. Bush’s Treasury Department to sign on as Bridgewater’s president—Bridgewater hired Comey who would later come to embody the darkest of Trump’s paranoiac accusations about federal agents.

Bridgewater brought Comey on officially as head of security and general counsel. In practice however Comey’s role more closely resembled that of an “in-house inquisitor” over the first iteration of the firm’s oppressive internal employee monitoring program which would later come to be called “The Politburo.”

Before he led the FBI unleashed a bombshell on Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign and got fired by Trump Comey reportedly raked in $7 million per year at Bridgewater. His task was to keep employees in line with the goals of what firm founder Ray Dalio called “radical transparency.” Those efforts included constant surveillance—including recorded meetings and videotaped internal “trials” of employees—with Dalio telling Bridgewater staff that Comey was “like a godfather adjudicating it all.”

The taped meetings were “just the tip of the surveillance ecosystem” at Bridgewater Vanity Fair reported in its profile of Comey’s time with the firm.

“A slew of ex FBI agents staffed the security team. Not only did cameras cover seemingly every inch of the property but they seemed to be watched in real time. Staffers who left their desks even briefly would return to sticky notes left on their computer monitors admonishing them for failing to put up a screen saver” Vanity Fair reported.

Comey would go through employee cellphone and computer records and was apparently so intrusive that he embarrassed one executive into resigning.

But when Comey’s security posse only turned up “little evidence of actual offending behavior to snuff out they created their own” according to Vanity Fair.

In one instance the report said Comey left an executive’s binder clearly labeled and unattended in Bridgewater offices. He then watched as surveillance cameras captured a low-ranking employee discovering the binder and going through it. Comey put the employee on trial and fired him with the approval of Dalio.

Comey however eventually found himself repelled by Dalio’s extremes resigning after two years. (This month Comey happens to be publishing a murder mystery novel that takes place inside a fictionalized version of Bridgewater.)

Dalio however only ramped things up implementing more and more intrusive policies to fully enact his “radical transparency” dogma.

That program it turns out was literally modeled on the Chinese Communist Party’s social surveillance program which Dalio openly admired. He even named the project after the CCP’s own “Politburo” and compared it favorably to “Big Brother” in a 60 Minutes interview.

China of course is another area where McCormick is against the prevailing GOP winds as Bridgewater’s internal culture “reflects aspects of Chinese political ideology” and invested heavily in the region—after McCormick took over as co-CEO in 2017 the fund’s Chinese investments skyrocketed.

The “Politburo” staffed up with officials from the National Security Agency and the CIA. But Bridgewater workers found it “intimidating” and “humiliating” and so intrusive that in 2017 one whistleblower filed a human rights complaint with the state of Connecticut where the fund is headquartered which was covered at the time in The New York Times.

As detailed in a recent book about Dalio titled The Fund the Politburo essentially pitted its employees against each other assigning roles like “auditors” and “overseers” and recording practically every moment of activity—all in pursuit of Dalio’s core “radical transparency” philosophy.

While the system repelled many employees—including Comey and one-time CEO Jon Rubinstein who both left after disagreements with Dalio—McCormick stayed aboard got a promotion and publicly defended Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Rubinstein quit after a “firing squad” meeting that McCormick personally sat in on according to the book where Rubinstein made the case that Dalio’s increasingly authoritarian policies were creating a “climate of fear.” When McCormick one of a handful of senior executives in the room was personally asked if he agreed with Rubinstein’s take he said he did not according to the book.

McCormick has subsequently defended Dalio. In 2020 when McCormick was asked if he took issue with a fundamental contradiction at the core of the monitoring program—“radical transparency” within the company but kept secret from outside scrutiny—he replied that he “doesn’t think it’s inconsistent at all.”

“Ray has always said this: Radical transparency is not total transparency. There are certain things that we’re not transparent about and consciously so. Personnel and salary discussions for example” McCormick said.

Shortly after rising to co-CEO McCormick joined the board at IQT.

The venture capital nonprofit which former CIA Director George Tenet founded in 1999 has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds to hundreds of technology firms and startups some of which are still secret.

Today IQT oversees more than $1 billion in assets and even has its own special-purpose acquisition company. Though the group keeps a low profile IQT maintains a close relationship with government intelligence and security divisions and runs “almost all investment decisions” by the CIA.

Many IQT investments seek to cultivate the private development of surveillance technology that could one day benefit the intelligence community and some of them overlap with both Bridgewater and McCormick.

One of those companies is Palantir a tech firm closely tied to right-wing financier Peter Thiel whose sprawling government work has made it a lightning rod for civil rights controversy—and whose fate was “rescued” by IQT’s investment.

Bridgewater itself helped fund Palantir and incorporated Palantir technology to advance its own investments as well as to help monitor Bridgewater employees in the fund’s pursuit of Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Palantir executives have contributed thousands of dollars to McCormick’s 2024 campaign.

Additionally one of IQT’s current trustees Howard Fox who also served on the board with McCormick has put serious money—more than $150000—behind McCormick’s candidacy in both 2022 and this cycle.

The same is true of other McCormick supporters like the CEO of Tenable an IQT-backed tech firm which announced its public stock offering shortly after McCormick joined the board.

And while it’s true that McCormick brings his own money to the table that hasn’t stopped Bridgewater donors from chipping in. In all Bridgewater employees mostly executives have contributed about $100000 to McCormick’s political aspirations with current president Kyle Delaney throwing $50000 to a 2022 super PAC backing his old colleague.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scoop: McCormick PAC launches big ad buy in Pennsylvania Senate race,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC86C72B0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcmdhbmZoLm5ldC9vYml0dWFyeS9qb3NoLW1jY29ybWlja9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary | Josh McCormick of Huntington West Virginia,"LEWISBURG WV - Joshua Howard McCormick 38 of Huntington WV formerly of Lewisburg WV passed away May 3 2024 at home.

Bob Casey goes after Dave McCormick on Connecticut residency,"PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — The race between Sen. Bob Casey and his Republican challenger former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick is expected to be one of the most hotly contested elections in the nation.

Casey's name is synonymous with Pennsylvania especially Scranton. But it didn't take Casey long to label McCormick a Connecticut Yankee for living outside the state for many years.

""He hasn't told the truth about where he lives"" Casey said. ""He lives in Connecticut. He hasn't been truthful about that. So you have an out-of-state candidate who's being supported by out-of-state billionaires.""

KDKA-TV's Jon Delano: ""Where do you live?""

McCormick: ""I live in Pennsylvania. I live in Pittsburgh.""

Just before his run for U.S. Senate in 2022 McCormick who is divorced and remarried sold his home in Connecticut bought a home in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill and rented another home in Connecticut.

""My youngest daughter lives with her mother in Connecticut so I periodically go back to Connecticut to see my daughter. Being a good dad is even more important than being a good senator"" McCormick said.

McCormick grew up in Bloomsburg where his father was president of Bloomsburg University. But he also lived outside the state working first for the Bush administration and then as president and CEO of Bridgewater Associates a Connecticut-based multi-billion dollar hedge fund from 2009 to 2022.

McCormick sees the Connecticut residency issue as a distraction from Casey's record.

""When you have the results that Bob Casey has with inflation border crime the war on oil and gas the world falling apart what do you do? Well you try to make it about something that is unrelated in your opponent"" McCormick said.

But Casey says McCormick's long out-of-state residency coupled with his work for a hedge fund associated with multi-millionaires demonstrates who he will represent in the Senate.

""He hadn't voted in Pennsylvania in about 16 years. So I think that's going to be an issue. But I think ultimately it's going to be about whose side you are on"" Casey said.

Casey sees himself as representing hard-working middle-class Pennsylvanians while McCormick argues that Casey has failed to deliver any results.

McCormick criticizes Casey for supporting President Biden's infrastructure bill CHIPS and Science Act the Inflation Reduction Act and other bills.

""Bob Casey has been a 98% vote for Joe Biden"" McCormick said.

Casey sees himself as a soft-spoken doer who gets things done for this part of Pennsylvania.

""The bridge investment alone is about a quarter of a billion dollars just for bridges"" Casey said. ""But there's investments for K-12 education investments for communities all across the board whether it was in the infrastructure bill the American Rescue legislation or otherwise. So we've been able to get resources to communities to try to lift them up but we still have work to do so I want to keep delivering.""

The two candidates disagree on other issues as well like abortion. Casey who is personally pro-life supports the Women's Health Protection Act to codify abortion rights nationwide while McCormick opposes abortion with limited exceptions and opposes all federal legislation on the subject.

""Our states should decide"" McCormick said. ""Pennsylvania should decide as it has. My belief is that we shouldn't have bans. We shouldn't have national legislation.""

Casey says McCormick's work at the hedge fund to promote China will be another issue.

""When China cheats Pennsylvania loses jobs. So he's helped to fuel that rise of China and I think that's going to be a major issue in the campaign"" Casey said.

Delano: ""So you're suggesting he's soft on China?""

Casey: ""I don't think there's any question about it compared to what I've been doing.""

""I've been in business"" McCormick said. ""Yes my business did 2% of its business in China. I know what it's like to negotiate against the Chinese in the government and in business. There is no one better equipped to deal with the challenge of China than me.""

These are just a few of many issues on which Casey and McCormick disagree. Given the millions both campaigns will spend expect to hear a lot more in the months ahead."

However it turns out it’s backfiring spectacularly on actual McDonald’s staff who are reporting the hyper-popular promotion has brought about chaos and misery as they struggle to fulfill an avalanche of orders. “bro pls don’t order those adult McDonald’s happy meals bro I’m begging” wrote one employee on TikTok.

2021's Pokémon card promotion was thought by many to be the nadir of customer invasions for the poorly-paid staff of the world’s largest fast food chain. However this month’s Happy Meals For Adults endeavor is proving many degrees worse according to employees we spoke to along with those posting to Reddit and social media.

Under the title “New Adult Happy-meals are killing me” one anonymous worker posted to Reddit to say “We literally just came off the ‘buy one get one for a dollar’ and we were swamped with Big Mac meals. Now with this we have to literally stockpile them to survive a rush. I hate it.”

It seems that the offer of a cheap burger combined with what will inevitably become a collectible toy has driven customers into a frenzy with orders coming in faster than restaurants can serve them. “The most difficult aspect of this promo for the crew is the sheer volume of these meals that we are selling” one worker told Kotaku via Reddit DMs. “Most stores I have seen have sold out of either the special boxes Big Mac buns or toys. Some places it’s more than one of these.”

Customer’s Adult Happy Meal Orders Can Be Out of Control

The issue appears to be that in order to buy one of the adult Happy Meals customers need to pick up a Big Mac or a box of 10 chicken nuggets—significantly bigger and more complex orders than go into a traditional child’s Happy Meal box. That and children only get a Happy Meal when they’ve successfully nagged an adult into buying them one. Adults can just buy stuff whenever they like. And they are. In crazy numbers. And it doesn’t help that apparently the boxes haven’t even been designed to stack something that puts additional strain on the staff who have to juggle the endless orders.

Adult Happy Meal Demand Strains McDonald's Workers Adult Happy Meal Demand Strains McDonald’s Workers

Many workers are taking to Reddit to post pictures of extraordinary orders coming through either via the app or in drive thrus. This monster order from a drive thru for instance involved eight Big Macs and 20 chicken nuggets along with ten portions of fries ten drinks etc and all of them in adult Happy Meal boxes. With a 50% off coupon. For just one customer in the long line and according to what we’ve seen this is non-stop. One staffer reported their manager called back an order for 43 fries at once.

I asked an employee how this compared to a normal day. “I would say at least twice or three times as many Big Macs and not too many more nuggets.” This of course then has knock-on effects to everyone in the store whether working the registers or trying to keep up with the orders in the kitchens.

McDonald’s Workers Are Sharing the Chaos on TikTok

Some are posting footage to TikTok showing extraordinary numbers of Happy Meal orders on the line. Another TikTok video simply has a McD’s staffer begging people not to order the adult Happy Meal.

It’s hard to really express just how popular this offer is proving to be. But perhaps knowing that videos of people posting about having simply bought one on Tiktok are regularly getting hundreds of thousands of views sometimes millions gives an idea.

Another McDonald’s employee I spoke to told me they sold out of the Cactus Plant Flea Market box for the meals the first day. They added while acknowledging that taking drive thru orders and making drinks wasn’t too bad “I can see the stress among my coworkers.”

This is all exacerbated of course by customers’ ability to use delivery apps to order meals to their homes now made dramatically more popular during the pandemic and allowing people to make vast orders without fear of having to carry them. That and the “chaos” caused by McDonald’s own app: when people can tap their hyper specific orders without having to leave their house and are sometimes offered a discount for it they feel more comfortable asking for absurd meals that have endless customizations.

In slightly better news when I asked one of the McDonald’s employees if their bosses were being understanding they were emphatic in their response. “While I cannot vouch for any stores but my own they are under an equal amount of stress as me and the rest of the crew. And they have been very understanding of the situation.”

But while potential customers were excited about the special promotion—and the limited edition toys—McDonald’s employees were less enthusiastic about dealing with a rush of customers. “I can see the stress among my coworkers” one employee told Kotaku.

Employees are venting on social media like TikTok and Reddit. “Y’all please stop ordering these” posted one employee on TikTok. Another employee wrote “They going crazy with the adult Happy Meals” over a video showing the number of Happy Meal orders.

“New Adult Happy meals are killing me” said one post on the McDonald’s employees subreddit.

“We ran out of boxes the first day we had them ran out of toys the second and on the third day we had to say the truck doesn’t come till tomorrow” wrote one commenter elsewhere on the subreddit. “It’s been…not fun.”

“Leading up to the launch we prepped crew with training and resources in anticipation of higher traffic in restaurants” a McDonald’s USA spokesperson told Fortune continuing to say that “our restaurant crew members are the best in the business and we appreciate everything they’re doing to serve customers during this limited-time promotion.”

This isn’t the first time a McDonald’s promotion has caused hassle for the staff.

In 2017 McDonald’s revived its Szechuan dipping sauce for one day as part of a marketing exercise with Adult Swim show Rick and Morty. Desperate fans swarmed restaurants hoping to get some of the limited supply leading to long lines disruptive customers and even calls to law enforcement. The chaos was worsened by poor communication from McDonald’s as to which restaurants were taking part in the promotion meaning customers flocked to sauce-less restaurants.

Customer chaos happened again in 2021 when McDonald’s revived its Pokémon Happy Meals complete with collectible cards to celebrate the video game franchise’s 25th anniversary. Unfortunately the promotion occurred during a bubble in Pokémon trading cards in which cards could be flipped for a 350-times return.

Some restaurants were forced to restrict sales of the Pokémon Happy meals to stop scalpers from buying up all the available Happy Meals and flipping the included trading cards on eBay.

It’s not just McDonald’s. Last year a tweet from a purported Starbucks employee went viral after the worker complained about customers adding too many modifiers to their drinks leading to many other baristas complaining about the stress of completing similarly complex orders.

Below is the yearly chart for MCK.When I examine price action over a long time period I always log adjust my chart. Below is the log-adjusted chart.Upon seeing this chart I immediately knew what was going on: the stock price jumped S-curves. I will try to illustrate below how I reached this conclusion.To begin I drew Fibonacci levels from the last reaction low to the last reaction high on the yearly timeframe.The previous reaction low was the bottom of 2008 because that bottom was a Fibonacci retracement of some earlier reaction high the reaction high is the top in 2015 because price did not surpass that high without first undergoing a Fibonacci retracement (to the golden ratio).As you can see above from 2015 to 2018 the price retraced down to the golden ratio (0.618) on the yearly chart. It is often from this retracement level that the base of the second S-curve is created. (For simplicity I only included the 0.618 Fibonacci level on the chart).Some may say that this pattern is merely a bull flag or pennant. (See chart below)Indeed bull flags and pennants can be another way to visualize S-curve jumps.Whereas on a deeper more mathematical level S-curve jumps are logarithmic spirals (approximated as Fibonacci spirals or Golden spirals). If you wish to delve deeper into logarithmic spirals including the Golden spiral you can check out this Wikipedia page: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_spiral These Fibonacci or Golden spirals are present on mostly every chart and they appear on mostly every timeframe (hence they are).One of the best charts you can use to visualize these spirals is the chart of Bitcoin. Below are charts of Bitcoin which attempt to show the endless fractal nature of Fibonacci spirals (or ""S-curve jumps"").I've only illustrated a few of the spirals but indeed there are numerous spirals. (I tried to do my best using the tools on Trading View to draw these spirals but it can be quite hard to manipulate the curves perfectly to price action.)One may ask what about when price falls? That is obviously not an S-curve jump since the price is falling.Actually when price is crashing it is usually just an S-curve jump or Fibonacci spiral on the inverted chart.Although I have not tested it with scientific rigor I do hypothesize that Bitcoin's price movement is a series of infinitely fractal and competing Fibonacci spirals on various timeframes including Fibonacci spirals on inverted scales. Price movement can be thought of as an infinite series of S-curve dilemmas where infinitely fractal S-curves including those of which are inverse S-curves compete to govern the next price move.Each dilemma is resolved when an S-curve reaches its inflection point such that it governs price movement and price moves rapidly in that direction until it approaches capacity and faces its next dilemma.Those who know Calculus may recognize this chart. Indeed this is the graph of a logistic function. The mathematical terminology for an ""S-curve"" isHere are some more interesting charts of S-curves (none of which is intended to be investment advice)Meridian Bioscience (VIVO) jumps S-curves on its yearly chartThe U.S. Dollar Index jumps S-curves on its yearly chartThe entire price action of Chinese EV Company (NIO) is an S-curve that just completed a perfect golden ratio retracementJapan's faces a population S-curve dilemmaCitigroup underwent S-curve growth up until the Great Recession.Then it crashed or underwent S-curve growth on the inverted chart.In summary price movement involves an endless series of S-curves or Fibonacci spirals. Identifying an S-curve on a high time frame before it reaches its inflection point and breaks out can lead to tremendous gains (among the most lucrative gains one can realistically make in the financial markets).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjItbWlkdGVybS1lbGVjdGlvbnMtaGVhbHRoLW9oaW8tbmF0aXZlLWFtZXJpY2Fucy1jYW1wYWlnbnMtYmYzYTBhMWE4MzQxOTMwMzM5ZTYxNGVlNjQ1MThlMWLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Drug companies in opioid crisis donated $27K to Ohio's Ryan,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='apnews.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /article/2022-midterm-elections-health-ohio-native-americans-campaigns-bf3a0a1a8341930339e614ee64518e1b (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC8981870>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjItbWlkdGVybS1lbGVjdGlvbnMtaGVhbHRoLW9oaW8tbmF0aXZlLWFtZXJpY2Fucy1jYW1wYWlnbnMtYmYzYTBhMWE4MzQxOTMwMzM5ZTYxNGVlNjQ1MThlMWLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,

Maiko is the first bonobo in the world to receive an implantable heart monitor

The Columbus Zoo and Aquarium in Ohio recently implanted six great apes with Medtronic Reveal LINQ™ insertable cardiac monitors (ICMs) to help identify and track heart problems in the animals.

“The hearts of great apes are very similar to human hearts” said Dr. Ilana Kutinsky a cardiologist and electrophysiologist who participated in the implants. “Great apes die from heart disease just like people do.”

Heart disease is the leading cause of death among apes living in zoos. The Columbus Zoo in conjunction with the Great Ape Heart Project based in Detroit implanted the monitors in two gorillas two orangutans and for the first time in the world two bonobos.

Bonobos share more than 98% of the same DNA as humans. All six apes implanted with Reveal LINQ are experiencing symptoms of heart disease.

Medtronic’s Tim Laske shares readings from one of the implanted devices.

“These devices will provide the ability to monitor the apes in real time and adjust medications as needed to make sure we’re providing the best care to these animals through all their years” said Dr. Priya Bapodra-Villaverde Columbus Zoo senior veterinarian. “Not only are these procedures a breakthrough for these six individual great apes but the cardiac monitors will also provide critical knowledge to advance veterinary care for their species.”

Reveal LINQ is about one third the size of a AAA battery. Implanted under the skin it can monitor a patient’s heart 24 hours a day seven days a week for several years. The system records heart activity and sends data to the patient’s doctor – or veterinarian – alerting them to any detected abnormal heart rhythms.

All six of the great apes implanted with heart monitors suffer from heart disease just like humans.

“The data we collect will be included in the world’s largest data base of cardiac health-related data in great apes” said Dr. Marietta Danforth of the Great Ape Heart Project. “This information is on gorillas orangutans bonobos and chimpanzees worldwide amongst zoos and allows us to look at trends over time.”

Medtronic is a long-time partner of the Great Ape Project and donated 40 ICMs to the effort. Similar procedures will take place at several more U.S. zoos in the coming months.

In addition to great apes Reveal LINQ devices are helping monitor the hearts of gray and maned wolves mountain lions oryx Svalbard reindeer mule deer jaguars and bears (“How healthcare technology is changing wildlife conservation.”).

Sulongo an orangutan also received a heart monitor

In total Medtronic has supported research in 20 different species to date with additional species planned in 2023.

“Our Mission to alleviate pain restore health and extend life goes beyond creating medical devices to improve human life” said Tim Laske vice president of research in the Medtronic Cardiac Ablation Solutions Operating Unit. “Another part of our Mission is also to be good global citizens. This guides us towards helping take care of the planet and the species in it. We’re proud to be part of this effort.”

The contract comes through a partnership with a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB). Medtronic will install 115 GI Genius intelligent endoscopy modules across numerous VA medical facilities in the U.S.

Veterans can now access Medtronic’s artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The company designed it to improve the accuracy of polyp detection in colonoscopy screening. According to a news release the Veteran’s Health Administration performs approximately 250000 colonoscopies yearly.

“We’re proud to give back to the men and women who have served our country by extending this powerful and proven tool in the fight against colorectal cancer” said Geoff Martha Medtronic chair and CEO. “This contract by the VA underpins the critical role technology can play in the lives of patients and furthers Medtronic’s ongoing commitment to providing VA patients and physicians with innovative healthcare solutions.”

About the GI Genius endoscopy module

The GI Genius module received FDA authorization in April 2021. Medtronic said it’s the first-to-market computer-aided polyp detection system using AI to detect colorectal polyps in real time. The AI helps physicians diagnose and prevent colorectal cancer. GI Genius serves as “a second set of eyes” for administering physicians Medtronic says. As a result it provides a 50% reduction in missed colorectal polyps compared to standard colonoscopy.

Medtronic said the system is currently installed at the Richmond McGuire VA Medical Center. It represents the first hospital to incorporate AI into colorectal cancer screenings for veterans. The VA National Gastroenterology and Hepatology Program Office determines installations awarded through the new contract.

“As one of the five most frequently diagnosed cancers among VA patients the GI Genius module is a cutting-edge AI-assisted technology that can help physicians locate more polyps than with standard colonoscopy alone” said Giovanni Di Napoli president of the Medtronic Gastrointestinal Business. “We are proud to be supporting the Department of Veterans Affairs by partnering with SDVOSB companies to deliver this cutting-edge technology to thousands of veterans who have honorably served our nation.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5tZWR0cm9uaWMuY29tL05FV1NST09NLUhvdy1NZWR0cm9uaWMtc3VwcGx5LWNoYWluLXRlYW1zLWFyZS1yZWR1Y2luZy0yNS10b25zLW9mLXBhY2thZ2luZy13YXN0ZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Medtronic supply chain teams are reducing 25 tons of packaging waste,"Bradley Watson a field services and operational excellence manager in Cardiac Rhythm Management is used to receiving customer feedback. But when a physician in Australia asked Watson if there was a way to reduce packaging waste for a line of our pacemakers he got to work connecting with the right people.

This feedback galvanized our Global Operations and Supply Chain team to launch a pilot program to reduce waste from Attesta™ Azure™ and Astra™ pacemaker packages. The team recently completed the pilot with outstanding results: The project will save five tons of plastic and 20 tons of paper from the landfill over the next year based on production forecasts for these devices.

Reducing waste increasing supply chain flexibility

Device instructions help customers and are required by regulatory agencies — but they can also contribute to waste. The pacemaker packages previously included a multi-language CD and multiple sets of paper instructions with relevant languages for each country they might be shipped to.

Based on findings from the pilot project Global Operations and Supply Chain moved most instructions online. If a device goes to a country that requires paper instructions our local distribution centers now add only a single set of paper instructions.

This approach is called last-mile customization: Devices remain in a standard format for as long as possible and are customized when there is demand.

“We can be more flexible to make sure we’re supporting customers no matter where they are in the world and what regulatory requirements are in place” said Guillaume Mestrallet business process improvement manager who led the project’s implementation. “And we’re also doing the right thing for the environment by removing waste from our processes.”

The project’s success required global coordination. Teams verified whether 200 countries would accept online instructions. Paper instructions were moved from manufacturing sites to distribution centers which must meet regulatory requirements for packaging and labeling. And all changes were implemented according to our internal quality system including design and production controls.

This experience may serve as a guide for other product lines. And it sets a foundation for digital transformation activities in Global Operations and Supply Chain.

“I’m excited for the future. For us to be a digital business we need to learn how to separate some of these final manufacturing configurations” said Sheila Minske engineering capital director who developed the project’s strategy. “This project is a big step in learning how to do that today before we need to have it all in place for tomorrow.”

And for children living with this condition their caretakers must think about all of these things and learn their insulin needs for them.

Now layer on top of this the expense of living with this autoimmune disease. The diabetes research foundation JDRF estimates adults with Type 1 diabetes spend about $20000 a year managing their condition.

Fortunately the number and quality of options for diabetics has increased dramatically. Today’s diabetics can lead healthier fuller lives thanks to new user-friendly affordable and discrete devices that have been developed to assist them with daily self-care routines and needs.

The reasoning behind the advances in delivery and monitoring equipment can be distilled into two words: improving compliance. As the number of people diagnosed with diabetes has risen each year compliance has headed in the opposite direction. Diabetics describe the older methods as being cumbersome painful complicated and unreliable at times.

Hearing this manufacturers have been delving into how they can remediate these issues. The answer they discovered is technology. The result has been the introduction of cutting-edge tech such as closed loop systems smaller and more accurate continuous glucose monitors smart devices and faster-acting insulins. What’s more during the next few years as costs come down and nano technology enables the hardware to be miniaturized more advancements are expected."

The stadium with a capacity of over 50000 seats will hold students alumni staff and family as they cheer on their college’s team for the “biggest little game in the nation.”

Ben Carlton ’20 said he went to every home football game for three years at the college to cover the team for the radio with WICB sports. Carlton gave half-time coverage as a first-year student and a sophomore and provided play–by–play for the station his junior and senior year.

Carlton said he attended the Cortaca Jug game at MetLife Stadium in 2019. The 2019 Cortaca Jug set the record for crowd size at a Division III football game with an attendance of 45161.



“We were all kind of blown away when they told us they’re going to be at MetLife” Carlton said. “Setting the [Division] III attendance record was really exciting for everybody. I thought it was a blast getting to work; it was really a privilege as well.”

While Carlton said he finds the Yankee Stadium venue to be exciting he has some concerns about the college hosting at a big name neutral venue again.

“Honestly I thought the neutral site venue was a one-off type of deal” Carlton said. “I know there was a lot of discussion over cutting faculty and then still paying God knows how much money to have this game at Yankee Stadium this year but it’s a big chance for it to be put on a much bigger stage than they could from just doing it on campus.”

Senior Nick Lubrano is the WICB and VIC radio sports director at the college producing all football broadcasts on the station. Lubrano has been at all of the Bomber football home games this season and said he is looking forward to the Cortaca Jug game this year.

“I personally am very excited for Cortaca to be hosted at Yankee Stadium for the fact that I think it’s going to give our student media a lot of exposure into a really professional environment” Lubrano said.

Some students said that they wish the college kept the game at Butterfield Stadium despite the fanfare that came with the game at Metlife Stadium. Cortaca switches between SUNY Cortland and Ithaca College each year in terms of who hosts the game however Ithaca College has opted to move the game off-site during its last two hosting years.

“I think it would have been nice for the student body at least the seniors to get a home Cortaca game at some point just to see what the atmosphere would have been like” Lubrano said.

Carlton however attended the Cortaca Jug game hosted on Ithaca College’s campus when he was a sophomore back in 2017.

“The place was packed out standing room only everyone’s standing shoulder to shoulder” Carlton said. “It was super exciting … for it to be [here] and have that extra buzz on campus.”

Senior Sam Hefti said she has never been to a Cortaca Jug game. However she feels as though the aspect of traveling so far away to the neutral venue for the game takes away chances for students to attend the game.

The college will provide buses from the Athletics and Events Center lot to Yankee Stadium the day of the game. While in 2019 the buses to MetLife did not have a cost to ride the buses this year will cost $20 round trip to both Yankee Stadium and back to campus.

“The fact that it costs $20 on top of the normal ticket prices if you don’t have your own form of transportation is also not great” Hefti said. “It’s kind of creating a barrier for students that really want to go to the game and maybe they can only afford a ticket.”

Hefti said that traveling so far from campus to watch the game can add stress to any attendees as the drive to the Bronx from Ithaca takes several hours. She commented that it can be difficult for students who may take part in extracurriculars or have multiple assignments to do on weekends to dedicate so much time to getting to the venue.

“I just wish it was at a location that’s a bit easier to get to if you’re going to host off site” Hefti said.

Junior Olivia Celenza said she feels that Cortaca being hosted at popular venues like MetLife Stadium and Yankee Stadium is an inappropriate use of the college’s funds.

“To be quite honest I feel like it’s an unnecessary expense” Celenza said. “Ithaca’s always talking about how we don’t have money how the school’s in a lot of financial distress and yet we are able to go to a big stadium … and put on a third division football game.”

However Susan Bassett associate vice president and director of Intercollegiate Athletics said in an email that the college is not paying anything to have the contest at Yankee Stadium contrary to what some students believe.

“The only expense we have is as a normal host of a home football game which includes the cost of the officials” Bassett said via email. “Everything else is fully covered. We also have the potential to get an additional stipend if the game is a sell-out … The College has budgeted for a normal hosting of Cortaca at IC. Those funds are supplementing the cost of the buses for spectators and performers.

Junior Molly Hankinson said she does not have any particular interest in football but plans to attend the Cortaca Jug game with her friends. Hankinson said she is excited about the spectacle of the event.

“It will be something cool to tell our kids” Hankinson said. “Especially for the athletes there [and] I think it’ll be cool for the cheerleaders.”

The exclusive window for campus ticket sales concluded Sept. 18 at noon. The remaining tickets have been made available to the general public.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC8wNi9zcG9ydC9qb2UtYnVycm93LWNvbmN1c3Npb24tbmZsLXR1YS10YWdvdmFpbG9hLXNwdC1pbnRsL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAVpodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIyLzEwLzA2L3Nwb3J0L2pvZS1idXJyb3ctY29uY3Vzc2lvbi1uZmwtdHVhLXRhZ292YWlsb2Etc3B0LWludGw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cincinnati Bengals' quarterback Joe Burrow says head injuries are 'inherent' risk of playing in NFL,"CNN —

Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow said on Wednesday that head injuries are an “inherent” risk of playing in the NFL.

Appearing on “The Colin Cowherd” podcast Wednesday the 25-year-old said that while he’s likely suffered at least one concussion in his career he hasn’t had any “long-lasting” effects from head injuries.

Burrow admitted those hits to the head led him to forget the second half of a game or even the entire game.

“You can make all the rules you want to make the game as safe as you possibly can but there is an inherent risk and danger with the game of football” said Burrow when he was asked if those episodes of forgetting parts of or entire games had created anxiety for the Heisman Trophy winner.

“You have 300-pound men running 20 miles an hour trying to take your head off while standing still trying to ignore it and find receivers that are open … That’s part of the game I think. Part of what we signed up for.

“You’re going to have head injuries you’re going to tear your ACL you’re going to break your arm. That’s the game we play that’s the life we live and we get paid handsomely for it. So I think going into every game we know what we are getting ourselves into.”

‘Fencing response’



Burrow’s comments come just under a week after Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa was stretched off the field against the Bengals having suffered a head injury.

Video showed Tagovailoa’s forearms were flexed and his fingers contorted – a sign that CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta a neurosurgeon said is a “fencing response” and can be linked to a brain injury.

Tagovailoa was later diagnosed with a concussion. Four days earlier Tagovailoa appeared to suffer a head injury when his helmet hit the turf and he got up stumbling before being taken to the locker room for a concussion check.

The Dolphins initially announced Tagovailoa was questionable to return to the game with a head injury but he came back out onto the field in the third quarter and finished the game throwing for 186 yards and a touchdown.

Tagovailoa told reporters after the game that he fell onto his back before his head hit the turf causing his back to lock up and the resulting stumble. He added that he was evaluated for a concussion but was ultimately cleared.

The incident led to an investigation by the NFL and the NFL Players Association (NFLPA) into how Tagovailoa’s injuries was handled as well as a review of concussion protocols.

On Wednesday according to a source familiar with discussions between the two parties updates to the concussion protocol could come as early as Thursday.

“The urgency on getting it done before tomorrow is that we’ll have new protocols heading into Thursday night’s game and that way we can have the new protocols in place before they play tomorrow night” the source told CNN on Wednesday.

Current protocols prevent a player from returning to the field if they have any “gross motor instability” determined to be neurologically caused.

According to the source the new goal is for any gross motor instability to be cause for removal from the field. “It’s ‘if you see a player fall down and not be able to get up as a result of any injury they can’t return.’ That’s really the simplest way to describe it” the source said.

The source noted that attorneys for the league and the players association are in ongoing discussions including on the definition of gross motor instability."

and Billionaires Are Lining Up for the Chance to Operate a New York City Casino,"As the development of a New York City casino inches closer towards reality the race is on to secure a license.

New York state voters authorized the creation of seven casinos in 2013 and four upstate facilities opened in the first phase. Now the second phase is underway and licenses for three casinos in the New York City area will soon be open for bidding.

A casino in the U.S.’s most populated city will have access to a metropolitan area with 20 million residents in addition to the tens of millions of tourists visiting New York City annually. Operators who win one of the three licenses will be capturing gambling revenue which previously went to casinos located outside the New York area such as New Jersey’s Atlantic City and Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun in Connecticut.

The New York City area already has two gambling facilities known as racinos horse racetracks that also operate slot machines and other electronic games. The Malaysian-based casino developer Genting operates the Resorts World facility at the Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens while MGM Resorts controls the Empire City racino in Yonkers located in Westchester county. Barring any unforeseen actions these locations are most likely to receive two of the three casino licenses according to Gary Pretlow a member of the New York State Assembly and co-chair of the Committee on Racing and Gaming. And as pre-established facilities it won’t take long after being licensed for them to begin operating as casinos.

“It’s really the one license the other two are spoken for” said Alan Woinski CEO of Gaming USA Corporation gambling consulting firm. “It’s going to be a bloody battle.”

Gambling operators will need to select a partner with New York influence said Woinski preferably one with name recognition who will be embraced by the city. While many of the potential bidders have been generous donors to city officials or belong to beloved New York franchises license proposals from those with significant involvement in Republican causes could potentially see hurdles in winning over key decision-makers in the heavily Democratic city and state.

On Oct. 3 the State Gaming Commission announced members of the Gaming Facility Location Board who will now have 90 days to solicit proposals from casino developers interested in one of the three licenses. But before the board approves proposals applications must be accepted by two-thirds of local community advisory committees created to gauge local support for bids. These boards will have members appointed by Governor Kathy Hochul Mayor Eric Adams and the applicable borough president city council member state senator and assembly member.

“My best educated guess would be that bids are accepted by the end of the year and early next year there’s a declaration of who got the licenses” said State Senator Joseph Addabbo chair of the Senate Racing Gaming and Wagering Committee.

The new casinos will pay a minimum 25 percent tax on slots and at least 10 percent tax on gross gaming revenue said Pretlow. And license fees which are starting at a $500 million minimum could potentially get bid up to nearly $1 billion for the right to operate a casino in New York City he said.

With just one casino up for grabs here are the major players:

Wynn Resorts and Related Companies

Nevada-based Wynn Resorts and real estate developer Related teamed up in September to announce their intention to pursue a casino license for Hudson Yards on Manhattan’s far West Side in what was the first public announcement of an intended bid. Related founded by billionaire and Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross. Wynn founder of the Mirage and eponymous Wynn casinos has a long track record in Atlantic City Las Vegas and Macao but recently has been accused of lobbying on behalf of China by the Justice Department. Meanwhile Related’s CEO Jeff Blau who told Bloomberg the partnership was a “perfect pair” has donated at least $400000 to New York state office candidates since 2001 while Ross last November gave nearly $70000 to Hochul’s campaign.

Hard Rock

Casino operator Hard Rock owned by Florida’s Seminole tribe is reportedly interested in three potential casino locations in Manhattan. A recent email sent by a Hard Rock executive to his team referenced preparations “for the final stretch of our process for the third New York City casino license.” Donors associated with Hard Rock have given Hochul’s campaign more than $100000 so far in 2022.

Las Vegas Sands

Casino and resort company Las Vegas Sands founded by late Republican donor Sheldon Adelson is another contender according to Woinski who believes the remaining casino license will be the site of a “three-horse race” between operators Wynn Hard Rock and Sands which owns the Venetian casinos. “Las Vegas Sands has a track record in Las Vegas and Singapore of building integrated resorts that’s probably what New York is looking for” said Woinski.

Bally’s Casinos

Soo Kim Bally’s Chairman has publicly announced his interest in pursuing a New York license. However Woinski believes the operator will have its hands full with the implementation of a new facility in Chicago.

Steven Cohen

Steven Cohen owner of the New York Mets and former founder of the S.A.C. Capital hedge fund has expressed interest in developing a casino near Met stadium Citi Field in Queens. While Cohen has had talks with Las Vegas Sands Hard Rock is reportedly the front runner to partner with him. Cohen’s influence and name recognition could push him towards being a frontrunner according to Woinski. He also has close ties with Mayor Eric Adams having contributed $1.5 million to a political action committee created to support Adams’ 2021 mayoral campaign.

John Catsimatidis

Billionaire John Catsimatidis the CEO of Gristedes Foods and former Republican gubernatorial candidate has announced his desire to build a casino in Coney Island.

Thor Equities

Real estate developer Thor Equities is also interested in a facility on Coney Island the birthplace of company founder Joseph Sitt.

SL Green Realty

Marc Holliday CEO of Commercial real estate company SL Green is allegedly interested in partnering with Hard Rock for a Times Square casino located in an SL Green skyscraper. In an earnings call earlier this year Holliday said Times Square would likely be the most globally accepted area for a casino.

Vornado Realty Trust

Finally real estate developer Vornado is also eyeing Times Square with chairman Steven Roth — an economic advisor to Donald Trump during his 2016 campaign — interested in a location near Herald Square.

“The overall proposal will be more important than who the developer is” said Woinski who believes the third casino license will be granted to a proposal with significant financial backing the involvement of influential New York figures and the inclusion of an integrated resort alongside the casino. “The third license has to be the most magnificent” he said.

However Woinski still believes the remaining license is anyone’s game. “At least 50 percent of the time the winner is someone you just don’t expect.”"

Microchip’s potential investment comes amid an unprecedented domestic building boom among chipmakers with major new factories planned in Arizona Idaho Texas Ohio and New York. Manufacturers are rushing to capitalize on a leap in demand for computer chips during the pandemic and $280 billion in new federal incentives for semiconductor research and manufacturing.

Oregon has so far missed out on all that construction even though the Portland area has one of the densest concentrations of chip manufacturing in the nation. That’s largely because the region lacks the large plots of industrial land big chipmakers seek.

Microchip’s potential expansion wouldn’t be nearly as large as the “megafabs” that Intel Micron Samsung and others are building in other parts of the country. But it could be an important signal that Oregon remains in the game.

Conversely if Microchip chooses to build elsewhere it could raise fresh questions about Oregon’s viability as a destination for growing chipmakers.

“Due to the complex nature of this topic and the rules surrounding the review of this matter there is nothing we can say publicly right now” Sarah Cagann spokesperson for Gresham wrote in an email Wednesday.

Microchip declined comment and Oregon’s economic development agency did not respond to inquiries about the project.

It’s not clear just how big Microchip’s Gresham investment would be what factors are weighing on its decision or how close it is to making a call on where or when to proceed.

City records show Microchip’s existing 827000-square-foot factory and associated development occupies only half of its 140-acre Gresham property on Southeast Stark Street. The remaining land is undeveloped.

It’s not clear just what it would take to land Microchip. The Gresham factory is the Arizona-based company’s largest. But it also has factories in Colorado the Philippines Thailand Pennsylvania and Germany.

Some large chipmakers notably industry heavyweights Intel and Nvidia are struggling this year amid falling demand for PCs and a saturated data center market. But demand for Microchip’s products continues to soar with second-quarter sales up 25% over the same period last year.

Microchip makes chips that play an essential supporting role in operating industrial equipment cars planes communication networks medical tools and many other products. The company said production at its Gresham factory doubled in the pandemic’s first year as Microchip rushed to address a global chip shortage and employment has grown to 864 employees.

The Arizona company has continued expanding since then and said Wednesday it has 150 contractors working to install more than 160 new manufacturing tools inside the existing Gresham factory.

Microchip said it has added 250 employees in the past two years with plans to add 300 more over the next two years. It’s working with Portland Community College and Mt. Hood Community College to prepay tuition and other costs for part-time employees who are earning electronics degrees while working as Microchip technicians.

A task force of government and business leaders set out plans last summer to make Oregon more attractive to semiconductor manufacturing by increasing the inventory of industrial land expediting environmental reviews increasing public incentives and investing in workforce development.

The task force said in August that Oregon was courting three unnamed chipmakers for potential expansions with a combined value of $8 billion. It wasn’t immediately clear whether Microchip’s expansion was among the three under consideration at that time.

Gov. Kate Brown who co-chaired the task force is preparing a package of legislation she hopes lawmakers will consider on “Day One” of their next session early next year. In the interim she has set aside $1 million to ready existing industrial land for development and secured legislative funding to speed environmental permitting.

The governor has warned that Oregon is in a “50-state competition” for a share of the federal chips spending and must move quickly to land chip manufacturers that are making their site selection decisions over the next several weeks.

Oregon chip manufacturing jobs pay annual wages that can start around $60000 and entry-level jobs typically require no more than a two-year associate degree. Boosters say the industry represents a chance to make high-wage jobs available to a diverse population of Oregonians.

A panel of Oregon lawmakers met Tuesday with members of the Oregon Business Council which shepherded the chips task force to discuss the future of the state’s semiconductor industry.

“We see this as being a real opportunity to create generational wealth and an opportunity for equitable economic development that we might not see again” said the business council’s Andrew Desmond.

Rep. Janelle Bynum chair of the House’s economic development committee is leading efforts to build legislative support for luring more chipmaking to Oregon. She said lawmakers need to be persuaded to act on the rapid timetable the governor and chips task force have been pushing.

“There is an inherent skepticism any time you say ‘This needs to be done with urgency.’ Legislators are very meticulous and they want to get it right” Bynum said. She said her colleagues are asking for specifics about land availability whether chip investment could take place outside the Portland area racial impact of the development and the environmental implications of new projects.

Businesses often make decisions rapidly and Bynum said the state Legislature isn’t set up to move that fast. So she said her goal is for the state to empower local governments with the land incentives and other tools to work directly with expanding chip manufacturers.

“We need to put the right pieces in place so that cities and counties and industry can be nimble” Bynum said.

Microchip paid $184 million for the Gresham factory in 2002 acquiring it from Fujitsu Microelectronics several months after Fujitsu shut down its own operations there.

Update: This article has been updated with additional detail on Microchip’s Gresham operations.

Microchips play a big role in our daily lives.

“It just runs all the electronics in our life’ said neighbor Kate Himes.

Although most of the community may not know the specifics of what a microchip does they know they’re in phones tablets cars and more.

“What those little structures do is they remember things so it’s building a memory device” said Cornell Nanoscale Facility Director Chris Ober.

“This is where data lives in these kinds of chips and everything today is about data and growing insights from data” said Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra.

But how many microchips does the average person have in their home?

Some Central New Yorkers estimate that number is probably much higher than they even realize.

“My car my computer my phone I’d say there’s probably 3 or 4 for sure and probably other things I don’t know so maybe a dozen” said neighbor Kevin Abbott.

The number is certainly higher as the microchips hide in things you may not expect.

The chips can also be found in digital thermometers lightbulbs toasters microwaves washing machines and so much more.

“I can assure you I have thousands and possibly tens of thousands of microchips in all the little gizmos I have” said Ober.

The technology has become a major contributor to our daily lives.

“All the things that we built our life around would stop working. I’m old enough I can read paper maps I’d hate to have to go to that” said Ober.

Ober says as a society we have really gone all-in with digital technology and the products the Micron plant will produce are at the center of it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzdW5pb24uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2FydGljbGUvU2NodW1lci1hbm5vdW5uY2VzLU1pY3Jvbi1idWlsZGluZy1tYXNzaXZlLWNoaXAtMTc0ODU5MDQucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Albany's chance at national chip lab jumps with Micron's upstate plan,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.timesunion.com/business/article/Schumer-announnces-Micron-building-massive-chip-17485904.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzdW5pb24uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2FydGljbGUvU2NodW1lci1hbm5vdW5uY2VzLU1pY3Jvbi1idWlsZGluZy1tYXNzaXZlLWNoaXAtMTc0ODU5MDQucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhaXRod2lyZS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC8wNi90aGUtY2hpcC1naXJsLXdvbWFucy1taWNyb2NoaXAtaW1wbGFudC1pbi1oZXItaGFuZC1nb2VzLXZpcmFsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'The Chip Girl': Woman's Microchip Implant in Her Hand Goes Viral,"A woman from Las Vegas Nevada has garnered more than three million followers on social media for showing what she can do with a microchip implanted in the back of her hand.

Burgundy Waller has called her husband a “tech genius.” She had a chip implanted in her hand a little more than two years ago. It serves as a key to the couple’s mansion The Daily Mail reports. Her husband programmed the chip for her.

Listen to the latest episode of CBN’s Quick Start podcast 👇

Waller is known as “The Chip Girl” in her TikTok videos. She shares what the chip can do like unlocking doors drawers closets and other storage areas throughout their lavish home just by touching them.

The device uses radio frequency identification to respond to different objects.

https://youtu.be/ZnyAs2nzvfo

In one video Waller contends that getting chipped means “never having to carry or worry about losing her key.”

In another video she reveals her husband had an even more advanced chip implanted in his hand. His chip can store information including his social media accounts and websites.

She also explained how another version of the chip could store her credit card information which is something she says she wants.

“Not fair I have the old model” she joked in another video. “My hand is only a key guess it’s time for an upgrade.”

As CBN News reported in May implantable chips in humans are not new but for the last several years the push to market them to a dubious population has escalated.

A company in the United Kingdom has developed a new chip that allows you to pay on the same reader as a credit card. When a person with an implanted chip wants to pay for a product or service using a credit card reader they simply place their hand with the chip next to the card reader and the payment is made.

While some companies have implemented similar chip implants for internal company functions the British-Polish firm called Walletmor says that last year it became the first company to offer them for sale to the general population according to the BBC.

Even though a little more than half of 4000 people across the U.K. and the European Union told a survey last year they would consider having a chip implanted they also brought up privacy and security issues.

As CBN News has reported potential privacy concerns are already being raised about the ongoing development of such technology in implantable microchips that are being injected into the hands of thousands of willing participants across Europe.

“There is a dark side to the technology that has a potential for abuse” Nada Kakabadse professor of policy governance and ethics at Reading University’s Henley Business School told the BBC. “To those with no love of individual freedom it opens up seductive new vistas for control manipulation and oppression.”

“And who owns the data? Who has access to the data? And is it ethical to chip people like we do pets?” she asks.

The result she cautions could be “the disempowerment of many for the benefits of a few.”

Critics are sounding the alarm about ongoing developments in tracking technology for humans.

In addition an ingestible pill with such tracking technology was created and approved in 2017 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The pill which is intended to treat mental illness is called Abilify MyCite.

An edited viral video of Pfizer’s CEO Albert Bourla talking about the technology involved with the tracking pill came to light during the World Economic Forum in Davos Switzerland in 2018. In the video Bourla praises the development of the biological chip embedded inside the pill that when swallowed dissolves in your stomach sending a signal that the medication was taken.

Legitimate questions remain about the future use of this technology. For example could such a wireless pill be used one day by authorities to track other activities?

Individual Carbon Footprint Tracker

Social media users in May scorched Alibaba Group U.S.A. President J. Michael Evans after he told an audience at this year’s World Economic Forum that his company was developing technology for consumers to measure their whole carbon footprint. Alibaba Group USA is a subsidiary of Chinese internet giant Alibaba.

“What does that mean?” Evans asked. “Where they are traveling. How they are traveling. What are they eating. What they are consuming on the platform. So individual carbon footprint tracker” as a surprised reaction can be heard in the video coming from the audience.

“Stay tuned. We don’t have it operational yet. This is something that we are working on” Evans added.

There are clear implications beyond the function of simply being a “platform for consumers” to track their environmental impact. It’s another high-tech method for tracking human behavior and China is already widely known to be violating the human rights of its citizens with a social credit system of tracking. So the fact that the technology is coming from the Alibaba Group is raising alarms.

One Twitter user sounded an alarm about the idea saying “They are going to put a cap on the carbon you can consume per day and you will have to watch what you do to not go over it. They are going to force us to live like serfs.”

Conservative commentator J.D. Vance who’s running for a U.S. Senate seat in Ohio also tweeted “Imagine flying a private jet to a conference of the world’s most powerful people and then lecturing other people on their carbon footprint.”

Another user explained why so many people are concerned: “Because it isn’t about the carbon footprint at all.”

The Christian Perspective

Stories about people chipping their hands or authorities creating methods to track human behavior always spark biblical questions as well as privacy concerns.

As CBN News reported in February the Bible’s New Testament warns of the “Mark of the Beast” – a key sign of the End Times before Christ returns. But how can Christians recognize the mark when it becomes reality?

In a recent video on YouTube Evangelist Ray Comfort examines that question by looking at Revelation 13:16-17.

He causes all both small and great rich and poor free and slave to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name. — Rev. 13:16-17 (NKJV)

In the video Comfort the founder of Living Waters Publications and the ministry The Way of the Master explains the mark is not a vaccine or a virus.

“But the Scripture gives us the reason for the mark it is for commerce. Those who don’t have the mark will not be able to buy or sell” the Bellflower California-based preacher said.

Clearly that raises concerns about microchip implants that could one day be used to control people’s ability to buy and sell.

The Google team has developed a new AI model that can design complex chips in just hours. This is an incredibly difficult task and usually takes months for human engineers to accomplish. Let’s look into what this new artificial intelligence microchip is and the potential impact it could make in the technology industry.

How does a microchip work?

A microchip is a small electronic device that controls and stores electronic data. It is made up of a silicon chip that has been fabricated into a very small size. Silicon is a material found in nature and is very good at conducting electricity which makes it the perfect choice for microchips so they can quickly store and process information.

An AI chip is a microchip designed for artificial intelligence applications. They are specifically designed to handle the high computational demands of training and running deep neural networks.

What is the AI chip by Google and what does it do?

Google’s new AI chip is called the TPU (Tensor Processing Unit). It is specifically designed for machine learning tasks. The TPU can handle trillions of operations per second which is significantly faster than traditional CPUs and GPUs. It is also very energy efficient consuming low watts of power.

The tensor processing unit is designed to be used with Google’s TensorFlow software. TensorFlow is an open-source software library for machine learning. Google uses it to train its artificial intelligence models.

Possibly the most impressive thing about the Google chip is that Google claims that its chip can come up with complex chip designs in just hours whereas this process traditionally takes humans up to months to achieve.

Potential applications for the new AI chip

The potential implications of this new AI chip are huge. With the TPU artificial intelligence models can be trained much faster and more efficiently. This could lead to breakthroughs in various fields including medical research autonomous vehicles and weather forecasting.

Other potential applications for the chip include:

The factory is expected to create nearly 50000 jobs with the first phase investment of US$20 billion planned by the end of this decade.

The chip shortage has shone a spotlight on the state of semiconductor manufacturing in the US and how much of it has moved out of the country. The US government grew unhappy with how reliant the country’s economy and military have become on Asian high-tech manufacturing and ever since then industry leaders and politicians have been trying to reverse the US’ waning importance in the microprocessor business.

President Joe Biden after a lengthy back-and-forth signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law in August giving US semiconductor makers a US$52.7 billion push over five years to ramp up processor manufacturing. Ever since then the semiconductor market in the US has peaked in activity with many local and international chip players nearshoring their production in the US to cater to domestic demand.

The most recent of those nearshoring companies in the semiconductor space is Micron Technology a leading US-based memory chipmaker that unveiled its plans to invest up to US$100 billion over the next 20-plus years to build a computer chip factory complex in upstate New York. Micron said the project will result in the world’s largest semiconductor fabrication facility all in an effort to boost domestic manufacturing capabilities.

The move by Micron comes just two months after it announced its plans to invest US$40 billion through the end of the decade to build memory manufacturing in multiple phases in the US. The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 was put in place to encourage semiconductor companies to build and expand computer chip factories in the country.

“There is no doubt that without the CHIPS Act we would not be here today” said Micron’s chief executive Sanjay Mehrotra. The legislation and favorable tax treatment and partnerships with state governments like New York’s are key ingredients needed to match the subsidies offered by Asian nations and “bring chip-making back to America” Mehrotra added.

The giant factory will be built in Clay New York and Micron said site preparation would begin next year with construction throughout 2024 and production in volume after 2025. Over the next 20 years Micron said the project will generate nearly 50000 jobs — around 9000 Micron employees and more than 40000 jobs for suppliers contractors and others. What amount of federal monetary support that will flow to the project is still uncertain as companies cannot apply for that federal backing until next year since the CHIPS Act passed only a couple of months ago.

Other semiconductor nearshoring efforts besides Micron

Micron joins other major chipmakers in expanding operations in the US. Before the CHIPS legislation was passed Intel banking on investment incentives announced its plan to invest US$20 billion on two chip fabrication plants near Columbus Ohio back in January. The new “megafab” site could eventually house eight Intel fabs costing US$100 billion in total.

Then in August Intel and Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management agreed to jointly fund up to US$30 billion for chip factories in Arizona. Back in late 2021 Samsung had said it would build a US$17 billion plant in Texas. It later raised the possibility of adding several more in the state with a total long-term investment of nearly US$200 billion — higher than both Intel and Micron.

Even Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced in 2020 that it would construct a US$12 billion factory in Arizona. In an update in August this year Arizona’s State Governor Doug Ducey said the construction of the main chip facility was complete. The plant is expected to fabricate some of Apple’s A-series and M-series chips.

TSMC however has spoken about the hurdles of nearshoring in the US. Chairman Mark Liu told shareholders this year that the price tag for its Arizona plant was likely to go higher in part because the US lacked the rich ecosystem of suppliers and the large pool of skilled workers that had developed around TSMC (the world’s largest chip maker) in Taiwan.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzdW5pb24uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2FydGljbGUvU2NodW1lci1hbm5vdW5uY2VzLU1pY3Jvbi1idWlsZGluZy1tYXNzaXZlLWNoaXAtMTc0ODU5MDQucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Albany's chance at national chip lab jumps with Micron's upstate plan,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.timesunion.com/business/article/Schumer-announnces-Micron-building-massive-chip-17485904.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzdW5pb24uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2FydGljbGUvU2NodW1lci1hbm5vdW5uY2VzLU1pY3Jvbi1idWlsZGluZy1tYXNzaXZlLWNoaXAtMTc0ODU5MDQucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Which COVID-19 vaccine should they get?,"Page Content

​The short answer: Your child should get the COVID vaccine dose that is recommended for their age and health status.



The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) follows the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations to use the vaccine that is appropriate for the child's age on the day they get each shot or booster. There are many reasons for this. But the main reason is to have the dose that your child's immune system needs so it can learn to protect itself from the virus.

The first COVID vaccine doses that are recommended for people of all ages are called the primary series doses. They are the original COVID vaccines that were developed to protect against the original virus strain in the pandemic. An updated fall booster shot also called the omicron booster or ""bivalent"" vaccine is recommended for kids age 12 years and older. (Learn what booster doses kids need here.) Some children with certain medical conditions may need additional doses.

Which COVID shot should my child get if they had a birthday between doses?

The size of the dose a child gets is based on how old they are on the day that they get the COVID shot. However there are a few things to know about the COVID vaccine for kids who are crossing between age groups.

The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID vaccine and the Moderna COVID vaccine are the two products that are authorized for children age 6 months through 12 years old. Whether they got Pfizer or Moderna first kids should receive the product that is recommended for them on the day they are being vaccinated.

A child turning from age 4 years to 5 years between Pfizer primary series doses has two options:



Option 1

Pfizer primary series vaccine for age 6 months through 4 years for Dose 1 and





either Pfizer primary series vaccine for age 6 months through 4 years or Pfizer primary series vaccine for age 5 through 11 years for Dose 2 (depending on their age) and





Pfizer primary series vaccine for age 5 through 11 years for Dose 3 or



Option 2

2 doses of Pfizer vaccine for age 5 years through 11 years







A child turning from age 11 years to 12 years between Pfizer primary series doses can get:



Pfizer vaccine for age 5 years through 11 years for Dose 1

Pfizer vaccine for age 12 years and older for Dose 2

A child turning from age 5 years to 6 years between Moderna primary series doses can get:

Moderna vaccine for age 6 months through 5 years for Dose 1

Moderna vaccine for age 6 years through 11 years for Dose 2

A child turning from age 11 years to 12 years between Moderna primary series doses can get:

Moderna vaccine for age 6 years through 11 years for Dose 1

Moderna vaccine for age 12 years through 17 years for Dose 2

Why do we use age for the vaccine dose but weight for measuring a dose of medicine?

Vaccines don't work the same way medicines such as antibiotics do. Antibiotics help your body get rid of germs when you are sick. And to get rid of germs your body needs the right amount of medicine so it can make it to all parts of the body and find the problem. We dose antibiotics by weight so that the medicine can get to all the places of infection at levels needed by different size bodies.



A vaccine on the other hand helps your body know how to stop germs before they make you sick. Just a very small dose is all your cells need to learn how to stop germs. When the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines for babies and younger children were studied they were found to be safe and effective at the recommended doses. The lower doses are what have been authorized and recommended.

Cells in your immune system go to the spot where the vaccine is given rather than the vaccine needing to get all around the body. With information provided by the vaccine the immune cells then launch a response to get rid of the virus.

After a shot your child might have mild symptoms as the immune system practices what it learned and how to avoid getting sick. The next time your child is in contact with that virus the immune system will know how to stop your child from getting sick.

Does my baby or younger child need a COVID vaccine?

Yes! COVID vaccines are lifesaving which is why they are recommended starting at 6 months of age. And the COVID vaccine is safe for pregnant people and babies before or during pregnancy and during breastfeeding. Delaying the COVID vaccine puts kids at greater risk of getting very sick or even dying.

Remember

Your child's doctor can answer questions about the vaccine and updated booster. COVID vaccination is safe and it works. It also is the best tool we have so we can stop the spread of virus variants and protect your child from COVID.

According to an order from Circuit Judge William Ogletree all claims in the lawsuit have been resolved and all terms of the monetary settlement including previously existing settlements ""shall remain confidential"" between Gadsden Water and defendants 3M Company Shaw Industries Inc. Mohawk Carpet LLC Mohawk Industries Inc. and Industrial Chemicals Inc.

Gadsden Water Works and Sewer Board files lawsuit over water pollution

The lawsuit claimed the defendants were responsible for putting perfluorooctane sulfonate and perflurooctanic acid into the city's raw water supply. That caused Gadsden Water to have higher readings of those man-made chemicals according to press release at the time the suit was filed by the Beasley Allen Law Firm.

After the EPA issued new lifetime exposure limits for those chemicals in May 2016 eight water systems in Alabama received advisory warnings including Gadsden's. The advisory focused on PFOAs and PFOs the man-made chemical compounds used in the manufacture of non-stick stain-resistant and waterproofing coatings on fabric cookware firefighting foam and other consumer products the lawsuit said. According to attorneys for Gadsden Water the EPA says exposure to the chemicals even in trace amounts can promote serious health problems over time.

""The Gadsden Water Works and Sewer Board and its customers did not put these chemicals in the water. This lawsuit says very clearly that they should not be responsible for removing them either"" attorney Rhon Jones said.

GWW General Manager Chad Hare said the agency is pleased the lawsuit has been resolved.

""This is monumental for customers of Gadsden Water and all of Etowah County as the mutually agreed upon settlement will result in the construction of what will be the State of Alabama’s largest reverse osmosis treatment facility to provide our customers with PFAS-free drinking water"" Hare said.

""Our customers will not be asked to pay for the treatment required to remove a chemical that they did not place there"" he said. ""For the City of Gadsden this settlement represents a bright and clean future for economic development and growth.""

Hare said the authority is aggressively addressing construction of the treatment facility having voted already to authorize the him to solicit proposals from qualified engineering consulting firms for the design bid and construction administration of the new RO facility.

""The Water Works Board thanks its customers for their patience during this legal process"" Hare said.

The Institute for the Study of War said in its analysis of the battleground in Ukraine on Tuesday said Ukraine’s troops were also advancing in Kharkiv and Luhansk in the northeast and east.



In the south of the country Ukrainian forces began to collapse the “sparsely–man” Russian front line and pushed troops back toward Kherson city the capital of the homonymous region the ISW said.

Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly address late Tuesday that the army was leading a “fairly rapid and powerful advance” in the south and that dozens of settlements had been liberated in Kherson Kharkiv Luhansk and Donetsk.



An intelligence report from the British defense ministry published Wednesday said: “Ukraine continues to make progress in offensive operations along both the north-eastern and southern fronts. In the north-east in Kharkiv Oblast Ukraine has now consolidated a substantial area of territory east of the Oskil River.”



The report said it was “highly likely” that Ukrainian troops could strike the Svatove-Kremina road an important supply chain for Russian troops in the Luhansk region behind the new front line following Ukraine’s lightning counteroffensive in the region which has resulted in the liberation of Izyum in Kharkiv region and Lyman in Donetsk.

The latest Ukrainian gains on the battlefield came as the illegal annexation of Donetsk Luhansk Kherson and Zaporizhzhia was formalized by the Kremlin.



Vladimir Putin Russia’s president signed the annexation laws on Wednesday after they were rubber-stamped by lawmakers.

The escalatory move in the conflict which followed a series of hastily organized referendums that have been roundly dismissed by Kyiv and the international community was ratified despite Russia’s only partial occupation of the regions.

Ukraine’s industrial heartlands Donetsk and Luhansk collectively referred to as the Donbas have been under the partial control of pro-Russian separatists since a rebellion in 2014 the same year Putin annexed Crimea.



Kherson and Zaporizhzhia have been partially occupied since Putin launched his full-scale invasion in February this year. EFE

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has released the Medicare Advantage and Part D Star Ratings for 2023.

In all 57 contracts earned five stars down significantly from 74 last year. There were 67 contracts that earned 4.5 stars (down from 96 last year); 136 that earned four stars (compared to 152); 116 that earned 3.5 stars (compared to 122); and 90 that earned three stars up from 25 last year.

Some of the major parent companies earning five stars are Kaiser Foundation Health Plans and UnitedHealth Group. Five Kaiser plans earned five stars this year while nine five-star plans belong to companies owned by UnitedHealth Group. Humana and Highmark also boasted numerous five-star plans.

Significantly 37 plans earned 2.5 stars compared to just two last year; at the same time four plans earned two stars compared to none last year. All four two-star plans are Wellcare by Centene Corporation.

One star represents poor performance and five stars represents excellent performance.

Star ratings are released annually and reflect the experiences of people enrolled in Medicare Advantage and Part D prescription drug plans. The system supports CMS' efforts to empower people to make healthcare decisions that are best for them the agency said.

People with Medicare can compare quality through the star ratings along with other information such as cost and coverage on the online Medicare Plan Finder tool available on Medicare.gov.

The star ratings are important to both insurers selling private Medicare Advantage plans and to beneficiaries who are looking for Medicare coverage. Star ratings reflect a plan's performance and are related to quality bonus payments.

CMS changed the methodology for the 2023 star ratings and also removed guardrails that protected plans during the height of the pandemic. Star ratings affect 5% quality bonus payments made to plans.

The nine announced last week participated in an eight-month-long pilot of the Health Equity Accreditation (HEA) Plus program—meant to build on the existing HEA program. The Plus program is for participants with a solid foundation for addressing equity that are seeking to partner with community-based organizations to better address their patients’ or members’ social needs.

The nine organizations are:

1. Aetna Better Health of Michigan

2. Geisinger Health Plan

3. Health Net of California

4. Hennepin Healthcare

5. Molina Healthcare of California Partner Plan

6. Novant Health

7. Simply Healthcare Plans

8. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan

9. UPMC For You

Not only did they participate in the program and partner with community groups they also helped hone the program for future participants NCQA confirmed to Fierce Healthcare. In selecting this cohort of partner participants NCQA wanted organizations across the stakeholder continuum that had a strong history of addressing health equity and were geographically diverse. As the cohort went through the program it also partook in a unique peer-to-peer learning experience.

The cohort’s completion is an “important validation of the NCQA health equity standards” NCQA Director of Health Equity Initiatives Bryan Buckley said in a press release. “As more states require Health Equity Accreditation these first organizations to earn Health Equity Accreditation Plus will stand out as examples for others to emulate.”

Health equity is key to improved quality and safety and Novant Health is committed to it ""beyond merely a program but as a culture change strategy” said Chere Gregory M.D. senior vice president and chief health equity officer at Novant Health in an announcement. “We look forward to the advancement of health equity through continued partnership and best-practice learnings between other entities participating in this program.”

The program launched earlier this year after COVID illuminated “the value creation of cross-sectional partnerships” Buckley told Fierce Healthcare. “Health equity is a team sport; it can’t be done by any one organization.” It is an extension of the existing HEA program which provides a framework for developing standardized processes to address health inequities as an organization.

As of mid-2021 six state agencies (PDF) required this distinction. This distinction is also a prerequisite for the HEA Plus program but organizations can pursue both at the same time. As health systems move away from the immediate demands of the COVID pandemic more are expressing interest in the HEA Plus accreditation Buckley said.

NCQA hopes to keep in touch with participants to see how their work evolves and what they learn along the way. “Partnerships require constant learning” he said. “This is just only the first step.”

The status of each subsequent organization that earns a distinction will be updated on the NCQA site.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDEzbm93LmNvbS9uZXdzL2ZveC0xMy1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0ZXMvdXRhaC1pbnN1cmFuY2UtY29tcGFuaWVzLXNlYXJjaC1mb3ItcGF0aWVudHMtd2hvLXdlcmUtZGVuaWVkLXRyZWF0bWVudNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FOX 13 Investigates: Utah insurance providers search for patients who were denied treatment,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDEzbm93LmNvbS9uZXdzL2ZveC0xMy1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0ZXMvdXRhaC1pbnN1cmFuY2UtY29tcGFuaWVzLXNlYXJjaC1mb3ItcGF0aWVudHMtd2hvLXdlcmUtZGVuaWVkLXRyZWF0bWVudNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC80D1ED0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDEzbm93LmNvbS9uZXdzL2ZveC0xMy1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0ZXMvdXRhaC1pbnN1cmFuY2UtY29tcGFuaWVzLXNlYXJjaC1mb3ItcGF0aWVudHMtd2hvLXdlcmUtZGVuaWVkLXRyZWF0bWVudNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnphY2tzLmNvbS9zdG9jay9uZXdzLzE5ODgxODEvdW5pdGVkaGVhbHRoLXVuaC1ncm93cy1vbi1vcHR1bS1zdHJlbmd0aC1jb3N0LXdvZXMtc3RhedIBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnphY2tzLmNvbS9hbXAvc3RvY2svbmV3cy8xOTg4MTgxL3VuaXRlZGhlYWx0aC11bmgtZ3Jvd3Mtb24tb3B0dW0tc3RyZW5ndGgtY29zdC13b2VzLXN0YXk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UnitedHealth (UNH) Grows on Optum Strength Cost Woes Stay,"This page has not been authorized sponsored or otherwise approved or endorsed by the companies represented herein.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.20% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1 1988 through April 1 2024.

CHICAGO Oct. 6 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE: TAP) today announces a new partnership with the Professional Pickleball Association (PPA). The new agreement will pair the company's iconic beverages with one of the hottest sports in the United States and will make Vizzy the first-ever ""Official Hard Seltzer of the PPA Tour.""

Vizzy Becomes Official Hard Seltzer of the Professional Pickleball Association (PPA) Tour.

Described as a cross between tennis badminton and ping-pong pickleball has been around since the 1960s but saw a national resurgence during the pandemic. Since then it's exploded in popularity drawing in 4.6 million players and becoming the nation's fastest-growing sport according to the Sports & Fitness Industry Association.

""When watching a sport like pickleball you need to drink something just as bold and fun—which is why we're so excited to match the wide variety of the Molson Coors portfolio with the PPA as their official alcohol beverage partner"" said Bill Averill Molson Coors' vice president of field marketing. ""Led by our vibrant and flavorful Vizzy Hard Seltzer family which includes everything from tropical fruit to mimosa flavors we can't wait to serve a whole new vibe on and off the court and establish Vizzy as the leading hard seltzer playing in pickleball.""

Vizzy will go big to bring this partnership to life across all touchpoints including on-site activations at events out-of-home advertising retail merch as well as digital and social media influencer content. This builds on Vizzy's momentum as a top 5 hard seltzer as the brand continues to widen the gap between declining competing brands in the category according to IRI multi-outlet and convenience data.

As the exclusive beer hard seltzer and flavored malt beverage partner of the PPA Molson Coors will also bring Miller Lite and offerings from its above premium innovation portfolio like Simply Spiked Lemonade to select PPA tournaments across the country. Plus pickleball fans will also be able to enjoy non-alc products from Molson Coors including ZOA Energy and ZenWTR alkaline water which will join the PPA's existing assortment of non-alc offerings.

""Pickleball isn't just a sport it's a lifestyle and those who know the game can testify to the fact that pickleball brings together some of the best things in life — family health fun — the list goes on"" said Connor Pardoe Commissioner and CEO of the PPA Tour. ""Bringing aboard Molson Coors and Vizzy Hard Seltzer builds on this idea and helps bring people together whether they're competing on-court or cheering from the sidelines.""

The Molson Coors and PPA partnership kicks off with the PPA Championship in Las Vegas this week.

Mencken ever actually said “No one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public” verbatim. But we — as in me and you dear Hop Take reader — do know that the red-hot malt-/sugar-based hard seltzer boom of the past few years is currently giving way to the rise of spirits-based canned cocktails. The age of White Claw is in its twilight and soon the High Noon epoch begins in earnest. So we find ourselves with a contradiction in terms and SKUs as major firms roll out ready-to-drink distilled versions of brands they’re currently selling in fermented form and hope the American drinking public doesn’t notice.

Does a tequila-based cocktail invalidate a sugar-based iteration of similar drinks that bear the same label? Only if the customer grasps the difference and Menckian logic tells us pretty emphatically that they won’t. Luckily we don’t have to wonder though because Molson Coors and Coca-Cola are going to run the simulation for us in real time with Topo Chico’s beverage-alcohol aspirations and the alcohol-intelligence quotient of the United States consumer hanging in the balance.

What is the point of selling two styles of booze under the same banner besides the unquenchable shareholder thirst for more money and a conviction most customers won’t know the difference? Alas the Big Beverage tandem behind Topo Chico hard seltzer and its soon-to-come spirits-based brethren had no answer not for Hop Take at least. Coke didn’t respond to my request for an interview and no one was available from Molson Coors before deadline to talk Topo. (Or chat Chico? Either way it didn’t happen.) But in the absence of corporate wisdom we press on. Let’s consider the facts at hand.

Don't Miss A Drop Get the latest in beer wine and cocktail culture sent straight to your inbox.

First: Topo Chico didn’t start as a beverage-alcohol brand. The bubbly drink hails from a volcanic spring in Mexico that gained popularity as a #wellness spa for fin de siècle American medical tourists. But a century later Topo Chico’s reputation stateside had pivoted from restorative to refreshment its iconic glass bottles a byword for desert authenticity (and hipster approximations of it too). The niche brand’s controversial 2017 sale of U.S. rights to Coca-Cola Company didn’t upset me any more than the accumulative tendencies of global capital do generally but I understand why people were mad. Nothing gold can stay including lucrative beverages in an increasingly globalized consumer packaged goods landscape. Soon plastic-bottled Topo Chicos started showing up on supermarket shelves and Amazon wish lists thrilling far-flung fans and appalling people who understand the carbonation-retention differentials of PET versus glass. Coke’s 2020 “brand authorization partnership” with Molson Coors to introduce Topo Chico hard seltzer followed apace.

It was the obvious move. Acquisition aside the mineral water still maintains a cult-like appeal with American drinkers and the traditional firewall between alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverage brands had by then eroded to the point that Topo Chico’s Big Red handlers could see the dollar signs on the other side. The 2020 tie-up has paid off: Since hitting the American market in 2021 Topo Chico hard seltzer has been on a no-bullshit heater as one of the fastest-growing hard seltzers in the segment. Its success has paved the way for the alcoholization of other popular soft drinks in Coke’s portfolio like Simply Lemonade and Fresca. (Those boozed-up versions are produced in partnership with Molson Coors and Constellation Brands respectively.)

That Topo Chico’s hard seltzers are reportedly made with regular ol’ filtered fizz rather than the titular mineral water from Monterrey hasn’t held it back from its race to the near-top of the segment either. “I was expecting the giant bubbles that make it nearly impossible to chug an ice-cold Topo and was sorely disappointed” wrote the Houston Chronicle’s Abigail Rosenthal in her March 2021 review of the then-new hard seltzer. “Topo Chico is well known for its aggressive bubbles and the usual Topo crispness was missing from the cans of seltzer.” Nevertheless the hard seltzers have charged hard in Texas and the Southwest from the very beginning. Mencken would be impressed.

Beyond the core pack Topo Chico’s Ranch Water and Margarita hard seltzer varietals are also selling like gangbusters which is no surprise given the underlying brand’s close affiliation with Mexico and the American Southwest. Of course Margaritas and Ranch Waters are traditionally made with full-proof tequila not the fermented sugar that makes Topo Chico’s hard seltzers hard. The agave spirit as you may have heard has been on a no-bullshit heater of its own. It’s projected to surpass both vodka and whiskey to become the top-selling spirit in the United States as soon as next year and is tied for first with vodka as the top base spirit for ready-to-drink canned cocktails. So in one sense Molson Coors’ recent announcement that tequila-based Topo Chico canned cocktails are headed our way in 2023 was preordained; as hard seltzer settles into the single-digit year-over-year sales of a maturing segment the macrobrewer “beverage company” has gotta find growth elsewhere. Spirits-based canned cocktails are sold for more money in different less-crowded places and drinkers want ‘em. It’s no surprise that’s where Molson Coors is steering the brand next.

Of course Topo Chico isn’t the only hard seltzer heavyweight headed for the higher price points and higher-end ~vibes~ in which High Noon the vodka-based Barstool-backed E. & J. Gallo juggernaut has been basking. Truly second only to White Claw in the slim-can stampede rolls out a vodka version next week. [Disclosure: I previously owned some stock in Truly’s corporate parent Boston Beer Company from which I divested prior to taking over this column in order to cover the firm directly without conflict of interest. I own no individual stocks related to my coverage.] But as a natural mixer for clear liquors of all kinds Topo Chico is poised to go further and faster than its FMB rivals. As Molson Coors’ VP of next generation beverages David Coors boasted to distributors last week: “We see a big opportunity in tequila RTDs and it just so happens we have the powerhouse brand that’s synonymous with tequila cocktails.”

To which Hop Take says: “yes and.” While spirits-based RTDs are a logical next step for the brand fermented Topo Chico hard seltzer is still very much for sale and will continue to be. What’s the difference? So glad you asked. “These are real cocktails not hard seltzer” vice president of innovations Jamie Wideman told the firm’s middle-tier partners per a Brewbound report. But! But! “Real” cocktails imply the existence of fake ones. An informed consumer might reasonably ask Molson Coors to explain the difference between that product — let’s call it TC(F) for Topo Chico (Fermented) — and the new distilled spirits-based line which we’ll call TC(D). After all those TC(F) Margaritas and Ranch Waters they’ve been guzzling down are advertised as “inspired by the classic Margarita” with “hints of real lime salt and tequila.” Upon learning that these are just marketing semantics — “inspired by the truth” with “hints of reality” you might say — they might be a bit miffed. And when they see the new TC(D) drinks at the store actually boast an actual tequila base and cost a few more bucks per variety pack… well from where your humble Hop Take columnist is sitting it’d be reasonable for that informed consumer to ask Molson Coors WT(F)?

If the firm is betting that most rank-and-file drinkers won’t think this hard about it I wouldn’t take the other side of the wager. But the courts are a different bag of chips and even before the advent of tequila- and vodka-based Topo Chicos Coke found itself posed with a legalese version of this question in the form of a class-action lawsuit. Filed in August Warren vs. The Coca-Cola Company alleges that Topo Chico hard seltzer’s margarita pack makes “false and misleading representations” about its booze type in order to command higher prices from unsuspecting drinkers who think they’re buying proper tequila-based margs.

“There’s just such a blending of these categories” Spencer Sheehan the attorney representing the plaintiff in the case tells Hop Take. Topo Chico’s various non-alcoholic and alcoholic offerings “make it very confusing about what it is you’re getting. So they need to do a much better job at being truthful.” The lawyer known to industry critics as the “vanilla vigilante” for the “tsunami of lawsuits” he’s filed over food label listings of the bean in question contends that the fuzzy legal definition of “hard seltzer” has created a gray area ripe for misleading confused customers over the booze they’re buying. In the suit — which is just getting underway in federal magistrate court — Sheehan also echoes the Chronicle’s complaint arguing the fermented marg is fugazi because it “does not contain the sparkling mineral water sourced in Monterrey Mexico which is an essential part of Topo Chico beverages.” As you might guess he views the recent TC(D) announcement as just more evidence that Molson Coors intentionally mislabeled TC(F) to bamboozle consumers into paying more for less. After all real cocktails imply the existence of fake ones.

🤯 Hop-ocalypse Now

Remember when craft breweries used to eschew high-ABV adjunct-heavy bang-for-buck beers as juvenile perversions of the almighty artisanal form? Hop Take can’t either. Anyway Brewbound reports that in 2023 Kirin Holdings Lion Little World Beverages New Belgium Brewing will roll out a “sequel” to its wildly popular 9.5 percent ABV Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA called — wait for it — Fruit Force. The new “fruit punch IPA” label bears the brand’s familiar skeletal fighter pilot dressed up in a sharp new uniform. Pretty sure there’s a “Top Gun” / “Top Gun 2” joke in here somewhere: Tom Booze? Highway to the Ranger Zone? Talk to Me Juice? Hmm… can’t quite land it.

📈 Ups…

To continue mixing Hollywood and fighter-pilot metaphors bombers remain very dead but craft breweries are rebooting the bankable 12-oz can… OK I’ll stop: Big Beer makes nutrition-labeling moves… Distributors have less at-risk beer than recent past says NBWA… Calif. haircut-in-chief Gavin Newsom signs taproom-expansion bill…

Just one day after revealing a 16 million case deal for Capitol Wright Distributing near Austin Texas the largest beer wholesaler in the U.S. announced today an agreement to acquire Paradise Beverage in Hawaii the company’s 12th market.

The transaction is slated to close in early December. Once closed Reyes will add about 8.9 million cases and 2300 customers to its operations. Key suppliers include Molson Coors Constellation Brands Boston Beer Company Diageo Heineken USA and Maui Brewing.

The addition of Paradise Capitol Wright (slated to close in December) and DET Distributing in Tennessee (expected to close in November) will put Reyes’ case volume firmly above 300 million cases.

Reyes will operate Paradise under the Hawaii Beverage LLC banner and maintain the distributor’s five facilities across the state.

“On the heels of announcing new business in Tennessee and Texas we are humbled by this opportunity in Hawaii” Reyes Beer Division CEO Tom Day said in a press release. “We are fortunate to be in the position of accelerated growth that we’re in today – and it’s all thanks to our hard working teams. We wouldn’t be here or be approached for opportunities like these without our employees their high standards of excellence and the service they provide to our suppliers and customers every day.”

Tom Reyes president of Reyes Beer Division West noted in the release that the Paradise deal is the first expansion of the Reyes Beer Division West footprint outside of California.

“Paradise and Reyes have similar missions and values rooted in integrity and excellence and we are eager to join our teams and get to work” he added.

“Our family has been incredibly honored to have been owners of Paradise Beverages for over four decades and it is bittersweet to say goodbye to this company and its exceptional group of people” Anderson Holdings chairman and CEO William Anderson said in the release. “I am extremely grateful to John Erickson president of Paradise Beverages for his exemplary leadership and his team’s hard work to build an organization of which our family is very proud. We strongly believe that Reyes is the right owner going forward and will continue to build on Paradise’s strong performance and deliver excellence for our many long-term customers employees and the Hawaiian business community.”

Paradise Beverage was founded in 1948 as the Crockett Sales Company according to its website. The company which adopted its current name in 1976 grew by acquisition several times in its history adding the Coors and Stroh brands in 1980 and the portfolio of McKesson Wine & Spirits in 1988. Paradise acquired rights to Miller in 1995 and Heineken and Samuel Adams in 1996.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyZXdib3VuZC5jb20vbmV3cy95dWVuZ2xpbmctaGVyc2hleXMtY2hvY29sYXRlLXBvcnRlci1yZXR1cm5zLWZvci1saW1pdGVkLXRpbWUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Yuengling Hershey's Chocolate Porter Returns for Limited Time,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.brewbound.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/yuengling-hersheys-chocolate-porter-returns-for-limited-time/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC9B033A0>, 'Connection to www.brewbound.com timed out.

Using the mass balance approach the post-consumer recycled plastic packaging will be independently certified by ISCC and supplied in partnership with Amcor a global leader in developing and producing responsible packaging for food and other industries and signals the high demand for this material within the UK.

The company said it is part of its wider global goal to reduce the use of virgin plastic material in its overall plastic packaging portfolio by 5% by 2025 ‘assuming constant portfolio mix’.

Mondelēz said this latest project on Cadbury Dairy Milk is another example of how it is delivering the company’s‘ Pack Light and Right’ sustainable packaging strategy and its efforts toward the UK Plastic Pact targets.

Dirk Van de Put CEO Mondelēz International said the UK is leading the way in its use of recycled material and investing in solutions for a circular economy for packaging waste. “Until recently flexible plastic packaging has been considered a single use material. The development of advanced recycling technology and our significant investment in this material means it’s now possible for Cadbury fans to enjoy their favourite sharing bars more sustainably here in the UK​.”

Earlier this year Mondelēz International again joined forces with the industry to lead finance and launch the UK’s biggest flexible plastic household collection and recycling pilot – Flex Collect. The pilot will inform UK Government how to incorporate flexible packaging into existing collection services across different geographies and demographics developing best practice and giving confidence to the recycling and packaging supply chain to invest in advanced recycling facilities that can process this material.

Van de Put said the company is committed to using more recycled packaging as access and availability of advanced recycling technology increases.

“I am enormously proud to witness this important innovation to our iconic Cadbury packaging made in Bournville – the heart and home of Cadbury” ​said Louise Stigant UK Managing Director Mondelēz International.“We are very keen to reduce our use of virgin plastic across our full range and this innovation signals our demand for this material and much needed investment into the UK recycling infrastructure to produce it​.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lZGlhcG9zdC5jb20vcHVibGljYXRpb25zL2FydGljbGUvMzc4NDM1L2RvdWJsZXZlcmlmeS1sYXVuY2hlcy1hdHRlbnRpb24tbWVhc3VyZW1lbnQtbW9uZGUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DoubleVerify Launches Attention Measurement Mondelez First To Use 10/06/2022,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.mediapost.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /publications/article/378435/doubleverify-launches-attention-measurement-monde.html (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC7CB7850>, 'Connection to www.mediapost.com timed out.

The text messages uncovered as part of the disclosure process in the Delaware Court of Chancery have been a crucial part of the process. They’ve also been extremely interesting. If everyone concerned hadn’t been so diligent about obeying the “business related communications” policy we’d have been deprived of a number of insights into a modern tech banking transaction.

From a banking point of view the thing that jumps out of the messages is the extent to which Morgan Stanley owns this deal. Although plenty of other banks are mentioned in the big court filing made public last week MS is the only sellside firm where Twitter’s lawyers cite specific bankers working on the deal; Michael Grimes Anthony Armstrong Kate Claasen and Owen O’Keefe as well as leveraged finance head Andrew Earls and CEO James Gorman (who put in some CEO schmooze calling Elon a “rocket ship”).

Goldman JP Morgan and BoA are all in the disclosure request and Robert Steel of Perella Weinberg has a small appearance but it’s Michael Grimes the notoriously hard-working tech coverage banker who seems to have been the trusted advisor to Musk. He introduced investors suggested temporary CFOs and forwarded YouTube links. And although the relationship was occasionally tetchy it seems that it was genuine – at one point in the quoted messages Elon says “The Morgan Stanley deal team is truly excellent and I don’t say such things lightly”.

But of course “owning this deal” could be a double-edged sword. Musk has now indicated that the deal is back on at the original price and subject to the original financing. Banks are expected to supply $13bn. And yet conditions in the leveraged finance market have changed a lot since the terms were agreed for Musk/Twitter. Any bank putting up the finance now would be looking at an uphill struggle to syndicate it and most likely an immediate writedown. Basically it would be another bigger version of the Citrix deal from last week and the $192m in deal fees would be only small compensation.

Which means that some of the best bankers on the Street might be about to burn the midnight oil on a deal that they really don’t want to be part of for a client that doesn’t want to do the deal. In terms of the ratio of pain to reward this might even beat the Saudi Aramco IPO for the nightmare of the century. And unless there’s a last minute ten-dimensional legal chess move it doesn’t appear that there’s any way out of it. The final irony of course is that of the two big banks who have been most discussed on Twitter so far this week – Credit Suisse and Deutsche – neither seems to be in this deal. Sometimes it’s better to be on the outside looking in.

Elsewhere congratulations to Joseph O’Docherty who has moved from Barclays to Mizuho Americas where he will be a Managing Director and the new head of residential mortgage finance according to Bloomberg. It’s a greenfield site; Mizuho is setting up a brand-new mortgage securitization business at what might be considered a surprising time in the market cycle.

However maybe it’s the very best time for them to be doing this. The problems that other players are having in the RMBS market are to do with legacy positions and litigation and high capital requirements. A new player coming in with a clean slate financed by a parent company with surplus capital and no existing market share to maintain or client base to serve … well in the short term Joseph O’Docherty will be able to cherry-pick some of the best deals and in the medium term there might be some top talent coming on to the market as players like Credit Suisse cut back. The proverb about being greedy when others are fearful and vice versa might have some validity to it.

Meanwhile ...

It’s finally happened … although Ray Dalio is staying on the board and taking the title “CIO Mentor” he’s giving up his voting rights and CIO job; he no longer “has the final world”. The new team – CEO Nir Bar Dea and co-CIOs Bob Prince and Greg Jensen – intend to make a few changes to the famous management practices making them less intense and “investing in tech and people”. Let’s hope Ray doesn’t live to regret it in the way that so many investment management founders did. (Bloomberg)

A logjam of more than 100 ships tugboats and their convoys of barges in the shrinking Mississippi River is threatening to grind trade of grains fertilizer metals and petroleum to a halt.

The largest U.S. barge operator warned customers it won’t be able to make good on deliveries. Ingram Barge Co. declared force majeure in a letter to customers due to “near-historic” low water conditions on the Mississippi the top route to get U.S. grains and soybeans to the world market.

Drought has reduced water levels along the biggest U.S. waterway by so much that vessels are running aground. The Coast Guard is responding to grounded vessels in at least two places near Stack Island between Louisiana and Mississippi and upriver near Memphis according to a statement. American Commercial Barge Line another shipping company said on in a post on its website that it’s the most severe impact to navigation since 1988.

Covered barges full of grain and soy float from U.S. farm country to terminals in the Gulf of Mexico while crude oil refined products and imported steel also travel through sections of the waterway. Some 60% of all grain exported from the U.S. is shipped on the Mississippi River through the Port of New Orleans and the Port of South Louisiana according to the National Park Service.

The logjam is coming at the worst time as the soybean and corn harvests are each about one-fifth complete and supplies will start piling up. The river woes coupled with a soaring dollar are destroying demand for U.S. supplies even with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine still impeding shipments in the Black Sea.

“We’re losing demand because of reduced export capacity” Susan David grain analyst in St. Louis said by phone. “We’re creating piles everywhere.”

The Coast Guard said there was a queue of 122 vessels at Stack Island and 15 vessels at Memphis. Due to increased groundings the number of vessels in tow is being restricted.

Meanwhile any snags in fertilizer shipments — which farmers rely on to plant crops for next year — are happening as nutrients to grow food have soared and as Hurricane Ian temporarily shut production at a Mosaic Co. fertilizer plant in Florida.

“The Mississippi River is vital to the fertilizer transportation network” said Alexis Maxwell an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.

A peaking La Nina is limiting storms coming in from the southwest that would replenish rivers and any significant relief is unlikely through the first 10 days of November according to World Weather Inc. president Drew Lerner.

“I don’t have a major storm coming up for the balance of the month” Lerner said. “I’m a little pessimistic and not feeling good about the situation.”

Brown Chair in Cell Biology and Neuroscience by Rutgers Board of ...,"Danielle Dick

The Rutgers University Board of Governors has appointed Robert Wood Johnson Medical School psychiatry professor Danielle Dick as the inaugural holder of the Gregory Q. Brown Chair in Cell Biology and Neuroscience.

Dick is an internationally-recognized academic leader in substance use addiction and mental health research. In January 2022 she became the inaugural director of the Rutgers Addiction Research Center (RARC) the only comprehensive addiction center in the state that integrates precision medicine research training treatment and care of individuals and families coping with addiction and public policy innovation and reform to prevent drug use and improve access to treatment.

“I am honored to hold the Greg Brown Endowed Chair and lead the development of the Rutgers Addiction Research Center. With award-winning researchers training programs and clinical services Rutgers is well on its way to becoming a national leader in tackling addiction and I am excited to work with the community to propel our growth” Dick said.

Dick’s research looks to identify and characterize the risk associated with genes that influence addiction and substance use disorders to help inform both prevention and intervention. She has published more than 350 peer-reviewed journal articles and has led or contributed to more than 20 National Institutes of Health research grants totaling over $30 million—earning her the distinction of being one of the top 1.5 percent most highly cited researchers across all fields of science.

While she is most highly cited in scientific arenas Dick also frequently brings her expertise out of clinical settings and directly to the public. She often speaks with parents families and school groups about substance use disorders and how to prevent or address problems in children and family members. She is the author of The Child Code: Understanding your child’s unique nature for happier more effective parenting (2021 Avery an imprint of Penguin Random House).

The Gregory Q. Brown Chair in Cell Biology and Neuroscience was established with a generous gift from the board of directors of Motorola Solutions Inc. in honor of the company’s chairman and CEO Gregory Q.

The relative outperformance of energy stocks contributed significantly to the underperformance but the return contribution from carbon-efficient companies within each sector was positive.

Within the energy sector companies with strong management of low-carbon transition risks outperformed their peers highlighting the importance of managing these risks.

High oil prices continued to be the dominant global headline in the third quarter. But MSCI Climate Indexes1 — with historically lower allocations to energy companies — showed greater resilience in the third quarter than the second. For investors a key question may be how close they seek to hew to the MSCI ACWI parent index in their climate allocations.

The energy sector — proxied by the MSCI ACWI Energy Index — outperformed the MSCI ACWI by 5.43% in the third quarter. But how individual MSCI Climate Indexes performed in the quarter reflected their respective approaches.

For example the MSCI ACWI Climate Change and MSCI ACWI Climate Paris Aligned indexes significantly underweighted energy stocks (see exhibit below) adversely impacting performance of these indexes relative to the MSCI ACWI. Historically they have exhibited higher tracking error during periods of high volatility (like the Russia-Ukraine war).

In contrast the MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Leaders and MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target Indexes jointly referred as “Low Carbon indexes” have tighter controls on sector exposures and were underweight energy to a lesser extent than the other climate indexes. As a result they historically have performed closer to the parent MSCI ACWI Index. In the third quarter the MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Leaders Index performed better than the MSCI ACWI by 0.06% while the MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target Index underperformed by 0.18%.

Active energy allocations for the MSCI ACWI Climate Indexes

Differences between the energy sector allocation in the MSCI ACWI climate indexes and the MSCI ACWI. Active allocations represent over- or under-weights to the energy sector as of June 30 2022.

Short-term vs. long-term performance

TThe exhibit below shows the short- and long-term performance of the MSCI ACWI Climate Indexes. While the MSCI ACWI Climate Change and Climate Paris Aligned Indexes have historically outperformed the MSCI ACWI over longer time periods they underperformed the MSCI ACWI in the second quarter. This short-term underperformance continued in the third quarter although the level of underperformance was lower.

Historical active returns for the MSCI ACWI Climate Indexes

ACWI Low Carbon Leaders ACWI Low Carbon Target ACWI Climate Change ACWI Climate Paris Aligned Q3 2022 0.06% -0.18% -0.18% -0.35% Q2 2022 0.21% -0.33% -1.15% -0.59% YTD 0.12% -0.58% -2.19% -1.83% 1 Year 0.12% -0.58% -1.43% -1.72% 3 Years 0.15% -0.10% 0.78% 0.12% 5 Years 0.14% -0.03% 0.65% 0.40% Long term 0.08% -0.01% 0.74% 0.80%

Active returns represent the difference between each climate index and the parent MSCI ACWI. Gross returns for the period ending Sept. 30 2022. Long-term returns are measured between Nov. 29 2013 and Sept. 30 2022. Returns are annualized for periods longer than a year.

Drilling down to sector and industry levels

Industry allocations especially the underweights to oil-related industries (includes integrated oil and gas oil and gas and consumable fuels and oil and gas exploration and production) played a significant role again in the third quarter especially in the performance of the MSCI ACWI Climate Change and Climate Paris Aligned Indexes. These underweights detracted from the MSCI ACWI Climate Change Index by 19 basis points (bps) and by 21 bps for the MSCI ACWI Climate Paris Aligned Index in this period (see exhibit below). As expected oil-related industry allocations had a much smaller impact on the low-carbon indexes.

The MSCI ACWI Climate Change Index has a relatively higher U.S. allocation and the recent period of dollar strengthening generated a positive currency contribution. However this was neutralized by a higher China allocation.

The MSCI ACWI Climate Indexes aim to achieve a lower carbon footprint than the broader MSCI ACWI Index. Selections of carbon-efficient companies within each sector contributed positively for all four indexes which is similar to what we observed for the first half of the year.

Low-carbon transition-risk management of energy companies

While the energy sector outperformed the MSCI ACWI this quarter not all energy companies may be equally as efficient in transitioning to a low-carbon environment. We examined the performance of “Above average low carbon transition (LCT) risk management companies” in the MSCI ACWI Energy Index with higher (first and second quartile) LCT risk management2 scores to “Below average LCT risk management companies” with lower scores (third and fourth quartile companies). The above-average LCT risk management companies returned -0.76% for the quarter while the below-average LCT risk management companies returned -5.69% (as shown below).

It’s a wrap: Mixed results

The MSCI ACWI Climate Indexes had varied performance in the third quarter. While the MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Leaders Index outperformed the MSCI ACWI Index all other ACWI Climate indexes underperformed although the scale of underperformance was lower than the previous quarter. Tighter controls on sector allocations for the low-carbon indexes helped them weather energy’s outperformance. Allocations to carbon-efficient companies within each sector also contributed positively to the performance of the climate indexes. While the outperformance of energy stocks detracted from the performance of the ACWI Climate Indexes energy companies with a superior climate risk management outperformed their sector peers.

""Deeply funny"" was the rave refrain

It was just the thing for their Q4

It'll be on stands before the holidays

Father John Misty; Q4

There’s nothing funny about the performance of U.S. equities in 2022. As we close the books on Q3 a few things stand out. At present the 34% drawdown from highs represents the worst stretch for the Nasdaq-100® Index (NDX) since 2007/2008.

The NDX fell for the third consecutive quarter with another 4.63% drop between July and September. It’s the first time the index has had three straight quarters in the red since the tech wreck of the early aughts. During the Global Financial Crisis the NDX managed one positive quarter in mid-2008 during a stretch that left it lower by roughly 45% at the bottom.

Between early 2000 and late 2002 the NDX declined by more than 80% but the composition of the NDX has changed significantly over the past twenty years. A far greater percentage of the constituents are profitable but the interest rate environment and risk appetite has weighed heavily on tech in 2022.

The Interest in Rates

A generation of investors have become accustomed to historically low and declining interest rates. The cost of capital influences essentially every facet of the domestic and global economy. On the heels of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis central banks across the world acted to lower short-term rates to bolster highly levered financial institutions and stimulate demand.

Source: MacroTrends

The Federal Reserve followed a similar path (reducing borrow rates) in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic which pushed the yield on the 10-year to all-time lows around half of 1% in the middle of 2020.

The efficacy is subject to debate but the impact of its effort to unwind more than a decade of loose monetary policy has rippled across asset classes. If the year ended today it would be the worst on record for 10-Year treasury returns.

Dollars and Sentiment

Currency markets are inextricably connected to interest rates and the strength in the U.S. dollar puts significant pressure on many emerging market economies. Sri Lanka Lebanon and Zambia have already defaulted on international debt this year.

Chinese firms (many state-owned) are struggling to service borrowing costs despite being part of the second largest economy in the world.

Are the Federal Reserve governors concerned about exporting some degree of inflation by way of their stronger dollar policy? Will politicians avoid future policy errors like those of the new Truss government in the U.K.?

No Quarter

There’s been essentially nowhere to hide in capital markets this year. Nearly $17 trillion in equity has been trimmed by the move in U.S. debt and equity markets since November of last year. Beyond that markets anticipate somewhere between 100 and 125 basis points in further hikes before year-end. Essentially the only indexes that have advanced in 2022 are those that measure forward volatility.

Long As I Can See the Light

There are clearly a variety of meaningful headwinds for investors as we move into Q4. The Fed continues to push tighter financial conditions which tend to pressure equities. By many measures the economy is slowing. The housing market is beginning to correct. The war in Ukraine has no clear end in sight. The short-term outlook is somewhere between dreary and desolate. If your horizon is long enough perhaps we can find the light.

Let’s broaden our attention from the Nasdaq-100 Index to the Nasdaq Composite Index. There have been seven previous 30% drawdowns since the index was introduced in 1971. Ben Carlson author of A Wealth of Common Sense highlighted the performance following such declines.

Interesting to note that on four of the seven occasions the Nasdaq Composite found a trough during the month of October. Is it possible we’ll have another tradeable bottom during the month? Time will tell. The average decline works out to ~45% but it’s skewed lower by the Dot Com implosion. In fact every average is weighed down by 2000-2002 data. Are we likely to have another “lost decade?”

The NDX closed below its 200-week moving average for the first time since August of 2008. That ~4-year average was tested during the 2010 selloff but support held. The markets have reversed roughly two years’ worth of advances in short order.

Looking forward there are two more Fed meetings as well as midterm elections before this year will end. Historically equity markets tend to underperform during midterm cycles but “seasonality” is positive in Q4 and following Election Day. Will Jerome Powell and company be able to thread the needle with future hikes? Will we avoid a Dot Com/Global Financial Crisis-like decline? Time will tell.

Throughout the year there’s been a shift in option volumes toward index products and away from single stocks. It’s possible to gain exposure to and/or hedge risk in the Nasdaq-100 Index using a notionally appropriate product.

Adena Friedman started at Nasdaq in 1993 as an MBA intern. Outside of a three-year stint as the chief financial officer at Carlyle Group Friedman has spent nearly 20 years at Nasdaq. In 2017 she became the first woman to lead a global exchange.

Friedman has pushed the exchange to use technology to democratize the capital markets. As a result Nasdaq has moved from a stock exchange into a powerhouse of technology data and analytics driving 130 global markets.

""Online trading changed everything about the industry"" she told Fortune last year.

By the late 1990s Nasdaq struggled to keep up with the startups that were quick to adopt new technological innovations. ""I was there at the time watching our market share go from 97 percent to 14 percent in trading"" she told a CEO summit a few years ago. ""We didn't weather that well.""

The company under her leadership and that of her predecessor pivoted by reinventing itself as a pure-play technology company. Today Nasdaq provides technology trading to more than 100 markets around the world.

""Complacency is the killer of every great company"" she said. ""In the blink of an eye things can change around you. Be ready for the change and embrace it.""

At the same time Friedman said it is okay for women leaders to sometimes feel risk averse. Women she wrote in Fortune several years ago tend to spend more time gathering facts when assessing opportunities and risks. ""We research more thoroughly including probing how the business can extricate itself if failure occurs"" she observed. That natural instinct she said ""should be something to be celebrated and replicated.""

Finance has always been in Friedman's blood. She grew up spending time at the trading desk of T. Rowe Price where her father worked. That helped turn her into being a ""big believer in capitalism."" Still she said it is apparent that investing and making money off of the stock market isn't always accessible to everyone. Nasdaq she said can help play a role in making capitalism more accessible.

During her career Friedman has acquired a few key life lessons: live in reality.; don't place all your bets on one killer app; and regulation is not the answer.

The killer app principal she said was particularly relevant when Nasdaq had to reinvent itself. ""Instead of being incremental and solving problems one at a time we had this big project that we thought would solve everything. Don't assume there is one panacea"" she cautioned.

Nasdaq also learned that they couldn't ask regulators to solve their problems for them. Freidman discovered that the only way forward was to compete and prove that Nasdaq was the best at what it did. ""As a country we value competition and the idea of allowing free markets to force everyone to up their game"" she said.

Friedman also believes that the financial services industry when managed responsibly and with the long-term interests of clients in mind serves as a critical component to building a stable and prosperous economy. Speaking at the UN several years ago Friedman laid out her vision. ""Properly addressing climate change will take multiple political cycles and many of our politicians do not exhibit patience as a virtue"" she said. ""But the capital markets can see past the politics and use the catalysts that are available to work together to create new incentives and disclosures.""

Diversity and inclusion is also top of mind for Friedman. In 2020 Nasdaq asked the SEC to require companies listed on its exchange to publish board diversity data. Companies without at least two ""diverse"" directors – one who identifies as a woman and one who identifies as an underrepresented minority or LBGTQ+—will have to explain the lack of diversity on their boards. ""Capitalism by its nature gives the greatest opportunity to unlock human potential"" she said. ""But you have to make sure the system is available to everyone.""

Ultimately Friedman says has learned about the importance of women and minority leaders by the way young people have expressed admiration for her own role at the helm of Nasdaq. ""I wasn't at all aware of the levels of influence that this appointment would have on people as they were looking up"" she told Forbes in 2019. ""I had a lot of young women come to me and say 'I can achieve anything now because I can see my way to the top'.""

But in the end it is performance not identity that defines one's job she said. ""My job is predicated on making Nasdaq an incredibly successful business for the long term. And whether I'm male or female that's what I'm going to be measured on.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hc2RhcS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvbmFzZGFxLWluZGV4LWZ1bmQtcGVyZm9ybWFuY2Utc2VwdGVtYmVyLTIwMjLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nasdaq Index Fund Performance: September 2022,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.nasdaq.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/nasdaq-index-fund-performance-september-2022 (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC92AA1D0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hc2RhcS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvbmFzZGFxLWluZGV4LWZ1bmQtcGVyZm9ybWFuY2Utc2VwdGVtYmVyLTIwMjLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nbG9iZW5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2UvMjAyMi8xMC8wNi8yNTI5NTYyLzAvZW4vQlRDUy1JbmMtQ2hhcmxlcy1BbGxlbi1DRU8tdG8tYmUtYS1GZWF0dXJlZC1HdWVzdC1vbi10aGUtRW1teS1Bd2FyZC1XaW5uaW5nLVRoZS1CaWctQml6LVJhZGlvLVNob3cuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BTCS Inc.

(NASDAQ:NTAP) Worth Looking At Closely?,"Let's talk about the popular NetApp Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP). The company's shares saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS rising to highs of US$78.56 and falling to the lows of US$61.85. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether NetApp's current trading price of US$66.56 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at NetApp’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.

See our latest analysis for NetApp

Is NetApp Still Cheap?

The share price seems sensible at the moment according to my price multiple model where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 15.25x is currently trading slightly below its industry peers’ ratio of 16.66x which means if you buy NetApp today you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that NetApp should be trading at this level in the long run then there’s not much of an upside to gain over and above other industry peers. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since NetApp’s share price is quite volatile we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.

Can we expect growth from NetApp?

Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. NetApp's earnings growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years indicating a solid future ahead. This should lead to robust cash flows feeding into a higher share value.

What This Means For You

Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in NTAP’s positive outlook with shares trading around industry price multiples. However there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at NTAP? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuate below the industry PE ratio?

Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on NTAP now may not be the most optimal time to buy given it is trading around industry price multiples. However the positive outlook is encouraging for NTAP which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

So while earnings quality is important it's equally important to consider the risks facing NetApp at this point in time. Every company has risks and we've spotted 1 warning sign for NetApp you should know about.

Following an earlier forecast that Netflix's domestic advertising revenues could hit about $1.2 billion by 2025 MoffettNathanson armed with more details about the potential pricing and rollout plans Netflix has in mind now expects the streaming company's global ad play to generate about $2.7 billion in advertising revenues by 2025. The estimate includes $1.7 billion in from Netflix's US and Canada (UCAN) business and $1 billion from the rest of the globe.

Figure 1: (Source: Netflix)

Though Netflix's coming ad play won't make much of a dent in 2022 it is expected to reach the $1 billion mark sometime in 2023.

""To be clear due to an initial low volume of impressions it is obviously unlikely that Netflix will see any real ad-revenues this year even if it launches its ad-supported offering as imminently as next month"" MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson explained in a new report (registration required) sizing up Netflix's budding ad business.

Nathanson believes that Netflix's ad revenues ""can ramp up quickly in 2023 to reach $1 billion"" – $700 million from UCAN and $300 million from about ten international markets that are expected to launch ad-supported tiers. The international projection is in reference to a report in The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) stating that Netflix already has its advertising sights set on ten non-UCAN markets: the U.K. Germany Italy Spain France Brazil Mexico South Korea Japan and Australia.

Citing a document that Netflix has shared with ad buyers WSJ said the streamer is projecting 4.4 million unique viewers worldwide at the end of 2022 growing to more than 40 million unique viewers by Q3 2023. Those viewers will exceed the number of subs on ad-supporting plans the publication added as it's likely that more than one person in a given subscribing household will be watching the service.

While Netflix's ad business is estimated to start driving in more than $1 billion in revenues next year and perhaps as much as $3.5 billion in 2027 that element will still represent a small slice of Netflix's overall pie.

Figure 2: Click here for a larger version of this image.

Hoping to revive subscriber growth

Another aim of Netflix's ad plan is to rejuvenate subscriber growth with less expensive plans. Industry watchers anticipate an initial price in the US of $7.99 per month for an ad-supported plan $2 less than Netflix's current base offering.

If that's the starting point in the US and representative of what will be marketed internationally Nathanson forecasts that Netflix will add a ""modest"" 1.8 million subs to the ad-supported tier in 2022. That's based on the assumption that Netflix will launch its ad-supported option by the middle of Q4 2022.

From there Nathanson expects the number to rise to 21.5 million subs in 2023 and 39 million by 2025. He expects it to exceed 48 million by 2027 (Netflix had more than 220 million subs on its existing ad-free tiers at the end of Q2 2022).

However the analyst expects most of the initial growth spurred by the ad-supported tier to come from ""existing subscribers spinning down."" To wit Nathanson's estimate of 1.8 million ad-supported subs in 2022 will only increase the company's total subscriber count by 200000. Incremental additions driven by the new ad-supported option are expected to improve in 2023 however to 4.1 million new subscribers.

""The balancing act Netflix must carefully weigh is providing an entry price or initial discounted offer that attracts new subscribers to its ad tier while at the same time not making it too attractive for existing subscribers of their two highest-priced plans to spin down to the cheaper package offsetting the incremental advertising revenues"" Nathanson explained.

With his new ad-related forecasts tied in Nathanson maintained his ""Market Perform"" rating on Netflix but raised his price target by +$30 to $220.

He performed as Erica Stevens singing Whitney Houston Grace Jones and Tina Turner for adoring fans eventually earning the title of Miss Gay Wisconsin in 1986 and 1987.

“I had this group of Black kids who came in because they were represented” Wynn now 58 said of his time at the club in the late 1980s and early ’90s. “I saw them and let them know I saw them because they finally had representation onstage.”

Among them were Eddie Smith who was known as “the Sheikh” because he often wore a head scarf and Anthony Hughes who was deaf. Hughes was “my absolute favorite fan” and blushed when Wynn winked at him from stage. In return Hughes taught him the ABCs of sign language.

That means you’ll be able to catch the movie in cinemas just about a month before it premieres on Netflix itself on December 23rd.

The film will be showing in about 600 theaters across the US including theaters from all three of the big US theatrical companies — AMC Regal and Cinemark. Internationally the film will be in theaters in countries including Canada the UK Ireland Italy Germany Spain Israel Australia and New Zealand Netflix says in a press release. Tickets go on sale October 10th at glassonionmovie.com.

In his spoiler-free review Andrew Webster said the movie “solidifies Knives Out as the next great mystery franchise.” I’m personally quite excited; I loved the first Knives Out and the cast for the sequel promises to be excellent with names like Edward Norton Dave Bautista Kathryn Hahn and Janelle Monáe on board. And this isn’t the only Knives Out sequel we can expect as Netflix also picked up the rights to a second in a blockbuster deal last year."

Wärtsilä did not specify which mine would be affected by the upgrade.

Wärtsilä will upgrade the facility's power output on each generating set by 8% as well as supporting its operational reliability and its availability during peak periods. It will also prevent de-rating which is an issue in the high-altitude dry Nevada desert.

Wärtsilä will install its UNIC engine control system with its all-inclusive automation system. This will minimise the likelihood of outages during the peak three-month long period in the summer season. The upgrade will increase efficiency and allow engines to operate less continuously which will lower carbon emissions.

The plant was originally installed in 2005 with a net output of 115.6 MW and operates with 14 Wärtsilä 34SG gas engines.

Wärtsilä will begin the upgrade in January 2023 to increase the output to 128 MW. The upgrade will be undertaken in phases to coincide with the plant's overhaul schedule to minimise impact on mine production.

""By increasing the load during the peak season we can increase our operational flexibility since at times we can have one engine on hot standby instead of running more engines on part load"" Regional Energy Manager for Nevada Gold Mines John Seeliger said.

""This will reduce carbon emissions while also generating some cost savings.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3c2doYW5hLmNvbS5naC9nb3Zlcm5tZW50LWFza2VkLXRvLWRldmVsb3AtY29tbW9uLXByaWNpbmctcmVnaW1lLWZvci1jZXJlYWxzL9IBV2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3c2doYW5hLmNvbS5naC9nb3Zlcm5tZW50LWFza2VkLXRvLWRldmVsb3AtY29tbW9uLXByaWNpbmctcmVnaW1lLWZvci1jZXJlYWxzLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Government asked to develop common pricing regime for cereals,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3c2doYW5hLmNvbS5naC9nb3Zlcm5tZW50LWFza2VkLXRvLWRldmVsb3AtY29tbW9uLXByaWNpbmctcmVnaW1lLWZvci1jZXJlYWxzL9IBV2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3c2doYW5hLmNvbS5naC9nb3Zlcm5tZW50LWFza2VkLXRvLWRldmVsb3AtY29tbW9uLXByaWNpbmctcmVnaW1lLWZvci1jZXJlYWxzLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC930CB20>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3c2doYW5hLmNvbS5naC9nb3Zlcm5tZW50LWFza2VkLXRvLWRldmVsb3AtY29tbW9uLXByaWNpbmctcmVnaW1lLWZvci1jZXJlYWxzL9IBV2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3c2doYW5hLmNvbS5naC9nb3Zlcm5tZW50LWFza2VkLXRvLWRldmVsb3AtY29tbW9uLXByaWNpbmctcmVnaW1lLWZvci1jZXJlYWxzLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,

The former CNN star’s premiere of his new show “Cuomo” on NewsNation pulled in just 147000 total viewers on Monday night according to figures released by Nielsen Media Research.

Cuomo — who as reported by The Post is being paid just $1 million a year by the fledgling network a fraction of his compensation at CNN — fared poorly in the 25-to-54-year-old age demographic most coveted by advertisers drawing just 8000 viewers.

CNBC Fox Business HLN and Newsmax all beat Cuomo in the 25-54 demographic according to Nielsen.

Cuomo’s viewership in the 25-54 demographic was smaller than the 7 p.m. hour that preceded his show on NewsNation.

Adding insult to injury for Cuomo was the fact that reruns of syndicated shows such as “Blue Bloods” on NewsNation as well as “Paw Patrol” “SpongeBob” “Seinfeld” “Cocomelon” “The Office” and “Bobs Burgers” all drew more total viewers and in the 25-54 demographic.

3 Chris Cuomo’s debut as host of a primetime talk show on cable news outlet NewsNation was a flop according to Nielsen figures.

Fox News’ Tucker Carlson maintained his dominance in cable news drawing nearly 2.9 million viewers — more than 20 times the audience generated by Cuomo — on Monday as well as 445000 in the 25-54 demo.

Tap the right side of the screen below to watch this web story:

Chris Hayes the host of “All In” on MSNBC was a distant second. His viewership on Monday reached just north of 1.4 million — including 130000 in the 25-54 demographic.

3 The premiere episode of “Cuomo” managed just 147000 total viewers on Monday according to Nielsen.

Cuomo’s former network colleague CNN’s Anderson Cooper lagged behind in third place pulling in 814000 total viewers and 184000 in the 25-54 demo according to Nielsen.

Eric Bolling the former Fox News anchor who now hosts “The Balance” on cable news upstart Newsmax topped Cuomo drawing 151000 total viewers. Of those 16000 viewers were from the coveted 25-54 demographic.

The Post has reached out to NewsNation’s parent company Nexstar Media Group seeking comment.

Fox News is a subsidiary of Fox Corporation which is the sister company of The Post’s corporate parent News Corp.

Cuomo’s return to primetime cable television came after a nearly year-long hiatus prompted by his firing by CNN.

The onetime host of “Cuomo Prime Time” was ousted by then-boss Jeff Zucker after it was learned that he helped his brother former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo combat sexual harassment allegations.

The 52-year-old NewsNation anchor told his viewers on Monday that he “learned lessons” from his CNN exit.

Cuomo has pledged to be neutral and less partisan in his commentary.

“We are manipulated by manufactured division that only works to advance the interests of the fringe and the fake. It is only online and how that can be echoed on TV that distorts the reality” Cuomo said on Monday night.

“The majority is not about left or right you’re about reasonable. That’s why I’m going to rely not on reading tweets to measure your feedback I want to go old school here” he said while reading a phone number that viewers could call to interact with the anchor.

“It will be a time for us to discuss our society as adults in the room not some raging radicals or somebody with keyboard muscles” Cuomo said.

""Made in America is no longer a slogan"" Biden said in a speech at Poughkeepsie's IBM facility cheering a boom in domestic private-sector investments under his administration. ""It's a reality.""

""Since we've been elected we've created 678000 new manufacturing jobs and we're just getting started"" Biden pledged.

What You Need To Know President Joe Biden traveled to Poughkeepsie New York on Thursday to cheer IBM’s $20 billion investment in the Hudson Valley region over the next decade which will cover research development and manufacturing of semiconductors quantum computing and artificial intelligence





The IBM announcement is the latest in a series of private sector investments since the president signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law a bill aimed at bolstering competitiveness with China that contains more than $52 billion in chip manufacturing and research





Biden highlighted the importance of semiconductor manufacturing in the United States not only for job creation but for making the U.S. economy independent of other nations pledging: ""The supply chain is going to start here and end here in the United States""





Thursday’s event follows Tuesday’s announcement that Micron will invest up to $100 billion over the next 20 years to build a chip manufacturing facility in Clay a suburb of Syracuse New York which Biden said will ""create 50000 jobs and create create an increase in America share the memory chips increase it by 500%""



Biden toured IBM's Poughkeepsie facility before delivering remarks about what the White House calls a nationwide “manufacturing boom” spurred by his economic plan which includes a bipartisan $280 billion semiconductor and scientific research bill passed earlier this summer.

""It's here at this factory and the factories of other companies across America where America's future is literally being built because of the groundbreaking CHIPS and Science Act that I signed into law"" the president said.

“It was here in Poughkeepsie where the rifles for World War I were made"" Biden said. ""The first electric typewriters calculators even cough drops. were made. And it is here now where the Hudson Valley could become an epicenter of the future of quantum computing.”

IBM’s Poughkeepsie facility is the company's only site that builds mainframe systems and is home to its first Quantum Computation Center. The company aims to make the a global hub for the company’s quantum computing development IBM said in a release.

The president said that quantum computing ""has the potential to transform everything from how we create new medicines to how we power artificial intelligence"" and highlighted the importance of semiconductor manufacturing in the United States not only for job creation but for making the U.S. economy independent of other nations.

""As we saw during the pandemic when factories when factories that make these chips shut down around the world the global economy literally comes to a screeching halt"" Biden said. ""More Americans learned the phrase 'supply chain' and what it means. Well guess what? The supply chain is going to start here and end here in the United States.""

Biden blamed the shortage of chips as a major driver of inflation citing higher prices of cars which require semiconductors.

""Folks we need to make these chips here in America to bring down everyday costs and create good-paying American jobs"" the president said. ""Don't take my word for it. Listen to the leaders of IBM and across the country. They're making decisions right now about where to invest and produce these chips. And they're choosing America because they see we're coming back we're leading the way.""

""This is about economic security folks"" Biden said. ""It's about national security. It's about good-paying jobs you can raise a family on. Jobs now jobs for the Future. Jobs in every part of our country and that's what we're going to see here in this factory in the beautiful Hudson Valley. People of all ages all races all backgrounds with advanced degrees to no degrees working side-by-side doing the most sophisticated manufacturing the world has ever seen.""

Biden toured the facility with Gov. Kathy Hochul and Democratic Reps. Sean Patrick Maloney Paul Tonko and Pat Ryan House incumbents in competitive races in the region. Dutchess County Executive Marc Molinaro a Republican who lost to Rep. Ryan in a special election for New York's 19th Congressional District in August was in attendance for the event as well. Molinaro is running again in November against Democrat Josh Riley in a newly redrawn 19th District.

""I’m more optimistic about America’s chances today than I have been in my entire career"" Biden said as he toured the facility.

Speaking ahead of the president IBM chairman and CEO Arvind Krishna said that IBM's Poughkeepsie facility is ""of deep symbolic value"" for the company and the country ""for good reason"" noting that ""for decades the innovations we have done here ... have helped keep the United States at the forefront of technological leadership created countless jobs and strengthened our economy.""

Krishna praised the CHIPS and Science Act thanking Biden and Schumer and the members of Congress ""who worked tirelessly to make this unique investment in America's semiconductor industry.""

""This law will play a critical role in ensuring the reliable and secure supply of chips"" he said. ""It will also help advance the business of quantum computing. With the CHIPS and Science Act the federal government has made an important investment in America's future.""

The IBM announcement is the latest in a series of private sector investments since the president signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law a bill aimed at bolstering competitiveness with China that contains more than $52 billion in chip manufacturing and research. The bill a major priority of the Biden administration and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer D-N.Y. won significant bipartisan support in Congress.

Thursday’s event follows Tuesday’s announcement that Micron will invest up to $100 billion over the next 20 years to build a chip manufacturing facility in Clay a suburb of Syracuse New York. Biden said Thursday that that Micron's investment ""create 50000 jobs and create create an increase in America share the memory chips increase it by 500%.""

""That would be the largest American ivestment of its kind ever ever ever ever"" Biden said Thursday.

Biden in a statement at the time called the Micron announcement “another win for America” crediting his economic plan which includes the CHIPS and Science Act. Micron CEO Sanjay Mehotra speaking at an event earlier this week agreed.

“There is no doubt that without the CHIPS Act we would not be here today” Mehotra said Tuesday adding: “The combined efforts at the federal state and local level paved the way for Micron to realize the largest private investment ever made in New York state history.”

Micron also recently announced a major factory project in Idaho another in a string of recent domestic investments from technology companies. Chip giant Intel recently broke ground last month on two facilities near Columbus Ohio a $20 billion investment and Samsung announced a $17 billion plant in Texas late last year in addition to invetments from other companies.

Later Thursday Biden will travel to New Jersey for a Democratic National Committee fundraiser at the home of Gov. Phil Murphy who chairs the Democratic Governors Association.

Cuomo — who as reported by The Post is being paid just $1 million a year by the fledgling network a fraction of his compensation at CNN — fared poorly in the 25-to-54-year-old age demographic most coveted by advertisers drawing just 8000 viewers.

CNBC Fox Business HLN and Newsmax all beat Cuomo in the 25-54 demographic according to Nielsen.

Cuomo’s viewership in the 25-54 demographic was smaller than the 7 p.m. hour that preceded his show on NewsNation.

Adding insult to injury for Cuomo was the fact that reruns of syndicated shows such as “Blue Bloods” on NewsNation as well as “Paw Patrol” “SpongeBob” “Seinfeld” “Cocomelon” “The Office” and “Bobs Burgers” all drew more total viewers and in the 25-54 demographic.

3 Chris Cuomo’s debut as host of a primetime talk show on cable news outlet NewsNation was a flop according to Nielsen figures.

Fox News’ Tucker Carlson maintained his dominance in cable news drawing nearly 2.9 million viewers — more than 20 times the audience generated by Cuomo — on Monday as well as 445000 in the 25-54 demo.

Chris Hayes the host of “All In” on MSNBC was a distant second. His viewership on Monday reached just north of 1.4 million — including 130000 in the 25-54 demographic.

3 The premiere episode of “Cuomo” managed just 147000 total viewers on Monday according to Nielsen.

Cuomo’s former network colleague CNN’s Anderson Cooper lagged behind in third place pulling in 814000 total viewers and 184000 in the 25-54 demo according to Nielsen.

Eric Bolling the former Fox News anchor who now hosts “The Balance” on cable news upstart Newsmax topped Cuomo drawing 151000 total viewers. Of those 16000 viewers were from the coveted 25-54 demographic.

The Post has reached out to NewsNation’s parent company Nexstar Media Group seeking comment.

Fox News is a subsidiary of Fox Corporation which is the sister company of The Post’s corporate parent News Corp.

Cuomo’s return to primetime cable television came after a nearly year-long hiatus prompted by his firing by CNN.

The onetime host of “Cuomo Prime Time” was ousted by then-boss Jeff Zucker after it was learned that he helped his brother former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo combat sexual harassment allegations.

The 52-year-old NewsNation anchor told his viewers on Monday that he “learned lessons” from his CNN exit.

Cuomo has pledged to be neutral and less partisan in his commentary.

“We are manipulated by manufactured division that only works to advance the interests of the fringe and the fake. It is only online and how that can be echoed on TV that distorts the reality” Cuomo said on Monday night.

“The majority is not about left or right you’re about reasonable. That’s why I’m going to rely not on reading tweets to measure your feedback I want to go old school here” he said while reading a phone number that viewers could call to interact with the anchor.

“It will be a time for us to discuss our society as adults in the room not some raging radicals or somebody with keyboard muscles” Cuomo said.

This would be illegal in Australia now that we’re through pandemic restrictions and companies are required to offer a physical component to their annual gatherings with shareholders.

While most transparent ASX-listed companies now release their remuneration details in August along with the full year results News Corp still waits for as long as possible to reveal who was paid what via its proxy statement.

Rupert Murdoch 91 is not becoming any less money-focused as he ages. He pocketed US$6.47 million (A$9.94 million) as News Corp’s “executive chairman” in 2021-22 despite not attending any of the four earnings calls with analysts held during the year.

The world’s longest-serving public company director continues to be paid as “executive chairman” of the completely unrelated company Fox Corp where he received $US15.4 million (A$23.66 million) in 2021-22.

All up Murdoch men have now been paid more than $1.5 billion by public companies they control since 2000 although at least the total figure of $US46 million in 2021-22 was a 10-year low and well below the $US65.84 million they pocketed in 2020-21.

If only the Murdochs were like the Packer family and agreed to work for free as public company directors instead limiting themselves to enjoying the benefits of dividends and share price appreciation delivered by their excellent management."

The project gives us a glimpse into the future as the US shifts from fossil fuels to clean energy sources.

The Wheatridge Renewable Energy Facility is the first utility-scale development in North America to implement wind and solar generation with battery storage.

Until the Inflation Reduction Act was passed in August energy storage projects were only eligible for tax incentives if they were exclusively based on solar energy. However the IRA bill opens up new possibilities by providing incentives for mixed (wind and solar) and standalone battery storage projects.

As a result more projects like the Wheatridge Renewable Energy Facility will likely be in the works. The combination of wind and solar energy can improve reliability adding value to the grid.

The renewable energy plant is made possible through a partnership between NextEra Energy Resources and Portland General Electric. NextEra purchased the development rights to a wind farm and expanded upon it with the help of PGE adding solar capability and battery storage.

Rebecca Kujawa CEO of Nextera Energy talks about the benefits of combining renewable energy sources stating:

Bringing wind solar and energy storage together at one site is quite a significant moment for renewable technologies.

Kujawa adds:

These facilities generate low-cost homegrown energy and will provide millions of dollars in additional tax revenue to Morrow County over the life of the project.

The facility opened last week in Morrow County Oregon and is the first of its scale according to the companies.

Details of the solar wind and battery storage project in Oregon

The Wheatridge Renewable Energy Project is an example of how combining renewable energy sources (solar and wind) with battery storage can help provide reliable sustainable energy as utility companies look to cut back on carbon emissions.

The renewable energy plant includes:

300 MW wind capacity via 120 GE turbines

A 50 MW photovoltaic solar energy generating facility

A 30 MW battery storage facility

Using power generated from wind and solar the battery storage system will save unused energy providing it for use at any time.

Morrow County Commissioner Don Russel says:

We’re pleased to have Wheatridge Renewable Energy Facilities located in Morrow County and to play a part in providing clean energy to Oregonians. This facility provides jobs and tax revenue for our schools and county services while also supporting economic opportunities for the agricultural community. Wheatridge Renewable Energy Facilities also strengthens Morrow County’s position in the region’s clean energy economy.

The renewable energy facility created about 300 jobs during construction and employs around 10 full-time employees.

Electrek’s Take

With new incentives to start battery storage projects the Wheatridge Renewable Energy Facility is hopefully the first of many of its kind from a utility company.

Combining wind and solar with battery storage offers advantages over using either system individually. Hybrid systems like these can generate energy essentially at any point. When the sun is shining it can generate power from solar and when the sun is not as intense in winter months it can generate energy from the wind and store it for later use.

The combination of technology is what will provide the most value over time. To hit the US’s goal of a 100% carbon pollution-free electricity sector by 2035 more will need to be done and this is exactly the type of project that can help us get there.

Renewable energy is being deployed around the globe. A new report shows renewable energy sources were used to meet the rise in global electricity demand in the first half of 2022. If hybrid systems like Wheatridge can be utilized it can help speed up the transition to clean energy while building a reliable grid for the future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlY2xpbWF0ZW5ld3Mub3JnL25ld3MvMDYxMDIwMjIvYS1jbGVhbi1lbmVyZ3ktdHJpZmVjdGEtd2luZC1zb2xhci1hbmQtc3RvcmFnZS1pbi10aGUtc2FtZS1wcm9qZWN0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Clean Energy Trifecta: Wind Solar and Storage in the Same Project,"Elected officials and energy company executives gathered last week in rural Oregon to mark the completion of Wheatridge Renewable Energy Facility a project that combines a wind farm solar array and battery storage.

This is the fourth and the largest project in the United States to combine those three renewable energy resources on the same site.

Energy companies call this combination a “hybrid” power plant an increasingly popular approach to development in which companies see the opportunity to save money and provide steadier electricity output by building different renewable resources next to each other.

To understand the significance of the Wheatridge project I reached out to Mark Bolinger of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory co-author of a series of reports about hybrid renewables the most recent of which came out in August.

“Most of these hybrid plants are solar and storage only” Bolinger said. “What makes (Wheatridge) special is that it includes a wind element as well.”

Wheatridge was built by NextEra Energy Resources for use by the utility Portland General Electric. It includes a 200-megawatt wind farm a 50-megawatt solar array and a 30-megawatt battery; the battery has a duration of four hours. The three components together can provide for the electricity needs of about 100000 houses.

Bolinger and his colleagues have tallied 140 projects in the United States that combine solar and storage; 14 projects that combine wind and storage; nine projects that combine solar and wind; and three in addition to Wheatridge with wind solar and storage. (The other three with the wind-solar-storage trifecta are the Grand Ridge project in Illinois Northwest Ohio Wind in Ohio and Jersey-Atlantic Wind Farm in New Jersey.)

The report notes that a majority of the new storage capacity that went online in the United States in 2021 was part of a solar-storage hybrid. So this approach to building battery storage alongside renewables has gone in a few years from a novelty to commonplace.

Wind and solar work well together with wind usually strongest at night and solar—of course—strongest during the day. Batteries can kick in to discharge electricity at low points for the other two and at times of high consumer demand.

But the complementary nature of the three resources is true whether they are on the same site or miles away from each other on the same regional grid.

So why build hybrid renewable projects? Bolinger described several benefits:

Savings on development and operational costs: It’s less complicated for a company to obtain leases for one big piece of land in one jurisdiction than to do so in several different places. Also the various components can share the same interconnection point to the grid which reduces costs. Once a project is built it takes fewer employees to provide maintenance if all the parts are next to each other.

The ease of only needing one grid connection: Developers often face long waits to get approval to connect new projects to the grid for a variety of technical and bureaucratic reasons. It helps that a hybrid project can have two or three components that only need to apply for one grid connection.

Batteries paired with renewables can help in congested grid regions: Some parts of the grid don’t have enough power line capacity at certain times of day to deliver all of the solar and wind power being generated. With nowhere to go some wind and solar gets curtailed which means it temporarily shuts down. If a project has batteries on site it can store the excess wind and solar for later use.

Until the August passage of the Inflation Reduction Act there was another reason which was that storage projects were eligible for the federal investment tax credit if they were paired with renewables but storage projects weren’t eligible on their own. The credit was worth up to 30 percent of the cost of a project.

The new federal law allows storage projects to qualify for the tax credit even if not paired with other resources.

The changes in tax incentives could lead developers to do more free-standing storage projects instead of hybrids. Bolinger said he’s eager to see if the ongoing benefits of hybrids are enough to continue to fuel growth.

Wheatridge is located in northeast Oregon’s Morrow County a flat and rural area.

The project will help Oregon comply with a 2021 state law that says major utilities must reduce emissions from generating electricity by 100 percent by 2040 with interim goals between now and then.

“I firmly believe we can move to 100 percent clean electricity sources and create good-paying jobs in rural Oregon at the same time” said Gov. Kate Brown in a statement. “The urgency of getting clean energy projects online could not be clearer. Extreme heat wildfires drought and winter storms—we are seeing the impacts of climate change in Oregon with some of the biggest impacts in rural Oregon.”

Like renewable energy plants in general hybrid plants are getting bigger.

Another big one is the Skeleton Creek project in Oklahoma which is scheduled to go online early next year with 250 megawatts of wind 250 megawatts of solar and a 200 megawatt battery storage system. Like Wheatbridge it’s being developed by NextEra.

So Wheatbridge now has the crown as the largest wind-solar-storage hybrid in the country based on combined capacity but only for a few more months.

Other stories about the energy transition to take note of this week:

EVs Add to Electricity Demand But Not as Much as You Might Think: During a recent power shortage California officials asked consumers not to charge their electric vehicles at certain times a request that led to comments about the folly of switching the entire vehicle fleet to EVs. But the actual electricity demand for EVs now and in the near future is pretty manageable as Colin McKerracher writes for Bloomberg. “Integrating EVs into the power system will still require careful planning incentives for off-peak charging to reduce peak demand and localized grid reinforcement in many places” he wrote. “As a share of global electricity demand though the contribution will still be very modest for quite a few years.”

This 100 Percent Solar Community Endured Hurricane Ian with No Loss of Power and Minimal Damage: Babcock Ranch Florida calls itself “America’s first solar-powered town” with much of its electricity coming from a nearby solar array. Many residents also have rooftop solar and battery storage. Those systems turned out to be resilient in the face of Hurricane Ian with the lights staying on at the same time that the storm destroyed parts of the nearby Fort Myers and Naples areas and knocked out power to millions of customers as Rachel Ramirez reports for CNN. “We have proof of the case now because (the hurricane) came right over us” Nancy Chorpenning a 68-year-old Babcock Ranch resident told CNN. “We have water electricity internet—and we may be the only people in Southwest Florida who are that fortunate.”

Tesla Shares Drop After Third-Quarter Sales Report: Tesla said this week that it increased its deliveries of new vehicles in the third quarter compared to the prior-year quarter but the growth fell short of analysts’ expectations leading to a selloff of the company’s shares. Tesla faced growing pains at its new factories in Germany and Texas executive turnover and soaring commodity prices as Lora Kolodny reports for CNBC. The falling share price is a sign that investors were worried by the results but Wall Street analysts were divided about the company’s prospects going forward.

Want a Career Saving the Planet? Become an Electrician: Installing the solar panels heat pumps and transmission lines is going to require a lot of electricians. But the industry is facing a shortage as Shannon Osaka reports for The Washington Post. Part of the issue is that more people are leaving the profession than entering it. “Over the last 20 years there has been very negative messaging to millennials and Gen Z about the trades” Sam Steyer the president and CEO of Greenwork a start-up that connects clean energy workers with companies. “There were a lot of articles saying ‘All blue collar jobs are going to go away everyone is going to be a knowledge worker or a care worker.’”

Rural Officials Face Intense Pressure Oppose Solar Power Development: In Pickaway County Ohio a committed group of opponents of solar power have dominated the local debate over proposed projects by packing county village and township meetings and making their displeasure known if officials don’t fall into line. This is the third part of my series for ICN about rural resistance to renewable energy. It shows how solar opponents have persuaded local officials to join in the opposition to the frustration of residents who support the projects.

Wind farms in Wyoming have faced high-profile fines for killing eagles. In April NextEra Energy pleaded guilty to violating the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and was ordered to pay more than $8 million. Duke Energy which operates a few wind farms in Wyoming was fined $1 million in 2014 for the deaths of 14 golden eagles; and PacifiCorp received $2.5 million in fines for 38 eagles killed by its turbines.

The way the federal agency now handles the permitting of eagle kills called “takes” is the service reviews applications for eagle take permits. If the agency issues a permit it will include conditions specific to that project.

The proposed changes would create a faster alternative route to permitting of activities that have low impacts for eagles and well-established measures to minimize impacts by allowing authorization without site-specific analysis.

Finishing Eagles Off

Erik Molvar executive director of the Western Watersheds Project said that because of the eagle population in southern Wyoming which is where most Cowboy State wind projects are sited most Wyoming wind farms wouldn’t be eligible for the alternative permitting route — with one caveat.

“One of the unintended consequences of this general permitting process is once the existing projects take down golden eagle numbers to the point where they’re below the thresholds then general permits can be issued to finish them off” Molvar said.

Molvar said the proposed changes would “be a step forward” for permitting electrical transmission lines. The general permit requires that lines be constructed in a way that prevents eagle electrocutions and has a mechanism for retrofitting existing power lines where wires are close together and electrocutions are more frequent.

He also noted that it might incentivize wind companies to site their projects outside areas of high eagle density.

Molvar called southern Wyoming one of the last eagle strongholds and the wildlife service has said there’s no acceptable number higher than zero for golden eagle losses.

“We can’t afford to lose any more of these golden eagles even as it is and yet the wind farms keep going up” Molvar said.

Molvar said siting solar projects in urban areas would require less transmission and not kill eagles.

Learning Curve

Susan Ahalt founder of Ironside Bird Rescue said wind companies are doing a lot to mitigate impacts to eagle populations.

“They’re really conscientious about trying to save the birds” Ahalt said.

Ironside is in Cody where there are few wind farms or eagles but Ahalt said there’s little chance eagles colliding with turbine blades survive.

“I’ve never received a bird that was hit by a turbine” she said. “Although I’m sure if they’re hit they’re dead.”

The bird rescuer said that there’s a learning curve with everything and wind energy companies are gradually learning ways to mitigate the impacts.

Duke Energy’s IdentiFlight bird detection technology is one example she said. The system which is installed at the company’s Top of the World wind farm in Converse County identifies birds near wind blades calculates their flight path and can stop the wind turbines to prevent a collision. A study published in the Journal of Applied Ecology found that eagle deaths decreased 85% at Top of the World after the system was installed.

“The system uses AI [artificial intelligence] and therefore gets smarter the more images it collects. Additionally the technology has improved since the study was conducted” said Shelley Vierra marketing a business development for Boulder Imaging and IdentiFlight.

David Eskelsen spokesperson for PacifiCorp said the company also is incorporating the technology into its wind projects and will shut down individual turbines as needed.

Before the company sites a wind project Eskelsen said it collects a large amount of data on avian wildlife in the wind farm location as well as other wildlife. Species behavior can change over time so after the wind farm is operating they have staff of wildlife biologists that help manage wildlife impacts.

“One of the things particularly with the raptors is they move according to prey species” Eskelsen said. “So we have to be cognizant of those natural tendencies. So an area that may not be active in one season.”

Key Responsibility

According to the Sierra Club about one million birds are killed by wind turbines every year but the organization notes that transmission lines windows communication towers and cats kill far more.

Once endangered the populations of bald eagles have increased four-fold since 2009. There are now about 350000 of the birds in the U.S. populations of bald eagles. On the other hand there are about 40000 golden eagles in the U.S. and the species requires a much larger area to survive.

The service said the proposed changes to eagle take permitting won’t undermine its commitment to conservation of the species.

“Preservation of bald and golden eagles is a key responsibility for the service” said U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director Martha Williams in a press release about the proposed changes.

Its origins began on the basketball court back in 1982 but quickly became a staple in global hip-hop culture. As the celebratory year continues Nike has prepared several festive releases to honor the iconic silhouette. The latest release to join the line-up is the Nike Air Force 1 Low “Bronx Origins” which pays tribute to the borough’s musical legacy.

Soaked in historical notions the upper is constructed from tumbled white leather featuring distinctive black medial Swooshes with a scored finish. Gilded lace dubraes see embossed detailing promoting the years “1973” and “1982” the latter signifying the model’s debut. Rear pull-tabs don illustrative branding while tongue tags see “Anniversary Edition” text in sophisticated cursive lettering. Graphic insoles are printed with a spinning “Bronx Origins” vinyl record completing the design with white midsoles and milky semi-translucent bottoms that allow the same phrase to peek through.

The Nike Air Force 1 Low “Bronx Origins” is set to hit shelves on October 14 via Nike and select retailers for $150 USD.

The $425 million investment is expected to create more than 50 new full-time jobs. It will also support the company's strategy to expand its capabilities and increase participation in the automotive and consumer durables markets. The start-up of the galvanizing line is expected in mid-2025.



The company’s board also approved a galvanizing line to be built in the western United States. It plans to announce the details at a future date. These investments are in sync with the company’s strategy of shifting its mix to higher margin value-added products.



Nucor which is a prominent player in the steel space along with Steel Dynamics Inc. STLD United States Steel Corporation X and ArcelorMittal S.A. MT said that the new galvanizing line in South Carolina will have an annual capacity of roughly 500000 tons. It will be able to produce galvanized steel up to 72 inches wide.



The company last month announced that it will invest $200 million over a five-year period in mill modernization projects at its Nucor Steel Berkeley division in South Carolina. The investment will include the construction of a new air separation unit for supplying industrial gases for the mill's steelmaking operations.



Nucor operates five strategically located sheet mills that uses thin slab casters to make flat-rolled steel for automotive appliance construction pipe and tube and other industrial and consumer applications. The current capacity of its sheet mills is estimated at around 13 million tons annually. A sixth sheet mill is currently under construction in West Virginia. The company also has majority stake in California Steel Industries as well as a joint venture automotive galvanizing line in Mexico.



Nucor recently issued its guidance for the third quarter of 2022. It projects third-quarter earnings to be between $6.30 and $6.40 per share. This suggests a decline from $9.67 per share in second-quarter 2022 and $7.28 per share in the year-ago quarter.



The company expects earnings to decline significantly in the steel mills segment on a sequential comparison basis in the third quarter. The expected decline is due to metal margin contraction and lower shipment volumes especially at its sheet and plate mills.



Nucor expects its steel products segment to deliver another strong quarter with earnings roughly in-line with second-quarter 2022. Earnings for the raw materials unit are forecast to be flat on a sequential comparison basis in the third quarter. The company continues to believe that 2022 will be the most profitable year in its history.

The site determined the rankings based on feedback provided by employees over the past year.

“Beyond competitive pay having great perks and benefits continue to play an important role in what makes a workplace attractive” Jason Nazar co-founder and chief executive officer of Comparably said in a statement. “From fully-paid healthcare and unlimited time off to fertility and adoption benefits more companies are expanding their offerings to make a difference in the lives of their employees.”

The list includes the 100 top-rated large companies with more than 500 employees and the 100 top-rated small and midsize companies with fewer than 500 employees.

Employees anonymously rated their companies on Comparably.com between Sept. 14 2021 and Sept. 14 2022. They were asked questions like “Are you satisfied with your benefits?” and “How would you rate the perks your office provides?”

""Benefits at Microsoft are best in class"" one anonymous employee said of the tech giant which grabbed the number one spot among large companies. ""The medical coverage and fitness expense money are extremely generous.""

Below are the top 50 large and top 50 small and midsize companies that made the list.

Making salaries public:More employers are sharing how much jobs pay. Will it close the wage gap?

Tech layoffs:Snapchat big tech layoffs making you anxious about your job? Don't panic. What to know.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition Graphics Cards Unboxing Plus First Impressions

NVIDIA sent several press outlets including us their Founders Edition of the GeForce RTX 4090 GPU (or BFGPU as they like to call it). The Founders Edition graphics cards will exist alongside the huge lineup of custom models which we also have prepped and ready for our review. But today we can only provide you with our unboxing and first look at these cards.

2 of 9

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition is an absolute mammoth of a design. It is heavier and also features several optimizations to the heatsink that allow the Ada Lovelace GPUs sitting in it to run cool and quiet.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 ""Ada Lovelace"" Founders Edition Graphics Card Unboxing

So let's get started by unboxing this behemoth of a graphics card and start by taking a look at the packing first.

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition comes within a large box that weighs around 6Kg and has a rectangular shape. The whole box features a matte black color with the NVIDIA logo on the top left corner and the GeForce RTX 4090 logo below it.

If you flip the box vertically you will see that it resembles an Xbox Series X console and it is also the same height. The side features an outline of the Founders Edition cooler.

The box will come as a standard with all NVIDIA RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16 GB Founders Edition cards.

The top and bottom of the box are two separate compartments. The top opens up and the end result looks like a rectangle.

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition graphics card rests at the center of the packaging & you can see the creative take from NVIDIA in designing this package.

Once the box is open you finally get to lay your eyes on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 graphics card which looks as spectacular as ever.

The card may look like it is the same design as the RTX 3090 Ti Founders Edition but it is a slightly updated version which we will explain in a bit.

A cover that exposes a lid sits underneath the card and can be easily pulled to reveal another package.

This package contains a few manuals and also one of the most important accessories that NVIDIA ships with its Founders Edition card.

if you guessed the 16-pin (12VHPWR) connector then you guessed right. This is an NVIDIA-branded adapter and comes with a single 16-pin to four 8-pin connectors. This is rated to provide up to 600 Watts of power to the chip.

Following is what the 16-pin connector looks like. You may have already seen and heard about it in several articles from us but you can note that there are 12 standard pins and four smaller pins on the connector.

Out of the box we can finally start taking a much better look at the Ada Lovelace powerhouse/

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 ""Ada Lovelace"" Founders Edition Graphics Card Close Up

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition is a true BFGPU. A big chunky card that will take a good amount of room within your PC.

The card comes in a triple-slot design and you can see the several exhaust vents that are there to push air out of the chassis.

On the bottom of the shroud you can see three plastic panels that cover the main heatsink and the largest one features the ""RTX 4090"" branding on it.

The back of the card is encircled by the large die-cast aluminum piece forming an ""X"" shape in the center.

The card features a dual-axial flow-through design. This design incorporates two fans placed on different sides of the shroud (one front and one back) and perpendicular to one another.

The fan at the bottom pushes air out of the aluminum fins on the backplate.

As you can see the card is super thick in terms of design and all of this thickness is there to hold the massive aluminum fins and heat pipes that run through the shroud.

You can find a nice ""GeForce RTX"" logo on the card which features LEDs. A similar LED can also be found within the shroud on the back.

The card comes with a single 16-pin power connector that uses the aforementioned 12VHPWR plug that's bundled with the card.

The new Founders Edition cooler comes with 10% larger fan sizes and 10% larger fin volume. This is all to help the card running super cool and also super quiet.

Once again you can lay your eyes on the RTX 4090 logo which comes with a new font style. This will be applicable across all RTX 40 series cards.

NVIDIA has taken away some of that aluminum frame room and cut out the corners to make space for the larger fans.

The front side of the card is an aluminum heatsink. These large heatsink block show that there's some serious cooling involved to keep the card running.

There's a nice little ""RTX 4090"" logo carved out on one of the four aluminum arms on the front of the shroud.

Lastly we can just tell you that the card feels very premium and very awesome when running on the PC. We can't talk about any temps noise power or performance figures at the moment but be assured that those will be coming in real soon too.

We also want to give you a small taste of the few custom models that we have with us right now. We will have at least four custom models ready for review day but enjoy these two for now:
