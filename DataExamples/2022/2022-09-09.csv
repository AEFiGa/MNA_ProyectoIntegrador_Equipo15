Bill and Jen Wintermyer | September 10 2022

Hershey Trojan’s visited Dallastown at Wildcats stadium. This game had all the makings to be a great game and it did not disappoint. These teams were evenly matched and the game was ultimately decided by turnovers.

Dallastown received the 1st half kickoff and started off at their own 25-yard line. They marched down the field rushing the ball 7 times with 2 passes and scored at 7:42 of the 1st quarter. Not to be outdone Hershey started their drive at the 50-yard line after a fantastic kickoff return. They matched Dallastown’s opening drive rushing the ball 7 times and passing twice scoring on a 7-yard run at 5:43 in the 1st quarter.

Dallastown put together a clock eating drive rushing 9 times and passing twice caped off by a 5-yard rushing touchdown 11:56 in the 2nd quarter. Hershey tried countering on their second possession but stalled and punted. However the game got interesting on their next possession with a Daniel Painter pass to Marcus Sweeney for a 66-yard catch and run which was capped off one play later by a Chase Brooks 2-yard run at 3:04 of 2nd quarter. Dallastown went back to work on a quick 5 play drive helped by a William Logan 55-yard toss finished off by an 11-yard run at 1:28 of the 2nd quarter. Dallastown was up at the halftime break.

The second half is where the Trojan’s play got sloppy and probably cost them the game. In their first possession Hershey worked a 6-play drive but a snap went over Daniel Painter’s head and was recovered by Dallastown on Hershey’s 22-yard line. Four plays later Dallastown capitalized and scored at 8:13 of the 3rd quarter. Hershey then went 3 and out. Dallastown was running on all eight cylinders with another long 11-play drive and scored again at 5:22 of the 4th quarter. Dallastown 44 Derry Township 22. With the game out of reach Hershey showed grit on their final possession. They used 7-plays aided by a 32-yard run by Chase Brooks to the 8-yard line and finished off with an 8-yard touchdown pass and 2-point conversion. Final score Dallastown 44 Derry Township 30.

Dallastown – 193 rushing yards 176 passing yards for 369 total yards.

Hershey – 183 rushing yards 158 passing yards for 341 total yards. One muffed punt 3 lost fumbles and 1 interception.

However above the Woodford many attractive oil and gas reservoirs have been pursued with vertical technology over the past 100 years. As one of the deepest basins in the United States with horizontal Woodford wells routinely drilled between 14000 to 17000 FT TVD there is a lot of rock above the source in which hydrocarbons have accumulated.

Lynx Oklahoma Operating is focused on developing targets for horizontal drilling within and adjacent to existing legacy fields in the Anadarko Basin specifically Caddo County Oklahoma. After analyzing multiple targets in Caddo County including the deep Woodford Meramec Springer Red Fork and multiple Hoxbar reservoirs Lynx decided to initiate its horizontal program targeting crude oil in the Hoxbar Marchand. The Hoxbar Marchand is a sandstone oil reservoir with a typical gravity of 42 to 48 degrees API at 9500 FT to 10500 FT TVD historically developed utilizing conventional vertical technology since the mid-1960s.

Legacy vertical Hoxbar Marchand wells vary in performance. Many are marginal vertical producers and vertical wells drilled but never completed for various reasons including reservoir properties deemed commercially unproductive commodity prices and operator challenges. Lynx’s Chief Executive Officer Nelson Bolen states “These variables provide an attractive dynamic when analyzing conventional reservoirs for modern horizontal unconventional development as the vertical penetrations provide a detailed subsurface database showcase producibility but leave most of the oil behind.” Although vertical Hoxbar Marchand development was in thicker clean sandstones and thinner dirtier sandstones prospects in the thinner dirtier rock were often not developed beyond the first few wells. This provides an opportunity to add value utilizing modern unconventional technology on legacy conventional rock.

According to Al Warner senior vice president of geology “Lynx’s geological approach was to first construct a series of detailed cross sections wherein individual sandstone benches generally 5’ to 25’ but in some instances up to 50’ were correlated. These individual benches were then mapped over their entire extent providing targets that in many cases extend beyond the known limits of a given field or play. In a number of instances this detailed ‘splitting’ of the sandstones included mapping and extending the shalier sandstones over broader areas which have proven commercially productive.”

When targeting sandstones like the Hoxbar Marchand the gamma ray log is not the gospel when identifying productive or nonproductive rock. Other factors must be considered during drilling to stay in the optimum interval. Hydrocarbon shows both gas and oil provide excellent evidence of potentially productive rock but are not always easily identified especially when drilling with weighted oil-based mud. Rate of penetration is another excellent leading indicator that is utilized during geosteering and for target changes.

Targeting the best rock is critical for success with a focus on staying in the clean sandstone and shaley sandstone intervals. Lynx has seen equally good shows in both of these sandstones and selected black organic high gamma ray shales within the Hoxbar. The Woodford has been interpreted as the primary source for hydrocarbons within the Pennsylvanian reservoirs including the Marchand but the black shales may not only be a secondary source but could also contribute to production particularly if they are in close association with the sandstones; thus providing additional upside. Lynx has not drilled a pure Hoxbar Shale well but it could provide significant upside in the future. Lynx’s current focus continues to be the Hoxbar Marchand Sandstone interval.

By optimizing drilling practices the mud system and BHA Lynx successfully eliminated the intermediate 7” casing commonly run in this area. This allowed Lynx to utilize a monobore design 5.5” casing from surface to TD enabling fracturing rates at 100 BPM under 10000 psi treating pressure further reducing costs and allowing for increased frac design optionality. Currently Lynx is performing plug and perf operations with 200 FT stages including two diversion drops per stage.

Lynx recently finished drilling Sergeant Major #1HXL one of the longest horizontal Hoxbar wells at ~20000 FT MD with a 9500 FT MD lateral. A combination of composites and dissolvable frac plugs were utilized to reduce completion risk. Lynx drilled out all plugs to TD and did not see the dissolvable plugs during milling or plug parts at surface indicating the technology performed as designed. The next step in Hoxbar completion evolution is to increase proppant volumes. Currently Lynx is placing 1800 lb/ft proppant. While monitoring offset wells during fracturing Lynx does not see any pressure interference at 600 FT spacing.

By GHK Lall

I learn that her Excellency Ambassador Sarah Ann Lynch is soon to on her way to the bright lights and big time. I am still working through whether to be delighted or disappointed. But this much I know for certain: Ambassador Lynch served her and my America well. My only issue is that in so doing my country this Guyana of mine fared so poorly. It is what striving tireless resourceful ambassadors do well how they measure up to expectations.

I study the mystique of this American doyenne of the diplomatic corps and wished that we had political presences and public servants like her in Guyana. I am reminded of that flamboyant American of legend one General of the Army Douglas MacArthur who was all about: Honor Duty Country. Of course something had to yield ground in the face of such indomitable will and in this instance Guyana turned out to be in the way had to be made into the fall guy. For to cut to the chase Ambassador Lynch held herself together in the simmering cauldron that is political Guyana and carried the day amidst the clashing war parties. Love her or leave her she was and is as American as apple pie and Guyanese had better not forget that as Exxon and Hess Corporation rejoice over the power of the American Government in their corner. Who could have asked for anything more? Who could have done better? It is at times like these that it pays to be of American pedigree American strain.

I think back and to the best of my recollection I have never heard the name or the word Exxon cross the American Ambassador’s lips. She did not have to since free and fair and democracy and rights of the people were the code words used instead and served just as well. She didn’t have to mention Exxon yet everybody felt the long formidable shadow of the American oil superpower and knew where things stood. If there was one thing that Guyana’s dear President Ali ever got right that was it. And the word around Georgetown first was don’t mess with the Americans and after that don’t mess with Texas. American groundwork as piloted by Ambassador Lynch paved the way for Exxon to be the behemoth that it is in Guyana today. Alistair Routledge’s machismo is based on Ambassador Lynch’s muscle and mind set like a bear trap. Without a spearhead like her clearing away the leadership turbulences of Guyana he is nothing but an empty suit and this is including his vaunted sanctity of contracts and all.

Excellency Lynch was the right warrior at the right time in the right place. She held one and all under her sway. Why some Guyanese even want to name streets after her erect monuments in her honor. It is an indication of how much imperialism and foreign adventurism still reigns supreme in the minds and hearts of countless Guyanese who should know better but are still caught in a time warp as they long for a time gone by. The American Ambassador was not doing what was good for Guyana but what was good for Exxon and America. The dearly beloved and departed Queen Elizabeth II of England and the Colonies couldn’t hold a candle to the departing American diplomat.

To repeat myself she has served America well. To Guyanese basking in the glow of her exploits that favored (or upset) their side all I say is this: get some sense folks it was all business and neither personal nor political. To paraphrase that long-ago big chief from General Motors and what he left for literary lore: what is good for Exxon is what is good for America. And in the still immortal words of a now ancient occupant of the White House: the business of America is business. If anyone sees anything about Guyana in either of those then they are either dumber or smarter than I am which takes a lot of doing

And to repeat myself still some more if only we had political leaders political representatives and political contributors with just a smidgen of Sarah Ann Lynch’s delicate sensitivities consummate diplomacy unswerving nationalist integrity and steadfast dedication to duty then Guyana could very have already started its own journey towards a clearer appreciation and some idea of what true greatness represents. When we ought to have leaders soaring as kings and queens in our friendly oil skies we have to settle for carrions and other craven vultures all too satisfied in making preys of their people.

Government bans on Russian oil since the invasion of Ukraine have spurred demand for alternative crudes and Guyanese oil fits refiners from Britain to Italy better than rival Latin American grades do.

So far this year 49% of Guyana's total oil exports have headed for Europe up from 16% in 2021. Cargoes to Europe averaged 110000 bpd from January through early September according to Refinitiv Eikon tanker tracking data more than the entire daily volume shipped to all destinations in 2021.

The shipments grew as Guyana's second floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) facility began pumping this year. In recent days the South American country's output hit 350000 barrels per day (bpd) almost triple its level early this year.

The oil produced by an Exxon Mobil Hess Corp and CNOOC consortium is entirely exported. Guyana sells its share through open-market tenders and via a trading unit of Saudi Aramco.

None of the parties have struck long-term supply deals with specific customers for the oil.

""They have all been spot cargoes. This is one of the few areas of the world that is expanding"" said an executive from a European company buying Guyanese crude since early 2022 both for trading and refining.

Spain's Repsol Italy's Eni and Britain's BP have taken cargoes the data showed. Repsol and Eni imported Venezuelan crude in the second quarter but shipments have remain suspended since July.

Exxon Hess and Repsol declined to comment on commercial agreements. Guyana's energy ministry Eni and BP did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

On Thursday Hess CEO John Hess told investors that Guyana wants ""to move forward as expeditiously as possible."" A development plan for the consortium's fifth project Uaru will be submitted for government approval later this year he said.

In 2021 Guyana exported 101000 bpd of crude most of which went to Asia. Shipments to Europe represented 16% of the total according to Refinitiv.

Guyana is now producing two crudes: a medium to light sweet oil called Liza and an even lighter grade called Unity Gold.

By 2027 the Exxon-led consortium which only in 2019 inaugurated output expects to pump 1.2 million bpd. Guyana is expected soon to schedule an auction of oil and gas blocks to attract new companies to its offshore fields.

The On-Premises segment recorded the maximum share of 71.22% for the Deployment sector. One of the primary advantages of this deployment model is that it provides continuous control and high data security in any organization. In several emerging countries a lack of awareness about the benefits of cloud-based solutions in business encourages the adoption of on-premises solutions. Furthermore segment growth is expected to be driven by the extended use of traditional methods to manage supply chains and other business functions with little automation and technological use.

The large business segment ruled the market with a share of over 60% by enterprise size. Notable factors driving the segment's growth are the growing requirement for large businesses to sustain and integrate critical procedures like production planning supply chain management sourcing employment order fulfillment and shipping. Yet another factor that encourages the incorporation of cloud-based ERP software is the large-sized businesses' increased expenditure to execute modern technology and software solutions. A U.S. Census report found that larger enterprises employ 48% of all employment in the nation. In Q1 FY2023 Walmart's income grew by 2.4% due to the arrival of its new employees and Amazon's income increased by around 8% year on year.

The finance segment led the market with a 28.75% share based on enterprise function. The ERP software helps to manage various financial activities like accounting assets cash flow and investments. As a result the increasing application of ERP in the financial function is expected to boost segment growth over the forecast period.

On the other hand the H.R.s (H.R.) segment also contributed to a significant market share. The rise in the need for managing the various HR operations due to organizations' rapid expansion is expediting the growth of this segment. Furthermore increased demand for automated systems in H.R. processes is expected to drive market growth over the forecast period. Statista has reported that around 55% of the larger organizations and almost 33% of the SMEs accepted the requirement for an Enterprise H.R.System Strategy in 2021 to manage their different operations.

The manufacturing and service segment of the industry sector held the largest market share of 20.45% in 2021. ERP software helps monitor daily operations manage customer service and track daily performances in this segment. Other advantages of the software include smoother inventory control real-time information tracking and production planning. Manufacturers are switching to ERP solutions because of the growing need to track vendor performance and improve visibility throughout the supply chain to help them with efficient operations planning and management.

North America ruled with a 35.21% market share as far as Regional segment is concerned. The large share is mainly due to some notable factors such as the growing acceptance of ERP software by medium-sized and small businesses enhanced investments by ERP vendors in software development using cutting-edge techniques and the presence of various market players. The market is also anticipated to grow during the forecast period because of increased access to ERP functionalities via smartphone applications. According to an SMR research survey approximately 26.1% of total American employees in 2022 are using the ERP software services of their specific organizations in the United States. Furthermore it was said that the success rate of ERP software implementation in the United States was nearly 65.1% in 2021.

It's the point in the season when the hot summer temperatures get replaced by a crispness in the air but there's an ever-heated intensity in the park as the playoffs approach.

It's also the time when fans get their first look at next season's schedule; a first chance to start plotting which ballparks they might visit. And for those who also love a nice hotel the chance to start plotting out where to stay.

From diehard fans to those who barely follow the sport the lifting of pandemic restrictions over the last couple of seasons has provided a distinct reminder that there's nothing quite like being at the park.

As dozens of clubs have opened sparkling new ballparks over the last 20 to 30 years fans largely have been treated to upgraded experiences not just in their seats in the stadium but in the area surrounding the park as de facto ""baseball villages"" have sprung up across the country.

These immersive and celebratory experiences aren't just in the areas immediately outside the turnstiles but in many nearby hotels too.

Earlier this summer I got a look at what it's like to stay in a room with a view of the diamond itself and how that can make for a more convenient and option-filled trip to the ballpark.

A direct view of the field is certainly not the only reason fans might be drawn to a particular hotel for game day though. Other hotels around the league offer everything from ballgame-enhancing packages to convenient parking and baseball-themed decor.

Atlanta: Omni Hotel at The Battery Atlanta

Nearby ballpark: Truist Park home of the Braves

Truist Park is the second-newest major league baseball stadium having opened in 2017. Along with the ballpark's opening came an entirely new development surrounding the park called The Battery which includes the Omni Hotel at The Battery Atlanta.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 OMNI HOTELS & RESORTS 0 1

Why we chose it: Proximity to ballpark parking family-oriented packages for fans

A good option for fans looking for a convenient game day hotel option the hotel is first and foremost convenient because of its location just steps from the ballpark's entrance.

Fans can soak in a rooftop pool while enjoying a view of the ballpark and most rooms in the hotel include some sort of ballpark view. For a pricier but even more iconic vantage point spring for a Premier room with a balcony where you can lounge with a bird's-eye perspective of the ballpark and surrounding ballpark village.

The hotel also offers packages for fans traveling as a family. The Baseball Package during the 2022 season included breakfast in the restaurant valet parking kids turndown service complete with milk and cookies and tickets for a behind-the-scenes tour of the park.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 OMNI HOTELS & RESORTS 0 1

Booking tips

If there's a sign of this park's popularity among fans — and thus a reason to consider it as you plan your 2023 travels — it's that the availability calendar on Omni's booking page shows the hotel regularly sells out when the Braves are in town.

OMNIHOTELS.COM

Prices noticeably spike on nights when there's a home game. When the team plays its 2022 home finale for the regular season on Oct. 3 prices start at $476 with a room that includes a balcony starting at $562.

Baltimore: Hilton Baltimore Inner Harbor

The Hilton Baltimore Inner Harbor. HILTON

Nearby ballpark: Camden Yards home of the Orioles

Few ballparks were as instrumental in showing what a major league stadium — and the surrounding area — could be as Baltimore's Camden Yards.

While fans won't want to miss the game day festivities inside the gates on Eutaw Street and in-game sights of the iconic red brick warehouse in right field you can catch a clean view of the diamond from beyond left field when staying in certain rooms at the Hilton Baltimore Inner Harbor.

HILTON

Why we chose it: Direct view of field access to Inner Harbor

While the property overall is fairly consistent with what you might expect for any flagship city-center major hotel brand I first took note of this hotel's great field view when visiting for a conference in 2016 albeit while the Orioles were out of town. While I wasn't lucky enough to have a room with a stadium view I did enjoy a glimpse of it while working in the executive lounge.

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sean Cudahy (@seancudahy)

There are even some higher-tier rooms with balconies that allow you to catch the action on the field and perhaps enjoy a bit of the ballpark ambiance from afar.

Don't want to miss a chance to catch the game up close? This Hilton is also notable for being a five-minute walk from the turnstiles.

It also connects via a covered walkway to the Baltimore Convention Center and is in close proximity to many of the restaurants and attractions in the Inner Harbor.

HILTON

Booking tips

You can find Stadium View and Home Plate View rooms for only a marginal cost increase over other accommodations. If your goal is to catch an inning or two from your room (though from a distance and without the ballpark sounds) I'd suggest a Home Plate View room for the clearest view of the field. I found that room type available for $257 on a game night.

HILTON.COM

I also found award availability for Stadium View and Home Plate View rooms starting at 50000 Hilton Honors points.

Boston: Hotel Commonwealth

HOTEL COMMONWEALTH

Nearest ballpark: Fenway Park home of the Red Sox

An independent hotel the Hotel Commonwealth in Boston's Kenmore Square notes on its website that it is the ""official hotel of the Boston Red Sox.""

HOTEL COMMONWEALTH

Why we chose it: Baseball-themed suites and game packages

You can catch a Red Sox game by simply walking three-tenths of a mile on the bridge over the Massachusetts Turnpike to baseball's oldest ballpark Fenway Park built in 1912.

While you won't catch a view of the diamond from your room many of the hotel's 200-plus rooms and suites include views of the ballpark's iconic green facade.

Families can enjoy a variety of baseball-themed packages offering everything from tickets to parking buckets of baseball-themed treats and gift cards to the team's official store.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 HOTEL COMMONWEALTH 0 1

Booking tips

Diehard fans lucky enough (and with enough cash) to lay claim to the property's two-floor top-level Fenway Suite will have a balcony facing Fenway a green-painted wall inside mimicking the park's famous Green Monster and Red Sox memorabilia and pennants inside the suite. This room was curated in consultation with the Red Sox.

A game-night stay for this suite in early October goes for more than $800.

HOTELCOMMONWEALTH.COM

However there are a number of other themed suites available at lower price points including a general baseball history-themed suite; the Terrier Suite in honor of nearby Boston University (which is also within walking distance of the property); and the Reading Suite which has literature-inspired decor.

Chicago: Hotel Zachary a Tribute Portfolio Hotel

The Hotel Zachary Chicago a Tribute Portfolio Hotel. TRIBUTE PORTFOLIO

Nearest ballpark: Wrigley Field home of the Cubs

Built in 1914 Wrigley Field is on the ballpark bucket list of every baseball fan who's yet to visit the hallowed grounds on which Chicago's beloved Cubs play.

Only two years younger than Fenway Park in Boston Cubs fans — like Red Sox fans — can enjoy a modern game-day atmosphere outside the stadium while still enjoying the history of the park and its surroundings.

Located just across the street from Wrigley Field the Hotel Zachary is a nod to the ballpark's architect Zachary Taylor Davis whose design sketch of the stadium adorns a wall in the lobby.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 4 TRIBUTE PORTFOLIO 0 1 2 3

Why we chose it: Unique hotel in a convenient location

As part of Marriott's Tribute Portfolio this property leans heavily into the sport played just across the street alongside other distinct local touches. In the Ballpark Loft Suite there are dark-wood floors and a partial dividing wall with a flat-screen TV near windows overlooking Wrigleyville the neighborhood around the park. There's a good chance you'll even have a view of the stadium's outer facade as well.

TRIBUTE PORTFOLIO

The living room in the property's most coveted suite the Marquee Suite has photos of the team and the city's history hanging on a dark-green wall that's reminiscent of Wrigley's ivy.

TRIBUTE PORTFOLIO

The Hotel Zachary is so close to Wrigley that a disclaimer on the property's site warns that nearby streets might be closed on game days. Meanwhile the hotel's Alma Room restaurant and The Bar at Hotel Zachary provide a convenient place to grab food or drinks before or after catching a Cubs game.

Booking tips

While the cost of suites can reach four digits when the Cubs are in town I found a standard guest room (with a view of Wrigley) as low as $362 with award availability at a pricier 60000 Marriott Bonvoy points.

San Diego: Omni San Diego Hotel

OMNI HOTELS & RESORTS

Nearest ballpark: Petco Park home of the Padres

A second Omni hotel makes the list for its proximity to a major league ballpark though this Southern California property stands out from its counterpart in Atlanta for having a direct stadium connection.

OMNI HOTELS & RESORTS

Why we chose it: Direct connection to ballpark baseball-themed packages

While you won't want to miss the festivities shopping and dining options in the Gaslamp Quarter you don't actually have to hit the streets of San Diego when you stay at the Omni San Diego Hotel.

That's because the property is connected by a ""sky bridge"" to Petco Park home of the Padres since 2004.

The ""sky bridge"" connects the hotel to the ballpark at the Omni San Diego Hotel. OMNI HOTELS & RESORTS

Omni notes this is the only hotel in the U.S. that's actually connected physically to a major league ballpark. (Note: It's not the only one in the league though. We'll get to that in a moment.)

Plenty of rooms at this hotel have views of the ballpark's outer facade as does the rooftop pool.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 OMNI HOTELS & RESORTS 0 1

Fans can immerse themselves in the baseball experience when they stay here. The hotel regularly offers sport-themed packages like the ""San Diego Baseball Package"" which in 2022 offered fans 20% off on Padres tickets.

Booking tips

While prices often spike when the Padres play a night game (frequently between $300 and $400) I found a standard room rate starting at $289 on an early fall weekend when the team plays an afternoon game.

San Francisco: Luma Hotel San Francisco

LUMA HOTEL SAN FRANCISCO

Nearest ballpark: Oracle Park home of the Giants

A good choice if you're thinking of attending a game in the Bay Area Luma Hotel San Francisco opened earlier this summer and is conveniently located just across Mission Bay from the Giants' Oracle Park.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 LUMA HOTEL SAN FRANCISCO 0 1

Why we chose it: Views of the park and the bay

The hotel which boasts nearly 300 rooms includes plenty of high-floor accommodations for maximum sightseeing without leaving your bedside.

For Giants fans the property — which has a sister hotel in New York's Times Square — is just a five-or-so-minute walk from the ballpark. You can take the pedestrian sidewalk aboard the 4th Street Bridge over Mission Bay and you'll quickly be at the stadium.

SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE/HEARST NEWSPAPERS/GETTY IMAGES

Booking tips

Rooms with a notable view start with the property's Premier rooms which are between the ninth and 16th floors.

LUMAHOTELS.COM

Hotel staff members tell TPG they can't guarantee a ballpark view but you can call or email them with your request and they'll do their best to make it happen. Frankly you might want to skip the ballpark view in favor of a view of the bay. After all views of the water are perhaps one of the most distinctive features of the Giants' home anyway.

A similar concept to Hilton's hotel in Baltimore fans staying at the Hilton St. Louis at the Ballpark can enjoy the property's views and its proximity to all the action at and around the park.

Why we chose it: Room and rooftop views of field and proximity to park

For starters you can easily walk to catch a Cardinals game. During my stay at this property in June I was inside the gates of Busch Stadium less than 10 minutes after leaving my high-floor room — a good portion of which was spent waiting for and riding the elevator.

Like many of the hotels on this list it's a great option if you'd like to avoid the pregame traffic or late-night ride home in a car or on public transportation.

While older and not particularly memorable for its decor or amenities this Hilton hotel boasts views of the playing field from rooms as well as from the property's rooftop bar.

No it's not the closest view of the action on the field and you won't hear the crowd cheering but the setup is ripe for being fashionably late to your seat after dinner or drinks at the bar overlooking the park.

You could even catch the last couple of innings from the comfort of your room as I did during my visit.

Booking tips

Book the Stadium View when selecting a room if seeing the field is your priority. There are also Arch View rooms which give you an alternative sightline of the city's iconic Gateway Arch which by the way is just a five-minute walk from the hotel.

Arlington Texas: Live! by Loews — Arlington

LIVE! BY LOEWS — ARLINGTON

Nearest ballpark: Globe Life Field home of the Rangers

While many U.S. cities have gone to great lengths to create an entire experience surrounding a ballpark with restaurants bars shops and hotels there are few places that have done it quite like Arlington.

Live! by Loews has a view not just of the Texas Rangers' stadium but of the Dallas Cowboys' home too. LIVE! BY LOEWS — ARLINGTON

Why we chose it: Immersive sports experience additional entertainment options

Live! by Loews is a large resort that sits steps away from Globe Life Field baseball's newest ballpark and home of the Texas Rangers. The hotel is also within walking distance of AT&T Stadium home of the National Football League's Dallas Cowboys and is part of the overall Texas Live! entertainment district between the two stadiums featuring shops restaurants sports bars and a massive beer garden.

LIVE! BY LOEWS — ARLINGTON

While images of the overall complex feature many bright lights television screens and crowds you can offset any sensory overload by swimming up to the bar in the infinity pool overlooking the Cowboys' monstrous stadium or relaxing on the rooftop terrace.

It's worth noting that a stay at this property also puts you within a mile of another thrill: Six Flags Over Texas.

Booking tips

Prices can be pretty extreme — even reaching four digits — when the complex hits a sort of sports equinox due to the Cowboys and Rangers playing on the same day but you can find a bit more modest pricing if you pick a slightly less in-demand night.

I found rooms starting at $377 on a Rangers game night.

Toronto: Toronto Marriott City Centre Hotel

Nearest ballpark: Rogers Centre home of the Blue Jays

While Camden Yards gets a lot of credit for revolutionizing the concept of what a modern ballpark can be when you think about the origin of the ""ballpark hotel"" you have to think of the one literally connected to the massive domed stadium that's home to the Toronto Blue Jays.

Why we chose it: Hotel located inside ballpark

Yes the Omni in San Diego is connected by a bridge to the ballpark there but there's no other hotel that's integrated into the park design quite like the Marriott Toronto City Centre Hotel.

Since the Blue Jays' home opened as SkyDome in 1989 the windows of hotel rooms have been one of the things fans and players alike can see when they look toward the outfield which likewise means guests on the other side of the glass can truly sit and watch the game from the comfort of their room.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 MARRIOTT HOTELS 0 1

A number of the ballpark-facing rooms are split-level so in addition to the unparalleled views of a ballpark you're also getting a unique concept compared to other flagship Marriott properties.

You can also watch the game from Sportsnet Grill the hotel's 200-plus-seat sports bar which features floor-to-ceiling windows allowing fans and guests to catch the action on the field without a field-view room.

MARRIOTT HOTELS

Another perk of staying at this property is that you're right in the heart of downtown Toronto with the CN Tower just a short walk from the property.

Booking tips

Look for Stadium View rooms when you book but beware that rates can get pretty pricey. Stadium View rooms for a game night in September 2022 in the midst of a Blue Jays postseason push start at $667.

MARRIOTT.COM

Keep in mind the hotel does not guarantee a view of the stadium on nights when the Blue Jays aren't playing at home.

Nearby ballpark: Nationals Park home of the Nationals

The area surrounding Washington's Nationals Park has evolved dramatically since the team moved in back in 2008. Among the many new hotels restaurants and high-rise apartments that have since sprung up in the neighborhood is Hyatt's Thompson.

CAROLINE TANNER/THE POINTS GUY

Why we chose it: Location

While this property won't put you within a stone's throw of the Lincoln Memorial or the Capitol it will put you as the hotel accurately says ""just around the corner"" from Nationals Park. We're talking mere tenths of a mile much of which (speaking from experience) will be full of game day festivities when the Nationals play. But don't be mistaken: This isn't a hotel with baseball decor on the walls or special game packages.

CAROLINE TANNER/THE POINTS GUY

It's a modern hotel with a boutique feel just steps away from the game and the Metro's Green Line at the Navy Yard-Ballpark station.

While valet parking goes for $27 per day (a bargain compared to what you might find elsewhere) save by taking the Metro to the hotel from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) or Union Station.

Looking to eat a true dinner before you head for the gates? TPG reporter Caroline Tanner enjoyed her meal at the on-site restaurant Maialino Mare when she visited and reviewed the property in 2021.

What's even better is that you can enjoy a nice view of the ballpark (and sunset over it if you time it right) from the Thompson's rooftop bar.

CAROLINE TANNER/THE POINTS GUY

Booking tips

While you may score a view of Nationals Park from some rooms the view alone may not be worth paying any extra.

CAROLINE TANNER/THE POINTS GUY

For a stay at the Thompson on a September 2022 game night against Beltway rival the Baltimore Orioles rates started at $304 or 23000 World of Hyatt points.

Bottom line

SEAN CUDAHY/THE POINTS GUY

There are any number of factors to consider when booking a hotel near a major league ballpark from views to parking amenities convenience and your loyalty program of choice.

The companies announced this week that same-day delivery will be available from more than 1700 Lowe’s stories nationwide with 30000 items available in as little as an hour including bulkier items such as portable grills and firepits. Lowe’s says it’s one of the first retailers to take advantage of Instacart’s app-based service.

Home Depot which was one of the first announced retail customers of Walmart’s outsourced GoLocal delivery service last fall expanded it to multiple markets by the end of 2021. But it doesn’t allow for delivery of big and bulky items as Lowe’s does. The latter lets customers to order items up to up to 3x3x5 feet and 60 pounds that can come same day via the new Instacart service.

In March Walmart merged GoLocal with its Delivery Services platform which provides access to a network of last-mile carriers for merchants and offers tracking visibility and communication for end customers.

“Lowe’s knows how much this time of year means to our customers” said Mike Shady Lowe’s senior vice president of online in a release. “Whether they are rounding out their Halloween decorating or getting started on holiday prep and gifting we’re able to offer more products more convenience and more value for customers as we continue to improve the shopping experience in-store and online.”

In a related move Instacart last month rolled out a big-and-bulky delivery offering entering the sphere of last-mile providers like UPS’s Roadie and XPO Logistics. Some early customers of the service include Big Lots Container Store Mastermind Toys Office Depot Spirit Halloween and Staples. The company touts the ability for shoppers to order larger items like televisions alongside their typical grocery order.

Instacart’s expansion of its mainstay grocery delivery service make perfect sense given the falloff in the last year of e-grocery and symbiotic delivery services after a massive boom driven by the pandemic lockdowns.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9hdGxhbnRhL25ld3MvMjAyMi8wOS8wOS9ob21lLWRlcG90LXByb2ZpdHMtcmVub3ZhdGlvbi1wcm9qZWN0cy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'You are truly never done': Home Depot sees aging homes ceaseless renovations as boon to business - Atlanta ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2022/09/09/home-depot-profits-renovation-projects.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9hdGxhbnRhL25ld3MvMjAyMi8wOS8wOS9ob21lLWRlcG90LXByb2ZpdHMtcmVub3ZhdGlvbi1wcm9qZWN0cy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RpbmNocm9uaWNsZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLTA5LTA5L2Zvci1zdC1qb2hucy1uZWlnaGJvcnMtaXRzLXRpbWUtdG8td2VpZ2gtaW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,For St. Johns Neighbors It's Time to Weigh In,"The St. Johns community has been waiting a long time to see progress at the former Home Depot site that the city has promised to turn into affordable housing retail and community space. Now the city has launched the next phase of its plan – gathering community input through a series of events a survey and forming a committee to oversee the process.

In 2008 the city used $6.9 million from a 2006 public safety bond to buy the 19-acre property in order to turn it into a new Austin Police Department substation and home for the Municipal Court. But that didn't happen and in the years since the community watched as city officials proposed turning the site into everything from affordable housing to a homeless encampment. Last year that paradigm shifted when the city entered into an exclusive negotiation agreement with Greystar Develop­ment Central to partner with the Housing Authority of the City of Austin to redevelop the site with new housing retail office and green space. In April the city executed that agreement.

For Thelma Williams whose family moved into the neighborhood in 1947 back before its streets were paved and many of its houses had electricity the city's evolving commitment to the site and attention to the concerns of its residents has been remarkable. ""The city was going to use the site for a police department"" she said. ""Just for them to have gotten to this point it's a miracle really.""

The next steps of the project will be focused on gathering more community input – a particularly critical step given the history of St. Johns a historically Black and now largely Latino neighborhood that is wary of the threat of accelerating the pace of ongoing gentrification.

There are signals that the city is aware of that threat. The exclusive negotiating agreement stipulates that the developers seek to set aside at least half of the housing units as affordable rentals and a council resolution passed in June declared that the development should ""honor and respect the rich Black and Hispanic history of the St. Johns neighborhood"" and support ""a complete community in a historic neighborhood."" The city has also stated that it wants Grey­star and HACA to identify partnerships that address the city's ""right to stay"" and ""right to return"" policies prioritizing rental applications from current and former neighborhood residents.

Greg Casar who represented the St. Johns neighborhood on City Council before resigning to run for Congress said last year that the redevelopment plan could potentially be used as a model for other gentrifying parts of Austin – an approach that prioritizes keeping people in place in the development process. Chito Vela who succeeded Casar on Council agreed telling the Chronicle that he ""strongly supports"" giving preference to applicants with ties to the neighborhood and that ""the robust community engagement process and high level of affordability already make this a model project."" Williams agreed as well noting that her grandchildren would struggle to afford to live in her neighborhood. ""I don't want to lose the history of this community just because they are developing something there"" she said.

Representatives from the city Greystar and HACA will hold a resource fair and discussion this Saturday Sept. 10 at the neighborhood's Virginia L. Brown Recrea­tion Center 7500 Blessing Ave. and the community can expect more events like it before the developers return to City Council with development terms in November. There's also a Sept. 12 virtual com­munity meeting (register at bit.ly/3x3Vqaj) and an online community survey (see bit.ly/3AQE1Tx). And finally members of the community can apply to serve on the St. Johns Community Advisory Committee (see bit.ly/3QkWJZa).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdXNlZGlnZXN0LmNvbS9zdG9yaWVzL3doeS1idXlpbmctYXBwbGlhbmNlcy1hdC1ob21lLWRlcG90LW1heS1jYXVzZS15b3UtdHJvdWJsZS_SAV5odHRwczovL3d3dy5ob3VzZWRpZ2VzdC5jb20vc3Rvcmllcy93aHktYnV5aW5nLWFwcGxpYW5jZXMtYXQtaG9tZS1kZXBvdC1tYXktY2F1c2UteW91LXRyb3VibGUv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Buying Appliances At Home Depot May Cause You Trouble,While The Home Depot carries a decent selection of different appliance types and brands their customer service isn't the best and the return policy on major appliances may cause some frustration.

(Wilson Ring/AP)

WASHINGTON (Tribune News Service) — Every one of the more than 825 F-35 fighter jets delivered so far contain a component made with a Chinese alloy that's prohibited by both U.S. law and Pentagon regulations according to the program office that oversees the aircraft.

The component — a magnet used in an aircraft-powering device supplied by Honeywell International Inc. — has been used in the plane since 2003 the Pentagon's F-35 program office said. On Wednesday the Pentagon suspended deliveries of new F-35s to make sure the program complies with regulations related to ""specialty metals.""

The F-35 program — which may result in over 3300 jets — will now seek a national security waiver from the Pentagon's top acquisition official William LaPlante to resume deliveries of already assembled new aircraft containing the alloy F-35 spokesman Russell Goemaere said.

Speaking to reporters on Friday LaPlante said a waiver was likely if there were no security or safety issues.

""I'm hoping this can be resolved pretty soon"" LaPlante said.

The program office doesn't anticipate ""replacing magnets in delivered aircraft"" according to Goemaere. Replacing them could entail costly and time-consuming retrofits of the over 500 U.S. training and operational aircraft. The Pentagon and Lockheed Martin Corp. which builds the aircraft have found a U.S. source for the alloy for future planes the company said.

U.S. law and Pentagon acquisition regulations prohibit the use of specialty metals or alloys made China Iran North Korea or Russia. The Defense Contract Management Agency reported the violation to the F-35 program office on Aug. 19.

A decade ago the Pentagon granted a waiver to Honeywell to use Chinese magnets in other F-35 components saying the program already beset by delays and cost overruns would have been slowed even more.

The program office says the part has no technical flaw and it poses no security risk to the U.S.'s top stealth fighter or its 8 million lines of software code. Rather it's a question of supply-chain security and why the banned alloy wasn't detected by Honeywell. The Pentagon's judgment that China poses the biggest threat to the US globally only adds to the challenge.

The case illustrates what LaPlante called ""supply chain illumination.""

""I had CEO tell me two weeks ago that he thought he had 300 suppliers and he discovered when he counted all of the suppliers he probably had 3000 and suppliers can change overnight"" LaPlante said.

When the halt was announced Honeywell said it was working with the Pentagon and Lockheed and was ""committed to supplying high-quality products that meet or exceed all customer contract requirements."" Spokesman Adam Kress said the company has no additional comment.

The device in question is a magnet contained in a Honeywell turbomachine that integrates the aircraft's auxiliary power unit and an air cycle machine into a single piece of equipment that provides electrical power for ground maintenance main engine startup and emergency power.

It includes a cobalt and samarium alloy ""recently determined to be produced in the People's Republic of China"" and magnetized in the US the F-35 program office said. It was provided to a Honeywell subcontractor by a lower-tier supplier Lockheed Martin said.

""We are working with our partners and DoD to ensure contractual compliance within the supply chain"" Lockheed Martin spokeswoman Laura Siebert said in statement. ""We are working with the DOD to resolve the issue as quickly as possible to resume deliveries.""

Lockheed Martin delivered 88 of a contracted 148 F-35 jets this year before the halt.

Honeywell is collaborating with DENSO a leading maker of automotive electric motors and controllers to create a variety of electric propulsion systems for aircraft.

There’s more than one way to propel an airplane.

While it’s true that most aircraft engines today run on fossil fuels like Jet A Jet B Avgas or diesel many readers may be shocked (pun intended) to learn that electric technology will change the way we think about aircraft propulsion – and sooner rather than later.

In fact around 215 types of electric-powered aircraft are currently being developed worldwide and industry observers say electric airplanes will be commonplace before the end of the next decade.

At Honeywell we’re applying our unique expertise from across our Engines and Power Systems portfolio and working with DENSO a world leader in electric motors and controllers for the automotive industry to transform aircraft propulsion as we know it. Together we aim to deliver innovative and integrated solutions to current (retrofit) and future (clean-sheet) customers in the rapidly-growing electric aircraft space.

The logical path toward electric propulsion

Two key technologies for the future of flight have a long history. Electric motors were invented in the 1830s and battery-powered cars were first manufactured in the 1890s. Their descendants are found across various industries today including in modern airplanes that already rely on electricity to power avionics fly-by-wire actuation and other systems and perform tasks once done by mechanical equipment.

When we talk about electric propulsion we’re talking about a range of propulsion architectures designed to meet the needs of specific aircraft that are using electrically driven motors to provide thrust. There is no “one-size-fits-all” or “best” solution without understanding the key customer requirements and mission profile of an aircraft.

Honeywell has studied several different propulsion architectures – ranging from the legacy engines on most aircraft today to all-electric battery-based solutions. There are various hybrid architectures across that continuum – including Turboelectric Partial Turboelectric Series Hybrid Parallel Hybrid and Series-Parallel Hybrid. All of these deploy electric motors in various ways as part of the overall propulsion system.

How electric propulsion works

In contrast to propulsion systems built solely around an internal combustion engine all-electric and hybrid-electric architectures utilize an electric motor. The motor can be the sole source of thrust or it can be used in combination with a conventional engine by either providing another source of thrust or even a boost of power to the propulsion system during key stages of flight.

In addition to the motor a fully-integrated electric propulsion system includes other critical components like motor controller hardware and software gearboxes and cooling systems. This integrated system is known as an electric propulsion unit (EPU) and Honeywell and DENSO are developing state-of-the-art solutions to meet today’s and tomorrow’s needs.

While battery technology matures hybrid-electric aircraft will need both batteries and other power sources – like ultraefficient generators or fuel cells – to power the aircraft recharge the batteries and improve aircraft safety efficiency and range.

What’s behind the Honeywell-DENSO partnership?

There is important work to be done to ensure quality and certification to aviation standards which are very familiar to Honeywell and other experienced aviation companies. But many other challenges in meeting these new customers’ needs are more germane to the automotive industry. Our partner DENSO has the proven ability to mass-produce complex systems – like EPUs – at scale while maintaining the highest standards of quality and reliability.

That’s why Honeywell and DENSO decided to form an alliance to combine the respective strengths of two leaders to create best-in-class electric propulsion units.

The Honeywell/DENSO team is already working on some very exciting development programs and we’re always looking for new opportunities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYXZpYXRpb25pc3QuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMTAvZi0zNS1kZWxpdmVyaWVzLWhhbHRlZC1hcy1jaGluZXNlLWFsbG95LXdhcy1mb3VuZC1pbi10dXJib21hY2hpbmUtcHVtcHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,F-35 Deliveries Halted As Chinese Alloy Was Found In Turbomachine Pumps,"The alloy is used by a contractor to make magnets for Honeywell’s turbomachine pumps.

The Pentagon has temporally stopped F-35 deliveries after officials discovered that an alloy used in magnets on the jet’s turbomachine pumps was produced in China. The Defense Contract Management Agency first notified the F-35 Joint Program Office about the potential problem on August 19 before both agreed to suspend the deliveries on Aug. 31 2022.

The F-35 program office “temporarily paused the acceptance of new F-35 aircraft to ensure the F-35 program’s compliance” with defense regulations “pertaining to specialty metals” said Defense Department spokesman Russell Goemaere in a statement. He also added the pause won’t interfere with operations of F-35s already delivered because “the magnet does not transmit information or harm the integrity of the aircraft and there are no performance quality safety or security risks associated with this issue.”

The reason behind the need for the suspension is a U.S. law and a separate Pentagon acquisition regulation that prohibit the use of certain specialty metals or alloys produced by specific countries outlined in the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation series which are China Iran North Korea and Russia. The alloy in question is a cobalt and samarium alloy “recently determined to be produced in the People’s Republic of China” and magnetized in the US according to the F-35 JPO.

The alloy is used in a magnet contained in a Honeywell turbomachine that integrates the aircraft’s auxiliary power unit and an air cycle machine into a single piece of equipment which that provides power for ground maintenance main engine startup and emergency power. The magnet was provided by a “fifth-tier” subcontractor to the manufactured of the lube pump which in turn supplies it to Honeywell.

“Honeywell has stopped work with the supplier providing alloy and an alternative U.S. source is already on order with anticipated delivery next month” said Lockheed Martin spokeswoman Laura Siebert. However every one of the more than 825 F-35 fighter jets delivered so far contain the magnet made with the prohibited Chinese alloy. The component has been used in the 5th gen aircraft since 2003.

The F-35 will now need a national security waiver from the Pentagon’s top acquisition official William LaPlante to resume deliveries of already assembled aircraft containing the prohibited alloy. Something similar already happened a decade ago when the Pentagon granted a waiver to Honeywell to use Chinese magnets in other F-35 components in order to avoid new delays and cost overruns. The F-35 JPO doesn’t anticipate replacing the magnets in the aircraft already delivered.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vaW50ZXJlc3RpbmdlbmdpbmVlcmluZy5jb20vc2NpZW5jZS9iYW5uZWQtY2hpbmVzZS1hbGxveS1pbi1mMzUtc2VjdXJpdHktY29uY2VybnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Banned Chinese alloy in all F-35s annoys the US raising security concerns,"“The component – a magnet used in an aircraft-powering device supplied by Honeywell International Inc. – has been used in the plane since 2003” said the Pentagon’s F-35 program office.

According to F-35 spokesman Russell Goemaere the program which could produce over 3300 jets will now ask the Pentagon’s senior acquisition official William LaPlante for a national security waiver to start deliveries of already completed new aircraft containing the alloy.

Goemaere stated that the project office does not anticipate “replacing magnets in delivered aircraft” since it would be costly and time-consuming to retrofit more than 500 US operational and training aircraft.

“A waiver was likely if there were no security or safety issues” LaPlante said in a presser on Friday. “I’m hoping this can be resolved pretty soon.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vdG9wLXRyZW5kaW5nLXByb2R1Y3RzL2tpdGNoZW4tZGluaW5nL2Fpci1wdXJpZmllci9iZXN0LWFpci1wdXJpZmllcnMtdW5kZXItcnMtMTUwMDAvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTQwOTk4OTguY21z0gGMAWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS90b3AtdHJlbmRpbmctcHJvZHVjdHMva2l0Y2hlbi1kaW5pbmcvYWlyLXB1cmlmaWVyL2Jlc3QtYWlyLXB1cmlmaWVycy11bmRlci1ycy0xNTAwMC9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTQwOTk4OTguY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best Air Purifiers under Rs 15000,"Things to Know Before Purchasing an Air Purifier

(These lawsuits have been consolidated into this class action.) On June 4 2019 ARM released a four-minute video documenting egregious abuse of calves at the farm — including calves who were stabbed with steel bars hit in the face with hard plastic milking bottles kneed in the spine and subjected to extreme temperatures sometimes leading to death. A second extended video was released by ARM on June 7 2019 showing more footage of abuse at Fair Oaks Farm.

Animal Recovery Mission subsequently released two more investigations showing similar animal abuse against mothers and their calves at other dairies associated with Fairlife and Select Milk Producers. These videos show the abuse at Fair Oaks Farm is not anomalous as Fairlife has argued.

As consumers become more aware of the cruelty in factory farming demand grows for animal products produced in less abusive conditions. In marketing its milk products Fairlife claims it “provide[s] extraordinary animal care.” But contrary to Fairlife’s marketing its milk actually comes from animals who are subjected to severe abuse and horrific industry practices intrinsic to operating a dairy where thousands of cows are crowded together and treated as milk machines. Consumers who care about animal well-being relied on Fairlife’s representations and paid a premium for milk that they believed came from cows who had a higher standard of living and were not abused.

Who is being sued why and under what law: Dairy company Fairlife is facing a class action lawsuit alleging fraud negligent misrepresentation unjust enrichment and violations of state consumer protection laws.

What court is the lawsuit filed in: The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated multiple lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.

Why this case is important: Increasing public concern regarding the treatment of animals raised for food has led to a phenomenon called “humane-washing” where companies induce conscientious consumers to buy products based on false promises of “better” animal treatment. This deceptive marketing hurts consumers animals and plant-based companies offering truly humane options.

Undercover investigations on factory farms and slaughterhouses have brought severe animal abuses to light in recent years. These abuses are systemic and are not isolated incidents. Cows used by the dairy industry are forcibly impregnated and kept pregnant almost continuously to maintain milk production and their calves are taken from them immediately after birth to be thrust into the endless line of abused and suffering animals on factory farms. Once the cows stop producing sufficient milk they’re transported to slaughter.

Abuse is built into the factory farm model and virtually all animal products sold in stores come from factory farms. Instead of addressing systemic cruelty in animal agriculture some companies have merely changed their marketing to fraudulently capitalize on consumers’ concern for the welfare of animals. These tactics deprive consumers of the ability to make meaningful informed decisions about their purchases and allow companies to continue profiting off of cruelty despite evolving consumer preferences.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWxpbWFya2V0bmV3cy5jb20vcXVpY2stYml0ZS90eXNvbi1mb29kcy1kb25hdGVzLTI1bS1maWdodC1odW5nZXItYW5kLXBhcnRuZXJzLWZlZWRpbmctYW1lcmljYS10aW0tZ3JhaWxlci1hbmQtZXJpa2EtdGhpZW0tZGlzY3Vzcy9wZWdneS1wYWNrZXIvZnJpLTA5MDkyMDIyLTA4NTIvMTQyMDfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tyson Foods Donates 2.5M to Fight Hunger and Partners With Feeding America®; Tim Grailer and Erika Thiem Discuss,"SPRINGDALE AR



Eating protein is key to a healthy diet and Tyson Foods is making sure more consumers have access to the category. The supplier is teaming up with Feeding America® member food banks to address food insecurity with a $2.5 million donation. During September which is Hunger Action Month® Tyson is also donating 2.5 million lbs of protein the equivalent of 10 million meals.

“Tyson has been a long-time partner of Feeding America as their mission to improve access to nutritious food for all is aligned with our mission to Feed the World. This partnership with Feeding America to expand capacity and help rural communities and communities of color is the next step in our evolving strategic partnership” said Tim Grailer Senior Director Tyson Foods. “With inflation putting pressures on the charitable food system both increasing their costs and the need for their services there has never been a more important time to support these efforts.”

According to a press release Tyson Foods will allocate $1 million of its donation to support Equitable Food Access grants which aim to improve access to nutritious food among people experiencing the highest rates of food insecurity with a focus on communities of color and/or people living in rural communities.

The remainder of the donation will go toward expanding capacity to repack bulk or private label protein products into family-size quantities thus increasing the types of protein that can easily be donated and distributed.

“While hunger exists in every county across the country it impacts each community in vastly different ways requiring thoughtful and strategic solutions” said Erika Thiem Chief Supply Chain Officer Feeding America. “One in eight people including one in six children in America are food insecure. As food banks continue to face increasing demand we're thankful for partners like Tyson whose ongoing food and fund donations are supporting our network’s efforts to increase access to protein a high-need item and ensure equitable access to food for communities facing hunger.”

Hats off to these two organizations for their important work to end hunger.",,,,,,

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

According to HP the HP PageWide Advantage 2200 series is designed to meet the needs of print service providers of all sizes. The new series apparently offers industry-leading productivity quality and media versatility for those in publishing direct mail and commercial print.

Annette Friskopp global head and general manager at HP PageWide explains: “This new PageWide Advantage platform is a game changer for the commercial print industry.

“HP has listened to our customers and we realize ease of use and up-time are critical success factors. This new press offers configurations to enable customers to optimize the press for their quality productivity versatility and economics to grow their digital production businesses.”

HP says that the HP PageWide Advantage 2200 is capable of speeds of up to 500 ft/min colour and 800 ft/min mono. The company adds that it can print high coverage jobs at up to 90 million US letter-sized mono images per month or 214000 personalized A3 colour duplex sheets per shift.

Apparently recognising the need to print postcards and other applications with thicker stocks HP explains that the new press delivers heightened productivity for high-impact full-coverage jobs.

In addition the company says the new press has the ability to print using HP Brilliant Ink and 2400 native nozzle per inch printheads. This reportedly offers enhanced quality for a wide range of higher-value applications including colourful trade and educational books and high-coverage impactful direct mail pieces that differentiate clients in the market.

HP claims that the HP PageWide Advantage includes a single print arch design with a robust paper path with fewer components reducing the number of parts to manage and therefore the overall maintenance and servicing time. According to the company this increases reliability and ease of use and maximises uptime.

The company adds that the new press is designed to offer configuration flexibility featuring a modular design that allows customers to start with a lower capacity machine and then enhance the machine as their businesses grow or application mixes shift. Customers can apparently select 1 2 or 3 dryer modules along with passive or active web cooling modules to fit their needs.

The HP PageWide Advantage 2200 features a compact single-engine duplex design providing high quality and productivity while saving floor space for customers according to HP. The company says the press also comes equipped with its High Efficiency Drying (HED) system that reportedly minimises power usage at high print speeds by recirculating up to 80% of the air heated during the drying process.

Kevin Hughes chief operating officer at SG360º said comments: “We were pleased to see the HP PageWide Advantage 2200 team wrap up installation in one week. Time is money in our business and this accomplishment is terrific for both SG360º & HP customers. Additionally within weeks of this press being in operation we have printed over 20 million images and are absolutely excited for future possibilities using its terrific print quality.”

Ann Gayou senior vice president of plant management at O’Neil Digital Solutions adds: “As a longtime customer and partner with the HP PageWide team we have purchased 13 PageWide web presses and we are quite excited to have installed the very first HP Advantage in the world.

“Our operators were able to easily learn the latest features and simplicity of operations and were producing millions of pages a week in no time. We selected a 2 HED dryer configuration and are thrilled with the press’s productivity and the quality of HP Brilliant Ink.”

The HP PageWide Advantage 2200 is expected to be commercially available worldwide in October 2022.

Last year HP rolled out an enhanced sheet-feeding system for its PageWide C500 press aimed at accelerating growth in the digital corrugated market through higher productivity and lower costs. The C500 top feeder innovation was recognised by the PRINTING United Alliance which granted it the 2021 Pinnacle InterTech Award.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnNjb29wcy5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS9zd2lzcy1zdGFydHVwLXBpZWNoLWF1dG9tb3RpdmUtaGlyZXMtZm9ybWVyLWFtZy1hbmQtYXN0b24tbWFydGluLWJvc3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Swiss Startup Piech Automotive Hires Former AMG And Aston Martin Boss,"Piech Automotive a Swiss electric sports car startup announced today that it has added two senior executives with impressive automotive backgrounds to its roster. Tobias Moers and Manfred Fitzgerald will act as co-Chief Executive Officers at the young company.

Tobias Moers most recently was the CEO of Aston Martin a position he took in 2020. He left Mercedes’ AMG division where he had been the CEO since 2013 to take the role but was ultimately replaced at the British company by Ferrari’s former CEO Amadeo Felisa in May.

At Piech Automotive AG the 56-year-old auto executive will take on both the role of co-CEO as well as the role of Chief Technical Officer. Moers will “now shape the future of the young Swiss brand as the company’s head of development” the startup wrote in a press release.

Manfred Fitzgerald meanwhile will similarly take on a double role. On top of being a co-chief executive he will be the new chairman of the executive board and will take on a principal management role with the company.

Before taking on this job the executive worked as the executive vice president and global head of Genesis. Having worked there since 2016 he played an important part in developing the brand into a successful premium automaker.

He is not without experience in the sport and supercar segments though. Before working at Genesis he was the director of brand and design for Lamborghini.

Together the CEOs will work to develop the Piech Automotive brand into a legitimate sports car manufacturer. The company announced last October that it will release a classic two-door coupe with three electric motors that can generate up to 600 hp (447 kW/608 PS) weighs around 3968 lbs (1800 kg) and has a range of 311 miles (500 km).

Due to arrive in 2024 the company says it will be able to produce around 1200 Piech GTs per year and plans to sell the car in Europe China and the U.S.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nbG9iZW5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2UvMjAyMi8wOS8wOS8yNTEzMTY2LzI4MTI0L2VuL1VuaXRlZC1TdGF0ZXMtVHJhY3RvcnMtTWFya2V0LVJlcG9ydC0yMDIyLXRvLTIwMjgtRmVhdHVyaW5nLUpvaG4tRGVlcmUtQUdDTy1hbmQtS3Vib3RhLUFtb25nLU90aGVycy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,United States Tractors Market Report (2022 to 2028) - Featuring John Deere AGCO and Kubota Among Others,"Dublin Sept. 09 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""U.S. Tractors Market - Industry Analysis & Forecast 2022-2028"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.



In 2021 the less than 50 HP segment accounted for the largest share due to its compact size and flexible operational capabilities.



North America accounts for almost 11% of the global agriculture tractor market in terms of volume. In North America the United States represents a high level of farm mechanization. The U.S. is a global leader in agriculture exports. Despite its high population density the country has more than half of its area under agricultural land covering more than 900 million acres.

The region has been increasing its production capacity to feed the ever-growing population. This increase can be attributed to the fact that the country's farmers have started to adopt farm mechanization practices and are improving their crop production by reducing the yield gap. The region has witnessed a massive increase in farm mechanization both in terms of agricultural and industrial productivity over the past four decades driven by the technological renaissance.



The government is also creating strategies to enhance the welfare of farmers by converting agriculture into a viable activity by paving the way for new machinery purchases. The awareness about advanced agriculture equipment to improve per hectare yield reduce the overall cost of crop production and increase the income-centric inclination of farmers is boosting the sale of new machinery in the country.



Key Highlights



The Agriculture Tractor Market in the country grew by 17.7% in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in crop production and tractor sales was due to favorable monsoon rains in 2020 and 2021 which helped to recover post-COVID-19 pandemic.

The Government schemes and initiatives to facilitate credit and improve agriculture-related operations are the major drivers contributing to the growth of the overall value chain.

The United States exports agricultural products to developing countries such as China where the food demand is relatively high due to its population. Therefore the farm's income in the country is relatively more robust than in other parts of the world.

In 2020 almost $4 billion worth of tractors were exported from the US accounting for nearly 8.7% of worldwide exports. Canada Australia and Germany were the top export markets for tractors in 2021.

In 2021 US-based manufacturer Solectrac announced the launch of its new 70 HP 60 kWh electric tractor. Specially designed for heavy-duty farm and vineyard operations. The machine can run for up to eight hours on a single charge with a 60-kWh battery.

Market Trends & Opportunities



Agriculture has long been a significant source of income for the country's economy and the government has been sustaining and empowering farmers. The government also launched several policies and missions to help farmers by providing them with financial assistance better infrastructure competitive crop prices loan waivers and subsidies such as USDA assistance and Agricultural loans.

The production of tractors for export accounts for a considerable share of the country. In 2020 almost $4 billion worth of tractors were exported from the US.

Increasing the number of technologically advanced tractors and implements is the solution to save money and time and increase yields. The government is keen on increasing the farm mechanization rate among farmers boosting the demand and sales of new machines and equipment.

The corporations in the country are enabling small and medium-scale farmers to buy agricultural machinery for their farms on credit. Among the agriculture machinery tractors represent more than 55% of the total machinery sold in the US.

Electric tractors are widely used in the industry for various indoor and outdoor applications. The rising trend of automation and increasing environmental concerns will accelerate growth. Farmers in developed countries are looking for these machines to reduce the cost of fuel and replace them with their standard machines.

Pulford takes over from Michael Boyle who took up a new global role earlier in 2022.

He is currently the company's Africa Vice President and Managing Director having held the position since November 2020. Pulford will start in the new role this November.

This will involve him relocating to Sydney from Johannesburg with Boyle moving to the company's Barcelona office from Australia.

Pulford's previous experience includes 14 years at Dell Technologies from 2006 to 2020. He served in multiple roles most recently Executive Director and General Manager from 2018 until his departure in 2020 when he joined HP.

In a LinkedIn post in August Boyle acknowledged his promotion.

""I've tried to put into words just how phenomenal the last four years of being the Managing Director of HP Australia and New Zealand have been. But I must admit they might not do my experience justice!"" Boyle wrote in the post.

""So much has changed in the technology industry because of how drastically our world has transformed and everything we've been through together.

""I couldn't have ever imagined that I would need to lead the business through two years of lockdowns while working from home.

""When the world slowed down team HP sped up – innovating and pivoting to give people what they need to do their best. This was only possible with a rock-star team behind me.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaXRpemVuLmNvLnphL3JhbmRmb250ZWluLWhlcmFsZC9uZXdzLWhlYWRsaW5lcy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDkvMDkvY29tcHV0ZXItaGFyZHdhcmUtY29tcGFueS1kb25hdGVzLXRvLW1vaGxha2VuZy1jaGFyaXR5L9IBjAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaXRpemVuLmNvLnphL3JhbmRmb250ZWluLWhlcmFsZC9uZXdzLWhlYWRsaW5lcy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDkvMDkvY29tcHV0ZXItaGFyZHdhcmUtY29tcGFueS1kb25hdGVzLXRvLW1vaGxha2VuZy1jaGFyaXR5L2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Computer hardware company donates to Mohlakeng charity,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.citizen.co.za/randfontein-herald/news-headlines/local-news/2022/09/09/computer-hardware-company-donates-to-mohlakeng-charity/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaXRpemVuLmNvLnphL3JhbmRmb250ZWluLWhlcmFsZC9uZXdzLWhlYWRsaW5lcy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDkvMDkvY29tcHV0ZXItaGFyZHdhcmUtY29tcGFueS1kb25hdGVzLXRvLW1vaGxha2VuZy1jaGFyaXR5L9IBjAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaXRpemVuLmNvLnphL3JhbmRmb250ZWluLWhlcmFsZC9uZXdzLWhlYWRsaW5lcy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDkvMDkvY29tcHV0ZXItaGFyZHdhcmUtY29tcGFueS1kb25hdGVzLXRvLW1vaGxha2VuZy1jaGFyaXR5L2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

SCOTTSDALE Ariz. — Editors note: The above video aired in an earlier broadcast.

Police in Scottsdale have arrested two people in connection with a shooting at a short-term rental house in Scottsdale early Friday morning.

The incident occurred in the area of East Hubbel Street in Scottsdale around 4 a.m. The shooting stemmed from an altercation over money owed to a separate victim in regard to damage to personal property.

The shooting victim was shot three times and suffered gunshot wounds to her thigh buttocks and chest. She was initially treated on scene by officers who applied tourniquets and chest seals to her wounds before she was transported to the hospital.

The woman was treated at the hospital and later released.

Scottsdale police learned that the suspects victims and witnesses met the night before at a nightclub in Phoenix. The woman staying at the home invited the suspects to the short-term rental after leaving the nightclub.

While at the home police say some personal property was damaged and an argument broke out about paying for the damages.

Later that day 24-year-old Aron D. Melvin and 23-year-old Sincere L. Hooks-Lily were arrested without incident by SWAT detectives during a traffic stop.

Both were booked on charges of attempted second-degree murder and other felony charges.

A third suspect 23-year-old Leon Morgan was a witness to the incident. He was arrested in the West Valley on charges unrelated to the shooting. Police say he has since been released.

Police have not yet released the name of the shooting victim.

Fresh off beating a 36½-point underdog in their season opener the Gophers face a 37½-point underdog in their second game. There are stylistic differences between New Mexico State which the Gophers pummeled 38-0 and Western Illinois Saturday's opponent but both face huge talent deficits vs. Minnesota.

Three big story lines

How will the Gophers handle the unknown?

Western Illinois which lost to fellow FCS member Tennessee Martin 42-25 in its opener brings an element of intrigue because it has a new coaching staff and hasn't faced the Gophers recently. The Fighting Leathernecks were picked to finish last in the Missouri Valley Conference the nation's best FCS league.

Will the Gophers open up the passing game?

Last week the Gophers stuck with their ground-and-pound attack rushing 57 times while attempting 23 passes. While they'll likely play things close to the vest in the nonconference season don't be surprised if Tanner Morgan tries a few downfield throws to get the vertical game some action.

Will the Gophers generate a pass rush?

Thomas Rush and Danny Striggow posted second-half sacks for the Gophers last week but defensive coordinator Joe Rossi wants more pressure from his line. There should be more opportunities for that to happen this week because Leathernecks QBs Nick Davenport and Henry Ogala combined to attempt 38 passes.

Two key matchups

Gophers offensive line vs. Western Illinois defensive line

Brian Callahan's charges must be licking their chops over this matchup. The Gophers are coming off a game in which they averaged 5.2 yards on their 57 rushes. The Leathernecks defense surrendered an average of 6.0 yards per carry against Tennessee Martin.

Gophers secondary vs. Western Illinois WR Naseim Brantley

Brantley was the Leathernecks' go-to receiver against Tennessee Martin catching six passes for 171 yards including TD grabs of 52 44 and 32 yards. The Gophers held New Mexico State to four completions and CB Terell Smith preserved the shutout with a fourth-quarter interception.

One stat that matters

1 The Gophers' national rank in both total defense (91 yards allowed) and time of possession (44:30) through the first week of the season. There's a strong link between those two stats.

The Gophers will win if … they resume the workmanlike approach they used against New Mexico State methodically wearing down their FCS opponent with their running game; they avoid turnovers which are the fuel of upsets; and they generate a pass rush against an opponent that will need to move through the air to have any chance at victory.

The Leathernecks will win if … Davenport the QB who gave them a second-half spark against Tennessee Martin hooks up repeatedly with wideouts Brantley and Jafar Armstrong; their defense figures out a way to fluster Morgan; and they create big-play scoring opportunities from turnovers or special teams.

Prediction

The goal for any FBS team when scheduling an FCS opponent is to administer the beating avoid tipping your hand for more important games and send the foe on its way with a paycheck for its trouble. That's what should happen Saturday.

While the Leathernecks reside in the conference that includes North Dakota State winner of nine of the past 11 FCS championships they're not at that level. Western Illinois 2-9 last year and 4-25 over the past three seasons is rebuilding under alum Myers Hendrickson who succeeded at NAIA level Kansas Wesleyan.

Expect running backs Mohamed Ibrahim and Trey Potts to carry the bulk of the load for the Gophers behind an offensive line that showed much promise in the opener. Offensive coordinator Kirk Ciarrocca might loosen the reins on Morgan a bit but don't expect 35 passes from the Gophers. On defense this week's test for Minnesota is tougher because the Leathernecks at the very least will try to pass and showed proficiency in doing so.

My expectation: Lots of body blows from the Gophers running game an occasional deep throw to keep the Leathernecks defense honest and another strong performance from Rossi's troops.

After giving up a 36-yard pass completion in the first half the Gophers safety made a diving interception on another deep ball in the second half of the 62-10 blowout of Western Illinois at Huntington Bank Stadium.

“You are going to have good and bad plays” Howden said. “The bad ones you try to shake off because you still have … more time to the game so you have to forget it.”

Howden made a tackle for loss on fourth-and-3 on Western Illinois first drive which started in Minnesota territory after a U fumble.

The Gophers were even on turnover margin Saturday after being plus-one in the 38-0 win over New Mexico State last week.

Howden had two previous career interceptions but Saturday’s was his first since the 2019 season.

Scoreboard approved

The University of Minnesota Board of Regents on Thursday approved the purchase and installation of a $5.7 million scoreboard for Huntington Bank Stadium before the 2023 football season.

The regents’ finance and operations committee had eight votes in favor no votes against two absences and one abstention. Regent Darrin Rosha abstained seeking more clarity on the financial component.

The Gophers athletics department must repay a $21.5 million loan from the university to bridge a budget hole from the COVID-19 pandemic plus an estimated $40 million in remaining debt on the Athletes Village project.

The Gophers are expecting a huge influx of media revenue annually with the Big Ten Conference expanding to 14 teams with the high-profile additions of Southern Cal and UCLA in 2024.

Happy for Jelen

Receiver Chris Autman-Bell was cheering loudly when Presten Jelen scored on a 30-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter. After Jelen tore his ACL last August he and Autman-Bell worked out together in the offseason.

“That one hit the heart” Autman-Bell said. “… Seeing a guy like Presten Jelen working his butt off all year since this winter and finally getting his change … I was happy.”

First for Kaliakmanis

Second-year quarterback Athan Kaliakmanis completed all three of his passes for 67 yards and scored his first career touchdown on a 1-yard run in the third quarter. Gophers defenders were not surprised.

“Athan is the future of the program” former U cornerback Coney Durr tweeted Saturday of the team’s backup QB. “I will never forget the day he torched the (starting) defense last year as the scout team QB.”

Howden backed it up. “I forgot what practice it was but he was dropping them in like every rep we had” he said. “You can tell that he is getting very mature; that is something that you need to do especially at the quarterback position.”

Briefly

After allowing only 33 plays to New Mexico State last week Minnesota’s defense gave up 51 against Western Illinois. Gophers head coach P.J. Fleck said it felt like fewer. … The 10 points allowed through two games are the fewest in the first two games since 1999. … After having 10 pass catchers in the opener Minnesota spread it around to eight with 10 targeted. … Fleck gave a shoutout to women’s basketball coach Lindsay Whalen for her induction into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame this weekend. … Saturday was the Gophers’ Mental Health Awareness Game.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGFydHJpYnVuZS5jb20vbWFyay1jb3lsZS1hZGRyZXNzZXMtZ29waGVycy1idWRnZXQtYWZ0ZXItcmVnZW50cy1hcHByb3ZlLTUtNy1taWxsaW9uLWZvb3RiYWxsLXNjb3JlYm9hcmQvNjAwMjA1Mzg3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mark Coyle addresses Gophers' budget after regents approve $5.7 million football scoreboard,"On a day University regents approved a $5.7 million football video board Gophers athletic director Mark Coyle made his annual presentation to the board Friday sharing the department's full financial picture.

Coyle noted that the Gophers broke even with their operating budget of $123.6 million for the 2022 fiscal year but they still have to pay back a $21.5 million pandemic loan to the university. He also cited the long-term debt repayment plan to cover nearly $15 million of renovations for ice plants at 3M Arena at Mariucci and Ridder Arena.

Along with the pandemic loan football scoreboard costs and ice plant loans Coyle said between $2 million and $2.5 million will go toward the Gophers' new ""Champions for Life"" program which can pay athletes up to $5980 per year for academic related financial support.

With the Big Ten's historic multi-billion media rights deal announced last month the Gophers will see a significant future financial boost from the conference which is adding USC and UCLA in 2023-24.

Some U regents had questions about where money for that massive TV deal would be used by the Gophers. Coyle said his department wouldn't truly see major help from that until 2024-25.

""The landscape is changing daily"" Coyle told the regents. ""We need to have those resources available to help us remain competitive not only in the Big Ten but nationally.""

While Gophers football has made progress under P.J. Fleck Coyle's administration noted in a proposal letter to the board that the stadium has its original scoreboard installed before the facility's opening in 2009. The new one will be in place for next season.

Typically outdoor LED video boards last for 10 years the proposal noted and the ones at the stadium have become noticeably dimmer worn and washed out. Replacement parts no longer are produced for the existing display.

""I understand the video boards look nice and they work but we're being told by our internal people and our outside people that those video boards could go down at any second'' Coyle said. ""So we have to allocate money to put in new boards and enhance that experience for our fans.''

Daktronics of Brookings S.D. will be paid $5728430 for the project which will be funded by donations sponsorships and short-term debt through the university.

The football scoreboard will be the second phase of a three-phase project which started with the replacing of control room equipment. The third phase with a timeline to be determined would replace digital displays in other athletics facilities including Williams Arena and 3M Arena at Mariucci.

During a Thursday committee meeting Regent Darrin Rosha raised concerns over the specifics on funding especially in light of the elimination of three men's sports and the loss of revenue brought on by COVID-19. ""To me it feels a little aggressive from a financial standpoint'' he said.

The project was part of a group of consent items that required board approval because they are goods and services costing $1 million or more. The committee voted 8-0-1 to approve with Rosha abstaining.

Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly said the Gophers' ""Champions for Life"" program was for name image and likeness (NIL). It is a program under an NCAA rule change that allows schools to pay athletes up to $5980 per year for education-related financial support.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9nb3BoZXJzLW9mZmVuc2UtZGVmZW5zZS1yb2xsLWluLTYyLTEwLXJvbXAtb3Zlci13ZXN0ZXJuLWlsbGlub2lzLzYwMDIwNTYxNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gophers offense defense roll in 62-10 romp over Western Illinois,"If ever you feel that your job is too physically demanding just think about what poor Goldy Gopher went through Saturday.

A routine for the University of Minnesota mascot during football games is pumping out as many pushups as the Gophers have points each time they score. So on Saturday at Huntington Bank Stadium Goldy had to do a whole bunch of pushups — 353 to be exact — as the Gophers administered a 62-10 drubbing of Western Illinois an overmatched team that plays at the FCS level.

""I hope Goldy's super strong'' Gophers wide receiver Chris Autman-Bell said. ""Shout out to Goldy. He did his thing today.''

Goldy wasn't the only one doing his thing.

Mohamed Ibrahim rushed 23 times for 130 yards and two touchdowns Trey Potts carried 10 times for 79 yards and two scores and Tanner Morgan completed 14 of 18 passes for 287 yards and a TD as the Gophers improved to 2-0. Autman-Bell also chipped in with five catches for 118 yards in front of an announced crowd of 43859.

Minnesota surpassed 600 yards of offense for the first time since Sept. 4 2004 when it had 704 in a 63-22 rout of Toledo. The Gophers surpassed 60 points for the first time since a 62-26 victory over Indiana on Nov. 4 2006.

The defense was stout too holding the Fighting Leathernecks to 35 rushing yards eight first downs and 3.8 yards per play. Defensive coordinator Joe Rossi's charges forced Western Illinois (0-2) into seven three-and-outs and one four-and-out.

Gophers coach P.J. Fleck called the Sept. 1 season-opening 38-0 victory over New Mexico State ""workmanlike'' and Saturday's effort got a ""workmanlike-squared'' label from Fleck who added ""We did what we were supposed to do.''

Playing an FCS team that was 2-9 last year that meant scoring early and often. After an opening-series fumble lost by wide receiver Mike Brown-Stephens the Gophers offense scored on 10 consecutive possessions — four TDs and a field goal to take a 31-3 halftime lead. They added four TDs and a field goal in the second half.

""It's not like a hidden formula or science'' Morgan said. ""It's throughout the week communicating when you're watching film and understanding how we want to attack it.''

For Leathernecks coach Myers Hendrickson Saturday's game became an exercise in picking your poison. He could play a conventional defense hoping Ibrahim and Potts wouldn't ground and pound his team into submission. Or he could sell out against the run and daring Morgan and offensive coordinator Kirk Ciarrocca to win the game through the air.

Neither was a viable option as the evidence shows:

On the Gophers' first TD drive a mix of eight passes and five runs led to Ibrahim's 1-yard TD plunge.

The next TD drive saw Morgan hit Autman-Bell for 15 yards and Brown-Stephens for 35 before Potts finished it with a 15-yard run.

The third Gophers TD came on a march that had 11 runs in 12 plays for a 21-3 lead.

To make it 28-3 Morgan and Autman-Bell had connections of 17 15 and 54 yards on a 96-yard drive that ended with Potts' 2-yard TD run.

""We were taking what the defense would give us and it was a little bit more of a mixing and matching'' Fleck said comparing the Leathernecks defensive approach to what another FCS team South Dakota State did to frustrate the Gophers in a tight Minnesota win in 2019. ""… They were throwing everything at us.''

The Gophers though had the answers and that continued in the second half when Ibrahim gained 58 yards on five carries on one march and scored from the 1 to make it 38-3.

Set up by safety Jordan Howden's third-quarter interception Morgan found a wide-open tight end Brevyn Spann-Ford for a 45-yard TD connection and 45-3 lead with 9:07 left in the quarter.

From there Fleck rested Morgan Ibrahim and Co. with only the final score left to settle.

With wins over New Mexico State and Western Illinois the Gophers aren't about to throw a parade. The strength of opponent should ramp up next week with a visit from Colorado. Fleck though credited his team for its approach against opponents that were a combined 4-19.

""It's being confident that you can go out there and execute the game plan and be trusted. That's what tough is'' he said. ""And they've just got to keep getting tougher.''"

Huntington Ingalls Industries’ (HII) Ingalls Shipbuilding division has commenced fabrication of the US Navy’s amphibious transport dock ship the future USS Pittsburgh (LPD 31).

The start of the work on LPD 31 was marked by the cutting of the first 100t of steel on 7 September.

Programme Executive Office (PEO) Ships Amphibious Warfare Programme Office programme manager Cedric McNeal said: “We are proud to have the future USS Pittsburgh under construction the fifth ship to bear the name.

“With this ship we will continue to honour the legacy of the great city of Pittsburgh and the state of Pennsylvania.”

LPD 31 is the fifth vessel to bear this name. The first vessel was an ironclad gunboat USS Pittsburgh that served during the American Civil War.

The future USS Pittsburgh is the second San Antonio-class vessel to have landing platform dock (LPD) Flight II production configuration.

Chelmsford developer Salvatore Lupoli plans to transform the 41-acre property at 550 King St. from an aged office park to a mixed-use project containing up to 780 units of multi-family housing (including 78 affordable units) retail restaurant commercial office and manufacturing space.

In March The Engineering Corp (TEC) submitted plans on behalf of Lupoli to the Littleton Planning Board for a special permit which the board unanimously approved in June. The project will be built in three phases over five years with construction expected to begin this year.

Right now the property consists of a parking lot and two three-story brick office buildings which the developer will attempt to re-use but may ultimately demolish. The historic Tuttle House at the south end of the site will be preserved along with its neighboring pear orchard and mature trees on the property.

King Street Commons will include 12 new buildings ranging from two-story retail/commercial space to a five-story residential building. There will also be four parking structures in addition to on-street and parking lots creating a total of 2188 parking spaces.

The planning board's approval comes just six months after Town Meeting members voted in favor of adopting the King Street Common Zoning District which changed allowed uses to include multi-family residential and apartment options office research and development restaurant and medical services.

The zoning changes disallowed large-scale warehousing and distribution which were previously allowed at the site and also prohibited drive-throughs except for banks.

The project will connect to the town's sewer system with the cost being split between the developer and the town. The town's municipal sewer extension project is expected to be complete in 2024. The project is located within the town's water aquifer district making water quality a top concern.

But reaching these frontiers is no small feat — typically it requires building all-new apparatuses that push the limits of modern technology. That’s why we built the world’s largest dilution refrigerator by experimental volume.

The super-fridge — internally known as project Goldeneye — is a proof-of-concept for a dilution refrigerator capable of cooling future generations of quantum experiments. Today’s dilution refrigerators are limited in a number of ways: the size of the quantum physics experiments we can fit inside them; the number of input/output ports; their cooling power. Goldeneye may not be slated for use with any of the IBM Quantum processors we’re developing today but building it taught us important lessons on how to overcome these challenges.

Goldeneye is a testament to the fact that a small team of people armed with passion and dedication can move a seven-ton “mountain” of steel and electronics. The super-fridge contains 1.7 cubic meters’ worth of experimental volume meaning it can cool a volume larger than three home kitchen refrigerators to temperatures colder than the outer space versus previous fridges which are in the range of 0.4-0.7 cubic meters.

These temperatures are required for performing state-of-the-art physics experiments and potentially running large quantum processors.

Today we’re excited to announce the culmination of Project Goldeneye’s mission: we successfully cooled it to operating temperature (~25 mK) and wired a quantum processor inside. Goldeneye will soon move to our IBM Quantum Computation Center in Poughkeepsie NY where the team will be exploring large scale cryogenic systems to best develop the cooling needs of tomorrow’s quantum data centers such as the Bluefors Kide platform under development for use with IBM Quantum System Two. We hope that its innovative design with an eye toward ease-of-use will inspire the next generation of vacuum and low temperature refrigeration technologies.

How to build the world’s largest coldest fridge

Studying and controlling quantum effects requires that we have access to the temperature regime where the effects are most visible — temperatures close to those at which there is zero energy called 0 Kelvin (K) or absolute zero. Dilution refrigerators are experimental cryogenic devices that cool a space volume to the milli-Kelvin (mK) regime using a mixture of two helium isotopes called helium-3 (He-3) and helium-4 (He-4).

Dilution refrigerators perform this cooling by using a number of steps to remove heat from the helium isotope mixture and then use vacuum pumps to circulate and dilute He-3 into the He-3/He-4 mixture until a target temperature is reached. Until recently all dilution refrigerators were “wet” systems requiring already-cold substances like liquid nitrogen and other cryogenic fluids to begin the cooling. Today’s fridges are more commonly “dry” employing a mechanical component called a cryo-cooler to provide the initial 50 K and 4 K temperatures for pre-cooling the helium mixture.

These are advanced pieces of machinery and thus challenging to scale. Project Goldeneye features an all-new construction of the frame and cryostat — the main barrel-shaped component responsible for the cooling — to maximize experimental volume while reducing noise and achieving the temperatures required for cooling experimental quantum hardware. The design is modular which made prototyping assembly and disassembly a much easier lift for just a team of four IBM engineers. Other large dilution refrigerators may require larger cranes and a dozen or more technicians for assembly and disassembly.

The cryostat also features a clamshell design allowing the outer vacuum chamber to open sideways and eliminating the need to remove the entire external shell to access the hardware inside. Most dilution refrigerators in use today require a team of operators to function properly but Goldeneye’s fully automated system includes a specially designed jib crane that could one day allow even a single person to run the fridge — which can be monitored remotely with the help of an open-source visualization platform.

The inside of the cryostat features the ability to install a set of 10 internal plates for mounting components in its top and bottom half: five “regular” units on top and five inverted units on the bottom. It can also hold up to six individual dilution refrigerator units enabling close to ~10 mW at 100 mK cooling power and over 24 W of cooling power at 4 K temperatures. Finally the weight of the entire system — 6.7 metric tons — also helps dampen vibrations reducing the need for other commonly used dampening techniques.

Most importantly it works. After just three years from project inception to our recent 25 mK milestone we were able to perform one final characterization exercise: we put a qubit chip inside.

This test demonstrated the performance of Goldeneye through the eyes of a qubit by measuring qubit frequencies and coherence times — how long they can retain quantum information. We were able to reproduce coherence times of around 450 microseconds similar to those measured on other commercial dilution refrigeration systems. We did not observe a decrease in the qubit’s performance despite the different internal environment and much larger experimental volume.

And despite its size Goldeneye is efficient. It requires less space than present-day large-scale dilution refrigerators in order to accommodate an equivalent amount of quantum hardware. It would require 10 times the lab space to deploy equivalent hardware in today’s state-of-the-art fridges.

We don’t know if the fridges used to cool future quantum computers will actually be this large. IBM Quantum System Two which we will deploy next year will first be realized with Bluefors’ Kide cryogenic platform a smaller modular system that we anticipate will allow us to already connect multiple processors together through 2025. However having access to Goldeneye allows us to consider many different ways of scaling up our quantum processors even beyond 2025 and will help us further conceptualize the cryogenic infrastructure of tomorrow’s quantum data centers.

Most importantly every time we push a technological boundary we learn something new. By simply constructing Goldeneye our team has tested the limits of cryogenic science while teaching us what kinds of large-scale quantum experiments may soon be feasible. The lessons learned from this project will likely go towards a future IBM Quantum System Three as we continue to chart the course of quantum for the world.

Can you imagine the size of the light bulb for this thing?

IBM researchers report in a team blog post they created the world’s largest dilution refrigerator — by experimental volume — designed for deep science projects like quantum computing. It’s a proof-of-concept super-fridge which the team nicknamed “Goldeneye” and the researchers are hoping it may one day handle some of the most precise scientific explorations that have ever been conceptualized.

The super-fridge contains 1.7 cubic meters’ worth of experimental volume. That size could cool a volume larger than three home kitchen refrigerators to temperatures colder than the outer space according to the post. Previous fridges are in the range of 0.4-0.7 cubic meters.

Because studying and controlling quantum effects requires temperatures where those effects can be best seen and measured most quantum experiments — and running quantum processors such as the ones IBM has designed — need to take place in incredibly cold environments. Creating and preserving these conditions — where temperatures are so low that there is almost zero energy — is an imaginably precise and complex operation.

The post written by Pat Gumann and Jerry Chow states: “We create knowledge by exploring reality’s frontiers: we study the coldest the furthest the lowest and highest energies and the smallest things in the universe. But reaching these frontiers is no small feat — typically it requires building all-new apparatuses that push the limits of modern technology. That’s why we built the world’s largest dilution refrigerator by experimental volume.”

IBM is building the device to learn how to overcome certain restrictions of today’s dilution refrigerators according to the post.

“We create knowledge by exploring reality’s frontiers: we study the coldest the furthest the lowest and highest energies and the smallest things in the universe.”

“Today’s dilution refrigerators are limited in a number of ways: the size of the quantum physics experiments we can fit inside them; the number of input/output ports; their cooling power” the researchers write.

The payoff might not come today and the researchers indicate Goldeneye isn’t ready for IBM’s current quantum processors but building it taught us important lessons on how to overcome these challenges.

Dilution refrigerators cool a space volume to the milli-Kelvin (mK) regime using a mixture of two helium isotopes called helium-3 (He-3) and helium-4 (He-4).

“The design is modular which made prototyping assembly and disassembly a much easier lift for just a team of four IBM engineers. Other large dilution refrigerators may require larger cranes and a dozen or more technicians for assembly and disassembly.”

The researchers explain Goldeneye’s unique design:

“Project Goldeneye features an all-new construction of the frame and cryostat — the main barrel-shaped component responsible for the cooling — to maximize experimental volume while reducing noise and achieving the temperatures required for cooling experimental quantum hardware. The design is modular which made prototyping assembly and disassembly a much easier lift for just a team of four IBM engineers.

“It would require 10 times the lab space to deploy equivalent hardware in today’s state-of-the-art fridges.”

The device works too. The researchers performed one final characterization exercise by placing a qubit chip inside the device.

We were able to reproduce coherence times of around 450 microseconds similar to those measured on other commercial dilution refrigeration systems.

The team credits IBM teamwork and scientific passion for creating Goldeneye.

The cryostat also has a clamshell design which enables the exterior vacuum chamber to open horizontally and eliminates the requirement for removing the whole external shell to reach the inside components.

A specially designed jib crane within the system could one day allow even a single person to run the fridge. Plus it can be monitored remotely with the help of an open-source visualization platform.

Five “normal” units on top and five “inverted” units on the bottom of the cryostat’s interior can be installed as ten internal plates for attaching components in its top and bottom halves. Additionally it may accommodate up to six separate dilution refrigerator units allowing for chilling capacities of over 24 W at 4 K and up to 10 mW at 100 mK temperatures. Finally the system’s weight of 6.7 metric tonnes reduces the need for additional dampening methods by helping to dampen vibrations.

Researchers at ARM and IBM have developed a 14nm analog compute in memory chip for low power always on machine learning.

These always-on perception tasks in IoT applications dubbed TinyML require very high energy efficiency. Analog compute-in-memory (CiM) using non-volatile memory (NVM) promises high energy efficiency and self-contained on-chip model storage.

However analog CiM introduces new practical challenges including conductance drift read/write noise fixed analog-to-digital (ADC) converter gain etc. These must be addressed to achieve models that can be deployed on analog CiM with acceptable accuracy loss.

Researchers from ARM and IBM Research Zurich looked at the TinyML models for the popular always-on tasks of keyword spotting (KWS) and visual wake words (VWW). The model architectures are specifically designed for analog CiM and detail a comprehensive training methodology to retain accuracy in the face of analog issues and low-precision data converters at inference time.

They developed a programmable minimal-area phase-change memory (PCM) analog CiM accelerator called AON-CiM on a 14nm process technology. This has series of layers remove the cost of complex interconnects associated with a fully-pipelined design.

Evaluating the analog networks on a calibrated simulator as well as real hardware showed that accuracy degradation is limited to 0.8%/1.2% after 24 hours of PCM drift (8-bit). Running the nets on 14 nm AON-CiM accelerator demonstrate 8.55/26.55/56.67 and 4.34/12.64/25.2 TOPS/W for keyword-spotting (KWS) and visual-wake-words (VWW) with 8/6/4-bit activations respectively.

“Analog Compute-in-memory techniques may be a good fit for ultra low-power TinyMLperception tasks such as keyword spotting and visual wakewords in edge computing applications” said Paul Whatmough Head of Machine Learning Research at ARM research in the US

“Our paper in collaboration with the amazing IBM Research Zurich team gives a deep dive on the co-design of machine learning model and analog hardware covering model design and training for noisy hardware as well as compact efficient (and practical) hardware for layer-serial compute in memory. We even test the models on real hardware.”

This is a multi-site field study to determine the present community of cat (Felis catus) ectoparasite species (ticks and fleas) and vector-borne pathogens. Preferably 50 ectoparasite-infested cats per country (Ghana Kenya Nigeria Tanzania Uganda and Namibia) were sampled in both urban and rural areas (Fig. 1). Urban areas are described as cities with a high population (> 20000 inhabitants) with extensive housing infrastructure (mainly offices and markets) a well-developed transportation network and access to municipal water contemporary housing and electricity. Rural areas are defined as having a sparse population. The housing and infrastructure are poor; municipal water is scarce with no electricity and hardly any access to public transport. The focus is on agricultural activities and cats hardly receive veterinary care. Cats of all countries were sampled and treated during the rainy season except for Namibia (see Additional file 1: Fig. S1 for the timing of sampling).

Fig. 1 Overview of the sampling locations in the six African countries (Ghana Kenya Nigeria Tanzania Uganda and Namibia). Location points in blue and red indicate rural and urban habitats respectively Full size image

In Ghana the two regions that were sampled are the Greater Accra region (GAR) in the south of the country and in the Ashanti region Akumadan. In the GAR samples were retrieved from private veterinary clinics in Accra (East Legon Haatso-Atomic Dome Madina) and Tema metropolis. In Akumadan the areas from where the cats originated were Nkwakwaa Asempanaye Asuosuo and Afrancho. These are defined as rural and agricultural zones with moist semi-deciduous forests and thick vegetation cover with undergrowth. In Kenya cats were sampled in Nairobi (the capital city) and Mombasa (a coastal urban town). These animals were well maintained and were provided housing decent welfare and veterinary care. In Narok defined as a rural area and pastoral area cats lived among livestock with likely contact with wild animals. In Uganda the two urban areas were focused within the capital Kampala and Wakiso district in central Uganda whereas the two rural areas were in Mbarara and Iganga municipalities which are located in the western and eastern regions of Uganda respectively. Most of the cats in Wakiso and Kampala were well groomed well fed well treated and confined in fenced houses although they could roam occasionally. On the contrary cats in the rural areas which were kept particularly to keep vermin (mice and rats) at bay roamed freely interacting with other pets and with livestock and wildlife. In Nigeria the samples were taken from two urban and two rural settings in each of the North Central and Southwest geopolitical divisions of Nigeria. In the rural areas farmers hardly had access to facilities for their use. In Tanzania the region of Morogoro was selected as an urban area and the region between Morogoro and Dar es Salaam the capital as a rural area. In Namibia the area between Walvisbaai and Hettiesbaai was taken for both urban and rural areas with urban sites more situated in the center of the cities and rural more inland. This area is located in the eastern part of the country bordering the Atlantic Ocean.

To obtain the support of owners to commit animals for sampling free rabies vaccination to companion animals and free ectoparasite preventive treatment for both cats and dogs were offered. During the field study the owners’ consent was obtained and field assessment also involved obtaining details on animal sampled physical examinations scoring of tick-predilection sites and sampling of ectoparasites and blood. Laboratory assessments included analyses of field samples related to ectoparasite species (ticks fleas) and vector-borne parasite identification. Sample equipment data forms and IDEXX tests (see below) were made available to the sampling teams. The molecular analyses of blood samples spotted on FTA cards ectoparasite species and vector-borne pathogens were performed centrally in a single lab (Clinomics Bloemfontein South Africa). Interpretation of the IDEXX kits was performed locally.

Inclusion criteria

In urban areas a link with a veterinary practice was established by each investigator. Samples were taken from privately owned cats visiting the veterinarian. In rural areas where most cats were likely free-roaming and/or community-owned cats sampling was performed based on the rabies vaccination/ectoparasite control provision for dogs where cats were also presented. No sampling was performed at animal shelters. There were also no restrictions on breed or age. For each enrolled cat age sex weight body condition score (5-point scale: very thin underweight ideal overweight obese) housing (free-roaming yard indoor) parasiticide treatment (ectoparasiticide and deworming drugs) and presence of other cats or dogs were recorded using a standardized data capture form (see Additional file 2: capture form).

Ectoparasite burden assessment and collection

For each cat seven different body areas were systematically screened for ticks. For each body area a burden score was assigned (0: absent 1–2: one and two ticks respectively > 3: three or more ticks). A cumulative number of ticks per individual cat was created (the scores of all body areas were summed) and for statistical analyses three categories were created for the ""No"" (cumulative number: 0) ""Moderate infestation"" (0–2 ticks) and ""High infestation"" (> 2). Secondly for fleas the whole body was screened without recording details of the collection site. An estimate for the entire animal was obtained as follows: ""No"" (0 fleas) ""Light infestation"" (1–10 fleas) ""Moderate infestation"" (11–50 fleas) and ""Severe infestation"" (> 50 fleas). Up to 14 ticks were collected from each animal and placed into a plastic tube with a screw cap containing 70% ethanol. All fleas were collected from the cat and placed together with the ticks into the same collection container (i.e. one container per animal).

Blood collection and processing

A syringe and appropriate needle were used to collect whole blood samples. Blood was spotted on an FTA card (Whatman®) on which blood was preserved for DNA analyses. IDEXX 4Dx Plus Test kits were used to screen the serum for Ehrlichia canis/Ehrlichia ewingii Anaplasma phagocytophilum/Ehrlichia platys Borrelia burgdorferi and Dirofilaria immitis following the manufacturer’s manual. For the serum preparation plain collection tubes were centrifuged after the blood had clotted. The remaining serum was frozen at − 20 °C in plastic screw-cap tubes and stored for future research.

Vector-borne pathogen identification

FTA card technology was used to ship blood samples. Cards were punched (3 × 5 mm diameter punches) for DNA isolation. Per cat five ticks (or < 5 if fewer ticks were collected) and five fleas (or < 5 if fewer fleas were found) were randomly sampled from the container for molecular identification using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Ticks and fleas from each individual cat were pooled separately for DNA isolation. These samples were homogenized by bead-bashing before processing using the MagMAX™ DNA Multi-Sample Ultra Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s specifications and eluted with 100 µl elution buffer.

Blood samples ticks and fleas were then screened for the presence of the most common tick- and flea-borne pathogens using PCR techniques: Babesia rossi Babesia canis Babesia felis Bartonella henselae E. canis Ehrlichia chaffeensis Anaplasma platys A. phagocytophilum Rickettsia conorii Rickettsia africae Rickettsia felis Coxiella burnetti Hepatozoon canis and Mycoplasma haemofelis. Blood samples were also screened for a mosquito-borne (D. immitis) pathogen.

The isolated DNA (5 µl) served as template in 15 µl hydrolysis probe-based multiplex quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay reactions using Luna® Universal Probe qPCR Master Mix (New England Biolabs) to detect the target of interest according to the host (feline blood) and sample type (ticks fleas). A universal thermal cycling program was used which entailed a polymerase activation step at 95 °C for 3 min followed by 45 cycles consisting of 15 s at 95 °C for denaturation and 30 s at 60 °C for elongation for all multiplexes excluding the Dipylidium caninum complex which had an extended elongation time of 60 s due to the longer expected amplicon size. The targets and their respective DNA templates are indicated in Table 1 and different multiplex reactions are in Additional file 1: Table S1.

Table 1 Overview of the targets and their respective DNA templates used in multiplex qPCR assay screening Full size table

A first-round screening was performed on all extracted DNA samples using a positive extraction control to assess DNA isolation and an internal amplification control to assess template-derived inhibition of the PCR. For those samples where neither the internal amplification control nor any other targets were detected they were diluted 1:1 using 10% Chelex (Bio-Rad laboratories). The results were analyzed using QuantStudio™ Real-Time PCR Software to identify samples with detectable levels of target DNA. All qPCR runs included a DNA-negative extraction control a host-negative control indicating that the assays did not detect host DNA a no-template control and a positive control.

The design of the primers and probes (H. canis D. immitis and B. felis) was performed using Geneious (http://www.geneious.com/) and validated in silico using sequence data available on GenBank (Table 2).

Vector identification

Ectoparasites were only identified molecularly. PCR was performed using Q5® Hot Start High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix in 10 µl reactions containing 2 µl of tick/flea isolated DNA using primers 5′-AAAGATGACCAAACTTGATCATTTAGAGG-3 and 5′-TCGATGAAGAACGCAGCCAGCT-3′ at a final concentration of 500 nM each which amplifies the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) region of the ticks and fleas. Thermal cycling involved a polymerase activation step at 98 °C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles consisting of the following: 98 °C for 10 s 65 °C for 20 s and 72 °C for 75 s followed by a final extension step at 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR products were sequenced and analyzed using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) for identification.

For those ticks which could not be identified using this sequenced region primers which amplified the 16S ribosomal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the ticks were used [4]. The reactions were executed using Platinum™ SuperFi II PCR Master Mix in 10 µl reactions containing 2 µl of tick-isolated DNA with the primers at 500 nM final concentration each. Thermal cycling entailed a polymerase activation step at 98 °C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles consisting of the following: 98 °C for 10 s 60 °C for 45 s and 72 °C for 30 s followed by a final extension step at 72 °C for 5 min.

The newly generated sequences were submitted to GenBank under accession numbers OP143941-OP143962 for the tick and flea species identified (Ctenocephalis felis R. sanguineus Haemaphysalis leachi H. spinulosa Rhipicentor nuttalli).

Statistical analysis

The proportions of infested cats per ectoparasite taxon and their infestation intensities were compared between countries (Ghana Kenya Nigeria Tanzania Uganda and Namibia) and urbanization level (urban vs. rural) as well as the proportion of pathogen-infected ectoparasite batches. We highlight that for each country urban and rural locations are different (see descriptions above) meaning that a generalized continent-wide comparison of ""urban versus rural"" has little epidemiological relevance. For this purpose generalized estimation equation models (GEE) were fitted to the data [5] which take into account the statistical dependence of observations in the same areas. The residuals for burden categories and pathogen proportions were assumed to follow a binomial distribution (logit-link in ordinal and logistic regression respectively). For the statistical comparison of the parasite community Fisher’s exact tests were executed whereby the species distribution (in the population of parasitized individuals) was compared between habitat types (urban vs. rural) and countries. In addition the Shannon diversity index was computed [6]. All prevalence estimates are reported as mean ± standard error. All data management and statistical analyses were done in SAS v 9.3 (SAS Institute Cary NC USA).",,,,,,,,,,,,
ITW,Illinois Tool Works,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVnbG9iZWFuZG1haWwuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy9tYXJrZXRzL3N0b2Nrcy9DQVQtTi9wcmVzc3JlbGVhc2VzLzEwMTE0MzEyL2Rvd24tYmV0d2Vlbi0xOC1hbmQtMzctMy10b3AtZGl2aWRlbmQtc3RvY2tzLXRoYXQtYXJlLXBhc3NpdmUtaW5jb21lLW1hY2hpbmVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Down Between 18% and 37%: 3 Top Dividend Stocks That Are Passive Income Machines,"After a scorching rebound between roughly mid-June and mid-August the broader stock market has taken a turn as the economy begins to show signs of weakening. But there's no need to panic.

Long-term investors are no strangers to economic cycles. And in many ways economic cycles are simply par for the course when it comes to investing over a multidecade time period.

Illinois Tool Works(NYSE: ITW) Caterpillar(NYSE: CAT) and Celanese(NYSE: CE) are three dividend stocks that are down big off their highs. Here's what makes each a great buy now.

Illinois Tool Works is a regal dividend choice despite its recent dip

Scott Levine (Illinois Tool Works): Illinois Tool Works is a Dividend King -- a member of the S&P 500 index that has raised its dividend for 50 consecutive years or more. Despite their royal stature shares of Illinois Tool Works -- and their forward dividend yield of 2.7% -- have fallen out of favor with investors as shares of Illinois Tool Works are down 18% from their all-time high.

It's important to recognize though that the stock's decline through 2022 isn't indicative of some catastrophe that the company has suffered. In fact the drop in Illinois Tool Works' stock isn't much steeper than the near-17% plunge the S&P 500 has experienced. Instead the stock's fall seems to be a result of the overall bearish sentiment that has pervaded the market over the past few months as fears of an economic downturn and inflation weigh heavily on investors' minds.

But this isn't Illinois Tool Works' first rodeo. With a history of increasing its dividend to shareholders for more than 50 years Illinois Tool Works has experience with negotiating the turbulent waters of recessions military conflicts and periods of inflation before -- all the while continuing to reward shareholders with a higher dividend.



Despite the headwinds facing Illinois Tool Works (and the market writ large) management remains bullish on the company's future. During its recent second-quarter 2022 earnings report management projected the company will generate revenue of $15.4 billion to $15.8 billion in 2022. Should it achieve the midpoint of this guidance it will represent year-over-year sales growth of 7.6%. Additionally management forecasts Illinois Tool Works will generate free cash flow between 85% and 95% of net income -- an auspicious sign that suggests the company remains well positioned to continue hiking the dividend in the near term.

No ordinary cyclical downturn

Daniel Foelber (Caterpillar): Caterpillar stock has been under pressure lately (down 26% from its all-time high) as investors reevaluate how the business would perform if economic growth slows. But the story isn't as simple as past business cycles.

It's no secret that Caterpillar's earnings ebb and flow with the broader economy. Global growth tends to translate to increased demand for industrial output whether that's through infrastructure spending construction agriculture energy transportation or mining equipment.

Unfortunately the economy seems on pace for a period of slowing growth. Rising interest rates increase borrowing costs which makes it harder to expand as quickly. Rising interest rates are undoubtedly a headwind for Caterpillar.

The Federal Reserve is raising interest rates to cool the economy off and bring inflation down. However Caterpillar's residential construction business and its energy and transportation division have benefited from their strong end markets. Under normal conditions an economic slowdown could result in declining earnings for Caterpillar. What's different about this inflation-driven slowdown is that higher energy costs are a key contributor to inflation. If oil and gas prices remain high for some time that could spur a multiyear growth cycle in oil and gas as Caterpillar's customers upgrade their fleets.

Despite this mixed bag it's unclear how Caterpillar's business is going to perform in the short term after its record 2021. If global growth is worse than expected oil and gas demand will fall which could bring down prices even if supply remains constrained. The same goes for construction and commodities related to mining. Regardless of the short-term situation Caterpillar remains the market leader in many of the industries it serves which positions it for long-term growth. In the meantime Caterpillar stock has a 2.6% dividend yield and has paid and raised its dividend for 27 consecutive years -- making it a reliable source of passive income no matter how the economy is doing.

A Warren Buffett stock pick

Lee Samaha(Celanese): This chemicals stock is down 37% from its all-time high trades on just 6.2 times estimated earnings for 2022 and is owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. So what's not to like about the stock?

There are a few things. For example earnings may be fantastic this year but no one likes to buy a cyclical stock just when its end markets turn down. Celanese makes intermediate chemicals used across a swath of industries with household and consumer spending exposure. That's great when the economy is in growth mode and the price of its acetyl chain products (including acetic acid) is soaring but not so good when they move the other way.

The low valuation of Celanese's stock indicates that the market thinks acetic acid prices will slump further. It's been a lousy summer for the chemicals industry with the prices of polyethylene polypropylene and polyvinyl all crashing in the last few months.

That said Buffett rarely buys stocks for the here and now. Celanese has much long-term potential due to its position as a low-cost producer and synergy opportunities from the deal to buy DuPont's mobility and materials business.

Moreover a quick look at Celanese's history of cash flow generation suggests its dividend (yielding 2.3% at present) will be easily covered. So while the near-term risk is obvious Celanese will likely reward investors over the long term.

Want an exciting summer internship? Looking for employment after graduation? Then make plans to attend Mizzou Engineering’s Fall 2022 Career Fair from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Thursday Sept. 22 at MizzouRec.

“Even if you’re not sure what you want to do this is a great opportunity to explore internship and post-graduation options” said Anh Nguyen career services coordinator. “Hiring managers from some of the top companies and engineering firms in the country are coming to campus because they want to meet with students and hear about their interests and professional aspirations. This is really a chance to network with leaders in the field.”

More than 220 employers are attending this year’s Career Fair including representatives from industries such as Burns & McDonnell ARCO Garmin Emerson and Tradebot and governmental agencies such as the Missouri Department of Transportation and U.S. Armed Forces.

“These companies are very interested in hiring Mizzou Engineers because they know our students have had or are going to have incredible leadership and research experiences and are getting a top-notch engineering education that teaches both foundational skills and technical know-how” Nguyen said. “CEOs and hiring managers often tell us they’re looking for well-rounded individuals who have had experiences both within and outside of engineering. They know Mizzou graduates will exceed their expectations.”

While Mizzou Engineering’s is the largest career fair on campus it’s not the only one engineering students can attend. The Trulaske College of Business College of Agriculture Food and Natural Resources School of Health Professions and other colleges and schools on campus also host career fairs that allow engineering students to explore internship and employment opportunities in related fields.

“That really gives Mizzou Engineering students an advantage as it exposes them to a wide array of career options” said Emily Bozich corporate relations and professional development specialist. “It’s just one of the benefits of being on a campus that has so many different disciplines most of which have some connection to engineering.”

Cantwell: “This groundbreaking represents the commitment we made in the CHIPS & Science Act”

Today President Joe Biden traveled to Columbus Ohio to celebrate the groundbreaking of Intel’s new semiconductor manufacturing plant. The company’s expansion marks the first major investment in domestic microchip manufacturing directly linked to the passage of the CHIPS & Science Act championed by Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) Chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce Science and Transportation and signed into law on Aug. 9.

“This groundbreaking represents the commitment we made in the CHIPS & Science Act: to grow good paying jobs in the United States. Intel’s $20 billion plant will employ more than 3000 people and its partnership with the National Science Foundation will quickly put more than $10 million into workforce development at community colleges across the country and into scholarships for semiconductor education” said Sen. Cantwell. “We cannot afford to get left behind in designing and manufacturing the next generation of chips or in educating the semiconductor workforce. That’s why I fought so hard to get this law over the finish line.”

President Biden during the groundbreaking ceremony thanked lawmakers for working to pass the bill including Sen. Cantwell: “While she couldn’t be here Maria Cantwell also deserves a lot of credit. She’s the chair of the Senate Commerce Committee from the State of Washington. Maria was tireless in getting this bill through the Senate.

Intel had previously announced its plans to build a new semiconductor manufacturing plant in Ohio at the beginning of the year. But in July CEO Pat Gelsinger warned that the company would delay its plans to break ground on the $20 billion site if Congress was unable to pass the CHIPS & Science Act which included a $76 billion federal investment to spur domestic semiconductor manufacturing.

In a March 2022 hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee Gelsinger told Sen. Cantwell that vital industries of the future including autonomous vehicles artificial intelligence and advanced mRNA sequencing all hinge on access to high-performance semiconductors.

“All of these depend on the most advanced technologies available they need the highest performance computing at the lowest power capabilities to process these most advanced algorithms” Gelsinger said. “Those kinds of capabilities … will define the future competitiveness of industries globally.”

The CHIPS & Science Act went on to pass the Senate 64-33 and the House 243-187. Shortly after the bill passed Congress several companies including Intel Micron Qualcomm and GlobalFoundries announced plans to build new chip manufacturing facilities in the United States.

Sen. Cantwell was a key architect of the CHIPS & Science Act. She led the conference committee of more than 100 House and Senate members charged with reconciling a final version of the bill rallied lawmakers to ensure the package contained the largest-ever federal investments in innovation and science and joined President Biden for the signing ceremony at the White House last month.

The package invests $76 billion to develop the next generation of semiconductor technologies and to re-establish U.S. strengths in semiconductor manufacturing: $52 billion for competitive grants to spur domestic semiconductor manufacturing plus a 25 percent investment tax credit for domestic semiconductor manufacturing worth an estimated $24 billion.

Semiconductors are the oil of the 21st century – they’re found in a huge variety of products from vehicles medical devices and cell phones to advanced national security technology. Currently only 12% of chips are manufactured in the United States down from 37% in the 1990s.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9oaW8uZWR1L25ld3MvMjAyMi8wOS9vaGlvLXVuaXZlcnNpdHktYXdhcmRlZC1pbnRlbC1ncmFudC1mdW5kaW5nLXdpbGwtc2VydmUtbGVhZC1pbnN0aXR1dGlvbi1hcHBhbGFjaGlhbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ohio University awarded Intel grant funding will serve as lead institution for Appalachian Semiconductor Education ...,"A rendering shows early plans for two new leading-edge Intel processor factories in Licking County Ohio. Construction is expected to begin in late 2022 with production coming online at the end of 2025.

Intel has awarded Ohio University $3 million in grant funding to serve as the lead institution for the Appalachian Semiconductor Education and Technical (ASCENT) Ecosystem a program that will create an inclusive workforce development and training program to cultivate the next generation of skilled technical professionals for Ohio’s emerging semiconductor industry.

The funding is part of the Intel ®Semiconductor Education and Research Program for Ohio that was announced today in conjunction with Intel’s groundbreaking ceremony for its leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing plant in New Albany Ohio.

Over the next three years ASCENT will collaboratively develop and deliver diverse educational options across the region including standalone and stackable certificates associate degrees bachelor’s and graduate degrees that prepare students for career opportunities created by Intel’s arrival to Ohio.

“Ohio University has long been a champion of creating and fostering strategic economic and workforce development opportunities across Appalachia” said Ohio University President Hugh Sherman. “We’re excited to work with our peers to create new semiconductor education and career pathways that will positively impact the people living and working in our region for generations to come.”

ASCENT is comprised of a broad coalition of institutions colleges and technical centers across the southeastern Appalachian region of Ohio. Each will play a vital role in the visualization delivery and programming of the overall ASCENT Ecosystem.

Lead institution Ohio University including its Athens Chillicothe Eastern Lancaster Southern and Zanesville campuses is partnering with Belmont College Eastland-Fairfield Career Center Hocking College Marietta College Mid-East Career and Technology Center Shawnee State University Tri-County Career Center and Zane State College on the ASCENT program.

Eight proposals were selected from leading Ohio institutions including Ohio University. Each proposal includes collaborative efforts with other higher education institutions representing more than 80 institutions across the state of Ohio. In total the eight leading Ohio institutions will receive $17.7 million in funding over a three-year period.

Intel expects this first iteration of the program to produce nearly 9000 graduates for the industry and provide more than 2300 scholarships over three years helping diversify the talent pipeline.

“Intel is excited to be in Ohio the new Silicon Heartland and home to what will be one of our most sophisticated semiconductor manufacturing plants in the world” said Jim Evers Intel Vice President and Ohio General Manager. “Higher education plays a key role in the future success of our industry. We’re proud to support these institutions from every corner of the state as they work to build the workforce of tomorrow.”

Intel’s Semiconductor Education and Research Program for Ohio was announced in March as part of the company’s pledge to invest $100 million in education and research collaborations with universities community colleges and technical educators in Ohio and across the U.S. The program is designed to help build a pipeline of talent and bolster research programs. Of its $100 million investment Intel designated $50 million specifically to Ohio colleges and universities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzkvOS8yMzM0NDgzNC9zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLWpvZS1iaWRlbi1vaGlvLWludGVsLWdlbHNpbmdlci1jaGlwcy1zY2llbmNlLXN1YnNpZGllc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,President Joe Biden speaks after groundbreaking for Intel's $20 billion semiconductor plant,"President Joe Biden traveled to Ohio on Friday to celebrate the groundbreaking of Intel’s new $20 billion semiconductor plant one of the first domestic chip-making facilities to come out of the recently passed CHIPS and Science Act.

Intel’s Friday groundbreaking ceremony kicked off construction of what the company has called the “largest silicon manufacturing location on the planet.” It’s part of Intel’s plans to invest $100 billion in Ohio over the next 10 years. The company has said that the project could take more than 7000 workers to build the facility that is expected to house two separate factories and once finished employ 3000 workers.

“We need to make these chips right here in America to bring down everyday costs and create good jobs”

Intel had previously delayed the plant’s July groundbreaking ceremony because its plans largely relied “on funding from the CHIPS Act” which Congress had yet to pass. But after a summer of negotiations Biden signed the $280 billion tech and science bill last month calling it “a once in a generation investment in America itself.”

The bipartisan deal to boost American innovation in opposition to growing Chinese competition in the tech industry hopes to protect US economic and national security interests following a global semiconductor shortage. The start of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 fractured global chip supply chains making it more difficult for device makers to source semiconductors for their products. At the same time demand for these goods surged as offices closed and people started working from home.

“As we saw during the pandemic when the factories that make these chips shut down chips shut down. The global economy comes to a halt” Biden said at the Intel site Friday. “We need to make these chips right here in America to bring down everyday costs and create good jobs.”

Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger joined Biden for the ceremony he said marked the end of the Rust Belt and the beginnings of a “Silicon Heartland.” Other major chip manufacturers have announced plans for new domestic semiconductor facilities following the bill’s passage. Earlier this month Micron said that it would invest $15 billion to build a new plant in Idaho.

What You Need To Know

Intel officially welcomed Ohio to its multinational team



The groundbreaking ceremony celebrated Intel’s initial $20 billion investment to build a chip manufacturing site in Licking County



The first two fabrication facilities are expected to be completed in 2025



Intel announced it will give $17.7 million to Ohio colleges and universities



The event was packed with local and state leaders expressing their gratitude to Intel for choosing Ohio. Gov. Mike Dewine Lt. Gov. John Husted Sen. Rob Portman Sen. Sherrod Brown and many more joined Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger and Intel Ohio’s general manager Jim Evers.

President Joe Biden also made his way to the Buckeye state to talk about how big this investment is not only for Ohio but for the nation. He said America invented the semiconductor but today produces only about 10% of the world’s supply. Instead we rely on East Asia for 75% of global production according to the White House.

“The future of the chip industry is going to be made in America” Biden said. “This is about our economic security. It's about our national security. It's about good paying union jobs and you can raise a family and as my dad was saying have a little bit of breathing room. Jobs now. Jobs for the future. Jobs in every part of the country. We're not going to leave a part behind. There's no need to not develop the whole country. Jobs that show the industrial Midwest is back. The industrial Midwest is back.”

DeWine said this was a big opportunity for the many students in colleges and universities across Ohio.

“Today right now in Ohio there are young men young women attending our 14 public universities and others in our 74 private liberal arts colleges and universities studying mechanical industrial engineering other things all of whom may one day work here at Intel or in some other great Ohio high-tech job” DeWine said. “Today in Ohio there are young men and women in our 23 great community colleges studying microelectronics or electronic engineering technology who will one day work here as manufacturing technicians.”

INTEL’S COMMITMENT TO EDUCATION

Intel announced it will give $17.7 million to Ohio colleges and universities as part of its $50 million commitment to Ohio higher education institutions over the next decade.

Intel’s Ohio Semiconductor Education and Research Program will fund collaborative proposals led by the University of Cincinnati Central State University Columbus State Community College Kent State University Lorain County Community College Ohio University and two from The Ohio State University. Intel said all together these eight proposals involve more than 80 institutions of higher education across Ohio. It's a generous gift that many university presidents including Kristina M. Johnson president of The Ohio State University said they’re thankful for.

“We are so fortunate in Ohio to have political leadership that understands the importance of knowledge and in technology-intensive industries to our state's future as well as the role higher education plays in developing the ideas and the people for those industries” Johnson said.

DeWine said Ohio is in a position to become a magnet to attract and retain a skilled workforce. Students will no longer have to look beyond Ohio for great career opportunities and will no longer have to go to the coasts to find cutting-edge jobs.

“Intel is going to build a workforce of the future right here in Ohio” Biden added.

Many local and state leaders thanked Intel for choosing Ohio but Evers Intel Ohio’s general manager thanked Ohioans for their warm welcome.

“Thank you for so being so warm and welcoming” Evers said. “I you know I've been coming here once a month since March. And every time I come here I meet people like yourself and you've just embraced me and I am just very thankful and grateful to be a part of the Ohio family.”

CHIPS POWER OUR LIVES

Ohio is a state known to have a tradition of manufacturing and will soon be manufacturing the most advanced technology in the world. It's technology that many of the speakers said is of increasing importance now that every aspect of our lives is becoming more digital and everything digital runs on semiconductors.

“Let's build” said Gelsinger. “Today starts a project you know that I hope that we are building and expanding at this location for the next decade and a half. Today's a monumentous event for the state for New Albany literally for the entire Midwest.”

DeWine said the investment is a great victory for the state but said the best is yet to come.

“In the days months and years to come there will be many more victories in Ohio” DeWine said. “Because we are investing in and preparing our young people and our older people for the future. A future that is bright a future that holds great promise and a future where all Ohioans all Ohioans can live their American dream.”

Zelensky announced that his country is “open for business” – that is to say that foreign corporations are free to come and exploit its plentiful resources and low-paid labor.

In a speech launching the neoliberal selloff program Advantage Ukraine Zelensky offered Wall Street “a chance for you to invest now in projects worth of hundreds of billions of dollars.”

The financial news service Business Wire published a press release from the Ukrainian government in which Zelensky boasted:

The $400+ [billion] in investment options featured on AdvantageUkraine.com span public private partnerships privatization and private ventures. A USAID-supported project team of investment bankers and researchers appointed by Ukraine’s Ministry of Economy will work with businesses interested in investing.

It also quoted the president of NYSE Group Lynn Martin who said:

As the largest exchange globally we stand for freedom investor protection and unfettered access to capital. We are pleased to welcome President Zelenskyy virtually to the NYSE bell podium a symbol of the freedom and opportunity our U.S. capital markets have enabled around the globe. We are honored the President has chosen the NYSE to mark the kickoff of Advantage Ukraine and engage with the world’s business community.

The press release cited executives of US corporate giants Google Alphabet and Microsoft who salivated over the economic possibilities offered by Ukraine.

Reuters noted that the Ukrainian government hired British public relations firm WPP to run the marketing operation for Advantage Ukraine.

Zelensky coordinated his New York Stock Exchange publicity stunt with an editorial in the Wall Street Journal imploring US capitalists to “Invest in the Future of Ukraine.”

“I committed my administration to creating a favorable environment for investment that would make Ukraine the greatest growth opportunity in Europe since the end of World War II” Zelensky wrote.

He continued:

To create a safe transparent environment for business engagement Ukraine is pursuing investment guarantees from both the Group of Seven and the European Union reforming the country’s tax system and establishing a strong new legal framework. Our country has already adopted rules and laws to allow companies to build transparent corporate structures attract foreign investment more easily and use additional mechanisms to protect intangible assets. Favorable conditions will allow us to establish Ukraine as a powerful IT hub and implement innovative business ideas quickly and effectively.

Ukraine is a land of surprising opportunity. I personally invite you to be surprised by our potential and to invest in the future of Ukraine writes @ZelenskyyUa https://t.co/sWGpAyQhKq — Wall Street Journal Opinion (@WSJopinion) September 7 2022

Geopolitical Economy Report previously reported on a meeting by Western governments and corporations in Switzerland in July in which they planned harsh neoliberal economic policies to impose on Ukraine.

The Western participants published documents calling to cut labor laws “open markets” drop tariffs deregulate industries and “sell state-owned enterprises to private investors.”

Western governments and corporations met in Switzerland to plan harsh neoliberal economic policies to impose on post-war Ukraine calling to cut labor laws “open markets” deregulate industries and “sell state-owned enterprises to private investors.”https://t.co/J0n8db8ZLr — Geopolitical Economy Report (@GeopoliticaEcon) July 29 2022

In an interview with Geopolitical Economy Report economist Michael Hudson compared the new emergency anti-labor laws imposed by the Ukrainian government to the brutal neoliberal policies implemented by Chile’s far-right Pinochet dictatorship after a CIA-backed coup in 1973.

“It’s jaw dropping” Hudson said of Zelensky’s Wall Street Journal op-ed. “It’s like a parody of what a socialist would have written about how the class war would be put in into action by a fascist government.”

“So of course he was welcomed on the stock exchange for abolishing labor’s rights” Hudson added. “You could not have a more black-and-white example” of class war.

“This is exactly what [French President] Macron said when he said the ‘end of abundance.’ The Ukrainian labor force has just experienced the end of affluence neoliberal style.

“And as Mr. Zelensky said it may be the end of affluence for the labor force but it’s going to be a bonanza for you investors in the New York Stock Exchange. Come on in and join the party!”

“Somebody’s loss is turned into somebody else’s game. And that’s what happens in a class war. It’s a zero-sum game. There is no attempt at all to raise living standards.”

“Ukraine is the poorest country in Europe – but Zelensky said it’s not poor enough. He said you think this is something wait until our new law takes effect. That’ll really show you what it means to be the poorest country in Europe.”

“But it’ll also be the richest country in Europe for the 1%” Hudson concluded.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy90cnVtcC1oYXMtYS1sb25nLWFuZC1yb2NreS1yZWxhdGlvbnNoaXAtd2l0aC10aGUtcHVibGljLW1hcmtldHMtMTc1MTQyMjc0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trump has a long and rocky relationship with the public markets,"In 1995 Donald Trump bought 40 Wall St. down the street from the New York Stock Exchange. The property has proven to be the former president’s most durable connection to public markets.

Trump's complicated relationship with the public markets was in full view this week with the postponement of his potential plans to take his social media venture public. Trump Media & Technology Group had planned to go public via a merger with a SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) but federal regulators are probing the deal and may end up derailing it.

This would not be the first time Trump's dealings with Wall Street went awry. So why don't Trump and the public markets mix? While Trump may long for the access to capital that comes with a market debut being traded on the public markets comes with a big condition: regulators have much more power to look into questionable business practices of public companies.

“The public markets do require transparency they do require filings with the regulators and so there are a lot of checks and balances"" Reena Aggarwal director of Georgetown’s Psaros Center for Financial Markets noted recently in an interview about Trump.

The announcement in October that blank check company Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC) would merge with Donald Trump's media company sparked immediate excitement from investors. The impending deal also caught the attention of regulators. By December the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was publicly looking into whether Trump’s company illegally negotiated with DWAC too early.

In a statement Thursday Trump’s company said the SEC “has needlessly delayed its review of our proposed merger causing real and unnecessary financial harm to DWAC investors.”

‘It’s the New York Stock Exchange’

This was not the first time Trump courted Wall Street. He led a public company beginning in 1995 when Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts began to trade under the ticker DJT.

“This is such a big day for us it’s the New York Stock Exchange” Trump said at the time.

DJT's stint on the exchange quickly soured with its stock falling below its IPO price by 1997. Seven years later the company was bankrupt and delisted from the exchange.

Trump's questionable business practices may have precipitated that downfall.

In 2016 the Washington Post looked into how despite losing money every year the company paid Trump handsomely and apparently shifted funds and assets between his public and his private business in ways that benefited him greatly but undermined his shareholders. Forbes also reported on that period and found that it “didn’t take long for Donald John Trump to betray his shareholders.”

Story continues

Trump has declined to respond to specifics allegations relating to his tenure atop DJT but told The Washington Post at the time “I make great deals for myself.”

The SEC also brought a case — which was later settled — alleging Trump’s company misled investors on an earnings report.

Back then retail investors who admired Trump helped drive up the stock price but didn't receive financial rewards when the price crashed.

This year's SPAC drama echoes that time. DWAC has also lost money for retail investors and Trump fans over the last year. The stock hit an all-time high of $94.20 when interest in the company peaked; by Friday morning it was trading at around $23 per share.

‘Private company anyone???’

Historically Trump’s private organizations have faced consequences from a $2 million judgment against Trump’s foundation to a $25 million decision against Trump University. And last month the Trump Organization’s long-time chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg pleaded guilty to fraud ahead of a criminal trial set for next month being prosecuted by the Manhattan District Attorney.

Meanwhile New York Attorney General Letitia James has her own civil probe into Trump and his business.

Have his troubles made it hard for him to get cash? ""While the company was under indictment he was able to secure hundreds of millions of dollars of new loans and his balance sheet is now much stronger than it was at any point during his presidency"" Dan Alexander who has written a book about Trump's finances recently told Forbes.

But Trump’s media company could be different. Truth Social — which Trump launched when he was kicked off Twitter in the wake of the Jan. 6 2021 Capitol attack — is facing reports of serious financial difficulties according to both Fox Business and Axios.

Trump's company denies the reports. In a recent Truth Social post Trump bragged about his wealth and implied he might try to stay in his comfort zone: “Private company anyone???"" he wrote.

If Trump’s SPAC deal does indeed fall apart Trump's 40 Wall Street building may remain the closest Trump will get to stock traders anytime soon. Meanwhile that property could exemplify his alleged wrongdoing — including potential claims that he misstated the value of his properties to suit his various needs.

Trump told lenders in 2012 that 40 Wall Street was worth $527 million according to the Washington Post. But then he reportedly told tax officials it was worth less than one thirtieth of that: $16.7 million. That's the kind of about-face that might not be possible with shareholders to answer to.

The Institute of International Education (IIE) in a report published in June said U.S. colleges saw an increase in applications for admission after seeing significantly fewer new international student enrollments in 2020 and 2021.

Does it mean international students are returning in numbers to the U.S.?

“I definitely say that is true. Absolutely” IIE Co-President Jason Czyz told VOA. He said IIE found the biggest factor in renewed interest in the United States for higher education is the waning of the pandemic.

“Is it entirely done? No. But people around the world are learning to live with it. And as a result of two years where there was very limited international mobility for students we're seeing that there's definitely this pent-up demand for international exchange and the U.S. of course is one of the main markets for that” he said.

The IIE’s June report cites data from 559 institutions and shows that 65% of them saw an increase in their international student applications for the 2022-2023 academic year across all institutional types up from 43% one year ago.

An increase in applications however does not necessarily mean growth in foreign student enrollment in U.S. higher education institutions.

“It can take some time to obtain a visa to study in the United States” Czyz said. “But typically there is some relationship or proportionality between applications and enrollment. And so we do expect to see international student enrollment take off.”

Prospective international students can only apply for a visa after they have been accepted to an U.S. institution that is approved by ICE’s Student Exchange and Visitor Program. And it takes a minimum of 120 days to for a U.S. consulate to issue a visa to the students. ICE is U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

According to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) in 2021 there were 1236748 international students with F-1 and M-1 visas enrolled in the U.S. In 2020 the year the pandemic began the number was 1251569 a decline of 17.86% from 2019. SEVP is part of ICE.

An F-1 visa is for those attending an academic program or seeking a full-time degree at an U.S. institution while the M-1 visa covers those enrolled in vocational studies such as language programs cosmetology schools and mechanical studies among others.

Boundless Immigration a Seattle-based firm that helps people navigate the U.S. immigration system released a study September 1 showing that even before the pandemic international student enrollment had dropped and that the top reasons for the decline were visa delays and denials competition from colleges in other countries and restrictive immigration policies under the Trump administration.

The transition to the Biden administration during the COVID-19 pandemic “makes it hard to delineate pandemic-related effects on international student enrollment from the larger political rhetoric and context in the country” according to Boundless.

Reports from Boundless and IIE show that visa concerns were among the top reasons for enrollment declines in fall 2019 which was aggravated by U.S. embassies and consulates closing in 2020 because of the pandemic. Their researchers also said colleges and universities reported students enrolling in other countries such as the United Kingdom which had eased its process for applicants to access student and work visas and therefore attracted more international students.

International students are important to universities for the economic impact they bring to the U.S.

According to Boundless international students contributed $28.4 billion to the economy and supported 306308 jobs during the 2020-2021 academic year. The states with the most international students are California Florida New York Massachusetts and Texas.

“We're still seeing a steep decline especially from China which represents more than one-third of international students” Lynn Pasquerella president of the American Association of Colleges and Universities told VOA.

According to the U.S. State Department it granted 64261 F-1 visas to Chinese students in the first six months of 2019. In the first six months of 2022 that number was 31055.

Canada Singapore and the U.K. have seen an increase in Chinese student enrollment over the past several years thanks to several factors including logistical challenges to come to the U.S.

An IIE Open Door report showed that Chinese nationals accounted for 35% of foreigners studying in the U.S. and contributed $15.9 billion in the 2019-2020 academic year before the pandemic drove study abroad numbers down.

F-1 and M-1 students come from more than 224 countries and territories. The top 10 places with the largest number of international students in the United States are Brazil Canada China India Japan Mexico Saudi Arabia South Korea Taiwan and Vietnam.

“Given the overreliance that many American institutions have had on international students to meet the bottom line that's of concern or should be of concern” Pasquerella said.

Czyz says IIE expects U.S. institutions to be on track for increased numbers of international students. IIE expects to release a new report on international students' applications and enrollments in November.

“We have over 4000 institutions of higher education in the United States and the most diverse higher education industry in the world in terms of all different sizes all different disciplines. The choices in the United States are fantastic and it's the more diverse higher education community than anywhere else in the world” he said.",,,

But this semester English literature major Emily Aycrigg is packing her bags with 17th-century attire for a conference in Victoria Canada where she will meet hundreds of Jane Austen fans from around the continent.

Aycrigg has won first place in the undergraduate division of the 2022 Jane Austen Society of North America (JASNA) Annual Essay Contest for her paper “The Old Well-Established Grievance: Generational Conflict in Austen’s Sense and Sensibility” out of more than 200 papers submitted. She has been awarded a check for $1000 a Norton Critical Edition of every Jane Austen novel and a free invitation to JASNA’s annual general body meeting. There she will discuss Austen’s work with fellow “Janeites” while attending presentations banquets and even a regency-era ball.

UCF English literature student Emily Aycrigg

While now an accomplished student Aycrigg recalls struggling through her first bachelor’s degree in political science philosophy and economics. But after graduating and teaching middle school English for several years she found a renewed love for learning which spurred her to enroll at UCF for a second degree to pursue her true passion: literature.

“Once I got back on my feet and found a career I enjoyed I thought: I’d really like to go back to school and study the subject I love at a university I’m proud of” Aycrigg says. “At UCF I realized how much fun school actually is getting to read interesting things and have cool discussions with cool people.”

A lifelong reader Aycrigg grew up reading Jane Austen. Now as a student in the English department she has discovered the value of analyzing classic works from a variety of perspectives.

“You can simultaneously read for enjoyment and for the broader cultural context which I find fascinating” Aycrigg says. “One of the things I’ve learned from my literature degree at UCF is that just because you’re asked to critically analyze a text you used to have an uncomplicated love for doesn’t mean that you can’t still love that text. It’s just that you’re being taught to look at it through multiple lenses.”

The paper Aycrigg submitted to JASNA’s essay contest was the final assignment for the course British Authors: Jane Austen taught by senior lecturer Kathleen Hohenleitner who encouraged her students to apply. According to Hohenleitner Aycrigg was extremely proactive in the class always collaborating with her peers in discussions.

“Emily is an excellent writer thinker and researcher” Hohenleitner says “but what I most admire about her is how actively she engages with her peers and their ideas in every class she takes whether in person or online. Every class she takes is better because she is in it. I think she richly deserves this award.”

What’s next in store for Aycrigg? Graduate school she says. Ever the learner Aycrigg hopes to continue her education with a doctoral degree and keep doing what she loves: reading writing and talking about books.

Aycrigg’s paper can be read on the winning entries page of the JASNA website.

UCF’s English literature bachelor’s program helps students develop the ability to read discerningly think critically and write clearly. This track encompasses the study of literature in its historical cultural and theoretical contexts. Students learn about the ways of people and society as well as develop a lifelong pleasure to be found in this art form. The degree track is offered fully online and also on campus providing an opportunity to learn where and how individuals want.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNDY3LTAyMi0zMzAzMS0z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Global energy spectrum of the general oceanic circulation,"Description of datasets

For the geostrophic ocean surface currents we use a Level 4 (L4) post-processed dataset of daily-averaged geostrophic velocity on a 1/4° grid spanning January 2010 to October 2018 (except for the seasonality analysis where we use 2012–2016). The data is obtained from the AVISO + analysis of multi-mission satellite altimetry measurements for sea surface height (SSH)35. The product identifier of the AVISO dataset used in this work is “SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_L4_MY_008_047” (https://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00148).

We also analyze 1-day averaged surface SSH-derived currents from the NEMO numerical modelling framework which is coupled to the Met Office Unified Model atmosphere component and the Los Alamos sea ice model (CICE). The NEMO dataset consists of weakly coupled ocean-atmosphere data assimilation and forecast system which is used to provide 10 days of 3D global ocean forecasts on a 1/12° grid. We use daily-averaged data that spans four years from 2015 to 2018. More details about the coupled data assimilation system used for the production of the NEMO dataset can be found in refs. 3637. The specific product identifier of the NEMO dataset used here is “GLOBAL_MULTIYEAR_PHY_001_030” (https://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00021).

Coarse-graining on the sphere

For a field ϕ(x) a “coarse-grained” or (low-pass) filtered field which contains only length-scales larger than ℓ is defined as

$${\overline{\phi }}_{\ell }({{{{{{{\bf{x}}}}}}}})={G}_{\ell }*\phi$$ (3)

where * in the context of this work is a convolution on the sphere as shown in ref. 16 and G ℓ (r) is a normalized kernel (or window function) so that ∫d2rG ℓ (r) = 1. Operation (3) may be interpreted as a local space average over a region of diameter ℓ centred at point x. The kernel G ℓ that we use here is essentially a graded top-hat kernel:

$${G}_{\ell }({{{{{{{\bf{x}}}}}}}})=\frac{A}{2}\left(1-\tanh \left(10\left(\frac{\gamma ({{{{{{{\bf{x}}}}}}}})}{\ell /2}-1\right)\right)\right).$$ (4)

We use geodesic distance γ(x) between any location x = (λ ϕ) on Earth’s surface relative to location (λ 0  ϕ 0 ) where coarse-graining is being performed which we calculate using

$$\gamma ({{{{{{{\bf{x}}}}}}}})={R}_{{{{{{{{\rm{E}}}}}}}}}\arccos \left[\sin (\phi )\sin ({\phi }_{0})+\cos (\phi )\cos ({\phi }_{0})\cos (\lambda -{\lambda }_{0})\right]$$ (5)

with R E = 6371 km for Earth’s radius. In Eq. (4) A is a normalization factor evaluated numerically to ensure G ℓ area integrates to unity. A convolution with G ℓ in Eq. (4) is a spatial analogue to an ℓ-day running time-average.

The above formalism holds for coarse-graining scalar fields. To coarse-grain a vector field on a sphere generally requires more care16 particularly for vector fields that need not be toroidal (2D non-divergent). However as this work focuses on SSH-derived 2D non-divergent velocity fields these concerns do not apply here. More details can be found in ref. 38.

Comparing coarse-graining to Fourier analysis

It is common to quantify the spectral distribution of ocean kinetic energy via Fourier transforms computed either along transects or within regions; e.g. refs. 101239404142. This approach has rendered great insights into the length scales of oceanic motion and the cascade of energy through these scales4344454647. However it has notable limitations for the ocean where the spatial domain is generally not periodic thus necessitating adjustments to the data (e.g. by tapering) before applying Fourier transforms. Methods to produce an artificially periodic dataset can introduce spurious gradients length-scales and flow features not present in the original data18. A related limitation concerns the chosen region size with this size introducing an artificial upper length scale cutoff along with an artificial discreteness of wavenumbers that can bias the KE distribution across scales. In this manner no scales are included that are larger than the region size even if larger structures exist in the ocean. Furthermore the data is typically assumed to lie on a flat tangent plane to enable the use of Cartesian coordinates. However if the region becomes large enough to sample the earth’s curvature then that puts into question the use of the familiar Cartesian Fourier analysis of sines and cosines. The use of spherical harmonics common for the atmosphere is not naturally suitable for the ocean again since the ocean boundaries are irregular. These limitations mean that in practice Fourier methods are only suited for open ocean regions away from boundaries and over a rather limited regional size.

As a demonstration of both the validity and advantages of coarse-graining for energy spectra consider Fig. 4. This figure reproduces the energy spectrum from Fig. 3 of ref. 6 and includes both the coarse-graining and traditional Fourier energy spectra measured from the 1/12° NEMO dataset. Spectra are calculated for the 5° × 5° box centred at 164°E 37°N which corresponds to the Kuroshio extension.

Fig. 4: Energy spectra. Comparison of the filtering spectrum (orange) traditional Fourier spectrum (blue) and the Fourier spectrum from ref. 6 (green data kindly provided by authors of ref. 6) for the 5° × 5° box region centred at 164°E 37°N (roughly the Kuroshio extension). The dashed black line provides a reference for a −5/3 slope. Note that the ℓ axis (top) is in 100 km. Full size image

For length scales ≲ 200 km the three spectra generally agree very well and all produce close to a −5/3 spectrum. Ref. 6 used a higher resolution dataset and so the spectra disagree for scales < 20 km as expected. At larger scales coarse-graining does not require tapering and so the spectrum at scales ≳ 200 km is not contaminated by the shape of the tapering window or the box size. As a result coarse-graining is able to detect that the spectrum for this region peaks at ≈ 250 km. An exact relation between Fourier wavenumbers k and filtering wavenumbers k ℓ is provided by eq. (16) in ref. 18 which shows that the filtering spectrum \(\overline{E}({k}_{\ell })\) at k ℓ is essentially a weighted average of the traditional Fourier spectrum E(k) over a range of Fourier wavenumbers k centred around k ℓ . Therefore it is worth being mindful that agreement between filtering and Fourier spectra may not be perfect in practice as discussed at length in18 due to the fact that compact spatial filtering kernels are not strictly local in k-space compared to a sharp-spectral filter which can lead to additional smoothing as a function of scale. This is the price paid for gaining spatially local information such as allowing us to distinguish the tropics and the hemispheres (see also Figs. 1 and 5) since concurrently exact spatial and scale localization is forbidden by the uncertainty principle.

ACC as the spectral peak

In Fig. 5 we provide plots a visualization of the zonally-averaged kinetic energy for selected filtering scales. Scales larger than 103 km have a dominant contribution from latitudes [60°S 40°S] roughly corresponding to the ACC and another contribution over [30°N 40°N] roughly corresponding to the NH western boundary currents. Scales larger than 5 × 103 km continue to show a clear ACC signal with no NH signal since this filter scale is just beyond the NH gyre spectral peak. Finally scales larger than 12 × 103 km have no distinct ACC signal showing that the ACC has been fully removed by coarse-graining at this scale. Combined these results provide further support for our claim that the 104 km spectral peak corresponds to the ACC.

Land treatment

When coarse-graining near land it is necessary to have a methodology for incorporating land into the filtering kernel (c.f. ref. 38 for more in-depth discussion of land treatments). In the work presented here we make the choice of treating land as zero velocity water. Since coarse-graining is essentially a ‘blurring’ (analogized with taking off ones glasses to have a blurrier picture) the land-water division itself also become less well-defined and so treating land as zero-velocity water is both conceptually consistent and aligns with no-flow boundary conditions. Additionally this land treatment allows for a ‘fixed’ (or homogeneous) filtering kernel at all points in space and as a result allows for commutativity with derivatives (e.g. divergence-free flows remain divergence-free after coarse-graining)16. Note however that only the true water area is used as the denominator when computing area averages (e.g. the NH area-averaged energy is the coarse KE summed over all NH cells including land divided by the water-area of NH). This is merely a normalization choice and does not affect our results. For NEMO data the normalization area is 104 × 106 km2 in NH and 155 × 106 km2 in SH. For AVISO the area varies with time due to sea ice coverage between [90.5 98.7] × 106 km2 for NH and [141 154] × 106 km2 for SH.

Deforming kernel approach

An alternative choice is to deform the kernel around land so that only water cells are included at the cost of losing the homogeneity of the kernel. The benefit to this approach is that it does not require conceptually treating land as zero velocity water. However it has the significant drawback that coarse-graining no longer commutes with differentiation and as a result does not necessarily preserve flow properties such as being divergence-free. Additionally a kernel that is inhomogeneous (i.e. changes shape depending on geographic location) does not necessarily conserve domain averages including the kinetic energy of the flow and has the potential to both increase or decrease the domain average. More details are provided in ref. 38.

Comparing land treatments

Figure 6 presents the energy spectra similar to Fig. 2 in the main text using both deforming and fixed kernels for the single day 02 Jan 2015. The deforming-kernel spectra agree remarkably well with the non-deforming (fixed) kernel spectra in that they present the mesoscales ACC and gyre peaks at similar scales. There are some quantitative differences such as the deforming kernel SH spectra presents a slightly broader and higher-magnitude ACC peak.

Isolating hemisphere spectra

In this work we are primarily concerned with the extra-tropical latitudes: [90°S 15°S] and [15°N 90°N]. However at very large length scales information from the equatorial band and opposing hemisphere can become introduced through the filter kernel. To resolve this issue we use a ‘reflected hemispheres’ approach wherein one hemisphere is reflected and copied onto the other hemisphere essentially producing a world with two north or two south hemispheres. It is worth noting that reflected hemispheres and equatorial masking would not be necessary in a context where ageostrophic velocities are also considered and a global power spectrum is desired. They are used here because we wish to disentangle the power spectra of the geostrophic flow in each of the extra-tropical hemispheres.

Figure S2 in the Supplementary Material (SM) shows the filtering spectra from NEMO without relying on hemisphere reflection and is to be compared to Fig. 2 in the main text. The two are in qualitative agreement with an ACC peak in the SH and mesoscale peaks in both hemispheres. Unsurprisingly the spectra only deviate for very large filtering scales where an increasing amount of extra-hemisphere information is captured by the large kernels. Specifically the NH spectra has a third peak at scales ℓ > 104 km that is not present when using reflected hemispheres. This very large-scale peak is a result of the NH kernels capturing the ACC. It is worth noting however that the main ACC peak is still present in the SH spectra as is the NH gyre peak at approximately ℓ = 3 × 103 km.

Uncertainty estimates of ℓ-band values

Table 1 presented median values of the RMS velocity and percentage of total KE contained within various ℓ-bands. Table 2 presents the interquartile range (25th to 75th percentiles) to provide an estimate for the sensitivity of those values.

Seasonality

A 60-day running mean is applied to remove higher frequencies and allow us to better consider the longer-time trend and individual years are averaged onto a ‘typical’ year for the purpose of comparison. Seasonality results use the 5 years spanning 2012–2016 for AVISO and the 4 years spanning 2015–2018 for NEMO.

A useful statistical method for comparing signals is to compare the normalized deviations or z-scores of the signal. For a set of points {x i ∣ i = 1…N} each point x i is transformed into a corresponding z-score z i via z i = (x i − μ x )/σ x  where μ x and σ x are the mean and standard deviation of the x i . As a result data points that are larger than the mean produce a positive z-score while those smaller than the mean produce a negative z-score. Note that the normalized deviation (z-scores) in Fig. 3 are computed independently for each k ℓ  and so comparing magnitudes between scales is non-trivial.

Regression analysis of phase shift

Figure 3 presents a clear phase shift in the seasonal cycle as a function of length-scale. In order to quantify the phase shift we need to first extract a meaningful set of (k ℓ  time) points. To that end we extract for each k ℓ  the (i) times corresponding to the lowest 10% (dark blue in Fig. 3) (ii) two middle-most 10% for the two zero-crossings (white in Fig. 3) and (iii) highest 10% (dark red in Fig. 3) of the normalized deviations presented in Fig. 3. This is essentially extracting the (k ℓ  time)-coordinates for the line of darkest red darkest blue and the two white lines resulting in a total of four regression sets. Periodic phase adjustment to the days of the year is applied to maintain monotonicity in time and the k ℓ grid is truncated to focus on regimes with a clear linear trend. The extracted data points are shown as the dots/vertical bars in Fig. S3 in the SM along with their corresponding regression fits.

Figure 7 presents the linear regression slope analysis for the data shown in Fig. S3. The different regression analyses generally agree well with 12 of the 16 regression sets indicating a 35–45 day time-lag per octave of spatial scales. From this analysis we conclude that length-scales that differ by a factor of two (i.e. ℓ 1 /ℓ 2 = 2) have seasonal cycles that are off-set by 41 ± 3 days. Scales that differ a decade (ℓ 1 /ℓ 2 = 10) would correspondingly have a phase shift of 136 ± 10days or roughly 4.5 months.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzA5NTk2NTI2MjIwMjI3MznSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Co-recycling of natural and synthetic carbon materials for a sustainable circular economy,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652622022739 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzA5NTk2NTI2MjIwMjI3MznSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Global food prices are surging at the fastest pace ever as the war in Ukraine has disrupted crop supplies piling up more inflationary pain on consumers and worsening a global hunger crisis through markets for staple grains and vegetable oils. Invesco DB Agriculture Fund DBA added 4.1% past month (as of Sep 2 2022).

The war in Ukraine then sent food prices surging at their fastest pace ever. Russia and Ukraine are major exporters of grains and they together account for more than a quarter of the global trade in wheat and a fifth in corn. Ukraine is also the biggest exporter of sunflower oil.

Russia and its ally Belarus are also the world’s major fertilizer exporters. In addition to sanctions the spike in energy prices have raised production and transportation costs of fertilizers raising the possibility of continued surge in food prices (read: 3 ETFs to Fight Surging Food Inflation).

Many countries have resorted to food protectionism amid rising shortages. Export restrictions are making food prices even more expensive. Some specific soft commodities staged even higher run. Corn wheat and coffee are among the few agro-based commodities that staged a rally lately.

Dry weather in key producing region of Brazil led to gains in coffee prices. This has hurt the development of coffee buds. Drought and lower crop condition ratings have boosted corn prices. Many private analysts are cutting yield and total production of corn and soybean estimates. The USDA Crop conditions report revealed corn ratings down 3% at 58% good to excellent marking a larger drop than anticipated per agriculture.com.

In a nutshell the world is striving to restock grain reserves hurt by trade disruptions in the Baltic Sea and unfavorable weather conditions especially drought in some of the key growing regions. Drought is shrinking crops from the U.S. Farm Belt to China’s Yangtze River basin (per Bloomberg) resulting in fears of global hunger and weighing on the outlook for inflation. We do not expect the rally to lose momentum in September too.

Below we highlight a few winning agricultural ETFs of the month of August. These ETFs may continue its winning momentum in September too.

These tools bring value for all stakeholders in the process.

They simplify complex consent processes for participants which leads to better engagement

They reduce the burden of paperwork for clinical staff which leads to greater accuracy and efficiency and

They provide sponsors with real-time participant consent data to support the study management and regulatory processes.

So why have so many clinical trial sites delayed adoption of eConsent solutions?

The lag in adoption is not entirely unexpected. Healthcare professionals have a long history of using paper in their patient interactions. They are familiar with having patients fill out paper questionnaires hand-writing prescriptions and printing care information. They can instinctively be cautious about making changes to that routine.

However the benefits of adopting eConsent in the trial environment far outweigh the temporary disruption it causes in clinical site routine.

A great first impression. eConsent sets the stage for a streamlined trial experience from day one. It creates uniform processes for developing and managing informed consent and sends a message to participants that their time and participation is valued. These participants are accustomed to digital interactions in their personal and professional lives. They will expect the same level of digital sophistication during the trial.

A feature-rich eConsent product also makes it easier and more convenient to complete consenting steps. Complex protocols can be easily explained using multimedia and electronic glossaries that are shared within the eConsent environment. These features create an engaging experience for all patient populations including patients that are unable to read. Electronic forms with audio-visual effects can also be shared with participants so they can review and discuss the information with their families and caregivers in the comfort of their homes. This enhances participant understanding and frees site staff to spend their time with participants answering questions and addressing any residual doubts.

Focusing on patient wellbeing from the start helps build deeper trust which can translate into greater long-term retention. It is a gracious way to begin the trial and ensures participants have all the facts before signing up.

Compliance from day one. Research shows that incomplete informed consent forms is one of the most common reasons for protocol deviations in clinical studies. Along with cost implications these deviations can render data unusable and create unnecessary delays in the trial. eConsent systems dramatically reduce this risk. In a review of nearly 100 trials across IQVIA that used eConsent compared to paper consent-related major and critical protocol deviations were reduced from an average of 14% to only 6%.

Digitizing this complex process removes the manual data entry and paper trails that often lead to error. Once participants complete the eConsent process the information is instantly filed in the study database creating a safe and permanent record of patient consents which are easy for regulators to verify. The platform will automatically adapt formats and timing to follow local regulatory requirements ensuring consent-related compliance across global studies.

Easy remote interactions. Decentralized and hybrid clinical trials give participants the flexibility to participate in clinical research without the need to visit sites for every step of the trial. eConsent tools support this flexibility by allowing site staff to consent participants efficiently effectively and remotely. Consent forms may require signatures from multiple signatories including parents guardians and/or Legally Authorized Representatives. eConsent allows each of these signatories to remotely read and sign the consent at their own convenience regardless of their location.

These flexible digital consenting options enhance the participant experience which leads to better recruitment and retention rates at sites.

Seamless intuitive site experience. Clinical site staff across the globe serve an ongoing stream of patients often for multiple trials. Clinical trial activity further impacts their already busy schedules. eConsent systems ease efforts and simplify the complex process of tracking consents and protocol amendments by generating timely alerts and calls for actions.

So how can trial sponsors successfully promote the adoption of eConsent across sites?

If sponsors want sites to adopt this technology as part of their trial strategy they must demonstrate the ease-of-use and time savings it will bring for site staff.

That begins with choosing an eConsent solution that is intuitive and easy to integrate into their trail workflow – site staff will abandon any technology that has a frustrating user experience for them or their patients.

When choosing a platform sponsors should look for technology that offers features conducive to the trial protocol provides a seamless user experience and includes built-in tools that make it easy for patients to complete forms on time without added assistance.

When vetting eConsent options it is important to also consider the support provided by the vendor. An experienced eConsent vendor with a global dedicated implementation team will offer customization and training for the technology as well as help desk support to sites and patients for quick problem resolution. That added help ensures a seamless roll out and adoption.

Once the eConsent system is deployed sponsors need to reinforce the benefits during study initiation kickoff and key opinion leader meetings. Offering recognition and encouragement for exceeding eConsent adoption goals can motivate sites and help them tide over initial hesitation towards new technologies.

The future will be digital

eConsent tools are poised to be a permanent part of the trial experience. Encouraging sites to adopt this technology today will enhance compliance and optimize consent data management while providing participants with a high-quality engaging experience from the outset of the trial.

Now that team is getting together to be celebrated this evening as the 2022 Miners gear up to take on Hancock at Miners Field.

The 20th anniversary festivities begin before tonight’s game at 5:30 p.m. with a tailgate party at the back of nearby LaCombe Field. There will also be an open house for the newly constructed Negaunee practice facility which will be the first time that the community will be able to check it out.

The Miners and Bulldogs kick off their football game at 7 p.m. with the 2002 players coaches and cheerleaders being honored at halftime. Following the game those state champs will gather at the Elks Lodge to reminisce some more.

“It’s awesome I’ve had text messages and emails from different guys on how they’re looking forward to coming back” Jacobson said. “Some of these guys that graduated in 2003 I haven’t seen since. I’m looking forward to seeing everybody and just how they’ve grown how they’ve changed and I’m sure there’s going to be a ton of stories flying around and that’s the biggest part for me.”

To say that this will be a big night for the Negaunee community is an understatement and Jacobson will wear a couple of different hats tonight. This is his 23rd season coaching Negaunee football and he’s excited to see the team from his third season that won the school’s only football state title.

On the other hand as athletic director it’s an exciting night to have the team back together again with all of the changes that have been in the works.

“It’s a good time to be in Negaunee with the facilities that are coming up” Jacobson said. “Our indoor practice facility our new softball facility up top next to our beautiful tennis courts it’s a good time to be in Negaunee.

“I think to bring that championship team back this year and see what they’ve been a part of creating just even the improvements around the stadium it just shows the support that you get from this community both academically and athletically but just how much our community is behind our school.”

The 2002 team paved the way for future Negaunee football teams with its success. That Miners team won the state title game over Hopkins 28-20 in overtime and it just so happened to be one of six wins that fall that was by decided by one score or less. They had to face off with Ishpeming and Iron Mountain twice each — each team once in the regular season and once in the playoffs — winning all four games by a total of 24 points.

In ’02 Jacobson had become the Negaunee head coach two years prior so it was early in his career that the Miners won the title. Since then NHS has continued to have success and been a top program in the Upper Peninsula and Jacobson has taken what the ’02 team did and tried to pass it on to his future squads.

“It’s huge that everyone has a role or a niche on a team” Jacobson said. “It’s more than just one person it’s more than the starters it’s the whole team that puts on that maize and blue jersey and that helmet with the ‘N’ on it.

“Every year you learn something as a coach and I think the biggest thing is that you have to be good you have to be lucky and you have to have good kids. That’s been a formula here in Negaunee for quite some time and we’re just trying to do our part to carry it on.”

The majority of the championship team will be in Negaunee tonight Jacobson said. This reunion feels like an event that could be held all by itself but there’s still a football game at Miners Stadium.

With the ’02 team in the stands to take in the action the ’22 team looks to make its own mark and improve to 3-0. The 2002 team might not have played Hancock but Jacobson hopes that the 2022 team can continue to learn some lessons.

“It really helps in preparation for our Hancock game because you can relate to different things throughout our championship season to this year’s team” Jacobson said. “How we tried to make sure to take things one step at a time during our championship season and this is no different.

“We have a Hancock team coming in where we’ll have to be at our best to beat. It’s exciting that not only do we have a game but we get to play in front of a special group.”

Activities will commence at 5 p.m. at the Stonington Lighthouse. The event should last around 60 minutes and will be followed by snacks and refreshments.

Every year the monarch butterflies make their long pilgrimage south from Canada and the Northern United States to Mexico. Central Upper Michigan particularly the Stonington Peninsula is one of the sites where they pause and rest along the journey. UP Wild will gather at Stonington Lighthouse to offer them a safe passage. There will be special opening ceremony and then they will collectively offer them blessings and prayers for their long journey.

Bishop Rayford Ray of the Episcopal Diocese of Northern Michigan is planning to attend.

“The butterfly is a powerful symbol of the resurrection and of life” said Ray. “UP Wild will gather in prayer to honor the land and the water and nature itself.”

The Eastern Monarch Butterfly cannot tolerate the cold northern regions and must migrate to a warmer climate each year. The last two weeks of August and the first two weeks of September is the traditional period for their annual migration to the Sierra Madre Mountains in Mexico a journey of 2500 to 3000 miles. As they travel only by day averaging 50 to 100 miles per day their flight will take about five weeks.

The pilgrimage has a stopover at Stonington Point in early September where tens of thousands will pause before crossing the open water to Door County Wisconsin. The Monarchs gather in trees and bushes for warmth as they rest and wait for conditions that will allow them to continue their journey south.

Monarchs are on the endangered species watch list. Their numbers are down by 90% owing to loss of habitat pesticides and climate change. According to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources the Monarchs alone provide for pollination of one third of the food supply. Worldwide pollinating insects account for three-fourths of the global food supply.

“We are connected to the monarchs. It’s a two-way thing and if they are going extinct it effects all of us” Ray said.

Join us at the Stonington Lighthouse on September 14 to bless these amazing creatures. Please share this and invite others.

Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines has made it through the pandemic without starting a single tag route. Other airlines such as United American Alaska and others combined destinations into a single flight to save costs during the pandemic due to severely light passenger loads. SkyWest under the United Express banner combined many smaller EAS communities into a single flight routing this past spring when the airline began to struggle with the pilot shortage. A tag flight is when an aircraft makes a stop in the first city and continues to the next.

This all changes this coming Monday Sept. 12 2022 when SkyWest under the Delta Connection brand will begin its tag routes which will affect eight Essential Air Service communities; Pellston (PLN) Alpena (APN) Sault Ste. Marie (CIU) Iron Mountain (IMT) and Escanaba (ESC) all of which are in Michigan; Brainerd (BRD) and Bemidji (BJI) located in Minnesota and Rhinelander (RHI) in Wisconsin.

All of the changes talked about in the previous article which can be viewed HERE are still in effect starting Sept. 12 2022 but with one major change to the schedule they will now only last for less than a month. Previously the tag flights were planned to continue until at least January 2023 due to pilot shortages. The reason for this quick and drastic flight change is the communities more specifically the people living there.

Escanaba Mich. and Rhinelander Wis. Airport managers and town leaders in many of the communities wrote letters to the DOT and others saying how this change would greatly affect their communities and wouldn’t stand for it. The Rhinelander Airport Manager even went as far as saying if SkyWest didn’t reinstate the original service pattern they would contact their senator and house representative to get the flights back.

The upsetting nature of the flight schedule can be seen from the airport’s point of view. Currently each community is receiving two flights a day on 50-seat jets but with the tag flights they’d have to share the seat with other communities. This would give each community affected half the seats they normally do as they would be stopping en-route to pick up other passengers in other affected EAS communities.

SkyWest hear the complaints and did end up reinstating the original schedule for all of the communities and their not-so-tag flights. However the communities will have to bite their tongues for roughly a month and learn to deal with the situation. The reinstatement of the original schedule doesn’t restart until Oct. 6 2022. So the communities mentioned above will have their very unique tag routing for just shy of a month making it even rarer for those that do end up flying on any of the routes during this short period of time.

While complaining and threatening to call a senator does work apparently the schedule doesn’t go back to 100% normality in October. Pellston Alpena Sault Ste. Marie and Iron Mountain will go back to their original nonstop flights in October other than some timing differences. Escanaba will also go back to two nonstops a day but instead of one flight a day to each Minneapolis and Detroit they will be losing their Minneapolis flight and instead have twice daily to Detroit on most days. In addition Escanaba will be losing their early morning departure and late night arrival flights with the first departure now around 1 p.m. and the last arrival for the day around 6 p.m.

Brainerd and Bemidji in Minnesota will not be reverting to their nonstop flights in October. Bemidji’s early morning departure will still stop in Brainerd on the way to Minneapolis from October until at least December of 2022. Brainerd will still not be affected at all continuing to have two flights a day to Minneapolis.

The flight schedules do change again towards the end of the year but given the ever-changing nature of the flight schedule it is not mentioning them this far in advance.

Author Joey Gerardi Joe has always been interested in planes for as long as he can remember. He grew up in Central New York during the early 2000s when US Airways Express turboprops ruled the skies. Being from a non-aviation family made it harder for him to be around planes and would only spend about three hours a month at the airport. He was so excited when he could drive by himself and the first thing he did with the license was get ice cream and go plane spotting for the entire day. When he has the time (and money) he likes to take spotting trips to any location worth a visit. He’s currently enrolled at Western Michigan University earning a degree in Aviation Management and Operations."

(NASDAQ:JKHY) After Its Third-Quarter ...,"It's been a good week for Jack Henry & Associates Inc. (NASDAQ:JKHY) shareholders because the company has just released its latest quarterly results and the shares gained 4.0% to US$169. It was a credible result overall with revenues of US$539m and statutory earnings per share of US$1.19 both in line with analyst estimates showing that Jack Henry & Associates is executing in line with expectations. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.

Check out our latest analysis for Jack Henry & Associates

Taking into account the latest results the current consensus from Jack Henry & Associates' 15 analysts is for revenues of US$2.37b in 2025. This would reflect a solid 8.4% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to ascend 11% to US$5.75. Before this earnings report the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$2.38b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$5.74 in 2025. So it's pretty clear that although the analysts have updated their estimates there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results.

The analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$181 showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. The most optimistic Jack Henry & Associates analyst has a price target of US$200 per share while the most pessimistic values it at US$170. Even so with a relatively close grouping of estimates it looks like the analysts are quite confident in their valuations suggesting Jack Henry & Associates is an easy business to forecast or the the analysts are all using similar assumptions.

Taking a look at the bigger picture now one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. The period to the end of 2025 brings more of the same according to the analysts with revenue forecast to display 6.7% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 7.1% annual growth over the past five years. By contrast our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to see their revenues grow 3.6% per year. So it's pretty clear that Jack Henry & Associates is forecast to grow substantially faster than its industry.

The Bottom Line

The most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady in line with previous estimates. Fortunately they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$181 with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.

Then with that proverbial stiff upper lip it was onto the job at hand.

Fendi is one of a number of European brands energizing New York Fashion Week this season staging a full-scale runway show and clothing collection inside a packed Hammerstein Ballroom on Friday night in celebration of the 25th anniversary of the iconic Baguette bag introduced in 1997.

Also following the money to the growing American luxury market Marni has taken its show on the road while Givenchy Courrèges Kiton and Isabel Marant are toasting new Stateside stores with dinners and parties. Munich-based luxury e-commerce site MyTheresa also planted a flag at New York Fashion Week hosting a lunch for Gabriela Hearst and celebrating overall U.S. sales rising 110 percent over the last year and a half.

Texas and Florida may be the hottest American retail markets right now but New York Fashion Week is the place to go for media heat which is why Fendi chose it to reignite the Baguette business. New York put the Fendi bag on the pop culture map thanks to a cameo in the original “Sex and the City” series.

So of course Sarah Jessica Parker was at the show — along with Kim Kardashian Kate Moss Linda Evangelista and a slew of other notables — and even created her own personalized take on the Baguette.

To further a “New York-y vibe of uptown-downtown” Jones tapped his lifelong fashion hero and former Louis Vuitton boss Marc Jacobs.

Jacobs created a collection within the collection using his love of logomania to play with the Fendi moniker on Baguettes and designing 10 looks in the spirit of his current exploration of historical romance meets street.

Jones also teamed with iconic New York jeweler Tiffany & Co. newly added to the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton brand family on Tiffany blue Baguettes with silver charms and a handmade solid sterling silver Baguette resembling a piece of jewelry itself for the ultimate collector’s item.

That connection was serendipity more or less Jones said explaining how he realized while opening the Fendi store on Fifth Avenue across from the Tiffany flagship that the Baguette is not only a bag but a diamond cut.

“I wanted to combine those three things and it’s quite playful and celebratory” he said of the Fendi Marc Jacobs Tiffany trifecta cooking up the bingeable looks.

“There’s a lot of depressing things happening in the world so I thought it was good to have a bit of fun” he said flashing a new gumball-sized Tiffany diamond on his finger.

Hitting stores next month the collection includes colorful sportswear shearling outerwear and cool tailoring all with maximalist details like tulle on top of slip skirts sequins on top of sweatshirts and boiler suits and pockets turned into Baguettes on fleece pullovers baseball hats gloves gators and socks.

“It’s been really exciting to see how a bag can be transformed into a collection” said Silvia Venturini Fendi the brand’s creative director of accessories menswear and children who created the original style as an alternative to the ’90s ubiquitous backpack — one that still allowed for hands-free movement with its ergonomic tucked-under-the-arm design.

“It was one of the first bags that was embroidered but meant to be worn during daytime so we liked the idea of having a mix of embroidery and sequins and sweatshirts” she said of the clothing collection.

New iterations of the Baguette itself include a multipocketed version souped up for today’s gadget hounds. “You have a places for your airpods your toothpicks your asthma inhaler it’s good for guys and girls and it can also be a bum Baguette” Jones said noting the adjustable strap on his personal bag in pale pink.

For his take Jacobs developed a “Fendiroma” logo. He mashed up his brand codes with Fendi’s creating a calfskin Baguette emblazoned with the words “The Baguette” playing off his “The Tote” designs as a well as an extra version dripping with Swarovski crystals.

Jacobs brought the silhouettes and fabrics from his recent ready-to-wear collections into Jones’ world using a color palette of fluro yellow silver gray and white inspired by workers on city streets and fabrics bleached or sheer overlaid he said.

“I like the idea of taking jeans jean jackets sweaters the way people really dress and instead of saying it’s such a shame that’s what people look like embracing what speaks to them and reforming it into something evocative of a period with more romance and magic” said Jacobs of what’s exciting him in fashion now.

“When you tie a coat around your waist and it creates a bustle or when you make a long skirt out of a pair of jeans there is something old and historic. But when you break up the components and you can identify them you see it’s not a costume. It’s nice to squint and see what’s in front of you in a more magical way. When I look at it I see a romantic vision of what street clothes look like.

“And when you think of New York it’s a pair of sneakers jeans a jean jacket a tote bag and a Baguette” he said. “It takes the stuffing out of European fashion.”

But probably not the dough.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhemVkZGlnaXRhbC5jb20vZmFzaGlvbi9hcnRpY2xlLzU2OTE2LzEvcGFtZWxhLWFuZGVyc29uLWFuZC1reWxlLW1hY2xhY2hsYW4tbWVldC1pbi1tYXJjLWphY29icy1oZWF2ZW7SAXlodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYXplZGRpZ2l0YWwuY29tL2Zhc2hpb24vYXJ0aWNsZS81NjkxNi8xL3BhbWVsYS1hbmRlcnNvbi1hbmQta3lsZS1tYWNsYWNobGFuLW1lZXQtaW4tbWFyYy1qYWNvYnMtaGVhdmVuP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pamela Anderson and Kyle MacLachlan meet in Marc Jacobs’ Heaven,"The label’s new AW22 collection also features collaborations with Doja Cat and Wong Kar-Wai

Text Serena Smith

It’s that time of year again: Marc Jacobs is unveiling his latest Heaven collection. This season the designer’s campaign features Pamela Anderson Doja Cat Charli XCX Dev Hynes and Kyle MacLachlan. It’s a star-studded line-up but unsurprisingly so. Jacobs’ has a rep for casting some of the most celebrated pop culture icons: Christina Ricci was unveiled as the face of Heaven in 2021; Nicki Minaj fronted his SS22 Heaven campaign; and of course Winona Ryder starred in the campaign for his J Marc bag which was released in May. Heaven has kept fans captivated by channelling 90s and Y2K nostalgia since its inception in 2020 and the new AW22 collection doesn’t disappoint: think extremely distressed denim mini skirts; delicate chokers that resemble barbed wire; lilac slip dresses paired with thick black Kiki boots.

In the campaign Anderson perches on a dark floral sheet modelling a grey co-ord trimmed with lace from the collection channelling 90s grunge. In another image she‘s draped across a dew-speckled rose cradling a pastel-coloured puffy shoulder bag. In many ways Anderson is the perfect fit for Heaven: she’s indisputably emblematic of the late 90s and early 00s zeitgeist. From that iconic red Baywatch swimsuit to her all-leather looks in Barb Wire Anderson’s style will be forever influential. She’s also no stranger to the fashion world and is close friends with Vivienne Westwood who memorably cast Pam as the face of her SS09 campaign and has appeared in numerous ad campaigns shot by Juergen Teller.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vYnJlYWtpbmdhYy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyL3NlcC8wOS9hdGxhbnRpYy1jaXR5LW1hbi1yZWxlYXNlZC1mcm9tLWphaWwtaW4tZmF0YWwtaGl0LS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Atlantic City man released from jail in fatal hit-and-run,"An Atlantic City man charged with leaving the scene of a crash that killed a pedestrian was released with conditions Friday.

Harris Jacobs 26 faces a second-degree charge in the death of Orlando Fraga who was struck at about 3:35 a.m. Sept. 4.

Fraga 76 was walking east on Atlantic Avenue when he was struck in what defense attorney Lou Barbone categorized as a “dart-out.”

“It’s a strict liability case so even if the victim were to have jumped up and down and run head-first into the car it wouldn’t really be relevant to this case” Chief Assistant Prosecutor Seth Levy told the judge. “The defendant didn’t stick around to do his legally obligated duty which is to wait for the police.”

Barbone said Jacobs did eventually leave the scene but that it was not the full story.



Surveillance video shows Jacobs pull into the Dunkin Donuts parking lot and attend to Fraga twice Barbone said reading from the investigator’s report.

Jacobs twice tried to attend to the victim and called across the street for a man who was watching to call 911 Barbone said.

“The defendant heard the male on the phone with 911” Barbone said as Jacobs nodded. “He then left the scene.”

Jacobs held his chest and rocked back and forth several times during the hearing.

Video surveillance later showed Jacobs parking at his apartment building at 600 Atlantic Ave. Levy said.

“Let’s say it’s of no fault of his own that this accident occurred” Levy told the judge. “He has the duty to wait around and wait for the police there who would then probably say ‘Gee this is a terrible accident move on with your life.

“However what he did was first look to see that the person that he hit was in extreme duress if not dead already and then flee” Levy added.

Barbone painted Jacobs as a hardworking lifelong Atlantic County resident who started his own business two years after graduating college.

He also works both as a real estate agent in Northfield and as a full-time consultant for his father’s company Pacific Outdoor Advertising.

Jacobs’ father political powerbroker Joe Jacobs was in the waiting room in case he was needed to vouch for his son Barbone said.

He said Harris Jacobs would be living with his father in Linwood if released.

The judge did determine that Jacobs was not a risk if released considering that he has no prior criminal record.

The public safety assessment used under bail reform had him at the lowest risk and recommended release on his own recognizance.

The judge put increased conditions including a monthly check-in by phone and one in person.

Jacobs can keep his license while he is released.

His next court date is Oct. 5."

They were right.

Johnson’s first year in office has been a roller-coaster ride filled with the ups of having delivered on a checklist of progressive promises — and the downs of managing contentious relationships with Gov. J.B. Pritzker the Illinois General Assembly the business community and police.

There’s even mounting tension with a City Council emboldened by Johnson’s failure to deliver on his signature promise to secure a new revenue source to combat homelessness.

In an interview with the Sun-Times and WBEZ Johnson reflected on his “remarkable journey” to the mayor’s office and the very “different trajectory” he followed to get there.

He’s proud of fulfilling so many items on his progressive to-do list and described a year of accomplishments tempered by impatience.

“There are frustrating moments that I do have where you … just wish you could address everything at the same time” Johnson said. “That’s just unfortunately not where we are — just because the damage has been so severe and it has been so widespread” especially in “historically marginalized” communities.

Johnson acknowledged he hasn’t made everybody happy but that comes with the turf.

“If the role of the mayor is to satisfy everyone then we would not have had 56 prior to me” he said.

Migrant crisis missteps

From the beginning Johnson has been dogged by the migrant crisis he inherited. One of his first Council meetings included a cathartic vote on $51 million in surplus funding for the crisis — after a contentious “us-versus-them” debate that reduced one alderperson to tears.

Johnson’s handling of the crisis telegraphed the freshman mayor’s growing pains. He unveiled plans for a winterized camp at a contaminated Southwest Side industrial site only to have Pritzker reject the idea amid environmental concerns.

The local alderperson a progressive ally felt blindsided by the mayor’s plan and was subsequently physically accosted by furious constituents.

The abandoned plan ended up costing Chicago taxpayers nearly $1 million.

But Johnson succeeded in emptying Chicago police station lobbies filled with asylum-seekers and returning Park District field houses to their intended use. He did that by opening brick-and-mortar shelters at a furious pace. At its peak 27 shelters held more than 14600 migrants.

“When I stepped into office … you had contracts that were bloated and it was costing the taxpayers an enormous amount of dollars ... We’ve transformed all of that … We’ve saved the taxpayers over 200 million dollars” Johnson said.

But the biggest shelter in Pilsen was crowded and unsanitary. A 5-year-old boy there died of sepsis and it later was the epicenter for a measles outbreak.

Alderpersons are now pushing back on the mayor’s 60-day eviction policy — which was delayed three times and already has forced more than 650 people from shelters.

Johnson also stumbled by initially reneging on a deal with Pritzker and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle one of his political patrons to provide $70 million in additional city funding to support migrants through 2024.

His first budget included just $150 million in funding he knew would last only until April 1. He deliberately low-balled the figure to put pressure on the federal government but the tactic failed. At one point he used $95 million in federal stimulus to slap an end-of-year Band-Aid on the migrant crisis. But that alienated some alderpersons who control spending and were not consulted.

Johnson’s hand-picked chair of the Council’s Immigrant and Refugee Rights Committee has frequently complained about being shut out of conversations around the migrant crisis including about the mayor’s eviction policy. Ald. Andre Vasquez (40th) eventually strong-armed the administration into publishing regular data on evictions.

“There needs to be some work done as it relates to transparency and accountability as well as cooperation and engagement and dialogue with the alders” Vasquez said. “It’s about figuring out how to engage with everybody.”

Alderpersons’ grievances with Johnson were on full display at the last Council meeting where they called for the mayor to be more forthright about migrant funding and equal spending on long disinvested communities.

Even after the griping the Council ultimately passed two of Johnson’s top spending priorities including $70 million from city reserves for migrant spending to honor the deal with Pritzker and Preckwinkle.

“I know how to count and both those votes received more than 30 votes from City Council” said Workforce Development Chair Ald. Mike Rodriguez (22nd). “That sounds like a win to me.”

After closing nearly a dozen shelters amid declining numbers Johnson said he’s “preparing” for a possible influx of migrants in the run-up to the Democratic National Convention in August. But there are “limitations to what we can do” without more federal help he said.

Progress on progressive wish list

Johnson’s legislative successes have been impressive.

In the first year alone he has: phased out the subminimum wage for tipped workers; pushed through the most generous paid leave policy in the country; reinstated the city’s Department of Environment; and laid the groundwork to reopen two shuttered mental health clinics.

The mayor has also begun to ease the pressure on Chicago police officers by expanding a plan to send mental health providers instead of police to nonviolent mental health emergencies.

Johnson kept his promise to put a binding referendum on the ballot that would have authorized the Council to increase the real estate transfer tax to create a dedicated funding source for homelessness prevention. But Chicago voters rejected it a major defeat widely viewed as a referendum on the mayor’s first year in office.

Mayoral allies in the progressive caucus heard the message loud and clear and vowed to work harder to win voters’ trust and simplify a complicated referendum that many voters didn’t understand.

“Ignoring what those critiques are and thinking that we’re just morally right isn’t going to lead to future wins” Vasquez said.

At the time Johnson responded to the defeat with bravado warning anyone who might assume one defeat would make him put the brakes on his progressive agenda to “buckle up.”

More recently the mayor won Council approval for a $1.25 billion bond issue devised by former Mayor Lori Lightfoot to fund housing and economic development programs. The same goes for Lightfoot’s plan which Johnson expanded to transform nearly vacant buildings along LaSalle Street into more affordable residential units.

Canceling the city’s contract with the gunshot detection technology company known as ShotSpotter also delivered on a progressive promise. Johnson and his base have long viewed ShotSpotter as a surveillance tool that leads to overpolicing in Black and Brown communities.

But Johnson’s decision was somewhat overshadowed by his delivery. He announced it just days before the contract was to expire then scrambled to negotiate an extension through the historically violent summer months and the Democratic National Convention.

ShotSpotter and the broken migrant funding promise with Pritzker and Preckwinkle were the subject of a disastrous Feb. 15 press conference showcasing a communication problem dominating Johnson’s first year in office.

He evaded some questions answered in platitudes and declined to say if he’d walked away from a migrant funding deal with Pritzker and Preckwinkle or nailed down the ShotSpotter extension before announcing a phase-out.

That defining moment in his relationship with the press seems to have led to a course correction. Johnson finally named a permanent communications director in Ronnie Reese who had essentially filled the role since Johnson took office. Johnson also hired a chief strategy officer Joe Calvello who learned the art of being “radically open and honest” while guiding U.S. Sen. John Fetterman D-Pa. through a difficult campaign dominated by health issues.

The changes appear to have made an impact already with Johnson taking media questions more often and answering those questions a bit more directly.

Mixed bag for business

Johnson’s aggressive agenda such as costly mandates on paid leave and the subminimum wage put him at odds with the business community.

But labor leaders said Johnson also had displayed a willingness to compromise on both issues even as business groups kept “moving the goalposts.”

“They were looking not to compromise. They’re just looking to stop the policy. And that’s not realistic” Chicago Federation of Labor President Bob Reiter said noting similar policies have been adopted by other major cities.

Johnson also appeared to extend an olive branch with recent rollouts of pro-development policies. And his choice of seasoned real estate executive Ciere Boatright as commissioner of Planning and Development also was applauded by the business community.

Besides the LaSalle Street plan the mayor proposed recommendations to cut bureaucratic red tape on business development and revived the long-stalled O’Hare expansion project by hammering out a cost-cutting deal with the major airlines.

Johnson also held the line on city property taxes — though he allowed Chicago Public Schools to boost property taxes to the limit two years in a row.

“It’s been a little bit up and down. Some positives. Some negatives” Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce President Jack Lavin said of Johnson’s first year adding that there’s “a lot of work to be done to improve communication” and trust between the mayor and the business community.

“He has a tax agenda. We have ideas on how we can grow the economy. And we’re going to have to come together because federal money is drying up. There’s lots of fiscal cliffs and fiscal challenges coming up” Lavin said.

“He’s the mayor. We’ve all got to work together. If the mayor is not successful Chicago’s not going to be successful.”

With two of four city employee pension funds hovering perilously close to insolvency Johnson has displayed some financial acumen by continuing a Lightfoot policy of making additional payments. He also appointed a working group to study the $35 billion crisis — which has yet to produce any ideas on solving it.

Goodwill from police is short-lived

Johnson’s choice of Larry Snelling as police superintendent played to rave reviews. A commanding and reassuring presence he’s already won the support of the demoralized rank and file.

The mayor also extended the police contract and sweetened police raises. But the feel-good period was somewhat short-lived.

He infuriated officers by twice asking Council members to reject an arbitrator’s ruling allowing officers accused of the most serious wrongdoing to bypass the Police Board taking their cases to arbitration.

“For a Democratic mayor to be so anti-union it’s pretty breathtaking” said Fraternal Order of Police President John Catanzara.

As expected a judge sided with the union — but agreed to make the arbitration process more public and that meant the back-to-back Council votes were more than “symbolic” Johnson said.

Johnson did keep a campaign promise to hire 200 new detectives and free officers for street duty by hiring civilians to perform office jobs. And to the consternation of some progressive allies he increased the police budget to nearly $1.99 billion.

Still Snelling told a town hall in Jefferson Park recently that Chicago remains down about 2000 officers citywide and struggles with low recruitment.

Like Lightfoot Johnson has devised a plan to get at the root causes of crime. His hyperlocal version focuses on 10 multiblock areas in four neighborhoods: Englewood Austin Little Village and West Garfield Park.

Those neighborhoods — plagued by school closings and high dropout rates while lacking public amenities like parks and libraries — will receive an array of services including priority in another round of the city’s guaranteed minimum income program.

Johnson has also put a heavy focus on creating more summer jobs and neighborhood recreational opportunities for young people to give them alternatives to an ongoing trend of mass downtown gatherings that have turned violent.

Shootings and homicides are down slightly but robberies remain stubbornly high. In neighborhoods citywide Chicagoans continue to feel unsafe waking up to reports of another wave of strong-armed robberies store break-ins and carjackings.

Reducing violent crime remains such a priority alderpersons who believe ShotSpotter is an effective prevention tool vow to perhaps symbolically defy the mayor and tie his hands on ending the contract.

Johnson plays Council tie-breaker

Twice in the first year Johnson was forced to cast tie-breaking Council votes: To save his now-ousted Zoning Chair and floor leader Ald. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa (35th) from censure; and to approve a nonbinding resolution for a cease-fire in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

The cease-fire resolution strained Johnson’s relationship with many Jewish leaders and the only Jewish alderperson Debra Silverstein (50th). Some Jewish elected officials and civic leaders — including the Anti-Defamation League Midwest state Sen. Sara Feigenholtz and state Rep. Bob Morgan — later declined the mayor’s invitation to a recent meeting meant to ease the tension.

But not supporting the resolution would have diminished his relationships with progressives and Arab Americans. He noted that calling for a cease-fire is in line with his values and that several progressive pro-Palestinian Jewish groups did attend the meeting.

“As far as me calling for peace I hardly consider that controversial. ... The entire country and people around the world are calling for that. That’s something that we value as residents of the city of Chicago but it’s also part of our responsibility as global residents that calling for peace and an end to war is a part of our very profound tradition” he said.

The Chicago area’s large Palestinian community demanded for months that Johnson and his Council majority take a stand voicing their feelings at numerous raucous Council meetings.

The division caused by the war has spread to college campuses in Chicago and nationwide foreshadowing the civil disobedience that might occur when Democrats gather here in August to formally nominate President Joe Biden for reelection.

If Johnson is too timid he risks allowing demonstrators to run roughshod over Chicago. If he allows Chicago police to be too heavy-handed he runs the risk of civil rights violations and the inevitable comparison to the disaster of the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.

Chief of staff Rich Guidice a seasoned City Hall lifer was widely expected to serve through the convention bringing the expertise garnered from guiding Chicago through decades of major events. But Guidice abruptly resigned last month.

The tie-breaking vote that spared Ramirez-Rosa from censure followed his resignation from leadership after apologizing for bullying and threatening colleagues to block a symbolic referendum on whether Chicago should remain a sanctuary city.

Johnson hasn’t named a replacement for Ramirez-Rosa — either as Zoning chair or floor leader. Some Council members are demanding a replacement from the Latino Caucus but Johnson has yet to find someone he trusts who can also win alderpersons’ support.

Meanwhile some of Johnson’s progressive supporters believe rushing to force Ramirez-Rosa’s resignation went too far and that an apology should have sufficed.

Backing Bears puzzles progressives

Progressives were also left scratching their heads when Johnson embraced the Bears’ plan for a sprawling domed stadium south of Soldier Field — a project requiring billions of state and federal dollars that haven’t been approved or identified.

When the Bears unveiled their stadium plan Johnson acted more like a cheerleader than a guardian of taxpayers and protector of precious lakefront parkland.

Asked if the plan violated the city ordinance prohibiting new construction along the lakefront Johnson referred to the Bears’ promise of increased green space on the Museum Campus. But he failed to mention that those additional 14 acres are possible only if the state and federal governments cover all $1.5 billion in infrastructure costs.

Putting the Bears stadium near the top of his legislative wish list contradicts Johnson’s campaign stance. Now though Johnson calls Soldier Field a “100-year-old building” — even though it was rebuilt in 2003. Paying off what’s owed on that renovation will drain city coffers unless the debt is refinanced in the new stadium funding package.

“If someone else has another solution that addresses this problem then they should put that on the table” Johnson said.

Every mayor loves a giant public works project. They generate jobs contracts and political donations and are a feel-good diversion from Chicago’s intransigent problems. Then-Mayor Richard M. Daley had his failed 2016 Olympic bid. Former Mayor Rahm Emanuel had Elon Musk’s high-speed tunnel train to O’Hare Airport.

Johnson’s stadium plan similarly appears to be going nowhere. Springfield has far higher priorities.

“The position he’s taking there … seems to run at odds with his key base of support from progressives. I understand the temptation and desire to put forward a signature project — a legacy project if you will … But it just seems like an unforced error in the way he rolled it out” said David Greising president and CEO of the Better Government Association.

“Unforced errors is sort of a common theme that we are seeing in many respects … Communication with the public and the press remains lacking” he said.

At the Bears’ announcement “he’s speaking in platitudes from scripted remarks and can’t really engage with the questions being asked” Greising said which is “undermining his ability to earn support from people most affected by the decisions he is making.”

Pritzker did not address the Bears stadium controversy or other points of tension with Johnson saying instead: “The first year of any administration is often the most challenging and I commend Mayor Johnson and his team for reaching this milestone.”

Springfield stumbles

A stadium defeat would not be Johnson’s first in Springfield.

Last month the Illinois House voted 92-8 to approve a bill curbing the power of Johnson’s revamped hand-picked school board. A Senate committee did the same this past week during Johnson’s first Springfield lobbying trip as mayor. The bill would prevent Chicago Public Schools from making any admissions or funding changes to selective-enrollment programs and from closing any schools until a fully elected school board takes control in early 2027.

There was no mistaking the message to Johnson’s board which wants to prioritize investing in neighborhood schools over choice schools like selective enrollments. The original bill was amended to extend an existing moratorium on closing all schools and not just selective schools after lobbying by the CTU.

Asked what message he took from the vote to tie his hands on an important education issue Johnson noted it still needs final approval.

“It’s not a law so nothing has happened” he said.

An emotional CTU President Stacy Davis Gates — perhaps reflecting on setbacks like these — told supporters last fall she was “ashamed of myself” for having helped put Johnson — “my brother” she called him — in “an impossible place.”

Asked recently what made her ashamed Davis Gates talked about the resistance Johnson had faced during his first year.

“Transformation is happening right now in Chicago and every corner of the city because of his leadership. And that level of transformation either makes you a hero or it makes you a villain” Davis Gates said. “It’s not lukewarm. It’s either hot or cold and that is a very precarious position to live in.”

Remaking Chicago Public Schools

As a candidate Johnson promised to make progressive changes to CPS and has.

His revamped board is led by former science teacher Jianan Shi who also led the parent advocacy group Raise Your Hand for Illinois Public Education. Johnson’s board is filled with others with community organizing experience.

That board has delivered on a promise to shift away from student-based budgeting that progressives argue exacerbates challenges at schools serving low-income communities and toward a need-based funding model.

But he’s already disappointed some parents by sticking with a plan for a phased-in elected school board instead of delivering that pivotal reform in one fell swoop.

Johnson will also have to find a way to deliver for the schools parents and his former colleagues at the teachers union without breaking the bank in the CTU contract he is now negotiating. Teachers started out by demanding a 9% raise or to match inflation whichever is higher.

“I know what it takes — from a teacher’s perspective as well as a parent’s perspective and a student’s perspective — to have a more transformational educational experience” Johnson said. “And that’s what our focus has to be: Funding our schools and actually transforming them so that they are fully fully expressed in an equitable way.”

CPS faces a $391 million deficit for the upcoming school year not including raises being negotiated for teachers and a 4% raise already promised to support staff. The CTA and other mass transit agencies are facing their own funding cliffs.

That’s another point of contention between Johnson and Pritzker.

The governor and others are demanding a leadership change at CTA before providing any new money. Others want to merge all four Chicago-area mass transit agencies into a single super-agency to reduce costs improve operations and create a uniform fare system.

Johnson harshly critical of CTA performance during the campaign has stuck with embattled CTA President Dorval Carter Jr. no favorite of Chicago alderpersons.

When Pritzker dared demand a leadership change the mayor replied that he alone gets to choose the CTA president adding “If people want to be mayor they should run for it.”

Room to grow into job

Johnson likes to say he intends to serve for 23 years — long enough to become Chicago’s longest-serving mayor bypassing Richard M. Daley.

But that will require him to grow and mature in the job and survive many upcoming tests. While his first budget made no real political waves the second will demand making cuts raising property taxes or finding new sources of revenue while still chipping away at his commitment to invest in people.

Despite Johnson’s gestures to the business community Greising said many business leaders he talks to “feel like they still don’t know him still don’t understand what he’s trying to do and what they can do for him — and still don’t feel heard by him.”

“Every successful mayor has found a way to have the business community with him. And this mayor so far doesn’t seem to work very hard on that” Greising said.

“We shouldn’t be all that surprised when we elect someone with his background that there’s a very steep learning curve” he said. “But … hereally needs to invest his effort into growing in those areas where he is falling short. If he doesn’t do that with urgency then it will be too late.”

Davis Gates acknowledged the growing pains.

“For so long in this city people who have needed [the most] have been told ‘no’” she said. Now after years of “demanding a thing happens fighting for a thing to happen protesting rallying door knocking” progressives are in charge.

“To make things happen those are different muscles ... The muscles that we have to develop now — not just as a movement not just as a mayor but as an entire city — is number one we’ve got to get more inclusive. We’ve got to figure out how to work past our differences.”

It will take some time for this “new formation that we have in Chicago” to settle in Johnson said.

“The way these systems have been built particularly government they have been built in a very complex way to favor the few” he said.

“There has been sort of an unfettered access of a handful of powerful people having access to the fifth floor” the mayor said. “Maybe they’re not used to sharing. And that’s going to take them some adjustment.”

Mayor's up-and-down first year in office Mayor’s up-and-down first year in office • The migrant crisis has dominated much of Johnson’s first year: The crisis exposed the growing pains of a new mayor and exacerbated historic tensions between Chicago’s Black and Hispanic communities. One key setback: Johnson’s determination to locate a migrant camp at a contaminated industrial site in Brighton Park. Gov. J.B. Pritzker canceled that project over those environmental concerns.



• It’s been a mixed bag on progressives’ wish list: Johnson was able to get the Chicago City Council to eliminate the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers and require city employers to give their employees at least 10 paid days off a year. But voters rejected his “Bring Chicago Home” referendum which would have increased the real estate transfer tax and used the money to fund programs to reduce homelessness.



• His relationship with the business community has been rocky: He enacted those costly mandates on paid leave and the subminimum wage but also helped developers with an initiative to cut bureaucratic red tape and his decision to move forward on a plan to convert some LaSalle Street office buildings in the Loop for residential use. And he broke a stalemate with United and American airlines to reduce costs and move forward with a massive multi-billion-dollar expansion and renovation of O’Hare International Airport.



• Unease about Johnson’s inexperience was soothed by some of his early appointments: Rich Guidice a City Hall veteran recently retired from the Office of Emergency Management and Communications returned as Johnson’s chief of staff though he lasted less than a year. Seasoned real estate executive Ciere Boatright became commissioner of the city’s Planning and Development Department. And Johnson’s choice as police superintendent Larry Snelling had been with CPD for years and remains popular with the rank-and-file.



• Johnson spent some of his fragile political capital in casting tie-breaking votes in the Council: One was on a symbolic resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. The mayor’s other tie-breaking vote was to save Ald. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa from censure. The alderperson Johnson’s floor leader was accused of bullying some fellow members.



• Every mayor loves a big jobs-creating public works project: Richard M. Daley had his Olympic bid Rahm Emanuel had his high-speed tunnel to O’Hare that Elon Musk was going to build. Johnson’s appears to be the Bears’ bid for a new lakefront domed stadium but jumping on board so soon when the level of public funding is so high — and still in doubt “seems like an unforced error” said David Greising president and CEO of the Better Government Association.



• Johnson’s experience as a teacher plays a role: Johnson a former organizer for the Chicago Teachers Union owes his election in part to the support of that union and entered office with teachers’ support. And while he has remade the CPS board — and the board has shifted schools to a need-based funding formula he also disappointed parents by backing away from shifting to an all-elected school board right away opting instead to phase in elected members.

Fisher said there’s no estimate for how many homes were affected by the storm which produced hail around 5-6 inches in Johnson City.

Throughout the community of 1800 people trees and bushes battered by rain and hail have left leaves and debris scattered across lawns and roads.

Fisher said to her knowledge there were at least 35 homes she’s aware of that were hard hit with hail. She said the strong natural force punctured metal roofs and shattered numerous windshields.

“We had a piece of hail that was so large it punctured through their metal roof and into their drywall. That couple had a lot of water damage there’s so many homes with water damage” Fisher said.

Fisher said the city’s goal right now is to help residents cover and patch the holes in their roofs from the storm.

“Our focus right now is helping our residents do what they need to do to get their roofs patched for now. Look for a long term solution of getting those repaired and finding ways to help them pay for it” Fisher said.

Fisher asks anyone whose property was damaged in the storm to not only report it to their insurance provider but also the Texas Department of Emergency Management.

The Blanco County Office of Emergency Management shared a link to TDEM’s iSTAT Damage Surveys page via social media Thursday night.

In the event that the city and county declare an emergency Fisher said officials would have to prove there was $52000 worth of damage done to uninsured properties in the area.

She predicts damage will easily pass that threshold which could happen even faster with prompt reporting.

CHICAGO (WLS) -- Mayor Brandon Johnson's pick to serve on the board of the Regional Transportation Authority is coming under fire.

He's tapped a well-known West Side pastor for the job.

But some Chicago aldermen argue that he's not ready to get behind the wheel especially after some comments that's he's made about riding the CTA.

The Rev. Ira Acree is a longtime well-known pastor and community organizer on the West Side.

He hopes to take on an additional role as a board member for the Regional Transportation Authority the governing body that oversees CTA Metra and Pace. Acree was nominated by Mayor Johnson.

""With Rev. Acree being a member of this community we definitely support him because he knows the challenges that people and communities face. It doesn't have to be a transit expert"" 28th Ward Ald. Jason Ervin said.

As members of City Council's transportation committee learned Wednesday Acree is far from a transit expert. While he grew up using public transportation Acree told the committee as an adult he occasionally uses it downtown.

""As a man I don't have to use the CTA. I'm fortunate to have a car"" Acree said.

While transportation is facing a crisis Acree said he needs more information to make any judgments about CTA Chief Dorval Carter or an effort in Springfield to consolidate the RTA CTA and Pace.

""You actually have to have knowledge about what's happening to the whole RTA system and to not have any answers at all was a little bit offensive"" 32nd Ward Ald. Scott Waguespack said.

In addition Waguespack was disappointed Acree was unaware of an RTA $730 million shortfall.

""This is the first time hearing of a 730 shortfall; I wouldn't want to respond without doing research"" Acree said.

Before appearing before the committee Acree admitted he never spoke with the mayor about the administration's transportation vision.

""I think a mayor and administration need to be reaching out and the fact that they haven't says a lot about things"" 40th Ward Ald. Andre Vasquez said.

""We have hundreds of people in this city thousands regionally who could take on this job and have the knowledge on day one walking into it. And I think that's where the mayor's office failed"" Waguespack said.

Waguespack and Vasquez were the only two committee members to vote against Acree's appointment. Others say serving on the RTA board doesn't require expertise.

""You can purchase expertise but you can't purchase that people have known understanding of the community on the South and West sides"" Ervin said.

Acree said he is not making himself available for interviews until his appointment is confirmed by the full City Council.

With the exception of a few aldermen Acree's nomination is expected to pass.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWJsb2NrLmNvL3Bvc3QvMjkzNjQzL3doaXRlLWhvdXNlLXNldC10by1ub21pbmF0ZS1jZnRjLWNvbW1pc3Npb25lci1qb2huc29uLXRvLXRyZWFzdXJ5LXJvbGUtYmxvb21iZXJn0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlYmxvY2suY28vYW1wL3Bvc3QvMjkzNjQzL3doaXRlLWhvdXNlLXNldC10by1ub21pbmF0ZS1jZnRjLWNvbW1pc3Npb25lci1qb2huc29uLXRvLXRyZWFzdXJ5LXJvbGUtYmxvb21iZXJn?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,White House set to nominate CFTC Commissioner Johnson to Treasury role: Bloomberg,"The White House is set to nominate Commodity Futures Trading Commission's Kristin Johnson to a top position at the U.S. Treasury Department Bloomberg reported on Thursday.

The announcement of Johnson's nomination is expected to be made public soon Bloomberg reported citing people who asked for anonymity to speak on the topic. Johnson did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Block.

The Treasury's Office of Financial Institutions helps form policy with a focus on cybersecurity and the assistant secretary oversees a policy portfolio that includes banks credit unions insurance and consumer protection.

The position was previously held by Graham Steele who left the role in January according to multiple news reports. In a speech earlier that month Steele urged U.S. lawmakers to develop standards to regulate crypto.

Last week Waters sent a letter to President Joe Biden pressing him to nominate Johnson a Democrat to serve as the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the Treasury Department.

Waters said Johnson has provided the committee with her expertise on a number of topics from data privacy to AI to digital assets.

""In her role as CFTC Commissioner Commissioner Johnson has prioritized maintaining the integrity of our financial markets"" Waters said.

Johnson’s bootcut denim threw it back to my high school days boasting a light-washed hue that’s ideal for spring and summer. If you’ve been sleeping on bootcut pants it’s time to revive them. They’re some of the most flattering pants you can own since they’re fitted throughout the hips and thighs while featuring a leg-lengthening flare.

Johnson’s bottoms cascaded to the floor and dragged behind her but that’s customizable depending on your height and desired fit. Either way style your comeback jeans with a bodysuit or off-the-shoulder blouse for a sleek finish. I love pairing my bootcut denim with kitten heels for an added boost of height though sneakers are just as good—and Johnson proved it.

The actress slipped on a pair of comfortable Nike sneakers that included a grippy bottom and crawling toe cap. Her footwear nods to popular model-approved styles leaning into the chunky dad look that fashion has come to know and love.

These can be turned on or off regardless of whether you know your PS4's parental control password.

If you don't remember the passcode you'll need to restore default settings.

Parental controls can be a godsend helping parents limit what their kids can do on a variety of devices including PCs smartphones and gaming consoles like the PS4.

On the PS4 they help control screen time and the kind of content young players are exposed to. If you enabled parental controls at some point in the past and now want to remove them here's what you need to know.

How to turn off parental controls on a PS4 with the passcode

The default passcode for parental controls (the PS4 calls these controls ""Family Management"") is ""0000"" but you're given an opportunity to change it when you turn on parental control restrictions.

That's a good idea because the default passcode is not only easy to guess but the PS4 also displays the default passcode on every parental control passcode screen.

If you know it turning off this feature is easy.

1. Using the controller select Settings.

2. Select Parental Controls/Family Management.

The default passcode isn't much of a secret since it's displayed on the passcode screen. Dave Johnson/Insider

3. Select PS4 System Restrictions.

4. Enter the passcode.

There are a slew of parental controls in the Parental Controls/Family Management Settings menu. Dave Johnson/Insider

5. Now you're in the PS4 System Restrictions menu. There's no single ""turn it all off"" switch. Instead you need to select each item on this page and turn off the parental control restriction if it's enabled.

Work your way through the PS4 System Restrictions turning off any controls you previously enabled. Dave Johnson/Insider

6. For example select New User Creation and Guest Login then select Allowed. Press the Back button and then repeat this for ""Web Filter"" ""Default Parental Controls"" and so on.

Most parental controls are either ""allowed"" or ""not allowed."" Dave Johnson/Insider

7. When you change the status of all the entries on this page to Allowed you've turned off all of the parental controls.

How to turn off parental controls on a PS4 without the passcode

If you don't have the passcode the only way to disable parental controls is by resetting the PS4 to its factory conditions.

Note: Deactivating your primary PS4 will result in the deletion of offline saved progress and installed games. Restoring default settings will erase offline saved game progress.

1. Using the controller navigate to Settings.

2. Select Account Management.

3. Select Activate as Your Primary PS4 and choose Deactivate.

4. You may need to sign back in with your user account. After that navigate back to Settings.

5. Select Initialization.

6. Select Restore Default Settings. Be sure not to select Initialize PS4 because that will completely erase your PS4's hard drive.

Choose to restore the default settings which will reset the parental controls passcode to ""0000."" Dave Johnson/Insider

7. After the restore is complete the parental controls password will be reset back to ""0000."" You can now follow the instructions for turning off parental controls with a passcode listed above.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The investment was made as part of a Series D-2 round led by Casdin Capital and Transformation Capital. LetsGetChecked closed a $150 million Series D round last year building on raises in 2018 2019 and 2020.

WHAT THEY DO

LetsGetChecked offers at-home tests including ones for sexual health cholesterol diabetes fertility hormones and COVID-19. Users can mail their samples and receive results online within days. Depending on test results patients can consult with nurses on next steps.

The company also provides a virtual pharmacy for drugs like erectile dysfunction medications and contraceptives as well as a B2B service for health plans employers providers and the public sector.

""Timely access to clinical testing has a critical role in improving employee health. When patients delay or forgo recommended or routine tests the consequences can be significant as we have seen from the uptick in cancer diagnoses and disease progression during the COVID-19 pandemic"" Morgan Health CEO Dan Mendelson said in a statement. ""LetsGetChecked is designed to serve and meet employees wherever they are and most importantly in the convenience and ease of their home to make sure that they get the care they need.""

MARKET SNAPSHOT

LetsGetChecked an Irish unicorn founded in 2015 has made multiple acquisitions so far this year. In March the company announced it would move into genomics with the purchase of Veritas Genetics and Veritas Intercontinental.

""By integrating Veritas Genetics' and Veritas Intercontinental's genetics offering with our scalable virtual care infrastructure we are able to leverage the power of whole genome sequencing to launch a full lifecycle of personalized healthcare which has always been our goal"" Peter Foley LetsGetChecked CEO and founder wrote in an email to MobiHealthNews at the time.

It also recently completed the acquisition of BioIQ a company that works with employers and health plans to offer lab testing health screening and vaccination services.

But like a number of other digital health and health tech companies over the past few months LetsGetChecked laid off an undisclosed number of workers earlier this summer. The company told the Business Post the reductions came as a result of the recent acquisitions.

LetsGetChecked isn't alone in the home diagnostics space. Competitors include Everlywell Cue Health and traditional lab company Labcorp.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2J1c2luZXNzam91cm5hbC5jb20vRGFpbHkvSXNzdWVzLzIwMjIvMDkvMDkvVGVjaG5vbG9neS91cy1vcGVuLWNoYXNlLWNoYXJnZWZ1emUtbW9iaWxlLWNoYXJnZXJzLWZhbnMuYXNweNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. Open Fans Have Access to Portable Chargers Thanks to ChargeFuze,"Attending the U.S. Open can mean a long day for tennis fans. Matches typically start as early as 11 a.m. with night sessions not starting until 7 p.m. Even staying for just one match could get a fan their money’s worth such as this week’s men’s singles quarterfinal between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner that lasted 5 hours and 15 minutes before Alcaraz took victory at 2:50 a.m. in New York.

The early morning classic marked the latest finish ever at the U.S. Open and the second-longest match in the tournament’s history after Stefan Edberg and Michael Chang dueled for five hours and 26 minutes in 1992. Most fans at that match likely didn’t carry a cell phone let alone a smartphone that’s their lifeline for ticket entry mobile payments course maps and of course — the battery-draining process of documenting their experience on social media. That’s why U.S. Open sponsor JPMorgan Chase is serving 5000 free portable phone chargers per day throughout the tournament for on-site fans to rent from ChargeFuze.

“Because people come to the Open and spend on average five six seven hours here and your phone is really part of the experience now we've been providing charging to make sure your phone is readily available to you” Kate Schoff JPMorgan Chase’s executive director of sports and entertainment marketing tells SportTechie. “It's a survival method these days it seems to have a charged phone. When we think about our sponsorships and how we activate we're looking to do things that either enhance an experience or alleviate pain points in someone's live experience on site.”

Chase is covering the cost through its contract with ChargeFuze to provide chargers free to fans at the U.S. Open which ends Sunday. Schoff expects to see the mobile chargers used by 50000 total fans across the three-week event (including the fan week in August).

Fans can grab the chargers at one of 16 Chase-branded kiosks throughout USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center simply by sending a text message and having the charger drop from the kiosk for them to plug into their phone. Bins are located throughout the facility for fans to return their charger before they exit the grounds. ChargeFuze estimates that fans return over 90% of their batteries at the U.S. Open. Unlike other locker phone charging or other stationery units that have become popular in public spaces such as airports ChargeFuze is untethered and taken on the go without leaving your phone.

“Making the charging system mobile was important to us. You're here at the U.S. Open to watch tennis or to eat or hang out on the grounds” Schoff says. “You don't want to be tied to somewhere that you're either stuck there with a cord in your phone and can't walk away or you need to leave your phone and then come back and get it later.”

Brandon Afari a CPA who previously worked at Deloitte was inspired to pursue the idea for ChargeFuze after he spent time traveling across Asia and Europe and noticed the popularity of shared electric scooters such as Lime and Bird which users rented by scanning QR codes. He started ChargeFuze in 2018 alongside his co-founder Ryan Levy. They’ve known each other since they attended the same middle school and high school in Sherman Oaks California. Similar to transportation-sharing services like Lime scooters or Citi Bike the ChargeFuze mobile app displays a map with available charging units in the user’s nearby location.

“We view that the charging locker model is an antiquated solution. Especially nowadays too if your life is on your phone why would you leave your phone within a locker?” says Afari 28. “Our real goal is making sure that you're always mobile. Scan a QR code within seconds get a battery and be on the way and drop it off anywhere in the city.”

Normally ChargeFuze’s user fee starts at $1 for 30 minutes meaning the average smartphone can reach full battery during an hour for $2. Chase began deploying ChargeFuze on a smaller scale during the 2021 U.S. Open (roughly 3500 available chargers per day.) This year’s tournament is the first major sports event in which ChargeFuze is using text messaging instead of QR codes for charger access a decision Chase made through the customizable software provided by ChargeFuze. But QR codes remain the standard for ChargeFuze’s other activations across stadiums casinos restaurants and shopping malls through its deals with Westfield and Simon Malls.

“We definitely noticed the acceleration of user acquisition from a QR integration standpoint post Covid” says Levy 29. “Before Covid Americans across the board especially over the age of 35 understood what a QR code was maybe but wouldn't interface with them in different walks of life. Dining TV commercials billboard advertisements -- now a QR code almost serves as a call to action. I think one of the silver linings was that people tend to know what to do when they see a QR code much quicker now.”

The 2021 U.S. Open marked the widespread debut of ChargeFuze at an on-site event but the company also had small presences dating back to the January 2020 Rose Bowl shortly before pandemic shutdown live events. “2020 was really difficult for us and so was the first half of 2021"" Levy says. ""People weren't going to not just events but people weren't really leaving their home and going to any of the businesses whether it be restaurants or bars or nightlife and hospitality or malls. People weren't going anywhere that ChargeFuze is offered.”

ChargeFuze has an oversees manufacturing partner that makes its devices which have powered more than 20 million minutes of charging for users since Q4 2021.

The company has activated in more than 50 pro sports venues across NFL NBA MLB NHL and MLS such as:

Crypto.com Arena

SoFi Stadium

Allegiant Stadium

Gillette Stadium

Spectrum Center

Hard Rock Stadium

Fiserv Forum

Banc of California Stadium

American Airlines Center

Rocket Mortgage Field House

Petco Park

Globe Life Field

Madison Square Garden named ChargeFuze its “official on-the-go mobile charging partner” in August in a deal that saw 10 ChargeFuze kiosks added throughout the arena. The company raised $5 million in May from investors that included NBA player Terry Rozier former NBA player and broadcaster Kenny Smith Walt Disney parks and resorts’ former president of worldwide operations Al Weiss and Cameron Azoff whose father is Oak View Group co-founder and former Ticketmaster CEO Irving Azoff. ChargeFuze also has plans to begin its international expansion in Europe through its deal with ASM Global which operates 350 sports and entertainment venues globally.

“Right now there's two models” Arari says of ChargeFuze’s business. “It's the rentals of the batteries and then a lot of these venues too will essentially buy our stations and they collect a majority of the revenue share. A lot of times sponsors like to put their money into things that are a necessity"" he adds. ""I do think that we're going to be a category and a big category especially because of this mobile aspect that people are able to take advantage of.”

In addition to JPMorgan Chase at the U.S. Open ChargeFuze’s other sponsored activations include when Verizon Up members were offered free rentable chargers at January’s NHL Winter Classic and fan fest at Target Field. Outside of sports this summer’s Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival in San Francisco saw ChargeFuze supply chargers in partnership with rolling papers brand Zig-Zag.

“We're not doing any sort of re-targeting with the data around the charger rentals but we're just using the generic data to understand fan behaviors to inform sort of quantities locations on site for next year and how we can continue to improve the program” Schoff says of Chase which has brand ambassadors on-site at the Open to re-stock ChargeFuze kiosks with fully charged batteries.

“I myself have seen people as young as 13-14 years old using ChargeFuze sometimes maybe even younger. And I've seen people over the age of 90 on their own interfacing with ChargeFuze” added Levy. “You effectively are at a disadvantage if you don't have a smartphone in terms of interacting and engaging with your daily life—whether it's ticketing ride sharing working banking social media communicating—everything has gone digital and is done from your handheld. Ultimately anybody with a phone will warrant demand for our utility. So we really do cater to the masses.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMTAvYnVzaW5lc3MvZGVhbGJvb2svdGVubmlzLWlzLWEtZmFpbGluZy1idXNpbmVzcy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wall Street's Favorite Sport Is a Failing Business (Published 2022),"The DealBook newsletter delves into a single topic or theme every weekend providing reporting and analysis that offers a better understanding of an important issue in business.

Why it matters: These moves signal that we’ve shifted into a new chapter of the pandemic — and that employers are desperate to get people back to the office.

Employers are trying to reduce any barriers to entry for new hires says Erin Grau co-founder of Charter a media and services company focused on the future of work who's hearing from executives who are dropping their mandates.

The requirements are also expensive and time-consuming for employers — another reason to stop she adds.

What's happening: “[Companies] decided that the rationale for [mandates] had become weak enough that they don’t want to continue” Jeff Levin-Scherz population health leader at Willis Towers Watson tells Axios.

Yes but: There's a risk that dropping these requirements would make some workers less willing to mingle with their colleagues — for fear of becoming sick.

Companies mostly don't want to talk about this seeing little upside given the controversial history of mandates. But a few large employers' plans are public:

Starting this week Goldman Sachs lifted vaccination requirements everywhere but New York City where it still has a mandate for workplaces.

""With many tools including vaccination improved treatments and testing now available there is significantly less risk of severe illness"" Goldman told employees in a memo announcing the change obtained by Axios.

In June Cisco stopped requiring vaccination for ""office entry travel event attendance or visiting customers partners and other third parties” per its website.

JPMorgan Chase said it would start hiring unvaccinated individuals again back in March.

Zoom out: The White House yesterday called on businesses to take certain actions to protect employees and customers from COVID-19 this fall. Mandates weren't on the list.

Instead the administration says employers should be ""helping their employees access updated COVID-19 vaccines."" The White House also recommends employers share information on treatment options and improve indoor air quality as well as provide paid time off for anyone getting a shot.

There are other things employers can do as well like telling people not to come in if they're sick and ""if possible offer remote work for those with symptoms"" says Dr. Leana Wen a public health professor at George Washington University.

Between the lines: Things have changed a lot since these mandates were first put in place last year — a time when vaccination was seen as very effective against spreading disease. Now with the variants that's less true Wen says.

""At this point in the pandemic the case for vaccine mandates is much weaker than it was in 2021"" she adds.

But not all companies are giving up on mandates. Many hospitals and other healthcare providers do require vaccination.

Google Edelman and Facebook told Axios Seattle reporter Melissa Santos that employees who enter the office must be vaccinated.

Seven other employers she contacted were less forthcoming.

Microsoft which has set a standard that employees spend 50% of their time in the office declined to comment.

Salesforce which runs Seattle-based Tableau would only say they follow all state and local health requirements. (Most private employers aren’t required to impose vaccine mandates.)

The bottom line: We're in a new era — for now. Everyone's watching to see what happens with cases in the fall.

Editor’s note: This story has been corrected to remove a reference to Boeing requiring employees to be vaccinated. Boeing dropped its vaccine requirement in 2021."

VMware Cloud on AWS Integration For NetApp ONTAP AWS and VMware continue to double down on their joint technology and go-to-market strategic partnership year after year. In August AWS and VMware created a jointly engineered network file system (NFS) datastore option for VMware Cloud on AWS to boost migrations to the cloud. The new Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP is managed service that allows customers to run NetApp ONTAP file systems on AWS. With the integration customers can attach high-performance storage independent from their compute resources to VMware Cloud on the AWS Software Defined Data Center. AWS said partners and customers can scale or burst storage-heavy data sets with the flexibility to define performance and storage requirements to meet storage needs without added infrastructure costs. Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP supports ONTAP’s data management capabilities such as snapshots cloning and replication as well as its storage efficiency features such as deduplication and compression.

5 New AWS Controllers For Kubernetes Now Available AWS recently made five AWS Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK) service controllers generally available. Customers can now provision and manage AWS resources using ACK controllers for: Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) AWS Lambda AWS Step Functions Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP) and AWS Key Management Service (KMS). AWS Controllers for Kubernetes lets customers define and use AWS service resources directly from Kubernetes clusters. With ACK partners can take advantage of AWS managed services for their Kubernetes applications without needing to define resources outside of the cluster or run services that provide supporting capabilities such as databases or message queues within the cluster. In total ACK now supports 12 AWS service controllers with an additional 13 in preview according to AWS.

Amazon Inspector Support For Microsoft Windows OS Amazon and Microsoft are the two most dominant forces in the cloud world today via AWS and Azure. Although the two technology giants go toe-to-toe for global market share leadership both companies need to offer support for their joint customers. In September Amazon added support for Microsoft Windows Server 2012 2012 R2 2016 and 2019 2022 to its Inspector offering for continual EC2 vulnerability scanning. Amazon Inspector is a vulnerability management service that continually scans AWS workloads for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure. Windows instances will now automatically and continually be scanned for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure. New customers can get started with Inspector with a single click in the AWS Management Console to start assessing for software vulnerabilities in their EC2 instances—both Windows and Linux—along with their container images in the Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR). Inspector provides a highly contextualized vulnerability risk score by correlating vulnerability information with environmental factors such as external network accessibility to help customers prioritize the highest risks.

Amazon MemoryDB for Redis Now HIPPA Eligible For AWS channel partners focused on the healthcare industry Amazon MemoryDB for Redis is now a HIPAA-eligible service. Amazon MemoryDB for Redis is an in-memory database service promising ultra-fast performance that is purpose-built for modern applications with microservices architectures. Partners and customers can now use MemoryDB to store process and access protected health information (PHI) and power secure healthcare and life sciences applications. The new HIPAA eligibility applies to all AWS Regions where MemoryDB is available.

AWS Fargate Support For Microsoft Windows Server 2022 Another new AWS offering for Microsoft recently launched is AWS Fargate support for the Microsoft Windows Server 2022 runtime platform for applications running on Amazon Elastic Container Services (Amazon ECS). AWS Fargate is a serverless containers platform where customers do not need to set up automatic scaling groups or manage host instances for their application running on containers. By running Windows Server 2022 with AWS Fargate customers can reduce their server core container image RTM [reverse time migration] layer by up to 33 percent according to AWS enabling a reduction in the overall image size. With the new AWS support for Microsoft customers also receive benefits such as improved networking and a longer support cycle of five years for mainstream and five years of extended support. The new support adds to AWS’ list of already supported Windows Server 2019 runtime platforms for AWS Fargate and helps customers take advantage of the latest Windows features on AWS Fargate.

New Amazon EKS Anywhere Packages AWS recently launched the Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Services (EKS) Anywhere Curated Packages for partners and customers. The new software packages are open-source and extend the core functionalities of Kubernetes. Customers can now install the Harbor package as a local container registry; the Emissary-Ingress package as the ingress controller; and the MetalLB package as the service type load balancer. The EKS Anywhere Curated Packages are container images that Amazon built from open-source source code and test for compatibility at each new EKS Anywhere release. The list of curated packages starts with networking software and container registry but AWS plans to add more software in the future to allows customers to monitor the health of the EKS Anywhere clusters manage certificates and secretes and deploy stateful applications with CSI drivers. The EKS Anywhere Curated Packages are only available to customers with the Amazon EKS Anywhere Enterprise Subscription.

New On-Ramp Support For AWS Outposts Starting on Sept.1 customers now have the ability to leverage AWS’ Enterprise On-Ramp Support or Enterprise Support to satisfy the prerequisite for ordering AWS Outposts. AWS Outposts provides AWS infrastructure and services to nearly any on-premises or edge location for a consistent hybrid IT experience. With the addition of Enterprise On-Ramp Support customers now have more flexibility in selecting the AWS support plan that best suits their Outposts workloads and needs. Enterprise On-Ramp Support is a relatively new AWS Support tier to help customers who are starting their cloud journey and need expert guidance including 24/7 access to support engineers. Customers also get access around consultative architectural guidance operations reviews cost optimization recommendations and event management support delivered by technical account managers.

Amazon Managed Blockchain Now Available In U.S. West AWS partners working with U.S. government agencies or private enterprises that work for government agencies in the western part of the U.S. can now leverage Amazon Managed Blockchain (AMB) Hyperledger Fabric. With the launch of AMB in AWS GovCloud (US-West) Region customers in both public and commercial sectors can create and manage production-grade blockchain infrastructure with just a few clicks. The company’s GovCloud regions are designed to host sensitive data regulated workloads and address stringent U.S. government security and compliance requirements. This marks the first time AMB is generally available to customers in AWS’ GovCloud U.S.-West region. The Amazon Managed Blockchain service makes it easy to join public networks or create and manage scalable private networks using the popular open-source frameworks Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum. With the Hyperledger Fabric private blockchain offering once a customers’ network is up and running AMB helps make it simple to manage and maintain the blockchain network including critical tasks like managing certificates and facilitating network governance to add or remove member organizations from the blockchain network. Public sector customers—including government agencies and private enterprises that work for government agencies—will now be able to leverage the benefits of blockchain technology and deploy production workloads to achieve various outcomes such as track-and-trace of supply chains trade finance as well as clearing and settlement of financial assets.

Amazon Connect Now Detects Fraud Risk Amazon Connect’s Voice ID feature uses machine learning to provide real-time caller authentication and fraud risk detection to make voice interactions faster and more secure. In September AWS created a new capability for Amazon Connect Voice ID to now detect fraud risk from voice-based deception techniques such as voice manipulation during customer calls. The revamped Amazon Connect Voice ID can detect in real-time if an imposter is using a speech synthesizer to spoof a caller’s voice and bluff the agent or Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system. When a fraud is detected Voice ID flags these calls as high risk in the Amazon Connect agent application enabling customers to take additional security measures or precautions. This new feature works out-of-the-box once Voice ID fraud detection is enabled for a contact with no additional configuration is required.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Tampon Market Overview:

Tampons are a feminine hygiene product inserted into the vagina used to absorb menstrual fluid. When a tampon is used as intended the vagina maintains it in place as it expands to take up the menstrual fluid. Tampons are often made of rayon or a blend of rayon and cotton. The absorbency of tampons is rated on a wide scale. To make insertion easier some tampons come with an applicator. The end has been knotted with a string to make it simple to draw out the tampons.

The only type of cotton used to make tampons right now is organic cotton. Tampons made from organic cotton are produced on farms that do not use synthetic fertilizers or pesticides. Fashions made of non-organic materials usually use cotton and rayon. Tampons made of organic cotton seek to be more environmentally friendly by using no plastic.

“I love to plan images” she says. “I love to dream them [and] I love to draw them before shooting.”

More from Variety

Villeneuve’s short film “III” debuted at the 79th Venice Film Festival where she competed as the only Canadian entry in Venice’s Horizons competition this year.

The 26-year-old filmmaker was hesitant to explore her attraction to cinema that she’s possessed since childhood. “It took me a very long time to assume that desire” she explains.

As the daughter of Academy Award-nominated director Denis Villeneuve it was crucial for her “to develop [her] own relationship to cinema.” She would watch every movie she possibly could growing up finding inspiration from auteurs like Lynne Ramsay and Hayao Miyazaki.

“I love to pay attention to small details” Villeneuve says about her filmmaking style. “For me there are small treasures everywhere if you take the time to look like a fly or just looking at the grass can be marvelous.”

What was the inspiration behind “III”?

I wanted to explore the intensity of the relationship with my brothers. I think I was fascinated to see how I could at the same time love them so deeply and hate them so viscerally in some instances. I was fascinated by the ambivalence of this relationship and by those moments that create conflict where one’s desire comes in direct contradiction with another’s. And I decided to explore all of this through the lens of childhood memories.

Is the setting similar to the one in which you and your brothers would play?

Absolutely. We were lucky enough to spend a few years of our childhood with our playground basically [being] the forest in the yard. We always had access to nature and for me that was something so precious that I wanted to infuse the movie with; I find that those years were very formative to my relationship to living creatures and developed my sensibility in a way.

Do you have plans to expand your short film into a feature?

I don’t think it would be an expansion of this short film in particular but I’m deeply attracted to living [things]. Whether it’s insects or animals everything I’m developing right now is in relation to exploring the universe of living creatures; and I’m also still attracted to the perspective of children. So it will not be directly related but the same team will be a part of my future projects.

Do you feel any added pressure as a filmmaker because of your father and his reputation in the industry?

I don’t think so. I think it would be bad for my creative process to always have this in mind. I think one thing that has been very positive is [that] it has forced me to accept that maybe I would not meet expectations; it’s forced me to liberate myself from expectations.

When I make movies I’m just really absorbed by the universe that I’m trying to create so it doesn’t take [up] mental space. I try not to take it into consideration.

What is your dream project?

One of my brothers is a biologist and he really wants to make documentaries to bring awareness to the animal world and the environmental crisis. I have no words to describe the joy that it would be for me to be able to direct a film with him or participate in a project with him about animals. That would be a dream of mine.

Speaking at the Barclays Consumer Staples Conference in Boston Andre Maciel global chief financial officer said the expectation is the foodservice business will continue to grow at mid- to high-single digits.

“Foodservice is today a strategic more than a channel” said Miguel Patricio Kraft Heinz chairman and chief executive officer. “The first reason is because it grows about 1.5x the industry. So it’s growing or has been in the last 10 years a growing channel.

“The second is because foodservice if you do it well can become the most impressive penetration machine in market. I mean if you sell branded products then you are basically teaching consumers (about) how great our products are.”

He noted that Heinz Ketchup and Philadelphia Cream Cheese currently account for almost 80% of the company’s sales in foodservice and that 50% of those sales are branded and “front of house.”

“What is front of the house is what's on the table” Mr. Patricio said. “And if we do a good job as we are doing and we have it branded foodservice it can become an incredible way of teaching consumers about your flavors your brand. That's why we are putting a lot of emphasis on foodservice.”

Carlos A. Abrams-Rivera president of North America said Kraft Heinz made some specific changes to its foodservice business. The first was in leadership.

“We brought in new capabilities to the company” he said. “And then we were able to kind of focus our resources to areas (where) we can see a bigger potential for growth whether that is in QSR (quick-service restaurants) (or) whether it's moving from more supporting operators to actually national and regional distributors in a way that allows us to actually expand our penetration on some of our core categories.”

The second area of focus is schools specifically kindergarten through 12th grade. The company is already doing business in the channel with its ketchup Mac & Cheese and Lunchables brands but management sees opportunities for brands like Jell-O.

Finally Mr. Abrams-Rivera said that since 2019 Kraft Heinz has reduced the number of stock-keeping units in its away-from-home business by 50% in an effort to be more efficient and improve customer service.

“Today we have to make sure that we have superior products in all of our critical dip and sauces whether that is mayo ketchups and so forth” he said. “That allows us to also have an advantage as we think about this particular channel.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbHVtYmlhdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC8yMDIyLzA5LzEwL2NpdHktcmVmdWdlLWtyYWZ0LWhlaW56LXBhcnRuZXItdGFzdGUtY29sdW1iaWEtZXZlbnQvODAwMTMzOTAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,City of Refuge Kraft Heinz partner on Taste of Columbia event,"When refugees find homes in Boone County and Columbia they sometimes find jobs with local manufacturers such as The Kraft Heinz Co.

So the company partnered with City of Refuge a Columbia-based service organization for refugees to bring a taste of their cultures to Columbia via the Taste of Columbia food festival Thursday at the MU Health Care Pavilion in Clary-Shy Community Park.

""(Kraft Heinz) have been great partners with us in hiring refugees who are looking for work at the factory"" said Dan Szy City of Refuge development director. ""We were happy to put them in touch with some of the restaurants we know that are refugee-owned and operated like Tiger Chef or Syrian Kitchen.""

Since so many Kraft Heinz employees are refugees City of Refuge works with the company on a weekly basis said Sam Reitz with Kraft Heinz. The company wanted to find a way to give support to City of Refuge and landed on the food festival idea he said.

Guests of the first-ever event could try the cuisines of Korea Syria Thailand Kenya Mexico Myanmar and more. Based on the turnout it likely is something Kraft Heinz will host again next year Reitz said.

The event was genuinely international and multicultural Szy said adding he was excited about meeting with those who may or may not be familiar with the work of City of Refuge.

""We work with individuals for as long as they may need support and we tend to meet them in different stages in their experience in the Columbia community"" Szy said adding for those that are resettled in Columbia they first start working with Catholic Charities refugee services during their first few months of government-supported aid.

""We will sometimes see families as soon as that aid ends or sometimes months or years down the road as they may have a crossroads they come to.""

This can include employment health care or registering their children for school.

""We continually meet new families we have not met before"" Szy said. ""... We are always really thankful for all the support we received in this community. We are a great example of what happens when one or two people take a step or two toward neighbors in need.""

Among guests Thursday was Marjorie Dorime-Williams. She loved the opportunity to try so many different cuisines and to learn just what was available in Columbia after moving here six years ago from New York.

While she's been able to try a variety of places in town she did not know the length and breadth of what was available until Thursday she said.

City of Refuge continues expansion

When City of Refuge got its start in 2011 it conducted services from the homes of the refugees it helped. It then was able to open an office on East Sexton Road.

It now is nearing the opening of its new offices and community center in what was the former home of a Simmons Bank branch at Garth Avenue and Walnut Street as part of its $3 million capital campaign.

Services offered by City of Refuge will be uninterrupted and start in the facility on Oct. 10. Building renovations are set to start soon Szy said.

The facility will serve as a community center and will have an eventual preschool program which has a planned start date of fall 2023.

The larger facility also could give refugee entrepreneurs the space to hold pop-up events Szy said.

""We are excited about the new building. We know it is going to be an opportunity the community will rally around"" he said. ""We have already seen that. It is a great opportunity to tell our story as an organization and tell the stories of the families we work with.""

The former bank's lobby will be the resale area and free-item distribution such as kitchen items and clothing. The community center and adult learning classrooms will be in the two-story section of the facility east of the bank's lobby while City of Refuge expects the preschool to be housed in the building that faces Walnut Street Szy said.

City of Refuge through its staff and volunteers serves more than 1200 resettled refugees in the Columbia area. The Garth and Walnut facility is triple the size of what City of Refuge uses now.

“The move allows us to serve more people and to meet the growing need for helping refugees in our city. And instead of just serving them we believe there is real opportunity to celebrate them"" said Debbie Beal City of Refuge director in a news release. ""With a storefront to share more of our friends’ (gifts) and skills in the community with more volunteer opportunities to walk alongside our new neighbors and with a sign shining high into the skyline — Columbia can truly be a City of Refuge.”

A KROGER worker has revealed the reason why the store’s shopping carts may come to a halt even if customers have paid for their groceries.

Shoppers have shared moments where they’ve been left in awkward situations after the supermarket's alarm has gone off.

One Kroger customer claimed that they’ve been stopped six times at the exit.

They said: “I’ve never stolen in my life!”

An employee responded: “The carts automatically go off [if] they don’t have a sensor turned off.

“That sensor is turned off when they pass through a register.”

The worker also revealed that it's designed to stop thefts but carts could come to a halt if shoppers go through the checkout lanes too quickly according to Best Life.

Redditors also claimed that the alarm may go off if shoppers buy products that have tags on them.

One claimed they were stopped when they had bought detergent.

The security guard checked their receipt before saying they could leave.

It comes as Kroger has rolled out a new shopping cart for customers to use in-store.

The major retailer first piloted KroGo in the fall of 2020 – a buggy that comes with in-built technology.

Customers scan and put the items in the cart as they go up and down the aisles.

But Kroger bosses have warned that customers should put their personal belongings in the front basket before they start shopping.

The retailer said doing this “avoids needing assistance at the checkout”.

Officials have gushed over the KroGo claiming shoppers will have the “easiest checkout ever”.

But customers that use the cart have been warned that they cannot buy items such as tobacco and hard liquor.

Store officials have warned that shoppers will need to show some form of ID if they want to buy age-restricted products such as alcohol.

EPFs were formerly known as joint high-speed vessels delivering the first ship in 2012.

The EPF’s large open mission deck and large habitability spaces provide the opportunity to conduct a wide range of missions — from engagement and humanitarian assistance or disaster relief missions to the possibility of supporting a range of future missions including special operations support command and control and medical support operations. With its ability to access austere and degraded ports with minimal external assistance the EPF provides options to fleet and combatant commanders.

With 13' (4 meters) drafts EPFs are catamarans that have performed humanitarian assistance disaster relief maritime security surveillance command and control counter narcotics and additional operations in almost every region of the world.

One unique characteristic of Apalachicola is that Austal USA has been contracted to design procure implement and demonstrate EPF 13 as an autonomous platform allowing Apalachicola to operate autonomously while retaining the capability for manned operation reducing cost and centralizing ship operations to the bridge.

“EPF 13 is derived from Austal USA’s mature Spearhead-class EPF high-speed flexible multi-hull aluminum vessel design” Austal USA President Rusty Murdaugh said. “Our team was able to leverage the platform’s core automation capabilities and develop a software and hardware solution to enable autonomous operations. Successful autonomous capability required modifications to Austal’s machinery control system and hull mechanical and electrical systems integration of L3Harris’ mission and navigational autonomy systems and General Dynamics Mission Systems’ autonomous cyber solution to create the Navy’s largest unmanned surface vessel.”

Main propulsion comes from four MTU 20V8000 diesel engines hooked up to four Wartsila steerable reversing waterjets. The propulsion system gives the Apalachicola a speed of 33 knots with 380 metric tonnes of cargo 21 knots with a mission payload of 231 metric tonnes of medical cargo and 10 knots in sea state 5. The ship has a range of 1200 nautical miles at 33 knots with a full load 4700 nautical miles at 21 knots with no cargo and 2000 nautical miles at 21 knots with a medical full cargo including 36 crew three VIP quarters and a single officer-in-charge suite 147 embarked force/medical support eight isolation/acute cargo quarters two operating rooms (one major and one minor procedure) 23 medical ward beds (in ward/ICU) 10 Care Unit beds and eight isolation/acute care berths.

The US Army has placed a second full-rate production order with Collins Aerospace for AN/PRC-162 ground radios for its Handheld Manpack and Small Form Fit (HMS) program.

The order supports the command’s communication network modernization.

It will enable interoperability with legacy waveforms such as L3Harris’ SINCGARS (Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System) and Trellisware’s TSM and WREN (Warrior Robust Enhanced Network).

“Ensuring warfighters can reliably communicate across multiple waveforms on the battlefield has been our priority for decades and is even more critical to the success of JADC2” Collins Aerospace Vice President and General Manager Ryan Bunge said.

“We remain committed to delivering advanced communications capabilities to the Army that are not only feature-rich but also provide streamlined installation and lower integration costs” he added.

In 2019 the US Army awarded Collins Aerospace a $12.7 billion maximum firm-fixed-price contract to deliver the PRC-162s.

“Success in today’s multi-domain battlespace depends heavily on secure and reliable communications” Collins Aerospace Mission Systems President Phil Jasper said at the time.

The contract has an estimated completion date of March 2026.

Pittsberg PA. - This state-of-the-art L3Harris driving simulator allows the Division to manufacture and manipulate the driving situation and conditions as well as the vehicle being operated by the driver. A multitude of levels of impairment and or distractions impacting the driver can then be programed by the trainer. The advanced technology in the simulator produces a driving experience as close to operating a real vehicle than any previous technology on the market.

The Delaware Division of Alcohol and Tobacco Enforcement has also used the Simulator to train officers in pursuit scenarios and to train the alcohol industry (servers & sellers) on the dangers associated with over-service.

The simulator program allows drivers to experience what can happen when they operate a vehicle under the influence of alcohol or distracted by a cellphone. Vision braking and steering are impacted by the various levels of impairment and demonstrate the dangers in a virtual training scenario.

DATE Director John Yeomans said the program will be available to schools Delaware Department of Education statewide driver education programs community groups law enforcement agencies and members of the alcohol industry.

“We had a vision about this program several years ago” Yeomans said. “As an alcohol law enforcement agency we felt it was important to be creative and engaging when addressing impaired and distracted driving mainly with our youth but also exposing our alcohol industry members to the dangers associated with overservice of alcohol to patrons and/or minors.”

This award will be presented as part of the NLLEA Conference and President’s Reception being held Monday September 26 2022 from 6pm-8pm at the Sheraton Hotel at Station Square in Pittsburgh PA (300 W Station Square Dr Pittsburgh Pennsylvania 15219).

The US government’s Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act 2022 aims to incentivize technology companies to build semiconductor factories in the country. However companies accepting federal funding for the same are barred from building high-tech facilities in China for the next 10 years.

Satya Gupta chief executive and founder of Electronic Products Innovation Consortium (EPIC) Foundation said that while in the short term the US will benefit from these policies in the medium term i.e. three years or more it could benefit markets like India.

“The $50 billion plus incentives from the US may be utilized by then and firms will look to expand globally and India would be a good choice. By then markets like India too will have evolved to a stage where these global firms will see benefit in setting up advanced semiconductor manufacturing here"" he said.

Introduced on 9 August the new US law comes amid tensions with China. While the scheme aims to strengthen the US manufacturing base experts believe the 10-year embargo on high-tech manufacturing in China will eventually drive firms to markets like India Europe and Vietnam.

The US scheme offers incentives totalling $53 billion (around ₹4.2 trillion) for firms building chip factories in the US. These are more than five times India’s ₹76000 crore (approximately $10 billion) production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for chipmakers announced earlier this year.

Among the world’s top 10 chip design and manufacturing firms US chipmakers earned 33.2% of $59.5 billion that global semiconductor companies earned in 2021 according to an April 2022 report by market researcher Gartner. Samsung Intel SK Hynix Micron Qualcomm Broadcom MediaTek Texas Instruments Nvidia and AMD comprised the top 10. Other than Samsung MediaTek and SK Hynix the rest are American firms.

The White House said Micron and Qualcomm plan to build new facilities in the US. While Micron plans to spend $40 billion by 2030 to make memory chips in the US Qualcomm will partner with GlobalFoundries for a $4.2 billion chip-manufacturing plan in the US. Intel which initially announced a $20 billion semiconductor fab in Ohio said in June that its plan was delayed to understand the CHIPS Act. The company now plans to begin work on its factory by end-2022 and production is expected to begin by 2025.

India currently does not have an ecosystem in place for advanced semiconductor manufacturing. However conglomerates such as the Tata group and Vedanta have expressed interest in setting up chip operations here and the government has also received interest from some global firms. Commerce minister Piyush Goyal met executives of American chip companies such as LAM Research and Applied Materials on 8 September to explore greater collaboration with Indian companies.

In April Applied Materials said it plans to invest $50 million in a new research and development (R&D) facility in India while Mint reported last month that LAM Research plans to set up its second R&D facility in India this month.

“India has already introduced a production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme to attract global clients. Alongside this it’s not like India has no existing ecosystem of the semiconductor industry—the semiconductor laboratory (SCL) in Mohali Punjab manufactures semiconductor chips in partnership with local and Israeli suppliers"" noted Vivek Tyagi chairman of industry body Indian Electronics and Semiconductor Association (IESA).

Rajeev Khushu adviser and board member of IESA said that semiconductor supply chain vendors in India do not have the necessary quality to match the global standards required for making the latest generation chips. SCL for instance still makes 180nm chips at its facility.This according to both Khushu and Tyagi could see semiconductor fabs come up in India over the next five years as global tech firms look at markets beyond Taiwan Korea and China to set up advanced facilities.

“India has already seen some interest from vendors to set up assembly testing marking and packaging (ATMP) facilities in the country based on the semiconductor PLI scheme which could precede the establishment of chip factories since the latter would take larger sums of investment"" Khushu said.

Navkendar Singh associate vice-president at market research firm International Data Corp (IDC) India said “What China has succeeded in doing has been to bring down the pricing of chips thanks to vastly available and affordable skilled labour and the overall scale of manufacturing. This could be a factor that semiconductor firms struggle to meet in the immediate future.""

Singh added that moving the manufacturing of chips away to other markets (including India and the US) could see companies incur a higher cost of manufacturing.

“It is also unlikely that any company will ever put all their eggs in one basket again so India will likely not be the sole beneficiary of the US‘ new law. The overall impact could see India make gains in the semiconductor space in the long run but it will most likely not be the only nation taking advantage of the diversification of the semiconductor supply chain"" Singh added.

What distinguishes Ameren Illinois’ CLIP offering is its innovative strategic approach to engaging large energy consumers in Illinois and as a result achieving proven energy savings. The CLIP offering has led to significant and increased savings over the years — including 25 million kWh in 2018 28 million kWh in 2019 31 million kWh in 2020 and 33 million kWh in 2021.

Ameren Illinois successfully engages large customers in the CLIP offering with the following innovative elements:

Streamlined application process

Typically a customer would be required to submit one application for each project. CLIP provides an easy one-step application process for customers to submit multiple projects.

Modified program requirements

Some program requirements can provide obstacles for customer participation. Large customers can move their projects forward with modified program requirements including no minimum payback requirements incentives provided based on actual operating hours up to 85% of project costs covered and a longer timeframe to complete projects.

High touch marketing

Outreach for CLIP focuses on creating relationships between the program and large customers. With the multichannel marketing approach target customers receive emails letters and invitations to attend interactive webinars. Throughout the application process program staff are available to provide one-on-one assistance to help customers navigate the requirements.

Proactive energy management

The CLIP process challenges customers to plan energy-saving upgrades for an entire year. This encourages customers to proactively establish an energy strategy and identify larger energy savings goals.

Comprehensive energy savings

Customers are also encouraged to think outside the box and include as many energy efficiency projects as they can conceptualize. Taking a big picture approach motivates customers to identify greater opportunities and capture more comprehensive energy savings.

Competitive application process

Another innovative aspect of CLIP is that customers are competing to submit the best application possible. Customers know in advance that their application will be reviewed by program technical staff and will be judged on potential energy savings so they must have a thorough and detailed application.

Scalable model

The CLIP offering is a replicable/scalable model that could be used by other organizations who wish to target a specific customer base or market segment where they anticipate getting the most energy savings.

Over the past decade this term has become universal when describing the future of the energy industry and what is needed to combat climate change. Our communities our country and our world need to move to cleaner sources of energy — such as solar wind geothermal and hydro — that do not emit pollutants into the air and adversely affect climate change. However there are questions and concerns around the manufacturing processes for products like solar panels and wind turbines how electric vehicle (EV) batteries are produced and how these items will be recycled once decommissioned. These concerns and potential issues raise a bigger question: How clean is clean energy?

What is considered clean energy?

Clean energy is generally defined as energy that emits a minimal amount of or no contaminants and pollutants into the atmosphere soil and water. Some well-known examples of clean energy generation include solar energy wind energy geothermal biomass and hydropower. These energy sources all use natural renewable elements to generate power with no emissions or in the case of biomass net zero emissions. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration clean energy sources are gaining traction in the United States — representing nearly 13% of total energy consumption as depicted in the figure below.

The dirty challenges

Despite the best intentions of the clean energy movement there is still a great deal of work to do to make these energy sources cleaner from cradle to grave. China is the world’s dominant manufacturer of solar panels and uses electricity from coal-burning power plants to support the silicon wafer cell and panel manufacturing processes. The rapid increase in demand for solar panel installations over the past several years has forced these manufacturers to ramp up production — thereby also increasing electricity consumption and carbon emissions. And for wind turbine manufacturing the production process has the potential to emit hazardous air pollutants such as xylene and ethyl benzene as well as volatile organic compounds into the atmosphere.

EVs provide a path towards reducing the emission impacts of the transportation sector but they currently carry a significant environmental burden. According to a study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Energy Initiative EV battery production generates more emissions than those produced for internal combustion engine vehicles — an initial emissions debt with EVs. Additionally other concerns surrounding EV battery manufacturing include cobalt mining labor practices the environmental impacts of the lithium extraction process and the potential toxic waste from the disposal of end-of-life batteries.

Recycling is another challenge as the United States and other countries strive towards clean energy sources and net zero goals. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory wind turbine blade waste is anticipated to amount to approximately 2.2 million tons or more by 2050 — equivalent to the weight of over six Empire State Buildings in New York City. Currently there are no existing cost-effective recycling methods for wind turbine blades so blades reaching their end of life are landfilled. Solar panels face similar recycling challenges.

Shifting to the transportation sector just 5% of EV batteries are currently recycled according to 2019 data from the U.S. Department of Energy. While battery recycling has likely improved over the past two to three years it is safe to assume there is still a sizable recycling lag given the rapid rise in EV sales. Limited raw materials and regulatory policies may force EV manufacturers and other industry stakeholders to build the necessary recycling infrastructure and technologies.

An optimistic outlook on clean energy

Despite the range of challenges there is growing optimism that the clean energy movement will become more resource efficient — reducing emission levels during manufacturing processes and creating a larger number of recycling and repurposing options for parts and materials. According to the International Council on Clean Transportation the emissions from battery manufacturing are expected to decline significantly in the coming decades particularly with the use of cleaner electricity throughout the production process. In fact a 30% decrease in grid carbon intensity would reduce emissions from the battery production chain by about 17%. And even though the battery production process creates an initial emissions debt EVs overtake traditional gas-powered vehicles in just two years with fewer overall emissions and reduced impacts to the environment.

On the recycling front the U.S. Department of Energy recently announced funding to support the creation of new retrofitted and expanded domestic facilities for battery recycling. The funding will also support research development and demonstration of second-life applications — such as energy storage — for batteries previously used to power EVs. With wind power several companies are looking into options for recycling and reusing wind turbine blades to create a more circular economy. Other firms have launched fully recyclable wind turbine blades or have committed to reusing or recycling all turbine blades once decommissioned.

While not perfect clean energy initiatives are moving the needle towards increased sustainability reduced emissions and fewer environmental impacts. The replacement of fossil fuel power with cleaner more renewable sources of energy is a great start in the race to combat climate change. There’s still a significant amount of work to do but the investments being made towards clean energy by government entities utilities companies and organizations and consumers show the collective commitment to being better stewards of our world. Is clean energy really clean? Maybe not yet but we’re getting there.

Creating a military cyber force the Department of Defense relied heavily on intelligence personnel infrastructure platforms and tradecraft to build its enterprise. But just like the Army needs tanks and the Air Force needs planes to conduct missions cyber troops need their own platforms separate from the National Security Agency which conducts foreign intelligence.

Enter the Joint Cyber Warfighting Architecture (JCWA). Created around 2019 by Cybercom Commander Gen. Paul Nakasone this architecture was designed to get a better handle on the capabilities platforms and programs the command is designing and set priorities for DOD as well as the industry partners that would be building them.

As initially laid out it included four main programs: the Persistent Cyber Training Environment for conducting training and mission rehearsal Unified Platform — considered the centerpiece where data is ingested analyzed and shared — Joint Cyber Command and Control to command cyber forces and the larger cyber environment and the Joint Common Access Platform for executing offensive operations. It also included a category for tools and sensors.

A Cybercom spokesperson said the ultimate vision for JCWA has not changed since it was laid out in 2019 adding “the development of JCWA capabilities focuses on building a living architecture … By maximizing innovation JCWA can address evolving threats adapt to changing technologies and implements new tactics techniques and procedures to make timely decisions and take decisive action to defeat U.S. adversaries at speed and scale.”

The services on behalf of Cybercom — which sets the requirements and standards — and the cyber mission force procure these systems as executive agents. This creates potential integration challenges given all these capabilities must be able to interact and be compatible with each other at the joint level with joint cyber teams.

“I think it’s definitely a large feat of trying to bring together all of these service level elements into this converge warfighting platform” Chris Benney vice president at Parsons said in an interview. “If we can’t integrate these great amazing capabilities together we’re not going to be able to achieve that end state of this unified system-of-systems weapons platform and really be part of that multi-domain operations view that we have from a unified Department of Defense strategy.”

Creating the architecture has been beneficial to contractors.

“I’m really excited about that architecture and that framework specifically because it allows the industrial base to deliver capabilities at speed and scale in support of the command” Janelle Romero vice president for cyberspace operations at CACI said in an interview.

Her colleague Pete Gallagher senior vice president for technology solutions at CACI echoed these sentiments explaining it helps partners organize their approach toward software and hardware.

Aside from the major contractors that are acting as primes to develop systems such as Northrop Grumman for Unified Platform ManTech for JCAP Cole Engineering for PCTE’s larger Cyber TRIDENT effort and Two Six Technologies whose Ike platform is a key component for JCC2 several other companies are supporting the JCWA from a tools or integration standpoint.

“We’re actually actively engaged in several of the development integration of the JCWA core components across not only at the joint-like U.S. Cybercom level but also down at the DoD service executive agent level” Benney said. “We’re currently supporting the integration of our enterprise network mapping capability into the Unified Platform component as well as the JCAP or that firing platform with our access management system for the automated configuration and orchestration of the access operations.”

Benney also said Parsons is working at the strategic level to help integrate systems together engaging with working groups and the Rapid Development and Integration office within Cybercom’s J9 acquisition and technology directorate.

Others are also looking at supporting the initiative when it comes to tools and access capabilities.

“Our customers need to [have] new and novel approaches to ‘arrive on target’ evolving beyond current capabilities and current delivery infrastructure to account for defensive features seen in hard-target environments. And we find our customers looking for tools that will allow them to project power against all types of network targets” said Kevin Fogarty group chief technology officer for aerospace defense and civil operations at Dynetics a Leidos subsidiary. “Dynetics is able to combine our experience and expertise in platform development and systems analysis to create research projects that result in prototype and demonstrated next-generation access capabilities and tools.”

Sources who spoke to DefenseScoop could not think of a completely analogous setup across the DOD that resembles the JCWA. The cyber enterprise within DOD is quite unique and it includes a combatant command with service-like authorities to train and oversee joint cyber operators and operations.

Some pointed to the Special Operations Command model others pointed to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program but most recognized that there isn’t an exact replica for procuring capabilities and priorities within the DOD.

“You can search for analogues but in some ways I think it is a very unique approach that is again oriented with U.S. Cybercom specific and unique Title 10 mission” Dan Haas director in Peraton’s cyber mission sector said in an interview. “They the [combatant command] is creating the major warfighting platform that then they can move out to the service components who are going to be executing some of the missions and allow them to make limited modifications that are operationally relevant or necessary to conduct operations in this specific environment that they will be operating in.”

A weapons platform

Having initially laid out an architecture for programs Cybercom has shifted its strategic thinking recently referring now to the architecture as a whole as a weapons platform not just an architecture of disparately connected systems.

Many see this as a positive step given cyber warriors will be conducting operations from this platform in support of combatant commanders and national objectives.

“The way I see that it’s more of analogous to these larger weapons platforms we have throughout the DOD. That’s really in my opinion repositioning the focus of what the intention of it really is” Benney said.

Sources indicated that one of driving forces behind this shift was the naming of Michael Clark as the new director for the J9. Clark has a rich history with the command dating back to its predecessor organization Joint Functional Component Command – Network Warfare.

“I’m not sure everybody outside the command recognizes the importance of doing that” one industry source who requested to not be named said of Clark’s appointment to the position. “He’s been with the command the longest he’s got the most experience in the command all on the ops side. Bringing Mike over to make him the [J9] was pretty significant … it makes a lot of sense because he knows JCWA from before it started. He knows the command.”

Sources also indicated one of Clark’s goals has been to help clarify what the JCWA is in both vision and practical terms. Additionally Lt. Gen. Timothy Haugh who recently assumed the Cybercom deputy commander role from 16th Air Force — the Air Force’s information warfare command and service component to Cybercom — will turn his priority to the JCWA.

Haugh’s background recently as a commander in the fight and previously leading the elite cyber national mission force for Cybercom along with Clark’s vision will “bring in a renewed energy and perspective to what the command can do to synchronize JCWA within the headquarters” the source believes.

Some are already starting to see a change in both clarity and consolidation.

“It is positive that U.S. Cybercom is making some deliberate actions to centralize their efforts their resourcing and their control over the development of the JWCA and its elements in a way to address the complexity and the challenges they have had so far” Haas said. “The cyber domain is an extremely dynamic domain. It is a domain where we are in contact with our adversary every day. It is moving at a pace oftentimes it is more rapidly developing and evolving than the other physical domains. I think what you see in the evolution of the JCWA is a reflection of that reality.”

If the JCWA is to be a warfighting platform it also has to be outcomes focused meaning Cybercom has to focus on more than just the technical requirements when communicating to industry sources say.

“It is operational integration of the elements of the JCWA with a focus on achieving outcomes not just achieving an architecture. That is the way we design a platform. That’s the way we design any large complex warfighting platform be it a bomber a fighter aircraft carrier etc.” Haas said. “It’s got to be integration focused on operational outcomes. It has to move beyond the technical.”

Improved coordination with contractors

Cybercom is still a relatively new organization as far as DOD goes especially when it comes to building its own acquisition prowess that is poised to manage $3 billion.

Industry sources indicated that the command’s communication on priorities and needs is getting better from where it was years ago but there is still room for more improvement.

“The interaction with industry over the past couple of years has been challenging but I’m very encouraged by the recent deliberate engagements with industry” Haas said.

The command is hosting industry days where members of the contracting community can interact with procurement officials and hear what the command desires for support.

A Cybercom spokesperson noted the command holds various forums such as procurement forums and academic engagement network efforts through its DreamPort facility.

“At the top level [the command] and its partners have done a good job of articulating JCWA vision. From our company’s business we see well-articulated requirements and use cases at a contract level” Fogarty said.

These types of engagements have provided for more of a dialogue allowing industry to provide feedback to Cybercom.

“I think we’ve started to get back to a different state where they opened the doors slowly into that engagement and giving us those opportunities to have a two-way conversation” Benney said. “That type of level of engagement with industry and even some of our leaders that are involved in so many different elements of this gave us an opportunity to provide them real and honest feedback with where they’re going what they’re doing and where we think and giving them suggestions on where they need to go.”

The Cybercom spokesperson said as emerging and innovative capabilities are identified the command ensures associated requirements and needs are incorporated into the JCWA integration efforts.

Others indicated some of the most important dialogues occur in classified spaces indicating they’d like to see more of these.

“When we could have the classified discussions and really understand the threat and really understand what … they need from us I think those are critical” Gallagher said. “The threat-based understanding of what the demands are I think from Cybercom is helpful to all of industry.”

Others have suggested more unclassified sessions to attract more participation especially since many tools that underpin the technologies for the JCWA components are unclassified.

Fogarty said the most important relationship is threefold: the government acquisition element purchasing a capability industry and operators who will use the technology.

“We have seen success when all three parties are in close collaboration the feedback loop between operator and technology developer allows for the right capabilities to be developed and delivered in the right form factor for operational use. Ensuring this collaboration continues to the greatest extent possible will go a long way in ensuring the operational utility of the JCWA over time” he said.

Ultimately the biggest area the command needs to improve upon is integration to ensure success sources say.

“Given that they are moving in the right direction on some of the consolidation as we’ve discussed in viewing this as a platform I think that the biggest room for improvement lies … in that integration piece” Haas said reiterating it’s “not technically integrate because technical integration is necessary but insufficient to achieving operational outcomes.”",,,,,,

The morning event was held under a bustling tent located on the vast construction site. In his remarks Frenk recognized the many whose vision expertise and effort had led to the milestone day and the construction launch for “what will be the crown jewel for the University and in the community.”

“Envisioning and then building a medical facility of this magnitude doesn’t happen by chance” Frenk said. “It comes from a commitment to being a preeminent academic health system and from the people here today that are committed to excellence and improving access to health care.’’

When completed UHealth at SoLé Mia will become UHealth’s largest ambulatory site and will provide top-notch medical care to patients in North Miami-Dade and South Broward counties. Construction of the 7-story 363000-square-foot medical center is projected for completion in 2025.

Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava was among the dignitaries who celebrated the project and its community-based design. Levine Cava noted that her previous professional experience made her “profoundly aware of the critical need for quality health care and for that care to be accessible to all.”

“This visionary space this gem in the making demonstrates a commitment to a community that is all about healthy lifestyle and one now anchored by a world-class health institution” the mayor said.

In his remarks North Miami Mayor Phillipe Bien-Aimé remembered the groundbreaking ceremony 10 years ago for SoLé Mia the 184-acre mixed-use development in North Miami developed by the Soffer and LeFrak families.

Bien-Aimé said the city has long hoped for a first-class medical center to serve its residents and that the ceremony a decade ago gave him hope that it would happen.

“Today we are thrilled and excited that now we have it—first class best in class access to medical services—that our residents will have within 10 minutes of the homes” the mayor said. “This elevates everything around us.”

Richard LeFrak CEO of LeFrak said the day was especially satisfying for him and his family and discussed the proposed economic impact.

“It is easy to plan a large-scale community such as SoLé Mia on paper but then seeing that vision actually materialize into a place that people call home and enjoy being is personally hugely rewarding” LeFrak said. “At completion over 15000 people will live or work here.”

A number of facets of the master plan have already been completed he noted including the first 800 residential units. The opening of the medical center will coincide with the completion of a 30-story residential tower.

“When UHealth’s medical center is complete over $1.2B will have been invested in infrastructure and development at SoLé Mia creating thousands of jobs along the way” LeFrak said.

Both mayors also cited the investment jobs and economic activity that the construction will generate for the area.

Dr. Dipen J. Parekh chief operating officer of UHealth invited Dr. Henri R. Ford dean and chief academic officer of the Miller School of Medicine to join him at the podium.

Parekh described the new facility as a health care destination focused on healing wellness and prevention and detailed the wide range of high-quality care and treatments the new facility will provide that include specialists from the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center the only cancer center in South Florida to earn designation from the National Cancer Institute;; Bascom Palmer Eye Institute the top-ranked eye hospital in the country; and the Desai Sethi Urology Institute; as well as physicians from UHealth’s nationally ranked neurology and neurosurgery programs.

“UHealth at SoLé Mia will set the standard for top-flight health care in this community and patients will have access to specialties that are at the vanguard of medicine” Parekh said.

The medical establishment will be modeled after UHealth’s award-winning Lennar Foundation Medical Center located on the University of Miami Coral Gables Campus. Since it opened in December 2016 the Lennar center has been heralded as an innovative clinic for its ability to bring a positive patient experience by providing specialized care and treatment in a warm and inviting environment.

University of Miami Board of Trustees members who attended the ceremony included board chair Laurie Silvers; Manny Kadre vice chair; and trustees Richard Fain George Feldenkreis and H.T. Smith all of whom were recognized for having been actively involved in the planning and envisioning for the state-of-the-art facility.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9zb3V0aGZsb3JpZGEvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA5LzA5L3VoZWFsdGgtc29sZS1taWEtY2VudGVyLWJyZWFrcy1ncm91bmQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,University of Miami breaks ground on 363000-square-foot health care center - South Florida Business Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/southflorida/news/2022/09/09/uhealth-sole-mia-center-breaks-ground.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9zb3V0aGZsb3JpZGEvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA5LzA5L3VoZWFsdGgtc29sZS1taWEtY2VudGVyLWJyZWFrcy1ncm91bmQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9zb3V0aGZsb3JpZGEvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA5LzA5L3dhdGVyZnJvbnQtaG9tZS1sb3QtaW4tY29yYWwtZ2FibGVzLXNvbGQtZm9yLTE2bS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Waterfront home lot in Coral Gables sells for $16M - South Florida Business Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/southflorida/news/2022/09/09/waterfront-home-lot-in-coral-gables-sold-for-16m.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9zb3V0aGZsb3JpZGEvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA5LzA5L3dhdGVyZnJvbnQtaG9tZS1sb3QtaW4tY29yYWwtZ2FibGVzLXNvbGQtZm9yLTE2bS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

His name was on your ticket stub as the more hands-on half of DiCesare-Engler Productions that era's dominant concert bookers regionally bringing to town most of the big acts.

His title might have been ""promoter"" though Engler says a more fitting one might have been ""gambler"" as he explains in ""Behind The Stage Door"" a documentary about his trailblazing career debuting Sept. 13 on DIRECTV Apple TV iTunes Verizon FIOS and Frontier Communications. The movie makes its cinematic debut on Oct. 1 and again on Oct.. 15 at 5:30 p.m. in surround sound at The Rangos Giant Cinema at Carnegie Science Center.

The film outlines Engler's life wheeling and dealing with A-list artists like The Rolling Stones Bruce Springsteen and Paul McCartney.

Engler gets emotional recalling how a noticeably weakened Bob Marley insisted on performing a Stanley Theatre show because his bandmates ""needed the money."" That Marley concert Sept. 23 1980 at what's now the Benedum Center would be the final performance by Marley who died less than eight months later from cancer.

""Behind the Stage Door"" relies on interviews with music industry insiders like James Taylor's manager Peter Asher Kiss' manager Doc McGhee rockers Phil Ehart (Kansas) Lou Gramm (Foreigner) James Young (Styx) Danny Seraphine (Chicago) and Alex Lifeson guitarist for Rush who says ""The relationship between a promoter and an artist is seldom a very close personal relationship"" noting Engler was an exception.

""We were well taken care of and respected"" Lifeson said.

Gramm recalled Engler sitting in Pittsburgh radio station lobbies at 6 a.m. accompanying Foreigner on interviews hyping their local show.

""That endeared him to us even more"" he said.

Engler recalls his blue-collar dad's reaction when first hearing his boy hoped to become a concert promoter: ""I hate to tell you son that's not a career that's a hobby.""

One band manager says Engler and some other 1970s promoters acted like ""godfathers"" reigning over their turf though they built the successful infrastructure for what became a billion-dollar concert industry.

Engler helped rewrite the rulebook as a promoter who also printed the concert tickets.

Though even successful gamblers and godfathers experience losses.

""You're throwing $3 million down on the table in a bet that an attraction is going to at least break even"" Engler said. ""Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't.""

Exhibit A: The 1988 Monsters of Rock show at Three Rivers Stadium with Van Halen Metallica The Scorpions Dokken and Kingdom Come.

""I needed 40000 people to break even did 30-some thousand people (and) lost $400000 in one afternoon"" Engler said. ""That's brutal.""

DiCesare-Engler made an absolute fortune in 1998 when it sold off its assets to Clear Channel the conglomerate that became Live Nation the industry's primary concert promoters and owners of venues like The Pavilion at Star Lake.

That transition hasn't necessarily benefitted concertgoers the documentary claims.

""When big business takes over everything changes"" Engler said. ""The music business really started to fall apart. Guess who gets hurt? The customer. Ticket prices just keep going up up up and up. Little did I know you sell your heart and soul and everything.""

Billy Price's 50 years of soul

Love lust longing lament − Billy Price dives into all the crucial emotions with that smooth and oh-so-soulful voice of his on a new three-CD set: ""Billy Price: 50+ Years of Soul.""

Pittsburgh's beloved blue-eyed soul/R&B singer curated the remixed collection spanning evenly through his half-century career. He includes songs from his early 1970s days as vocalist with nationally known guitar virtuoso Roy Buchanan onward to fronting The Keystone Rhythm Band and Billy Price Band.

Price's liner notes give ample credit to the former Jeree Recording in New Brighton where the first Price & The Keystone Rhythm Band album ""Is It Over?"" was recorded in 1978-79.

""New Brighton was an unlikely locale for a recording studio"" Price says ""but at the Jeree board was a kindred spirit named Don Garvin. Don a great guitar player who played for many years with the Pure Gold oldies group was a soul-blues aficionado just like me. We clicked from the moment we met and Don would go on to engineer and play guitar on three albums for me at Jeree (""Danger Zone"" and ""The Soul Collection"" were others).

The 16-page insert also discusses notable KRB and Billy Price Band alums like Eric Leeds who later joined music legend Prince's band; the late Glenn Pavone whom Price recalls as a guitarist as talented as any national guitar god and Eric DeFade the two-time Grammy Award-winning saxophonist and Lincoln Park Performing Arts Center adjunct professor whom Price salutes on-stage amid a couple Disc 1 live selections.

The CDs also include cuts from Price's collaborations with his R&B/soul music hero Otis Clay and blues guitarist Fred Chapellier who has helped Price expand his French fan base.

Available at billyprice.com ""Billy Price: 50+ Years of Soul"" is one of those mood-lifting albums you play straight through savoring that way Price vocally testifies about the almighty power of love. Album cuts like ""I Know It's Your Party (I Just Came Here to Dance)"" ""Lifestyles of The Poor and Unknown"" ""It Ain't a Juke Joint Without The Blues"" and ""Let's Get Married"" will put pep in your step.

To hear him live get to the official CD release show Oct. 1 at the Syria Shrine Center in Cheswick.

WYEP weekend shuffle

Pittsburgh's 91.3 WYEP altered its weekend programming eliminating a few specialty shows to give listeners more of the indie rock Americana blues and local hip-hop the station plays on weekdays.

Among the changes ""An American Sampler"" leaves the Sunday evening schedule. Host Ken Batista has been among the station’s longest-tenured volunteer hosts bringing folk and acoustic music to listeners for 31 years.

""The Soul Show"" a tradition since 1995 also departs from its Saturday afternoon slot. Smooth-voiced host Mike Canton will continue the show on his website soulshowmike.org.

Unchanged are the Saturday evening blues shows Big Town Blues and Rollin' & Tumblin'.

Catch ""The Grateful Dead Hour"" 11 p.m. Sundays.

Beside Tyler in black hat black jacket and just as many sparkles Joe Perry ripped into a tough and sweet riff he wrote in 1976.

Tyler is 74. Perry turns 72 on Sept. 10.

Apparently nothing can kill them or their band — not age drugs infighting prolonged hiatuses pandemics falling down on stage falling off the stage or the death of the record industry. Following inconceivable comeback after inconceivable comeback Aerosmith have achieved immortality. Or at least that’s how it felt in a packed Fenway Park on Thursday. Packed as in over 38700 people. According to Live Nation it was the most concert tickets ever sold for a show in the venue.

Because of those endless inconceivable comebacks the Aerosmith catalog runs from the ’70s sleaze of “Mama Kin” to the ’80s sheen of “Love in an Elevator” to the ’90s syrup of “I Don’t Want to Miss a Thing.” The band indulged in every era without blinking (thankfully leaning into the sleaze).

From “Back in the Saddle” the Bad Boys of Boston (and they had the energy of kids Thursday) waded into the raunch with impish glee: “Same Old Song and Dance” into “Rag Doll” into “Mama Kin” into fabulous garage rock sludge of Shangri-Las cover “Remember (Walking in the Sand).” I’ve seen righteously dirty and downright ugly Aerosmith sets this one was righteously filthy.

Tyler’s body has recovered from recent surgery his voice better than it has been in years maybe decades. Perry occasionally plays too loose at the ballpark he made every riff taught bright and bold and laid down a half dozen solos in the sweet spot between economical and unhinged.

Longtime secret weapons bassist Tom Hamilton and second guitarist Brad Whitford gave backbone to every pop turn rock shuffle and power ballad — Perry and Whitford’s guitar duel on “Elevator” showed off 50 years of chemistry. (The band’s longtime drum technician the didn’t-miss-a-beat John Douglas filled in for Joey Kramer who is on a “temporary leave of absence.”)

The shiny stuff which tends to come from the late ’80s and early ’90s had the band trying to match the fury of the opening 30 minutes. “Cryin’” deserved to be a radio and MTV staple but the Fenway version couldn’t compete with the rough stuff; “I Don’t Want to Miss a Thing” is better than you remember and worse than anything else in the set.

But it seemed the five couldn’t wait to get back to the ’70s rocks gems and big ones. Kudos to Aerosmith for spotlighting minor masterpiece “Seasons of Wither.” Congratulations for once again pulling off the epic stunt of having Tyler belt out “Dream On” behind a white grand piano atop the Green Monster. Cheers for slamming “Sweet Emotion” and “Walk This Way” back to back in a closing reminder that Aerosmith’s immortality is based as much on its classic catalog as its stage show.

Now that we know Aerosmith will be around forever can Fenway book them for 2023 and 2024 and …

Thanks Aerosmith for picking fellow hometown heroes Extreme as the support act. In the ’80s the band was tighter than its peers. Now Extreme may be the only hard rock act of that era that hasn’t lost a step. Singer Gary Cherone has the pipes moves physique charisma and bravado of a 20-year-old. Guitarist Nuno Bettencourt is the only shredder who can play in the pocket and write memorable riffs. Bonus points for a set that was equal parts tender ballads funk and neo-classical speed metal.

Technology reduced data transfer time for military helicopters by more than 80%

Using 5G capabilities network engineers transfer health and usage data from a Sikorsky UH-60M Black Hawk to Waterton Colorado for real-time analysis

Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) and AT&T* securely and rapidly transferred UH-60M Black Hawk health and usage data through an AT&T 5G private cellular network and Lockheed Martin’s 5G.MIL® multi-site pilot network in a test conducted Aug. 4 at Lockheed Martin’s Sikorsky headquarters in Stratford Connecticut. The test demonstrated that wireless 5G technologies on the flight line can support accelerated maintenance operations and improved aircraft readiness to support our service members. It also proved highly secure interoperability between the AT&T millimeter wave 5G private cellular network and the 5G.MIL pilot network.

“These 5G capabilities deployed at scale are expected to enable high-speed secure-data transfer on virtually any flight line providing another example of how we’re advancing our 21st Century Security vision by improving customer readiness and operations” said Dan Rice vice president of 5G.MIL Programs at Lockheed Martin. “In collaboration with commercial 5G leaders an interoperable 5G.MIL multi-site multi-vendor network is another step closer to reality.”

The AT&T 5G millimeter wave private cellular network wirelessly transferred data to the 5G.MIL network through ground support equipment from the Black Hawk’s Integrated Vehicle Health Management System (IVHMS). The data was then routed to local Sikorsky networks for processing and distribution through the secure Lockheed Martin 5G.MIL pilot network to the Waterton Colorado 5G test range site.

Currently it takes Black Hawk crews about 30 minutes to remove the IVHMS data cartridge from the helicopter transport it to an operations center and extract the data for analysis. Lockheed Martin used AT&T 5G private cellular technologies to reduce the time required to less than 5 minutes including cartridge removal demonstrating the potential benefits in time and cost for military and commercial helicopter operations.

The IVHMS provides monitoring and diagnostic capabilities to ensure a more reliable aircraft. It monitors captures and evaluates detailed aircraft-generated data as a result of flight maneuvers. It also captures aircraft limit exceedances on airframe and dynamic components and monitors temperature and vibration of key components on the aircraft. It does this through hundreds of on-board sensors that report the status of the aircraft by monitoring the airframe engines and other dynamic components. Operators assess these thousands of data points to ensure the aircraft is safe reliable and ready to fly.

“Timely and secure transfer and analysis of mission and operations data are critical to military readiness and effectiveness” said Lance Spencer client executive vice president Defense AT&T Public Sector and FirstNet. “This is one of many areas of commercial 5G innovation we are exploring to support defense commercial aviation and related fields where our 5G-related services can modernize legacy processes and help deliver truly transformational benefits.”

Lockheed Martin and AT&T also are working with other leading companies in networking and defense to modernize and transform communications capabilities for defense purposes. Future demonstrations are expected to further enhance 5G wireless technology communications solutions for flight lines aiming to continually shorten aircraft turnaround times to reduce costs and improve military operational readiness. These capabilities deployed at scale can support high-speed secure-data transfer on both commercial and military flight lines.

AT&T’s 5G and private cellular Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) capabilities are deployed together by multiple industrial customers in factories nationwide where they enable ultra-fast highly secure wireless processing and information transfer.

The F-35 joint program office paused F-35 deliveries on Aug. 31 after Honeywell — which makes the F-35’s turbomachine which helps provide the power needed to start the engine — disclosed that a supplier for the turbomachine’s lube pumps had used Chinese alloys in magnets. If a Defense Contracts Management Agency investigation finds that use of the alloy violates defense acquisition regulations the top Pentagon acquisition official would be required to issue a waiver stating that resuming production is in the best interest of US national security.

Bill LaPlante the undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment suggested he would do just that during a Friday briefing at the Pentagon.

“They’re moving pretty quickly” LaPlante said of the investigation. If DCMA finds that the Chinese alloy does not cause any impact on air worthiness or the security of the airplane “we’ll be able to do a waiver and … get the production line moving again. So I’m hoping is going to be resolved pretty soon.”

Both the F-35 joint program office and F-35 prime contractor Lockheed Martin have said that the magnet does not present a risk to flight safety nor does it provide a security risk that could be exploited by China to glean information about the F-35’s stealth capabilities.

Honeywell has stopped working with the supplier of the Chinese alloy and has found an alternate US-based source that will be delivered next month Lockheed spokeswoman Laura Siebert said in a statement. However it is unclear when F-35s made with the new alloy would begin rolling off the production line.

LaPlante said the F-35 production problem is indicative of a larger issue among defense contractors called supply chain illumination or the ability for a prime contractor to have insight into all of the parts that make up a large complicated platform and where those materials are sourced.

“What this is becoming — and it’s been recognized for some time — is almost a real-time issue of tracking and making sure that there’s integrity in your supply chain” he said. “The good news is that there are tools coming out using artificial intelligence and open source [software] that can dive in and maybe find some of these things. But I think it’s going to be a constant a constant issue for us is understanding our supply chain.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqQFodHRwczovL25hdnlyZWNvZ25pdGlvbi5jb20vaW5kZXgucGhwL25hdmFsLW5ld3MvbmF2YWwtbmV3cy1hcmNoaXZlLzIwMjIvc2VwdGVtYmVyLzEyMTczLWxvY2toZWVkLW1hcnRpbi1hd2FyZGVkLXVzZDU0bS1mb3ItaXNpcy1pbnRlZ3JhdGVkLXN1Ym1hcmluZS1pbWFnaW5nLXN5c3RlbS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lockheed Martin awarded USD54M for ISIS Integrated Submarine Imaging System,"The U.S. Department of Defense on September 8 announced that Lockheed Martin Rotary and Mission Systems Manassas Virginia is awarded a $54009718 cost-plus-incentive-fee modification to a previously awarded contract to exercise options for engineering services and other direct costs in support of the Integrated Submarine Imaging System (ISIS).

Lockheed needed “to build the impossible—and do it fast.”

Development work on an aircraft to improve the United States’ intelligence-gathering capabilities had already begun at Lockheed’s Skunk Works in Burbank California.

During President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s second term tensions between the U.S. and the USSR escalated significantly. When Gary Powers’ U-2 aircraft was hit by Soviet surface-to-air missiles and he was forced to bail out and then was captured the Cold War became even hotter.

After the inauguration of President John F. Kennedy on January 20 1961 relations between the two nations deteriorated even more—due to incidents like the Bay of Pigs the loss of another U-2 over Cuba the erection of the Berlin Wall and the Cuban Missile Crisis. An improved spy plane was desperately needed.

Delivering ‘Impossible’ Technologies

Considered one of the best aircraft designers of the 20th century Clarence “Kelly” Johnson led Lockheed’s Skunk Works team that had previously delivered “impossible” technologies on “incredibly short strategically critical deadlines” (including the U-2).

However this new aircraft was radically different. “Everything had to be invented” Johnson recalled. Nonetheless he committed the Skunk Works team to create such an aircraft—and to have a prototype flying in “a mere 20 months.”

The new airplane’s speed was mandated to exceed 2000 mph—1740 knots—and not for short after-burner-driven bursts but to maintain that speed for hours. However at that speed atmospheric friction generates temperatures that could melt a conventional airframe of the time.

Dealing with the issue of extreme heat there were numerous design and material challenges. Designers decided that only a titanium alloy would provide the strength needed be lighter than stainless steel and be durable enough to withstand excessive temperatures and speed.

The titanium alloy was covered with a corrugated skin that was heat-resistant. The concept of a “stealth aircraft” was new while the use of titanium was also an almost unexplored area of engineering. Because titanium is a very sensitive material new tools and processes had to be developed.

In regard to heat while the airplane’s leading edges would be subjected to high temperatures the ambient temperature that the aircraft would be flying through was minus-60 degrees Fahrenheit.

The team’s engineer Ben Rich grappled with this for long hours before he remembered that black paint both emits and absorbs heat. To help redirect the heat caused by friction the aircraft was painted black which led to its name: “Blackbird.”

First Flights and Modifications

Lockheed designated the Blackbird prototype the A-12. Its first flight occurred on April 30 1962. The A-12 was a single-seat aircraft; in total 13 A-12s were produced and they were used in a top-secret CIA program. As FLYING contributing author Peter Garrison noted in his column Technicalities (FLYING October 1994) “Lockheed delivered an airplane…that could cruise at almost 2000 knots 15 miles above the ground and had an unrefueled range of 2300 nm. At that time such performance was unheard of. But the technology for it existed or lay just within reach; this was remember the era of the X-15 and the XB-70 as well.”

The new aircraft would inevitably draw comparison to the X-15 powered by a single Reaction Motors XLR99 57000-pound thrust liquid propellant rocket engine and famously taken to a record-shattering speed of Mach 6.7 by Air Force Capt. William “Pete” Knight during an Oct. 3 1967 flight that reached an altitude of 102100 feet.

Another A-12 variant was designed as an interceptor. Air-to-air missiles and another cockpit were added for a second crew member to operate radar equipment. This was the YF-12 and it looked identical to the A-12 except for its nose. Three YF-12s were constructed and operated by the U.S. Air Force. A third variant was the M-21 which had a pylon on its back for mounting and launching one of the first unmanned drones. Two M-21s were built; however the program was stopped in 1966 after a drone collided with its mothership killing one of the pilots.

The SR-71 Is Born

The final derivative of the A-12 had a twin cockpit and larger fuel capacity. Flight tests on the improved prototype continued and the airplane broke height and speed records. On July 20 1963 it achieved a sustained speed above Mach 3 at an altitude of 78000 feet.

Called the SR-71—SR for Strategic Reconnaissance—it first flew on December 22 1964 piloted by Robert “Bob” Gilliland a Lockheed test pilot. According to the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force the first SR-71 entered service in January 1966 at Beale Air Force Base (KBAB) in California. This version would fly intelligence missions for the U.S. Air Force for more than 30 years. A total of 32 SR-71s were built according to the National Air & Space Museum. Including all the variants there were a total of 50 Blackbirds built.

A key modification of the SR-71 was a reduction of its radar image. Although the initial test flight had gone well there were rumors of new advances in radar by the Soviets so the U.S. government requested the radar profile be reduced.

To comply the Skunk Works team redesigned the aircraft’s surfaces to avoid reflecting radar signals moved the engines to mid-wing and added radar-absorbing elements to the aircraft’s special paint.

The improvements were radar-tested using a full-scale model of the Blackbird. The results were definitive; although the Blackbird was more than 100 feet long it “would appear on Soviet radar as bigger than a bird but smaller than a man” according to Lockheed. Skunk Works staff “had succeeded in reducing” the Blackbird’s “radar cross-section by 90 percent!”

As described by the Smithsonian Institution “the Lockheed SR-71 was a twin-engine two-seat supersonic strategic reconnaissance aircraft. Its airframe was constructed largely of titanium and its alloys; while its vertical tail fins were constructed of a composite to reduce the aircraft’s radar cross-section. It was equipped with Pratt & Whitney J58 turbojet engines that featured large inlet shock cones.”

The engines were as complex as the rest of the aircraft. At the time the J58 engines were the only engines built to continuously use afterburners (which is why the SR-71 consumed so much fuel). When the airplane was flying at supersonic speed each engine inlet was “blocked” by a spike which moved forward and backward depending on the airplane’s speed.

The SR-71 in Operation

Interestingly no Blackbirds ever flew over Soviet airspace because the U.S. stopped Soviet overflights after the 1960 U-2 incident. However SR-71s were used over Eastern Europe the Middle East Vietnam North Korea and locations that have yet to be declassified.

No Blackbird was ever lost to enemy fire. However the airplanes’ reliability was an issue; 12 of 32 were lost to accidents. In addition it was very complicated to operate and fly. According to aviation historian Peter Merlin a great deal of effort was required to get an SR-71 into the air. “It took an army of people to prepare the aircraft. A Blackbird operational mission essentially had a countdown like a space mission because there was so much preparation involved in both getting the crew ready and the vehicle ready—an unbelievable amount of effort and manpower.”

Piloting the Blackbird

Piloting the Blackbird was a very difficult assignment that took total concentration. However its pilots welcomed the challenges. According to the Lockheed Martin website Air Force Colonel Jim Wadkins said “At 85000 feet and Mach 3 it was almost a religious experience. Nothing had prepared me to fly that fast… My God even now I get goose bumps remembering.”

Because of the SR-71’s speed normal visual references such as highways rivers and metropolitan areas were replaced by larger objects—mountain ranges coastlines and large bodies of water.

Blackbirds were unaffected by air defense systems because of their incredible speed and high-altitude operational characteristics. While the SR-71 had electronic countermeasures its main defensive system against missiles was simply to outrun them. As quoted from a documentary about the SR-71 Blackbird on PBS “If a surface-to-air missile launch was detected the standard evasive action was simply to accelerate and outfly the missile.”

Lockheed’s Johnson announced in 1981 that more than 1000 missiles had been launched at the SR-71 but none of them had damaged one of the aircraft.

NASA’s SR-71 Program

The Air Force retired the remaining SR-71s in 1990 but NASA continued to use four Blackbirds through the 1990s and early 2000s. At the SR-71’s service ceiling of 85000 feet it was possible to see the curvature of the Earth; it was an excellent experimental unit for space travel. With its speed and height capabilities the aircraft was used as a platform to conduct research and experiments in aerodynamics propulsion structures thermal protection materials high-speed and high-temperature instrumentation atmospheric studies and sonic boom characterization.

NASA’s high-speed and high-altitude aeronautical research occurred at Dryden Flight Research Center which was located within the boundaries of Edwards Air Force Base. Dryden’s SR-71 activities involved other NASA research centers government agencies universities and commercial firms.

NASA’s SR-71 program was canceled in late 2001.

An Icon of the Cold War Era

The Air Force retired its fleet of SR-71s on January 26 1990 owing in part to defense budget cuts and the high costs of operation. As technology improved the SR-71 was replaced by satellites and UAVs which offered instant access to surveillance data.

The SR-71 first leapt into the skies in December 1964. Many consider it the most iconic aircraft of the Cold War era. On July 28 1976 a Blackbird set records that remain unbroken—flying at a sustained altitude of 85069 feet and a top speed of 2193.2 miles per hour or Mach 3.3.

Although most of us will never be privy to the critical information Blackbirds gathered they provided the United States with detailed mission-critical reconnaissance for more than two decades. The SR-71 was one of several spy airplanes built to venture into enemy territory without being shot down or even detected. From 80000 feet an SR-71 could survey 100000 square miles of Earth’s surface each hour.

Most of the remaining Blackbirds are stationed at museums or military bases across the U.S. On its retirement flight from Los Angeles to Washington D.C. on March 6 1990 (on the way to the Smithsonian National Air & Space Museum) a Blackbird flew coast to coast in a record-setting 1 hour 4 minutes and 20 seconds.

“It still looks like something from the future even though it was designed back in the 1950s” Merlin said. “Because of the way the fuselage bends and the wing curves and twists it looks more organic than mechanical. Most conventional airplanes look like someone built them—this one almost looks like it was grown.”

The companies announced this week that same-day delivery will be available from more than 1700 Lowe’s stories nationwide with 30000 items available in as little as an hour including bulkier items such as portable grills and firepits. Lowe’s says it’s one of the first retailers to take advantage of Instacart’s app-based service.

Home Depot which was one of the first announced retail customers of Walmart’s outsourced GoLocal delivery service last fall expanded it to multiple markets by the end of 2021. But it doesn’t allow for delivery of big and bulky items as Lowe’s does. The latter lets customers to order items up to up to 3x3x5 feet and 60 pounds that can come same day via the new Instacart service.

In March Walmart merged GoLocal with its Delivery Services platform which provides access to a network of last-mile carriers for merchants and offers tracking visibility and communication for end customers.

“Lowe’s knows how much this time of year means to our customers” said Mike Shady Lowe’s senior vice president of online in a release. “Whether they are rounding out their Halloween decorating or getting started on holiday prep and gifting we’re able to offer more products more convenience and more value for customers as we continue to improve the shopping experience in-store and online.”

In a related move Instacart last month rolled out a big-and-bulky delivery offering entering the sphere of last-mile providers like UPS’s Roadie and XPO Logistics. Some early customers of the service include Big Lots Container Store Mastermind Toys Office Depot Spirit Halloween and Staples. The company touts the ability for shoppers to order larger items like televisions alongside their typical grocery order.

Instacart’s expansion of its mainstay grocery delivery service make perfect sense given the falloff in the last year of e-grocery and symbiotic delivery services after a massive boom driven by the pandemic lockdowns.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vc3RvcmVicmFuZHMuY29tL2xvd2VzLWFuZC1pbnN0YWNhcnQtb2ZmZXItc2FtZS1kYXktZGVsaXZlcnnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lowe's and Instacart Offer Same-Day Delivery,"Home improvement retailer Lowe’s has partnered with Instacart to give customers better access to the retailer’s own brands.

Lowe’s shoppers can now enjoy same-day delivery on Instacart available at more than 1700 Lowe’s locations nationwide. Nearly 30000 items can be ordered for delivery in as fast as an hour including larger items up to 3x3x5 feet and 60 pounds.

""Lowe's knows how much this time of year means to our customers.

""We're excited to open up this new fulfillment offering across the U.S. for customers to shop for all of their project needs.""

Lowe's piloted same-day delivery via Instacart in select markets in February and the service is now available in all 50 states and Washington D.C. In addition to the expanded assortment of household home and garden and seasonal products Lowe's is one of the only retailers today that sells non-mixed paint on the Instacart App offering non-tinted paint and assorted paint supplies for customers.

“As the seasons change we know customers are thinking about how to get their homes ready for fall"" said Chris Rogers Chief Business Officer at Instacart. ""We're excited to offer Lowe's wide variety of home improvement essentials for delivery across the country so customers can get exactly what they need seamlessly.

Your extended warranty may not be what you expect","Chances are we've all been there.

You shell out money for expensive electronics then the cashier tries to sell you an extended warranty to protect your investment.

One San Antonio man found out the hard way how plans work might not always be what you expect them to.

Frustrated with his experience he reached out to Fox San Antonio's Problem Solver Darian trotter for help.

When this man we'll call ""Roger"" first bought his LG washer and dryer he felt good about his purchase.

""Oh yes I was very pleased with it"" Roger said.

We are protecting the identity of this Fox San Antonio employee who says he shelled out more than $2000 at Lowe's and even sprung a couple hundred dollars more on the 3-year Protection Plan.

""I spent so much money on these I wanted them to last and if I had a problem with it I wanted the extended warranty to cover it"" Roger said.

It's a good thing he did. Two years later after the manufacturer's expired he had a problem with his washer.

The Lowe's Protection Plan covered the repair but that wasn't the end of his troubles.

Fast-forward one year later four years after the purchase date Roger had the same problem with the washer.

""Push start and the rest of the buttons wouldn't work"" said Roger.

Good thing he was covered. He had one year of the manufacturer's warranty and three more years from the Lowe's Protection Plan totaling four years or so he thought.

""Angry upset"" Roger said.

Roger was a full year out of warranty.

It turns out the Lowe's Protection Plan began at the time of purchase. In other words both coverage plans were active for the first year.

Roger asked ""Why would you need a year on top of the manufacturer's warranty?""

It sounds like a reasonable question for anyone buying electronics and one that apparently has Fox San Antonio viewers scratching their head.

We caught up with some of them outside of major electronics stores.

Reporter Darian Trotter asked ""When does the extra coverage begin? I believe it begins when you acquire the plan"" Ernest Fernandez replied.

Estevan Cortez replied ""Afterwards after the one year.""

Brenda Seams said ""I have no idea I have no idea.""

According to Lowe's the 3-year Protection Plan for appliances covers parts and labor if available for normal wear and tear.

The plan starts at purchase but the benefit starts after the manufacturer's limited warranty ends.

Trotter asked ""Little confusing? Little bit"" Fernandez replied. ""I would like it to be clearer.""

""Well it makes me feel I got cheated out of a year"" Roger said.

We reached out to Lowe's.

A member from the corporate office explains depending on the item the Protection Plan offers coverage the manufacturer's warranty does not; like Power Surge Coverage.

An online search reveals five additional coverages including $300 dollars for food lost to a faulty refrigerator or freezer.

""I feel like a lot of people out there don't know this and they need to know"" Roger said.

Roger turned to the Problem Solvers frustrated after he says Lowe's repeatedly denied repairing his broken washer.

After we got involved the electronics giant issued a statement saying ""The satisfaction of our customers is our top priority and Lowe's has been working with ""the customer"" to address his concerns.""

We were eventually able to get Lowe's to make the repairs and at no cost.

As for the need for extended warranties national consumer expert Clark Howard doesn't buy them.

He suggests saving your money for an unlikely repair.

Lowe's has been revamping its business model.

This isn't the first change that Lowe's has made in 2022. Earlier this summer the company unveiled plans to move into the metaverse with its new virtual reality platform Lowe's Open Builder. Through the platform shoppers can access and download 500 metaverse product ""assets""—like home décor and furniture—for free. Open Builder helps you get a sense of what your home improvement project will look like before making any big commitments or investments. The assets are 3D and you can design and experiment with different décor items like rugs patio sets and other accents.ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb

In February Lowe's also announced a partnership with the delivery service Instacart allowing customers to shop for over 20000 products online and have them delivered the same day. Now the retailer is expanding this offering helping shoppers nationwide save more time.

You'll have access to a new delivery option.

If you're familiar with Instacart you probably think of groceries which is what the app is best known for. But thanks to its partnership with Lowe's Instacart also delivers home improvement supplies meaning you can get same-day delivery for nuts and bolts or even festive fall decorations.

The partnership was piloted at select Lowe's locations in Charlotte North Carolina and Boston Massachusetts in the winter. But as of Sept. 8 same-day delivery is now available at over 1700 Lowe's stores across the U.S. the company announced in a press release. According to ScrapeHero the home improvement chain operates a total of 1728 locations in 1258 cities.

""As the seasons change we know customers are thinking about how to get their homes ready for fall"" Chris Rogers chief business officer at Instacart said in the press release. ""We're excited to offer Lowe's wide variety of home improvement essentials for delivery across the country so customers can get exactly what they need seamlessly.

There's even more items available.

Back in February when Instacart and Lowe's first started working together 20000 items were available for shoppers. According to the latest press release the retailer has since upped this number to include a whopping 30000 items.

The service is available in all 50 states as well as Washington D.C. and Lowe's shoppers will be some of the first to have same-day and scheduled delivery of larger items via Instacart. According to the press release to be delivered items can't be bigger than three feet by three feet by five feet or over 60 pounds. Still a wide variety of products fit that criteria and Lowe's notes that it's ""one of the only retailers today that sells non-mixed paint on the Instacart App offering non-tinted paint and assorted paint supplies for customers.""

Lowe's took timing into consideration.

According to the press release the expansion of Instacart services at Lowe's is timed ahead of the hectic holiday season. If you want to avoid that hustle and bustle you have all the more reason to take advantage of this new feature.

""Lowe's knows how much this time of year means to our customers. Whether they are rounding out their Halloween decorating or getting started on holiday prep and gifting we're able to offer more products more convenience and more value for customers as we continue to improve the shopping experience in-store and online"" Mike Shady Lowe's senior vice president of online said in the press release.

It's pretty simple to get started as well. Visit the site and click the ""Start Shopping"" option. This will take you to Lowe's Instacart page where you can input your delivery information and address to find the store nearest to you.

Once you've picked out all of your items you select a ""delivery timeframe"" for when your Instacart shopper will pick up and deliver the items—which can be as quick as an hour. Just like when you use Instacart with other stores you can chat with your shopper and track them as they make their way to you.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNici5jb20vc29kYXBvcC1zYWRkZXN0LWFyYy12aWV0bmFtLXdhci1kZWF0aC10aGUtb3V0c2lkZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Outsider: Why Rob Lowe's Sodapop Had the Saddest Story,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNici5jb20vc29kYXBvcC1zYWRkZXN0LWFyYy12aWV0bmFtLXdhci1kZWF0aC10aGUtb3V0c2lkZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"
LULU,Lululemon Athletica,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy8zLXJlYXNvbnMtd2h5LWx1bHVsZW1vbi1sdWx1LTE2NDUwNDIxMS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Reasons Why Lululemon (LULU) Is a Great Growth Stock,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.

That's because these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.

However it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.

Lululemon (LULU) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score but also carries a top Zacks Rank.

Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) returns are even better.

Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this athletic apparel maker a great growth pick right now.

Earnings Growth

Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.

While the historical EPS growth rate for Lululemon is 28% investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 25.9% this year crushing the industry average which calls for EPS growth of 1.6%.

Cash Flow Growth

Cash is the lifeblood of any business but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.

Right now year-over-year cash flow growth for Lululemon is 54.7% which is higher than many of its peers. In fact the rate compares to the industry average of 48.3%.

While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 26.6% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 8.8%.

Story continues

Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions

Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Lululemon. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 4.6% over the past month.

Bottom Line

Lululemon has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors including the ones discussed above but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.

You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

This combination positions Lululemon well for outperformance so growth investors may want to bet on it.

“A gal was doing ice cream pop-ups in New York City and there was a bourbon-based bar in Atlanta” said Boozy’s owner Dani Nickle.

Fast forward to 2022 and the landscape has completely changed. Alcohol-infused ice cream shops with names like Tipsy Cow and Buzzed Bull are popping up all around San Antonio.

Nickle views these other ice cream shops not as competition but as opportunities to drive more business to Boozy’s. If people like what they get at those other shops she reasons they might be more likely to check out Boozy’s.

“I’m an arranger” says Boozy’s owner Dani Nickle. “I love having a lot of things going on.” Credit: Bria Woods / San Antonio Report

Sandwiched between the Sexology Institute and Oh Yeah Cakes at 711 S. St. Mary’s St. Boozy’s offers alcoholic ice cream and a handful of cocktails served over ice or ice cream. For the underage and teetotaling crowd Boozy’s always has a couple non-alcoholic flavors.

The menu is seasonal and constantly changing; new flavors and drinks are shared via Facebook and Instagram. Citing trade secrets Nickle won’t reveal how much alcohol is in each scoop of her ice cream.

Nickle’s journey to opening Boozy’s started with a ten-year plan she made while working for yoga-wear retailer Lululemon — she was part of the team that opened the Lululemon location at the Quarry.

“If I can say anything about [Lululemon] it’s that they have a commitment to educating their employees on all aspects of business” she said — an education so thorough Nickle said it prepared her to be a business owner.

“I have friends who have MBAs and they have told me I came out of Lulu with more business experience than they did” she said.

Nickle echoes many entrepreneurs when describing why she wanted to own her own business: being her own boss she said would allow her to “manage my life and my work and be happy in what I’m doing.”

She struggled at first though to land on the right business idea.

Initially her plan was to open a bakery selling unique cupcakes she created herself. Then for a while Nickle was set on opening a New Orleans style daiquiri bar. She got far enough along with that idea to actually purchase several daiquiri machines before learning that the City of San Antonio did not allow establishments to sell daiquiris to-go unless they were agave-based (this was before the pandemic prompted a new state law in 2021 that allows alcohol to be sold to go).

She tried creating an ice cream/daiquiri mix that would skirt the to-go law at the time sharing her efforts with friends and members of the Crossfit gym where she coaches. The feedback? Drop the daiquiri and focus on the delicious boozy ice cream creations.

Nickle sold her daiquiri machines and Boozy’s was born. The shop opened its doors almost ten years to the day of Nickle’s original ten-year plan.

Like many business owners Nickle had to be nimble to survive during the pandemic. She would order just enough ingredients for pre-orders selling them out the front door of her shop. Having a frozen product that wouldn’t spoil was also helpful she said.

In the beginning Nickle’s parents made the ice cream a huge help as the new entrepreneur juggled all her responsibilities which included the birth of her first son.

“We had a basic recipe and would alter it accordingly” said Nickle. “When I took over I shadowed my mom for about six months to write recipes and directions down. I had to pull recipe cards out for [another] six months before I felt confident in just making ice cream. Now I just go with it the way my mom did.”

She credits her parents and her friends with giving her the support she needs to run a business home school her two boys and coach Crossfit classes.

“I literally have a village around me” she said. “But also one of my strengths is I’m an arranger. I love having a lot of things going on.”

As an arranger Nickle adds her personal touch to every aspect of the business. From the unique ice cream flavors she dreams up herself like Coffee Chaos Limoncello and Not Your Mama’s Peanut Butter and Jelly to the “No we don’t serve vanilla” sign outside the store.

She can be found working behind the counter most nights — the shop is currently open Wednesdays through Sundays afternoon and evenings — along with her rotating crew of seven employees.

Boozy’s customer Jessica Maldonado Dushock loves Nickle’s ‘just go with it’ approach so much she and her family have become regulars.

Dushock a self-described foodie stumbled upon Boozy’s one pre-pandemic night when she and her family were looking for somewhere to have dessert. The positive Yelp reviews and central location initially drew them to Boozy’s but she said the tipsy ice cream and drinks are what keeps them coming back.

“We went there and we loved it” said Dushock. Boozy’s had a little something for everyone in the family. Jessica’s mom who is a big root beer float fan was able to get her root beer float fix with a float made with real beer while Jessica’s sister-in-law indulges in the rotating ice cream flavors with different shots.

“The King William” — cream cinnamon cream rum coffee vodka paired with ice cream — is Jessica’s favorite drink. She said it reminds her of drinking horchata as a child and she orders it every time.

While it’s normally a seasonal menu item Nickle keeps the ingredients available for whenever Dushock comes in. That customer-centric service Dushock said is what keeps her loyal to Boozy’s. She said she and her husband still go there almost every weekend.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy52YW5jb3V2ZXJpc2F3ZXNvbWUuY29tL2hpZ2hsaWdodHMvbWljcm9zb2Z0LWx1bHVsZW1vbi10YWtlLWxlYWQtc2Nvb3BpbmctdXAtZG93bnRvd24tdmFuY291dmVyLW9mZmljZS1zcGFjZS1pbi0yMDIyLTU4MDI3MzDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft Lululemon take lead scooping up downtown Vancouver office space in 2022,"Don’t expect the abundance of top-quality office space to last long in Vancouver’s downtown core.

Don’t expect the abundance of top-quality office space to last long in Vancouver’s downtown core.

Downtown office vacancy reached 8 per cent as of mid-year 2022 up one full percentage point compared with the first six months of 2021 according to a new report from Avison Young (Canada) Inc.

But the real estate firm notes this trend is unfolding “due to significant amounts of new supply” being delivered to the market.

Nearly 57000 square feet additional AAA space was made available by the end of 2021 and has been “steadily absorbed” into the market the report said.

Most notably this has come via the openings of such towers as the Deloitte Summit on West Hastings Street and Bentall 4 on the corner of Dunsmuir and Burrard Streets.

“While there are still elevated levels of vacancy relative to pre-pandemic levels the market is starting to stabilize” the report stated acknowledging that the hybrid model of work has reshaped demand for office space.

“Further increases in vacancy are likely but will be more attributable to delivery of new buildings on a vacant or largely vacant basis rather than COVID-19.”

The biggest acquirers so far this year appear to be tech giant Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq:MSFT) and Vancouver-based fashion giant Lululemon Athletica Inc. (Nasdaq:LULU).

Avison Young said Microsoft has inked a deal for 65000 square feet at 989 Granville St. and is “widely rumoured” to have acquired 405000 square feet of space at the B6 building which is expected to complete construction during the fourth quarter of next year. The two deals would mean the tech giant has secured 468000 square feet during the first half of this year alone.

Lululemon is the only company that might come close to keeping pace with Microsoft’s expansion nabbing 130000 square feet at Burrard Place and 107000 square feet at 1380 Burrard St. for a total of 237000 square feet leased so far this year.

This comes even as Lululemon has plans to open a new headquarters totalling nearly 600000 square feet in the False Creek Flats area just outside downtown.

Despite office space becoming more abundant in recent months throughout downtown Vancouver vacancy rates across the Metro Vancouver region shrunk from 8.4 per cent to 7.8 per cent when comparing the first six months of 2021 and 2022 respectively.

As we told you $1.6M of that comes from Wednesday night fan screenings hence Thursday’s $5M ties with the preview cash of the franchise’s previous chapter War for the Planet of the Apes.

That preview number is above Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire ($4.7M) which saw a $45M 3-day opening and it’s under the $7.2M posted by Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny which turned in a $60.4M domestic start.

The Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is playing in 4075 theaters on all premium screens including 40 Imax 950 PLFs 300 Dbox/4D Motion screens and 90 Screen X locations.

Rest of the week is as follows:

Fall Guy (Uni) 4002 theaters Thu $1.5M (-8% from Wed) Total $36M/Wk 1 Challengers (AMZ MGM) 3477 theaters Thu $897K (-5%) Wk $11.5M Total $33.3M/Wk 2 Star Wars – Phantom Menace (Dis) 2700 theaters Thu $347K (-19%) Wk $10.5M/Total $484.9M lifetime/Wk 1 re-release Tarot (Sony) 3104 theaters Thu $466K (+7%) Wk $8.5M/Wk 1 Godzilla x Kong (Leg/WB) 2884 theatres Thu $233K (-14%) Wk $5.7M Total $189.3M/Wk 6

EXCLUSIVE: Sources tell us that 20th Century Studios’ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is off to a good start with previews around $6.5M. That’s comprised of Thursday night money which began accruing at 3PM and around $1.6M from Wednesday fan shows that began at 7PM.

We’ll know tomorrow AM if it’s the best Thursday night ever for an Apes movie besting 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes which did $5M on its preview night before a $22.1M Friday and $56.2M opening. This Wes Ball directed PG-13 sequel takes place 300 years after the events of Matt Reeves’ War for the Planet of the Apes.

Already Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes‘ Thursday has bested that of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes’ which did $4.25M before minting a $27.6M Friday and massive 3-day of $72.6M still a record domestic debut for the Apes‘ franchise.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ is 82% on Rotten Tomatoes with critics and 82% with RT audiences.

Tonight’s results are a bit of fresh air next to the $3.15M Wednesday and Thursday previews of Universal’s Fall Guy last weekend which fizzled with a $27.7M opening. While fans always populate Thursday night shows hopefully Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes at a 2 hours and 25 minutes running time can hold it together throughout the weekend.

Hands down tonight it’s the best preview cash for a Ball movie beating all of his Maze Runner titles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9vcGluaW9ucy9yZWNsaW5pbmctc2VhdC1yYWdlLWFpcnBsYW5lLXBhc3NlbmdlcnMtcG9vbGUvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBWWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvb3BpbmlvbnMvcmVjbGluaW5nLXNlYXQtcmFnZS1haXJwbGFuZS1wYXNzZW5nZXJzLXBvb2xl?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion: I’m a flight attendant. You need to get over your reclining seat rage,"Editor’s Note: Heather Poole is a flight attendant for a major US carrier and author of “Cruising Attitude: Tales of Crashpads Crew Drama and Crazy Passengers at 30000 Feet.” The views in this commentary are her own. Read more CNN Opinion.

CNN —

Last night on a flight from London to New York a passenger rang his call light and when my colleague walked over turned off the light and asked him if he needed something he simply pointed to the reclined seat in front of him.

Heather Poole courtesy Heather Poole

The flight attendant told him that his seat was also in the reclined position and then mentioned that the seat next to him — the aisle seat — was available and that he could sit there. The man said he didn’t want to move to the aisle seat because he wanted to sit by the window.

Sometimes there are no solutions to problems like this.

Another day another flight: “If you put your seat back one more time I’m going to punch you in the face” said an older woman to a teenage girl seated in front of her. The young girl’s eyes looked like they might pop out of their sockets.

While standing in the aisle pouring a can of Diet Coke into a cup of ice I told the aggrieved passenger that nobody was going to punch anyone and that if she said another word about it or did anything to anyone authorities would be called to meet the flight.

“He’s in my lap!” cried a different passenger on a different flight. This one sat in the window seat.

I looked at the woman and then at the man in front who was clearly not in her lap. He was close though about a foot away. Sorry I mouthed. I handed her a can of club soda and a cup of ice and communicated to her in words I knew she’d understand: “Unfortunately he’s allowed to be in your lap.”

Besides lack of wifi or a broken entertainment system flight attendants hear more complaints about reclined seats than anything else.

The heart of the problem is that airlines are packing too many seats too closely together into a tight space. Remember legroom? But this squeeze doesn’t give passengers the right to react in such a way that the crew feels the need to divert a flight to have a passenger removed. That’s a really big deal that usually ends up with someone in police custody.

While I dread these altercations I think some passengers need to chill out — people have the right to recline their seat. Nobody has to ask for permission to recline their seat. Some people believe passengers have to put their seats in the upright position during the meal service. This isn’t true. At least not with US carriers even though it’s a nice thing to do.

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. Heather Poole

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. If you kick the seat or threaten to punch someone in the face you’ll be the one removed from the flight — not the person who moved their seat back two inches.

Not all airlines are created equal. Yes some airlines are taking away the recline option on all seats but these are mostly low-cost carriers which should tell you something about what those passengers want: cheap flights … including seats that don’t recline. (A friend who often flies Air France on short and medium-hop routes in Europe tells me that their seats are all locked upright. “I’ve never seen anyone get worked up about it” he said.)

Airlines are desperate to cut costs. It’s rumored that American Airlines removed a single olive off of business class meal trays and saved $40000 a year. So you’d think that 150 lighter seats per flight will certainly save an airline a ton of money. Remember the recline mechanism in the seat makes it heavier which increases fuel costs for the airline. A lighter seat that doesn’t recline is also a seat that is less likely to break which saves an airline money in repairs.

Non-reclining seats are nothing new. Major carriers have always had a few seats that don’t recline. Think exit rows and the last row. While some passengers aren’t always happy to get one of these seats it never seems to be that big of a deal.

But after 28 years in the job I’ve found there’s some basic reclining etiquette that makes for a smoother flight for everyone.

A reminder: chances are the person in front of you has no idea they’ve crossed that mental barrier between you and the rest of the world. You can’t kick them or scream at them but you can politely ask if they’d mind putting their seat back up. I bet if you ask nicely they’ll do it.

If you’re a passenger who likes to recline it’s always a good idea to be mindful of the situation that we are all collectively in and do so slowly. Yanking the seat back too quickly could make a mess if the person behind you has their tray table down.

Sure everyone feels cramped in coach seats. But the bigger you are the tighter the squeeze so consider glancing back before you adjust your seat. If it’s Shaquille O’Neal behind you maybe give the guy a break.

We do see spilled drinks and from time to time broken laptops. Seasoned business passengers know what to expect and book seats with more legroom. But on coach middle seat passengers struggle to type because there’s no arm space. The table is so much smaller these days and there’s barely room for a drink. So if you think you’re going to work on your laptop and balance a cup of coffee on that table well you might need to seriously rethink your spatial judgement.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned flying the unfriendly skies it’s this: you can’t please everyone. Somebody is going to suffer somebody is going to have a miserable flight somebody will be assigned the last row or a middle seat or will have to come into contact with a child. Now I’m going to tell you what I used to tell my son when he was little every time we traveled together: there’s no crying in flying. Toughen up.

Really this isn’t a war on reclined seats. This is about space and most airlines give you the option to purchase more space. So remember that next time you’re searching for the cheapest flight.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL255cG9zdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS91cy1uZXdzL2JpbGxpb25haXJlLWJ1bGx5LWthdGhlcmluZS1hc3BsdW5kaHMtbmV3LWluLWxhd3MtaGF2ZS05NW0taGlzdG9yeS1vZi1leHBsb2l0aW5nLXVuZG9jdW1lbnRlZC13b3JrZXJzL9IBkAFodHRwczovL255cG9zdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS91cy1uZXdzL2JpbGxpb25haXJlLWJ1bGx5LWthdGhlcmluZS1hc3BsdW5kaHMtbmV3LWluLWxhd3MtaGF2ZS05NW0taGlzdG9yeS1vZi1leHBsb2l0aW5nLXVuZG9jdW1lbnRlZC13b3JrZXJzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Billionaire bully Katherine Asplundh's new in-laws have $95M history of exploiting undocumented workers: ruling,"Pennsylvania’s billionaire Asplundh family were dragged into a bullying scandal after their son’s new wife tried to force another woman to give up her Instagram handle — and now it has emerged they were once fined $95 million for hiring undocumented workers.

According to a 2017 press release from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Asplundh Tree Experts now reportedly worth $5 billion pleaded guilty to employing workers it knew were using false identification papers and received the fine.

According to the release upper managers “remained willfully blind while lower level managers hired and rehired employees they knew to be ineligible to work in the United States.”

The company paid $80 million in criminal forfeiture and $15 million in civil payment.

The $95 million total is still the recordholder for the largest immigration judgment in history.

The family name came under the microscope again this week when Katherine Driscoll Asplundh — who married Cabot Asplundh on April 27 — allegedly tried to bully a user with the name Katherine Asplundh into signing over the rights to her Instagram handle.

According to screenshots of the conversation posted to the NYCInfluencesnark sub Reddit the new Katherine Asplundh started off with a breezy message.

“Hi just wondering if I could purchase your username from you” the newlywed wrote.

“I just got married and this is my new name.”

The other Katherine Asplundh politely refused.

“Hi congrats! That’s my name too” she wrote. “I just googled and it said selling my username would get me banned from Instagram.”

From there things deteriorated between the two Katherine Asplundhs.

“I purchased my username in the past actually that’s not true” responded the billionaire’s wife.

“Celebrities do it all the time that’s how they all have their handles as their full names. So weird I didn’t know there was another Asplundh’s family out there [sic]. There no Katherine Asplundh in our family.”

Upon receiving no response the billionaire’s wife pointed out that the other Katherine wasn’t very active on Instagram and should therefore change her name to accommodate her.

The other Katherine then told the billionaire’s wife that the account was a “finsta” or fake Instagram that she uses for private stories and archiving photos and that her main account uses her maiden name.

Irritated Driscoll-Asplundh argued that the other woman’s name wasn’t really Katherine Asplundh and that she would be reported.

“I actually don’t believe that your name is Katherine Asplundh who would make their finsta their actual name? I reported you to Instagram and they’re actually able to tell me your real name I really hope I don’t know you because that’s gonna be really embarrassing for you.”

Driscoll-Asplundh then demanded to see documentation that the other woman was not lying about her name.

After the other woman posted the screenshots the newlywed deleted her Instagram account.

The new bride’s in-laws own the Asplundh Tree Expert Co. in Pennsylvania which is the 109th-largest private company in America with a revenue of $5.42 billion in 2023 according to Forbes.

Sales at the celebrity chef’s dining establishments which range from his Michelin-starred flagship Restaurant Gordon Ramsay to Street Burger rose by 21% to £95.6m in the year to 27 August. The group took on 290 more staff after a tough time during the pandemic lockdowns.

However pre-tax losses rose to £3.4m from £1.05m a year before after £4.9m of one-off costs the vast majority of which related to pre-opening costs for new restaurants including a Lucky Cat outlet in Manchester a Bread Street Kitchen outlet in Battersea power station and a Street Pizza outlet in Edinburgh.

Ramsay also bought the Shoreditch eatery Pizza East. Underlying earnings excluding one-off costs tax and write-downs rose to £8.3m from £6.2m.

While losses worsened during the year they still mark a turnaround from the pandemic which brought Ramsay’s business operations to a halt and forcing him to cut almost 300 jobs amid £12m in losses.

Ramsay said: “It’s been a really hard-fought year but at the same time an exciting year and in tough times it amazes me how strong and vibrant our industry is. It’s challenging out there and businesses are battling to stay afloat rising costs rent and food costs multiple strikes. It’s a battle.

“However I genuinely don’t think there’s been a year since I opened my first restaurant in 1998 where there has been so much passion and vibrancy in our industry.

“People still want to go out break bread and have a good time together. We’ve still got something wonderful to celebrate and I truly believe the industry has never been so exciting.”

Ramsay who opened his first solo venture Gordon Ramsay at Royal Hospital Road in Chelsea in 1998 said he was on track to surpass £100m of sales this year.

He intends to opens five new restaurants within London’s new skyscraper 22 Bishopsgate – including Lucky Cat and its roof terrace on level 60 making it the capital’s highest restaurant.

The development will also include an outpost of Bread Street Kitchen and Bar and a 14-seat chef’s table from Restaurant Gordon Ramsay the chef’s Michelin-starred Chelsea venue and the Gordon Ramsay Academy where culinary enthusiasts can hone their skills.

Ramsay said: “This is more than just a new opening – it’s a significant milestone for our business. We’re not only launching the highest culinary experiences in London but also creating a vibrant culinary hub at the incredible 22 Bishopsgate.”

Ramsay also has an academy in Woking Surrey where the accounts note the local council loaned his group more than £1.6m in 2021 repayable over 25 years at 3.5% to help with the fit-out of the venture and its neighbouring Street Burger restaurant."

MAR,Marriott International,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRyYWRlZGVzay5jb20vdXMvcmVzb3VyY2UtZGVzay9ob3ctbWFycmlvdHQtcmV3cm90ZS10aGUtcnVsZXMtb2YtcmV0YXJnZXRpbmfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Marriott rewrote the rules of retargeting,"Identifying the audience

The first step for Marriott was identifying who visited their site with the intent to book a room. This is where The Trade Desk’s universal pixel and tracking capabilities helped Marriott better understand its visitors. By placing The Trade Desk’s pixels on their web properties Marriott can capture data and insights across all its brand sites. Signals such as desired destination and travel dates can be passed within a single pixel fire. Digitas can then segment the audience and retarget across all channels including display video native audio and Connected TV.

With the audience established and advertising creative in place Digitas applied The Trade Desk’s Dynamic Creative Rules feature. This allows Marriott to easily pass relevant first-party data to its ad server Jivox which in turn assembles personalized ads in real time based on several data sources including Marriott’s reservation system (for room availability and price) and first-party customer data (traveler’s location language etc.) via The Trade Desk platform.

To reach as many visitors as possible Digitas layered on The Trade Desk’s Identity Alliance a solution that allows Marriott to incorporate device data from all the major industry players — Tapad LiveRamp Oracle Data Cloud and Adbrain — to enable high-quality cross-device targeting and measurement at the user level. This ensures that Marriott targets consumers across all device types not just the device that a visitor originally used to search for a hotel. As a result of applying this advanced capability Marriott expanded its audience reach by over 272 percent.

The impact: a 289 percent increase in bookings. Travelers also booked faster — an average of five days after being retargeted instead of the usual eight — boosting return on ad spend by 65 percent.

Earlier this year Apple launched its new ‘Tap to Pay’ feature which leverages near-field contact (NFC) technology to allow merchants to accept Apple Pay contactless card payments and digital wallet payments on an iPhone with no additional hardware needed.

In May Apple faced ire from the European Commission after it notified the firm over its anti-competitive decision to limit mobile wallet app developers’ access to its contactless payments hardware and software.

The Commission said that by limiting access to the “standard technology” of near-field communication (NFC) Apple has restricted competition in the mobile wallets market on its mobile operating system iOS.

And in July it was reported the California-based tech firm is being sued in the US over alleged anti-trust violations relating to its Apple Pay mobile wallet.

Warren urging credit card companies to track gun purchases,"Guns in a display case are pictured at Impact Guns in South Salt Lake on Wednesday July 6 2022. Democrats are urging Visa MasterCard and American Express to flag suspicious purchases to fight gun crime.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren D-Mass. and a group of nearly 40 congressional Democrats are urging credit card companies to track gun and ammunition purchases. It would be the first step to facilitating the collection of data that could help law enforcement identify domestic terrorism threats they say in a letter sent last week to executives at Mastercard Visa and American Express.

“Mass shooters have repeatedly financed deadly massacres using credit cards and Bank CEOs need to step up to save lives” Warren said. “Financial institutions and payment networks such as Visa MasterCard and American Express can and should do everything they can to help law enforcement prevent some mass shootings by identifying suspicious gun purchases through the implementation of this new code.”

Warren and the other lawmakers want the credit card companies to create a four-digit code to identify gun and ammunition purchases. Known as a merchant category code it would allow the financial institutions to flag suspicious patterns of transactions to fight gun crime they said.

The credit card companies are already required to use merchant category codes to look out for money laundering terrorism and other suspicious behavior. As of right now gun stores aren’t marked as a separate class of merchants in the online financial system.

Other Democrats across the nation have also encouraged the credit card companies to create a merchant category code for gun merchants. New York Attorney General Rob Bonta and California Attorney General Letitia James said in a joint letter “if tracking MCCs could stop just one mass shooting or derail one gun trafficker aiming to flood the streets with guns the change would be justified.”

A Mastercard spokesman told the Wall Street Journal that its are reviewing how a gun store merchant category code would be implemented in its network. “This will help us continue to deliver a payments system that supports all legal purchases while protecting the privacy and decisions of individual cardholders” he said.

The National Rifle Association responded to the Democrats’ request by questioning the intent of the proposal and said they worry about the actual effect it would have on gun purchasers.

“Implying that firearm purchases are suspicious demonstrates an obvious bias these attorneys general hold against choosing to exercise a fundamental constitutional right’’ spokesman Lars Dalseide told the Journal.

The International Organization for Standardization decides what merchant category codes are used to classify merchants by their purpose of business. The ISO is scheduled to meet in Oslo Norway this November. Executives from each of the three credit card companies sit on review committees for ISO where they could sway the vote."

The start of Thursday’s match between Nice and Cologne was delayed by about an hour because of fights among supporters in the stands at Allianz Riviera stadium. The game ended 1-1.

Prosecutors opened three investigations on Friday into the violence not only inside the stadium but also outside it as well as in downtown Nice French media reported. The goal is to “identify and arrest” those responsible.

The disorder is also subject to a UEFA disciplinary case with eight charges against Nice including failure to screen and search spectators and three against Cologne.

The French government’s administrator for the region said on Friday the violence took place despite a heavy police presence and security planning coordinated through both clubs and UEFA.

Bernard Gonzalez prefect for the Alpes-Maritimes region said thousands of German fans began consuming alcohol early Thursday in downtown bars and some of their behavior was “unacceptable.”

The German fans identified to be “most at risk” were supposed to be placed in a secure part of the stadium but they broke free alongside some Parisian hooligans and kicked off the violence Gonzalez continued.

In total 650 police and gendarmes were mobilized as well as 600 stadium stewards.

Four people were brought to the hospital including one — identified as a Parisian — who sustained serious but not life-threatening injuries in a fall. Two police officers and one steward were among those injured and treated at the stadium Gonzalez said.

Paris Saint-Germain condemned the violence after it emerged that fans from a banned group of hardcore PSG supporters took part in the clashes.

PSG said in a statement it has been deeply engaged over the past 10 years in preventing soccer violence and pointed out that the Supras Auteuil fan group was disbanded in 2010. PSG said it does not recognize its members as PSG supporters and insisted they are banned from entering the club’s stadium in Paris.

PSG had serious problems with hooliganism from 1985 to 2010. The club then took measures to combat the problem and radically changed its ticketing policy.

“The club shall consider what action to take for the damage to its reputation caused by the actions of such individuals” PSG said.

They have strung together two impressive group stage wins over Edward Gaming and Paper Rex advancing out of Group A.

The European team is now set to face their toughest challenge yet when they go up against Masters Reykjavik 2022 champions OpTic Gaming in the upper bracket quarterfinals of the playoffs.

The match will also mark the first clash between North America and Europe in the playoffs — an age-old rivalry between two of the strongest regions in Valorant.

Team Liquid ScreaM doesn’t rate North America as the best region in Valorant

ScreaM fanned the flames of the rivalry during the Valorant Champions 2022 pre-tournament press conference hosted by Riot Games.

“I wouldn’t rate North America right now as one of the best regions” said ScreaM. “I think EMEA and APAC are better.”

EMEA and APAC teams were the two finalists at Masters Copenhagen and they had come into Champions as heavy favorites.

However Liquid had Paper Rex’s number in their group stage decider match walking away with the 2-1 victory. In the post-match press conference ScreaM remained confident about his next opponent in OpTic Gaming.

Team Liquid’s captain said that OpTic is a good match-up for his team even though he considers them the best team in North America. While he acknowledged that the series would not be a walk in the park he said that APAC teams were still tougher to play against.

“It is not going to be an easy match-up but I prefer to play against North America than APAC” he said.

“They’re going to do things that we know not weird stuff that we cannot expect” he said. “I cannot wait to go up against OpTic. I think it will be a good match.”

Paper Rex in particular are known for their unorthodox agent compositions and unpredictable aggression.

Against Edward Gaming Wang “Jinggg” Jing Jie pulled off a nearly undodgeable Raze ultimate that caught the Chinese squad by surprise. From the top of the crate at B Link he satcheled into the air with his Raze’s Showstopper ultimate catching EDG’s Viper walking down B Main.

Liquid also fell victim to Paper Rex’s creative play in their Group A decider match. At the start of Round 15 Jinggg satchel boosted himself on top of Khalish “d4v41” Rusyaidee’s Sage wall that was placed on top of the crate at B Link. From the high vantage point Jinggg had an angle toward B Main allowing him to get the drop on the enemy Fade.

At Valorant Champions 2022 however North America has racked up more wins against EMEA in the group stage. XSET defeated FunPlus Phoenix 2-1 in Group C while 100 Thieves won their opening match against Fnatic 2-1 in Group D.

Nevertheless Europe managed to bounce back with Fnatic getting revenge on 100 Thieves in the decider match.

Team Liquid will face OpTic Gaming on September 10 at 10:00 p.m. GMT+8 | 7:00 a.m. PT | 2:00 p.m. GMT. The match will be broadcast live on the official Valorant Twitch and YouTube channels.

The app gives users a way to share photos and videos of their travels post about an upcoming trip arrange meetups with others and learn about new travel destinations.

What’s most notable is the Tinder-like feature in the “Discover” tab that allows users to vote on photos from people around the world by swiping left or right much like you do on matches.

After catching the travel bug 25-year-old Ethan Serbantes founded the startup to create a niche social platform where travelers could make connections and easily find new experiences.

Social media has transformed how we travel and millennials and Gen Zers consumed by wanderlust often go to Instagram for inspiration. Travel company Arrivia surveyed over 2000 Americans between December 2021 and January 2022 and found that 60% of Gen Zers and 40% of millennials use social media for vacation ideas for instance.

However browsing the internet for destinations can be time consuming the founder noted. While Instagram was where everyone was sharing vacation spots Serbantes said the locations he scrolled through on the platform didn’t have enough information for people who actually wanted to travel there. It also doesn’t help that you have to scroll past selfies and other posts that have nothing to do with the area.

Based on his own traveling experience Serbantes also realized that it can be hard to meet new people as a solo traveler. Travel booking platform Klook found that 49% of respondents were nervous about traveling solo because they didn’t want to be lonely in a foreign place.

With a team of six other people Serbantes designed OfftheGrid to “address the fragmented travel planning process and solo traveler problems” Serbantes told TechCrunch.

OfftheGrid aims to be a platform for travelers to connect with each other and share their experiences. Users can post their photos and videos on the main homepage of the app and see posts from travelers they follow.

Travello another social network app designed for travelers works similarly. However OfftheGrid has a swiping feature where users swipe left or right on a person’s post whether that’s a photo of a beach mountain or maybe a nice park. Users can like comment and favorite a photo to look at later by using the bookmark icon.

But there’s a catch: Once a user sees a photo of a place they’re interested in they need to have 10 in-app coins to reveal the information. For every swipe they gain one coin. Once unlocked there will be a description and a map where you can see where in the world the destination is.

There are also options to watch a video ad to earn the coins for free or buy coins. Users can pay $0.99 for 100 coins $1.99 for 300 coins and $4.99 for 600 coins.

The app’s “Trips” tab meanwhile allows users to meet up with other travelers. People post where they’re traveling and how long they’ll be there then others connect with them to offer any advice or arrange to meet. There’s a limit on how many people you can message per day. After chatting with three individuals the traveler has to again use coins to chat with additional people.

Of course it’s important that travelers stay safe when going to foreign places. While it can be fun to socialize with new people you also need to be wary of meeting up with strangers.

“Safety is a main priority of ours” Serbantes said.

For starters the app permits users to verify their email phone number and Facebook account. At launch OfftheGrid doesn’t have a system that verifies profile photos but Serbantes said the startup is working on implementing a photo identification API. OfftheGrid also plans on launching a blue checkmark system for verified profiles.

However as dating apps have shown what users really need are background checks — which is why Match Group began integrating the option this year into its apps like Tinder after horror stories of violence stalking and assault began to emerge from its users. OfftheGrid does not include such a feature so travelers will need to be careful of who they chat with and choose to meet.

OfftheGrid also has a “Explore” tab — a discovery tool for interacting with a map that has the most liked and trending content on the app. There’s a search option if users want to jump to a specific location and filters such as “Wildlife” “Parks/Trails” “Shopping” “Museums/Galleries” and “Food.”

OfftheGrid is a bootstrapped startup which means the company is self-funded and doesn’t rely on investors and external sources.

Serbantes said the company has a lot of plans for the app down the road. This includes a subscription model that allows subscribers to unlock photos and connect with as many people as they want. An organizational feature is in the works as well which lets users plan an itinerary based on photos they’ve liked on the app.

Another feature rolling out to the app is a “Locals” section within the “Trips” tab for users to find people within the area to reach out to.

Serbantes mentioned that in the future OfftheGrid would be hosting monthly photo competitions. The photos with the most likes are accurately geotagged will win. The details of what the prizes are have yet to be decided.

The travel app can be downloaded on the App Store and Google Play Store and is recommended for users 18 years old and up."
MKC,McCormick & Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL3RydW1wLWJhY2tlZC1zZW5hdGUtaG9wZWZ1bC1kYXZlLW1jY29ybWljay1oYXMtZXh0ZW5zaXZlLWRlZXAtc3RhdGUtdGllc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trump-Backed Senate Hopeful Dave McCormick Has Extensive 'Deep State' Ties,"As he runs for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania Dave McCormick’s claims to his “home state” have been a source of contention on the campaign trail: the Republican hedge fund titan spent much of his youth in Pennsylvania but has lived out most of his recent adult and professional days in Connecticut.

While the extent of McCormick’s ties to his “home state” are cloudy his ties to another state—the “deep state”—seem far more clear.

Despite his claims to the MAGA movement McCormick is steeped in the nexus of government intelligence and big business that Donald Trump and his acolytes ambiguously refer to as “the deep state.”

Those connections range from colleagues to boards to corporate investments with additional ties to notorious surveillance systems and an internal monitoring project at McCormick’s firm—the legendary hedge fund Bridgewater Associates—that was directly modeled after the Chinese Communist Party’s autocratic surveillance state.

And in the mind of Trump who is McCormick’s most crucial political ally some of those ties would be about as problematic as a MAGA Republican can get—such as for instance former FBI Director James Comey.

Comey it turns out accepted a senior role at Bridgewater the year after McCormick signed on as the fund’s president. As general counsel Comey oversaw an internal security program whose invasive and sometimes demeaning methods of surveillance and interrogation earned him a reputation as Bridgewater’s “in-house inquisitor.”

Aside from Comey the most prominent of McCormick’s “deep state” affiliations is his recent three-year run as a paid trustee of the secretive government-backed investment group In-Q-Tel—quite literally the Central Intelligence Agency’s very own venture capital firm.

McCormick’s role at In-Q-Tel appears on his candidate financial disclosures where he listed the entity’s name as “IQT.” Tax filings from In-Q-Tel which is registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit show that McCormick joined as a trustee in March 2018 and left in 2022 as he pursued his first Senate campaign. He collected an annual $35000 salary logging five hours of work a week according to the tax records and his election bid has since seen hundreds of thousands of dollars in support from executives tied to IQT and its investments.

For McCormick his deep state connections embody the larger political contradictions he’s already been forced to reconcile as a corporate Republican seeking office in the quasi-populist era of Trump.

That tortured balancing act failed two years ago. In the 2022 GOP primary in Pennsylvania the lifelong moderate failed to land Trump’s endorsement—losing that honor and subsequently the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz.

While McCormick got the coveted Trump endorsement this year—though there weren’t any other viable Republicans running in the primary—the dissonance is starker than ever.

Today the MAGA wing of the Republican Party finds itself fully enthralled with conspiracy theories about the intelligence community which Trump and his allies have for years cast as public enemy No. 1. Trump is vowing retribution as a key 2024 campaign plank.

Given that McCormick’s challenge to Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) will be one of the most contentious races of the 2024 cycle the hedge funder turned true MAGA believer may have to work harder than expected to scrub his deep establishment ties in order to appeal to his new base.

A former colleague of McCormick’s at Bridgewater told The Daily Beast that McCormick was “an honorable man” a “stand-up guy” and an “independent” and “brilliant leader.” But the colleague also put his finger on the Trump issue calling it a “sad reality” that McCormick will have to cave to the whims of the former president.

“He knows that if he wins he won’t get to do what he thinks is right” the person said. “He has his own money and he won’t be so susceptible to outside pressures financially. But he’s still going to have to kiss the ring and that’s unfortunate.”

McCormick’s campaign did not respond to detailed questions for this article.

It’s not clear if Trump knew about McCormick’s work with the U.S. intelligence community including the CIA and Comey. But as it turns out the deep state overlaps in myriad ways with McCormick’s 13-year tenure as a top executive at Bridgewater.

In 2010—the year after McCormick left George W. Bush’s Treasury Department to sign on as Bridgewater’s president—Bridgewater hired Comey who would later come to embody the darkest of Trump’s paranoiac accusations about federal agents.

Bridgewater brought Comey on officially as head of security and general counsel. In practice however Comey’s role more closely resembled that of an “in-house inquisitor” over the first iteration of the firm’s oppressive internal employee monitoring program which would later come to be called “The Politburo.”

Before he led the FBI unleashed a bombshell on Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign and got fired by Trump Comey reportedly raked in $7 million per year at Bridgewater. His task was to keep employees in line with the goals of what firm founder Ray Dalio called “radical transparency.” Those efforts included constant surveillance—including recorded meetings and videotaped internal “trials” of employees—with Dalio telling Bridgewater staff that Comey was “like a godfather adjudicating it all.”

The taped meetings were “just the tip of the surveillance ecosystem” at Bridgewater Vanity Fair reported in its profile of Comey’s time with the firm.

“A slew of ex FBI agents staffed the security team. Not only did cameras cover seemingly every inch of the property but they seemed to be watched in real time. Staffers who left their desks even briefly would return to sticky notes left on their computer monitors admonishing them for failing to put up a screen saver” Vanity Fair reported.

Comey would go through employee cellphone and computer records and was apparently so intrusive that he embarrassed one executive into resigning.

But when Comey’s security posse only turned up “little evidence of actual offending behavior to snuff out they created their own” according to Vanity Fair.

In one instance the report said Comey left an executive’s binder clearly labeled and unattended in Bridgewater offices. He then watched as surveillance cameras captured a low-ranking employee discovering the binder and going through it. Comey put the employee on trial and fired him with the approval of Dalio.

Comey however eventually found himself repelled by Dalio’s extremes resigning after two years. (This month Comey happens to be publishing a murder mystery novel that takes place inside a fictionalized version of Bridgewater.)

Dalio however only ramped things up implementing more and more intrusive policies to fully enact his “radical transparency” dogma.

That program it turns out was literally modeled on the Chinese Communist Party’s social surveillance program which Dalio openly admired. He even named the project after the CCP’s own “Politburo” and compared it favorably to “Big Brother” in a 60 Minutes interview.

China of course is another area where McCormick is against the prevailing GOP winds as Bridgewater’s internal culture “reflects aspects of Chinese political ideology” and invested heavily in the region—after McCormick took over as co-CEO in 2017 the fund’s Chinese investments skyrocketed.

The “Politburo” staffed up with officials from the National Security Agency and the CIA. But Bridgewater workers found it “intimidating” and “humiliating” and so intrusive that in 2017 one whistleblower filed a human rights complaint with the state of Connecticut where the fund is headquartered which was covered at the time in The New York Times.

As detailed in a recent book about Dalio titled The Fund the Politburo essentially pitted its employees against each other assigning roles like “auditors” and “overseers” and recording practically every moment of activity—all in pursuit of Dalio’s core “radical transparency” philosophy.

While the system repelled many employees—including Comey and one-time CEO Jon Rubinstein who both left after disagreements with Dalio—McCormick stayed aboard got a promotion and publicly defended Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Rubinstein quit after a “firing squad” meeting that McCormick personally sat in on according to the book where Rubinstein made the case that Dalio’s increasingly authoritarian policies were creating a “climate of fear.” When McCormick one of a handful of senior executives in the room was personally asked if he agreed with Rubinstein’s take he said he did not according to the book.

McCormick has subsequently defended Dalio. In 2020 when McCormick was asked if he took issue with a fundamental contradiction at the core of the monitoring program—“radical transparency” within the company but kept secret from outside scrutiny—he replied that he “doesn’t think it’s inconsistent at all.”

“Ray has always said this: Radical transparency is not total transparency. There are certain things that we’re not transparent about and consciously so. Personnel and salary discussions for example” McCormick said.

Shortly after rising to co-CEO McCormick joined the board at IQT.

The venture capital nonprofit which former CIA Director George Tenet founded in 1999 has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds to hundreds of technology firms and startups some of which are still secret.

Today IQT oversees more than $1 billion in assets and even has its own special-purpose acquisition company. Though the group keeps a low profile IQT maintains a close relationship with government intelligence and security divisions and runs “almost all investment decisions” by the CIA.

Many IQT investments seek to cultivate the private development of surveillance technology that could one day benefit the intelligence community and some of them overlap with both Bridgewater and McCormick.

One of those companies is Palantir a tech firm closely tied to right-wing financier Peter Thiel whose sprawling government work has made it a lightning rod for civil rights controversy—and whose fate was “rescued” by IQT’s investment.

Bridgewater itself helped fund Palantir and incorporated Palantir technology to advance its own investments as well as to help monitor Bridgewater employees in the fund’s pursuit of Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Palantir executives have contributed thousands of dollars to McCormick’s 2024 campaign.

Additionally one of IQT’s current trustees Howard Fox who also served on the board with McCormick has put serious money—more than $150000—behind McCormick’s candidacy in both 2022 and this cycle.

The same is true of other McCormick supporters like the CEO of Tenable an IQT-backed tech firm which announced its public stock offering shortly after McCormick joined the board.

And while it’s true that McCormick brings his own money to the table that hasn’t stopped Bridgewater donors from chipping in. In all Bridgewater employees mostly executives have contributed about $100000 to McCormick’s political aspirations with current president Kyle Delaney throwing $50000 to a 2022 super PAC backing his old colleague.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3N0LWdhemV0dGUuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9zdGVlbGVycy8yMDI0LzA1LzEwL25mbC1kcmFmdC1uZXdzLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay1zb3V0aC1kYWtvdGEtc3RhdGUtbWF0dC16aW1tZXIvc3Rvcmllcy8yMDI0MDUxMDAwMDHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will Mason McCormick contribute to the Steelers' OL in 2024?,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gvbmV3cy9jYXNleS1nb2VzLWFmdGVyLW1jY29ybWljay1vbi1jb25uZWN0aWN1dC1yZXNpZGVuY3kv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gvbmV3cy9jYXNleS1nb2VzLWFmdGVyLW1jY29ybWljay1vbi1jb25uZWN0aWN1dC1yZXNpZGVuY3kv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sen. Bob Casey goes after Dave McCormick on Connecticut residency,"PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — The race between Sen. Bob Casey and his Republican challenger former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick is expected to be one of the most hotly contested elections in the nation.

Casey's name is synonymous with Pennsylvania especially Scranton. But it didn't take Casey long to label McCormick a Connecticut Yankee for living outside the state for many years.

""He hasn't told the truth about where he lives"" Casey said. ""He lives in Connecticut. He hasn't been truthful about that. So you have an out-of-state candidate who's being supported by out-of-state billionaires.""

KDKA-TV's Jon Delano: ""Where do you live?""

McCormick: ""I live in Pennsylvania. I live in Pittsburgh.""

Just before his run for U.S. Senate in 2022 McCormick who is divorced and remarried sold his home in Connecticut bought a home in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill and rented another home in Connecticut.

""My youngest daughter lives with her mother in Connecticut so I periodically go back to Connecticut to see my daughter. Being a good dad is even more important than being a good senator"" McCormick said.

McCormick grew up in Bloomsburg where his father was president of Bloomsburg University. But he also lived outside the state working first for the Bush administration and then as president and CEO of Bridgewater Associates a Connecticut-based multi-billion dollar hedge fund from 2009 to 2022.

McCormick sees the Connecticut residency issue as a distraction from Casey's record.

""When you have the results that Bob Casey has with inflation border crime the war on oil and gas the world falling apart what do you do? Well you try to make it about something that is unrelated in your opponent"" McCormick said.

But Casey says McCormick's long out-of-state residency coupled with his work for a hedge fund associated with multi-millionaires demonstrates who he will represent in the Senate.

""He hadn't voted in Pennsylvania in about 16 years. So I think that's going to be an issue. But I think ultimately it's going to be about whose side you are on"" Casey said.

Casey sees himself as representing hard-working middle-class Pennsylvanians while McCormick argues that Casey has failed to deliver any results.

McCormick criticizes Casey for supporting President Biden's infrastructure bill CHIPS and Science Act the Inflation Reduction Act and other bills.

""Bob Casey has been a 98% vote for Joe Biden"" McCormick said.

Casey sees himself as a soft-spoken doer who gets things done for this part of Pennsylvania.

""The bridge investment alone is about a quarter of a billion dollars just for bridges"" Casey said. ""But there's investments for K-12 education investments for communities all across the board whether it was in the infrastructure bill the American Rescue legislation or otherwise. So we've been able to get resources to communities to try to lift them up but we still have work to do so I want to keep delivering.""

The two candidates disagree on other issues as well like abortion. Casey who is personally pro-life supports the Women's Health Protection Act to codify abortion rights nationwide while McCormick opposes abortion with limited exceptions and opposes all federal legislation on the subject.

""Our states should decide"" McCormick said. ""Pennsylvania should decide as it has. My belief is that we shouldn't have bans. We shouldn't have national legislation.""

Casey says McCormick's work at the hedge fund to promote China will be another issue.

""When China cheats Pennsylvania loses jobs. So he's helped to fuel that rise of China and I think that's going to be a major issue in the campaign"" Casey said.

Delano: ""So you're suggesting he's soft on China?""

Casey: ""I don't think there's any question about it compared to what I've been doing.""

""I've been in business"" McCormick said. ""Yes my business did 2% of its business in China. I know what it's like to negotiate against the Chinese in the government and in business. There is no one better equipped to deal with the challenge of China than me.""

These are just a few of many issues on which Casey and McCormick disagree.

On Day 1 of Steelers rookie minicamp at the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex on the South Side McCormick worked primarily at right guard a position he barely played while with the Jackrabbits.

Though it remains to be seen if that’s his spot moving forward McCormick is ready for anything when it comes to the Steelers and whatever his role may be.

“I’m ready for whatever they throw at me” McCormick said to reporters on Day 1 of rookie minicamp according to video via Aaron Becker on Twitter. “I just wanna help the organization in any way that I can.”

They wanted us to be as versatile as possible and I think that’s something that can help all of us at the next level.” pic.twitter.com/4oZmz22TpB — Aaron Becker (@Aaron_M_Becker) May 10 2024

That’s largely been McCormick’s mindset since the Steelers drafted him in the fourth round at No. 119 overall.

Though he was primarily a left guard in college McCormick worked out for the Steelers as a center prior to the draft. Now he is getting work at right guard initially in the Black and Gold.

Having 3378 snaps at left guard seems like it would make for a difficult transition for McCormick to flip sides but that isn’t the case.

“At South Dakota State they prepared me for everything” McCormick said. “They wanted us to be as versatile as possible and I think that’s something that can help all of us at this level.”

It’s certainly going to help McCormick early on.

When the Steelers drafted him it made some sense that he could be the longtime answer at left or right guard with Isaac Seumalo turning 31 and James Daniels entering the final year of his contract as well as backup interior offensive lineman Nate Herbig entering the final year of his contract too.

McCormick’s versatility whether it’s at left guard center or right guard will be key. That should set him up for success long-term and will give Steelers offensive line coach Pat Meyer the ability to simply get the best five linemen on the field at once regardless of true position.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcmdhbmZoLm5ldC9vYml0dWFyeS9qb3NoLW1jY29ybWlja9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary | Josh McCormick of Huntington West Virginia,"LEWISBURG WV - Joshua Howard McCormick 38 of Huntington WV formerly of Lewisburg WV passed away May 3 2024 at home.

The reason behind this fast food design choice might surprise you.

Most people associate McDonald’s with its famous golden arches. So it’s no surprise that encountering a McDonald’s restaurant with a single arch has become an experience in its own right prompting others to document the occurrence on sites such as Twitter TikTok Instagram and Reddit.

Adidas shoppers rave about these extra-comfy sneakers with lots of cushion

These confirmed sightings of McDonald’s restaurants with one arch have sparked curiosity amongst McDonald’s stans and fast food connoisseurs wondering how these single arches came to be.

Looking back throughout McDonald’s history the answer is relatively simple: the future fast food giant was finding its brand identity.

According to an NBC News article in 1953 McDonald’s co-founders Richard and Maurice McDonald hired the architect Stanley Clark Meston to help create a functional design that popped for the first restaurant.

As NBC reports the website for McDonald’s USA states that Richard McDonald felt the roof line of the building was too flat and wanted to offset this with gold arches. During this period the arches were part of the building’s structural design with a single arch curving over and around each side of the building. Additionally a smaller matching arch held up the McDonald’s sign.

See this tiny New York apartment get an impressive redesign in one day with a $1000 budget:

The McDonald’s arches we know today became ingrained into the brand in 1962 when a registered trademark featuring the double-arched McDonald’s logo was introduced.

The number of McDonald’s restaurants with a single arch remains a mystery making it all the more exciting when coming across one.

According to McDonald’s USA these older locations have become popular destinations for road-trippers with a taste for nostalgia. In a statement to TODAReaction posts about this baffling sight can be spotted on TikTok Instagram and more.Y Food the fast food giant mentioned “We love seeing our fans celebrate our history at these nostalgic spots while also creating their own memories at McDonald’s in their local communities.”

Stone is best known for her role as Harper Finkle in the children’s TV show which ended back in 2012 alongside Selena Gomez.

She was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in 2013 and has been using the injectable InPen device for the past few years and is now a registered nurse in Los Angeles while also still working in acting.

“It can be daunting to be diagnosed with type 1 diabetes because it’s something you have to live with for the rest of your life and manage every single day” said Stone in a press release announcing the partnership ""to help others living with type 1 diabetes learn more about advanced technologies that can help make life with diabetes easier.""

“I remember feeling like no one truly understood what I was going through and I struggled for a while to learn what solutions worked best for my diabetes management. I didn’t want to give up the things I loved or dramatically change my routine. I’m thrilled I found the Medtronic InPen system: it fits seamlessly into my life and makes living with diabetes easier.”

Medtronic markets a host of Type 1 diabetes products including InPen as well as its MiniMed series of insulin pumps and the Guardian continual glucose monitoring system. The company is also working on new connected tech that couples these systems together.

Given the direct reference to InPen in Medtronic's campaign this goes beyond just an awareness campaign and into a fully branded promotion of the tech. There are pictures of Stone with the pen on Medtronic’s site though the tech company did not say whether there will be accompanying DTC ads.

There was a video on Medtronic’s official Facebook page of Stone talking about the new campaign though it has now been taken down.

“We’re excited to partner with Jennifer Stone to broaden awareness around the power of diabetes technology and the important role it can play in their life” said Que Dallara executive vice president and president of Medtronic Diabetes in the release.

As part of the InPen campaign Medtronic is also tapping non-celebrity patients who use the device including Mattie mom of two living with Type 1 diabetes and Laishia also living with Type 1 diabetes who gives glowing praise about InPen on its official product site.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGFydHJpYnVuZS5jb20vY2xhc3MtYWN0aW9uLXN1aXQtYWxsZWdlcy1zaGFyZWhvbGRlcnMtaHVydC1ieS1wcm9ibGVtcy13aXRoLW1lZHRyb25pY3MtZGlhYmV0ZXMtYnVzaW5lc3MvNjAwMjA1MzU3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Class-action suit alleges shareholders hurt by problems with Medtronic's diabetes business,"A new class-action lawsuit against Medtronic alleges that problems within the company's diabetes division hurt its stock price and in turn its shareholders.

The suit claims Medtronic misled investors about the health of its diabetes business and prospects for future approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the MiniMed 780G device its next-generation insulin pump.

Pennsylvania-based law firm Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check announced the litigation on Thursday.

""During the class period Medtronic repeatedly assured investors that the MiniMed 780G model was 'on track' for approval by the [FDA] and would provide Medtronic with the edge it needed to close a growing gap with its competitors in the diabetes market"" the firm said in its announcement.

The law firm is inviting anyone who bought Medtronic stock between June 8 2019 and May 25 2022 to join the suit.

Medtronic spokeswoman Erika Winkels said Friday the company had been made aware of the lawsuit but had not been served or reviewed the complaint.

Last December the company disclosed receiving a warning letter from the FDA outlining concerns about how the diabetes division had handled complaints assessed product risks and dealt with recalls.

The company lowered its financial guidance for the diabetes group that same day sending Medtronic's stock down 6%.

The warning letter also cast a pall of uncertainty over the FDA approval prospects for the MiniMed 780G.

In the company's most recent quarterly conference call with analysts last month Medtronic chief executive Geoff Martha said the company was close to resolving issues with the FDA.

""We're making good progress on our warning letter commitments"" Martha said ""We've completed more than 90% of the actions we committed to the FDA.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMDkvaGFydmFyZC1leHBlcnQtYmlsbC1nZW9yZ2UtaG93LXRvLWlkZW50aWZ5LWF2b2lkLXRveGljLWJvc3Nlcy5odG1s0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjIvMDkvMDkvaGFydmFyZC1leHBlcnQtYmlsbC1nZW9yZ2UtaG93LXRvLWlkZW50aWZ5LWF2b2lkLXRveGljLWJvc3Nlcy5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Harvard expert: The 5 types of bosses you never want to work for—or become,"No one wants to become a horrible boss let alone work for one — and a Harvard expert has a new guide for identifying and avoiding them. Bill George a senior fellow at Harvard Business School and former CEO of medical technology company Medtronic has spent almost 20 years studying leadership failures in the workplace. Bosses are inevitably doomed when they lose sight of their ""true north"" George tells CNBC Make It referring to their deeply held beliefs values and purpose as leaders. Those traits help guide people to make good decisions and lead effectively he explains: ""[They're] what makes you authentic and people naturally want to follow authentic leaders."" Losing your sight of your values has nothing to do with how smart you are George notes. It happens when you get distracted by extrinsic motivations like money fame and power — all at the expense of your moral compass. Last week George and co-author Zach Clayton published a new book ""True North: Leading Authentically in Today's Workplace Emerging Leader Edition."" The book identifies five different archetypes of bosses that you never want to become or work for because they've lost their ""true north"" in some way. Here's what they are and why George says those bosses are bound to fail:

1. Imposters

Imposters fight relentlessly to get to the top of organizations ""buying"" their spot with charm and appealing ideas George says. But once they get to the top they have no idea how to effectively lead because they lack a sense of self-awareness. These bosses don't have an accurate depiction of their own character actions or feelings — and they struggle to recognize how other people see them George says. That's a problem: Self-awareness helps bosses understand what's going right and wrong in their leadership. It shows them how their actions may be helping or hurting employees and what they can improve to lead them more effectively. Take WeWork founder and ex-CEO Adam Neumann as an example. Neumann won over investors with charm and charisma ultimately raising $10.4 billion from conglomerate holding company SoftBank. But he didn't have the self-awareness to effectively lead the company day-to-day George says. Instead Neumann's erratic management style harmed employees and his efforts to keep expanding the company with little planning led to WeWork's first failed attempt to go public in 2019 George says.

2. Rationalizers

Rationalizers always want to appear like they're always on top of everything they do George says. They're also ""masters of denial"" who are never willing to acknowledge and learn from their mistakes — instead rationalizing missteps and wrongdoing by blaming others. George's go-to example is Rajat Gupta the former managing partner of global consulting firm McKinsey. George even knows Gupta personally: They served together on three boards including Goldman Sachs in 2008. In 2012 Gupta was sentenced to two years in federal prison after sharing inside information about a $5 billion investment Warren Buffett made in Goldman to Raj Rajaratnam the founder of hedge fund management firm Galleon Group. Rajaratnam used that information to made insider trades generating $90 million in illicit profits. Gupta has since maintained his innocence blaming Rajaratnam for making him a ""victim"" in the scandal George says. The stance has hurt Gupta's ability to lead effectively since getting out of prison he adds: It's proof that he can't or won't learn from his mistakes.

3. Glory seekers

Glory seekers define their worth based on the amount of money they rake in how much positive press they get and how many prominent titles they can accumulate George says. They prioritize personal fame and fortune over building organizations with lasting value and are never truly satisfied with what they have he adds. George points to Greg Lindberg the founder of private equity firm Global Growth. Lindberg started with a successful strategy for acquiring broken businesses and growing their revenue. Ultimately that wasn't good enough for him — so he began acquiring insurance businesses with the goal of loaning their assets to other businesses he owned a process limited by laws in multiple states. In 2020 Lindberg was sentenced to more than seven years in prison for bribery and conspiracy to commit wire fraud after attempting to bribe North Carolina's insurance commissioner to bend those laws in his favor.

4. Loners

Loners — not to be confused with introverts — avoid forming close relationships and support networks says George. They think they can do everything on their own and often choose to reject feedback or advice they receive from employees board members and mentors. As a result they're prone to mistakes and setting their organizations up for failure George says. One example is Dick Fuld the former CEO of Lehman Brothers formerly the nation's fourth-largest investment bank. In 2008 Fuld's associates spent months warning him about the deep trouble his bank was in: It needed to recapitalize or essentially replace the debt it racked up with more capital according to George. The U.S. Treasury Secretary at the time Hank Paulson even weighed in with similar warnings. But Fuld was a loner who didn't listen to others so he failed to act George says. Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy later in 2008.

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL21lcmNrLXRyZWF0bWVudC10eXBlLXV0ZXJ1cy1jYW5jZXItZmFpbHMtdHJpYWwtMjAyNC0wNS0wOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', ConnectionResetError(10054, 'An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host', None, 10054, None)) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL21lcmNrLXRyZWF0bWVudC10eXBlLXV0ZXJ1cy1jYW5jZXItZmFpbHMtdHJpYWwtMjAyNC0wNS0wOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTbSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWFsdGguZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,"Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals Subscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.

Yuval Boger: Hello Thomas and thank you for joining me today.

Thomas Ehmer: Hi Yuval pleasure.

Yuval: So who are you and what do you do?

Thomas: That’s a good question Yuval and because I know the podcast I prepared a bit. I’m a bit of a superposition and it depends really on whom you ask. So for my band I’m the keyboard player for my kids I am the dad. But I think for this podcast I’ll tell you what I’m doing in my business. I’m one of the co-founders in the Merck group Merck KGaA. We are not Merck & Co. so there are two different independent companies. We have to tell this every time. So if you listen from the US we operate under EMD Serono. Rest of world we are Merck KGaA. And some eight years ago I was looking for novel technologies. I’m still looking for novel technologies and we did found a quantum task force with the objective to check if it makes sense that our company takes care of quantum technologies. It does. Yeah and then I’m a physicist by training. I look mainly at all applications that are novel to our company and should make sense. I’m a bit of a troublemaker because I bring technologies in-house that we don’t know yet how to use or we want to use but don’t have budget and so on. So that’s what I do for a living. Eight years

Yuval: wow.

Thomas: Yes.

Yuval: Really one of the pioneers. So let’s go back eight months. What have you learned in the last eight months about quantum and quantum readiness that maybe you didn’t know before that?

Thomas: Eight months is February. What did I learn in the last eight months? So I think what is confirming is that we have a very good emerging quantum computing community. I very much like all these conferences and it’s always good to see that we independent on whom you ask it seems that we are a community who wants to work together. Yeah and I think this is as some might say we approach quantum winter. We don’t know. But I think it’s good to see that there are still some brave people who carry the flag and work together. I see also that a lot of novel quantum computing architectures make it close to the market or are close to the market. So it’s really good to see. And I mean personally I was keen to see the recent announcement from Quantinuum for example where they have for example logical qubits apparently entangled. Eight years ago we didn’t even know how to build a single qubit. Now we have logical qubits at least in some claim that they have and I trust them. So this is interesting to see. And also the quantum communication part people are really getting keen on all these quantum key distribution communication protocols and so on. So that’s yeah. There’s not a single thing. I think it’s just really exploding. That’s good to see how far we move.

Yuval: In your company what do you see as the key application for quantum? Is it drug discovery or is it more things like optimization supply chain and so on?

Thomas: It depends on whom you ask. So we are super interested in quantum applications because once they come if ever they come they might be transformative. There’s so much hope and hype on drug discovery. Personally I’m not really a big fan or believer that computational drug discovery is outperforming wet drug discovery. So that’s my personal take. I think it’s a partnership and everybody’s betting on artificial intelligence. So drug discovery is a very complex thing and computational methods. Quantum computing is an additional computational method. So I think it’s a long way. There’s a very good paper out from the colleagues from Boehringer who did investigate if quantum computing ever will work. So it looks like we need new algorithms. So that’s my take. And the other problems logistics problems this is how it started for me actually to dive into quantum computing. So some years back the D-Wave were the first ones on the market with their traveling salesperson optimization. I still think it’s a miracle that we have these annealing things. And apparently so these ultra wicked complex problems might benefit also from quantum computing. I’m a bit undecided. I mean we see the three classes simulation optimization and machine learning. And yeah for our company none of them currently is relevant from an application perspective. But if they will come to maturity likely the material sciences is also of important.

Yuval: It’s very popular these days to talk about chat GPT moment a moment where AI moved from science fiction to we got to do it now. What do you think the quantum chat GPT or the quantum GPT moment is going to look like?

Thomas: The quantum that I have no clue. So I think the GPT moment was when everybody and their sister and brother were exposed to a functionality they could never imagine which is mimicking human intelligence. Actually it does not but it’s mimicking and it’s very convincing. So I think we will see how this develops compared to quantum. I have actually no clue. I could imagine that eventually something like this communication protocols might have an impact if everybody could just plug in whatever app to have a quantum secured point to point communication without any agency being able to listen in without me knowing they listen in. So this might be eventually one of these which has mass impact because I think quantum computing per se is rather an expert-ish niche co-processor thing. So I’m not sure how to. It’s a good question. I have to ask my guys what they think.

Yuval: You mentioned community earlier. And I know you’re part of a community of several I think German companies that work together to develop quantum. Could you tell me a little bit about that? And also related to that are you worried about other pharma companies about collaborating with other pharma companies to do quantum or right now a rising tide lifts all boats?

Thomas: Yes. So the yes is to the last question. So the company you mentioned at the beginning so it’s an association called QUTAC stands for German Quantum Technology Application Consortium. We have a very cool homepage. And it’s an association of the 13 big German companies. I don’t want to mention them all because otherwise the podcast would be over. What we are doing we organize ourselves in several streams and with the focus to identify quantum technology use cases that we could work on either as developers or co-developers or application user guidance for the developers. Independent from our own let’s say business. For example we work together with automotive or pharma and reinsurers logistics companies on let’s say logistics problems. Everybody has their problems and we test out different approaches on knapsack etc. So that’s one thing. And the other thing is we share the burden to evaluate vendors potential service providers. And by being attractive enough if as a partner you manage to convince QUTAC you not only have one customer but you would have 13 customers. So that’s the main point. And also I think it’s very helpful. All of us have relatively small quantum teams. So these are big worldwide corporations. I mean BMW SAP Bühringer etc. And all have relatively small quantum teams. And it’s very comfortable for us as a team to not be alone so that we have a bit of a peers and we can share interests. Regarding the pharma guys I mean it started I think at the Q2B several years back. There was an initiative that we all say everybody claims we can speed up drug discovery or drug development or we can bring better drugs to the world by quantum computing. Who knows how this works? Nobody did. So it’s also very open very collaborative. And I think it’s rather a friend-ish approach bosonic approach that we work together instead of competition because currently it’s really pre-competitive. There’s also the Pistoia Alliance who is setting up one pharma consortium thing. There are several pharma consortiums emerging. So that’s quite open. And the third part I forgot. Now I think you answered everything here.

Yuval: When you think about QUTAC what is the issue that you’re facing right now? What is the key thing that you’re looking for a solution?

Thomas: So we have different streams. So one stream we started focusing on the logistics and the material sciences streams. It looks like currently we have reshuffled a bit. So one part of us is looking at generative components. So we’re working on quantum generative network so QGANs to check in how far they perform better than classical GANs. We have a paper out. You can make sense yourself if it’s worthwhile or not. I mean it’s early days but this is where we jointly work on because everybody is interested of course in these generative networks. The other thing is in the logistics part we work on knapsack problems to understand can quantum do better knapsack things. And there’s another stream which is composed of different people. They work mainly on material science topics so quantum chemistry using quantum computers. I don’t have too much insight in that but it’s always shared problems that we say how can you better do ground energy finding whatever. What is quantum Monte Carlo? Where does it make sense? Where does it not make sense? And the third stream I mentioned is really looking at infrastructure from different perspectives. So we are also writing there some papers with the target audience of being other quantum computing users to guide them if it makes sense to go on neutral atoms. I mean you know neutral atoms or we’re just working on an ion trap paper. And the other part is also political communication. And in principle also we wanted to do a bit of education so help grow talent for our companies. But that’s not so far progressed as we would have wanted just due to the lack of resource we have.

Yuval: You mentioned the comparison between computational chemistry or using quantum computing for computational chemistry versus wet labs. In a company like Merck how much communication is there between the people who are actually working on developing drugs and people like yourself who are dealing with future technologies?

Thomas: That’s a good question. So I think there is enough communication. There is even a common ground. There are just not enough solutions. I mean we have recently discussed the potential to do I don’t know what was this the idea to use quantum computer annealing approaches to find binding pockets in complex targets. And when I talk to our researchers who do the wet stuff or other computational stuff they said it sounds interesting. On the other hand we already have 15 methods or 20 methods and I have 15 people so I just don’t have capacity to digest this. So I think there is an appetite that it’s really tough to understand this added value given that you have new ways of thinking. So quantum algorithm is using quantum features nobody really understands what these are even the quantum guys don’t. And then I mean how to translate your existing problems in a way that you can make additional value for using quantum components or quantum core processor. That’s not easy. And unfortunately most have objectives that are not so much forward looking and have time to think what will be happening in 10 5 years because in the end you need to deliver the next target. And it’s just a bit of operational pressure. I mean it’s a bit of a dance and mainly of interest so people listening with interest but it’s just currently it’s more playful with the intent to detect good things but it’s not a threat currently if we would not look at it I think.

Yuval: Do you see a need for a company like Merck to purchase a quantum computer anytime soon in the next few years or everything is on the cloud as far as you’re concerned?

Thomas: I mean there are different answers to that. I think it depends on what you want to achieve so if we want to contribute as a material supplier for example because we have the very best isotopes and the very best gas to do nitrogen vacancy whatever stuff well so do we need a quantum computer for that? Maybe not. If we want to learn to program it there are so many solutions out in the cloud. I doubt that we need one in-house. And then there’s on the other hand the approach that the American clinics currently are doing. So every clinic who thinks they have interest in novel technologies they put a quantum computer on site which is then I think rather a symbol because if every day you pass a quantum computer eventually it triggers your way of thinking what could I do with it? So I think for this sake more as a symbol it could make sense. And I mean it looks good. The machines depending on which machines you use but I think definitely from a productive use point it doesn’t make sense this moment in time. I would not even know whom to hire to maintain and operate these things because they are very fragile and you need to calibrate all these. And then the question is also which technology do you want to have? So you would need to buy one of each flavors modalities how they’re called. I would not know what to choose. So therefore I think it’s also not from a financial investment. Maybe it’s not a good value investment because the next generation makes the other one obsolete. So it’s not that it’s getting more and more from a collector’s viewpoint that you can collect. I have the very first I don’t know a QuEra machine and then I put it somewhere. I have the very first IBM machine with 127 qubits. I think it doesn’t make sense.

Yuval: Germany is one of the countries that’s investing heavily in quantum on the national level. And do you feel some of the results of this investment or do you think it’s going to be years out?

Thomas: So personally I feel some of it because I’m also profiting from a federal funded project which I’m very grateful for because otherwise we would not do this project because it’s just too risky. And because we have this funding I can spend part of my time to think on things I would not think for. And the interesting part is that I think we heard this on several talks also on conferences that because you think on quantum algorithms you detect sometimes solutions that are completely independent from quantum that help your business nevertheless. So that’s one aspect. Do I see other… I mean Germany spends a lot of money. The UK does France does. Others do too. I can’t really say that I have seen quick returns but I see that there is a lot of attention and even a bit of understanding in the decision makers. It’s moving into a direction which is at least they want to understand what it is and it’s quite complex but I think it’s more technology friendly these days than it was in the past. Unfortunately we have the situation in the world. So I think everywhere funds are cut for fundamental research. But I mean that’s I think independent from the aim that we want to spend much money on that. I mean one thing on the other hand is what I find a bit disappointing is that we have a bit of this fragmentation in Germany. We have all the land and everybody wants to do their own valley. So we have a quantum valley in Munich we have a Saxony valley. So in Germany everybody is a bit of building their own center and everybody is in the center of their world. I’m not sure how this is in other countries. I think France is by definition different that everything goes to Paris and then you have to see what’s coming out there. But the original question is yes I think it makes sense. You slowly see. I think we’re a bit far behind. Others started earlier and have more mature startup scenes but we’re catching up.

Yuval: You spoke earlier about the quantum winter and also mentioned that you’ve been doing this for eight years. Do you think there is a risk that a company like Merck says you know what we’ve been at this for a while. Let’s shelve it and come back in three years and maybe things will be different.

Thomas: I think there is in principle the risk because we are not doing this as a profession. Everybody’s doing this as their hobby. We have a very small team under our digital just forget but we have a central function and we have a digital unit. And somewhere in this area we have a unit who is doing quantum and AI lab. And these are not many people. And they spend a very small part of the time doing what they do. And what I’m doing thanks to my boss and my boss’s boss and everything so I am doing this on top of my job. I have zero budget except the federal funding so there is not much to cut. Because otherwise it’s late in the evening we have this call after business hours. So I think many people are committed despite not having money because it’s not like in other companies where you have a really a small team and hire a few students. For us it’s relatively small. And I rather see that we are doing more than is visible to the top management. And when we did this task force people were surprised how active we are. If you’re not in the field of course you don’t see it. But then when you say we should do something about quantum computing you see that we’re relatively well networked. I think that’s… Does this answer the question?

Yuval: Absolutely. So hypothetically if you could have dinner with one of the quantum greats dead or alive who would that person be?

Thomas: I’m prepared so I’m not so… I don’t fake surprise. And it took me a long time to think. And I’m in a very lucky position that I already had lunch with some of my idols they’re alive. Therefore I go for the dead ones. And this is a tough thing. I think I would go for David Bohm or John Wheeler because I really like the way they put more into quantum which has to do with consciousness research self-perception the miracles of the observer what is the observer so the bigger picture. Currently I’m tending in my philosophical interpretation of the word a bit to the monistic view which is maybe a bit over-exaggerated. But the miracle that we have something which is self-perception and we have something which is an external world. And how come? We don’t know. And there are so many different interpretations and I think Bohm did a very good… with his implicate order he had a very good idea to think about that we need new ways of expressing ourselves if I understood this correct. And I’ve seen some rare interviews back on YouTube with him and he seems to be a very super interesting person. But he’s dead unfortunately so no chance.

Yuval: Very well. Thomas thank you so much for joining me today.

A simple price performance comparison shows that MATANA had the upper hand in one year. Further on average analysts see a higher upside in MATANA stocks. However investing is not about buying fancy acronyms. According to TipRanks’ data-driven Smart Score only Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the MATANA list have a higher potential to outperform the market.

But before we dig deeper let’s examine why FAANG needed an upgrade.

Why the Rebranding?

For years FAANG stocks - Meta (previously Facebook) (NASDAQ:META) Apple Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (earlier Google) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) – symbolized big tech companies.

However Wang in a video interview with Yahoo Finance Live suggested dropping Meta and Netflix from the big tech list and advised adding Microsoft Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to the group. Together these stocks are now known as MATANA.

The move follows the underperformance of FAANG stocks in 2022. Blame the base effect for the slowdown in their growth or investors losing appetite for risk amid fears of an economic slowdown FAANG stocks have lost their sheen.

Specifically Meta Platforms and Netflix are struggling to stay relevant to their consumers amid their changing preferences in the post-pandemic world and heightened competition.

FAANG or MATANA: Which Is the Better Tech Play?

Built with TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool here is a summary of how FAANG stocks performed in the past year and what analysts recommend.

The graph below shows that FAANG stocks on average are down over 34% in the past one year. Meanwhile analysts’ average price target reflects an upside potential of over 25% in one year.

The Stock Comparison tool shows that a portfolio of MATANA stocks have performed better than FAANG stocks in the past one year. For context MATANA stocks on average are down about 2.2% during the comparable period significantly outperforming FAANG stocks.

Further analysts’ average price target shows an upside of over 28% in the next 12 months.

Bottom Line

MATANA is slightly more diversified than FAANG. However this shouldn’t matter much as the broader industry classification is the same with these stocks being prone to similar risks.

Furthermore the above graph shows that only Microsoft and Apple stock sport an Outperform Smart Score on TipRanks in the MATANA list. Meanwhile hedge funds are also bullish on only these two stocks.

All in all investors should focus on diversifying their portfolio with Top Smart Score Stocks across multiple sectors to lower risk and maximize gains.

Faced with a slumping share price and shrinking profits the tech giant has begun to cut costs—a move that has resulted in the termination of a group that policed ethical problems relating to the company’s social media platforms.

The Wall Street Journal reported this week that Meta had disbanded its Responsible Innovation (RI) team a group tasked with addressing potential ethical concerns about its products which include Facebook Instagram and WhatsApp.

During its tenure as a public company Meta—formerly known as Facebook—has been plagued with ethical blunders from damning exposés on its handling of user data to reports on its struggle to manage toxic content’s impact on teenagers’ mental health.

A spokesperson for Meta was not available for comment when contacted by Fortune but the company told the WSJ that it remained committed to the RI team’s objectives.

A Meta representative said that while most of the RI team—which consisted of around two dozen workers including engineers and ethics experts—would be reassigned to other roles not all of the former members were guaranteed new jobs at Meta.

Last year Margaret Stewart a vice president at the company who established the RI team in 2018 said in a blog post titled “Why I’m optimistic about Facebook’s Responsible Innovation efforts” that the group existed to “help teams at Facebook proactively surface and address potential harms to society in all that we build.”

It worked with third-party privacy specialists users and academics to identify and handle potential ethical problems with new products and updates to its existing products and social media platforms.

Tightening belts

The cutting of the Responsible Innovation team comes as Meta like many other tech companies seeks to rein in costs.

In July after Meta reported its first revenue decline since going public a decade ago CEO Zuckerberg said teams in the company’s workforce were “going to shrink” and that he expected the firm would soon have to “get more done with fewer resources.”

To do this the company is launching a year-long support program for 150 innovative and promising creators across the world. 10 creators from sub-Saharan Africa (East Africa South Africa and Francophone West Africa) made this global list.

According to Meta the selected Africans are breaking out from their online communities and championing key creator territories from art music beauty business dance well-being and fashion. They will join other creators from countries including France Spain Italy Germany and the United Kingdom to further grow their audiences on Meta platforms and reimagine how tools such as Reels can be used.

The social media industry is seeing an astronomical rise in creator numbers globally and competitor firms are giving the Zuckerberg-owned company a run for its money. For example TikTok a Chinese social app recorded a massive growth rate in Q2 2022 amidst Facebook’s declining revenue and growth.

Also within the past few months Instagram has received strong criticism for replicating BeReal’s community photo-sharing style and TikTok’s algorithm and framing. Thousands of Instagram users including the Kardashians vehemently opposed Instagram’s move in July forcing the social media company to revert its updates and “stay true to itself.”

With the launch of the Creators of Tomorrow initiative Meta is seeking to consolidate itself as the true powerhouse for digital content and its creators. The social media giant handpicked creators who according to them can lead the new frontiers of digital content and pull global interests towards their Meta-powered platforms which would later include the metaverse.

The 10 selected creators are Uganda’s Nadia Matovu South Africa’s Pamela Mtanga Kenya’s Kennar and Kwambox Zambia’s Ruth Ronnie Senegal’s Ngorbatchev Niang and Fatou Toure Zimbabwe’s Hannah Hapaguti and Cote d Ivoire’s Sarai D’Hologne and Mishaa.

“The 10 diverse creators selected are at the forefront of their communities and industries leading the charge in how they approach storytelling interactive entertainment video formats and technology” Meta said in a web post.

L-R Kwambox and Kennar

Moon Baz Creator Partnerships Lead Middle East Africa and Turkey Meta said: “With this campaign we aim to highlight creators who are innovating through tools such as Reels and short-form video content formats as well as those who are leveraging exploring new content formats such as AR/VR. We are excited to work closely with these creators and we’re committed to helping them grow their audience build a business and unlock new possibilities for the future as we build for the metaverse.”

Though Meta says it will help these creators expand their audiences and “turn their passions into professions” some experts suspect Meta’s move is primarily geared towards creating a global audience for its metaverse plans. Whatever the case is one thing is for sure: Meta’s decision to work directly with 150 global creators and improve their work has got the world watching so if things go well for Meta more people may be attracted to its platforms.

Facebook’s fall from grace has been swift so it makes sense that Meta would want to emphasize Instagram more heavily because of the fact that this is the sort of thing that could potentially end up making up for the losses that Facebook is bringing in.One method that people use to boost engagement on their Instagram posts is to use hashtags but with all of that having been said and now out of the way it is important to note that (time after time) Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri has admitted that doing so might not be all that effective. According to Mosseri hashtags are not actually meant to boost engagement but rather they are meant to help sort content into categories so that people can look through them a bit more easily with all things having been considered and taken into account.Since what Mosseri is saying goes against what people have been assuming about hashtags for quite a long time researchers at SocialInsider conducted a study in which they looked over tens of millions of Instagram posts or 75 million to be precise. These posts were published over a period of one year between March of 2021 and March of 2022. It turns out that this research has confirmed Mosseri’s assertions that hashtags do not in fact help people get even slightly more traction on their social media posts despite assumptions to the contrary.However an important fact that needs to be considered is that hashtags can still improve post performance slightly but overloading one’s post with hashtags will not increase its reach in an exponential way although some might logically assume that that’s the case. Using three to four hashtags resulted in the highest boost in engagement of around 3.41% but in spite of the fact that this is the case most other hashtag quantities produced only marginally less optimal results which indicates that hashtags are not essential to make sure that your post gets good reach.SocialInsider also cross referenced this research by analyzing Instagram accounts with various follower counts. No matter how many followers an account has using too many hashtags almost always results in decreased engagement rather than higher engagement levels and reach. This becomes even more prominent for bigger accounts who have between fifty thousand to one million followers. Big accounts generally see the best performance when they use three to four hashtags but for small to medium sized accounts this ideal number hovers at around five to six so they have more leeway in that regard.Instead of flooding your Instagram posts with hashtags it would be better to use fewer hashtags and focus on using the right ones. Some hashtags can result in better reach than others because they are searched for more frequently or alternatively they might be a bit more relevant to the content that you are creating. Quantity is definitely not equal to quality in most aspects of finding an audience and hashtags are yet another example of that.Read next: 82% of Social Media Users Go to Meta Platforms for Online Shopping

This performance was initially scheduled for September 10 2020 but had been postponed two years in a row due to COVID-19.

The evening was an absolute downpour as tens of thousands of fans filled into one of the largest NFL stadiums in the country. While not overly cold it was definitely a wet experience that fortunately slowed down as it got closer to showtime.

One cannot talk about Rammstein without mentioning their stage presence. Over the years the band has had it fair share of controversy with the different “acts” they have performed on stage and of course the sheer amount of fire and pyrotechnics they bring. This stadium show Rammstein has now magnifies anything they have previously done ten-fold. The stage itself cost over 6 million dollars and takes four days to assemble. With massive towers to accompany the stage that fill the inside of the stadium resemble fire coming off an oil rig walking into the stadium to this was truly a sight to behold.

At approximately 8pm the lights went dark and the crowd erupted in anticipation as a massive explosion on stage began Rammstein’s epic performance. Opening up the set with “Armee der Tristen” the band members make their way on stage from an elevator platform underneath that brought them up.

Rammstein performed a massive 21 song set that included a good mix of their new material as well as fan favorites. During the performance of “Puppe” a large baby carriage is brought onto the stage and burned while video shows a demonic baby doll spewing insects from its mouth. This is all capped off by confetti cannons shooting black confetti all over the crowd which really brought this scene to life.

For the acoustic performance of “Engel” the band jumped into inflatable pontoon boats and surfed their way to a smaller stage in the middle of the crowd. Returning the main stage the band went right back into their industrial-heavy “Auslander” which had the audience singing along.

The entire performance was nonstop fire explosions and mayhem. The climax of all of this was during the band’s second encore performance of “Rammstein” in which Lindermann wears a pyro backpack that shoots out a barrage of fireballs around him while singing as well as the stage erupting in flames as well as the towers throughout the stadium.

This Rammstein show is one of their greatest live shows to date with nonstop fire explosions fireworks and flamethrowers. There was even a cannon that came out which Lindermann mounted and sprayed the crowd in foam. It’s easy to make the comparison that you could be smack dab in the middle of Mordor while all of this is happening and truly a show where words just can’t do it justice.

Including his own.

Saleh's New York Jets will open the NFL regular season against the Baltimore Ravens at home — just across the Hudson River from where hijackers crashed two planes into the World Trade Center during the 9/11 attacks.

Football will be played Sunday but all the cheers won't mean anyone has forgotten. Certainly not Saleh whose oldest brother David narrowly escaped the south tower that day.

There were 2750 others in lower Manhattan who never went home.

And chances are many of the fans rooting for the Jets — in the stands and at home — to beat Lamar Jackson and the Ravens on Sunday have been mourning personal losses since that day.

“There’s no doubt. It’s amplified because it is 9/11 in this city” Robert Saleh said. “Not so much for me but for the people who are in the thick of it. Obviously I know it’s documented about my brother but I heard stories this week about the cars being at (the Meadowlands) for months afterward because no one could pick them up. And then the Long Island train stations and the tragedies that led up to this.”

Saleh was only 22 on Sept. 11 2001 and just starting out in the financial business in Detroit. His brother was training as a financial adviser in New York City.

As Saleh and his family watched on TV as the attacks unfolded there Washington D.C. and Shanksville Pennsylvania they prayed hoped and begged for David to be OK.

Several agonizing hours later David called.

He made it.

Robert who thought he lost his big brother immediately began contemplating his own life and career path. After a few more months trudging through the financial world the former college tight end knew he needed to chase his dream.

He wanted to be a coach.

That two-decade journey began at Michigan State and brought him to Central Michigan Georgia the Houston Texans Seattle Seahawks Jacksonville Jaguars and San Francisco 49ers before he became an NFL head coach for the first time last year with the Jets.

“I’m supposed to be here and I believe that God does things for a reason” Saleh said after he was hired. “And I believe this is one of them.”

His debut with the Jets last year — Sept. 12 at Carolina — coincided with the 20th anniversary of the terrorist attacks.

This year he'll be standing on the sideline in a stadium filled with fans predominantly from the New York/New Jersey area exactly 21 years since that day.

“I think it’s very personal for a lot of people and I think that passion is felt country-wide not just in New York” Saleh said Friday. “But it’s a little bit more important here and you know that (Sunday) means a lot more than just a football game to a lot of people in the stands.

""That’s why I think that’s what's going to make Sunday pretty cool.”

Sports became a method of healing and a source of unity when they returned to stadiums across the country a few weeks after the attacks.

And they have continued to do so in the years since particularly during the days surrounding the anniversary. That's something not lost on Ravens coach John Harbaugh.

“We’re going up to New York going to be in the Meadowlands it’s going to be 9/11” Harbaugh said. “It’s a great honor to be chosen to go up there and play on 9/11. We take it very seriously that part of it.

""We know the environment we know how loud it’s going to be we know how enthusiastic they’re going to be their demeanor. They’re going to be into it. We have to match that as best we can.”

There will be poignant moments of silence before the game.

And very likely some tears.

A 100-yard American flag will be unfurled on the field by members of the New York Police Department New York City Fire Department and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police Department.

The Jets will then begin a new game day tradition by having fans sing the national anthem. It will be led by NYPD officer Brianna Fernandez whose late father Luis was a 23-year veteran of the NYPD who helped in the rescue and recovery efforts.

A stadium again will be filled with voices united by tragedy and bonded by football.

“I know y’all like to tailgate. I would appreciate it if you all get out there early get in there early” Saleh said directing his message to the fans. “I would love if everyone sang the national anthem. Don’t just listen to it just sing it.

""I think it’s the coolest thing when the stadium sings it. I think it’s going to be electric.”

Target date funds were first introduced in the early 1990s and have been growing in popularity ever since. By year-end 2018 according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI) target date fund assets represented approximately 27% of total 401(k) assets in their database. The appeal is understandable. Many 401(k) plan participants are not very knowledgeable concerning investment selection so a cost-effective professionally managed allocation offers an alternative.

Per a 2022 Stable Value Study by Metlife 89% of plan sponsors and 97% of plan advisors indicated that they would be interested if a target fund provider could offer a solution “that generates net returns four times more than the cost associated with delivering those incremental returns (e.g. 60 basis points enhanced net returns for a cost of 15 basis points) while keeping volatility constant.”

Stable value funds may have the potential to offer this kind of tradeoff under the right circumstances; however that asset class is generally not found in current off-the-shelf target date funds due to Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) constraints. This is why many advisors might consider solutions such as pre-set allocation models using a stable value fund already available in the plan’s general lineup or alternatively a set of customized target date collective investment trusts (CITs) with stable value as a key holding.

Academic literature supports this development. In “Stable Value Funds Performance” Babbel and Herce performed efficient frontier analysis which is a lynchpin of Modern Portfolio Theory and made the case that stable value should be a significant component of any efficient frontier where it is an available asset class. Specifically the authors concluded that stable value tends to dominate both bonds and cash which are the common diversifying assets currently used by traditional target date funds.

The efficient frontier is defined as the set of optimal portfolios that offers the highest expected return for each level of assumed standard deviation. Portfolios that are constructed to be on the efficient frontier curve are said to be optimal while portfolios that fall below the efficient frontier are said to be non-efficient or sub-optimal. To construct an efficient frontier an advisor needs three pieces of data for every potential asset class: expected return expected standard deviation and the expected correlation of asset classes versus each other. Overall the best individual asset class components tend to be those with high returns relative to their standard deviation while also being less correlated to other asset classes.

Source: http://www.ci.com/advisingtheclient/sbuild/sbuild_11.html

In 2018 Babbel and Herce also concluded that the stable value asset class was “dominant” because it offered enviable returns with low standard deviation. To see if those findings still hold true today we analyzed the returns and standard deviation for bonds money market and stable value for the past 15 years below:

Annualized Return (1/1/2007 through 12/31/2021) Standard Deviation (1/1/2007 through 12/31/2021) Core Bonds 3.98% 3.60% Money Market 0.72% 0.38% Stable Value 2.56% 0.28%

Source: Morningstar Direct Category Performance 2022. Core Bonds = US Fund Intermediate Core Bond Money Market = US Fund Money Market – Taxable Stable Value = Morningstar US CIT Stable Value GR

At first glance the results above might appear too good to be true. How are stable value providers able to consistently outperform money market funds with comparable standard deviation? The secret is in the issuers’ skill in underwriting participant behavior. For example while an individual participant may buy and sell their investment at any time issuers know that collectively a total plan will usually have relatively stable cash flows into the investment overall. As a result the stable value issuer can then invest in longer-duration higher-yielding assets benefiting all participants for whatever amount of time that they individually invest in the fund.

The Investment Company Institute estimates that stable value funds currently make up roughly $900 billion of the overall $7 trillion in defined contribution plan assets. Yet stable value as an investment does not seem to be fully appreciated by the typical investor. This is likely because use of the asset class is limited to tax-qualified vehicles such as Defined Contribution plans. The inability of Wall Street to sell stable value directly to retail investors is a likely factor for limited national marketing exposure of this asset class.

The Stable Value Fund Industry has been around since the 1970s and has regularly outperformed money market funds since that time. However it does come with a few constraints. First a plan is generally required to avoid other competing investments such as money market and short-term bond funds. Second a plan needs to make a long-term commitment to the asset class since removing the asset from the plan lineup entirely can require advance notice or potentially trigger a market value adjustment. Both constraints are necessary to provide the issuer with cash flow stability needed for investment in longer duration assets.

It should be noted that there is additional potential issuer risk that is not fully captured by the efficient frontier modeling however on the positive side the Stable Value Fund Industry has already been stress tested by many significant global events—1970s inflation 1990s tech boom and subsequent crash the Great Financial Crisis and the recent pandemic—all without major incident thus far. Still it should be noted that past performance is not an indicator of future results.

Stable value already occupies a significant portion of the overall retirement plan industry assets approximately 10% of the total defined contribution market[1] despite limited marketing to the public and nascent use in preset allocations and customized target date collective investment trusts. As more advisors and plan sponsors become aware of these alternatives to traditional target date funds stable value funds are strongly positioned for consideration in diversified portfolios.

The tunable laser market covers the following areas:

Tunable Laser Market - Market Dynamics

Major Driver -

The key factor driving growth in the tunable laser market is the growth in the adoption of nanotechnology across sectors.

Technological advances in the healthcare sector have increased the demand for sophistication. Therefore vendors that specialize in providing technological instruments and machinery are investing mainly in the development of diagnostic systems that use nanotechnology.

The integration of nanotechnology in the healthcare sector would significantly help in speeding up the entire diagnostic process thereby complementing the primary goal of diagnostics to identify a medical problem in the shortest time. Governments and technology firms are investing in the development of nanotechnology because of its wide applications in areas like electronics biomaterials microfabrication and medicine. Thus it is anticipated that nanotechnology will be one of the major end-user segments of tunable lasers and in turn will drive the market in focus.

Major Challenges -

The availability of substitutes for tunable lasers will be a major challenge for the tunable laser market during the forecast period.

Many market participants prefer to use traditional lasers such as zirconia mercury and paramagnetic analyzers instead of tunable lasers. Zirconia-based traditional lasers are highly preferred for measurements of parts per million (ppm) to % levels of oxygen (O2) in a gas or mixture of gases.

Other prominent substitutes for tunable lasers are paramagnetic analyzers. Since O2 is a paramagnetic gas it gets attracted to the magnetic field in the analyzer which generates a signal to the feedback system within the analyzer. Since these alternatives cost significantly less compared with tunable lasers many small-scale manufacturing plants and industries that are not capable of making a high capital investment are integrating other types of traditional lasers instead of tunable lasers. This is expected to limit the adoption of tunable lasers.

Some big name changes are ahead for properties on the Strip but it’s not happening right away.

The executive team for Providence Rhode Island-based Bally’s Corp. previewed what’s in store for the Tropicana Las Vegas in a two-hour licensing hearing Wednesday before the Nevada Gaming Control Board.

The 65-year-old 1467-room resort at the southeast corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Tropicana Avenue is destined for a management change if the Nevada Gaming Commission follows the Control Board’s licensing recommendation when it meets Sept. 22.

What could transpire is a musical-chairs transition of Strip hotel names.

Bally’s which isn’t affiliated with the Bally’s casino-resort on the Strip is destined to take over operations at the Trop from Penn Entertainment Inc. a Pennsylvania company that also runs the M Resort at the far southern end of Las Vegas Boulevard.

Bally’s has a history of attaching its name to the location of its resorts. There’s Bally’s Atlantic City Bally’s Lake Tahoe Bally’s Kansas City and soon Bally’s Chicago since it submitted the winning proposal for the Windy City’s first and only casino.

Horseshoe brand

Meanwhile the hotel currently known as Bally’s — and it used to be the MGM Grand before today’s MGM Grand was built across the street from the Tropicana — is destined for its own name change.

Caesars Entertainment Inc. owns the resort Bally’s and agreed to dust off one of its brands — Horseshoe — and put that name on the building. The Bally’s signage is already coming off the building.

Las Vegas long-timers know that there used to be a Horseshoe in downtown Las Vegas.

What is now Binion’s on Fremont Street was once Binion’s Horseshoe until 2005. Founded in 1951 by Benny Binion it’s now owned by Terry Caudill’s TLC Casino Enterprises the same company that owns Four Queens.

There’s a certain symmetry surrounding Horseshoe.

When Binion owned it the casino was known as “the place that made poker famous.” When Caesars acquired the Horseshoe brand and the famed World Series of Poker it decided to move the 101-event poker tournament from the Rio to Bally’s or the soon-to-be-named Horseshoe.

A’s still in play

In testimony from last week’s Control Board hearing Bally’s executives Lee Fenton and George Papanier said there are big plans ahead for the Tropicana but it hasn’t reached any final decisions.

Papanier who heads Bally’s retail operations said the company generally takes several months to develop a plan for the future. As for the Tropicana it hasn’t been determined whether the company will do a few nips and tucks or whether it will be a complete redevelopment overhaul.

One of the topics that often comes up regarding the Tropicana is the role it could play in luring Major League Baseball’s Oakland A’s to Southern Nevada.

The Trop was one of the early sites the A’s had their eyes on when they first began investigating Las Vegas as a potential relocation destination.

Because Fenton and Papanier didn’t say anything about baseball during the Control Board hearing I asked Papanier if the Trop was still in play as a potential stadium site.

“A lot of this information is already public and we certainly are in discussions with the A’s organization” Papanier said.

“They (the A’s) have other opportunities as well a couple of other sites they’re considering in the market as well as ultimately having to make a decision on Oakland” he said. “They’re continuing to engage with us and hopefully there will be an opportunity where we could do a joint development.”

Papanier said the lengthy process of determining what’s ahead for the Trop has nothing to do with the A’s stadium timeline. He also reiterated that for the immediate future the Tropicana name will stick.

“Under the current version of the Tropicana property it will stay Tropicana” he said. “Ultimately when we go through that evaluation period and determine what we’re going to do futuristically and ultimately redevelop the property that’s when we’ll carry the Bally brand.”

The A’s who also have been negotiating for a potential stadium site with Treasure Island owner Phil Ruffin who owns the 37-acre Las Vegas Festival Grounds at Las Vegas Boulevard and Sahara Avenue say they don’t plan to make a public statement about the stadium until they’ve chosen a site.

Hardly a picture of an ailing economy at least as it pertains to gaming. The outlier was Illinois flat with 2019 ($117 million) but up 9% from last year. Customers attended much more (10%) and spent slightly less (-1%). Traditional market leader Rivers Casino Des Plaines booked $48 million a 17% surge while rebranding continues to benefit Bally’s Quad Cities vaulting 26% to $4.5 million. Hard Rock Rockford also came in at $4.5 million while Par-A-Dice climbed 3.5% to $5 million.

It wasn’t a good month for the biggest chains though. Penn Entertainment‘s Argosy Alton was down 8% to $3 million its Hollywood Aurora slid 11% to $8 million but Hollywood Joliet grew 5% to $7.5 million. Harrah’s Metropolis slipped 6% to $5 million Harrah’s Joliet tumbled 10% to $12 million and Grand Victoria slipped 5% to $13 million. DraftKings Casino Queen dipped 1.5% to $7 million to round out the picture.

Next door in Iowa gambling win nosed up 1% still 14.5% higher than 2019. Unlike Illinois visitation was down (-3%) but spending was up (4%). The statewide gross was $147 million. Racinos did best with Prairie Meadows grossing $20 million an 11% leap and Horseshoe Bluffs Run Park cantering in with $18 million up 1%. The coffee achiever among pure casino plays was Ameristar Council Bluffs bringing Penn $15.5 million for a 6% gain. Others within shouting distance were Riverside Casino & Golf Resort ($11 million +4%) Rhythm City ($9 million -6%) Diamond Jo Worth ($8.5 million -1%) and Isle Waterloo ($8 million flat) followed by a whole lotta also-rans.

Logging its biggest August ever Ohio raked in $196 million incrementally above last year but 19% higher than three years previous. Continuing to defy convention wisdom table-less MGM Northfield Park continued to lead the Buckeye State with $24 million (+4%). Its nearest competitor was Hollywood Columbus up 5% to $22 million. Jack Cleveland was flat just below $22 million while hard-charging Hard Rock Cincinnati banked $21 million up 6%. Hollywood Toledo slipped 2% to $19 million. It was passed by Scioto Downs flat but good for $2o million. Other tracks on the upswiwng included Miami Valley Gaming up 6.5% to $19 million … and nobody else. Jack Thistledown slid 7.5% to $16 million Belterra Park was down 5.5% to $8 million and Hollywood Dayton ($12 million) and Hollywood Mahoning Valley ($13 million) dipped 2.5% and 3% respectively.

Before we leave Ohio it should be noted that the first eight conditional sports-betting licenses have been awarded with Jacks Cleveland and Thistledown at the head of the queue. Others approved are the Cleveland Browns the Columbus Crew the Cincinnati Reds the Muirfield Village Golf Club Hollywood Toledo and Hollywood Mahoning Valley. That leaves 32 brick-and-mortar and 17 online books to be green-lit by January 1. The state will also be flooded with betting kiosks with 819 retailers vying for 499 (!) locations. 41 Kroger stores have already been approved. We’ve never seen a state go as all-in with sports betting as Ohio.

Maryland outdid even Ohio with $169.5 million. (Flat vs. 2021 but 10% over 2019.) MGM National Harbor led the small pack with $72 million up 6.5% pursued by Maryland Live’s $57 million (-4.5%). Horseshoe Baltimore was a miserable $17 million (-4%). Hollywood Perryville also suffered stumbling 7.5% to $7 million. Ocean Downs leapt 7% to $10.5 million but Rocky Gap Resort slipped 2% to $6 million.

Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot (D) is up to her old tricks. She’s created a Casino Community Advisory Council of 15 “issue experts” and four “neighborhood representatives” to advise on Bally’s Chicago. The last time Lightfoot went through a charade like this she bypassed her advisory board and peremptorily selected Bally’s. As Alderman Brian Hopkins (D) put it “She gave us a cat toy to bat across the carpet while she was in the back room making her secret deals.” The new council is intended to provide quarterly advice on various fait accompli such as the permanent casino and the temporary one in Medinah Temple.

Of 42 action items (like curtailing outdoor musical performances) River North Residents Association prexy Brian Israel sighed “I think we’ll get some things. Others will be difficult and expensive and take a long time and some others will probably be off the table. But we have to do the best we can on behalf of our constituents. We’re appreciative that the administration is at least open to having a dialogue with the community.” Fuming that the new council was a rubber stamp Alderman Brendan Reilly (D) vented “The lack of downtown stakeholders from the 42nd Ward and the exclusion of important neighborhood groups is frustrating. It’s pretty clear the administration doesn’t have much interest in hearing from those people who are most directly impacted by the temporary and permanent casinos.”

MCHP,Microchip Technology,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaXNwYXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC8yMDIyLzA5LzA5L29oaW8taW50ZWwtYmlkZW4tc3BlZWNoLW1pY3JvY2hpcC1mYWN0b3J5LWdyb3VuZGJyZWFraW5nLXByb2plY3QvNjYwMDkzODcwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Biden visits Ohio to break ground on $20 billion Intel project,"West Coast technology officially came together Friday with Midwest manufacturing prowess to create the Silicon Heartland.

Under a sun-splashed late summer day President Joe Biden joined Ohio political educational union and business leaders to break ground on Intel's $20 billion project in Licking County to create the world's most advanced semiconductor factories. It is the state's largest economic development prize.

Friday's groundbreaking also served as a celebration of the recently enacted CHIPS and Science Act that is meant to restore U.S. production of the tiny devices that power everything from cellphones to computers to cars to military equipment that has been largely shipped overseas. Biden signed the legislation into law last month and Intel has said the legislation will play a meaningful role in how it develops the site in Ohio.

Shortages of the chips have plagued the economy since the pandemic and have contributed to the rising cost of cars and other products.

President Biden gives speech on site of Intel microchip factory project groundbreaking

""Folks we need to make these chips right here in America to bring down everyday costs and create good jobs’’ Biden told about 700 people who gathered at the site.

Intel has been working for about two months at the site and not even Friday's ceremony stopped the earth moving work taking place behind the temporary stage where Biden political leaders educational leaders Intel executives and others spoke.

""The Rust Belt is dead and the Silicon Heartland begins"" Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said.

""This idea of Silicon Heartland (is) an epicenter of leading-edge technology and Intel's factories right here will produce the most advanced process technologies in the world"" he said. ""Our customers .... need the best stuff for their products everything from high-performance mobile artificial intelligence advance computing cloud all of that will be a result of these factories behind us.""

Gelsinger called the CHIPS Act the most significant piece of industrial legislation since World War II. Intel has said it is too soon to determine how much benefit it will get from the legislation.

The CHIPS Act provides $52.7 billion in incentives plus tax incentives for companies to research design and manufacture semiconductors and to help with workforce development.

As he did in his State of the Union speech in March Biden said the 1000-acre New Albany site is a ""field of dreams where America's future will be built.""

American production of semiconductors has stumbled from 37% in 1990 to about 12% today and that has put the country at risk as other countries offer billions of dollars to lure semiconductors Biden said.

The legislation has triggered a series of announcements by companies across the country to build semiconductor operations Biden said.

""The future of the chip industry is going to be made in America"" he said

The groundbreaking caps a frenzied eight months since Intel picked Licking County from a nationwide search as its spot for what could become the world's largest semiconductor operation with as many as eight plants - called ""fabs"" in the industry - and a total investment of $100 billion.

The plants will employ 3000 workers earning an average of $135000. There will be 7000 construction workers at the site as well. The plants also are expected to be a draw for Intel suppliers who will create thousands more jobs.

The Licking County plants are expected to start producing semiconductors in 2025.

""We can we must and we will make them here"" Gov. Mike DeWine said.

DeWine called the groundbreaking an historic moment for the state.

""We celebrate a great victory for Ohio but an even greater victory for our country"" he said.

What will Intel's plants in New Albany make?

Intel has said the campus in New Albany will be among its most advanced turning out semiconductors with a variety of applications for cars cellphones computers and other devices critical to a modern economy.

""It is a very important site. ... This will be a top-notch fab the most advanced fab in the country and the planet"" Intel Senior Vice President Randhir Thakur said in an interview with The Dispatch.

Beyond that the plants are expected to play a key role in Intel's new foundry business that was launched last year and is being led by Thakur.

Foundry work comes from companies that design their own semiconductors but use other companies to make them. Until now it's been a tiny part of Intel's business but Gelsinger has pledged to make it a much bigger part of Intel's business and that includes the new plants in Ohio.

As part of this foundry work Thakur said the New Albany plants will manufacture chips for the military and military contractors. Intel has said it expects the market for foundry work to grow from $90 billion a year to $200 billion a year by 2030.

Exactly how much of that business will be done in Ohio will be determined over time Thakur said.

Groundbreaking receives bipartisan support

Politicians from both sides of the aisles have rallied around the Intel project. A host of state legislative leaders praised the project as did Sens. Rob Portman a Republican and Sherrod Brown a Democrat during Friday's ceremonies that ran for more than two hours.

""Today as we acknowledge all the hard work that went into bringing Intel to Ohio we also acknowledge the hard work before us that now begins as we begin to close America's competitiveness gap that has grown dangerously wide in regard to semiconductor manufacturing"" Portman said. ""I'm really proud Ohioans will play an important role in closing this gap.""

Brown said in January when he flew to Ohio for the Intel announcement that the news marked a major change for the Ohio economy.

""I remember looking out the window of the plane at all the places that have been long been ignored by Wall Street and passed over by corporate America and forgotten by our government and I thought about how from that day forward we're going to change that"" Brown recalled telling Portman and others on the flight ""Today we're burying the term Rust Belt.""

Industry leaders welcome Intel project

""It's hard to state how important this is"" said Jay Timmons president and CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers and a native of Circleville who attended Friday's groundbreaking.

""We see what happens when we depend on critical products coming from overseas especially during the pandemic"" Timmons said noting how hard the shortage of semiconductors has made it to buy cars for example.

The CHIPS Act demonstrates how indispensable technology is in today's economy and the law is critical to help ensure that shortages don't happen again said Jason Oxman CEO of the Information Technology Industry Council a global advocate for technology.

""For both economic reasons and national security reasons growing semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. is vitally important"" Oxman said. ""We don't have to speculate on what a shortage of semiconductors means to the U.S. economy.""

Expectations are high: at least a 100x increase in computing power while keeping the same energy consumption.

NASA will soon perform a significant upgrade to the systems employed in its spaceflight computers adopting the RISC-V architecture developed and provided under open-source licenses. NASA selected SiFive to provide the CPU cores a fitting choice as the company headquartered in San Mateo California was founded 7 years ago to develop RISC-V based hardware (where ""V"" indicates this is the fifth generation RISC instruction set) and put compatible processors on the market.

SiFive is a fabless chip company so actual production of the chips will be in the hands of Microchip Technology a company based in Chandler Arizona specialized in manufacturing microcontrollers EEPROM chips and other IC products.

NASA awarded a $50 million contract to the two companies expecting the final delivery of the new X280 CPU in a 3-year timeframe. X280 will be the computational foundation of the High Performance Spaceflight Computing (HPSC) project NASA's initiative to design and develop new spaceflight technology capable of providing ""at least"" 100 times the computational capability of currently employed systems while using the same amount of energy.

X280 will replace the RAD750 processor an aging PowerPC-based CPU manufactured by BAE Systems and employed in several NASA missions since 2005. The Mars Perseverance rover and the recently launched James Webb telescope are two of the most celebrated space endeavours made possible by the RAD750 CPU.

The X280 CPU currently in development for the HPSC system will utilize 8 SiFive Intelligence RISC-V vector cores with 4 additional cores which will provide the computational capability jump NASA is projecting before retiring today's space computers. According to SiFive the massive increase in performance will help usher in new possibilities for autonomous rovers vision processing space flight guidance systems communication and other mission elements in space exploration.

Today NASA is fervently continuing this trend as the organization prepares for future missions to the moon and beyond.

One of the exciting new technologies in NASA’s queue is their High-Performance Spaceflight Computer (HPSC) project. Supporting that effort earlier this week SiFive announced being selected by NASA to provide its RISC-V core in NASA’s HPSC.

In this article we’ll look at the SiFive NASA news examine NASA’s goal for the HPSC and highlight another HPSC awarded by NASA to Microchip Technology last month.

SiFive’s RISC-V Core Headed for Space

NASA has commissioned SiFive to provide the core CPU for the HPSC and specifically SiFive will be using its X280 processor core. The X280 is an 8-core RISC-V processor that offers vector extensions and AI/ML edge computing optimizations.

X280 which is built off a 64-bit RISC-V ISA and an 8-stage dual-issue in-order pipeline is capable of 4.6 TOPS of performance. Alongside the X280 NASA will also be leveraging four additional SiFive RISC-V cores.

Besides the performance one major reason that NASA may be interested in SiFive’s cores is that they are RISC-V offerings. RISC-V allows NASA to benefit from the support flexibility and long-term viability of the open-source standard as well as allowing for the HPSC to improve over time as the RISC-V ISA also improves. As more industry and academic institutions contribute to the RISC-V movement the HPSC can also reap these accumulated benefits.

NASA HPSC Project

According to NASA the HPSC project is focused on developing flight computing technology that is both highly performant and resistant to the harsh space environment. Specifically NASA has listed its goal of HPSC achieving a 100x compute improvement over current space computers. Further NASA is aiming to design HPSC to be highly flexible and efficient being able to adapt to support either high-power missions that require real-time compute or low-power deep sleep operations.

To do this NASA has its sights set on a computing architecture based on multicore computing chips with multiple processing cores on each chip. Along with this NASA will aim to leverage radiation-hardened designs in order to ensure reliable computer operation even in the face of the harsh space environment. To achieve these goals NASA has decided to contract out the HPSC development to multiple industry players including Microchip Technology.

Microchip’s HPSC Contract

In August NASA began announcing contract awards for the HPSC with the first recipient being Microchip Technology. According to NASA it will be relying on Microchip to be responsible for the architecture and design of a new processor for the HPSC. The goal is for Microchip’s processor architecture to help enable a large improvement in computing efficiency as well as offer a high level of fault-tolerance.

Microchip’s aerospace offerings. Image used courtesy of Microchip Technology

One reason that NASA may have gone with Microchip for this contract is because of the company’s prominent line of radiation-tolerant and radiation-hardened devices. Unlike other computing companies Microchip has already proven an extensive and successful background in space-computing making the assignment for the HPSC a realistic one for the company. The contract which pays Microchip $50 million expects Microchip to deliver the new processor within 3 years.

There’s no publicly announced connection between the SiFive RISC-V core selection and the Microchip HPSC processor contract but one could easily speculate that the SiFive core will be used in Microchip’s HPSC processor design.

Innovation in Space

Space exploration has always driven technological innovation and NASA is aiming to do exactly that with the HPSC. Thanks to contracts with Microchip and SiFive NASA has its sights set on an 100x performance improvement over the current state-of-the-art. The hope is that these improvements will help benefit all types of future missions including everything from Earth science missions to deep-space exploration.

Wolfspeed formerly known as Cree on Friday said it will build a $5 billion factory near Siler City North Carolina about 45 miles southwest of its home city of Durham. The opening is set for 2030 and the company expects to create 1800 new jobs.

It’s the latest company to unveil big expansion plans after Congress and President Biden approved the CHIPS Act which provides at least $50 billion for U.S.-based research design and manufacturing of semiconductors. Intel and Micron Technology both announced expansion plans following the law’s approval.

Wolfspeed’s choice also represents another big economic development project in the Triangle and Piedmont Triad regions of North Carolina following Toyota near Greensboro and electric vehicle maker VinFast near Raleigh.

“Wolfspeed’s decision further validates North Carolina as the epicenter of clean energy” Gov. Roy Cooper said in a news release.

North Carolina will provide Wolfspeed with $76.1 million in tax incentives based on job creation. The state also promised $57.5 million for site preparation and $10 million for infrastructure upgrades.

The company will work with North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in Greensboro to develop workforce training programs.

Newest Plant

Wolfspeed already operates a chip manufacturing facility in Research Triangle Park in North Carolina. In April it opened a 557000 square-foot factory near Utica New York focused on silicon carbide device fabrication.

The company's new North Carolina facility will focus on silicon carbide-based semiconductors for use in electric vehicles and renewable energy and storage.

While the CHIPS Act is designed to bolster the United States’ position in semiconductors and reduce its reliance on Chinese chips the broader semiconductor market has struggled.

Lower demand for personal computers and phones which all rely heavily on semiconductors have dragged down chip manufacturers.

The Philadelphia semiconductor index has dropped 34% this year compared to a 16% drop in the S&P 500. Stocks are down for both domestic and overseas chipmakers including Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.

But Wolfspeed which specializes in chips for automobiles and power supply has been an outlier. Its stock climbed 28% to $111.29 per share over a 12-month period through Sept. 8.

The chip industry is slowly recovering from supply chain issues that dramatically slowed global deliveries. Tom Sweet chief financial officer of Dell Technologies said this week that the supply chain for chips used in personal computers has largely returned to normal according to Bloomberg.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvc2VwLzEwL2JpZGVuLXZpc2l0cy1jaGlwLXBsYW50LWluLW9oaW8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Biden visits chip plant in Ohio | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"President Joe Biden on Friday highlighted a rare bipartisan down payment to boost U.S. manufacturing as he attended the groundbreaking of a $20 billion Intel computer chip facility in Ohio.

Biden traveled to suburban Columbus to take a victory lap at the plant being constructed by Intel Corp. which had delayed construction on the facility until Congress passed the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act.

The new law provides $28 billion in incentives for domestic semiconductor production $10 billion for new manufacturing of chips and $11 billion for research and development. It remains unclear how much if any federal funding the Intel plant will receive.

The funding follows similar efforts by Europe and China to accelerate chip production which political leaders see as essential for competing economically and militarily.

""Folks we need to make these chips right here in America to bring down everyday costs and create good jobs"" Biden said. ""Industry leaders are choosing us the United States because they see America's back and America's leading the way.""

Touring the construction site the president chatted with unionized workers in hard hats and noted his own blue-collar credentials by saying ""These are my people where I come from.""

In his State of the Union address in March Biden envisioned the Intel plant as a model for a U.S. economy that revolves around technology factories and the middle class.

The plant speaks to how the president is trying to revive American manufacturing nationwide.

Elsewhere in the U.S. chipmaker Micron Technology Inc. committed $15 billion for a factory in Idaho Corning Inc. will build an optical fiber facility in Arizona and First Solar Inc. plans to construct its fourth solar panel plant in the Southeast all announcements that stemmed from Biden administration initiatives.

As part of Biden's visit Friday Intel announced that it's providing $17.7 million to Ohio colleges and universities to develop education programs focused on the computer chips sector.

The shortage of semiconductors has plagued the U.S. and global economies. It cut into production of autos household appliances and other goods in ways that fueled high inflation while creating national security risks as the U.S. recognized its dependence on Asia for chip production.

The mix of high prices and long waits for basic goods has left many Americans feeling disgruntled about Biden's economic leadership a political weakness that has lessened somewhat as gasoline prices have fallen and many voters have grown concerned about the loss of abortion protections after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.

Lawmakers crafted the semiconductor investments to favor areas outside the wealthier coastal cities where tech dominates. That means change will be coming to the Ohio city of New Albany where the Intel plant is being constructed as well as nearby Johnstown.

Don Harvey a sporting goods store owner and longtime Johnstown resident likes the idea of a company making things again in the United States and also providing potentially high-paying jobs for his five grandchildren down the road. Intel has said pay will average $135000 for its 3000 Ohio workers.

""What an opportunity in my eyes for Ohio and the United States as a whole"" said the 63-year-old Harvey.

Elyse Priest lives in a subdivision just up the road from the plant and received a firsthand taste of the construction recently as she watched a huge cloud of dust roll up from the 1000-acre site currently being leveled. Priest 38 also knows the road-widening and added traffic will affect her commute to downtown Columbus where she works as a legal assistant.

""I'm concerned about losing the small-town feel I've always had and loved about Johnstown"" Priest said. ""But I know it's going to be a greater good for the whole state.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3RlY2gtbmV3cy9pbmRpYS1tYXktc2VlLXRyaWNrbGUtZG93bi1iZW5lZml0cy1vZi11cy1jaGlwcy1hY3QtMTE2NjI2NjUyMzMyODguaHRtbNIBeWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3RlY2gtbmV3cy9pbmRpYS1tYXktc2VlLXRyaWNrbGUtZG93bi1iZW5lZml0cy1vZi11cy1jaGlwcy1hY3QvYW1wLTExNjYyNjY1MjMzMjg4Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India may see trickle-down benefits of US CHIPS Act | Mint,"NEW DELHI : The ban on American chipmakers building advanced technology facilities in China if they have received federal funding under the CHIPS Act could benefit countries such as India over the years experts said.

The US government’s Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act 2022 aims to incentivize technology companies to build semiconductor factories in the country. However companies accepting federal funding for the same are barred from building high-tech facilities in China for the next 10 years.

Satya Gupta chief executive and founder of Electronic Products Innovation Consortium (EPIC) Foundation said that while in the short term the US will benefit from these policies in the medium term i.e. three years or more it could benefit markets like India.

“The $50 billion plus incentives from the US may be utilized by then and firms will look to expand globally and India would be a good choice. By then markets like India too will have evolved to a stage where these global firms will see benefit in setting up advanced semiconductor manufacturing here"" he said.

Introduced on 9 August the new US law comes amid tensions with China. While the scheme aims to strengthen the US manufacturing base experts believe the 10-year embargo on high-tech manufacturing in China will eventually drive firms to markets like India Europe and Vietnam.

The US scheme offers incentives totalling $53 billion (around ₹4.2 trillion) for firms building chip factories in the US. These are more than five times India’s ₹76000 crore (approximately $10 billion) production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for chipmakers announced earlier this year.

Among the world’s top 10 chip design and manufacturing firms US chipmakers earned 33.2% of $59.5 billion that global semiconductor companies earned in 2021 according to an April 2022 report by market researcher Gartner. Samsung Intel SK Hynix Micron Qualcomm Broadcom MediaTek Texas Instruments Nvidia and AMD comprised the top 10. Other than Samsung MediaTek and SK Hynix the rest are American firms.

The White House said Micron and Qualcomm plan to build new facilities in the US. While Micron plans to spend $40 billion by 2030 to make memory chips in the US Qualcomm will partner with GlobalFoundries for a $4.2 billion chip-manufacturing plan in the US. Intel which initially announced a $20 billion semiconductor fab in Ohio said in June that its plan was delayed to understand the CHIPS Act. The company now plans to begin work on its factory by end-2022 and production is expected to begin by 2025.

India currently does not have an ecosystem in place for advanced semiconductor manufacturing. However conglomerates such as the Tata group and Vedanta have expressed interest in setting up chip operations here and the government has also received interest from some global firms. Commerce minister Piyush Goyal met executives of American chip companies such as LAM Research and Applied Materials on 8 September to explore greater collaboration with Indian companies.

In April Applied Materials said it plans to invest $50 million in a new research and development (R&D) facility in India while Mint reported last month that LAM Research plans to set up its second R&D facility in India this month.

“India has already introduced a production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme to attract global clients. Alongside this it’s not like India has no existing ecosystem of the semiconductor industry—the semiconductor laboratory (SCL) in Mohali Punjab manufactures semiconductor chips in partnership with local and Israeli suppliers"" noted Vivek Tyagi chairman of industry body Indian Electronics and Semiconductor Association (IESA).

Rajeev Khushu adviser and board member of IESA said that semiconductor supply chain vendors in India do not have the necessary quality to match the global standards required for making the latest generation chips. SCL for instance still makes 180nm chips at its facility.This according to both Khushu and Tyagi could see semiconductor fabs come up in India over the next five years as global tech firms look at markets beyond Taiwan Korea and China to set up advanced facilities.

“India has already seen some interest from vendors to set up assembly testing marking and packaging (ATMP) facilities in the country based on the semiconductor PLI scheme which could precede the establishment of chip factories since the latter would take larger sums of investment"" Khushu said.

Navkendar Singh associate vice-president at market research firm International Data Corp (IDC) India said “What China has succeeded in doing has been to bring down the pricing of chips thanks to vastly available and affordable skilled labour and the overall scale of manufacturing. This could be a factor that semiconductor firms struggle to meet in the immediate future.""

Singh added that moving the manufacturing of chips away to other markets (including India and the US) could see companies incur a higher cost of manufacturing.

“It is also unlikely that any company will ever put all their eggs in one basket again so India will likely not be the sole beneficiary of the US‘ new law. The overall impact could see India make gains in the semiconductor space in the long run but it will most likely not be the only nation taking advantage of the diversification of the semiconductor supply chain"" Singh added.

Microsoft launched a 16.7 percent discount valid until June 30 for customers new to Microsoft 365 and existing customers who want to upgrade to a more premium product – a help to some partners still dealing with the rollout of the “new commerce experience” platform while still leaving in place some issues partners have with NCE.

The discount – aimed at small and midsize customers and called the “Microsoft 365 SMB and New Customer Upsell Promotion for Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) Customers” – is for customers who buy “a low-risk monthly commitment” for a variety of Microsoft 365 plans Microsoft Teams Essentials and Microsoft Defender for Business according to an announcement by the Redmond Wash.-based tech giant.

The valid M365 plans are Business Basic Business Standard Business Premium and Apps for Business. The discount does not work on “legacy” subscriptions – ones made off NCE.

Did Microsoft Change NCE?

CRN has reached out to Microsoft for comment. The company announced the promotion on Sept. 1.

In a document explaining the 16.7 percent discount Microsoft said it created the discount “to enable partners to pitch how Microsoft 365 can help prospective and existing customers ‘Do More with Less’ by consolidating vendors or improving their security and productivity posture with a more premium product.”

For new customers to M365 “This promotion creates immediate cost savings both in product value and price point for new customers while allowing customers and partners to retain the flexibility of a monthly commitment” according to Microsoft.

For customers interested in upgrading to a higher subscription type “This promotion is a fantastic opportunity for partners to explore with their existing customers how upgrading to products like Microsoft 365 Business Premium – or expanding their Microsoft 365 investment with standalone products like Microsoft Defender for Business – can save existing customers money through vendor consolidation while providing necessary productivity and security value” according to Microsoft.

Lane Shelton director of licensing for Core BTS – an Indianapolis-based Microsoft partner and member of CRN’s 2022 Solution Provider 500 – told CRN in an interview that the promotion helps his business because he upgrades a lot of customers to the Business Premium subscription.

At the beginning of the NCE roll out Core BTS used the conversations with customers to try to upsell them on Microsoft products.

“We‘ve had a lot of customers transition up which I don’t think they would have done if NCE didn’t force them to talk to us” Shelton said. “Especially back in the early days when they had the discounts on the annual SKUs (stock-keeping units) we’d be like ‘Hey you have got to talk to us in the next 30 days because maybe we can save you some money.’”

He continued: “Every customer would talk to us. And then they ended up upgrading. And so it was great because they got extra discounts. They got to upgrade. We got more revenue. The customer was happy. So there was a lot of that stuff. We would like for that to continue.”

But Microsoft still has not fixed one of the main issues with NCE – when customers buy an annual commitment customers are unable to change managed service providers until the contract ends which can result in partners taking on a customer and forgoing revenue until the end of the contract with the original MSP.

“We just would like for Microsoft to give us portability for customers” Shelton said. “And we’re more than happy to risk losing our customers to our competitors to have that benefit. Because we just think that that’s the biggest gap that they have right now. … (Dropping the 20 percent monthly premium) would mean that we could still do monthly SKUs with the vast majority of our customers.”

The 20 percent premium on month-to-month commitments also punishes customers with seasonal businesses that like to change license counts month to month Microsoft partners have told CRN.

And if customers buy annual commitments to M365 packages partners may be on the hook paying out the rest of the contract should the customer go out of business or need fewer licenses.

In July Microsoft rescinded a policy that encouraged partners to move legacy subscriptions under its Cloud Solution Provider program to NCE by January – providing an indefinite delay to when partners need to move existing subscriptions to NCE.

However partners selling new subscriptions for M365 packages have to sell them through NCE – and thus with the 20 percent premium for monthly commitments – unless the customer is upgrading to a higher subscription type or is new to M365. Then they get the 16.7 percent discount.

More On The Discount

The discount ends for customers on the first monthly anniversary date after June 30 according to Microsoft. The discount ends automatically.

Or “[p]artners can work with their customers to transition to a standard NCE annual commitment from the monthly commitment promotional offer” according to Microsoft. “This can be done at any time during the promotional period. Cancellations and adjusting automatic renewal can be scheduled in advance as well.”

Microsoft continued: “Partners should decide with their customers whether an annual or monthly commitment makes most sense based on customer need and credit risk.”

Microsoft encourages partners to lead upselling conversations with the tech giant’s security offerings according to the document explaining the discount. Partners can also use the uncertain economy as a talking point because “pressures from the evolving global economy are requiring organizations to reduce costs and optimize operations as they continue to shift to a world of hybrid work.”

Features in Partner Center can help partners determine if customers are eligible for the promotion. Customers with annual commitments cannot change existing subscriptions to monthly. Customers can cancel monthly subscriptions during the first 168 hours after renewal for a pro-rated refund according to Microsoft.

NCE isn’t the only major change Microsoft has announced for partners in 2022. In August the company unveiled changes around virtual core licensing and outsourcing certain licenses on Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services data centers.

This was followed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ recommendation for use of the Pfizer bivalent booster vaccine for ages 12 years and older and the Moderna bivalent vaccine for ages 18 years and older.

“This is great news as we go into the fall and winter when we expect cases of COVID-19 to increase” said Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) chief medical executive. “The bivalent booster will help fight the Omicron subvariants including BA.4 and 5. COVID-19 vaccines remain our best defense against the virus and we recommend all Michiganders stay up to date.”

The Moderna and Pfizer bivalent boosters target two strains of COVID-19 – the original strain of the virus and the most widely-spread Omicron variants (BA.4 and BA.5). Individuals ages 12 years and older who have completed any FDA-approved or FDA-authorized monovalent primary series (Pfizer Moderna Novavax or Johnson & Johnson) or previously received monovalent booster doses are eligible to receive one bivalent (Pfizer or Moderna) COVID-19 booster.

Michiganders can begin getting the bivalent vaccines as they become available. MDHHS has worked with vaccine providers across the state to ensure they were prepared for the arrival of the bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccines. Older formulations of booster doses will no longer be available to persons 12 and older as the FDA has removed authorization for those boosters.

To locate providers offering the Pfizer and Moderna bivalent booster doses check your local pharmacy or visit vaccines.gov which will be updated with bivalent booster locations soon.

Who is eligible to receive a single bivalent booster dose and when:

Individuals 18 years of age and older are eligible for a single booster dose of the bivalent Moderna COVID-19 vaccine if it has been at least two months since they completed primary vaccination or received the most recent booster dose with any authorized or approved monovalent COVID-19 vaccine.

Individuals 12 years of age and older are eligible for a single booster dose of the bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine if it has been at least two months since they completed primary vaccination or received the most recent booster dose with any authorized or approved monovalent COVID-19 vaccine.

Individuals may choose to receive either the Pfizer or Moderna bivalent booster regardless of which primary series vaccine or original booster dose they had previously. Influenza vaccines which are now available in Michigan can also be co-administered with the COVID-19 bivalent booster doses.

To date nearly 6.8 million Michiganders ages 5 and up have gotten at least their first dose of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. Eligible Michiganders are encouraged to stay up to date on vaccinations which includes booster doses that provide extra protection and residents of long-term care facilities where outbreaks can spread quickly and extra protection is strongly recommended.

MDHHS also encourages Michigan residents to pay attention to local guidance as some communities may be at a higher risk of COVID-19 transmission.

To schedule a primary or booster dose of the COVID vaccine visit vaccines.gov.

Governor Kathy Hochul

New reformulated COVID-19 booster shots are out from Pfizer and Moderna.

They're designed to combat Omicron but also include an ""ancestral"" virus component.

As long as it's been at least 2 months since your last COVID-19 vaccine it's fine to line up and get one.

The very first updated COVID-19 vaccines are here.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) signed off on two new vaccines last week — one from Pfizer one from Moderna. For now Pfizer's is for everyone 12 years old and up while Moderna's is only for adults over 18.

Both new vaccines are designed to fight against the BA.4 and BA.5 versions of Omicron which are what is currently circulating across the US.

Here is what you need to know about them.

These may be the last free COVID-19 vaccines you'll get

This fall booster campaign is likely the last chance you'll get to have free COVID-19 shots from the US government.

Reuters reported last week that the Department of Health and Human Services is planning to ""transition procurement and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics from a federally managed system to the commercial marketplace"" in 2023.

The shots are 'bivalent' meaning they target 2 versions of the virus

New York Governor's Office

Half of the mRNA product is targeted against ""ancestral"" SARS-CoV-2 meaning it's the same stuff that was in previous vaccines. The other 50% of the dose is designed to combat BA.4 and BA.5 which are the specific versions of Omicron we are dealing with right now.

Having a bivalent product means that we will have good protection if and when the virus mutates again — even if it drifts away from the currently-circulating Omicron variants.

The strategy is similar to how vaccine-makers treat influenza. This year's flu vaccine for example is quadrivalent meaning it is formulated to fight back against four distinct flu types.

Moderna's shot is still bigger than Pfizer's

The total mRNA volume of these vaccines is exactly the same size as previous booster shots:

The Pfizer shot contains 30ug while Moderna's shot contains 50ug per dose.

If you recently had COVID wait a couple months

On green-lighting these boosters the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said anyone can get one ""at least two months"" after their last COVID-19 shot.







If you had COVID this summer you can technically get your booster any time.

However health officials at the CDC say ""people who recently had SARS-CoV-2 infection may consider delaying a primary series dose or booster dose by three months.""

Epidemiologist Katelyn Jetelina recommends waiting at least two months after a COVID-19 infection the same as you would after any previous COVID-19 shot.

""We do not have to wait 3 months after infection"" Jetelina explained in a recent newsletter. ""We won't 'exhaust' or 'overwhelm' our immune system but by delaying we get the biggest bang for our vaccine buck.""

Will you need a yearly COVID booster? Experts are divided

President Biden has suggested that COVID-19 vaccines are going to become an annual tradition much like flu shots are now.

""One COVID-19 shot once a year each fall"" he said on Tuesday in a statement.

Infectious disease experts aren't so sure about that. Many are hoping that new kinds of COVID-19 vaccines being developed could be better long-term solutions than the shots we have now. Some new vaccines are being designed as nasal sprays you can inhale or patches you'd put on your skin while other ""universal"" vaccines could target multiple different coronaviruses all at once.

Symptoms include arm pain and fatigue

The four most common side effects for both bivalent boosts have included:

arm pain at the injection site fatigue headaches and myalgia (generalized muscle aches and pains) after the shot is administered.

While this side effect data was generated from vaccine trials in people who got bivalent boosters targeted to BA.1 that's a version of Omicron that ""only differs slightly"" from BA.4/5 according to Dr. Peter Marks who directs the FDA's division in charge of vaccine safety and effectiveness. Vaccine side effects are expected to be very similar if not identical with these new shots.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lZHBhZ2V0b2RheS5jb20vc3BlY2lhbC1yZXBvcnRzL2ZlYXR1cmVzLzEwMDYzM9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Health System Warns Exemptions to COVID Vaccines May Expire With New Options,"The Froedtert Health network in Wisconsin has sent a clear message to employees claiming religious exemptions from COVID-19 vaccination: with an alternative to mRNA vaccines now available get vaccinated or resign.

In an email to a Froedtert staff member obtained by WTMJ-TV the health network's COVID-19 Vaccine Religious Exemption Review Committee wrote ""Your original exemption submission and additional documentation you provided do not meet the criteria of explaining your sincerely held religious belief that conflicts with receiving the COVID-19 vaccine including the new Novavax vaccine.""

The religious exemption will not be upheld despite additional comments provided that ""related to opinions or non-factual information"" the committee added. If the staff member does not get a first dose by September 21 they will be ""considered voluntarily resigned.""

The move by Froedtert which is affiliated with the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee signals a blow to vaccine holdouts in the workplace including healthcare providers who have argued their religion prevents them from getting vaccinated.

While the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mRNA-based Novavax is protein-based. Those who requested religious exemptions to their work or school policies have often cited the use of fetal material in mRNA vaccines or in their development though neither Novavax nor the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines contain fetal tissue or DNA. However it has been reported that laboratory-replicated fetal cell lines some originating from abortions decades ago have been used in the testing of mRNA vaccines.

Dorit Reiss PhD a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco who has researched religious exemptions from vaccines told MedPage Today it was only a matter of time before some employers including hospitals started to enforce vaccination policies after Novavax was authorized for use in August.

""I've said publicly before that I think Novavax does change the situation in relation to arguments about cell lines"" she said. ""This is the first I've heard of an employer actually moving on it.""

An emailed statement from Froedtert to MedPage Today said in part ""This protein-based vaccination option eliminates conflicts for those staff with religious or medical exemptions caused by mRNA-based vaccines and other concerns. Since those staff are now eligible for a vaccination that does not conflict with their religious beliefs or medical situation their exemption will expire.""

The health network said that the rule will affect less than 1% of their staff and that ""impacted employees"" were given a chance to apply for another exemption before previous ones expired noting they will uphold ""valid medical exemptions and sincerely held religious exemptions.""

Reiss said of the many claims to back up religious exemptions she's come across the fetal cell line argument was perhaps the most common partially because it might curry favor from pro-life judges. ""If they can piggyback on the abortion debate they're more likely to win"" in a dispute she said. But other reasons like the claim that some religions require blood to be free of contamination have also been used.

Some vocal opponents of vaccine requirements may have anticipated the post-Novavax repercussions and urged their followers to use other reasons to back up their religious objections Reiss said.

For example Cait Corrigan a Boston University theology student behind a group called Students Against Mandates posted an online outline to the group's website with tips for ""successful"" religious exemption letters writing ""Note you can write about aborted fetal tissue ... but this is not enough! (You must talk about the issue of Blood in the vaccines being made in the Image of God etc.)"" (MedPage Today could not confirm whether Corrigan is still a student at Boston University.)

But neither these types of arguments nor religious beliefs are likely to hold up in most courts according to Reiss and other experts. ""The standard for vaccine mandates in the workplace is you can refuse an exemption if it's an undue burden like the burden of not having vaccinated employees at a hospital"" she said.

And though objections to vaccination itself may be sincere ""for most of them I think it's about safety concerns many of them created by misinformation"" Reiss noted. ""For most of them the religion is a cover for that concern.""

Alaska vaccine providers have ordered more than 38000 doses of the updated bivalent boosters with deliveries anticipated in early September.

The Moderna and Pfizer bivalent boosters target two strains of COVID-19 the original strain of the virus and two omicron subvariants BS.4 and BA.5 currently the most widespread subvariants.

Individuals aged 12 years and older are eligible if they have completed a primary series and it has been at least two months since either their primary or a booster dose. As of Aug. 31 the original monovalent booster is not available to people aged 12 years and older.

The Pfizer bivalent booster is currently authorized for people aged 12 years and older while Moderna’s is currently authorized for those ages 18 years and older.

Alaska Department of Health officials said people over 18 may choose to receive either the Pfizer or Moderna bivalent booster regardless of which product they received previously.

Quincey chief executive officer ranked the Coca-Cola Co. by buckets or podiums in a Sept. 8 presentation at the Barclays Consumer Staples Conference in Boston.

He listed the Coke brand as the first bucket or gold medal podium. Recently launched alcoholic drinks were ranked as the fourth bucket but with potential to move up to a medal-winning podium.

“(Coke is) a huge share of the beverage industry clear gold medalist far exceeds any other in that” Mr. Quincey said. “Then you got the silver medal if you like where we are No. 2 or No. 1 but we're not a distant No. 1 as we might be with Coke.”

He put Fanta Sprite and tea in this second bucket.

The third bucket revolves around a company vision to create scale for the company and what strategies are worth executing long term.

Mr. Quincey called the fourth bucket the “true experimentation bucket.”

Fruit-flavored alcoholic drinks including Simply Spiked alcoholic drinks created through the Molson Coors partnership have launched domestically and fruit-flavored alcoholic drinks are doing well in Japan and the Philippines he said. A partnership with Brown-Forman Corp. created the Jack Daniel’s & Coca-Cola cocktail this year.

The Coke brand remains the main driver of company sales though.

“If you're aiming to grow revenue of 5% to 6% Coke is going to be a piece of that” Mr. Quincey said. “In the rest of the portfolio each piece of the portfolio is only going to be decimals. Nothing is going to move the needle that much.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Executives at the company want that number to reach 90% within the next two to five years.

“From our perspective if our business would be only biscuits and chocolate we would see a much stronger top line and we would see a much stronger bottom line” said Dirk Van de Put chairman and chief executive officer in a Sept. 8 presentation at the Barclays Global Consumer Staples Conference in Boston. “That’s where we have to gradually move toward.”

That movement will take place through a balance between acquisitions and divestments continuing a strategy that already has seen the addition of nine businesses representing $2.8 billion in sales since 2018. Tate’s Bake Shop Gourmet Food Holdings Hu and Ricolino are just some of the businesses acquired by Mondelez in recent years.

The company isn’t in a rush to sell the 20% of its portfolio that falls outside of the two core categories though.

“It’s not like the categories that aren’t core for us are doing particularly bad and we feel that we need to exit right away” Mr. Van de Put said. “We see it more as a balancing act.”

Areas of focus for the chocolate category include stimulating seasonal gifting throughout the year by linking chocolate with holidays across different cultures. The company is underrepresented in both dark chocolate and premium chocolate and is investing to grow its share of those segments.

Opportunities also exist for Mondelez to leverage its core categories to improve its baked snack business which includes cakes and pastries. Mr. Van de Put described cakes and pastries as a “highly fragmented category” without a clear global leader and a close adjacency to the company’s biscuits capabilities.

Consumers can expect to see more pastries cakes and baked snacks bearing brand names like Oreo and Cadbury.

“There’s very little branding together with that fragmentation and the overall sophistication of the product is not very high” Mr. Van de Put said. “We see a big opportunity for consolidation for leveraging our brands to upgrade the quality of the products and really create an extension of the biscuit shelf.”

Within that space is a more affordable segment that Mondelez is tapping into with Chipita a brand of filled croissants and cake bars acquired earlier this year. The business which offers products under the 7Days Chipicao and Fineti brands generated sales of approximately $580 million in 2020. It already is helping the company gain wider distribution into lower-income households across multiple regions.

Mr. Van de Put valued the cakes and pastries market at $75 billion. A smaller category that falls under the baked snacks umbrella is health bars which he valued at $16 billion. Half of that market is in the United States home to Emeryville Calif.-based Clif Bar & Co. which Mondelez acquired in August for $2.9 billion.

“This is a category that slowed down because of the pandemic but is going to accelerate again in the coming years” Mr. Van de Put said. “We believe there are international expansion and above-average growth possibilities there.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyYW5kaW5naW5hc2lhLmNvbS9wdWJsaWNpcy1ncm91cGUtdmlldG5hbS13aW5zLWVmZmllLWZvci1rZWVwLXN0b3JpZXMtYWxpdmUtZm9yLW1vbmRlbGV6L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Publicis Groupe Vietnam Wins an Effie for its ‘Keep Stories Alive’ Campaign for Mondelez,"Publicis Groupe Vietnam has walked away with its first-ever Effie (a Silver) for ‘Keep Stories Alive’ created for Mondelez Kinh Do mooncakes – the only winner from Vietnam this year.

Publicis Vietnam joins a distinguished group of Effie winners whose marketing campaigns have been judged outstanding and effective in the Asia Pacific region with Mondelēz International also winning Marketer of the Year. It also is the first-ever Effue winner for Mondelez South East Asia region with Mondelēz International also winning Marketer of the Year overall.

“Winning an Effie is a testament to how our creativity truly solves business problems. Mondelez is one of our biggest most creatively ambitious clients and this campaign delivered real and measurable business results. We are thrilled to celebrate this awesome achievement” says Kate Bayona-Garcia CEO of Publicis Groupe Vietnam.

Created by Publicis (creative) Spark (media) Digitas (data) MSL (influencer and PR) and Prodigious (content) this campaign started with a challenge: Vietnam’s Trung Thu mid-autumn festival was losing its spirit becoming more of an obligation than an opportunity to connect with family under the moonlight.

Together Publicis Spark and Digitas in Vietnam found a way to trigger nostalgia by magically bring old family photographs to life using deep learning artificial intelligence from D-ID a leading technology company based in the United Kingdom and Israel.

The Kinh Do Trung Thu platform made it possible to see your ancestors smile blink and turn their heads as old photos came to life reliving family memories in the midst of a lockdown. It reached 47 million users created 420 million impressions while animating more than 186000 faces and doubling online sales targets.



“The mid-Autumn festival is about coming together celebrating together and sharing our stories. The Kinh Do brand stands for preserving and cherishing the traditional culture of Vietnam and being the connection between past present and the future – that was the objective of ‘Keep Stories Alive”! Congratulations and cheers to the Publicis-Mondelez partnership and to the entire Mooncake team on this recognition” says Sameer Yadav Director – Marketing Mondelez Vietnam.

Ravi Iyer Integrated Planning Director Publicis Worldwide adds: “Though it’s a novelty the Keep Stories Alive platform isn’t tech for tech’s sake: it gave people a compelling reason to engage with the brand and had an in-built social media virality that put Kinh Do top-of-mind. We were already thrilled to be the only agency from Vietnam to receive a shortlist – winning a Silver EFFIE is the icing on the cake.”

Suppliers to the global travel retail market discuss the factors having an impact on the road to recovery including rising cost of living supply chain challenges and the Russia-Ukraine conflict alongside the positive developments in air travel. We continue the series with Mondelez WTR Director Global Sales Carlos Granados Moyano.

How well has your GTR business performed over the first half of 2022? Which key markets are growing fastest and which are proving more challenging?

We are seeing very positive signs of recovery. Traffic is extremely positive at key international transfer hubs like Dubai Qatar Istanbul and Amsterdam and in turn we are seeing sales at a number of these locations surpassing 2019 performance with the channel’s #1 chocolate brand Toblerone leading the recovery of the category.

Europe in general had a very strong recovery particularly in holiday destination airports as well as regional airports less dependent on long haul flights.

Recovery in the Americas particularly North America and the Caribbean has been robust and quite swift from the beginning. More recently we are seeing strong results in South America with Brazil and Argentina leading the charge.

Asia Pacific is steadily starting to pick up but recovery is certainly being slowed by the lack of Chinese travellers with many locations historically dependent on their spend.

Now that more travellers are flying again after the pandemic what changes have there been in purchasing behaviour? Are passengers spending more or is the cost of living crisis in many countries affecting spending patterns?

Considering the additional current strains being placed on household budgets and consumers’ limited spending power the universal appeal and affordability of confectionery makes it an extremely powerful category and ideal driver for incremental spend over this period.

Suppliers are making great strides in terms of sustainability but where can the travel retail sector make further gains in this crucial area?

At Mondelez WTR we have a broad sustainability roadmap specifically for travel retail which we refer to as ‘Travel Retail Made Right’. We have identified several areas where we can leverage the power of our partnerships for the benefit of both people and planet.

The ingredients used in our products is one of the primary pillars of our Travel Retail Made Right commitment with 99% of our travel retail chocolate product portfolio currently using cocoa that is sourced sustainably through our Cocoa Life program. Cocoa Life aims to transform the lives and livelihoods of farmers and their communities through empowering women educating the young and inspiring lasting positive change. By 2025 100% of our chocolate will be made using only cocoa that is sustainably sourced.

What progress is travel retail making in switching to an omnichannel model and what achievements are you making to harness the potential of the digital retail space to boost sales in travel retail?

The pandemic has forced travel retail to close the gap on the domestic channel in switching to an omnichannel model. At Mondelez WTR our digital journey has been ongoing for a number of years but has always had a clear focus on how we can engage with next-generation shoppers wherever they engage and shop online with brands.

Alongside other campaigns our Cadbury Football Club activations across have delivered several channel-exclusive digital experiences that truly underline the differentiation of the channel including a world-first with our laser-printed chocolate bars augmented reality sleeves and interactive football game that challenges travellers to test their skills. The Cadbury FC campaign has also been supported by influencer collaborations with some of the UK’s top football personalities expanding the football fever beyond the airport to social media.

We are working closely with retailers to help leverage their platforms in our omnichannel universe. They are making significant investments in e-commerce and ‘Click & Collect’ platforms which provide brands with a valuable opportunity to connect and communicate with travellers and its important we capitalise on this.

When do you predict your GTR business will recover to pre-C0vid-19 levels?

Travel retail’s full recovery really hinges on the situation in Asia and specifically China. In some key locations we are already back at pre-2019 levels but in terms of a global recovery Asia is still lagging behind albeit with some very promising pockets of recovery. Once China’s borders open up assuming the appetite is still there to travel I would expect to see recovery to pre-Covid-19 levels really accelerate.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbGRhdGEuY29tL3N0b3JlL3JlcG9ydC9zcGFpbi1jb25mZWN0aW9uZXJ5LW1hcmtldC1hbmFseXNpcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Spain Confectionery Market Size and Trend Analysis by Categories and Segment Distribution Channel Packaging ...,"Spain Confectionery Market Overview

Along with the move Moody’s has released proposed changes to its SPO framework with a scoring system based on contributions to sustainability and alignment with principles.

Moody’s SPO service provides opinions on companies financial institutions’ and sovereign green social and sustainability-linked debt issuances and frameworks including assessments of sustainability impact and alignment to strategic frameworks and market standards. The practice was originally part of ESG research and assessments provider Vigeo Eiris acquired by Moody’s in 2019 and subsequently integrated into Moody’s ESG.

According to Moody’s the move will enhance the company’s capacity to provide SPOs “to meet growing global market demand for independent views on the credentials of labeled green social sustainability and sustainability-linked debt issuance.”

Sustainable debt issuance has surged over the past several years including growth of more than 60% in 2021 to reach around $1 trillion. While market headwinds have pressures issuance so far this year sustainable bond volumes have outperformed the broader market to reach a record 15% of global total issuance. Moody’s has forecast stronger green social sustainability and sustainability-linked (GSSS) bond volumes in the second half of the year.

MIS’ proposed SPO framework includes three key components including an Alignment with Principles Score indicating the instrument’s or framework’s assessed alignment with green social or sustainability principles and with MIS-identified best practices; a Contribution to Sustainability Score based on MIS’ opinion of the expected contribution of projects or assets financed by the proceeds or key performance targets to the issuer’s advancement of long-term sustainable development and; an Overall Sustainability Quality Score based on the alignment and contribution scores for an opinion of the overall sustainability quality of a financial instrument or financing framework.

Moody’s stated that it is seeking feedback on the proposed framework inviting market participants to comment by September 15.

The legal battle between Twitter and Elon Musk has yielded a clue as to who manages the world's richest person's finances.

On September 1 the social media giant subpoenaed 18 bankers to testify in the suit which seeks to compel Musk to follow through with the $43 billion acquisition of Twitter. The bulk of the individuals are technology investment bankers at Morgan Stanley which arranged the deal financing before Musk sought to back out of the transaction.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

But buried in the filings was the subpoena of Jon D. Neuhaus a private wealth advisor and managing director at Morgan Stanley who has been with the bank for nearly 17 years. (Neuhaus is not party to the lawsuit.) His nine-person team which he leads with fellow banker Frank Malone manages more than $78.8 billion in assets for some 150 families and their foundations according to Morgan Stanley's website. Neuhaus and Malone serve clients worth at least $2 million and both have been recognized as top advisors by Barron's Forbes and the Financial Times.

Musk has a long history with Morgan Stanley which started extending loans to the Tesla CEO in May 2011 per Securities and Exchange Commission filings secured by his shares of the electric automaker. His right-hand man Jared Birchall even worked with Neuhaus at Morgan Stanley as well as Merrill Lynch earlier in their careers.

Until now Neuhaus has not been publicly tied to Musk other than through his association with Birchall. One former colleague of both the bankers told Insider that their Merrill Lynch team which moved to Morgan Stanley in 2006 served Musk.

Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Here is what we know about the veteran wealth manager.

LinkedIn screen capture

Jon Neuhaus came from a solidly middle-class background

Neuhaus 50 was raised in Connecticut according to an article in Green Bay Press-Gazette from 2001. He told the local paper that he was a diehard Green Bay Packers fan thanks to his father a Milwaukee native. Neuhaus even produced a film in 2017 called the ""The 60 Yard Line"" which followed Packers fan who lives near Lambeau field and had a bit part as a talent scout.

Neuhaus' father was a minister and his mother was a teacher he said in an interview with the Red Jacket Society a group of supporters of educational non-profit City Year. He described his upbringing as ""middle class"" and said he relied on scholarships for much of his education. Neuhaus attended the prestigious Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire as well as the University of California at Berkeley.

According to Neuhaus's LinkedIn profile he interned at the White House and for then-Democratic Congressman Mel Levine from California during two summers as an undergraduate. After graduating from UC Berkeley with a degree in political science in 1995 he went into consulting spending two years at Deloitte and three at Washington D.C.-based firm Westchester Consulting Group.

He joined Merrill Lynch in 2002 where he worked with Musk's future right-hand man

After getting an MBA from Northwestern University in 2002 Neuhaus joined Merrill Lynch's private-banking-and-investment group at the bank's downtown Los Angeles office in Century City. The division referred to as PBIG catered to clients with at least $10 million in assets.

He worked under Malone who had been a high-net-worth wealth manager at Goldman Sachs in New York. Malone had decamped two years earlier from Goldman with a team that included Birchall according to three former colleagues.

In 2006 Malone and Neuhaus left Merrill Lynch for Morgan Stanley. At the time they had $3 million in trailing-12-month commissions combined according to trade publication On Wall Street. Birchall later joined their team in 2010 after being discharged from Merrill Lynch for unspecified reasons. The bank alleged that Birchall had engaged in ""conduct resulting in management's loss of confidence including sending correspondence to a client without management approval"" and declined to clarify the cause to Insider.

It is unclear if Musk became a client of Malone and Neuhaus while they were at Merrill Lynch. But by 2011 Musk was taking out loans with Morgan Stanley that were secured by his Tesla stock in order to finance his lifestyle without selling his equity. In December 2018 Musk took out $61 million in mortgages on five properties in California all with Morgan Stanley according to recorded deeds. As of February 12 2020 his outstanding balance with the bank was $304 million per an SEC filing by Tesla.

Musk's family office head is still in Morgan Stanley's corner

Birchall left Morgan Stanley in 2016 to run Musk's family office Excession LLC but he still goes to bat for the bank. For instance when Musk was considering taking Tesla private Birchall advocated that he include Morgan Stanley alongside Goldman Sachs in the transaction as shown by recently unsealed court documents from a class-action lawsuit.

In a text to Musk he stressed that Morgan Stanley had gone above and beyond for Musk in the past providing his largest personal line of credit letters of credit and guarantee at ""little to no charge"" as well as free work for The Boring Company.

""They expect GS to be heavily involved but they hope to be recognized for being a strong resource for Tesla and for you personally over the years"" Birchall wrote. ""They've been our best resource on the personal side by far.""

The transaction went nowhere but Morgan Stanley was hired as an advisor according to Bloomberg.

When Musk requested in April that Morgan Stanley arrange billions of dollars in debt financing in under a week to buy Twitter the bank rose to the challenge for the longtime client.

The relationship goes both ways as Birchall's eldest son Benjamin interned for Malone and Neuhaus last summer according to the Brigham Young student's LinkedIn profile.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhc3Rjb21wYW55LmNvbS85MDc4Nzk1MC9zZWUtbW9yZ2FuLXN0YW5sZXlzLWZpcnN0LWV2ZXItZmFzaGlvbi1jb2xsYWItYS1iYW5rZXItYmFnLWZyb20tZGVzaWduZXItcmViZWNjYS1taW5rb2ZmL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,See Morgan Stanley's first-ever fashion collab—a banker bag from designer Rebecca Minkoff,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.fastcompany.com/90787950/see-morgan-stanleys-first-ever-fashion-collab-a-banker-bag-from-designer-rebecca-minkoff/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhc3Rjb21wYW55LmNvbS85MDc4Nzk1MC9zZWUtbW9yZ2FuLXN0YW5sZXlzLWZpcnN0LWV2ZXItZmFzaGlvbi1jb2xsYWItYS1iYW5rZXItYmFnLWZyb20tZGVzaWduZXItcmViZWNjYS1taW5rb2ZmL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFkdmlzb3JodWIuY29tL21lcnJpbGwtdGVhbXMtd2l0aC0xLWJsbi1qdW1wLXRvLXNhbmN0dWFyeS0zMzAtbWxuLW1vcmdhbi1zdGFubGV5LXRlYW0tc2lnbnMtd2l0aC1maW5ldC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merrill Teams With $1 Bln Jump to Sanctuary $330-Mln Morgan Stanley Team Signs with FiNet,"The breakaway movement holds strong as two teams Merrill Lynch teams and another from Morgan Stanley have left to launch practices affiliated with Sanctuary Wealth and and Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network.

“As an independent firm we will now sit on the same side of the table with our clients and have the ability to provide truly objective advice as our only goal is adding value to each client’s financial future” Mittman who spent the last 14 years of his 24-year career at Merrill said in a release.

McKelvy had spent all of his 23-year career at Merrill and said in a statement the team opted to affiliate with a broker-dealer rather than set up their own independent advisory firm because they did not want the additional responsibility of handling compliance and technology “that were outside of our comfort zone.”

Schellenberg started at Coastline Financial a firm that was later expelled from the industry in 1993 and shifted almost four years later to Merrill.

The group includes three other brokers—Jeffrey A. Dewees Arman Melikian and Jay Tamkoc—who are partners in Auric as well as support staff Anna T. Walters Kristen

Freeman Meghan Ide John Kincannon and Francine England.

Sanctuary Wealth which launched in 2018 has around $25 billion assets under management and over 70 partner firms. It is majority owned by Italian asset manager Azimut Group.

In a similar move last week a $600 million-asset Merrill team with offices in California and Georgia left to join independent broker-dealer LPL Financial although its advisors signed with LPL’s nascent employee-broker unit.

Separately a Scottsdale Arizona broker managing $330 million in client assets has left Morgan Stanley to go independent via a fast-growing Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network team on the West Coast a Wells spokeswoman confirmed.

Justin W. Breece a 19-year industry veteran who spent the last decade at Morgan Stanley joined Long Beach California-based TSG Wealth Management on September 1 according to registration records and an announcement on TSG’s website. His practice which includes two client associates and is dubbed Breece Private Wealth Management is opening TSG’s first Arizona office according to TSG’s website.

Breece who ranked 18th on Forbes’ 2022 list of best-in-state wealth advisors had generated roughly $3.4 million in annual revenue at his former firm according to the Wells spokeswoman. The broker did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“It became profoundly apparent that our team needed to control our destiny” Breece had said in a statement in TSG’s announcement.

A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman declined to comment.

Breece started at Crown Capital Advisors in 2003 moved to Merrill Lynch in 2005 and to UBS Wealth Management USA in 2008 before joining Morgan Stanley in 2013 according to his clean BrokerCheck report. Crown Capital was founded by his father R. William Breece Jr. in 1985 according to a previous news report.

TSG partner Allen Schreiber said in a statement that the Breece team’s addition marked an opportunity to extend “complex solutions and white glove service” to the “ever increasing” Phoenix and Scottsdale markets. He also touted TSG’s “ability to offer a higher payout” and said the independent pitch would help them recruit other brokers to grow their practice.

In October 2019 TSG whose 14 advisors had managed $4 billion in client assets joined FiNet after ten years in Wells’ private client group of brokers. The firm has since swelled to 40 advisors (including Breece) managing roughly $6 billion according to the Wells spokeswoman.

Wells has been heavily promoting its independent FiNet channel as well as a registered investment advisor custody option that it says could appeal to breakaways from competitors and restless brokers in its own employee channel.

Around 1200 of Wells’ roughly 12000 brokers are in the FiNet unit."

And with an endless amount of shapes patterns and materials on the market there’s something to suit every style.

DOJ attorney Kenneth Dintzer didn’t disclose how much Google spends to be the default search engine on most browsers and all US mobile phones but described the payments as “enormous numbers.”

“Google invests billions in defaults knowing people won’t change them” Dintzer told Judge Amit Mehta during a hearing in Washington that marked the first major face-off in the case and drew top DOJ antitrust officials and Nebraska’s attorney general among the spectators. “They are buying default exclusivity because defaults matter a lot.”

Google’s contracts form the basis of the DOJ’s landmark antitrust lawsuit which alleges the company has sought to maintain its online search monopoly in violation of antitrust laws. State attorneys general are pursuing a parallel antitrust suit against the search giant also pending before Mehta.

A trial isn’t expected to start formally until next year but Thursday’s hearing was the first substantive one in the case -- a daylong tutorial where each side laid out its views on Google’s business.

ReinING in the power of the tech giants

The Google antitrust suit filed in the waning days of the Trump administration was the federal government’s first major effort to rein in the power of the tech giants which continues under President Joe Biden. The White House Thursday hosted a roundtable with experts to explore the harm major tech platforms can wreak on the economy and children’s health.

Google’s attorney John Schmidtlein said the DOJ and states misunderstand the market and focus too narrowly on smaller search engine rivals like Microsoft Corp.’s Bing and DuckDuckGo. Instead Google faces competition from dozens of other companies he said including ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok Meta Platforms Inc. Amazon.com Inc. Grubhub Inc. and additional sites sites where consumers go to search for information.

‘Doesn’t mean the company doesn’t face tough competition’

“You don’t have to go to Google to shop on Amazon. You don’t have to go to Google to buy plane tickets on Expedia” he said. “The fact that Google doesn’t face the same competition on every query doesn’t mean the company doesn’t face tough competition.”

Having fresh data on user search queries is key to a search engine’s success lawyers for DOJ the states and Google all agreed. Google controls the most popular browser Chrome and the second-most popular mobile operating system Android.

In his presentation DOJ’s Dintzer focused on the mechanics of Google’s search engine and how its default contracts have hemmed in potential rivals. On mobile Google contracts with Apple smartphone makers like Samsung and Motorola Solutions Inc. most browsers and the three US telecom carriers -- AT&T Inc. Verizon Communications Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc. -- to ensure its search engine is set as the default and comes preinstalled on new phones Dintzer said. Microsoft’s search engine Bing is the default on the company’s Edge browser and Amazon’s Fire tablets he said.

Google’s contracts make it the “gateway” by which most people find websites on the internet which has allowed it to prevent rivals from gaining the scale that would be needed to challenge its search engine Dintzer said.

“Default exclusivity allows Google to systemically deny rivals’ data” he said.

Contracts with other tech giants

Google’s Schmidtlein said the company has contracted with Apple and browsers like Mozilla since the early 2000s. DOJ and the states haven’t explained why those deals are now problems he said. The revenue-sharing deals that Google offers to browsers are essential to companies like Mozilla Corp. he said because they offer their products to users for free.

“The reason they partner with Google isn’t because they had to; it’s because they want to” Schmidtlein said. The company “had extraordinary success and was doing something incredibly valuable. Competition on the merits is not unlawful.”

MSCI,MSCI,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vY2Euc3R5bGUueWFob28uY29tL2ZpbmFuY2UvbmV3cy9jcnlwdG8tcC01MDAtY29pbmRlc2stdW52ZWlscy0xMjA1MjM0MTguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Crypto's S&P 500: CoinDesk Unveils Broad-Market Digital-Asset Index,"CoinDesk on Friday unveiled a new index of digital-asset prices saying it hopes the broad gauge of crypto markets could become an industry benchmark similar to the stock market’s Dow Jones Industrial Average or Standard & Poor’s 500.

The CoinDesk Market Index initially consists of 148 digital tokens said Jodie Gunzberg managing director for CoinDesk Indices. To be included each token must have a pricing history from at least two eligible exchanges going back at least 30 days.

“It’s meant to be as inclusive as possible” Gunzberg said in an interview. “We’re just trying to represent the market.”

The new index joins a growing field of competitors aiming to meet demand from investors and traders for ways to measure the crypto market’s performance. Other providers include Bloomberg Galaxy CF Benchmarks (part of the Kraken exchange) Nasdaq Solactive MarketVector MSCI and S&P.

Traders and money managers use price indexes to evaluate whether they are beating – or getting beaten by – the market. Asset-management companies build investment funds based on indexes; big firms like State Street and BlackRock have built huge businesses selling exchange-traded stock funds based on the S&P 500 Nasdaq Composite and other indexes including for bond and commodity prices.

Customers “would be anybody who’s looking for benchmarking” Gunzberg said. “That could be people who are looking at measuring performance generating investment ideas looking for ways to manage risk peer group evaluations.”

CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index

CoinDesk’s new index builds on the early success of its Bitcoin Price Index which the media company added via its 2021 acquisition of TradeBlock a data and trading platform. (TradeBlock’s operations outside of its index business were spun out of CoinDesk earlier this year Gunzberg said.)

The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index – often referred to by its ticker XBX – is the basis for price charts on the CoinDesk website and it underpins the price-setting mechanisms for at least two big investment funds the $12.1 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and the roughly $500 million Purpose Bitcoin ETF.

CoinDesk management hopes that licensing fees from the growing index business could become a key source of revenue alongside advertising sponsorship sales and crypto conferences especially the flagship Consensus franchise. (CoinDesk is an independent subsidiary of Digital Currency Group the crypto-focused conglomerate that also owns Grayscale and TradeBlock.)

Gunzberg who joined CoinDesk in 2021 from Morgan Stanley said that a key differentiator for the CoinDesk Market Index or CMI is that it’s the first in a “family” of nine indexes built around the company’s proprietary classification system for cryptocurrencies known as the CoinDesk Digital Asset Classification Standard or DACS.

Crypto taxonomy

The DACS divides about 500 of the biggest digital assets into six categories: currency smart-contract platform DeFi (decentralized finance) culture & entertainment computing and digitization.

So the broad CoinDesk Market Index will come with six sub-indexes corresponding to each of the DACS categories. Two more sub-indexes will strip out stablecoins “so you can get the full effect of the volatility” of cryptocurrencies that aren’t pegged to government-issued currencies Gunzberg said. Prior to her stint at Morgan Stanley Gunzberg was a managing director at S&P Dow Jones Indices.

“What really makes this launch unique is the family of indices representing not just the broad market but the sectors” she said. “The first question might be 'Is the market up or down today?' You might look at the broad market index for the answer. But then you ask ‘Why what drove it?’”

The CMI index will be weighted by market capitalization which means that at least initially it’s heavily skewed toward bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) the two biggest cryptocurrencies.

The index will be rebalanced monthly on the second business day of the month and the number of assets is expected to expand beyond the initial 148 Gunzberg said. The pricing history for the index dates back to Aug. 29 an admittedly short time frame that will also increase “as time passes” she said.

“That 148 is not a fixed number” Gunzberg said. “That number is a result of the methodology. I would expect that to grow as the market grows.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzQ3MzI5OTVmLWJmNDQtNDEzOC05YjZhLTc4N2QxMDQ4YmE0MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can India become the new emerging markets powerhouse?,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

The five-year bond priced at a spread of 115 basis points above treasuries with a 4.5 per cent coupon rate was 3.8 times oversubscribed after attracting a range of local regional and international investors that placed total orders of over $1.9bn.

The strong investor demand follows a global roadshow and reflects confidence in ADCB and its approach to managing ESG risks and opportunities according to a report published by the state news agency WAM.

The bank has aligned its sustainability approach to the UAE’s ambitions for an inclusive net-zero economy. Commitments include providing Dhs35bn in green finance by 2030 reaching net-zero in the bank’s own operations and reducing financed emissions in line with UAE government net-zero ambitions.

The bank has adopted a ‘Green Bond Framework’ to provide a long-term platform to support further mobilisation of capital for green projects.

The favourable pricing for ADCB’s green bond was supported by its credit ratings of A/Stable/A-1 from S&P and A+/Stable/F1 from Fitch.

MSCI has assigned an ‘AA’ rating for ESG while the bank is categorised as ‘Medium risk’ by Sustainalytics.

The proceeds of the bond issuance will further support financing of a low-carbon economy in line with criteria set out in the framework. Initiatives eligible for green loans include projects or companies associated with renewable energy green buildings sustainable water and wastewater treatment clean transportation energy efficiency pollution prevention and control.

The framework which aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and based on the International Capital Markets Association (ICMA) Green Bond Principles is governed by a cross-functional Green Bond Working Group reporting to an executive-level Sustainability Committee.

ADCB has also obtained a ‘Second Party Opinion’ to externally verify the sustainability quality of the framework and alignment with ‘Green Bond Principles’.

The electric vehicle maker was backed by Amazon and Ford Motor Company which seemed to give it much brighter prospects than many of its industry peers.

But today Rivian's stock trades nearly 60% below its IPO price. The market's enthusiasm for Rivian waned as it struggled with production delays supply chain disruptions and widening losses. Rising interest rates exacerbated that pain.

Tesla also struggled to ramp up its production for years before it achieved mainstream success. But once it did its market cap soared from less than $3 billion at the beginning of 2012 to nearly $850 billion today. Could Rivian which is worth $28 billion today replicate that success story and catch up to Tesla by 2030?

The differences between Rivian and Tesla

Rivian produces three types of EVs: the R1T pickup truck the R1S SUV and Amazon's EDV (electric delivery van). Its R1 vehicles start at under $70000 and can travel more than 300 miles on a single charge. It doesn't manufacture any electric sedans like Tesla does. However Tesla also launched its own electric SUV the Model X back in 2015. It also plans to launch its long-awaited Cybertruck next year followed by a ""configurable robovan"" for cargo and passengers in the future.

Amazon has already ordered 100000 of Rivian's EDVs which can travel about 150 miles on a single charge to be delivered by 2030. Rivian has also received about 98000 preorders for its R1 vehicles as of June 30.

Rivian originally planned to ship 50000 vehicles this year but it reduced that target to 25000 vehicles back in March as it struggled with supply chain issues. As of June 30 it's only manufactured about 9000 vehicles. By comparison Tesla's annual deliveries skyrocketed from 22477 vehicles in 2013 to 936172 vehicles in 2021.

Could Rivian become as big as Tesla?

Tesla's plants in California Texas Germany and China have a combined annual production capacity for over 1.9 million vehicles. Rivian currently has an annual production capacity of 150000 vehicles at its main plant in Illinois. It expects the expansion of its Illinois plant to boost its annual capacity to 200000 vehicles next year.

In 2024 Rivian plans to open its second plant in Georgia. After it fully expands its Illinois plant and opens its Georgia plant it expects its annual production capacity to reach 600000 vehicles -- but it hasn't set a firm deadline for reaching that milestone yet. Therefore Rivian will still likely be much smaller than Tesla by the end of the decade.

But how much smaller will Rivian be?

Assuming Rivian sticks to its current production targets and ramps up its production over the next few years analysts expect its revenue to rise from just $55 million in 2021 to $12.4 billion in 2024. Based on its average sticker price of about $70000 per vehicle those estimates imply that Rivian can deliver nearly 180000 vehicles in 2024.

That would be comparable to Tesla's $11.8 billion in revenue in 2017 which subsequently grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 46% to $53.8 billion in 2021. If Rivian matches analysts' expectations and replicates Tesla's 2017-2021 growth trajectory from 2024 to 2028 it could potentially generate over $56 billion in revenue by the final year. If it grows its revenue at more than 30% over the following two years it could generate nearly $100 billion in revenue in 2030.

Rivian currently trades at 16 times this year's sales while Tesla trades at 10 times this year's sales. If Rivian generates $100 billion in revenue in 2030 and trades at 10 times sales its market cap could cross the $1 trillion mark -- as Tesla's initially did last October. However that's a rosy best-case scenario that assumes everything goes perfectly for Rivian.

In reality Rivian could struggle to grow as rapidly as Tesla for two simple reasons. First the EV market is much more saturated today than it was during Tesla's meteoric rise. In addition to Tesla's Model X upcoming Cybertruck and future robovans Rivian still needs to deal with other electric van makers like Stellantis formerly known as Fiat Chrysler and smaller electric delivery vehicle makers like Canoo which recently secured a big order from Walmart.

Second big government subsidies favorable loans and tax breaks offset a lot of Tesla's early losses -- but Rivian and other smaller EV makers could struggle to secure the same benefits. Analysts expect Rivian to continue to lose billions of dollars every year for the foreseeable future -- so it could run out of cash before it successfully ramps up its production.

Don't call Rivian the next Tesla yet

Rivian is doing a lot better than many of its fellow EV makers like Canoo or Faraday Future Intelligent Electric -- neither of which has shipped a single vehicle yet -- but it certainly hasn't proven that it's the ""next Tesla"" yet. Rivian might become nearly as large as today's Tesla by the end of 2030 if it plays all its cards right but it's still a very speculative stock.

More content all the time

With exception of only a few shows like ""Better Call Saul"" ""Stranger Things"" or ""The Ozark"" Netflix has uploaded all the content available for people to enjoy their favorite shows whenever they like however due to the change in audience acceptance it will pivot to a new model.

The Squid Game was the exception to the rule

Shows like ""The Squid Game"" or others have been the exception of upload and maintenance so that is what Netflix wants to avoid the ""here today gone tomorrow"" scenario with its series like ""The Sandman"" and ""The Witcher"" that have been very expensive to make and due to having all the content where the audience does not watch it all in one sitting so it creates an anti-climatic scenario.

Goaso (A/R) Sept. 9 GNA – Newmont Ghana Gold Limited has released GH¢1 million to offer employable skills training for the youth as the company finalises plans to begin actual mining in its Ahafo North concessional area.

Mr George Boakye the Ahafo Regional Minister who disclosed this said the six politically- administrative districts and municipalities in the region would facilitate the training programme.

He said the programme would benefit 1200 people who would be trained in welding and fabrication dressmaking and hairdressing as well as pedicure manicure and others.

Mr Boakye announced during an interaction with Mr Sulemanu Koney the Chief Executive Officer of the Ghana Chamber of Mines at a meeting at Goaso the regional capital.

Accompanied by some members of the Journalists for Business Advocacy (JBA) Mr Koney is on a two-day visit to the region to assess the operations of the Newmont Ahafo North and South Mines in the Asutifi North District and Tano North Municipality of the region.

Mr Boakye indicated the Ahafo Regional Coordinating Council (ARCC) had prioritised local content explaining that the skills training programme would create an opportunity for the company to engage some of the beneficiaries for basic jobs.

As a new region he said Ahafo was bedevilled with several development challenges and expressed the hope that the operations of the Newmont Ahafo North and Ahafo South Mines would not only create jobs for the people but also open up the region and attract investors.

He gave the assurance that the RCC would continue to introduce measures to strengthen security in the region and create a peaceful atmosphere for the Mine’s operations.

That notwithstanding Mr Boakye added “my outfit would not also sit unconcerned for the company to cheat my people particularly in the payment of compensation”.

He cited the Newmont Ahafo North Mine had enrolled 30 women at Susuanso in an apprenticeship programme and were learning to sew the official attire of the company indicating that the company was also asphalting the 8.2-kilometre Kenyasi-Hwidiem road at the cost of GH¢71 million.

On his part Mr Koney thanked the Regional Minister for building and deepening a relationship with the company saying as a new region “the development of Ahafo is tied to the development of Newmont”.

He said a harmonious and healthy relationship between the Mine and the locals would push economic development and attract investors into the region too.

Mr Koney said as one of the bread baskets of the region there was a need for Ahafo to position itself well to meet the demands of the Mine saying that would enhance the livelihoods of the people.

Insecurity and threats of security in local communities he added remained the bane of mining companies in the country and called on the RCC to improve security in the region and also protect the Mine.

The Ahafo North Project of Newmont Ghana Gold Limited expected to rake in 350000 ounces of gold per year to boost the local economy is having a dwindling start.

Lands for the Ahafo North project of Newmont Ghana Gold Limited were declared a mining area in September 2017.

But the erection of unauthorized structures on the concession has since stalled commencement of construction works after receipt of an initial investment capital of 850 million dollars in 2021.

Engulfed by the hushed and greenery scenery at Tano North sits thousands of the speculative structures made from metallic roofing sheets.

An aerial view reveals the structures including fishponds dotted across five communities within the concession including Yamfo Afrisipa Terchire Susuanso and Adrobaa.

The illegal structures numbering over 9000 however do not serve as a home or sleeping place for their owners but an abode for weeds sprouting from the fertile ground.

As these speculative structures continue to spring up their owners anticipate huge compensations a lasting attitude actors in the mining industry are displeased with.

Speaking with Journalists for Business Advocacy CEO of the Ghana Chamber of Mines Sulemanu Koney was worried the perennial attitude could hamper investments in the mining industry.

“The resources belong to us. We should practically own it and put our hearts to it. We need to extract the resources optimally and with situations like this before the investments comes it’s not the very best. My heart actually breaks to see the extent of these speculative structures” he said.

The Ahafo North project is expected to produce 3.3 million ounces of gold over its 13-year mine life with numerous job opportunities for the indigenes.

The construction period for the project presents 1800 employments with about 550 direct job offers when the gold mine begins its operations.

The project would also provide training and skills development opportunities for the youth in the communities.

Manager Communications and External Relations of Newmont Ahafo Mine Samuel Osei impressed on the profound revenue generation prospects the project would contribute to the Ghanaian economy.

“The Ahafo North project presents a lot of prospects for the Ghanaian economy. Contractors who will also be employed may have more employees than what we have so this project presents a lot of employment opportunities for the people. Lot of opportunities in the local procurement. For the general economy we have enhanced taxes and royalties that will come to the local economy” he said.

Following a stakeholder engagement meeting with the government Newmont Ahafo mine agreed to disburse a relief support worth 45 million Ghana cedis to owners of the unauthorized structures in the five communities.

The payment which commenced in August 2022 has since seen over 1400 of the 4300 owners receiving payments.

Coordinator for the Ahafo North Relief Support Sylvester Amankwah-Koranteng anticipates a speedy disbursement to initiate processes for the functioning of the mine.

“In terms of cash we have a little over 23000 Ghana cedis. We have about 9791 structures in the data that we are using for repaying but about 90 of them do not have codes. Out of this 9000 we’ve validated about 7000 of them. These structures we are paying include hen coops and the usual village kind of washroom” he said.

Meanwhile the mining company is yet to commence compensations for legal occupants of structures on the mining concession with resettlement negotiations ongoing.

Crop compensations however commenced in 2021.

Community leader Charles Bright Boachie is satisfied with the smooth disbursement of the relief support.

“We started very slowly but after that when the education went round people are now coming. People have understood the situation and they are ready to receive their monies. The payment process is going on” he said.

Though NGGL is ready to invest initial amount of US$850 million dollars into the mine management of the Ahafo North project has suspended actual construction works expected to be completed within two years due to difficulties in land access and illegal structures on the concession.

Already the world’s mining giant has secured environmental permit from the Environmental Protection Agency but illegal activities had slowed down construction works thereby denying the nation the optimum benefits of actual mining.

According to the company the Ahafo North project is expected to mine about 3.3 million ounces of gold in the area for a period of 13 years which would improve the nation’s mining revenue and facilitate accelerated national development.

During a visit to the project enclave several illegal structures including fish ponds thatched and block buildings were sighted on the company’s concessional area covering five local communities of Terchire Afrisipakrom Susuanso Yamfo and Adrobaa.

The Ghana News Agency (GNA) gathered some residents and other farmers around the enclave took advantage of the Ahafo project to cash in and thus put up the illegal structures to obtain compensation as the company undertakes main construction works.

According to some resident farmers in the area the expectant owners of the illegal structures in the local communities are however. irritated due to the delays in the execution of the project.

This is because they had invested hugely in undertaking the speculative activities which would probably yield the required or expected returns.

Speaking in an interview with the GNA Mr Richard Yeboah the Youth Chairman of Terchire one of the project’s affected communities condemned such illegal activities saying the situation had not only slowed down payment of compensation to the genuine farmers and property owners but also the project commencement as well.

“I think the current situation is very bad and highly condemnable. Even people from elsewhere have taking advantage of the mine negotiated with farmers and constructed several structures here and other localities to obtain undue compensation” he stated.

But Mr Samuel Osei the Communications and External Affairs Manager Newmont Ahafo North Project and Newmont Ahafo South Mine said the company had GHC45 million and was paying a ‘relief support package’ for the owners of the illegal structures.

Though structures on the concession are illegal Mr Osei explained payment of the package was to relief the illegal property owners of some level of financial stress and also to pave the way for the company to demolish the structures.

Mr Osei told reporters when he conducted Dr Sulemanu Koney the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Ghana Chamber of Mines round the Ahafo North mine concession at Terchire that the company was expected to demolish about 9721 illegal structures on the concession.

Accompanied by some members of the Journalists for Business Advocacy (JBA) Dr. Koney and other key staff of the Chamber the tour on the company’s concessions was to round up his two-day visit to acquaint himself with the operations of the Mine.

Earlier Dr. Koney paid a courtesy call and interacted with Mr George Boakye the Ahafo Regional Minister at Goaso the regional capital and later visited the company’s Ahafo South plant site where he held close door discussions with some key staff of the Mine.

Mr. Osei explained in 2017 the company declared the enclave a mining area which meant that nobody had the right to put up any structure on the concession while the company finalised modalities to pay compensation on existing structures.

In that regard he explained the company posted notices in the affected communities but added that some of the residents ignored and engaged in the speculative activities on the mine’s concession.

He therefore expressed the hope that communities around the mine would cooperate with the company for construction work to begin to pave the way for actual mining.

Mr. Sylvester Amankwaa Koranteng the Coordinator of the Ahafo North Relief Support Secretariat an inter-governmental agency set up to facilitate the payment of the relief package to the farmers said GHC23 million had so far been paid for 1400 of the illegal structures.

So far the highest beneficiary received GHC335505 and the lowest GHC28000 depending on values of the structures.

The agency comprised representatives of the government Newmont Ahafo North project Ahafo Regional Coordinating Council and the local communities.

Mr. Koranteng said though majority of beneficiaries were cooperating few of them had rejected because they were not satisfied.

On his part Dr. Koney lauded Newmont for taking the decision to alleviate the plight of the people saying that would greatly help build cordial relationship with the local people and create peaceful atmosphere for the mine to operate in the area.

He expressed regret that speculative activities in mining areas were hampering mining investment in the country and called for concerted efforts to control the appalling practices.

Dr. Koney indicated the benefits of mining outweighed the negative saying the commencement of the Ahafo North project would make the Ahafo region a mining hub that would not only open but also attract international and local investors into the area to spur rapid socio-economic growth.

He therefore entreated the local communities to build and deepen friendly relationships with the company for the nation to get optimum benefit from the Mine.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c2doYW5hLmNvbS5naC9uZXdtb250LWxhdWRlZC1mb3ItYXNwaGFsdGluZy1rZW55YXNpLWh3aWRpZW0tcm9hZC_SAUxodHRwczovL25ld3NnaGFuYS5jb20uZ2gvbmV3bW9udC1sYXVkZWQtZm9yLWFzcGhhbHRpbmcta2VueWFzaS1od2lkaWVtLXJvYWQv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Newmont lauded for asphalting Kenyasi-Hwidiem road,"The Ghana Chamber of Mines has lauded Newmont Ghana Gold Limited for taking the lead in the development of communities within its Ahafo North and South Mines in the Ahafo Region.

Mr. Sulemanu Koney the Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber gave the commendation when he paid a working visit to the mine’s operational enclave at Kenyasi in the Asutifi North District.

The mining company is funding the construction of the 8.2 kilometre Kenyasi-Hwidiem road at the cost of GHS71 million.

During an inspection Mr Koney noted the project would not only open the area but also strengthen the relations between the mine and the people and applauded the company for the road and other development projects in the area.

Accompanied by some members of the Journalists for Business Advocacy (JBA) Mr. Koney is on a two-day working visit to acquaint himself with the operations of the Mine.

The CNN Original Series airs Sundays at 10 p.m. ET.

CNN —

“Succession” drops viewers into the high-stakes world of running a media empire and all the top-secret deals attempted coups and shocking scandals that comes with it.

The actors and creators of the award-winning series which will compete for more statues at Monday’s Emmy Awards insist that the characters are inspired by a long list of family-run dynastic enterprises – both past and present. Showrunner Jesse Armstrong said in one behind-the-scenes interview that the writers pulled from “famous media families like the Hearsts to modern-day Redstone John Malone Robert Fitz of Comcast Murdoch and Robert and Rebekah Mercer who founded Breitbart.”

But of all the influences the fictional Roys led by patriarch Logan Roy (Brian Cox) who plays the CEO of media company and entertainment conglomerate Waystar Royco seem to overlap most with the real-life Murdochs the family of Australian media mogul Rupert Murdoch.

Here’s why:

The premise of the series which airs on HBO which like CNN is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery is practically ripped from the Murdoch playbook.

Logan Roy a ruthless dealmaker and a friend of presidents certainly possesses a Murdoch-ian vibe.

Rupert Murdoch grew the small newspaper company that he inherited from his father in 1952 into one of the most powerful conservative media empires in history. News Corp with a market cap of $13.50 billion is one of the most influential companies on the planet.

He always intended to pass down his company to one of his children but the 91-year-old has never named a successor.

Family structure

Like Roy Murdoch has several children from two marriages.

Prudence Macleod is Rupert’s oldest child from his first marriage. Prudence never showed much of an interest in running the family business so she has largely stayed out of the succession battle that ensnares her siblings.

Rupert Murdoch’s oldest son from his second marriage is Lachlan Murdoch who rose quickly through the ranks and became chairman and chief executive of News Ltd in 1997.

At the time his father described Lachlan as his heir apparent “the first among equals.” Then in 2005 he abruptly quit after a battle with Fox News Channel CEO Roger Ailes over the direction of the cable news network – effectively taking himself off the heir apparent track. Lachlan returned to the family business in 2014.

The family also includes Rupert Murdoch’s youngest son James Murdoch who dropped out of Harvard in 1995 to start his own hip-hop record label.

James Murdoch joined News Corporation and was increasingly seen as the new heir apparent after Lachlan Murdoch quit in 2005. But he stepped down in 2011 after he was engulfed in a phone hacking scandal. After several years of hiatus he rejoined the family business before ultimately resigned in 2020 citing “disagreements over certain editorial content published by the Company’s news outlets and certain other strategic decisions.”

Elisabeth Murdoch is the only daughter of their father’s second marriage.

“She’s very savvy very cunning. She is perhaps the most like Rupert” New York Times writer Jim Rutenberg says of Elisabeth in the new CNN Original Series “The Murdochs: Empire of Influence” which premieres on CNN September 25 at 9 p.m. ET.

Rupert Murdoch has been dismissive of her attempts to take the throne saying she needs to figure out how many children she wanted to have before planning further advancement at the company Sky High author Mathew Horsman said in the series.

In 2000 she left the family business and founded one of the UK’s biggest independent production companies.

On “Succession” Logan Roy has four children. Eldest Connor Roy (Alan Ruck) is mostly removed from the business and in the most recent season set his eyes on the presidency. Kendall Roy (Jeremy Strong) initially sits as the ostensible heir apparent to his father but after a series of blows he falls from his father’s graces.

Roy family youngest quick-witted Roman Roy (Kieran Culkin) has had a hard time proving himself worthy of the top spot. Sarah Snook’s Siobhan (or Shiv) meanwhile has the skills and her father’s favor (even when they’re at bitter odds) but has been met resistance.

The media empire and network

“Succession’s” Waystar Royco and the Murdoch’s News Corp. have more than a few points of overlap.

On “Succession” Waystar Royco’s assets include conservative cable news network ATN the show’s version of Fox News.

Throughout the series Logan Roy speaks with the president and his advisers about the network’s coverage of the White House and flexes their access.

Fox News is a tool of influence for Rupert Murdoch Jonathan Mahler who co-wrote “How Rupert Murdoch’s Empire of Influence Remade the World” says in “The Murdochs: Empire of Influence.”

“Rupert had always fantasized about having a close relationship with an American President” says Mahler.

Major scandal

In Season 2 of “Succession” news leaks that Waystar’s cruise ship division buried internal reports of sexual harassment assault and possibly murder. The scandal forced Logan Roy and his son Kendall Roy to testify before a US senate subcommittee – another strike in Kendall’s pursuit of power.

The debacle shares similarities with the News Corp.’s hacking scandal in 2011. The company’s British newspaper News of the World came under scrutiny when it was discovered reporters were hacking the phones of royals celebrities and crime victims to get their stories. Like a mirror image of the show Rupert Murdoch alongside his son James testified before Parliament’s Culture Media and Sport Committee.

In the fallout James gave up his title as executive chairman of News Corp’s UK publishing unit.

“You would imagine in a situation like this a father’s instinct might be to protect his son but James is really thrown under the bus by his father” said Mahler. “It’s a humiliating and devastating period for him.”

Selling off the empire

Both Rupert and Logan pulled off a move that left people stunned: Selling off their self-made empires.

In the finale of Season 3 Logan announces his plan to sell Waystar Royco to streaming company GoJo and give tech founder Lukas Matsson control of the company.

“This is the best moment to sell. If I don’t do the best deal at any given point what’s the point of anything? I don’t get out I leave $5 billion on the table” Logan told his children. “Make your own pile. This is an opportunity for you kids to get an education in real life.”

Rupert also chose to cash out in 2018 selling off most of 21st Century Fox to Disney.

“Once the Disney deal closed Fox was left a shell of its former self. Gone was the movie studio gone was the cable networks like FX. What was left was the Fox Broadcasting Company Fox Sports and Fox News – the thing that Rupert cares about more than anything” Matthew Belloni former editorial director of The Hollywood Reporter and founding partner of Puck News says in the Murdoch series.

Rudenberg says this move was seen as a no-confidence vote in his children.

“By making his family the business and the business his family Rupert left his family just as broken up as his company was when he sold to Disney” said Rutenberg. “It was ripped apart by this decades-long battle for succession which at the same time was a zero-sum seeming battle for their father’s love.”

Today Lachlan Murdoch is the CEO of Fox Corp and his father serves as co-chairman. Both James and Elisabeth have left the family business.

The future of Logan’s children is very uncertain as the series heads into its fourth season.

Lachlan Murdoch who is executive chair and CEO took home a total pay package of $21.7 million down from $27.7 million in fiscal 2021.

On top of a base salary of $3 million the exec netted an $8.2 million stock award and $6.3 million through a non-equity incentive plan.

Rupert Murdoch Lachlan’s father and the company’s chair made $18.4 million a steep decline from his $31.1 million package in 2021. The main elements were $5 million in base salary a stock award of $5.1 million and $6.3 million via the company’s non-equity incentive plan.

Viet Dinh Fox’s chief legal and policy officer collected $11.2 million down from $12.4 million a year earlier. COO John Nallen got $10.2 million compared with $12.45 million. Steven Tomsic was paid a total of $6.1 million down from $7.5 million.

Along with disclosing executive compensation the company said in its proxy statement that it has set Nov. 3 as the date of its annual shareholder meeting.

Fox Corp. shares like those of many other media companies of late have been in a slump. They have slipped more than 10% in the past year and closed the week at $31.97 after a 3% uptick in today’s trading.

Since 2019 the Murdochs have led a slimmed-down Fox Corp. as a stand-alone entity after the family agreed to sell most of 21st Century Fox to Disney.

Rupert Murdoch Fox’s chairman received a pay package totaling $18.4 million last year. That was down from $31.1 million a year earlier. Similarly Lachlan Murdoch Fox’s executive chairman and CEO received a $21.7 million pay package down from $27.7 million a year earlier.

The declines were due in part to a reduction in non-equity incentive plan compensation for both Murdochs which went to $6.3 million down from $10.5 million in the prior year. It also reflected a change in value to pension and deferred compensation plans.

The pay packages were disclosed in a securities filing Friday. The filing also revealed that Lachlan Murdoch signed a contract extension in 2021 keeping him at the helm of the company through June 2026.

Other top Fox executives including CFO Steve Tomsic chief legal and policy officer Viet Dinh and COO John Nallen saw their compensation decline year over year.

Fox Corp. includes Fox News Media Fox Sports as well as the Fox broadcast network. Rupert Murdoch also serves as chairman of News Corp. which owns The Wall Street Journal. The company will hold its annual shareholder meeting on the Fox Lot in Los Angeles Nov. 3.

Here at Independent Australia we are no fans of the Murdoch media’s near monopoly of the Australian political landscape as can be seen by our fearless coverage for well over a decade.

In fact we published an entire series of articles from Rupert Murdoch's News Ltd lieutenant Rodney E Lever blowing apart the mythology that has grown up around the ageing tycoon. It’s fair to say we were speaking truth to Murdoch’s power well before it became cool as you can see HERE.

Long before Crikey decided to stick its head above the parapet and issue this challenge to Lachlan Murdoch Independent Australia was being mauled by Murdoch's minions. We were being attacked scorned and subjected to almost innumerable legal letters from News Corp practically all of which threatened our very continuation as a publication. That's because we were actually broke — not pretend poor like Crikey.

So while we support attempts to loosen the chokehold the Murdochs have over Australia’s media and political landscape we have some serious problems with Crikey’s recent well-publicised crowdfunding campaign some of which we discussed in an article last week.

That article raised several important questions and suggested many more. Such as why did Crikey represent itself as a ""small"" poorly funded ""minnow"" when it is in fact owned by millionaires and billionaires? Why did Crikey imply it is not mainstream when one of Crikey’s senior shareholders is a scion of arguably Australia's oldest media dynasty Fairfax Media and another an offshoot of a prominent Irish media conglomerate?

Why did those behind Crikey not disclose this information in their vast crowdfunding campaign which included a full-page advertisement in the New York Times? What sort of “minnow” can even afford such an advertisement? What has changed for Crikey which has previously excoriated other truly independent media outlets for crowdfunding defamation defences? And why does Crikey now contend that crowdfunding a defamation defence – for a lawsuit it openly provoked and is more than capable of self-funding – is acceptable?

This article will discuss those matters as well as the cold calculation which led to Crikey rekindling a case that had already been effectively resolved. Done it seems in order to lure the Murdochs into an expensive dispute that Crikey' could then use as a very profitable publicity stunt.

BEHIND CRIKEY’S CROWDFUNDING

In last week’s article we discussed Crikey’s humble origins as a small gossip newsletter before being purchased by multimillionaire Eric Beecher in 2005.

We then explained that since the buyout Crikey has amassed several wealthy investors — the most noteworthy being billionaire media mogul John B Fairfax who owns approximately 30 per cent of the company. Yet despite this Crikey has launched a crowdfunding campaign to support its defence against News Corp co-chairman Lachlan Murdoch's defamation lawsuit.

This lawsuit was filed after Crikey published an article suggesting the Murdochs conspired with Donald Trump to incite the 6 January 2021 United States Capitol attack. We noted that originally the offending article was removed 20 minutes after receiving the first concerns notice only to be republished a month later thus rekindling the matter. Crikey paid for a series of ads in the New York Times portraying themselves as the ""small independent"" poorly funded down-at-heel ""minnow"" standing up against the vast rich bullying behemoth. The only thing clearly true about all that rhetoric is that Crikey is small — as in not widely read.

The last article blew apart the myth of Crikey'slack of resources now let's focus on their claim of being “independent”.

CRIKEY ... “INDEPENDENT”?

Crikey's GoFundMe blurb mentions its battle against “billionaire” Lachlan Murdoch. But as we have seen Crikey is itself backed by a billionaire media tycoon John B Fairfax along with other multimillionaire media tycoons including chief executive Eric Beecher himself.

Fairfax Media figures prominently in the Crikey story. Fairfax had a significant stake in Beecher’s cash cow Text for several years before it acquired the rest in 2003.

Beecher is obviously a canny businessman because besides being chair of Crikey's parent company Private Media he is also the chair of Solstice Media the parent company of The New Daily. The New Daily which unlike Crikey has no paywall is funded by industry super funds. It was Beecher’s brainchild and is now vastly more popular and influential than Crikey. And it is run by his former colleague close friend and fellow Murdoch enemy Bruce Guthrie.

So Beecher seems highly proficient at attracting blue-chip media investment and placing his allies in positions of power. He has a knack for business — and there's nothing wrong with that. But he is also an insider – about as mainstream as you could possibly be – and so to call Crikey ""independent"" is laughable. Beecher flies mostly under the radar but he has an obviously close association with the big end of town. With a number of large institutional investors major financial interests high-profile identities – both inside and outside the media industry — along with outright media tycoons and dynasties.

That includes the Fairfax family for whom Beecher has worked in one way or another throughout his career. The Fairfax's have had their hooks into Australian news publishing since the 1840s and probably regard the Murdochs as vulgar upstart new money parvenus.

In 2017 Private Media sold a large stake in its business to billionaire JB Fairfax as well as Irish media tycoon Cameron O’Reilly. Fairfax currently owns about 30 per cent of Private Media and O'Reilly a lesser stake.

In 2019 the pair pumped additional millions into Crikey which allowed the publication to hire an additional dozen staff members.

Reflecting on this latest cash injection into Crikey JB Fairfax made some rather revealing remarks last year.

JB said a lot of his friends think Crikey is“far too left”:

We went to invest in Crikey and we were concerned about that because at the time Crikey – I don’t want to put [founder] Stephen Mayne down – but it didn’t have a great reputation. It’s changed altogether now under Eric Beecher and [editor-in-chief] Peter Fray. They’re doing a very good job there although a lot of my friends come up and say “it’s far too left”.

Crikey might become 'trustworthy and worthwhile' said JB generously but wasn't there yet:

“It’s on the road to doing a good job. It’s not there yet. But I think [it’s] an organ that might develop into a very trustworthy and worthwhile news operation.”

And what an organ it is! Maybe under the fatherly guiding hands of this billionaire member of the Bunyip aristocracy Crikey can become more worthwhile trustworthy and especially rightwing.

Send your meagre savings to small independent minnow Crikey fellow progressives. You know it makes sense.

In Season 2 of “Succession” news leaks that Waystar’s cruise ship division buried internal reports of sexual harassment assault and possibly murder. The scandal forced Logan Roy and his son Kendall Roy to testify before a US senate subcommittee – another strike in Kendall’s pursuit of power.

The debacle shares similarities with the News Corp.’s hacking scandal in 2011. The company’s British newspaper News of the World came under scrutiny when it was discovered reporters were hacking the phones of royals celebrities and crime victims to get their stories. Like a mirror image of the show Rupert Murdoch alongside his son James testified before Parliament’s Culture Media and Sport Committee.

In the fallout James gave up his title as executive chairman of News Corp’s UK publishing unit.

“You would imagine in a situation like this a father’s instinct might be to protect his son but James is really thrown under the bus by his father” said Mahler. “It’s a humiliating and devastating period for him.”

Selling off the empire

Both Rupert and Logan pulled off a move that left people stunned: Selling off their self-made empires.

In the finale of Season 3 Logan announces his plan to sell Waystar Royco to streaming company GoJo and give tech founder Lukas Matsson control of the company.

“This is the best moment to sell. If I don’t do the best deal at any given point what’s the point of anything? I don’t get out I leave $5 billion on the table” Logan told his children. “Make your own pile. This is an opportunity for you kids to get an education in real life.”

Rupert also chose to cash out in 2018 selling off most of 21st Century Fox to Disney.

“Once the Disney deal closed Fox was left a shell of its former self. Gone was the movie studio gone was the cable networks like FX. What was left was the Fox Broadcasting Company Fox Sports and Fox News – the thing that Rupert cares about more than anything” Matthew Belloni former editorial director of The Hollywood Reporter and founding partner of Puck News says in the Murdoch series.

Rudenberg says this move was seen as a no-confidence vote in his children.

“By making his family the business and the business his family Rupert left his family just as broken up as his company was when he sold to Disney” said Rutenberg. “It was ripped apart by this decades-long battle for succession which at the same time was a zero-sum seeming battle for their father’s love.”

Today Lachlan Murdoch is the CEO of Fox Corp and his father serves as co-chairman. Both James and Elisabeth have left the family business.

The future of Logan’s children is very uncertain as the series heads into its fourth season.

Pay Packages Decline In Fiscal 2022,"Total executive compensation declined for top executives at Fox Corp. in fiscal 2022 compared with a year earlier according to an SEC filing.

Lachlan Murdoch who is executive chair and CEO took home a total pay package of $21.7 million down from $27.7 million in fiscal 2021.

On top of a base salary of $3 million the exec netted an $8.2 million stock award and $6.3 million through a non-equity incentive plan.

Rupert Murdoch Lachlan’s father and the company’s chair made $18.4 million a steep decline from his $31.1 million package in 2021. The main elements were $5 million in base salary a stock award of $5.1 million and $6.3 million via the company’s non-equity incentive plan.

Viet Dinh Fox’s chief legal and policy officer collected $11.2 million down from $12.4 million a year earlier. COO John Nallen got $10.2 million compared with $12.45 million. Steven Tomsic was paid a total of $6.1 million down from $7.5 million.

Along with disclosing executive compensation the company said in its proxy statement that it has set Nov. 3 as the date of its annual shareholder meeting.

Fox Corp. shares like those of many other media companies of late have been in a slump. They have slipped more than 10% in the past year and closed the week at $31.97 after a 3% uptick in today’s trading.

Since 2019 the Murdochs have led a slimmed-down Fox Corp. as a stand-alone entity after the family agreed to sell most of 21st Century Fox to Disney.

Rupert Murdoch Fox’s chairman received a pay package totaling $18.4 million last year. That was down from $31.1 million a year earlier. Similarly Lachlan Murdoch Fox’s executive chairman and CEO received a $21.7 million pay package down from $27.7 million a year earlier.

The declines were due in part to a reduction in non-equity incentive plan compensation for both Murdochs which went to $6.3 million down from $10.5 million in the prior year. It also reflected a change in value to pension and deferred compensation plans.

The pay packages were disclosed in a securities filing Friday. The filing also revealed that Lachlan Murdoch signed a contract extension in 2021 keeping him at the helm of the company through June 2026.

Other top Fox executives including CFO Steve Tomsic chief legal and policy officer Viet Dinh and COO John Nallen saw their compensation decline year over year.

Fox Corp. includes Fox News Media Fox Sports as well as the Fox broadcast network. Rupert Murdoch also serves as chairman of News Corp. which owns The Wall Street Journal. The company will hold its annual shareholder meeting on the Fox Lot in Los Angeles Nov. 3.

In addition to a shareholder vote on political lobbying disclosures and votes for board members Fox is also proposing to amend its certificate of incorporation to take advantage of a recent Delaware law that limits the personal liability of certain officers of the company.

Here at Independent Australia we are no fans of the Murdoch media’s near monopoly of the Australian political landscape as can be seen by our fearless coverage for well over a decade.

In fact we published an entire series of articles from Rupert Murdoch's News Ltd lieutenant Rodney E Lever blowing apart the mythology that has grown up around the ageing tycoon. It’s fair to say we were speaking truth to Murdoch’s power well before it became cool as you can see HERE.

Long before Crikey decided to stick its head above the parapet and issue this challenge to Lachlan Murdoch Independent Australia was being mauled by Murdoch's minions. We were being attacked scorned and subjected to almost innumerable legal letters from News Corp practically all of which threatened our very continuation as a publication. That's because we were actually broke — not pretend poor like Crikey.

So while we support attempts to loosen the chokehold the Murdochs have over Australia’s media and political landscape we have some serious problems with Crikey’s recent well-publicised crowdfunding campaign some of which we discussed in an article last week.

That article raised several important questions and suggested many more. Such as why did Crikey represent itself as a ""small"" poorly funded ""minnow"" when it is in fact owned by millionaires and billionaires? Why did Crikey imply it is not mainstream when one of Crikey’s senior shareholders is a scion of arguably Australia's oldest media dynasty Fairfax Media and another an offshoot of a prominent Irish media conglomerate?

Why did those behind Crikey not disclose this information in their vast crowdfunding campaign which included a full-page advertisement in the New York Times? What sort of “minnow” can even afford such an advertisement? What has changed for Crikey which has previously excoriated other truly independent media outlets for crowdfunding defamation defences? And why does Crikey now contend that crowdfunding a defamation defence – for a lawsuit it openly provoked and is more than capable of self-funding – is acceptable?

This article will discuss those matters as well as the cold calculation which led to Crikey rekindling a case that had already been effectively resolved. Done it seems in order to lure the Murdochs into an expensive dispute that Crikey' could then use as a very profitable publicity stunt.

BEHIND CRIKEY’S CROWDFUNDING

In last week’s article we discussed Crikey’s humble origins as a small gossip newsletter before being purchased by multimillionaire Eric Beecher in 2005.

We then explained that since the buyout Crikey has amassed several wealthy investors — the most noteworthy being billionaire media mogul John B Fairfax who owns approximately 30 per cent of the company. Yet despite this Crikey has launched a crowdfunding campaign to support its defence against News Corp co-chairman Lachlan Murdoch's defamation lawsuit.

This lawsuit was filed after Crikey published an article suggesting the Murdochs conspired with Donald Trump to incite the 6 January 2021 United States Capitol attack. We noted that originally the offending article was removed 20 minutes after receiving the first concerns notice only to be republished a month later thus rekindling the matter. Crikey paid for a series of ads in the New York Times portraying themselves as the ""small independent"" poorly funded down-at-heel ""minnow"" standing up against the vast rich bullying behemoth. The only thing clearly true about all that rhetoric is that Crikey is small — as in not widely read.

The last article blew apart the myth of Crikey'slack of resources now let's focus on their claim of being “independent”.

CRIKEY ... “INDEPENDENT”?

Crikey's GoFundMe blurb mentions its battle against “billionaire” Lachlan Murdoch. But as we have seen Crikey is itself backed by a billionaire media tycoon John B Fairfax along with other multimillionaire media tycoons including chief executive Eric Beecher himself.

Fairfax Media figures prominently in the Crikey story. Fairfax had a significant stake in Beecher’s cash cow Text for several years before it acquired the rest in 2003.

Beecher is obviously a canny businessman because besides being chair of Crikey's parent company Private Media he is also the chair of Solstice Media the parent company of The New Daily. The New Daily which unlike Crikey has no paywall is funded by industry super funds. It was Beecher’s brainchild and is now vastly more popular and influential than Crikey. And it is run by his former colleague close friend and fellow Murdoch enemy Bruce Guthrie.

So Beecher seems highly proficient at attracting blue-chip media investment and placing his allies in positions of power. He has a knack for business — and there's nothing wrong with that. But he is also an insider – about as mainstream as you could possibly be – and so to call Crikey ""independent"" is laughable. Beecher flies mostly under the radar but he has an obviously close association with the big end of town. With a number of large institutional investors major financial interests high-profile identities – both inside and outside the media industry — along with outright media tycoons and dynasties.

That includes the Fairfax family for whom Beecher has worked in one way or another throughout his career. The Fairfax's have had their hooks into Australian news publishing since the 1840s and probably regard the Murdochs as vulgar upstart new money parvenus.

In 2017 Private Media sold a large stake in its business to billionaire JB Fairfax as well as Irish media tycoon Cameron O’Reilly. Fairfax currently owns about 30 per cent of Private Media and O'Reilly a lesser stake.

In 2019 the pair pumped additional millions into Crikey which allowed the publication to hire an additional dozen staff members.

Reflecting on this latest cash injection into Crikey JB Fairfax made some rather revealing remarks last year.

JB said a lot of his friends think Crikey is“far too left”:

We went to invest in Crikey and we were concerned about that because at the time Crikey – I don’t want to put [founder] Stephen Mayne down – but it didn’t have a great reputation. It’s changed altogether now under Eric Beecher and [editor-in-chief] Peter Fray. They’re doing a very good job there although a lot of my friends come up and say “it’s far too left”.

Crikey might become 'trustworthy and worthwhile' said JB generously but wasn't there yet:

“It’s on the road to doing a good job. It’s not there yet. But I think [it’s] an organ that might develop into a very trustworthy and worthwhile news operation.”

And what an organ it is! Maybe under the fatherly guiding hands of this billionaire member of the Bunyip aristocracy Crikey can become more worthwhile trustworthy and especially rightwing.

Send your meagre savings to small independent minnow Crikey fellow progressives. You know it makes sense.

Acres of corn stand tall on both sides of a narrow country road in northwest Indiana. It’s late August and the corn is tasseling its golden crown coated in dew droplets that are glinting off the morning summer sun. Then there is a different gleam on the horizon one that’s brighter.

Sprouting out of the corn like a super crop are four arrays of solar panels standing 20 feet high and towering above the stalks growing below. Both corn and panels are harvesting the sun.

“Either way they are storing solar energy” said Mitch Tuinstra a professor of plant breeding and genetics at Purdue University. “One is storing them as electrons and the other in the plants.”

Tuinstra is one of several Purdue faculty and graduate students studying these solar arrays on the university’s research field just a few miles off campus in West Lafayette Ind.

Farmland is well suited for solar development of all kinds for the same reasons it’s good for growing crops — it’s largely flat drains well and gets lots of sun. What makes these Purdue research panels different is that they haven’t taken farmland out of production — they’re built overtop of the corn itself.

It’s a practice known as “agrivoltaics” or “agrisolar” where active farming and solar happen in the same place instead of separately. The approach brings many complications that researchers are still trying to address — but they see big benefits in trying to hone in on best practices.

Farmers who want to lease their land for solar as an extra income source will reap even more economic benefits if that land stays in production — and some approaches to agrivoltaics may even help the crops themselves researchers say.

“We want to see if we can devise systems that have minimal losses in terms of crop productivity while maximizing their electricity output” Tuinstra said.

Moreover he said researchers want to see how the co-location strategy could be a salve to a growing strain between solar and farming in the Corn Belt — where residents and towns are pushing back on what they see as industrialization in rural communities.

Solar potential in farm country

The stakes behind this effort are high: Solar power has a key role to play in reducing the greenhouse gas emissions chiefly from fossil fuel-fired power plants that are driving the increasingly deadly effects of climate change.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that by the year 2050 — when the Paris Climate Accords say the world must reach net-zero carbon emissions to avert further climate catastrophe — solar generation will account for 20 percent of net electricity generation in the U.S. up from a mere 3 percent in 2020. The Biden administration is investing to get to that point including billions under the Inflation Reduction Act for solar production and investment tax credits.

But panels can’t be concentrated in one region — such as the deserts of the Southwest — because of the high cost of transmitting the energy to other locales. Instead Tuinstra said localized renewables buildout will help utilities and consumers reap the benefits close to home.

A 2021 Department of Energy report concluded that by 2050 land equal to a maximum of 0.5 percent of the contiguous United States’ surface area would be required for solar projects to help meet climate change goals. By comparison farms account for approximately 40 percent of all land in the United States. Still that 0.5 percent of U.S. land would represent nearly 9.5 million actual acres close to that of all the corn and soybeans planted in Indiana alone.

In the Corn Belt the majority of land that could be used for solar is tied up in row crops. For some residents in these areas solar represents an eyesore and a threat to crops and culture.

Concern for tradition

In late August the corn surrounding the Palo Community Center in Palo Iowa was more than six feet tall on its way toward harvest season. But this year something else was sprouting up nearby: signs with the symbol for “no” through the words “industrial solar.”

In the community center residents waited to hear the fate of a proposed 200-megawatt solar installation — a traditional design not agrivoltaics — that would be sited on farmland near town. Some attendees supported the project; many condemned it most citing objections to taking cropland out of production. The projects were approved the following week.

When several meeting attendees were asked if layering solar arrays over active farmland could be a viable compromise many were skeptical.

Robert Little a 74-year-old electrician who said he has worked on farms throughout his life said agrivoltaics could put generational practices in jeopardy.

“The biggest concern would be old family traditions” Little said. “And the other conflict is that I don't think it could ever work.”

Communities and counties across the Midwest are saying no to solar — like in Indiana where nearly a third of counties have ordinances restricting if not prohibiting renewable projects. This skepticism is a big motivator for researchers who see agrivoltaics as a win-win approach.

‘It’s a Catch-22’

But there are unresolved challenges — like the shadows produced by solar panels. Tuinstra at his team at Purdue are studying this hoping to model the optimal spacing between arrays and develop technology to keep excessive shadows from interfering with crop production.

Building agrivoltaic in cooler environments could even be good for both the panels and the plants below according to Bowman.

In the Southwest and Northeast one federal program is looking at co-locating solar with specialty crops such as lettuces tomatoes and berries. These smaller plants are better suited for an agrivoltaic environment because they benefit from shade and require smaller equipment.

But in the Midwest corn and soy acreage far exceeds that of specialty crops — and it requires more sun and bigger equipment for planting and harvest. So some studies are also looking at how to engineer different types of seeds and crops that are better suited for growing under solar.

Social scientists on the Purdue team are also researching public concerns surrounding agrivoltaics and how to communicate about them with farmers using facts Tuinstra said. And solar companies are getting involved reaching out for advice on designing a system that can fit around planting and harvesting.

But trying to optimize both crops and technology is putting researchers and developers in a chicken-and-egg loop: To get funding for projects and lower development costs you need years of proof that they work. But to build those proofs of concept you need money and affordability.

“It’s the Catch-22” said Andrew Poor the CEO of Midwest Agrivoltaic Systems. “I’m always looking for funding.”

Poor’s company is doing its own research on cost-effective ways to build taller wider-spaced solar panel racks that can accommodate taller crops and bigger equipment. He’s pursuing smaller agrivoltaics projects with partners willing to pay for the cost of materials hoping to eventually ramp up to more expansive production as data rolls in.

But it’s tough to attract development partners in a field that remains relatively unproven.

“They seem just as leery as the farmers are when it comes to signing up for a project” said Tyler Lloyd the solar operations director of Midwest Agrivoltaic Systems.

Still not every farmer is opposed. Those with combinations of row crops and livestock have proved more receptive to the idea of agrivoltaics Bowman said. Newer farmers less tied to traditional growing and harvesting tactics may also be interested in the tech.

“The trend has been to get this big equipment to farm a lot of acres and to farm it fast in a timely fashion to get the maximum yields” he said — so to see solar proliferate on conventional farmland “it may take a different mindset.”

Per a report from Fox 13 Memphis the theft occurred just after midnight on September 6 in an industrial area that borders Nike’s Memphis distribution center — one of the brand’s biggest shipping hubs in the USA alongside a similar facility in Foothills Ranch CA.

A group of thieves gained access to the trailers after breaking through the perimeter fences surrounding them and per a low-res photo captured at the scene of the crime ransacked the trucks leaving a cardboard soup of shipping and shoe boxes strewn around the crime scene. The Memphis Police Department informed Fox 13 Memphis that Nike does have security cameras at their shipping facility however they’re only placed in the front so they were not able to capture images of the crime in progress. At the time of writing the Memphis Police Department is still searching for the perpetrators.

This isn’t the first time Nike’s warehouse in Memphis has been targeted by thieves: its high visibility and stock of valuable products have long made it an attractive target for criminals. Past examples include a man named Charles Jennings who in 2014 gained entry to a company lot and drove off with a shipment of 7500 LeBron 12s (estimated retail value: $1.5 million). In 2021 a DHL worker in Memphis was caught printing duplicate tracking numbers to send Nike products to other addresses and this June a group of men were arrested for breaking into a Memphis rail yard’s train cars and stealing $150000 USD worth of Air Max sneakers.

And they have indicated that other customers could begin to see service disruptions as early as this Tuesday Sept. 13 as railroads prepare for a possible shutdown.

Ed Elkins executive vice president and chief marketing officer at Norfolk Southern wrote in a Friday message to intermodal customers that railroads “have reached or are finalizing tentative agreements with 10 of the 12 unions involved in negotiations.” To date five unions have announced tentative agreements [see “Two more unions reach tentative agreements …” Trains News Wire Sept. 3 2022].

“We asked the two holdout unions for a commitment not to strike so we could continue normal operations” Elkins wrote “but they have declined.”

That being the case Elkins said NS will begin embargoing certain types of shipments as of today “which includes rail security-sensitive material and certain time-sensitive shipments outlined in the embargo.” Other customers including bulk unit trains intermodal and automotive will see a curtailment of service up to 72 hours before the end of the cooling-off period “to prepare for a safe and orderly stoppage should there be a strike.”

The National Carriers’ Conference Committee which represents all U.S. Class I railroads except Canadian Pacific is continuing to negotiation with unions over a new national contract following the release of recommendations from a Presidential Emergency Board to address the ongoing labor dispute [see “Presidential Emergency Board issues rail contract recommendations …” News Wire Aug. 16 2022]. The 30-day cooling-off period triggered by the release of the board’s recommendations ends at 12:01 a.m. on Friday Sept. 16 at which time unions can strike or can be locked out by the railroads.

“If the position of the unions changes and the threat of a strike is retracted we will seek to resume normal operations as quickly as possible” Elkins wrote. NS has also posted an update with some of the same information on its web site.

Union Pacific in its announcement to customers provided a link to the Association of American Railroads statement which says in part that railroads “are taking all measures necessary to handle sensitive cargo in accordance with federal regulations to ensure that no such cargo is left on an unattended or unsecured train in the event of a work stoppage.” It also warns that other customers “may also start to experience delayed or suspended service over the course of next week” as railroads prepare for a possible shutdown.

UP said it will begin to secure hazardous and other security-sensitive materials on its property as of Monday Sept. 12 and will embargo new shipments of hazardous commodities included in a 15-page list. “This is a proactive measure we are taking ahead of any potential work stoppages due to an impasse in labor negotiations” UP said in its statement.

BNSF posted its own letter to customers later on Friday from Steve Bobb executive vice president and chief marketing officer saying it would begin to take action to address hazardous and security-sensitive materials as early as Monday Sept. 12. Like the NS post it urged shippers to contact members of Congress to “let them know the impact a rail service interruption would have on your business and your customers.”

The NS BNSF and AAR statements all say that the moves “do not mean that a work stoppage is certain.”

However with volatility ruling the roost as far as the U.S economy is concerned freight revenues have been moving south of late.

The Cass Freight Shipments Index declined 1.7% month over month in July. What is more concerning is that the measure has decreased in four (January April June and July) of the seven months reported so far this year. High inflation apart supply-chain woes inducing labor and equipment shortages are hurting railroad volumes.

Due to the above-mentioned headwinds the railroad industry has underperformed the S&P 500 Index over the past six months. The stocks in this industry have collectively lost 9.3% while the Zacks S&P 500 composite has declined 7.5%.

Now the question is does the presence of these headwinds imply that stocks from this industry should be ignored by investors? The answer is a categorical no. We believe that dividend-paying railroad stocks like Union Pacific Corporation UNP and Norfolk Southern Corporation NSC should be on investors’ watch list despite the downtrends.

Investors are always on the lookout for dividend stocks as these provide a steady source of income and a cushion against market uncertainty as is the current scenario. Dividend stocks not only provide a solid income stream but also have fewer chances of experiencing wild price swings.

Dividend stocks are safe bets for creating wealth as the payouts generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty. In view of the tailwinds mentioned it can be safely said that dividend-paying stocks appear as a preferred option compared to non-dividend-paying stocks in periods of high degree of market volatility as the present situation.

We zeroed in on the above-mentioned railroad dividend-paying stocks by running the Zacks Stocks Screener. Our choices have a dividend yield in excess of 2% and a dividend payout ratio of less than 50%. Also both stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Despite the inclusion of access to potable water on Sustainable Development Goals and efforts of the Nigerian government several Nigerian communities still rely on unsafe sources of water. But a non-governmental organisation is working on changing the narratives as it moves to provide potable water to communities in northern Nigeria that are adversely affected by lack of potable water Daily Trust Saturday reports.

Misbahu el-Hamza

On March 21 2022 the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) released a report commemorating World Water Day which is observed on March 22 every year. Over 86 per cent of Nigerians or 176 million people lack access to a supply of securely managed drinking water. The report has painted a grim picture of Nigeria’s catastrophic clean drinkable water shortage and its immediate impacts. This problem is particularly critical in northern Nigeria where just 30 per cent of the population has access to potable water.

Providing access to a good drinking water source

Water The Needy Foundation (WTNF) a non-governmental organization is devoted to putting a smile on the faces of Nigerians by providing access to potable inexpensive drinking water in rural and remote communities around the country. The effort to help communities access at least a traditional well so that women and girls do not have to trek a long distance to collect water began in 2017. WTNF founder Muhammad Mustapha a 35-year-old businessman started crowdfunding using his Twitter account.

In the initial stage Muhammad recalled there was no intention of forming a foundation. But the need arose when he noticed how committed donors were to funding each project he tweeted. “We started with a personal bank account to collect donations but eventually we had to register the foundation because many donations were coming in and we wanted to ensure transparency and accountability.”

He formed a team of four people and officially registered the foundation in September 2019. From 2017 to date WTNF has completed over 600 projects across 19 northern states including the Federal Capital Territory and Osun and Ogun States in the southwest.

Each project is carried out based on requests from community members through the foundation’s social media accounts or by recommendations. The foundation offers three types of interventions: traditional wells manually operated and solar-powered boreholes. There’s no preference for what to construct in a community. However the foundation is not employing a one-size-fits-all approach to beneficiary communities. Instead it uses a multi-dimensional analysis approach to factor in local situations and direct efforts to the community’s needs.

“The type of project we carry out in a community depends on the nature of the community” Muhammad explained. “For villages we prefer to construct a traditional well mainly because of maintenance.”

On average a traditional well costs them N110000 N600000-N950000 for manual pump boreholes and N2.5 million for solar boreholes as they frequently tell sponsors before the recent hike in naira-dollar exchange. The road access and groundwater level also affect project costs. WTNF has completed 16 electric/solar boreholes across five states—FCT Kano Katsina Sokoto and Zamfara.

Communities taking ownership

After completing a project WTNF hands it over to the locals while leaving their contact information and painting the names of the sponsors who requested it.

Lawan Musa 53 is the chairman of the Tafasa Community Forum Kura Local Government Area of Kano State. He said a team from the WTNF came in February 2020 to inform them of their intent and scout for a suitable location to build a solar borehole. Tafasa was recommended for the borehole by WTNF’s national project supervisor Engr. Abubakar Mahmud who also doubled as local supervisor in Kano State. He said it took them less than a week to complete the construction.

“When I saw the water pumped out my happiness was unquantifiable. I felt like someone had paid for my pilgrimage to Mecca. It’s the peak of happiness one can have in this world.”

After commissioning the project the community members set up a 5-man committee to manage it. But then there was a problem. Residents must wait for the sun to rise for the solar to be powered and pump water. If people finish the 1500-litre tank they must wait an hour or two to pump it again.

A few months later Lawan phoned to ask Engr. Abubakar if they could be allowed to convert the solar into an electric borehole. The supervisor said “It is no longer WTNF’s property; it’s your own. You can do as you please if you wouldn’t damage it or refuse the general public the opportunity to collect water free of charge.”

The committee planned and tasked eight houses interested in channeling water into their homes with N10000 each to fund the conversion. Within 2 weeks they were able to buy a second-hand 4.5K volt amp generator to pump the water. They also replaced the donated 1.5 HP submersible water pump with a 3.5 HP. They built a 9-square-meter generator house which also served as a control station for the borehole. The borehole now pumps more water within a short time and serves over 500 homes and neighbouring communities in Tafasa at no cost.

Halima Ahmad a mother of three young girls in Tafasa said she spent about N4000 a month buying water before the borehole. And if she did not have money two of her daughters had to trek two kilometers to fetch water. “Our kids hated being told to go and fetch water because of the distance” she said. “This made them miss school.” But now children even crave being asked to fetch water from the new borehole. The conversion of the solar into an electric borehole by the Tafasa community was a well-thought-out plan. It improved the capacity of the borehole and reduced waiting time. Nonetheless Lawan stated that they intend to replace the donated 1500-litre tank with a larger one.

The activities of WTNF aren’t going unnoticed. Many foundations reached out to members of the foundation seeking advice on how they could replicate the intervention in their respective states. “First it’s all about transparency and accountability” noted Amina Sha’aban the foundation’s secretary. “Once people send you money and you can’t account for it there’s a problem.”

“When we identify a community in need we post it online to seek donations. Upon securing a sponsor we then go to the community and introduce the project to the head of the community from whom we’ll get a location and have our experts determine the presence of water. We then assign a local supervisor who’ll report to us so we can send updates to all donors.”

According to Amina being sincere and accountable is the only way to do away with any mistrust from sponsors.

And the strategy appears to be working. They no longer have to post on social media asking for donations to complete a project. They have surplus donations and standby sponsors waiting to pay for the next project “especially the traditional well” according to Muhammad.

Maintenance is a significant issue for most NGOs in Nigeria. “You build a borehole and you’ll see that within six months it stops working because the people aren’t taking care of it” laments Abubakar. “We leave behind our phone numbers in every community but still some will fail to reach out.”

Therefore to ensure the long-term viability of its projects WTNF established a functional system for returning to beneficiary communities for stakeholder management and engagement to ensure that all projects are operational. They carry out monitoring and evaluation supervision during the rainy season. “The rainy season is when we stop building wells and boreholes as it’s not advisable to do that because you wouldn’t have the real water level” Muhammad explained.

WTNF needs to expand its reach because they still get many requests from other communities almost daily. And there’s obviously a need for others to champion similar interventions so that 26.5 million Nigerian children don’t have to experience high or extreme water vulnerability.

Insecurity in some parts of the country is a significant hurdle for the WTNF. Muhammad said that recently they’ve been unable to reach out to Zamfara despite huge demand from various communities in the state. “We’re all afraid. I wouldn’t want to risk the security of my workers because these bandits wouldn’t care whether they’re workers or not.”

(NYSE: WOLF) the global leader in Silicon Carbide technology today announced it will build a new state-of-the-art multi-billion-dollar Materials manufacturing facility in Chatham County North Carolina. The investment is targeted to generate a more than 10 fold increase from Wolfspeed’s current Silicon Carbide production capacity on its Durham campus supporting the company’s long-term growth strategy accelerating the adoption of Silicon Carbide semiconductors across a wide array of end-markets and unlocking a new era of energy efficiency.

“Wolfspeed is the industry leader in supplying the materials required to meet the accelerating demand for next generation semiconductors and creating a more sustainable future for all. Demand for our products continues to grow at a rapid pace and the industry continues to be supply constrained. Expanding our Materials production will further our market leadership and allow us to better serve the growing needs of our customers” said Gregg Lowe President and CEO of Wolfspeed. “We are particularly excited and proud to not only expand Wolfspeed’s footprint in our home state of North Carolina but also further our relationship with North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University to nurture our best-in-class talent pool.”

The facility will primarily produce 200mm Silicon Carbide wafers which are 1.7x larger than 150mm wafers translating into more chips per wafer and ultimately lower device costs. These wafers will be used to supply Wolfspeed’s Mohawk Valley Fab which opened earlier this year as the world’s first largest and only fully automated 200mm Silicon Carbide fabrication facility.

Phase one construction is anticipated to be completed in 2024 and cost approximately $1.3 billion. Between 2024 and the end of the decade the company will add additional capacity as needed eventually occupying more than one million square feet on the 445-acre site.

State and local funding including a Job Development Investment Grant from the North Carolina Department of Commerce will support the development of the facility’s first phase and represents an approximately $1.0 billion incentive package from the State County and local governments. In addition the company hopes to apply for and obtain federal funding from the CHIPS and Science Act to accelerate the construction and build-out of the facility. Over the next eight years the company intends to continue to invest looking to create roughly 1800 jobs.

“Wolfspeed’s decision further validates North Carolina as the epicenter of clean energy” said North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper. “This is another milestone in our drive toward a clean energy economy as it will boost electric vehicle manufacturing and offshore wind while fighting climate change and putting money in the pockets of every day North Carolinians with great paying jobs.”

The company’s talent development strategy is complemented by its continued partnership with North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (N.C. A&T). In 2020 Wolfspeed committed $4 million over five years to the HBCU – at the time the single largest donation in the university’s history to create the Wolfspeed Endowed Scholars Program. The two entities aim to establish comprehensive education and training curricula and cutting-edge research and innovation programs. This partnership will open opportunities for undergraduate and graduate credentials in Silicon Carbide semiconductor manufacturing as well as training and career advancement programs for existing semiconductor manufacturing workers.

“North Carolina A&T is proud to partner with Wolfspeed to provide new opportunities to pursue the next generation of careers in the green economy drive innovation and explore new possibilities” said N.C. A&T Chancellor Harold L. Martin Sr. “Throughout our rich history as a doctoral land-grant university and the largest historically Black university in the country we have believed in the power of our students to change the world. Our expanded partnership with Wolfspeed will allow us to change the world together and I am incredibly excited for what is to come.”

NOC,Northrop Grumman,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9ub3J0aHJvcC1ncnVtbWFuLWNlby1vbi13YXItd2VhcG9ucy0xNjQyMTc1NTMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Northrop Grumman CEO: 'We don't build weapons with an intent to go to war',"Some countries go to war solely in pursuit of their own interests.

But not the United States says one defense industry CEO. On a recent episode of ""Influencers with Andy Serwer"" Northrop Grumman (NOC) CEO Kathy Warden explained her view of the United States’ role in international relations.

“I would say that from an industrial-based perspective the U.S. even more so than any other part of the world feels a responsibility for global security” she told Yahoo Finance's editor-in-chief.

Presently the U.S. has one of the largest militaries in the world with over 2.1 million active personnel according to a 2022 World Population Report. That report found the U.S. spends over 3.52% of its total GDP on military expenditures. That's compared to other NATO countries such as Spain and Canada which spent just 1.02% and 1.39% respectively.

The U.S. also has 700 military bases around 80 countries and territories across the globe according to research from American University professor David Vine.

Northrop Grumman CEO Kathy J. Warden Speaks to Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer

Northrop Grumman — an aeronautics defense and cyberspace company with origins dating back to the 1930s — builds weapons including warheads and hypersonic missiles. The firm is also currently developing the Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider a strategic bomber than can deliver nuclear weapons. Still Warden asserts that Northrop intends its products to be used for good rather than for ill.

“We are very much aligned to a philosophy that we don't build weapons with an intent to go to war. We build weapons with an intent to deter conflict and achieve peaceful resolution” Warden said.

Most Americans would likely agree that the U.S. should avoid war. Around over 70% of Americans say that good diplomacy is the best way to secure peace while nearly 30% prefer military intervention according to Pew Research Data from 2019. Attitudes on war may also depend on one's political party. Over half of conservative Republicans say military strength is the best way to ensure peace the Pew Data found.

“I feel strongly that our role in national security is actually keeping the world and the people in it safer every day. Not driving us toward conflict” Warden remarked.

Warden joined Northrop Grumman in 2008 and has been CEO since 2019. Previously she worked at Veridian Corporation and General Dynamics and she spent nearly a decade with General Electric.

Northrop Grumman headquartered in Falls Church Virginia employs roughly 97000 people. The company has a market cap of $75 billion and its stock was trading at roughly $490 a share on Sept. 9.

The trials follow the US Navy’s replacement of its Hornet legacy targeting pods with the system earlier this year.

During the trials pilots conducted maneuvers and combat operations including ground-moving target tracking air-to-air tracking and target designation.

They also tested LITENING’s eye-safe training laser mode which provides realistic training with combat controllers on the ground.

The pilots had not received advanced training before the flight tests to demonstrate the LITENING pod’s ease of use according to the company.

“This first flight demonstrated LITENING’s ability to rapidly add modern upgradeable mission capabilities to the Super Hornet” Northrop Grumman Navigation Targeting and Survivability Vice President James Conroy said.

“The pod’s digital video autonomous target tracking and laser sensors will give Naval aviators an entirely new set of capabilities for operations over land and sea today and the growth capabilities built into LITENING’s modular design ensure that the pod can evolve to meet changing requirements.”

The LITENING Advanced Targeting Pod

LITENING is an electro-optical infrared sensor system that allows pilots to detect identify and track targets.

It features high-definition digital colored video 1K short and medium-wave infrared sensors advanced 2-color laser designation near-real-time viewing plug-and-play data links and multiple laser spot tracking.

Northrop Grumman has delivered over 900 LITENING pods to international customers according to the firm.

“Space is the most exciting area of our portfolio at the moment” Warden told Yahoo Finance.

The U.S. aerospace industry saw serious challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic shrinking by 87000 jobs and seeing total revenues drop 2.8% to $874 billion between 2019 and 2020 according to the most recent Aerospace Industries Association Facts and Figures Report.

Though it has yet to reach pre-pandemic levels of success the global aerospace industry has recently turned a corner. It reported $712 billion in revenue in 2021 which is up 4% over 2020. It also reported $62 billion of operating profit up 136% according to an analysis by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

Northrop Grumman — an aeronautics defense and cyberspace company headquartered in Falls Church Virginia with origins in the 1930s — builds missiles bomber aircrafts and solid rocket boosters for NASA's Space Launch program. The company has a long history of working with NASA. But since 2018 when it acquired aerospace firm Orbital ATK the company's space division has expanded. In the last quarter space-related business accounted for over 30% of the company's total sales.

“The expansion of opportunity in space has been significant and I foresee that continuing into the future” Warden remarked.

One of the company's most significant products is the James Webb Telescope. Launched into space in December 2021 the telescope takes pictures of astronomical objects using infrared radiation. NASA released its first full-color images during a televised broadcast last July. The pictures which went viral on social media depicted part of Carina a constellation of stars.

“In space exploration like the work that we recently launched the James Webb Space Telescope. And it brought back just fantastic images of the origins of our universe that will help to rewrite science textbooks” Warden said. “And help I hope a new generation of people to get really excited about what may be happening in space in generations to come.”

This week NASA released two new images taken by the James Webb Telescope. They show the Tarantula Nebula and could yield scientific discoveries about how stars form. The telescope will remain in space for another decade and continue to produce new images.

The 7-Eleven due to open by the end of the year will complete the 19-acre Cedar Village retail center on the site of the old Northrop Grumman defense technology headquarters in Hanover. A Lowe's Home Improvement center anchors the project built by developers JMF Properties and RD Management.

Across the road in Morris Township the same team expects retail tenants to soon occupy and complete work on spaces in the 140000-square-foot Morris Marketplace built in partnership with Accurate and DeVimy Equities at a former Colgate-Palmolive manufacturing plant.

""You will see a lot more tenants taking possession between now and December"" said William Lenaz of Jeffrey Realty which is leasing spaces at the marketplace.

Morris Marketplace is part of a 64-acre redevelopment straddling Morris Township and a part of Morristown that will include 143 townhomes and 60 rental units when completed. Accurate estimated costs of the Marketplace project at $50 million when it broke ground last year.

The property near the Mennan Sports Arena was sold by Colgate-Palmolive after the consumer-products maker closed its plant in 2016.

More:Judge could rule this week in Drew Forest affordable housing dispute. These are the stakes

Residents began occupying the neighboring housing development known as the Collection at Morris Township in the spring.

Leased tenants at Morris Marketplace include AT&T Optimum Jersey Mike's Wells Fargo Orangetheory Fitness Habit Burger and a Lidl Grocery. Construction continues on portions of the site.

Back in Hanover the Cedar Village site has been unoccupied since Northrop Grumman left in 1985. The 7-Eleven will include a 4000 square-foot convenience store eight pumps self-service air and a vacuum onsite. It's expected to be completed in December according to JMF founder Joe Forgione. Lowe's opened there in 2019.

'We identified 7-Eleven as a business that would thrive in this location and contribute a desired service to local residents and motorists including visitors to Mennen Arena as well as contractors and other professionals"" said Forgione a former commissioner of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority.

JMF and RD previously developed the Waterview Marketplace in Parsippany which opened in 2019 with Whole Foods as an anchor.

If you told me a few years ago that data scientists would be using Docker containers in their day to day work I wouldn’t have believed you. As a member of the broader machine learning (ML) community I always considered Docker Kubernetes Swarm (remember that?) exotic infrastructure tools for IT/Ops experts. Today it’s a different story rarely a day goes by when I don’t use a Docker container for training or hosting a model.

An attribute of machine learning development that makes it different from traditional software development is that it relies on specialized hardware such as GPUs Habana Gaudi AWS Inferentia to accelerate training and inference. This makes it challenging to have containerized deployments that are hardware-agnostic which is one of the key benefits of containers. In this blog post I’ll discuss how Docker and container technologies have evolved to address this challenge. We’ll discuss:

Why Docker has become an essential tool for machine learning today and how it addresses machine learning specific challenges

How Docker accesses specialized hardware resources on heterogeneous systems that have more than one type of processor (CPU + AI accelerators).

How different AI accelerators extend Docker for hardware access with examples of 1/ NVIDIA GPUs and NVIDIA Container Toolkit and 2/ AWS Inferentia and Neuron SDK support for containers

How to scale Docker containers on Kubernetes with hardware accelerated nodes

A large part of this blog post is motiviation and “how it works under the hood” but I also include walkthroughs links and screenshots on how you can get started with Docker containers on NVIDIA GPUs or AWS Inferentia on AWS so there is something in here for both the learner and the practitioner.

Docker and machine learning didn’t grow up together (but they’re best friends now)

Most organizations today use Docker and container technologies to simplify the development and deployment process since containerized applications are consistent portable and guarantee reproducibility. While Docker containers are supposed to be both hardware-agnostic and platform-agnostic most machine learning based software stack is hardware-specific and needs access to the hardware and hardware drivers on the host OS. To understand the issue better let’s take a closer look at the anatomy of a typical machine learning software stack.

Anatomy of a typical machine learning software stack

illustration by author

The software stack shown in the illustration above looks quite typical to start with. The top section shown with blue curly brace includes your code frameworks that you’re working with languages and other lower level libraries. This section looks similar regardless of what applications frameworks or languages you’re using. The rest of the stack is where things start to look unique for machine learning. The green boxes are hardware specific components that affects portability here’s what they do:

AI accelerator ML libraries: These are low level libraries that are used by ML frameworks to implement machine learning training or inference routines on AI accelerator hardware. They implement linear algebra and other computationally intensive routines that can be parallelized and run on AI accelerators.

These are low level libraries that are used by ML frameworks to implement machine learning training or inference routines on AI accelerator hardware. They implement linear algebra and other computationally intensive routines that can be parallelized and run on AI accelerators. AI accelerator drivers: These are drivers that the host OS uses to recognize and support the AI accelerator hardware.

These are drivers that the host OS uses to recognize and support the AI accelerator hardware. AI Accelerator: This is a dedicated processor designed to accelerate machine learning computations. Machine learning is primarily composed of matrix-matrix math operations and these specialized hardware processors are designed to accelerate these computations by exploiting parallelism. You can read more about AI accelerators in other blog posts: 1/ Guide to AI accelerators 2/ Evolution of AI accelerators

Systems that have a CPU + other types of processors are called heterogeneous systems. Heterogeneous systems improve performance and efficiency as there are dedicated processors for specific tasks but come at the cost of increased complexity. This increased complexity introduces challenges with portability of the software stack and developer user experience. This is the challenge Docker has to address and we’ll see below how it does that.

How does Docker support host devices?

By default Docker containers don’t have access to host OS resources and this is by design. Docker containers are intended to offer process isolation therefore the user has to provide explicit access to host resources such as volumes and devices. You can do that by using the —-devices argument but it comes with a few caveats.

illustration by author

Some hardware devices such as USB and serial devices have drivers that run in the kernel space and Docker must rely on the host kernel and perform system calls to interact with the device hardware. These devices are easily accessed inside the Docker container process using the --device argument and mounting the device. However other hardware devices such as some network cards and AI accelerators have drivers that have a user space component and a kernel space module. In this case you will need to duplicate the install of the driver in the host OS and the Docker container.

Let’s say you want to launch a container process and you want to expose a device called device_name0 then you’d run the following command:

docker run --device /dev/device_name0:/dev/device_name0 …

If device_name0 has both a user space and kernel space driver components then you must also install the device driver inside the Docker container which duplicates the driver on the host and container environment as shown in the illustration at the top of this section.

This setup comes with a few disadvantages:

Increased container size: Containers are supposed to be lightweight and portable and drivers are often large and take up a lot of space. For example the latest NVIDIA GPU drivers can take between 350 to 500 MB of additional space in your container. This adds to container image download and instantiation time and which can affect latency sensitivity applications and user experience

Containers are supposed to be lightweight and portable and drivers are often large and take up a lot of space. For example the latest NVIDIA GPU drivers can take between 350 to 500 MB of additional space in your container. This adds to container image download and instantiation time and which can affect latency sensitivity applications and user experience Driver version mis-match: For this solution to work the driver versions in the container environment and host OS must match. If they are different the container process may not be able to talk to the hardware.

For this solution to work the driver versions in the container environment and host OS must match. If they are different the container process may not be able to talk to the hardware. Setup complexity : Installing Drivers in containers are extra steps and every extra library or software you put in a container adds additional complexity and needs to be tested.

Installing Drivers in containers are extra steps and every extra library or software you put in a container adds additional complexity and needs to be tested. Decreased portability: Docker containers were designed to be light-weight portable and hardware-agnostic. Drivers in the containers make it heavy hardware-specific platform-specific and basically un-does all the benefits of Docker containers.

At the minimum the goal should be to address these challenges with a solution that doesn’t require device drivers to be duplicated inside the container and allow Docker to pin access to some or all the AI accelerators on the system with multiple accelerators. Let’s now take a look at how Docker address this challenge.

How do we make Docker work with specialized machine learning hardware?

illustration by author

We’ll start with a quick high-level recap on how Docker runs containers. When you use the Docker CLI to start a container process using docker run … a sequence of steps take place before it eventually calls a very important library called runC .

runC is an Open Container Initiative (OCI) compliant tool for spawning and running container processes that is used by Docker Podman CRI-O and other popular container runtimes. When you use the Docker CLI to run a container Docker provides runC with an OCI compliant runtime specification file (shown in the image as “OCI spec”) and container’s root filesystem together called a OCI compliant Bundle  which runC takes as inputs to create and run the container process. The OCI spec file has provisions for including additional options such as pre-start and post-start hooks to launch other processes before and after container processing creation. Hardware providers can take advantage of these hook to inject hardware access to the container process. Let’s see how.

Generic template for introducing AI accelerator support to Docker. illustration by author

AI accelerator providers can extend the functionality of runC using the pre-start hooks to hook into a container’s lifecycle with an external application. This external application is typically a library that talks to the hardware driver and exposes the hardware inside the container process. The blue boxes in the illustration above show how you can use Docker and runC features to advertise specialized hardware to a container process. Let’s take a looks the components in this this generic template for implementing specialized hardware support in Docker containers:

custom-runtime: Docker allows you to define a custom runtime using /etc/docker/daemon.json . Using the custom runtime you can intercept the OCI specification you receive from Docker add a pre-start hook and forward the updated specification to runC .

Docker allows you to define a custom runtime using . Using the custom runtime you can intercept the OCI specification you receive from Docker add a pre-start hook and forward the updated specification to . custom-hook: runC reads the pre-start hook from the specification it received from the custom runtime and executes the custom-hook.

reads the pre-start hook from the specification it received from the custom runtime and executes the custom-hook. This custom-hook calls a hardware-specific library or libraries that can talk to the hardware driver and expose it in the container process custom-inject-hardware-library: This library is responsible for communicating with the hardware driver to gather information about the hardware and number of processors in the system. It’s also responsible for mounting the hardware device into the container environment and making it available for applications in the container process.

Below we’ll take a look at how Docker can access NVIDIA GPUs and AWS Inferentia.

Launching NVIDIA GPU and AWS Inferentia Amazon EC2 instances

First we’ll launch Amazon EC2 instances to demonstrate how Docker works with specialized hardware. Follow this guide to launch an EC2 instance for machine learning. For NVIDIA GPUs choose any size of P or G family of instance types. If you need help choosing the right GPU for deep learning on AWS read my blog post:

For AWS Inferentia instances choose an Inf1 instance type. In this example I launch inf1.2xlarge (AWS Inferentia) and p3.8xlarge (4 x NVIDIA V100 GPUs).

Once you’ve chosen your instance type you have to choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and we’ll use the AWS Deep Learning AMI which comes with GPU drivers AWS Inferentia drivers deep learning frameworks conda and other tools pre-installed. Choose an AMI with the right type and version of the deep learning framework you need for your work for this example I’ll be choosing the ​​Multi-framework DLAMI for Ubuntu 18.04.

After you’ve launched your Amazon EC2 instances you can see them on your EC2 console and you can ssh into them to run your applications. You can also read my blog post on Why use Docker containers for machine learning development? for a walkthrough of how to ssh and set up a jupyter server in a Docker container running on EC2.

Accessing NVIDIA GPUs in Docker containers

NVIDIA offers the NVIDIA Container Toolkit a collection of tools and libraries that adds support for GPUs in Docker containers.

docker run --runtime=nvidia --gpus=all …

When you run the above command NVIDIA Container Toolkit ensures that GPUs on the system are accessible in the container process. Since we launched an Amazon EC2 instance with AWS Deep Learning AMI you won’t need to install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit as it comes pre-installed. If you’re starting with a base AMI follow the install instruction on NVIDIA Container Toolkit documentation.

How NVIDIA Container Toolkit works

NVIDIA Container Toolkit includes nvidia-container-runtime  nvidia-container-runtime-hook and libnvidia-container . Let’s take a look at how these work.

illustration by author

NVIDIA Container Toolkit registers a custom runtime by specifying it in /etc/docker/daemon.json . This custom runtime is a shim that takes the runtime specification from Docker modifies it to the pre-start hook specification and forwards the spec to runC.

NVIDIA Container Toolkit also allows you to configure the container runtime using file based config. You can edit /etc/nvidia-container-runtime/config.toml file to specify different locations for your drivers runtime change default runtime enable debugging etc. You can leave the defaults if you don’t have a custom setup.

screenshot showing config.toml

Let’s say you ran the following command

docker run --runtime=nvidia --gpus=2 …

Docker takes the command line arguments and translates it into a OCI compliant runtime spec. nvidia-container-runtime adds the pre-start to this specification and passes it on to runC . Next runC sees the pre-start hook in the modified spec and calls the nvidia-container-runtime-hook before starting the container process. The nvidia-container-runtime-hook looks at the container runtime config to determine what GPUs or how many GPUs you requested to expose in the container process. Next it calls libnvidia-container library which talks to the NVIDIA driver to determine if the requested number of GPUs (In this example we said --gpus=2 ) are available and if they are it injects those GPU devices into the container.

To test GPU access I’m going to pull down a Pytorch container from the list of deep learning containers Amazon hosts on Amazon ECR. Follow the instructions in that page to log into Amazon ECR and run docker pull <IMAGE_NAME> . Then run the following command to launch the container.

docker run -it --rm --runtime=nvidia — gpus=all <IMAGE_NAME/ID> nvidia-smi

We can see from the output that I can run nvidia-smi a tool that queries and displays all 4 GPUs available on this EC2 instance and can be accessed from within the container.

Note: --runtime=nvidia is optional if you’re using a recent versions of Docker and NVIDIA Container Toolkit

screenshot showing output of nvidia-smi running inside a Docker container showing all GPUs

If you want to expose only 2 GPUs inside the container then you can simply specify –-gpus=2 or enumerate which two you want available inside the container:

docker run -it — rm — runtime=nvidia — gpus=2 <IMAGE_NAME/ID> nvidia-smi # OR docker run -it — rm — runtime=nvidia — gpus=’”device=01""’ <IMAGE_NAME/ID> nvidia-smi

screenshot showing output of nvidia-smi running inside a Docker container showing only 2 GPUs

Accessing AWS Inferentia accelerators in Docker containers

To prepare your Inf1 Amazon EC2 instance with AWS Inferentia you can follow the steps in the AWS Neuron documentation to install the Neuron drivers Neuron runtime and a helper library called oci-add-hooks which facilitates adding OCI neuron pre-start hooks.

How Docker support AWS Inferentia works

After you’ve installed the Neuron SDK and followed the Docker environment setup steps your system should have oci-neuron-runtime oci-neuron-hook. Let’s take a look at how they work.

screenshot showing neuron runtime

Similar to NVIDIA Container Toolkit Neuron SDK registers a custom runtime by specifying it in /etc/docker/daemon.json . From the screenshot below you can see that the custom Docker runtime is just a shell script. Recall the role of the custom runtime is to simply intercept the call to runC  modify it to include a pre-start hook specification and call runC with the updated spec.

screenshot showing neuron hook shim

Let’s open open oci_neuron_hook_wrapper.sh see what it’s doing:

Specifies the path to the location of oci_neuron_hook_config.json  a JSON file that defines what library the pre-start hook should call

 a JSON file that defines what library the pre-start hook should call Gets the location of runC library

library Uses oci-add-hooks  a tool that can take a pre-start hook definition from a file called oci_neuron_hook_config.json and generate an updated runtime spec and pass it along to runC

We can open oci_neuron_hook_config.json and you can see oci_neuron_hook which is the library that’s invoked by runC prior to creating the container process.

screenshot showing hook configuration

oci_neuron_hook library talks to the AWS Inferentia driver to determine if the requested number of AWS Inferentia devices are available and if they are it injects those devices into the container. To test AWS Inferentia support in Docker download the following Docker file and run:

docker build . -f Dockerfile.app -t neuron-test docker images

And you should see a neuron-test image

screenshot showing the docker image to test neuron

Launch the container

docker run — env — runtime=oci-neuron AWS_NEURON_VISIBLE_DEVICES=”0"" neuron-test neuron-ls

screenshot showing output of neuron-ls running inside a Docker container

And you can see that Neuron Device 0 is shown by the output of neuron-ls which was executed inside the container process. Note: –-runtime=oci-neuron is optional as neuron is the default runtime as you can see below.

screenshot showing that neuron runtime as the default runtime

Kubernetes support for NVIDIA GPUs and AWS Inferentia

So far we’ve seen how Docker can provide access to specialized hardware such as NVIDIA GPUs and AWS Inferentia inside a container this allows for more portable machine learning code. The natural next step is to figure out how to run these Docker containers on an orchestration system like Kubernetes so you can run large-scale deployments. This topic deserves it own detailed blog post but I’ll aim to quickly summarize how you can access AI accelerator resources in Kubernetes for sake of completeness.

For both NVIDIA and AWS Inferentia each Kubernetes node’s host OS must include the relevant hardware drivers custom container runtimes and other libraries we discussed earlier that enable specialized hardware support within Docker containers. The easiest way to launch an Amazon EKS cluster is to use the eksctl CLI tool.

For NVIDIA GPUs nodes specify an Amazon Deep Learning AMI as the AMI for your nodes in eksctl as that it comes with NVIDIA Container Toolkit pre-installed.

as that it comes with NVIDIA Container Toolkit pre-installed. For AWS Inferentia nodes the eksctl tool will automatically detects that you have a node with AWS Inferentia and will use an Amazon Linux AMIs with Neuron SDK drivers and Docker support libraries preinstalled.

Next to make these AI accelerators available as a system resource within Kubernetes you’ll need to deploy a Kubernetes device plugin specific to the hardware. Both NVIDIA and AWS provide device plugins that you can apply as follows:

AWS Inferentia:

kubectl apply -f k8s-neuron-device-plugin.yml

This device plugin which you can download from the Neuron SDK documentation runs as a daemonset and advertises hardware to containres within pods and you can specify AWS Inferentia hardware under resources in the manifest as follows:

resources:

limits:

aws.amazon.com/neuron: 1

NVIDIA GPUs:

This NVIDIA device plugin also runs as a daemonset and advertises hardware to pods and you can specify NVIDIA GPU hardware under resources in the manifest as follows:

resources:

limits:

nvidia.com/gpu: 1

You can find more detailed instructions on how to get started for both AWS Inferentia and NVIDIA GPU on the Amazon EKS documentation pages.

Closing (and yes there is a video!)

The bad news just doesn't seem to be stopping for Nvidia (NVDA 1.19%). The graphics cards specialist received another big blow last week after the U.S. government imposed restrictions on sales of data center chips to China Hong Kong and Russia.

According to a filing with the SEC Nvidia reported that the U.S. government has ""imposed a new license requirement effective immediately for any future export to China (including Hong Kong) and Russia of the Company's A100 and forthcoming H100 integrated circuits."" The restrictions will also apply to future Nvidia products that match or exceed the performance of its A100 chips as well as systems powered by such chips.

Nvidia stock cratered on the news as China is reportedly a big market for the company. The tech giant slashed its fiscal third-quarter revenue guidance by $400 million thanks to the restrictions. The company was anticipating $5.9 billion in revenue in the current quarter pointing toward a big drop over the prior-year period thanks to the weakness in the gaming segment.

The data center business was one of the bright spots for the company with year-over-year growth of 61% to $3.8 billion. But the restrictions could knock the wind out of the data center business' growth.

In all it is a difficult time to be an Nvidia investor. The stock is down 53% in 2022 and could head lower as the company is contending with multiple headwinds. But investors shouldn't forget that Nvidia stock has appreciated 220% in the past five years despite bouts of volatility and has handsomely beaten the broader stock market.

That's why it may be a good idea for savvy investors to look into the future and see where Nvidia may be after five years as this could help them decide whether to buy this tech stock while it is beaten down.

The data center business could explode over the next five years

The gaming and the data center businesses will continue to be the pillars of Nvidia's growth over the next five years. However the company is exploring new areas within these niches that could supercharge its growth.

Nvidia is known for its data center graphics cards but is now making progress in data processing units (DPUs) and central processing units (CPUs) as well -- two areas that could unlock a massive growth opportunity for the company.

Nvidia is expected to start sampling its third generation of DPUs the BlueField-3 this year to tackle artificial intelligence and analytics workloads. These are programmable networking devices that offer a mix of general-purpose computing along with accelerators to speed up tasks. The DPUs also reduce the load of a server CPU by taking on networking and storage functions thereby improving the efficiency of server processors.

What's more Nvidia is already working on its fourth generation of data center DPUs that are expected to be released next year.

It is not surprising to see why Nvidia is looking to establish its dominance in the DPU market. CEO Jensen Huang believes that DPUs are likely to be deployed within every data center in the world by 2026 to accelerate workloads.

Meanwhile Nvidia is preparing to take a chunk out of the lucrative server processor market as well. The first servers powered by Nvidia's Grace data center CPUs are set to hit the market in the first half of 2023. Nvidia hasn't tapped the server processor market so far a space that's dominated by the likes of AMD and Intel. That's why the company's move into this market could be a big deal especially considering that the server processor market is expected to generate $42 billion in revenue in the long run.

The overall data center accelerator market is expected to clock annual growth of nearly 39% through 2027 hitting nearly $70 billion in revenue at the end of the forecast period. So Nvidia could see itself in a stronger position to tap into this huge opportunity over the next five years with a broader product portfolio.

An emerging catalyst that investors shouldn't miss

Nvidia's gaming business is in a tight spot right now thanks to an oversupply of graphics cards. However the company is taking steps to reduce its dependence on gaming-related hardware with the help of cloud gaming.

The cloud gaming business is expected to generate $22 billion in revenue by 2030 growing at an annual rate of 57% through 2030. The market's impressive growth will be driven by fast internet speeds and lower costs as compared to purchasing gaming titles and hardware as well as a growing selection of titles that gamers could stream to their devices. Nvidia is already in a terrific position to take advantage of cloud gaming as it has built a solid user base with its GeForce Now service.

The chipmaker had generated $12.5 billion in revenue from the video gaming business in fiscal 2022. This means the potential size of the cloud gaming business in the long run and Nvidia's estimated revenue share of 60% in this market suggest that this emerging segment could move the needle in a bigger way for the company in five years.

All this indicates that investors may want to keep a close eye on Nvidia and consider going long if the short-term weakness sends the stock price lower especially considering that analysts are still upbeat about its long-term prospects and expect 22% annual earnings growth for the next five years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vYXJzdGVjaG5pY2EuY29tL2luZm9ybWF0aW9uLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kvMjAyMi8wOS9udmlkaWFzLWZsYWdzaGlwLWFpLWNoaXAtcmVwb3J0ZWRseS00LTV4LWZhc3Rlci10aGFuLXRoZS1wcmV2aW91cy1jaGFtcC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia's flagship AI chip reportedly up to 4.5x faster than the previous champ,"Nvidia announced yesterday that its upcoming H100 ""Hopper"" Tensor Core GPU set new performance records during its debut in the industry-standard MLPerf benchmarks delivering results up to 4.5 times faster than the A100 which is currently Nvidia's fastest production AI chip.

The MPerf benchmarks (technically called ""MLPerfTM Inference 2.1"") measure ""inference"" workloads which demonstrate how well a chip can apply a previously trained machine learning model to new data. A group of industry firms known as the MLCommons developed the MLPerf benchmarks in 2018 to deliver a standardized metric for conveying machine learning performance to potential customers.

In particular the H100 did well in the BERT-Large benchmark which measures natural language-processing performance using the BERT model developed by Google. Nvidia credits this particular result to the Hopper architecture's Transformer Engine which specifically accelerates training transformer models. This means that the H100 could accelerate future natural language models similar to OpenAI's GPT-3 which can compose written works in many different styles and hold conversational chats.

Nvidia positions the H100 as a high-end data center GPU chip designed for AI and supercomputer applications such as image recognition large language models image synthesis and more. Analysts expect it to replace the A100 as Nvidia's flagship data center GPU but it is still in development. US government restrictions imposed last week on exports of the chips to China brought fears that Nvidia might not be able to deliver the H100 by the end of 2022 since part of its development is taking place there.

Nvidia clarified in a second Securities and Exchange Commission filing last week that the US government will allow continued development of the H100 in China so the project appears back on track for now. According to Nvidia the H100 will be available ""later this year."" If the success of the previous generation's A100 chip is any indication the H100 may power a large variety of groundbreaking AI applications in the years ahead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjZ2FtZXNuLmNvbS9tc2kvcnR4LTMwOTAtZ3B1LWRlYWwtbGVzcy10aGFuLW52aWRpYS1ydHgtMzA4MC10adIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MSI RTX 3090 GPU deal costs less than an Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti,"Nvidia RTX 3090 deals are few and far between but we’re starting to see absurd discounts pop up across the board. For whatever reason MSI’s take on the premium GPU is now available for less than an RTX 3080 Ti – a card that packs less of a punch than its souped-up sibling.

Over on Amazon the MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 3090 GPU is available for $979.99 USD thanks to a hefty 51% discount. Again the deal means you can grab the souped-up GPU for $10 less than an RTX 3080 Ti despite the fact it packs more VRAM and a higher core count.

Speaking of specs the MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 3090 boasts 24GB GDDR6X VRAM 10496 CUDA cores and a 1725MHz boost clock. Its also equipped with three display ports and an HDMI 2.1 port making it a perfect match for the best gaming monitor.

The RTX 3090 is one of Nvidia’s best graphics card options so picking one up over an RTX 3080 Ti is a no-brainer. MSI’s take on the premium GPU also pairs the green team’s high specs with a triple fan setup and efficient cooling pipes both of which help keep the pixel pusher icy cold when under load.

It’s worth noting that Nvidia is actively trying to clear out RTX 3000 supplies to make way for new RTX 4000 GPUs so the MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 3090 could sell out fast. It’s also by far the cheapest version of the SKU available at the moment as alternatives like the RTX 3090 Suprim X still cost a whopping $1690 USD.

If you sign up to Amazon Prime you’ll be able to get the RTX 3090 delivered to your door using speedy next-day delivery. New subscribers can also grab a 30-day free trial meaning you could bag the service without paying a penny. You’ll want to be quick though as this great graphics card deal likely won’t stick around for long.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2tlZWRhLmNvbS9lc3BvcnRzL2hvdy11c2UtbnZpZGlhLWZpbHRlci1nZXQtYmV0dGVyLXZpc2liaWxpdHktd2Fyem9uZS1zZWFzb24tNdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to use NVIDIA filter to get better visibility in Warzone Season 5,"Call of Duty: Warzone Season 5 arrived not long ago. With the latest update a plethora of new changes and additions were introduced to the game. Changes to Caldera were minor but they included tweaks to the lighting and weather in the map which affected the visual aspects.

The weather on the map has cleared and now the sun shines through the smoke of the volcano at the peak of Caldera. Apart from this Rebirth Island also received changes with regards to lighting.

NVIDIA filters are a part of the GeForce Experience and their proprietary software allows players to customize how the game looks. They can play around with the contrast colors and several other visual settings to tweak the game to match their desired level of fidelity.

It can be tough to spot enemies in Warzone because of how the environment is designed. On top of that some Operator skins make it hard to even spot enemies hiding in dark corners of the map. NVIDIA filters help in these situations by adjusting the colors of the game.

How to use NVIDIA filters in Warzone Season 5 for better colors and visibility

NVIDIA filters provide players with a lot of options to fine-tune the color settings of the game they are playing. It does take a hit on the frames-per-second and sometimes by upto 20%.

However tweaking the colors settings in Warzone specially can be really beneficial as they allow players to see better bringing some vividness to the gloomy and dull colors of the game.

In order to be able to use the NVIDIA filters players must have the following:

NVIDIA GPU

NVIDIA GeForce Experience

In-Game Overlay setting in GeForce Experience (Image via Sportskeeda)

If the players have the above they will have to open the NVIDIA GeForce Experience and then enable the ‘In-Game Overlay’ setting. By default this option is enabled but if for some reason it's turned off players will have to manually enable it.

The next step involves turning on the game. Once in players will have to press ‘Alt+F3’ to turn on the filter options. Upon doing that a panel would popup on the left side of the screen.

Users will now have to click on a profile which is numbered as 1 2 and 3 to enable the filter selection. Upon selecting a profile they will now have the option to use a filter from the ‘Add Filter’ drop down menu.

Best NVIDIA filter settings for visibility

NVIDIA filters can enhance the visibility and improve the game’s experience to a great extent. In order to get the most out of NVIDIA filters in Warzone players should use the following settings:

Filter 1: Brightness/Contrast

Set Exposure to -2% Contrast to 4% Highlights to 6% Shadows to -78% and Gamma to 0%.

Filter 2: Color

Under the Color filter set Tint Color to 0% Tint Intensity to 0% Temperature to 0 and Vibrance to 74.9%.

Filter 3: Details

Here set Sharpen to 50% Clarity to 56% HDR Toning to 50% and Bloom to 0%.

These settings will ensure that players have the maximum possible visibility in Warzone. They will be able to spot enemies clearly and also liven up dull maps in the game.

However it is not recommended to use NVIDIA filters if the PC configuration isn’t a bit on the higher-end of the spectrum as these filters do end up tanking the FPS."

You can even put together a portfolio of stock snippets giving you a diversified ownership stake in the best of corporate America even if you're just starting out and your budget is limited.

Say you had $1000 to invest and wanted to buy stock in NVR (NVR) a homebuilder recently rated Strong Buy by investment research firm CFRA. You'd be out of luck considering the shares recently traded for about $4200 a pop. But at Schwab for example you'd be able to buy what the company calls a Stock Slice – a single slice or up to 30 slices at a time of any S&P 500 stock for as little as $5 per slice commission-free. With Fidelity's Stocks by the Slice program you can access more than 7000 U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for as little as $1.

You can also trade fractional shares at Robinhood and InteractiveBrokers each with programs starting at $1. Eligible stocks and ETFs at Robinhood trade for more than $1 per share and have a market value of more than $25 million. InteractiveBrokers allows trading in U.S. and European stocks and ETFs. Vanguard is testing fractional trading of Vanguard ETFs for launch later this year. The rules and eligible investments for fractional share-buying differ by broker so be sure to compare options.

Investing by dollar amount rather than by number of shares makes it easy to dollar cost average – a strategy of investing a set amount at regular intervals which ensures that you buy more shares (or a bigger fraction of a share) when prices are low than when they are high. The process also helps to take the emotion out of investing.

You'll receive dividends on a pro-rated basis but as a partial shareowner you typically have no voting rights. And although you can sell anytime you want you likely won't be able to transfer fractional shares to a new brokerage.

""This is not just a supply chain issue. It's also staying at the leading edge because you know if you fall behind in the way these chips are made then the entire ecosystem suffers.""

""The semiconductor ecosystem [includes] many important parts of our economy. For example: cloud represented by companies like Microsoft and Google consumer electronics are represented by Apple and companies like that. And then even electric cars [are] represented by companies like Tesla which have a lot of compute. So a car is no longer just a vehicle it is also a computing device in many ways because it has a lot of sensors"" said Dr. SV Sreenivasan  the head of the Texas Institute of Electronics at the University of Texas at Austin.

Despite the near-constant semiconductor headlines leaders in the industry say many don't comprehend how wide-reaching and important the sector has become.

""In the '90s there was an organization called SEMATECH that operated out of Central Texas and it really was a consortium of new technologies to support the industry all over the world"" said Robb Misso  the VP of CelLink Corporation . ""It was something that we were very proud of.""

Texas has a deep history in the semiconductor industry. The creator of the modern semiconductor chip made the first integrated circuit in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. And a group of semiconductor industry leaders under the name SEMATECH called Austin home.

Cornyn's not wrong. For example the car you drive has thousands of semiconductor chips controlling pretty much every single major function from the brightness of the radio display to updating the digital odometer. They are the fourth-most traded good in the world behind crude oil processed oil and cars.

Semiconductors have dominated headlines since the pandemic started in March 2020 most commonly in reference to the global chip shortage . The microscopic computer chips control the creature comforts of modern society as well as lead national security from the touchscreens on our phones to the navigation systems on war missiles.

""The challenge when you produce [something that small] is getting everything right and eliminating any type of breakage or any type of contamination that could affect the performance of that"" Martino advised. ""To put that in perspective a skin flake is devastating at that size. So as you go into an advanced semiconductor facility it is designed so that the amount of particles in the air are so small and so few that they can't affect this. Which is why semiconductor manufacturing factory is so complex and so costly is because you're producing very small images and you need to keep the environment in the purest state in order for the end product to function.""

""We have lithography equipment developers we have furnaces or thin film capabilities actors probers"" Smith said. ""There are six distinct different pieces of equipment or business units that are part of this ecosystem that really provides technology that enables life … Our customers cannot make microchips without Tokyo Electron.""

""The lithography equipment is where we coat and develop [a wafer] with a photosensitive material and then it would move on to an etching tool or a deposition tool or a metallization tool"" said Larry Smith  the chairman of Tokyo Electron U.S. Holdings in Austin.

""Lithography is just a very expensive fancy camera to make it very simple. And let's say this camera might cost $250 million or more per camera"" Misso said. ""[Innovation] starts with the ability to print the lines of the circuit integrated circuit of a semiconductor chip smaller and smaller and smaller to add more and more devices on an a little small piece of real estate of silicon.""

Chips are typically made from silicon wafers. The wafers stretch about 12 inches across and can be cut into thousands of semiconductors. A process called lithography can cut the design into the chips using a combination of chemicals and machines.

""The best way to describe it in layman's terms it's a chip"" said Mark Pollard  COO at Astute Electronics . ""What does a chip do? You know normally it's a cellphone example. Do you have any idea what makes your cellphone work inside this really pretty glass packaging and the you know the shiny plastic? Does anyone stop and think what – how in the world it works?""

CHIPS 101: Since April I’ve been working on this project to answer all the questions I’ve heard about semiconductor chips. 16 interviews from local experts to federal lawmakers to explain all aspects of these chips. Ever seen one? It’s circled in this pic iPhone X for scale. https://t.co/QRKVCjZwY0 pic.twitter.com/4S12mRT1Km

At the company's Austin facility Samsung manufactures semiconductors as small as 14 nanometers. At the Taylor facility the South Korea-based company will be manufacturing so-called advanced semiconductors that can range anywhere from 4 to 7 nanometers. Taylor would not confirm a more specific range for proprietary reasons.

""You've got people who are building houses and building skyscrapers that you can actually see. Picture kind of doing that type of thing on a silicon substrate that you can't even actually see what you're doing without a microscope or a tunneling electron microscope or [Structured Illumination Microscopy microscope]. It's very difficult"" said Jon Taylor  the corporate vice president of fab engineering and public affairs at Samsung Austin Semiconductor .

""There's conductors like metals that are used – like wires – and there's insulators that doesn't conduct electrons"" said Steve James  VP of fab operations at Infineon 's Austin facility. ""Semiconductors we can control whether they conduct or they don't conduct. That's how we can make a computer work.""

""What you do with that size which generation after generation you make it smaller and then you pack more circuits or switches and capacitors and resistors onto this device here that then performs the function of a little computer or it's sensing biometric data and it's working together to then change your temperature actuate"" Ron Martino  the head of Global Sales at NXP Semiconductor  added.

""If you look at a state-of-the-art semiconductor device made by for example Samsung in Austin or Intel you can fit roughly 1000 of these transistors side by side across the thickness of a human hair. That's how tiny they are"" said Dr. Sanjay Banerjee  the director of the Microelectronics Research Center at the University of Texas. ""They are much smaller than for example bacteria or human blood cells.""

Experts range in complexity when defining a semiconductor chip depending on who their audience is. Semiconductors make all modern technology operate and can be as small as 4 nanometers in size. For comparison your fingernail grows about 10 nanometers in 10 seconds according to people who have been in the industry for the past few decades.

For mainstream chips Taiwan makes about 60% China makes about 25% and the U.S. makes 12% with the final 3% being spread across other countries throughout the world according to McCaul and industry leaders.

""What if tomorrow President Xi decided to invade Taiwan? It would put him in control of 90% of the global supply of these important advanced semiconductor chips"" Congressman Michael McCaul (R-Austin) said.

""That's very unique technology that really Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has virtually a monopoly on"" Pollard said. ""China is just starting to get breakthroughs with that technology. It's very expensive to get the transistors that small. China has exploited that by filling the void for the larger wafer size and they focused on that. They didn't have the expertise. So they're now filling the void of the larger wafers for the older technology which is something I believe the U.S. is going to focus on quite a bit and the innovation to get smaller and smaller and smaller.""

""You care about the chip technology because let's say you're a gamer you want a vivid graphic experience you want to be fast you want to be responsive. You're working on your PC? You want it to be able to solve those problems. You want it to be able to edit your videos and your photo collection very very efficiently. In a laptop you want a long battery life and if you're running your business you're running on the cloud or a data center you want it to efficiently run your business operations. That is chip design"" Papermaster said.

AMD is currently a ""fab-less"" semiconductor company. It designs chips used in computers laptops and gaming consoles like the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5. Chip design according to Papermaster is what helps drive innovation and combination of advanced chips and mainstream chips.

""It's essential that we have a continuous pipeline of new technologies"" Mark Papermaster  chief technology officer at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)  said. ""Why do you need new technologies? Because the demand for computing just keeps going up and up and up. So you know if we didn't get new chip technology we'd be flatline. We'd have only the kind of capabilities that we have today and we couldn't grow to meet the demand.""

""If you look at [the] year 2000 about 18% of the cost of a car was due to the semiconductors in it and now it's 40%. And that number continues to increase"" said Taylor whose facility creates the semiconductor chips for Tesla.

""You'll need a mix always"" Banerjee said. ""The reason is with these tiny devices they cannot handle very high voltages because they will break down electrically. So there are applications in automotive for example where you're not operating the devices at the voltages that you have in your computer chips which can be as low as a few volts but instead have to operate at maybe hundreds of watts. So for those devices you really need larger dimensions so that it can withstand the higher operating voltages.""

""So you need all these other chips that are built in factories as you know maybe they're not the brand-new state-of-the-art factories because you can't really shrink those chips down to the the sub-10 nanometers you know geometries like in the new factory"" James continued. ""So it doesn't make sense to build them in those factories.""

""The newest most advanced chips are usually going in the brain applications because the CPU or the microcontroller those are the ones that really benefit from smaller and smaller transistors smaller and smaller memory"" James said. ""Around those chips or in other applications you've got power semiconductors to drive those motors you've got sensors you have other types of memory that can't go with small chips. For instance there's lots of other applications that surround that chip. That chip can't talk to the outside world. It can't power itself. It can't send signals you know can't connect to the internet just by itself.

At Infineon's Fab 25 facility in Austin the company makes these types of chips for businesses all over the country and the world.

""Most of the chips that go into cars are 40 nanometer and above"" said Tyson Tuttle  the retired CEO of Silicon Labs . ""These are very old old technologies that are still very useful. And in many many cases at Silicon Labs for instance you know we wouldn't want to put in the most advanced technology because it would be more expensive and it wouldn't actually be better.""

Most technology does not change as quickly as chips do leading to a necessary supply of what leaders call ""mainstream"" semiconductors or chips that are not the smaller size of ""advanced"" chips.

""Technology companies could all move out and put China in a very bad place"" Misso added. ""So it'll be interesting to see. It's not going to be driven by nations. It's not going to be driven by politicians. It's going to be driven by companies. And it's going to be driven by the semiconductor companies I believe. So in the geopolitical realm of how things are done and the power around the world I think you're to look at the Samsungs and the Microns and the Intels and the TSMC. They're going to really have a lot of a lot of pull in what happens.""

""Most of the countries that have a big semiconductor industry in the world have their own incentives already"" James said. ""So starting with China Taiwan Korea all over Europe there are already incentives. In a way we're just trying to level the playing field with the CHIPS Act.""

Cornyn and McCaul believe the CHIPS and Science Act will bring semiconductor makers back to the U.S. further diversifying where chips are made while improving competition. However business leaders say the one-time incentive won't be enough.

""During the Cold War nuclear missiles were the mutually assured destruction. Whether we want to call you know the economic or the competition with China a 'new Cold War' – but in that competition the mutually assured destruction is a few semiconductor factories in Taiwan. And it would dramatically impact us that you know we couldn't build a lot of the products you know a lot of those end products"" Tuttle added. ""For instance iPhones are built in China. And you would think that you know hostility breaks out that's where the end products are designed. You wouldn't have access to the semiconductors. It would drive the world into a global depression if that truly came to pass.""

""Fifty percent of the global fab capacity is in Taiwan. If there was a real conflict that broke out and let's say something happened to one of those fabs or there was an embargo you couldn't make those chips"" Tuttle said. ""Inside of a mobile phone for instance you might have 20 30 different chips inside that phone. If one of them comes from a factory in Taiwan and you lose access to that you can't make that product. If you lost truly lost the capacity that's in Taiwan today you almost couldn't build anything.""

Because of the world's reliance on semiconductors in modern society Tuttle worries any monopoly within in the industry needs to be spread to other companies and countries around the world.

""If you look at globalization and how you know any one product that's designed maybe getting components or materials from all across the globe you know whether it's you know mining for lithium or neon in the case of Ukraine or titanium or gold or you know a lot of these raw materials are where the manufacturing facilities are"" Tuttle said. ""If an earthquake or tsunami or something happens certainly as a semiconductor person and then in the industry you think 'Oh gosh there's some stuff that's coming from there that's going to impact and how are we going to deal with that?'""

""The [Texas Instruments] the Intels developed a lot of this early technology and because it was more cost effective to offshore a lot of this we didn't think a whole lot about it. The companies were profitable. We still had the cachet of being the developers of this but all the while these countries took what we had innovated built on it built the infrastructure to really outpace us both from an educational research and development to really building the infrastructure to continue at scale for the pace of the semiconductor industry"" Pollard said.

""In many regions of the world the cost of building that capability can be subsidized and many people drive incentives to attract companies"" Martino added. ""By passing the CHIPS Act the U.S. is taking a step to bring that technology to the U.S. for all the reasons we've talked about because the dependency on semiconductor chips and what they do for our life and our communities is pervasive now.""

""As far as a country like China that's raced ahead of us as far as production and their ability to do it how that controls so much of what we need to do to protect our resources our people our freedoms protect our allies protect our economy"" Pollard said. ""You know we tend to swing the big stick in the world and you see that power diminished – that's a scary prospect for a country like the U.S. We've let it slip because we were the innovators of this product. I don't think anyone knew how impactful it was going to be how the technology was going to evolve to the extent that it is today.""

The legislation provides more than $52 billion in incentives: $39 billion for production $13.2 billion for research and development and $500 million for communications and supply chain improvements.

""Really the motivation for the CHIPS Act was to provide subsidies to companies to build manufacturing facilities here and also to do advanced research and development around semiconductor manufacturing and to bring that portion of that back to the U.S. And if you look globally a lot of the countries out there – whether it's China Korea Japan Taiwan – provide significant incentives to build factories in those locations"" Tuttle said. ""So it's really a bit like you're leveling the playing field in terms of making it cost-competitive to build those facilities in the U.S. whereas before we would be at maybe a 30% 40% disadvantage in terms of cost if you built the factory here which is why the factories were being built in other locations.""

""There was a growing realization that from both an economic security standpoint as well as a national security standpoint it's important to have semiconductor manufacturing done within the U.S. to a certain extent and to kind of reverse that trend"" said Tuttle who worked with other semiconductor companies to lobby the federal government to pass the funding.

""If we didn't pass the bill the CEOs of these companies told me they'd have to go elsewhere. They would go to Europe they go to Asia to those markets"" McCaul added.

""This is something we're not accustomed to doing which is making these huge federal investments and incentives to have businesses come back onshore"" Cornyn said.

To try and claw back to semiconductor independence Cornyn and McCaul led the fight to pass the CHIPS Act in 2020. After going through a few name changes  more than 18 months of sitting in Congress and some renegotiation lawmakers approved the funding portion of the bill in July 2022 under the name ""CHIPS and Science Act.""

""Over the years we had this idea that if it could be made cheaper someplace else then that was a good thing"" Cornyn said. ""It is good for consumers by and large but when it's something that's absolutely essential to our economy and the technology advances that we continue to see in our national security that's where it became a game changer.""

""If we don't ensure that we have our own independence to create these chips control the products that they go into we're really at risk"" Pollard said. ""We're at risk of falling behind as a technological leader but there's a true risk as far as the threats of our foes and what they could do and and how they could potentially cause harm.""

In the 1990s U.S. produced between 30% to 40% of the world's chips. Since then American production has fallen behind while innovation has continued to surge.

""You've seen the evidence of that already because you know when I started in the field there probably were a few dozen companies in the U.S. which worked on semiconductor devices. And over time many of them have kind of fallen by the wayside"" Banerjee said. ""Scaling of these transistors will stop long before you reach the sizes of individual atoms because other limits of quantum physics start playing a role.""

Moore's law is named after Gordon Moore one of the founders of Intel. Moore theorized semiconductors would basically shrink in half every 18 to 24 months with more transistors on each chip. In the past 40 years that's held true according to Banerjee. But as shrinking semiconductors continues to drive up costs and push up against the physical limits of chips innovators will have to find another way to advance semiconductor development.

""As time has gone on and things get smaller and smaller the costs go up"" Tuttle said. ""It actually today is more expensive to design a logic gate or a transistor on a chip. The per-transistor cost is starting to go up because of the difficulty to continue to follow Moore's Law. I like to say that the end of Moore's Law – because we are rapidly approaching the point where we will not be able to shrink further or if we shrink further it will cost so much that it won't make sense it won't make economic sense.""

Banerjee added that advanced semiconductors are coming down to the size of viruses. Chips have a physical limit to how small they can be just by the nature of the size of atoms.

""Innovation pervades all these fields whether you're doing design or whether you're doing manufacturing. And so when you say 'America leads in innovation' not in all fields not in manufacturing. So TSMC is today the leader in semiconductor manufacturing and in innovating. So they have gotten ahead"" Sreenivasan continued. ""And so you know it is somewhat naïve to think that we are No. 1 in innovation in every field. You know there are just a lot of smart people around the world. And in some fields we are lagging behind. But by and large I agree that we innovate in many many fields. But in semiconductor fabrication we are not No. 1 today.""

""You've got such a strong university system and it's University of Texas in Austin but it's also of course Texas A&M and Texas State and across the region a great feeder pool of talent"" Papermaster added. ""That's sort of the foundation. If you can't get talent you can't be a leader in an industry.""

To ensure innovation continues to happen in the industry Papermaster sees university partnerships as one possible solution to expand the research and development pipeline.

""In semiconductor manufacturing if you go into the fabs you're building equipment and developing processes and measuring things at the nanoscale. We're down to sort of a few nanometers … To give you a sense for the smallest atom hydrogen is a 10th of a nanometer. So if you lay 100 atoms of hydrogen across that's about where we are today in what we do in a fab. That's by no means you know achieved without innovation"" Sreenivasan said.

""Innovation feeds manufacturing in five 10 years down the road"" Banerjee said. ""You have to innovate and that's where the universities come in. Because unless we do the leading-edge research and produce the Ph.D.s who work at these companies you know you kill the seed corn. You kill the innovation pipeline if you will. And then manufacturing will stop – not immediately maybe but you know maybe five 10 years down the line.""

Even if the industry oversupplies in the coming months or years researchers believe production and innovation go hand-in-hand to address growing demand.

""Historically what happens in this market – and this is kind of in cycles – we overshoot the market and all of a sudden then we have a period of time where we have too much production too much equipment there's been too many people hired. And we go into a downturn or a downswing in the market"" Misso said. ""My biggest concern is that's exactly what will happen. Right now there's a lot of overreaction for us not having the capacity today to support the need from three months ago or six months ago. But I do believe it'll catch up very quickly. And when it does catch up I think we'll overshoot.""

""There's going to be ups and downs"" Pollard said. ""There's cycles [are] very much like the energy markets. I believe that we're going to see a little bit of softening in terms of the constricted supply. It's going to ebb and flow a little bit but it's largely going to continue for the next 12 to 18 months. We can really only see and predict three-quarters ahead of time roughly but it's going to continue. And then much like an energy correction it's going to correct. We're going to be oversupplied whether it's a global recession that just you know related to inflation you know the interest rates that we're reading about just to control the growth and control inflation.""

""Austin has a incredible tech legacy. Semiconductors are the foundation of that"" said Ed Latson  founder of the Austin Regional Manufacturers Association. ""You know you look back to Motorola and the work that they were doing IBM – it's really evolved and accelerated over the last 10 years especially. You know now you have world-class companies like Samsung Semiconductor you know Infineon you have this incredible commitment from Applied Materials to the region Tokyo Electron. They're all incredibly busy right now and trying to keep up with this global demand for chips.""

Kilby introduced the first integrated circuit in 1958. Since then the semiconductor industry has boomed in Texas – especially in the Austin area which is always growing and innovating.

""Texas really started the whole revolution"" Banerjee said. ""I started my life at Texas Instruments . The first integrated circuit was invented by Jack Kilby who in fact won the Nobel Prize in physics for our invention of the IC. So that happened in Dallas Texas. Texas Instruments was also the company that made the first silicon transistor.""

While the U.S. has fallen behind in the market share for global production industry leaders in the country have led innovation from the outset.

Growing pains for a strong industry :

According to the Texas Comptroller for Public Accounts the semiconductor sector of the manufacturing industry is one of the fastest-growing areas of the Texas economy. In 2020 the industry contributed $15.3 billion to the Texas GDP. Texas semiconductors made up 15% of the U.S. semiconductor GDP in that same year according to the comptroller's office.

In 2020 the semiconductor industry made up more than a quarter of all Texas exports. In terms of jobs more than 41000 Texans work in the sector. Fourteen-thousand of those jobs are in Travis and Williamson counties.

""That kind of rapid growth is really good. That does put some short-term pressure on the workforce"" said Bryan Daniel the chairman for the Texas Workforce Commission. ""There's really just this need for us to do a continued education reevaluation of our skills and just upskilling and reskilling in kind of a continuous basis in the workforce.""

As more companies in the industry move to and expand in Texas that means they all pull from the same pool of resources for the workers water energy and raw materials needed to make semiconductors and the machines that make those chips. To widen the pipeline of workers state leaders like Daniel as well as industry leaders look to job-training programs school districts and local colleges to train the next generation of semiconductor employees.

""Those jobs have now changed"" said Dr. Laura Marmolejo associate dean for manufacturing education at Austin Community College. ""Everything's robotic controlled automation. And so all the jobs now require some degree of knowledge.""

""Central Texas has brought a lot of high tech businesses into a single area like a Silicon Valley and they also are investing in different educational initiatives that helps build a strong workforce population that can work in the factories and related jobs"" Martino said. ""Also there's a university very strong university capability in Austin and Dallas and throughout Texas that helps create innovative innovative environment.""

""Even the very entry-level ones need a little bit of knowledge because these machines are much more sophisticated than they've ever been"" Marmolejo said adding ""It's not all engineers. There's so many levels that people can get into. So if you're the guy who just doesn't want to go to college no problem. We can get you in that industry in eight weeks with a short program that gives you some fundamentals.""

Workforce development will need to lead the growth in the industry experts and leaders agree. But that means supporting that workforce too.

""Some of my concerns having spent a year in Silicon Valley I know very well what it can end up being and that is the massive growth"" Taylor said. ""You know you've got to have the roads and you've got to have the housing and all those things. The technology in these great companies are going to bring people in but we also have to care for the people who are going to live here. You know when I worked in California I had technicians that would travel three hours one way to get to work in Santa Clara and then three hours home. They're on the road for six hours a day.""

Those looking at the big picture for the industry agree that there needs to be support systems in place that allow the growth to continue.

""We're going to grow into this but we've got to be deliberate in that growth"" Daniel said. ""We can't hope for the best. We've really got to do some planning and we've all got to kind of get on the same page. That ripple effect for the economy becomes part of the economy at some point.""

The ripple effect in the economy leads to job growth outside the semiconductor industry too.

""The semiconductor industry sector has a jobs multiple of seven which means we roughly have 250000 Americans working directly in the semiconductor industry but they also spin off 1.8 million more jobs"" said Tony Bennett president of the Texas Association of Manufacturers. ""So that is 250000 direct jobs times seven you get the 1.8 million that is critical to all of our sectors. But you know this is one sector that produces an exponentially large amount of indirect jobs which is important for the U.S. and the Texas economy.""

Between the direct and indirect jobs James added there are those jobs that support the semiconductor manufacturers like Samsung Infineon and NXP in Austin like Applied Materials and Tokyo Electron which make the machines to make the chips.

""There's you know four to five times ancillary jobs that are supporting us that are out there"" James said.

Even as a design company Papermaster noted the industry in Central Texas both works together and competes against each other.

""What you'll find when you look at the semiconductor industry is it's a partner-and-compete model that all of us have in the industry"" Papermaster said. ""Of course we compete. We compete on the design of our products and the markets that we go after and tailor those products to. But we partner on helping make sure that common problems can be addressed and so that is that the universities can provide us the kind of skilled pool that we need and that's to make sure that we have the right standards so that any one of our chips can work [together] with one of the other [company's] chips.""

While semiconductor facilities hire thousands of people they also use a huge amount of resources. Experts are hopeful.

""The workforce aspects you know Texas is very favorable there"" Tuttle said. ""The construction costs the land costs the availability of water and power which each of these factories requires you know reliable and substantial energy and water resources to be able to continue to grow.""

""The past couple of years certainly we had some issues with the energy you know for Winter Storm Uri. But I feel pretty confident those are resolved"" Latson said.

""We had the winter storm and now the war in Ukraine can have some effect on raw material supplies where chemicals go and what's available and that sort of thing"" Bennett said. ""There seems to always be something here of late that is challenging the industry.""

While the industry faces these challenges head-on a combination of new research and near-constant growth in demand may lead to another issue: what to do with older chips that are no longer made but are still needed in products like laundry machines or used cars.

""You think about all this demand demand demand or people keep consuming. Where does all that go? Because this is actual hardware even if it's getting smaller where does it all go at the end of the day?"" Pollard asked. ""The e-waste the e-recycling the environmental impact of all this material is a huge question. I don't have the right answer for it right now … But when your phone becomes obsolete doesn't work and it's already been changed hands three or four times and it's finally just dead how many hundreds of millions of phones and computers and devices are like that? What does the industry agree upon and what do the governments agree on as in how do we manage that? And that's something that's probably not a priority in the current situation but should come up and should be discussed. And we want to be on the forefront of that. I believe in the near future there's going to be requirements on companies that are procuring chips for their assemblies and their devices and a responsibility to what happens at that product at the end of that life. And like we do in the supply chain we will probably help facilitate that process in some way.""

With these water power and workforce challenges the cost of building new facilities continues to rise too. Samsung has already dedicated $17 billion to a single new fab in Taylor. That price tag is consistent across the industry.

""Most of the factories you know the most expensive tools in any of these factories are these photolithography tools"" Taylor said. ""We're talking over $100 million for one tool. So when you build a factory about two-thirds of the costs are actually the equipment for the process. About one-third of the cost is the building itself.""

Within the building and inside the manufacturing area itself companies have to install so-called ""clean rooms."" Even a single speck of dirt or static electricity can ruin an entire wafer of chips. When workers arrive for their shift they put a ""bunny suit"" on over their clothing walk over a rubber mat to ground their natural electric charge and enter through an air shower that sucks away any spare dust or particulate matter.

""Why is that important? That's important because if one tries to make these computer chips in a room like [my office] you know to our naked eyes it looks pretty clean right? But if you used a high-powered microscope you would see these dust particles floating around and these would be like gigantic boulders that are falling on your chips when you try to manufacture them and nothing would function properly"" Banerjee said.

The semiconductor industry won't go away for decades according to many of the people interviewed for this ""CHIPS 101"" project. For the time being almost all are optimistic about its growth and the role Central Texas will play.

""We're adding the technologies of the future"" Latson said. ""You know we have really interesting things happening around energy electric vehicles. You know communication and semiconductors are empowering that. But they're not only powering it they're being made here as well. So you know when I think about the future technology I think Central Texas is really well poised for several decades of growth and being a significant contributor to a global economy in a way that most regions can't be.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nbG9iZW5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2UvMjAyMi8wOS8wOS8yNTEzMzg4LzAvZW4vQmx1ZXRvb3RoLTUtMC1NYXJrZXQtV29ydGgtNy0wLUJpbGxpb24tQnktMjAyNy1FeGNsdXNpdmUtUmVwb3J0LWJ5LU1hcmtldHNhbmRNYXJrZXRzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bluetooth 5.0 Market Worth $7.0 Billion By 2027 – Exclusive Report by MarketsandMarkets,"Chicago Sept. 09 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bluetooth 5.0 Market is projected to grow from USD 4.1 billion in 2022 to USD 7.0 billion by 2027 at a CAGR of 11.0% from 2022 to 2027 according to a new report by MarketsandMarkets™.

Warren Buffett has described the cash pile held by his company Berkshire Hathaway as an ""elephant gun."" And while guessing what Buffett may use his elephant gun on for his next purchase may be an exercise in futility it can serve as a screener of sorts when looking for new stock ideas.

Massive brands wide moats recession-proof operations or a Benjamin Graham-worthy valuation -- there are many possible hallmarks of what may qualify a company as a ""Buffett stock.""

Three Fool.com contributors believe The Home Depot (HD -0.64%) Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL 0.74%) and AutoZone (AZO -0.34%) would make great additions to Buffett's portfolio for the long haul.

Too late to reconsider the one that got away?

Josh Kohn-Lindquist (The Home Depot): Trading with a market capitalization of around $300 billion home improvement behemoth Home Depot is on a shrinking list of companies that Buffett couldn't buy outright with his growing cash hoard.

Ranking No. 25 on the Kantar BrandZ Top 100 Valuable Brands List for 2022 it may not be shocking to see Home Depot's total return above 500% over the last decade.

This is the exact type of brand power that Buffett traditionally likes to find with his investments -- look no further than his $160 billion stake in Apple Kantar's No. 1 brand.

So should Buffett consider Home Depot for his next investment? He already did in 2005 -- but it's one of the few picks that seemingly got away from him.

After initially snapping up shares of Home Depot in 2005 Buffett closed his position in full by 2010 as the Great Recession ended. While that's understandable considering the events of the time Home Depot's share price would rise by over 700% since it was sold -- and its dividend increased consistently along the way.

However with its share price having dropped around 27% year to date and trading with an attractive price-to-earnings ratio of only 18 Home Depot is worth a second look.

Recording 7% sales growth year over year for the second quarter of 2022 Home Depot continued to prove that it is striking a beautiful balance between its Pro and do-it-yourself businesses. This balance is of particular importance to investors as it provides stability of sales whether its customers are building new houses or remodeling old ones. This keeps Home Depot's operations surprisingly steady despite the volatility of the housing market.

Perhaps most impressively in the company's Q2 earnings call was its positive same-store comparables in each of its 19 United States geographical regions -- while Mexico and Canada grew even faster.

Consistently lowering its share count over time while steadily boosting its dividend along the way Home Depot has been masterful at returning cash to shareholders.

Despite all of these dividend increases the company still only has a payout ratio of 45% -- meaning that there is plenty of room for further dividend growth.

Home Depot is trading at its lowest P/E of the last decade (outside of a brief moment in March 2020). Its brand power steady operations and consistent cash returns to shareholders make it an alluring pick for the Oracle of Omaha to consider buying again.

A transportation stock Buffett would love

Jeff Santoro (Old Dominion Freight Line): One of the most well-known investments made by Buffett is his stake in railroads. Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) is one of the largest railroad operators in North America owning over 23500 miles of track in 28 states and three Canadian provinces.

In 2009 Buffett was quoted as saying that a bet on the railroads was a bet on America. In that vein I think there's another company that Buffett should consider adding to his portfolio: Old Dominion Freight Line.

For starters Old Dominion has been a massive winner outpacing the gain of the S&P 500 by over 1100%. To put it another way $10000 invested in Old Dominion 10 years ago would be worth $146000 today while the same investment in an S&P 500 index fund would be worth $36000.

A look at the most recent quarter gives some insight into what makes Old Dominion such a great investment. The second quarter of fiscal 2022 was record-setting for Old Dominion. Revenue was $1.7 billion up 26% year over year and 11% sequentially. Net income reached $376 million an increase of 40% compared to the year-ago quarter and 25% over the first quarter.

The company also reached an all-time low on operating ratio which was 69.5% for the quarter. This means that Old Dominion's operating expenses account for only 69.5% of revenue and it's the first time this ratio has ever been below 70%. Considering the inflationary pressures and high gas prices the company is facing this is a very impressive result.

One competitive advantage Old Dominion has over its competition is its purposeful decision to operate with excess capacity. Essentially Old Dominion aims to have the ability to ship 20% to 25% more goods even when that demand doesn't exist.

While this can be a drag on the business during slow times it's a massive advantage when demand surges. Old Dominion's ability to take on the additional demand ends up winning it customers and helping the business gain market share.

Lastly the company prioritizes profitability and growth equally. On the Q2 earnings call management stated ""Any dollar that we invest needs to have an appropriate return with it."" The company has a stated goal of keeping its operating ratio below 70% and doesn't ""want to just grow for growth's sake."" As a shareholder that is music to my ears.

Beat inflation by getting in ""the Zone""

Bradley Guichard (AutoZone): Buffett is one of the most successful investors ever because he doesn't follow trends or jump from stock to stock with every headline. Berkshire Hathaway's holdings are a who's who of solid profit-making companies.

AutoZone is a terrific fit because the company has a tremendous buyback program inflation protection and a fair valuation.

Apple makes up more than 40% of Berkshire's portfolio and its prolific stock buyback program is a tremendous draw. However AutoZone's buyback program is much larger as a percentage of the company's market cap. AutoZone has spent over $30 billion on buybacks since the program's inception in 1998 -- more than 70% of the current market cap. More than $4 billion or 10% of the current market cap was delivered in the last 12 months. You would be hard-pressed to find a company that can match this program pound for pound.

Vehicle prices are through the roof right now and many folks feel priced out of the new and used vehicle markets. Prices have risen so fast that the damage is already done even when inflation ebbs. Automotive parts suppliers like AutoZone could be huge inflation winners as people hold on to their current vehicles. The anticipated demand for parts is a big reason AutoZone's stock is only down 1% this year while the S&P 500 has tumbled 17%.

AutoZone stock is reasonably priced with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio under 19. This is lower than its chief competitor O'Reilly Auto Parts at 22.

AutoZone isn't going to make investors rich tomorrow; however long-term shareholders could have turned a $10000 investment into $40000 in the last five years. Buybacks tailwinds valuation and history indicate that AutoZone is an excellent addition to a diversified long-term portfolio.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2pvbmF0aGFuLWd1c3Qtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzY0NDgyODjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jonathan Gust Obituary (2022) - Olathe KS - Penwell-Gabel Cremations Funerals & Receptions - Olathe,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/jonathan-gust-obituary?id=36448288 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2pvbmF0aGFuLWd1c3Qtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzY0NDgyODjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vdXMxMDMzLmNvbS9wb3B1bGFyLXJlc3RhdXJhbnQtaW4tYmlzbWFyY2stZGVjaWRlcy10by1jbG9zZS1mb3ItZ29vZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Popular Restaurant In Bismarck Decides To Close For Good,"In somewhat of a surprise move MacKenzie River Pizza Pub and Grill in north Bismarck has decided to close its doors for good. According to a message on their Facebook page MacKenzie Pizza Pub and Grill made this announcement on Wednesday September 7th.

The popular restaurant has been serving Bismarck Mandan for nearly 10 years. In the message to their fans MacKenzie River Pizza Grill and Pub said they could no longer maintain the level of service to their customers because of the limited labor available in the Bismarck Mandan area (limited labor or is it the fact that nobody wants to work anymore?).

They went on to thank their loyal customers over the years and especially the ones who stuck with them during the pandemic.

MacKenzie River originally left this message on their Facebook page stating they would be closing temporarily while they gather and train a new staff. The post on Facebook certainly looked as though the restaurant would open again. This was posted on August 18th.

I guess the challenges of trying to find new employees were just too much. I've asked this question before and I'll say it again. ""What are people doing for money these days?"" Is everybody making their money from YouTube and TikTok videos?

One thing for sure I would be extremely leery of opening up a new restaurant or any business for that matter where you need employees these days. It's quite clear that nobody wants to work for their money anymore. Kind of a sad state of affairs.

SOURCE OF WEALTH: Initially petroleum; currently investments

THE MONEY: Irani works out of a Westwood family office. Under the Cedar Tree Investments banner his holdings include hedge funds medical office buildings public storage companies and private equity investments. Over the past year Irani’s portfolio suffered some losses especially in growth companies. He also increased his philanthropic activity and wealth transfers to family members which contributed to the drop in net worth. Irani served as chief executive at Occidental Petroleum Corp. from 1990 to 2011 but has since divested almost entirely from Occidental.

THE BUZZ: Born in Lebanon Irani came to Los Angeles at age 18 with $75 in his pocket to study chemistry at USC. During his tenure at Occidental Irani stabilized the oil giant’s finances and used his overseas connections to expand the company’s reach. Under Irani Occidental’s market capitalization increased to more than $80 billion and Irani was rewarded with hefty compensation packages. He’s a member of the USC board of trustees and has donated heavily to the school including $20 million toward a residential college at USC Village.

The Achuar and Wampis have good reason to oppose further oil extraction: The Northern Peruvian Oil Pipeline which runs through their territories has repeatedly ruptured causing countless spills and constant threats to the environment and safety of their communities.

Nelton Yankur Antich President of the Peruvian Federation of Achuar Nationalities (FENAP) puts it simply: “We want to leave a healthy territory to our future generations.”

Over the years many international oil companies have attempted to enter the territory among them Occidental Petroleum Talisman Energy (now Repsol) and Chilean oil company GeoPark. Due to the steadfast resistance of Achuar and Wampis communities all of these companies have exited the area with minimal oil drilling. Now yet another company state-owned oil company Petroperú is attempting to enter Block 64.

Petroperú recently completed an expensive modernization of its oil refinery in the coastal community of Talara and the company is seeking to drill yet more oil to feed the refinery and recoup its costs.

There is a common thread among these companies that have sought to violate the Achuar and Wampis’ land rights community well-being and environmental health. Each is enabled by financial institutions and the latest institution to dirty its hands with Amazon oil is Vanguard. Vanguard is actively helping to finance Petroperú’s operations by buying its bonds and then selling them to customers in exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

No matter how many oil spills companies like Petroperú cause and no matter how many human rights violations and corruption scandals it generates financial institutions like Vanguard have continued to invest in it as if nothing has happened. This must end. As one of the largest asset management firms in the world Vanguard’s investments can influence the companies it invests in — companies directly impacting Indigenous communities.

Vanguard has stated to investors that it recognizes the importance of engaging with local and Indigenous communities but it has not acted to stop any violations committed by companies in which it invests. It’s time to tell Vanguard to fulfill its responsibility to Indigenous peoples and the planet stop investing in Petroperú and adopt a comprehensive Indigenous rights policy to prevent future violations!

Over the course of the century the population grew 40-fold to nearly four million people. But now for the first time in its history the population of Los Angeles is in decline falling by 204000 between July 2020 and July 2021. LA was once a magnet for investors. But recently many of the area’s corporate linchpins – including aerospace giant Northrop Grumman Occidental Petroleum and Hilton Hotels – have left taking with them high-paying jobs and philanthropic resources.

Worse still conditions in LA today are bordering on the medieval. Anyone visiting some of the most famous districts of urban Los Angeles – notably downtown Hollywood and Venice Beach – sees clear signs of destitution including sprawling homeless encampments vast numbers of people living in vehicles and rampant crime. Last year a UN official compared conditions on LA’s Skid Row a poor downtown neighbourhood to those of Syrian refugee camps. Smash-and-grab thefts at local 7-Elevens and the persistent theft of goods from railyards suggest this is a city that has lost control to the modern version of lawless highwaymen. So-called progressives have long dreamed of transforming the famously sprawled Los Angeles into a dense transit-oriented sun-kissed version of New York. But despite massive corporate and government investment attempts to do this have failed. Rather than a vibrant hipster paradise LA’s urban core is dominated by the homeless the poor government workers and a few creative types – making for an odd juxtaposition of homeless camps and low-rent hotels alongside high-end restaurants and artists’ lofts. Meanwhile newly built luxury apartments have suffered vacancy rates as high as 14 per cent – remarkable in a city so short of housing.

Unsurprisingly some Angelenos have sought to reverse this disastrous course. Earlier this year disgruntled residents united around property developer Rick Caruso in his insurgent campaign to become mayor of Los Angeles. Caruso spent over $24million of his own money on the first round of the election in June. Caruso is the grandson of Italian immigrants whose father founded the successful LA business Dollar Rent a Car. And he has himself been a big player in California for years. His real-estate business founded in 1987 is now worth more than $4 billion. Caruso has built shopping centres all over the metropolitan area from the iconic Farmer’s Market and middle-class San Fernando Valley to the swanky Pacific Palisades. Yet Caruso’s mayoral bid appears to have stalled against the well-organised might of the city’s public-employee-driven political machine.

This is a powerful machine. Last month a grassroots movement opposing progressive criminal-justice reform lost its attempt to recall district attorney George Gascón who has been widely blamed for LA’s lax approach to crime. Recall proponents needed 566857 signatures but despite collecting 715000 only about 520000 turned out to be valid. Thanks to the machine’s backing Gascón’s recall bid failed even though the city last year experienced 397 murders – up 11.8 per cent from the 355 the previous year and a 53.9 per cent increase from the 258 in the pre-pandemic year of 2019. Meanwhile Caruso’s opponent in the second round of the election in November Congressperson Karen Bass is currently ahead by double figures (roughly a quarter of the electorate is still undecided). Like many in California’s ruling political elite Bass comes from the far left. In the 1970s she travelled to Cuba with the Venceremos Brigade an international group of sympathisers with Cuban communism. In 2016 when Fidel Castro died she issued a praise-filled obituary to ‘El Comandante’. More recently Bass has distanced herself from this Castroite past and from policies such as defunding the police. But she can certainly be expected to follow the ‘progressive’ policy agenda typically backed by the city’s public-sector unions.

LA still has a grassroots entrepreneurial economy as is evident in the many small shops and restaurants that fill its mini malls. Many of these are owned and run by immigrants. But 40 per cent of the jobs in Los Angeles County – of which the city constitutes roughly half – pay under $40000. As Toplansky notes in a high-cost city like LA this represents a poverty wage. LA’s rate of working poverty is far higher than in San Francisco’s Bay Area and in neighbouring Orange County. LA’s ‘progressive’ leaders talk endlessly about social justice but the results of their policies have been less than inspiring. South LA site of two of the most devastating riots in American history in 1992 is now poorer in relation to the rest of the city than before those upheavals partly because of rapid deindustrialisation. In a Los Angeles where almost half of the workforce is low-skilled there are few opportunities for the poorest to improve their conditions as higher-paid blue-collar jobs disappear.

Critically the city is also losing its appeal to families and the young. Over the past 20 years Los Angeles County has lost nearly 700000 people under 25 – the biggest per capita decline in youth among all large US counties. In contrast its elderly population has surged by 500000. The Los Angeles Unified School District which is mostly inside the city boundaries has lost over 40 per cent of its student body in just 20 years. Even immigrants who have restored much of the city’s vitality in the past few decades are no longer coming. Between the 2010 and 2020 censuses the number of foreign-born residents in Los Angeles County fell. Veteran GOP pollster and strategist Arnold Steinberg tells me that these economic and demographic trends present major barriers to any reform movement. Today’s LA is far less middle class than it was when Steinberg helped Republican Richard Riordan become mayor in 1993. It is also more heavily minority and older. ‘The game board has totally changed’ Steinberg says. ‘Dick was able to use a Republican base and capture a lot more middle-of-the-road suburban voters.’ Steinberg does not even expect the November mayoral election to be close.

As the GOP has all but collapsed the progressive political machine has only got stronger. As leftist writer Harold Meyerson observed years ago much of LA’s remaining middle class is made up of teachers and other public employees. These with the exception of the police and certain construction unions provide the bulwark of Karen Bass’s support. And this public-sector establishment can mobilise a get-out-the-vote machine that should not be underestimated. According to Gloria Romero a former state senator from east Los Angeles this public-sector political machine has filled the vacuum left behind by weakened neighbourhoods a decline in local churches and the loosening of family ties. At the same time turnouts for city elections have been dropping consistently reaching only 14 per cent in the primary back in June. Meanwhile practices like ‘ballot harvesting’ which allows campaign workers to gather ballots at nursing homes and other facilities with little supervision make progressives all but unbeatable. This proved critical in the first round as Bass behind in the early results ended up with a five-point lead after the late ballots were counted which included those from harvesters.

To be sure given his financial resources Caruso could still mount a comeback. But his campaign is directed almost entirely by professional Democratic campaign consultants whose focus seems to be on winning over moderate to liberal Democrats. With Democrats in Los Angeles outnumbering Republicans more than four to one (double the two-to-one ratio that held when the city elected Riordan) this seems a natural strategy. But recent events mean that looking for help from LA’s remaining bourgeoisie could be unwise. These voters tend to be traumatised by Trump and the Supreme Court abortion ruling. They fear the country is about to be overrun by far-right nationalists. They tend to get their news from the increasingly strident ultra-progressive Los Angeles Times which has endorsed Bass and has attacked Caruso for among other things lacking a ‘climate plan’.

Bass appears to be making inroads in places like the San Fernando Valley a suburban-like expanse north of downtown which was once a Riordan stronghold. It is also home to much of Hollywood’s working population. Overall Hollywood the supreme centre of gentry progressivism has weighed in largely in Bass’s favour seeing her as an ideological fellow traveller. For instance Dreamworks’ Jeffrey Katzenberg has given Bass $850000 and has attacked Caruso for having long been a Republican (he registered as a Democrat in January). This success is somewhat understandable since most leftist liberals live in the city’s bucolic enclaves far from the camps or the smash-and-grab events that other Angelenos endure daily. When crime does emerge in the wealthiest enclaves the well-heeled celebrities enlist private security firms. LA may be dysfunctional for most but it still works for the ultra-affluent.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZpbnRhZ2VuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzA5L2hhbW1lci1mYW1pbHkv0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmludGFnZW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMDkvaGFtbWVyLWZhbWlseS9hbXAvP3ByZWJpZF9hYj1lbmFibGVk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Scandalous Truth About the Men of the Hammer Family,"Armand Hammer II more commonly known by the public as Armie Hammer is a noted American actor in films like Call Me by Your Name The Social Network and The Lone Ranger. Beginning in 2021 he became famous for a different reason when multiple allegations of abuse were made against him by past partners.

What many don’t know however is that he is just one of many in a long line of powerful and extremely controversial men in the Hammer family. Their history has been dragged into the spotlight due to the allegations and it’s a dark saga that includes abuse murder and political scandals.

‘House of Hammer’

Many of these stories about the Hammer family are included in the documentary House of Hammer which was released in 2022. Although the series largely focuses on Armie because of the allegations against him in the last few years it also goes into detail about the family that raised him – in part to show that his actions are not so different from those of his forefathers.

Among those interviewed was Casey Hammer Armie’s aunt who is estranged from the family. She wrote a tell-all book called Surviving My Birthright: The Authorized Version. In both her book and the documentary series she discusses what she calls “multi-generational abuse” at the hands of the Hammer men as well as the dark details of each generation starting with Armand Hammer I.

Armand Hammer I

Armand Hammer I Armie’s great-great-grandfather and the source of his name was a well-known businessman who ran the company Occidental Petroleum. Armand was associated with many scandals throughout his life most notably for providing illegal financial support to President Nixon’s Watergate fund.

When news of the Watergate scandal broke he was able to get out of a prison sentence because of poor health. He took it upon himself to try and clear his name over the next 13 years. In 1989 he was eventually pardoned by President George H.W. Bush conveniently after he made over $100000 in donations to the Republican party.

After his death a biography written in 1996 by Edward Jay Epstein called Dossier: The Secret History of Armand Hammer brought even more dark secrets to the public. He accused Armand of money laundering using artwork to fund Soviet espionage entering the oil business through bribery and creating fake Fabergé eggs.

Julian Hammer

Armand’s heir Julian Hammer was no stranger to scandal either. Armie’s grandfather was arrested for murdering his friend Bruce with a revolver over a matter of a $400 debt. Julian was only 26 years old at the time. While he told others including the police that he was only acting in self-defense according to his wife it was murder. Armand was able to get the charges dropped by paying his lawyer $50000 to cover it up.

Outside of the murder scandal Julian was also known for having house parties that were frequently attended by underage girls. Michael his son and Casey’s brother would attend these parties as well. House of Hammer also shed light on Julian’s abusive behavior toward the mother of his children who he would go on to divorce.

When Julian’s father eventually died it was anticipated that he would leave large sums of money to his family members but as it turned out he was worth much less than previously assumed. Julian’s aggressive reaction to this was to threaten to kill himself and his own children.

Michael Hammer

Another piece of Armand’s legacy to his family was his investment in artwork. He ran the Knoedler Gallery in New York which was eventually taken over by his grandson Michael Hammer after his death. However like every other Hammer man Michael was involved in his own scandal when it was discovered that he was selling fake artwork at the gallery. Allegedly there were over 30 fake paintings sold between 1994 and 2009 while he was in charge.

As much as one would like to assume that the gallery itself was the victim of fraud as they purchased the art from a fraudulent dealer this isn’t the case. They knew that the history behind many of the paintings was false and continued their partnership regardless. The damages from these claims added up to roughly $63 million.

Armie Hammer

House of Hammer heavily emphasizes that Armie is a byproduct of his upbringing as he was raised around many men who were abusive. The allegations against him also fit this pattern as he has been accused of many different abusive acts as well as exhibited an interest in cannibalism culminating in one particular act which led to an investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department.

One of his ex-partners also highlighted in the documentary that Armie seemed to be proud of the actions of his ancestors saying “he didn’t sound like he was ashamed of it. It’s almost like it was a badge of honor.” Although Armie has denied all of the allegations against him his ex-wife has gone so far as to compare him to the serial killer Ted Bundy.

His aunt Casey also said in House of Hammer that she wasn’t surprised that allegations had been brought against her nephew as her family thought that they “could get away with murder; you could do anything. There was no accountability.”",,,

That performance in the fourth quarter that's what it's supposed to look like. The good football teams that's what they look like.""I'm kind of ticked off that the score was as close as it was. That was a pretty dominant performance by our kids.""A glance at the stats reflects that dominance. ECU had a decided advantage in total plays (86-43) first downs (30-12) total yards (531-290) rushing yards (261-15) and time of possession (40:52-19:08). The Pirates also played a turnover-free game while forcing a pair of second-half turnovers.The running game limited to 49 yards in the first half found its footing in the second half as the ODU defense began to wear down Mitchell the Pirates' speedster finished with 160 yards on 18 carries eclipsing 100 yards for the seventh time in his career and scored a pair of touchdowns.Harris more of a bruiser finished with 61 yards on 16 carries and added four catches for 14 yards.""That's a huge thing for us getting Keaton and Rahjai and those guys rolling"" said quarterback who threw for 270 yards and a pair of touchdowns.Houston knows the importance of having the complementary backs both producing.""I'm happy for both of them having that success there in the second half"" he said. ""And we all know that success comes from our offensive line wearing down Old Dominion in the second half.""Mitchell's run provided the catalyst and followed the pattern of many of his game-breaking runs – he now has 15 plays of 20-plus yards and six of 50 or more in the last two years. With the Pirates leading 22-14 and starting a drive at the 19 Mitchell darted through a hole on the left side and left the ODU secondary in his tracks.""I told the line to keep going keep doing what y'all got to do and they kept chopping"" Mitchell said.Houston said he sensed a big play from Mitchell coming soon.""No joke 30 seconds before he popped I'm sitting here thinking 'One of these has got to pop at some point because you felt like you were close"" Houston said. ""Once he got in the secondary you knew what was going to happen. It was a great job by him of being patient all night and not getting frustrated.""Harris cashed in a fumble recovery bymoments later with a 15-yard run for a 36-14 lead.ODU simply didn't have enough firepower to keep up. The Monarchs' rushing game didn't hit positive yardage until midway the fourth quarter and wound up with just 15 yards on 14 attempts. West Virginia transfer Ali Jennings provided the lone ODU threat hauling in eight Hayden Wolff passes for 200 yards including touchdown grabs of 16 18 and 35 yards.ECU countered with a couple of big-play transfers that came up clutch in first-half scoring drives. Georgia transferfinished with nine catches for 93 yards and Toledo transferadded five catches for 89 yards.""They made some crucial catches for us. It's cool to see them do as well as they did but we've got a lot more playmakers that we can disperse the ball to"" Ahlers said.Johnson established himself early with three receptions for 27 yards on an opening 17-play drive that ended with anfield goal. An 11-yard catch on fourth-and-6 moved the Pirates to the 19 but they stalled at the 5.Daffer who missed an extra point and field goal in last week's 21-20 loss received a rousing ovation from the crowd of 36853 and then knocked through a 22-yarder for a 3-0 lead. Daffer also hit a 32-yarder to cap the Pirates' scoring. He had a pair of PAT attempts blocked but Houston pinpointed a protection breakdown as the culprit.""I thought it was pretty special when Owen took the field"" Houston said. ""He's had a tough week. He takes a lot of pride in what he does.

""Playing from behind a lot our serve and pass game didn't hold up long enough"" said head coach Fred Chao. ""They got clusters of points just from their serve and pass game. That was really hard to manage and then when we did get some balls up we weren't really doing good things in the middle of the rally. So you're going to lose in straight sets if you can't control those two aspects.""



Myah Conway was named to the All-Tournament Team after tallying 40 kills (3.08 per set) with 12 digs and 11 blocks. The rightside hitter from Orwigsburg Pennsylvania started all three matches for the Monarchs and hit .273 through 13 sets played. She also added one assist and finished with a team-high 45.5 points over the three days.



East Carolina 3 ODU 0

Conway led the Monarchs (3-6) with 10 kills and 11.5 points in the loss. She registered three blocks made two digs and added one assist while swinging for a .318 clip. Tessa Mati scored eight kills with seven blocks. Teresa Atilano turned in 29 assists with five digs two blocks and a service ace. Jamie Bissmeyer totaled 14 digs on the afternoon and served two aces while Ashley Peroe dug seven balls with five kills and one ace. Hailey Duncan made four blocks (two solo) scored three kills and recorded one dig.



The opening set remained close until Atilano set up Peroe for a score to trim the Pirates' (4-5) lead to 10-9. That opened a 5-1 swing that put ODU in front 13-11 but ECU pulled even at 13-13 thanks to a Monarch service error and a Pirate block. Later the guests scored unanswered points to wrestle back control at 20-17. An ace by Atilano put the Monarchs back in front 23-22 but ECU claimed the next three points and the set.



Both sides continued to trade points in the second set. Down 14-9 ODU rallied to knot the score at 18-18 and again at 20-20. Mati followed a Conway kill with two of her own to give the Monarchs a 23-22 advantage but the Pirates claimed the set with another 25-23 decision.



In the third and final set ODU went ahead 14-13 on a kill by Duncan. Unfortunately the Monarchs couldn't halt a 6-0 spurt from ECU and a 25-17 tally gave the Pirates the match in straight sets.



""The positives are that we can generate points"" added Chao. ""We can actually play hard score points and serve tough. And we can do those in stretches. But the counter to that is we're not doing it long enough or for an extended period of time.""

Glad to be back in my usual weekend spot! I hope everyone had a good Labor Day weekend and week.

As has been the tradition for at least the past six or so years we kick off the NCAA Football Season with a special Saturday Morning Uni Watch where today we bring you all the gridiron uni-action for the past week (actually two weeks since the NCAA now insists upon having a few games from what they call “Week 0”). As always the ever-awesome Terry Duroncelet Jr. will be handling the SMUW main article with Jim Vilk returning once again for his role in the “Five and One” and Uni Trackers Rex Henry Dennis Bolt and Ethan Dimitroff will all be returning to their Power 5 tracking roles. Unfortunately I’ve been unable to contact Kyle Acker who tracked the B1G so going forward we’ll have James Hill taking his place. Please help me welcome James to the SMUW team!

One new thing this year: in past seasons the entire SMUW was contained in one long morning post but under the new Uni Watch format this year the various segments that comprised the whole will be broken out separately so the 5&1 Uni Tracking & Duck Tracking will all have their own posts and each section should be posted early in the morning (so if you come to this post more than an hour after publication all sections should be “live”).

I usually highlight one particular game in the opening spot with TJ handling the remaining games but for opening weekend I defer. Today’s splash features a color-vs-color game (Oregon vs. Georgia) which I (seriously) hope people with color-blindness were able to appreciate. We all know how well a red-vs-green game worked out for the NFL for their inaugural Color Rash game so here’s hoping UGA/UO didn’t bring more of the same.

So I’ll now turn this over to Terry for the 11th Season of …

Sunday Morning Uni Watch

by Terry Duroncelet Jr.

Hello and welcome! I can’t believe it’s been 11 years already since the first SMUW post. This year looks to be really promising for multiple reasons not the least of which is we may actually get a fully-fleshed out season with little-to-no cancellations due to COVID. Before we jump right in there are a few of things I want to note first:

~~~~

-I’m trying something a little new and listing the teams before my actual thoughts. The way it’s to be read is ‘Home/Road’ (if the game is at a neutral site I go by either the colored uni vs white uni matchup or regional favorites. Ex: LSU/Florida State in the Superdome or Georgia/Oregon in Weird Rosebud Stadium (hey if there’s any opportunity to dunk on the Falcons I’m gonna take it. Besides I’m still salty about the Georgia Dome being put on a shirt in 2017). Let me know if you like this format if you’re not a fan and prefer the element of surprise if there’s anything I could do to tweak it a bit I’m open to suggestions.

-As is the norm around this time of year the first week or two is going to be a bit… scuffed kind of like players who cramp up in the ever-increasing-as-the-years-go-on-due-to-global-warming heat of the first late-August/early-September games. This means that there will (sadly) be some missed games spell checks out the wazoo and the occasional stride stutter as I find my footing. HOWEVER! I will do my best to give you as accurate and readable of a rundown as I possibly can!

-I briefly mentioned this last year but as a gentle reminder: I am nonbinary and I exclusively use They/Them pronouns (for those not familiar with pronoun etiquite any instance where you might say “I really like his opinions on the SEC’s uniforms” replace “his” with “their” [or “he” with “they” “him” with “them” etc.] so it would read “I really like their opinions on the SEC’s uniforms”). I’m sure the vast majority of you already know this but I do like to cover my bases.

~~~~

With that out of the way we can finally get this season underway!

__________

Week 0

From Saturday Aug. 27th

• Illinois/Wyoming: ALREADY STARTING OFF STRONG and we’re not even full-tilt into the regular season yet! Contrast Matters: Set the Tone(s) Edition.

• UNC/Florida A&M: I can dig it. Ironically the “proper” ACC matchup that we’re all thinking of (just pretend they’re wearing green pants here) wouldn’t look anywhere near as good even with the green pants because FAMU’s helmets were putting in overtime.

• Northwestern/Nebraska: I feel like I’m watching a scrimmage of the football version of the 1990s Toronto Raptors and I’m 100% here for it. Love the logo flag decals on NU’s helmets (another look thanks to Blaise D’Sylva) and the new uniforms are a home run (INB4 “wrong sport!”). One last thing I want to say about this game: “Week 0” admittedly feels weird because I feel like it’s trying to capture the casual energy of the NFL Preseason but falls short. It almost doesn’t feel real. But for whatever reason this game being in Dublin actually captured that vibe while having actual stakes on the line. IDK I could be making absolutely no sense here but I figured I’d put it out there. Anywho next game!

• FAU/Charlotte: Man so many teams are bringing their A(esthetic)-game this week!

• UTEP/North Texas: Area code decal helmets for the Miners and in a rare turn of events: they actually match on both sides! Not something you see in college football often with one-offs (just pretend that this is a one-off for Boise State). Also the ‘LUKE’ on the back of the helmets is in honor of Luke Laufenberg who passed away from cancer back in August of 2019.

Week 1

From Thursday Sep. 1st

• Pitt/West Virginia: If you want the Cliffnotes version of my thoughts on this game here ya go. It’s wild to think that in the 11 years that I’ve been doing SMUW this is only the 2nd Backyard Brawl that I’ve seen in that time (I think 4th overall counting pre-SMUW). The game did not disappoint and neither did the unis. Pitt looking RAD as always and West Virginia’s Country Roads uniforms are a hit in my books. I’d even go as far as to say that these should get a full home and alternate set and become the new full-time uniforms for the Mountaineers. And for two schools with remarkably-similar color schemes there was no doubt in telling who’s who. A monumental visual upgrade over the last time these two played each other.

• Oklahoma State/Central Michigan: “Barry Sanders combo” for the Cowboys.

• UCF/SC State: Mr. Knightman on Twitter notes South Carolina State was wearing two different striping templates on Thursday night against UCF.

• No shortage of black-and-white games including Wake Forest/VMI Purdue/Penn State (love that railroad stripe BTW) and Mizzou/LA Tech.

• N. Illinois/E. Illinois: Interesting “Hybrid Era” (that’s what I’m calling it) unis for Northern Illinois. I don’t know what eras they’re channeling but I do have this Instagram vid which briefly showcases the unis.

From Friday Sep. 2nd

• ODU/Virginia Tech: The irony of Old Dominion wearing their light blue unis is that it was Virginia Tech that was feeling blue after becoming the second Power 5 team to lose to the Monarchs (the first was… um… Virginia Tech back in 2018) since Old Dominion moved to FBS play some years back.

• Indiana/Illinois: this B1G matchup looks very SEC. Also I’m sure most people know this already but for the uninitiated: the ‘LEO’ on Indiana’s nose bumpers stands for “Love Each Other“. Blaise D’Sylva also notes that the Hoosiers swapped out the decals on their throwback??? helmets from a simple ‘I’ to the current ‘IU’.

• Colorado/TCU: The Big XII matchup from an alternate universe. Colorado wore sort of a late-70s tribute helmet against TCU (what the gold lids normally look like). Closer look from Blaise again.

From Saturday Sep. 3rd

• East Carolina/NC State: First game I tuned into and WOW it is eye-catching! Fun to watch gameplay-wise and uni-wise. ECU’s helmets were a bit distracting tho.

• Oklahoma/UTEP: The Miners reprise their area code helmets for their game against Oklahoma but in white this time.

• Baylor/Albany: Nothing specifically noteworthy uni-wise here but let’s just say that Baylor’s game went quite nice.

• UTSA/Houston: Color-vs-color game between these two and Houston wore some ‘Houston‘ decals on their white helmets. Similar to the ‘Cougars‘ lids from last year.

• Ole Miss/Troy: White helmets for Ole Miss. Not often you see their helmet logo with a navy base (I usually come across the opposite). Speaking of lids someone for Troy got theirs blown off.

• UCLA/Bowling Green: A beautiful-looking game paired with a convincing Bruins win makes this a perfect start to the Rose Bowl Stadium’s 100th year.

• Wyoming/Tulsa: RARE. It has been a hot minute since the last time that I’ve seen Wyoming in gold tops (why is that MW logo patch shaped like a guitar pick?). Definitely their best attempt thus far.

• Tulane/UMass: Full-light blue togs for Tulane.

• North Texas/DALLAS SMU: Dallas alts for SMU. At this point they should just make them their full-timers I love these.

• Ohio State/Notre Dame: Notre Dame had the interlocking ND on their nose bumpers instead of the usual ‘IRISH’ in their game against Ohio State. Not often does this happen (also a closer shot).

• Georgia/Oregon: Color-vs-color matchup between Oregon and Georgia. And before you ask: I’m just as shocked at the score gap as you are.

• The silly signs are out in full-swing. You can catch a bunch of them here. Nice to see that some things never change.

From Monday Sep. 5th

• Georgia Tech/Clemson: I don’t remember if I mentioned this last year (time is an illusion) but Georgia Tech has a really cool captain’s patch treatment.

And with that Weeks 0 and 1 are in the books! Honestly this might be the best-looking opening week in recent memory. Additionally there are undoubtedly plenty of games that I simply could not get to but for any future games if you have a really good lead Twitter is the best place to reach me. As always I gotta give a huge thanks to Blaise D’Sylva for his legendary commitment to the 2456 helmets around the college landscape (at this point that number might be closer to literal than we think if we’re counting everything worn between 2011-to-now). BTW his Twitter has all of the helmets mentioned here and PLENTY more so if you haven’t already peep the link. It’s good to be back and I’ll see you tomorrow. Take care and have a happy NFL-Eve!

Warren Buffett has described the cash pile held by his company Berkshire Hathaway as an ""elephant gun."" And while guessing what Buffett may use his elephant gun on for his next purchase may be an exercise in futility it can serve as a screener of sorts when looking for new stock ideas.

Massive brands wide moats recession-proof operations or a Benjamin Graham-worthy valuation -- there are many possible hallmarks of what may qualify a company as a ""Buffett stock.""

Three Fool.com contributors believe The Home Depot (HD -0.64%) Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL 0.74%) and AutoZone (AZO -0.34%) would make great additions to Buffett's portfolio for the long haul.

Too late to reconsider the one that got away?

Josh Kohn-Lindquist (The Home Depot): Trading with a market capitalization of around $300 billion home improvement behemoth Home Depot is on a shrinking list of companies that Buffett couldn't buy outright with his growing cash hoard.

Ranking No. 25 on the Kantar BrandZ Top 100 Valuable Brands List for 2022 it may not be shocking to see Home Depot's total return above 500% over the last decade.

This is the exact type of brand power that Buffett traditionally likes to find with his investments -- look no further than his $160 billion stake in Apple Kantar's No. 1 brand.

So should Buffett consider Home Depot for his next investment? He already did in 2005 -- but it's one of the few picks that seemingly got away from him.

After initially snapping up shares of Home Depot in 2005 Buffett closed his position in full by 2010 as the Great Recession ended. While that's understandable considering the events of the time Home Depot's share price would rise by over 700% since it was sold -- and its dividend increased consistently along the way.

However with its share price having dropped around 27% year to date and trading with an attractive price-to-earnings ratio of only 18 Home Depot is worth a second look.

Recording 7% sales growth year over year for the second quarter of 2022 Home Depot continued to prove that it is striking a beautiful balance between its Pro and do-it-yourself businesses. This balance is of particular importance to investors as it provides stability of sales whether its customers are building new houses or remodeling old ones. This keeps Home Depot's operations surprisingly steady despite the volatility of the housing market.

Perhaps most impressively in the company's Q2 earnings call was its positive same-store comparables in each of its 19 United States geographical regions -- while Mexico and Canada grew even faster.

Consistently lowering its share count over time while steadily boosting its dividend along the way Home Depot has been masterful at returning cash to shareholders.

Despite all of these dividend increases the company still only has a payout ratio of 45% -- meaning that there is plenty of room for further dividend growth.

Home Depot is trading at its lowest P/E of the last decade (outside of a brief moment in March 2020). Its brand power steady operations and consistent cash returns to shareholders make it an alluring pick for the Oracle of Omaha to consider buying again.

A transportation stock Buffett would love

Jeff Santoro (Old Dominion Freight Line): One of the most well-known investments made by Buffett is his stake in railroads. Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) is one of the largest railroad operators in North America owning over 23500 miles of track in 28 states and three Canadian provinces.

In 2009 Buffett was quoted as saying that a bet on the railroads was a bet on America. In that vein I think there's another company that Buffett should consider adding to his portfolio: Old Dominion Freight Line.

For starters Old Dominion has been a massive winner outpacing the gain of the S&P 500 by over 1100%. To put it another way $10000 invested in Old Dominion 10 years ago would be worth $146000 today while the same investment in an S&P 500 index fund would be worth $36000.

A look at the most recent quarter gives some insight into what makes Old Dominion such a great investment. The second quarter of fiscal 2022 was record-setting for Old Dominion. Revenue was $1.7 billion up 26% year over year and 11% sequentially. Net income reached $376 million an increase of 40% compared to the year-ago quarter and 25% over the first quarter.

The company also reached an all-time low on operating ratio which was 69.5% for the quarter. This means that Old Dominion's operating expenses account for only 69.5% of revenue and it's the first time this ratio has ever been below 70%. Considering the inflationary pressures and high gas prices the company is facing this is a very impressive result.

One competitive advantage Old Dominion has over its competition is its purposeful decision to operate with excess capacity. Essentially Old Dominion aims to have the ability to ship 20% to 25% more goods even when that demand doesn't exist.

While this can be a drag on the business during slow times it's a massive advantage when demand surges. Old Dominion's ability to take on the additional demand ends up winning it customers and helping the business gain market share.

Lastly the company prioritizes profitability and growth equally. On the Q2 earnings call management stated ""Any dollar that we invest needs to have an appropriate return with it."" The company has a stated goal of keeping its operating ratio below 70% and doesn't ""want to just grow for growth's sake."" As a shareholder that is music to my ears.

Beat inflation by getting in ""the Zone""

Bradley Guichard (AutoZone): Buffett is one of the most successful investors ever because he doesn't follow trends or jump from stock to stock with every headline. Berkshire Hathaway's holdings are a who's who of solid profit-making companies.

AutoZone is a terrific fit because the company has a tremendous buyback program inflation protection and a fair valuation.

Apple makes up more than 40% of Berkshire's portfolio and its prolific stock buyback program is a tremendous draw. However AutoZone's buyback program is much larger as a percentage of the company's market cap. AutoZone has spent over $30 billion on buybacks since the program's inception in 1998 -- more than 70% of the current market cap. More than $4 billion or 10% of the current market cap was delivered in the last 12 months. You would be hard-pressed to find a company that can match this program pound for pound.

Vehicle prices are through the roof right now and many folks feel priced out of the new and used vehicle markets. Prices have risen so fast that the damage is already done even when inflation ebbs. Automotive parts suppliers like AutoZone could be huge inflation winners as people hold on to their current vehicles. The anticipated demand for parts is a big reason AutoZone's stock is only down 1% this year while the S&P 500 has tumbled 17%.

AutoZone stock is reasonably priced with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio under 19. This is lower than its chief competitor O'Reilly Auto Parts at 22.

AutoZone isn't going to make investors rich tomorrow; however long-term shareholders could have turned a $10000 investment into $40000 in the last five years. Buybacks tailwinds valuation and history indicate that AutoZone is an excellent addition to a diversified long-term portfolio."

The plan called “Reclaim the Flame” includes $120 million in additional ad spending in the next two years which equates to a 30% annual uptick to its current spend a figure the fast food chain announced is “inclusive of advertising efficiencies we expect to achieve through our ongoing partnership with our new media agency.”

Burger King spent $227.2 million in measured media in the U.S. in 2021 down from $286.2 million the year prior according to figures from Kantar. The chain’s measured spending came in at $101.1 million in the first half of 2022 down from $116.4 million in the same period last year.

The new investment comes about four months after Burger King hired Omnicom Group's PHD as its media agency and OKRP as its creative agency of record. Today’s announcement which summarizes plans shared this week at BK’s annual franchisee convention outlines much of what the two agencies will be charged with putting into market as the fast feeder seeks to spur more traffic to its 7000-plus U.S. locations.

Dade started in the role on September 6 while Ferrell joined the agency on September 1. They both report to Tamara Norman partner and MD of corporate reputation and employee communications at Ketchum.

“Corporate reputation has continued to be a growth engine for the agency” said Norman. “We added them to help support that growth.”

Ketchum has 48 practitioners on its corporate reputation team.

“In corporate reputation our clients need and expect senior counselors to be embedded in their business on an ongoing basis; that is an important element of how we deliver and show up for clients” said Norman. “[Ferrell] brings strong expertise in the employee engagement and ESG areas; and [Dade] has rich media expertise and strong experience managing broadscale corporate reputation campaigns.”

Dade joins Ketchum from WSP U.S.A where he was VP of corporate communications. He worked at the engineering professional services company for two years.

“I admire Ketchum's evolution to an agile consultancy model which is why I'm super excited about joining a team built to meet the increasingly dynamic needs of large organizations” Dade said in an emailed statement.

Earlier in his career Dade worked for Bechtel for two years. Most recently he was global head of external communications and CSR. He also worked for Burson-Marsteller now BCW as an SVP.

Dade began his career in print journalism reporting for The Miami Herald Detroit Free Press The Boston Globe. He also covered the Obama presidential campaign for The Wall Street Journal in 2008. Additionally he was a national correspondent for NPR appearing frequently on MSNBC and CNN.

Ferrell was most recently VP of communications for Softwood Lumber Board. Prior to that she worked for Ogilvy PR/OgilvyEarth as EVP of influence and strategy.

“Building trust with employees customers investors communities and NGOs must factor in all the facets of a company's performance: social environmental and financial” Ferrell said in an emailed statement. “I'm excited to join a strong and expert team at Ketchum who understands just that and is already moving the needle for a roster of world-class clients.""

Another recent addition to Ketchum’s corporate reputation practice is Claire Koeneman who joined as EVP MD and head of financial comms in April.

Ahead of ATS Singapore 2022 Asim Rehman VP demand operation & supply APAC at Digital Turbine gives an overview of the current gaming and esports landscape in APAC and beyond and asserts that the future of both lies in mobile.

How popular are gaming and esports in APAC?

Gaming and esports have seen a significant uptick globally over the past couple of years as people turned to both for distraction and social interaction during repeated periods of lockdown. The surge in video gaming’s popularity in combination with the continued proliferation of mobile usage in emerging markets and rising awareness amongst brands of the opportunities afforded by esports is estimated to see the global esports market climb to USD ~$12.5bn (~£10.8bn) by 2030.

APAC is no exception and has been leading the charge for esports for some time: the region is estimated to have accounted for 51% of global esports viewership in 2017 and 57% two years later. That’s hardly surprising given Asia’s leading role in the cultural and technological development of gaming. APAC’s global share of the esports market is only expected to grow with China (which currently accounts for almost a third of global esports revenue) and South Korea expected to be at the forefront of this expansion.

Despite being enjoyed across platforms mobile is the primary frontier for gamers in APAC unlike other regions where PC and console command the greatest share. Asia boasts the most mobile gamers globally with almost 1.3 billion as of 2021.

How big an opportunity do gaming and esports present to marketers in the region?

Gaming continues to present a significant opportunity for marketers in APAC and across the world. This is particularly true of mobile gaming which has drawn more revenue globally than PC and console combined accounting for half of gaming. With more people than ever enjoying and investing money and time in games on mobile devices the platform represents a prime opportunity for advertisers and marketers to reach their target audiences in the region.

Mobile gaming ticks all the essential boxes for brands and is more consistently accurate than any other advertising surface. On mobile advertisers know that their ads will be seen by a real person in a safe environment drive brand uplift and have the tools to measure viewability and understand consumer sentiment.

Therefore mobile gaming offers prime inventory for brands. And marketers are recognising this – from our position as a preferred SDK partner for several apps (many owned by the world’s leading mobile gaming app publishers) Digital Turbine has seen first-hand how advertisers are experimenting with the channel. The awareness of this opportunity is also reflected by the fact that foremost marketing and advertising companies such as Omnicom Group have launched dedicated gaming groups and teams.

The rise of esports has produced new avenues for brands to connect with their customers and many are already exploring this opening. As of 2022 69% of esports revenue is derived from sponsorships and advertising with high-profile brands like KitKat and T-Mobile signing up as official partners of esports leagues and gaming tournaments.

How are brands already utilising the mobile gaming vertical?

Globally almost every leading brand has incorporated gaming into its marketing mix by now. A lot are investing heavily in mobile gaming inventory which includes ad formats ranging from rewarded video (which are opt-in by nature) to playable ads (which are highly engaging) to in-play ads (which are non-intrusive but rarely clickable/tappable).

Over the past few years Digital Turbine has been working with brands to help them discover the benefits of advertising in mobile gaming and more and more are recognising its value. Our DT Creative Labs services have worked on numerous projects to create ad campaigns dedicated to the mobile environment (such as a recent gamified French’s Mustard campaign).

While interest is high brands are still adapting to mobile alongside other advertising avenues. One tactic we’ve seen is brands repurposing their TV ad on mobile. Using the same creative is a quick way to showcase the brand; the mobile execution provides an opportunity to create a gamification experience within the ad environment to make it more captivating and engaging for the audience.

What key challenges are currently impacting advertising within these verticals?

Following a period of ballooning gaming’s rise is beginning to slow following the easing of restrictions and some signs of a global recession. This deceleration could make some brands slightly wary of exploring the medium but it’s important to note that for now at least gaming and esports are still growing. The same is true for mobile: its growth has become more modest compared to two years ago but app store spending in Asia is still forecast to rise 8% to USD $91B (~£78.6B) by 2026. Only time will tell how economic trends and shifts in spending will impact advertising in these spaces (and more generally) so there is no guarantee that macroeconomic challenges won’t shift ad spending on these channels.

Another pressing challenge is that with more brands entering the gaming sphere audiences are becoming increasingly aware of the creative execution capabilities within gaming. As an audience with high expectations for a creative experience and a historical aversion to disruptive forms of advertising gamers expect brands to communicate to them in ways that benefit them and do not impinge on gameplay. Marketers must concentrate on designing ways to reach out to players without intruding upon the game's immersive experience while providing value such as by rewarding players with additional lives or points for watching a video ad.

What do you think the gaming and esports advertising landscape will look like in a year’s time?

We expect that the market will continue to grow with innovations that transcend beyond pure gaming: with a rise of in-game advertising and the use of virtual currency exchange we believe it's highly likely that similar strategies will be introduced by players like Netflix who are relatively new to the gaming sphere as they explore ways to introduce ad-based models.

We believe that the future of the esports and gaming industries will be powered by mobile. As we’ve mentioned above consumers in Asia are expected to up their spending on mobile apps over the next four years and the mobile gaming segment is set to make up 45% of the total global games market this year. This will be a positive for the space and further reduce barriers to entry for even more gamers and fans to get involved with and enjoy competitive gaming spurring brands to craft and deliver new exciting experiences to engage with their audiences.

Cantwell: “This groundbreaking represents the commitment we made in the CHIPS & Science Act”

Today President Joe Biden traveled to Columbus Ohio to celebrate the groundbreaking of Intel’s new semiconductor manufacturing plant. The company’s expansion marks the first major investment in domestic microchip manufacturing directly linked to the passage of the CHIPS & Science Act championed by Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) Chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce Science and Transportation and signed into law on Aug. 9.

“This groundbreaking represents the commitment we made in the CHIPS & Science Act: to grow good paying jobs in the United States. Intel’s $20 billion plant will employ more than 3000 people and its partnership with the National Science Foundation will quickly put more than $10 million into workforce development at community colleges across the country and into scholarships for semiconductor education” said Sen. Cantwell. “We cannot afford to get left behind in designing and manufacturing the next generation of chips or in educating the semiconductor workforce. That’s why I fought so hard to get this law over the finish line.”

President Biden during the groundbreaking ceremony thanked lawmakers for working to pass the bill including Sen. Cantwell: “While she couldn’t be here Maria Cantwell also deserves a lot of credit. She’s the chair of the Senate Commerce Committee from the State of Washington. Maria was tireless in getting this bill through the Senate.

Intel had previously announced its plans to build a new semiconductor manufacturing plant in Ohio at the beginning of the year. But in July CEO Pat Gelsinger warned that the company would delay its plans to break ground on the $20 billion site if Congress was unable to pass the CHIPS & Science Act which included a $76 billion federal investment to spur domestic semiconductor manufacturing.

In a March 2022 hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee Gelsinger told Sen. Cantwell that vital industries of the future including autonomous vehicles artificial intelligence and advanced mRNA sequencing all hinge on access to high-performance semiconductors.

“All of these depend on the most advanced technologies available they need the highest performance computing at the lowest power capabilities to process these most advanced algorithms” Gelsinger said. “Those kinds of capabilities … will define the future competitiveness of industries globally.”

The CHIPS & Science Act went on to pass the Senate 64-33 and the House 243-187. Shortly after the bill passed Congress several companies including Intel Micron Qualcomm and GlobalFoundries announced plans to build new chip manufacturing facilities in the United States.

Sen. Cantwell was a key architect of the CHIPS & Science Act. She led the conference committee of more than 100 House and Senate members charged with reconciling a final version of the bill rallied lawmakers to ensure the package contained the largest-ever federal investments in innovation and science and joined President Biden for the signing ceremony at the White House last month.

The package invests $76 billion to develop the next generation of semiconductor technologies and to re-establish U.S. strengths in semiconductor manufacturing: $52 billion for competitive grants to spur domestic semiconductor manufacturing plus a 25 percent investment tax credit for domestic semiconductor manufacturing worth an estimated $24 billion.

Semiconductors are the oil of the 21st century – they’re found in a huge variety of products from vehicles medical devices and cell phones to advanced national security technology. Currently only 12% of chips are manufactured in the United States down from 37% in the 1990s.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vbWlhbWlvaC5lZHUvY2VjL25ld3MtZXZlbnRzLzIwMjIvMDkvaW50ZWwtZ2l2ZXMtb2hpby1jb2xsZWdlcy0xNy43LW1pbGxpb24tZm9yLXNlbWljb25kdWN0b3ItcmVzZWFyY2gsLWVkdWNhdGlvbi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Miami to support Intel's semiconductor manufacturing workforce through active partnership with Ohio-southwest Alliance,"Intel’s Ohio Semiconductor Education and Research Program will fund collaborative proposals led by 8 Ohio higher education institutions including the one led by University of Cincinnati with Miami University as one of the core participants.

The new center will lay the foundation for a sustained highly skilled and diverse semiconductor manufacturing workforce by developing comprehensive experiential learning frameworks for both graduate and undergraduate students all while paving the way for leading-edge device technologies through state-of-the-art research.

Intel announced a funding award today for the Center for Advanced Semiconductor Fabrication Research and Education (CAFE) of $3 million over three years. This grant comes on the heels of Ohio State convening the Midwest Regional Network to Address National Needs in Semiconductor and Microelectronics a network of 12 Midwest colleges and universities developing innovative solutions in higher education to support domestic semiconductor education research and workforce needs.

Earlier this year Intel announced it will invest more than $20 billion to construct two new chip factories in Ohio. Intel will invest $50 million directly in institutions of higher education in the state while another $50 million investment from Intel will be matched by $50 million from the National Science Foundation in national funding opportunities.

“The Midwest has extensive experience in serving as an economic driver and support system for some of this nation’s most important undertakings dating back to World War II and beyond” said Ohio State President Kristina M. Johnson. “We look forward to reprising that role and helping America retake its rightful place as a leader in the semiconductor industry through this important collaborative effort to train the workforce of tomorrow. By working together we are much greater than the sum of our parts and the proof of that will be in the highly trained experts who will emerge from this program prepared to take any challenge and succeed.”

CAFE will partner Ohio State with nine other institutions in the state including Ohio University the University of Cincinnati Central State University and Wilberforce University as well as the education consortium Five Colleges of Ohio Inc. composed of Denison University Kenyon College Oberlin College Ohio Wesleyan University and the College of Wooster.

By bringing together these institutions of higher education into a single interdisciplinary center CAFE will provide semiconductor research opportunities to students from diverse backgrounds and disciplines who can share in the access to world-class facilities in an experiential learning environment with a team science approach.

CAFE will be operated at Ohio State by the Institute for Materials Research (IMR) which promotes and supports materials and manufacturing research and initiatives across disciplines and colleges at the university. In addition to IMR operating Ohio State’s premier semiconductor fabrication facilities the institute’s mission is to build large-scale programs that leverage the multidisciplinary strengths of Ohio State. IMR executive director Steven Ringel professor in Ohio State’s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and associate vice president for research is the lead principal investigator.

CAFE will offer exceptional opportunities for undergraduates to learn through hands-on research experience. Manufacturing internships for students as well as graduate and postdoctoral research associateships will further immerse and train tomorrow’s semiconductor workforce in a variety of real-world settings.

The new research center’s multidisciplinary diverse and interactive culture will also be enhanced through its coordination with the National GEM Consortium and the Ohio Five-OSU Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE) program.

The center will create new training programs and explore next-generation semiconductor device fabrication with activities aligning with many areas of strength within Ohio State’s semiconductor ecosystem: materials synthesis characterization device design and processing.

“The research we will carry out as part of the Intel-funded CAFE center will benefit our students faculty and staff who are engaged in semiconductor research tremendously” said Ringel. “The structure of CAFE will enable the convergence of both graduate and undergraduate students in an environment of interdisciplinary research and experiential learning that will provide exciting opportunities for current and future generations of students to get in on the ground level and cultivate the future of America’s silicon heartland.”

At Ohio State access to world-class facilities related to semiconductor fabrication and research will afford experiential learning environments with a team science approach. Primary shared facilities central to CAFE’s research and education efforts at the university include Nanotech West Laboratory the Semiconductor Epitaxy and Analysis Laboratory the NanoSystems Laboratory and the Center for Electron Microscopy and Analysis.

“We are excited to have this opportunity in Ohio’s semiconductor ecosystem so diverse teams of faculty staff and students can showcase their talent by having access to state-of-the-art facilities and research experts in semiconductor fabrication” said IMR Director of Innovation Jay Sayre who leads the CAFE student experiential plan. “This new unique learning experience will introduce undergraduate and graduate students and will inspire them to seek new horizons of research in academic labs and create a sustained pipeline of talent entering the semiconductor industry.”

CAFE anticipates broadening its reach to Ohio colleges and universities currently not part of the initial effort as it evolves its core program through event series that include lab training sessions and student-centric symposiums."

FRISCO TX – Offensive production has been up and down for the Tulsa Drillers during their series this week in Frisco. After scoring 11 runs in a game one win Tulsa had been held to a combined 3 runs in two straight losses.

For the fourth game of the series on Friday night the bats came back to life as the Drillers produced a six-run inning a five-run inning and a three-run frame to again reach double figures in runs and post a 14-2 victory over the RoughRiders.

BOXSCORE

The two teams have now split the first four games of their six-game series at Riders Field.

A large portion of Tulsa’s offense came from the bat of Leonel Valera. The shortstop finished 3-6 and drove in five runs. He now has nine RBI in the series.

Pitching was the story in the early portion of the game as starters Lael Lockhart and Mason Englert were both dominant through the first four innings. Frisco had one hit and a walk for just two base runners in its first four at-bats against Lockhart while Tulsa had just one hit for a single base runner against Englert.

A bout of wildness from the Frisco right-hander helped the Drillers produce the game’s first offense with their three runs in the fifth. Andy Pages led off the inning with a base hit but he was still at first base with two outs. Englert who was making just his second Double-A start uncharacteristically walked the next two batters to load the bases before committing a balk that allowed Pages to come home with the game’s first run.

With runners still at second and third Leonel Valera lined a double into the left field corner that scored both and gave Tulsa a 3-0 lead.

A walk in the bottom of the fifth also led to Frisco’s first run in the game. Staked to the three-run lead Lockhart walked the inning’s leadoff batter. After a one-out single put runners at first and second the Tulsa lefthander got his fifth strikeout of the game for the inning’s second out.

At that point manager Scott Hennessey called on Guillermo Zuniga from the bullpen and he surrendered a soft liner off the bat of Jonathan Ornelas that dropped into shallow centerfield for a run-scoring hit. Zuniga then got grounder from Kellen Strahm that ended the inning with the Drillers leading 3-1.

Tulsa put the game away with its six-run outburst in the seventh inning. The first three batters of the inning reached safely against reliever Kevin Gowdy on two walks and hit. After a run-scoring ground out from Valera made it 4-1 Tulsa got two-run singles from Justin Yurchak and Andy Pages. Kody Hoese capped the big inning and made it 9-1 with an RBI single.

After Frisco scored an unearned run in the bottom of the eighth Ryan Ward doubled and scored in the ninth for Tulsa before Kenneth Betancourt and Jeren Kendall added run-scoring hits.

Valera capped his big night with a two-run single to close out Tulsa’s big offensive night.

HIGHLIGHTS AND HAPPENINGS:

*Tulsa totaled 15 hits in the game with Valera Pages and Kendall getting three hits each.

*It was a good and bad night for Lockhart. He was charged with just one run on two hits but he came one out short of reaching five complete innings and qualifying for the victory. Lockhart was removed after throwing 78 pitches. His top pitch count of the year is 82 pitches which he has reached in three of his past five starts.

*Zuniga worked 1.1 shutout innings to get the win and improve his season record to 4-3.

*Yurchak’s seventh-inning single allowed him to up his on-base streak to 22 consecutive games. Since July 1 Yurchak has hit for a .346 average.

*The Drillers set two franchise records in Thursday’s loss to the RoughRiders. A home run from Valera was the 185th of the season for the Drillers the most in franchise history topping the 184 homers hit by the 2018 squad. In addition Tulsa pitchers combined for 7 strikeouts in the game giving the Drillers staff a franchise record of 1242 strikeouts for the year topping the previous record of 1240 set by the 2019 staff.

UP NEXT:

Two of Oracle’s most technologically advanced sports partners came together for a thrilling challenge on the waters of the French Riviera. Max Verstappen and Sergio Pérez teamed up with U.S. SailGP Team driver and fellow Red Bull athlete Jimmy Spithill to see if their talent could upset overall season leader Tom Slingsby of Australia.

Fresh off a win at his home event Verstappen alternated with Pérez taking turns onboard the U.S. team’s high-speed hydrofoiling F50 catamaran taking on the two-time SailGP Champion Slingsby. They first let the experienced SailGP drivers go head-to-head and experience the full force of a SailGP race – with the U.S. showing early form over the Aussies – before taking the wheel and participating in time trials to see if they had what it takes to drive the F50.

The two teams came together in Saint-Tropez ahead of this weekend’s Range Rover France Sail Grand Prix and F1’s Italian Grand Prix.

Both SailGP and Oracle Red Bull Racing rely on the performance of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to provide them with data analysis that sharpens race strategies and helps the teams make more informed split-second decisions. Oracle Red Bull Racing’s data-driven strategy has been a key component of the team’s success on the track this year so Verstappen and Pérez took the time to study SailGP’s data and get key insights from other teams before going up against the Aussies on the water.

U.S. SailGP Team CEO and driver Spithill said: “I think when they were told they were going to go on the water they didn’t expect these boats. They certainly looked at them with a little bit of shock because the boats look more like an aircraft. I think they were blown away by the technology.

“Although they are on the road and we are on the water the one thing that we do share is how data driven both sports are and how much the athletes rely on making decisions and using that data. It is just fundamental. If you look at strategies – how we make decisions on the water how they make decisions on a race track – we study the data hard we use it real-time and there is a lot of it but we are both very fortunate to have a partner like Oracle that gives us that sort of a competitive advantage.”

Verstappen said: “I’ve had a pretty incredible experience; I’ve never done anything like it. We do a lot of really cool things at Red Bull and this is definitely one of them. SailGP is extremely professional and the race boats are much bigger than expected it was impressive to see the aerodynamics and the foils. It was really interesting to listen to the whole team communicate on the boat when I’m in the car I only communicate with one person. We also went to the Oracle Insights Center and the one thing that really interested me in SailGP is that all the data is available to everyone. And of course in our sport that’s not allowed and it’s not possible but still you have so much information to make the right calls and strategy calls.”

Pérez said: “To have that opportunity to experience a new sport was incredible it was something unique. We are doing some racing but not on the track – on the water. Like every sport when you see it from the outside it is so different when you actually jump into it. It is so impressive I have a lot of admiration for what these guys do. I am very curious about it how the team uses the data and of course the technology – it is great to learn about other sports. Our sports are similar in the way we interact with the teams and with the strategists we have a lot more similarities in our sport than I first thought. The beauty of F1 is that you are constantly hiding your data and strategy from other teams and that information is so important to you. I find it very unique that you are able to see the data from other teams in SailGP that is something very different from our sport.”

At the end of the day the U.S. team’s new talent clearly gave them an advantage over the Aussies something Spithill’s team will aim to carry into the race weekend in Saint-Tropez September 10-11.

The SailGP and Oracle Red Bull Racing teams will reunite at Oracle CloudWorld on October 17-20 in Las Vegas to showcase how Oracle Cloud Infrastructure delivers a competitive advantage that has made SailGP the most exciting sailing competition in the world and fueled Oracle Red Bull Racing’s lead in this season’s Formula One Constructors’ Cup standings.

United States (Fed. Cl. Aug. 8 2022) expanded the government procurement community’s understanding of the jurisdiction of the COFC over Other Transaction Agreements (“OTAs”). After initial hurdles the court now appears prepared to hear challenges to agencies’ OTA award decisions[1] although the government still has greater latitude (and thus greater discretion) in its evaluation methods than in FAR-based procurements.

Federal agencies with OTA authority are using it on an increasing number of acquisitions because OTAs encourage responses from non-traditional vendors support supporting dual-use projects and encourage flexible quicker and cheaper solution design and execution.[2] In other words agencies view OTA authority as ideal for acquiring solutions that depend on the ingenuity of the marketplace.

Historically challenges to OTAs were limited at both the Government Accountability Office (""GAO"") and the federal courts. Currently the GAO will not consider protests challenging the evaluation of OT awards (for the reason that OTAs are not procurement contracts). However GAO will entertain protests challenging the agency’s improper use of a non-procurement instrument to procure goods or services. In other words the GAO will consider whether the agency has failed to comply with its statutory OT authority. See Oracle America Inc. B-416061 May 31 2018 (holding that GAO only has “jurisdiction to hear the challenge to the Army’s exercise of its other transaction authority” but not to the manner of competition because the contract itself is not a “procurement contract.”).[3]

In 2019 COFC signaled that it might have jurisdiction over an OTA. In Space Exploration Techs. Corp. v. United States 144 Fed. Cl. 433 (2019) the parties agreed that the phase 1 prototype OTAs were not procurement contracts but that the phase 2 procurement would result in a procurement contract. The protester argued that the Air Force’s evaluation and award of the phase 1 prototype OTAs were “in connection with” the phase 2 procurement contract. The court disagreed finding that the two OTAs were “separate and distinct” solicitations and acquisition strategies.” On this basis the court concluded that COFC lacked jurisdiction under the Tucker Act (14 U.S.C. § 1491) and transferred the case to California federal district court. The federal court applying an Administrative Procedure Act standard of review determined that the Air Force’s actions were not arbitrary or capricious and denied SpaceX its requested relief. From Space Exploration we can infer that where COFC finds that an OTA is issued “in connection with” a procurement COFC will find it has exclusive jurisdiction under the Tucker Act.

In 2021 protesters started to see light at COFC when in Kinemetrics Inc. v. United States 155 Fed. Cl. 777 (2021) the COFC maintained jurisdiction over the challenge because the “solicitation had a direct effect on the award of a contract.” However the Kinemetrics court limited its review to “whether the government followed its own process” and denied Kinemetrics’s challenges to the agency’s evaluation.

All of these cases led to the COFC’s recent decision in Hydraulics in which the government again argued that the court lacked jurisdiction because the OTA prototype effort[4] was not connected to a procurement or a proposed procurement.[5] The court denied the government’s motion and kept jurisdiction finding on the facts that the OTAs were connected to determining a government need the assessment of need was an early step in the government procurement process and the court had jurisdiction over challenges in connection with a procurement or proposed procurement.

Unfortunately for the protester after taking jurisdiction the court nevertheless denied Hydraulics’s various challenges to the agency’s evaluation and award decision finding that the protester had failed to show that the agency’s evaluation lacked a rational basis. In this respect the court’s newfound jurisdiction remains still a small part of the bid protest universe. While contractors challenging FAR-based procurement contracts have both the FAR and extensive case law as checks on the agency’s evaluation methodology in OTAs agencies remain free to write their own standards. Thus the court’s ability to review may not bring much relief. However given that this area is wide open a disappointed contractor with good facts may wish to raise a challenge and plant its flag.

[1] Note: These decisions were all challenges to the authority exercised by the relevant Department of Defense agency under 10 U.S.C. § 4022 (which prior to renumbering was 10 U.S.C. § 2371(b)). While the court in Hydraulics did not limit its jurisdiction to challenges under this statute OTA statutes vary by agency.

[2] There are 11 federal agencies with OTA authority although not all of those agencies use that authority regularly.

[3] See also MD Helicopters Inc. B-417379 April 4 2019 (dismissing protest challenging the agency’s evaluation of proposals and award decision).

[4] The Kinemetrics parties agreed that “OTAs themselves are not procurements.”

[5] 28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(1) grants the Court of Federal Claims and federal district courts jurisdiction over solicitation and award challenges as well as “any alleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or a proposed procurement.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2NvcnBvcmF0ZS1wZXJmb3JtYW5jZS1tYW5hZ2VtZW50LWNwbS1zb2Z0d2FyZS1tYXJrZXQtMjAyNi1iZW5lZml0cy1vZi1jcG0tc29mdHdhcmUtdG8tYm9vc3QtZ3Jvd3RoLS0tdGVjaG5hdmlvLTMwMTYyMDM1OS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Corporate Performance Management (CPM) Software Market 2026 Benefits Of CPM Software to Boost Growth ...,"However the need for extensive technical training security constraints and high costs associated with CPM software will challenge the growth of the market participants.

The survey of 2000 Americans gave respondents a list of over 40 entrepreneurs from the last 50 years and asked them to select those who’ve made the biggest positive impact on society.

Respondents chose the founders of Microsoft Amazon and Apple to top the list with Elon Musk — founder of SpaceX — and Mark Zuckerberg — founder of Facebook — rounding out the top five.

Following them respondents chose Oprah Winfrey (co-founder of Oxygen founder of O The Oprah Magazine) Melinda Gates (co-founder of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation) and Sam Walton (founder of Walmart and Sam’s Club).

Larry Page (co-founder of Google) and Ted Turner (founder of Cable News Network (CNN) completed the top 10 list.

Conducted by OnePoll on behalf of Herbalife Nutrition the survey asked respondents about the impact of modern entrepreneurs compared to their historical counterparts and looked at the characteristics that made a good entrepreneur.

Before seeing the pre-selected list of modern entrepreneurs respondents were asked to write the names of the entrepreneurs they feel are the “greatest of all time.” Among others historical luminaries like Henry Ford Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Edison were featured multiple times in respondents’ answers.

The survey found that 48% of respondents believe modern entrepreneurs are more influential than their historical counterparts — while 20% said the opposite believing modern entrepreneurs are actually less influential.

“Entrepreneurs change our world for the better with their out-of-the-box thinking and their inventions have a great impact on our lives and society” said Ibi Montesino executive vice president of distributor and customer experience at Herbalife Nutrition.

Still despite the positive impact respondents think entrepreneurs have only 38% said they’re likely to pay attention when entrepreneurs make headlines in the news.

The survey was also conducted in Mexico and Israel and the results revealed some interesting differences in how respondents view entrepreneurs.

A third of U.S. respondents see entrepreneurs as role models compared to 74% of those in Mexico and 60% of respondents in Israel.

For those who do see entrepreneurs as role models respondents said the entrepreneur’s personal accomplishments (24%) and their contributions to society (22%) mattered the most.

To be a successful entrepreneur respondents globally said that it takes specific character traits (19%) having one great idea (15%) and a commitment to hard work (14%).

When asked what those specific character traits are respondents said creativity (31%) and intelligence (30%) were the most important. This was followed by confidence and motivation (tied at 29%).

Forty-five percent of all respondents have their own aims to become an entrepreneur — and 42% believe they have what it takes to be successful in that endeavor.

Across all three countries 42% even said they have a “big” idea that could turn into a successful business — which might be why respondents think having “one” great idea is such an important trait in a successful entrepreneur.

“While there are numerous character traits that go into making a successful entrepreneur the ones we work with day in and day out all have a common theme they demonstrate a commitment to hard work and surrounding themselves with a supportive community” said Montesino.

You quit school and take your idea to Sand Hill Road where VCs shower you with cash. Your company grows quickly. You eventually get a valuation of over $1 billion and you go public to great fanfare.

That’s the mythology anyway but what if there were another way? What if you could grow a $1 billion company without the outside investment the crazy sales and marketing spend the pressure to grow ever faster?

Zoho a company that has a broad set of front- and back-end business software has defied that growth and investment stereotype to great success. Zoho reports that revenue last year exceeded $1 billion — although as a private entity it didn’t supply an exact number. Yet it has never taken so much as a penny of external investment.

By developing the company on its own terms Zoho has been able to build a strong internal culture steeped in R&D and product development growing slowly but steadily without having to deal with any investor interference whatsoever.

Zoho’s product catalog which exceeds 50 products covers everything from a traditional office suite to business intelligence finance sales and marketing customer service and too many other software categories to list here. Using a freemium model to drive usage it competes with giants like Salesforce Google Microsoft and Oracle yet has found a way to thrive in spite of such a harsh competitive landscape.

I spoke to founder and CEO Sridhar Vembu along with some industry experts to get a better sense of how Zoho has grown on its own terms and how this “little engine that could” keeps rolling along.

Why Zoho is different

Back in 2005 Zoho launched with Zoho Writer a product that caught the attention of TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington. Vembu said that Arrington’s article was the earliest coverage of the company. Since then Zoho has released dozens of products and he said the vision from the start was to slowly expand the set of applications.

“That was the plan from the beginning. We actually wanted to build a full suite. In other words when we started Zoho Writer we knew we’d be building a spreadsheet a presentation application [and all of that]” he said. “But we had a sequence. We knew we could not build it all at once.”

Laurie McCabe co-founder and partner at SMB Group a research and consultancy firm that focuses on technology geared toward small and medium businesses said Vembu’s vision is a big reason for the company’s success.

“Zoho has a very visionary founder with deep convictions that have put it on a very different path than its competitors” she told TechCrunch adding that on the product side Zoho provides “sophisticated yet easy-to-use and integrated software for lots of functions at a low price.”

Brent Leary founder and principal analyst at CRM Essentials who keeps a close eye on Zoho said that the company has taken its own unique route to success.

“Zoho’s ability to stay to true their core principles without being swayed by outside forces is why I think they’ve been able to be as successful as they have been” he said. “Not taking VC money or going public allowed the company to do things in a manner and time frame that didn’t erode the culture and heart of the company.”

From a numbers perspective Zoho has over 11000 employees spread out across the world working with a whopping 80 million users overall. More than 600000 businesses pay the company.

Early on Zoho concentrated exclusively on SMBs but it’s moved up to midmarket and even the enterprise in recent years.

“SMBs still drive the business” Vembu said “but now as the whole platform is maturing larger enterprises are coming to us. And so we have a very good midmarket to enterprise business that’s growing on top of the whole SMB business.”

While it offers free products that appeal to small business users who can test the product without paying the company can funnel these users into paying customers as they reach certain user-number thresholds or require more sophisticated features. Companies that want access to the whole Zoho product catalog can sign up for Zoho One or access certain app bundles around CRM finance human resources and so forth.

Vembu said that while the market is shifting SMBs remain key:

If you asked me five years ago SMBs would have been the vast majority of our business. Today a good 25% to 30% of our business is coming from the midmarket and enterprise. And that part is growing faster too so we are growing to be an enterprise company with a very strong SMB base.

Leary said the slow pace of change is consistent with the way Zoho operates more generally — not paying attention to how other tech companies operate.

“It may not be moving at the speed you typically see from most enterprise software vendors taking this path and Zoho may do things (or not do things) in a way that is very nontraditional as they move upstream but they have thought it out and have decided they’d prefer to do things that are more aligned with their culture than to stay true to any Silicon Valley [growth] playbook” he said.

Capitalism with a conscience

One of the things that consistently comes up about Zoho is that it has a unique culture. Marc Benioff certainly talks a lot about responsible capitalism something that Vembu tries to live by with his company whether it’s how he operates internally or how he gives back to the community (and the world at large).

In particular Vembu sees his company as a vehicle for addressing inequality in the world either through education or jobs even if he doesn’t see it through a political lens.

“I don’t consider myself from the political left far from it but I do feel strongly about issues like inequality. We need a social contract. We need to have a social compact between the rich and the poor between the companies and the employees all of that” he said.

These are not just words for him. Vembu now lives in India where he helps the local community in a variety of ways. “I moved to a rural village [in India]. I like rural living and I also want to do projects to create jobs create talent all of that. So we run a school. We run a health clinic here. We are building a hospital and we also have a program called Zoho Schools of Learning (formerly Zoho University)” he said.

The latter is a program that has been running for 17 years. It’s designed to give students the knowledge to work at a company like Zoho which recruited 250 students last year. Zoho pays them a stipend and teaches them about various aspects of technology like programming and design. If students make it through the program — and Vembu said most do — they get a job offer from Zoho.

The company also puts its employees front and center as part of this overall philosophy. As an example Vembu said that when the pandemic hit in 2020 he vowed to avoid layoffs no matter how it played out. He acknowledged that if the economic impact dragged out Zoho might eventually need to cut salaries but it never came to that. And he said his attrition rate stayed low during the “Great Resignation” something he attributed to the way his company operates.

Leary agreed that Zoho’s employee-focused policies could lead to a more loyal workforce overall. “Zoho takes a long-view approach and lets its employees develop in a way that not only allows them to grow professionally but also as a close-knit team that seeks to impact their community in a variety of meaningful ways.”

Vembu said this is all consistent with his overall beliefs about running a company — pouring money into developing products while taking some of the profits and giving back — and he sees that as being directly related to staying independent.

“It’s also coming from us staying private because a lot of our profit we earned from business is going into this. It’s going into R&D. It’s going into more figuring out complicated technology. And it is going into all these charitable activities. One thing it is not going into is buying a private jet for myself. That’s right; it’s not going into that because I’m not interested in it” he said chuckling.

No company is perfect but Zoho has managed to grow over the last 17 years without having to answer to outside investors while trying to stay true to its internal core philosophy. And that’s a pretty unusual path for tech companies to take."

Headquartered in Greenville N.C. Accu Copy does business under the AccuLink name to deliver commercial print direct mail and promotional marketing products while its AccuFlex division focuses on the production of flexible packaging products. The acquisition of both AccuLink and AccuFlex expands Taylor’s reach and offers immediate growth opportunities in multiple core categories.

“AccuLink is an ideal fit for The Occasions Group. It complements our business model perfectly and strengthens our capabilities for our distributor and reseller partners” says Nate Mullikin enterprise leader at Taylor. “Like us AccuLink has invested heavily in the digital print space. They operate one of North Carolina’s leading white-label e-commerce fulfillment facilities as well as a wide range of binding finishing and direct mail services in-house something we believe to be a long-term growth area.”

AccuLink also has the ability to produce dye sublimation products in quantities as low as one. “Their ability to efficiently and profitably produce personalized giftable items is a game-changer for us. All of our customers are asking for more capacity in this area and it’s especially gratifying to be able to offer this capability to our many trade partners” says Cory Hanna president of The Occasions Group. “It’s something we’ve been wanting to expand upon for a while and we’re thrilled to see that type of talent and expertise join our team.”

While AccuLink was founded in 1980 the AccuFlex division was created more recently in 2020. Here again fit was the primary consideration behind the acquisition. “Taylor is aggressively growing its flexible packaging business and AccuFlex offers an obvious growth opportunity for our Prime Labels & Packaging group” adds Troy Barnes president of Taylor’s consumer labels business unit. “We see a big growth curve ahead for flexible packaging and we’re especially intrigued by what they’re doing in regard to sustainability.” Barnes notes that AccuFlex is leading the way in the use of bio-based packaging films and closures along with e-beam curing technology resulting in flexible packaging products that are both recyclable and compostable. “Taylor is committed to sustainable business practices and AccuFlex’s experience with bio-based packaging advances our goals in that area.”

Tom O’Brien founder and owner of Accu Copy points to the many synergies related to the acquisition. “Taylor has been a valued supplier for us since our founding in 1980 and I honestly can’t think of a better partner” says O’Brien. “Our respective product lines and technologies mesh perfectly but there’s also the cultural element. Taylor has an entrepreneurial spirit and is privately held just like Accu Copy so they’re always investing for the future. I’m excited to see what we can accomplish together.”

PANW,Palo Alto Networks,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlY3VyaXR5bWFnYXppbmUuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzk4MzEyLXdoeS1jeWJlcnNlY3VyaXR5LXNob3VsZC1iZS15b3VyLXBoeXNpY2FsLXNlY3VyaXR5LXByaW9yaXR50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why cybersecurity should be your physical security priority,"Too often chief security officers (CSOs) look at their role through two separate lenses: physical security and cybersecurity. The policies and programs for physical security systems differ drastically from those required for cybersecurity.

And yes most CSOs are aware that protecting physical facilities and assets helps prevent cyber breaches and this logic also works inversely. A recent study by IBM shows that in 2022 the cost of a cyber breach is now over $4M per incident; combine that with data from Palo Alto Networks showing that IP cameras are the most vulnerable enterprise devices and it’s clear that CSOs have an imperative to focus on both physical and cybersecurity.

Applying the proper cybersecurity practices to physical security systems provides organizations a host of new benefits including increased overall security with enhanced operational and cost efficiencies. Siloing an organization’s cybersecurity and physical security only creates more risk.

Take for example the securing of IoT and networked edge devices. Most enterprises have strict corporate policies and compliance requirements for end-point devices and servers. Every time a new computer or software is connected to the network strict cyber-hygiene guidelines follow including frequent software and firmware updates strong password creation and rotation backups and other simple cybersecurity practices.

These practices are a mainstay across almost all enterprises but unfortunately most enterprises do not extend these same policies and practices to edge devices residing on physical security networks. Given that today’s physical security systems are made up of thousands of edge and IoT devices cybercriminals can potentially utilize thousands of vulnerable entry points to compromise an enterprise. Unless an explicit exemption is given all physical security devices should be maintained and secured according to corporate governance policies.

Truth be told companies are less adept at securing peripheral IoT devices than they are at securing physical spaces or the network itself. Not only does this fact impact an organization’s cyber and physical security posture it could also impact its cybersecurity insurance policy.

If a vulnerable physical security system is found to be the source of a cybersecurity breach and is not maintained appropriately with firmware updates and password rotations cyber insurance claims can potentially be denied. This means if a bad actor exploited a network using a default password or out-of-date firmware traced to a physical security device the burden of responsibility might lie solely on the enterprise. The cost of such a breach could be well into the millions not including excluding the cost of lost stakeholder trust and reputation.

As cybersecurity insurance claims rise comprehensive coverage has become harder to obtain. Premiums are rising documentation requirements have exploded and organizations have less protection than in the past.

Cyber insurance policies must be renewed yearly and will soon likely account for the changing physical security and IoT landscape in making policy decisions. That is why cybersecurity insurance should not be relied on as a reason to skimp on proper cyber-hygiene practices. It is up to the enterprise to adopt and create proper security protocols to protect its digital and physical assets.

One challenge in creating and deploying such policies is that they must be done at an enormous scale. Today networked door locks and security cameras incorporate processors and operational firmware that needs to be tracked managed and updated to maintain proper cyber hygiene. It is not uncommon for large enterprises to have hundreds to thousands of these devices far surpassing the number of computers and servers most CSOs are accustomed to managing.

Maintaining the cyber-hygiene for potentially thousands of devices is virtually impossible for even the most experienced security teams. Luckily many automated solutions are available to help manage secure update firmware ensure device password compliance and provide IoT device certificates at scale.

Innovative IoT security platforms provide vulnerability scanning device classification remediation and repatriation at scale allowing organizations to quickly identify and fix cybersecurity vulnerabilities within minutes not months.

For example certificate-based network access control (NAC) is critical to keeping the right IoT devices online. It would take an inordinate amount of time for security teams to manually verify and update every certificate for every networked device. Automated device certificate managers deliver centralized life cycle management for 802.1x TLS and OPC-UA certificates for all devices. With a click of a button the technology validates certificate presence age and validity and updates and manages certificates on virtually any number of IoT and security devices anywhere.

The same is true of device firmware updates. Updating a device’s firmware is an important cyber-hygiene practice that often goes overlooked since doing so manually is a tedious manual and complex effort especially when an organization has deployed different devices from multiple vendors. An automated device firmware manager identifies which connected IoT devices require firmware updates and will automatically update the firmware if necessary. Secure “chain-of-trust” methods ensure that the firmware being updated is from a trusted uncorrupted source.

Lastly default and enterprise-wide passwords provide the simplest path to hacking any IoT device. And just as employees have passwords for their computers physical security devices should not be exempt. Innovative password management technology provides a viable automated approach to verify that strict password policies and compliance requirements are being met for all distributed devices.

Such a solution verifies IoT devices are not using default or commonly used passwords which are a proven network vulnerability to cyberattacks. Furthermore automated password verification helps ensure compliance with many standards including PCI NERC NIST etc. ensuring that surveillance networks cannot be compromised because of lenient password standards.

It is also important to note trending discussions on the liabilities associated with cybersecurity breaches. In fact Gartner predicts that 75% of CEOs will be personally liable for cyber-physical security incidents by 2024.

This is cause for concern in C-suites across all businesses and organizations that should also be resonating loudly within all professional security circles. Excuses related to overburdened operations and budgets lack of technical know-how and/or ignorance of the law will simply not be sufficient anymore — not when your CEO’s neck is on the line and you’re responsible for protecting it.

This is a new and compelling incentive to resolve the longstanding and emerging challenges CSOs and CISOs face to better secure professional security and enterprise networks.

The good news is that there are automated IoT security technologies that do the very thing that CSOs wish they could do but are unable to — apply an enterprise’s cybersecurity policies to physical security devices at scale.

These automated security solutions help tangibly merge cyber and physical security providing a holistic approach to security wherein physical security protects cyber assets and vice versa. This leads to improved costs and operational efficiencies reduced exposure to organizational and personal liabilities reduced cyber breaches fewer disruptions to physical security operations compliance with cybersecurity insurance requirements and more.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNybi5jb20vbmV3cy9jbG91ZC9taWNyb3NvZnQtcm9sbHMtb3V0LW5jZS1kaXNjb3VudC1idXQtY29udHJvdmVyc3ktcmVtYWluc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft Rolls Out NCE Discount But Controversy Remains,"Microsoft Rolls Out NCE Discount But Controversy Remains

‘We just would like for Microsoft to give us portability for customers’ Lane Shelton director of licensing for Core BTS tells CRN in an interview. ‘And we‘re more than happy to risk losing our customers to our competitors to have that benefit.’

Microsoft launched a 16.7 percent discount valid until June 30 for customers new to Microsoft 365 and existing customers who want to upgrade to a more premium product – a help to some partners still dealing with the rollout of the “new commerce experience” platform while still leaving in place some issues partners have with NCE.

The discount – aimed at small and midsize customers and called the “Microsoft 365 SMB and New Customer Upsell Promotion for Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) Customers” – is for customers who buy “a low-risk monthly commitment” for a variety of Microsoft 365 plans Microsoft Teams Essentials and Microsoft Defender for Business according to an announcement by the Redmond Wash.-based tech giant.

The valid M365 plans are Business Basic Business Standard Business Premium and Apps for Business. The discount does not work on “legacy” subscriptions – ones made off NCE.

Did Microsoft Change NCE?

CRN has reached out to Microsoft for comment. The company announced the promotion on Sept. 1.

In a document explaining the 16.7 percent discount Microsoft said it created the discount “to enable partners to pitch how Microsoft 365 can help prospective and existing customers ‘Do More with Less’ by consolidating vendors or improving their security and productivity posture with a more premium product.”

For new customers to M365 “This promotion creates immediate cost savings both in product value and price point for new customers while allowing customers and partners to retain the flexibility of a monthly commitment” according to Microsoft.

For customers interested in upgrading to a higher subscription type “This promotion is a fantastic opportunity for partners to explore with their existing customers how upgrading to products like Microsoft 365 Business Premium – or expanding their Microsoft 365 investment with standalone products like Microsoft Defender for Business – can save existing customers money through vendor consolidation while providing necessary productivity and security value” according to Microsoft.

Lane Shelton director of licensing for Core BTS – an Indianapolis-based Microsoft partner and member of CRN’s 2022 Solution Provider 500 – told CRN in an interview that the promotion helps his business because he upgrades a lot of customers to the Business Premium subscription.

At the beginning of the NCE roll out Core BTS used the conversations with customers to try to upsell them on Microsoft products.

“We‘ve had a lot of customers transition up which I don’t think they would have done if NCE didn’t force them to talk to us” Shelton said. “Especially back in the early days when they had the discounts on the annual SKUs (stock-keeping units) we’d be like ‘Hey you have got to talk to us in the next 30 days because maybe we can save you some money.’”

He continued: “Every customer would talk to us. And then they ended up upgrading. And so it was great because they got extra discounts. They got to upgrade. We got more revenue. The customer was happy. So there was a lot of that stuff. We would like for that to continue.”

But Microsoft still has not fixed one of the main issues with NCE – when customers buy an annual commitment customers are unable to change managed service providers until the contract ends which can result in partners taking on a customer and forgoing revenue until the end of the contract with the original MSP.

“We just would like for Microsoft to give us portability for customers” Shelton said. “And we’re more than happy to risk losing our customers to our competitors to have that benefit. Because we just think that that’s the biggest gap that they have right now. … (Dropping the 20 percent monthly premium) would mean that we could still do monthly SKUs with the vast majority of our customers.”

The 20 percent premium on month-to-month commitments also punishes customers with seasonal businesses that like to change license counts month to month Microsoft partners have told CRN.

And if customers buy annual commitments to M365 packages partners may be on the hook paying out the rest of the contract should the customer go out of business or need fewer licenses.

In July Microsoft rescinded a policy that encouraged partners to move legacy subscriptions under its Cloud Solution Provider program to NCE by January – providing an indefinite delay to when partners need to move existing subscriptions to NCE.

However partners selling new subscriptions for M365 packages have to sell them through NCE – and thus with the 20 percent premium for monthly commitments – unless the customer is upgrading to a higher subscription type or is new to M365. Then they get the 16.7 percent discount.

More On The Discount

The discount ends for customers on the first monthly anniversary date after June 30 according to Microsoft. The discount ends automatically.

Or “[p]artners can work with their customers to transition to a standard NCE annual commitment from the monthly commitment promotional offer” according to Microsoft. “This can be done at any time during the promotional period. Cancellations and adjusting automatic renewal can be scheduled in advance as well.”

Microsoft continued: “Partners should decide with their customers whether an annual or monthly commitment makes most sense based on customer need and credit risk.”

Microsoft encourages partners to lead upselling conversations with the tech giant’s security offerings according to the document explaining the discount. Partners can also use the uncertain economy as a talking point because “pressures from the evolving global economy are requiring organizations to reduce costs and optimize operations as they continue to shift to a world of hybrid work.”

Features in Partner Center can help partners determine if customers are eligible for the promotion. Customers with annual commitments cannot change existing subscriptions to monthly. Customers can cancel monthly subscriptions during the first 168 hours after renewal for a pro-rated refund according to Microsoft.

NCE isn’t the only major change Microsoft has announced for partners in 2022. In August the company unveiled changes around virtual core licensing and outsourcing certain licenses on Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services data centers.

Next month Microsoft officially launches its partner capability scores and new partner program designations that replace the long-time gold and silver system.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNkeGNlbnRyYWwuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL25ld3MvZ2FydG5lci1uYW1lcy1ha2FtYWktY2xvdWRmbGFyZS1pbXBlcnZhLWNsb3VkLXdhYXAtbGVhZGVycy8yMDIyLzA5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gartner Names Akamai Cloudflare Imperva Cloud WAAP Leaders,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/gartner-names-akamai-cloudflare-imperva-cloud-waap-leaders/2022/09/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNkeGNlbnRyYWwuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL25ld3MvZ2FydG5lci1uYW1lcy1ha2FtYWktY2xvdWRmbGFyZS1pbXBlcnZhLWNsb3VkLXdhYXAtbGVhZGVycy8yMDIyLzA5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL21hbGF5YS5jb20ucGgvbmV3c19zcGVjaWFsX2ZlYXR1cmUvZ292ZXJubWVudC1wcml2YXRlLXNlY3Rvci1jb21taXQtdG8tcGFydG5lci1mb3ItdHJ1dGgtaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi1hbmQtcHJvZ3Jlc3MtYXQtcHItY29uL9IBgwFodHRwczovL21hbGF5YS5jb20ucGgvbmV3c19zcGVjaWFsX2ZlYXR1cmUvZ292ZXJubWVudC1wcml2YXRlLXNlY3Rvci1jb21taXQtdG8tcGFydG5lci1mb3ItdHJ1dGgtaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi1hbmQtcHJvZ3Jlc3MtYXQtcHItY29uLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Government private sector commit to partner for truth innovation and progress at PR Con,"Leading public and private sector leaders have actively pledged to anchor their respective communication efforts on truth innovation and progress amid a reopening economy at the successfully concluded “The Tipping Point” the 2022 National Public Relations Congress last September 1 and 2 at The Peninsula Manila Makati City.

“Our biggest challenge today is how to turn negative communication into positive communication. Stories that are inspiring programs and campaigns that are uplifting – these are what we need today. Fellow communicators we can be the light when things get dark. We are integral to this tipping point” urged Harold C. Geronimo APR President of the Public Relations Society of the Philippines (PRSP) speaking to nearly 300 on-site delegates and over 1000 student delegates who joined online.

Organized by the PRSP the PR Congress is the largest congregation of PR practitioners across industries in the public sector civil society and students in the Philippines.

Recognizing the vital role the public and private sectors both play in communication Press Secretary Trixie Cruz-Angeles delivered the keynote message on behalf of President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. while National Economic and Development Authority Secretary Arsenio M. Balisacan shared his thoughts on how communication drives public-private partnerships in the quest for a higher growth path in the new normal.

“The government is serious about fostering a renewed sense of unity in our society. Thus it launched the One Messaging Policy which aims to prevent disinformation misinformation and malformation through close collaboration among agencies under the executive branch” Press Secretary Cruz-Angeles said.

Meanwhile homegrown business icons who joined the event’s high-level discussions include Manuel V. Pangilinan Chairman and President Metro Pacific Investments Corp. (MPIC); Kevin Tan Chief Executive Officer Alliance Global Group; June Chaye Cabal-Revilla Chief Financial Officer and Chief Sustainability Officer MPIC; and Christian Gonzalez Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer International Container Terminal Services Inc.

“We all have to work together to fight disinformation. In this profession we all have to communicate with integrity and a sense of responsibility” Tan said as part of the Positive Communications in the ‘New Normal’ panel one of the many engaging sessions during the National PR Congress.

Overseas speakers who joined the much-anticipated event were Prita Kamal Gani President ASEAN PR Network; Jaffri Amin Osman Executive Member of the Global Alliance for PR and Communication Management; Fiona Cassidy President PR Institute of New Zealand and Boy Kelana Soebroto General Chair PERHUMAS (Indonesia PR Association).

“As PR and communications professionals it is imperative ethics underpin how we operate. Our challenge is to be nimble and adapt to our environment not get distracted by the newest fad and be relevant” Cassidy remarked.

""From escalating public health and climate crises to deepening social division and geopolitical conflict the last few years have shown us how critical our focus on ESG is as our society and business continue to navigate complex global challenges"" said Crystal Barnes SVP of Corporate Social Responsibility and ESG at Paramount. ""Our actions at Paramount help shape culture and conversation with real-world impacts—and we are more committed than ever to our duty and opportunity to deliver responsible informative and culturally powerful content that can help shape a more sustainable and inclusive world.""

In addition to updated workforce and environmental impact data this year's report gives a more detailed overview of the company's ESG governance practices including Paramount's ESG Council governance structure. Additionally as the company continues to focus on advancing diversity and inclusion in front and behind the camera it includes an update on its overarching efforts to advance this work through the company's global cross-brand initiative Content for Change.

Other notable aspects of the report include:

Diverse and Inclusive Stories and Storytellers: Over the years Paramount and its brands have led the way in telling and amplifying the stories of underrepresented audiences. Most recently that commitment has been exemplified by CBS-NAACP Ventures—a partnership first announced in 2020—which sold its first five projects in January of 2022 including a reboot of the ­­Nine  and a new film about the pathbreaking building magnate Cheryl McKissack . Additionally on-screen content and social impact goals have been set for a number of Paramount brands for 2022 and many have already demonstrated great progress including Showtime Networks which in 2022 had 60% of its scripted series with BIPOC leads or co-leads as well as 56% of its projects in development from BIPOC creators; CBS Television Network surpassed its goal with 43 % BIPOC representation in writers' rooms in 2021-2022; and starting in 2022 Paramount's International Studios dedicated 25% of its development budget across its international footprint to stories focused on or related to underrepresented groups and issues.

Corporate Governance and Workforce: Corporate governance is crucial to the success of Paramount's business and with a Board of Directors comprised of seven women out of 12 members (one of the highest percentages among S&P 500 companies) Paramount is committed to continuing to be a leader in this space. Notably in 2021 Paramount's internal promotion rate for women at the SVP level reached 56% and its external hire rate for women at the SVP level and above reached 53% globally. Additionally in the U.S. the internal promotion rate for ethnically diverse VPs was 30% and the external hire rate for ethnically diverse VPs and above was 51%.

Sustainable Production and Operations: Paramount continues to work to limit the environmental and social impacts associated with its business operations. For example 15.4% of its global electricity consumption is renewable up from 13.6% in 2020. Paramount also supports a centralized food recovery program to help route extra meals from productions and events to local food banks. Reducing and diverting waste generated by Paramount productions and events not only saves resources but reduces GHG emissions associated with the production and disposal of materials. In 2021 51% of waste from Paramount Television Studios and Motion Picture Group productions was diverted from landfill; for example the Long Slow Exhale production diverted 134 tons of waste from the landfill by recycling and using rented or reused set materials wherever possible.

The ESG report is guided by external ESG frameworks in alignment with ESG and sustainability best practices including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). It also outlines the company's alignment with relevant United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) including Gender Equality Decent Work and Economic Growth and Climate Action.

Want to know why this year’s biggest theatrical movie -- Paramount’s “Top Gun Maverick” -- still hasn’t made a debut on the Paramount+ streaming service?

This headline should give you some insight: 'Top Gun: Maverick' Becomes the No. 1 Digital Sell-Through Title Ever.' This comes on top of its seemingly nonstop theatrical business.

When asked about the movie’s release on Paramount+ during an investor conference on Wednesday Brian Robbins president and CEO of Paramount Pictures said “later this year.”

Hmm.. it’s almost mid-September already. To me this means perhaps Paramount executives could be saying this behind closed doors: “Getting it on Paramount+? After we ring every digital purchase/theatrical ticket dollar out of this puppy.”

advertisement advertisement

Earlier this week Digital Entertainment Group said “Maverick” passed Universal’s “Jurassic World Dominion'' as the number-one movie when it comes to direct “sell-through” purchase. The price is $19.99. But Digital Entertainment Group didn’t offer many specific details.

How many customers? The studio isn’t saying. Paramount Global sell-though activities started up before Labor Day -- on August 23. Labor Day weekend can be a particularly slow period for theatrical marketers. So that seems like a good move.

At the same time “Top Gun” -- now in its 15th week of theatrical release -- posted a weekend-leading $7.9 million. And remember this came amidst a number of movie theater chains banded together this year to offer a much lower price $3 per ticket promotion under a special National Cinema Day event.

In addition it has climbed to the fifth-best-performing domestic movie ever globally ($701 million) and $1.44 billion globally according to Comscore.

Old-school theatrical release thinking has found its way back with major movie/TV studio executives:

While trying to grow their new streamer businesses they are protecting their best monetization efforts for their best movie and TV content brands. And that means getting cash to the bottom line -- especially in theaters as well as with direct-to-consumer transaction sales.

Previously analysts believed many theatrically intended movies could provide streamers big tools to build business. Studios like WarnerMedia went overboard putting an entire yearly slate of movies on HBO Max at the same time as their theatrical releases.

Now with skyrocketing TV and movie production and acquisition streaming costs -- as well as increased competition -- media companies re-emphasizing the bottom line that revenue big branded movies can offer.

Lastly -- although there is no mention so far -- you can be assured the enduring “Top Gun” franchise will almost certainly find another film version coming in the near term.

And maybe just maybe by then “Top Gun” movies will find some faster jets to the home entertainment consumers on Paramount+.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vdHZsaW5lLmNvbS9jYXN0aW5nLW5ld3MvY3JpbWluYWwtbWluZHMtZXZvbHV0aW9uLXJlYm9vdC1yZWxlYXNlLWRhdGUtcGFyYW1vdW50LXBsdXMtMTIzNDg2OTYzMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Criminal Minds: Evolution' Reboot Release Date on Paramount Plus,"Criminal Minds is getting a titular makeover — and a new villain — ahead of its return this fall.

Paramount+ on Friday announced that the official title of the 10-episode quasi-16th season will be Criminal Minds: Evolution.

Additionally Friday Night Lights vet Zach Gilford is joining the cast as the recurring season-long baddie Elias Voit an operations analyst for a global cyber-security firm who has a dark side and obsession with death. The character was previously billed as the BAU’s “greatest threat yet — an UnSub who has used the pandemic to build a network of other serial killers.” As the world opens up post-COVID “the team must hunt them down one murder at a time.”

The team in question includes veteran cast members Joe Mantegna (David) A.J. Cook (JJ) Kirsten Vangsness (Penelope) Aisha Tyler (Tara) Adam Rodriguez (Luke) and Paget Brewster (Emily). As previously reported Matthew Gray Gubler and Daniel Henney will not be reprising their roles as Spencer and Matt respectively.

Gilford’s post-FNL TV credits include L.A.’s Finest Good Girls and most recently Midnight Mass.

In officially confirming Criminal Minds‘ comeback back in July Paramount+ president Nicole Clemens said in a statement “For 15 seasons Criminal Minds was at the forefront of cutting-edge scripted drama as it explored the psychology behind crime — thrillingly. The series never stopped evolving during its run and we are beyond excited to bring it back into a new era with new stories for a new generation of viewers at Paramount+. Erica the whole cast and creative team are building a season full of new twists that we are sure will electrify audiences.”

Longtime Criminal Minds showrunner/EP Erica Messer will be back to oversee the revival with Breen Frazier and Chris Barbour returning as writers/executive producers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJldC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS95M2dnemYvbGF0dG8tanQtZ2xvcmlsbGEtZm5mLXJlbWl40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Latto And JT Link With GloRilla For 'FNF (Let's Go)' Remix,By clicking Subscribe you confirm that you have read and agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy Policy .

Want an exciting summer internship? Looking for employment after graduation? Then make plans to attend Mizzou Engineering’s Fall 2022 Career Fair from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Thursday Sept. 22 at MizzouRec.

“Even if you’re not sure what you want to do this is a great opportunity to explore internship and post-graduation options” said Anh Nguyen career services coordinator. “Hiring managers from some of the top companies and engineering firms in the country are coming to campus because they want to meet with students and hear about their interests and professional aspirations. This is really a chance to network with leaders in the field.”

More than 220 employers are attending this year’s Career Fair including representatives from industries such as Burns & McDonnell ARCO Garmin Emerson and Tradebot and governmental agencies such as the Missouri Department of Transportation and U.S. Armed Forces.

“These companies are very interested in hiring Mizzou Engineers because they know our students have had or are going to have incredible leadership and research experiences and are getting a top-notch engineering education that teaches both foundational skills and technical know-how” Nguyen said. “CEOs and hiring managers often tell us they’re looking for well-rounded individuals who have had experiences both within and outside of engineering. They know Mizzou graduates will exceed their expectations.”

While Mizzou Engineering’s is the largest career fair on campus it’s not the only one engineering students can attend. The Trulaske College of Business College of Agriculture Food and Natural Resources School of Health Professions and other colleges and schools on campus also host career fairs that allow engineering students to explore internship and employment opportunities in related fields.

“That really gives Mizzou Engineering students an advantage as it exposes them to a wide array of career options” said Emily Bozich corporate relations and professional development specialist. “It’s just one of the benefits of being on a campus that has so many different disciplines most of which have some connection to engineering.”

Frasers which owns a host of high street brands including Sports Direct and House of Fraser is poised to rejoin the index on Tuesday taking up the slot vacated by Meggitt which has been bought by a US defence rival Parker Hannifin.

Frasers which at the time traded as Sports Direct fell out of the blue chip index in 2016 after its share price slumped on the back of a Guardian investigation that revealed poor pay and working conditions at the company as well as poor trading in its stores.

A lot has changed in the intervening years as Ashley who is worth about $4.7bn (£4bn) according to the Bloomberg billionaires index sought to diversify the group from its discount clothing roots. It acquired the House of Fraser department store chain in 2018 and has been investing heavily in the luxury Flannels chain.

Although Ashley remains the business’s controlling shareholder with an almost 70% stake he is no longer its public face having installed his son-in-law Michael Murray as chief executive earlier this year. One former worker previously described Murray as “a more acceptable version of Mike Ashley”.

Frasers has been a bright spot among UK retail stocks this year as investors expect surging inflation will force shoppers to cut back while at the same time squeezing company profit margins. This week both Primark’s owner Associated British Foods and Asos reported challenging market conditions.

However Frasers’ share price is up 20% in the past year to about 810p with the company reporting in the summer that sales and profits had rebounded strongly from the disruption caused by the pandemic. Analysts say the company is benefiting from a cooling of competition in sports retail as well as the closure of House of Fraser’s weakest stores.

While this website can help you save on groceries it won’t make money magically appear in your bank account. However some lucky people have been fortunate enough to be blessed with $500 from a stranger.

It turns out that it was by mistake and the sender now wants the money returned. Before you send the money back there is one critical thing you must know.

Read on to learn about a clever new scam making the rounds and what you need to outsmart it.

Here’s the backstory

Sending digital payments to friends and family is made easy by tools like Venmo Zelle and Apple Pay. When you meet a friend for dinner one person can pay the check and the other can send them their part through one of these digital wallets.

If you do use a digital payment tool be careful. The Better Business Bureau (BBB) says you must be aware of a clever twist to an old scam. Here’s what’s happening.

Strangers are randomly sending people money through apps like Venmo. Once you receive money through the app you’ll get a message from the sender apologizing and saying it was sent by mistake. They then ask you to send the money back.

But here’s where the scam comes into play. The thief sent you payment through a digital wallet using a stolen credit card. They then remove the stolen card and replace it with an account they own. Once you send payment back to them the money goes into their account not the one they stole.

Here’s where the scheme gets super sneaky. When the accidental charge is taken from the stolen card the legitimate owner will contact their bank and have it reversed. When their bank reverses the charges you’re out of luck. The funds will be taken back from your digital wallet on top of the payment you sent.

Now you’re out of luck and money.

How to protect against digital wallet scams

Do not send the money back if this scenario ever happens to you. Instead tell the person who sent the money to ask the vendor to cancel the transaction. No matter how much they beg don’t give in. You’re not obligated to correct their mistake.

The BBB says “Be aware that unlike credit cards many digital wallet vendors will not shoulder the cost of fraud. If you pay scammers using a digital wallet you may not ever get reimbursed.”

Here are more suggestions from the BBB to protect against digital wallet scams:

Use money transfer apps with family and friends – Protect yourself from scams by only using money transfer apps for their intended purpose. Sending money to people you know.

– Protect yourself from scams by only using money transfer apps for their intended purpose. Sending money to people you know. Put the burden on the sender – Ask them to cancel the transaction if someone sends you money by mistake. The sender can request that the vendor cancel the transaction. If the person refuses it’s probably a scam.

– Ask them to cancel the transaction if someone sends you money by mistake. The sender can request that the vendor cancel the transaction. If the person refuses it’s probably a scam. Enable additional security settings – Check your account settings to see if you can turn on other security measures such as multi-factor authentication requiring a PIN or using fingerprint recognition.

– Check your account settings to see if you can turn on other security measures such as multi-factor authentication requiring a PIN or using fingerprint recognition. Link your money transfer app to a credit card – As with many other purchases using a credit card will help protect you if you don’t get the goods or services you paid for. Linking to a debit card or your bank account does not give you that added protection.

A tweak to an operational process seems insignificant compared to production line shutdowns and lack of vital components.

But according to Les Cyfko Director M&W Operations Engineering and Continuous Improvement at PepsiCo the pandemic has exposed the direct correlation between continuous improvement and overall company performance and results.

“Lean Six Sigma by virtue of simple tools like process mapping identifying pain points and non-value added activities can help you discover potential solutions” he explains. “That is of paramount importance to being able to unlock some of the issues that have appeared in the macroeconomic climate as well as mitigating some of the potential future risks that might come our way.”

In this interview Cyfko who was instrumental in setting up Pepsi’s Lean Six Sigma program a decade ago discusses the impact of the past few years reflects on a decade of Lean Six Sigma at Pepsi and reveals why he’ll be focusing on reigniting the Lean Six Sigma program at the global beverage maker in the year ahead.

Diana Davis IX Network: What does your operational excellence program look like at Pepsi?

Les Cyfko Pespi Co: The continuous improvement program at Pepsi is really based on two planks. The first is lean Six Sigma which is end-to-end across the business.

With our Lean Six Sigma program we’re looking to reduce the seven forms of waste which we call TIMWOOD. That stands for Transportation Inventory Motion Waiting Overproduction Overprocessing and Defects.

These wastes are the target of Lean; we generally apply Six Sigma to Design of Experiments such as finding the right center lining or to more complex business supply chain related business problems.

The second plan for our continuous improvement program is TPM – Total Productive Maintenance. This is geared for our plants and manufacturing facilities to reduce downtime increase uptime and ensure the long-term viability of our equipment.

Much of our equipment costs millions to replace; it’s also very disruptive if we have to take an asset offline. If we can extend the lifetime of our machines and assets that helps ensure an uninterrupted supply chain.

Diana Davis IX Network: How are you structured? Do you have a centralized team that runs the operational excellence program or is it embedded within the business units themselves?

Les Cyfko Pepsi Co: There’s not a simple answer to that. We have a sector team which is run out of New York. The team oversees our Lean Six Sigma and Total Productive Maintenance programs across Pepsi Beverages North America.

That said it’s a very loose management. We are driven by the philosophy “nationally great locally even better.”

Within Canada we’re free to explore bigger better faster stronger ways to apply Lean Six Sigma and TPM to find out what works best for our division locally.

Diana Davis IX Network: What role do you see a continuous improvement mindset and traditional process improvement tools like lean and Six Sigma playing to help companies respond to the disruption we’ve seen in the past few years?

Les Cyfko Pepsi Co: I think they’ve played a very important role.

First we had a pandemic which gave employees an opportunity to work remotely and in many cases to rethink their life. As a result people have been examining their relationship with work which has resulted in what some are calling the “great resignation” which has impacted all businesses. Effectively we’re seeing different manifestations of change in people’s habits and how they think of their life.

The second disruption is inflation. Without a doubt commodities are increasing in price rapidly. It’s an unprecedented pace of inflation.

The third disruption is that global tensions have increased to a level that we haven’t seen in decades. The war in Ukraine has divided up what was a global economy into something potentially different where we may see separate economies emerging in different geopolitical regions.

These disruptions hit home to PepsiCo because we have hundreds of thousands of employees. We’ve felt the impact across the board of employees changing their careers and perspectives on what they want to do with their future. Turnover has increased as a result.

One of the first principles of a continuous improvement is standardization but it’s difficult to standardize when your team is changing players continuously. Lean Six Sigma and TPM play a vital role in maintaining standardization in a particularly volatile environment such as this.

Then let’s turn to inflation. For many companies Lean Six Sigma and TPM are applied to offset inflationary pressures. If inflation is increasing at two or three percent per year normally companies look to harvest a 3-5% annual productivity improvement.

This is the case in the automotive industry for instance. Often it’s written into contracts that price will reduce – or at least not increase – within the automotive supply chain. Your margins are only developed through continuous improvement by lowering your costs to offset the inflationary pressures.

But because inflation so high now – it’s well beyond 5% – how else does one get the productivity that’s required to maintain margins? That’s where continuous improvement comes in and it’s becoming much more important through that lens.

Finally global tensions have made a significant impact on the supply chain. Pepsi food and beverage sources ingredients from all over the world. So even if the even if the sourcing doesn’t change the means of transportation might because certain routes may no longer be friendly or viable. That has meant that the cost of transportation and logistics has increased dramatically.

Another challenge is that there are far fewer truck drivers than is necessary for the number of truck loads required on a daily basis across North America. Even just being able to find transportation to maintain a steady supply chain is under immense threat.

Lean Six Sigma by virtue of simple tools like process mapping identifying pain points and non value added activities can help you know what potential solutions there might be. That is of paramount importance to being able to unlock some of the issues that have appeared in the macroeconomic climate as well as mitigating some of the potential future risks that might come our way.

Diana Davis IX Network: It sounds like Lean and Six Sigma are good problem solving tools. They give you a way of thinking and approaching problems?

Les Cyfko PepsiCo: Sometimes people try to rethink Six Sigma and rethink TPM. Many companies relabel these process improvement methodologies with different names or use the latest buzzwords when it comes to process improvement.

But the fact remains these methods are like the scientific method. The method was valid 50 years ago when insulin was discovered and the same methodologies apply today as we’re trying to find the cure for cancer.

At the end of the day these methodologies are tried and true. I think we should spend less time trying to invent new names for these processes and stick to the tools that work and have been tested over time.

Diana Davis IX Network: It’s been a decade since you started building PepsiCo’s Lean Six Sigma program. How has the way that you approach process improvement changed since you started back in 2012?

Les Cykfo PepsiCo: When I started in 2012 there was a lack of lack of skill but there was interest. People were curious and there was a desire for something that could unlock a lot of productivity.

At the time Pepsi had just acquired a bottling group. All the bottlers had essentially been independent up to that point. The company was looking to achieve many hundreds of thousands of dollars of savings across North America.

We needed Lean Six Sigma to achieve this. But we had very little skill on how to use these tools. My main focus at that point was training everybody from the top down. We ensured that leadership understood how to pick the projects what Six Sigma could do and what it couldn’t how to get the right project scope and how to be a good sponsor.

We also trained for depth in the organization to be able to lead Lean Six Sigma projects in parallel to rolling out TPM in the plants. We set up the proper steering teams in the facilities and coached the plants on the pillars of TPM best practices and how to prioritize.

Fast forward to today where we have a lot of skill but the will isn’t as great. I think the reason for this is two-fold.

First because of the current macroeconomic pressures and the disruption in our supply chain and on our business people are focused on these challenges. There’s definitely a sense of competing priorities.

The second is that there is a complacency that has settled into the organization. We’ve done all the heavy lifting of building our Lean Six Sigma and TPM programs. We have a lot of people trained.

I think it’s quite common at this stage to have an autopilot that sets in. People believe that Six Sigma will continue to roll on its momentum.

But that certainly isn’t the case.

For example from a project management perspective it’s common for groups to take their foot off the pedal when they pass phase one. I see that as well with Lean Six Sigma. It’s hard to get some groups energized because they always looking for something new.

Once Lean Six Sigma is no longer headline news it becomes harder to sell the newspapers so to speak. People are always looking for something new to make themselves or their teams look like they’re doing something innovative.

Diana Davis IX Network: What have been your big learnings to deal with that challenge?

Les Cyfko PepsiCo: I should add that part of the challenge has been the pandemic. I haven’t been able to be too hands on; through the pandemic things were allowed to slide a bit as we focused on running the business in a challenging environment.

But we’ve found that there is a correlation between the lack of intensity of applying continuous improvement and overall performance and results. That makes it easier for me to point to the correlation and make that point that without a focus on Six Sigma and TPM our lines are not performing as they should and our throughput is diminished.

By pointing out these correlations it makes it easier to reignite the field – our system our people and our teams – around Lean Six Sigma and TPM it’s a bit like a new beginning.

Diana Davis IX Network: We spoke a little bit about all the new names and rebranding that process improvement tends to go by. The word ‘transformation’ is bandied about a lot now. Do you think there’s something new going on or is this just a new way of packaging something companies have always done?

Les Cyfko PepsiCo: I think that’s a very interesting question. I’m not going to pretend I have all the answers but from my experience I would say that without a doubt there is a dynamic tension between the rote continuous improvement tools and digital technology.

The continuous improvement tools are very basic tools that have stood the test of time and I think will always stand on their own merits. But as those tools are applied to a more transformational perspective you introduce digital technology.

Both require data. We have the means to acquire data like never before. Data can give you a competitive advantage if you have good data and you know how to use that data.

So I think there’s a dynamic tension between the principles of continuous improvement and the advances that technology enables.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning for instance helps in the plants by machines talking to each other in real time. That allows the machines to automatically adjust speeds balance the lines based on certain situations in order to maximize throughput and free up people’s time to be able to do more continuous improvement.

If you look at back-office work like accounting a lot of artificial intelligence bots now do a lot of the data entry and processing work that otherwise would have taken a lot more time. I think that frees up people to do more of the value added continuous improvement work. So I think they play off each other.

Diana Davis IX Network: What’s your focus at Pepsi in the year ahead?

Les Cyfko PepsiCo: It’s back to basics for us. Over the pandemic we were essentially scrambling just to keep the business going. Now with turnover being what it is I think we’ve lost a lot of sense of how to run the basic processes that have that have been honed over years.

We’re ramping up training across the board. That’s the biggest focus today. We are also rebooting and renewing our Lean Six Sigma and TPM efforts to counteract the malaise that has set in over the last few years.

Diana Davis IX Network: Finally what are you hoping to get out of our Operational Excellence Canada event?

Les Cyfko PepsiCo: I always get a lot out of your events. I go in with a sense of what I’m looking to get out of it but I also try to keep an open mind so that I can absorb the vast array of information. I think it’s important to balance between having expectations and just soaking in all the learning and experience.

There hasn’t been one single OpEx event that that you’ve delivered that has not resulted in an immense amount of learning for me. I refer back to the notes I take at the events periodically. There are some great learnings that I have been able to apply in my work and in the business.

In short I’m looking for more thought-provoking golden nuggets of information based on interactions with others and the many great speakers that you have at these events.

By 2019 he'd closed a licensing and bottling deal with PepsiCo. Courtesy of Exotic Pop

Exotic Pop – a 'unique beverage boutique' – was founded in 2016 by Charleston Wilson.

The company reached a licensing and bottling agreement with PepsiCo in 2019.

In 2021 Exotic Pop reported $6 million in profits after years of support from hip-hop icons.

Exotic Pop a company selling hard-to-get sodas and limited-edition snacks that has earned millions and thrives on celebrities' cravings started with a casual 2016 road trip to Louisiana.

Described as a ""unique beverage boutique"" online Charleston Wilson's brainchild was sparked by a weekend drive to Baton Rouge where he spent about $100 on sodas to bring back home to Houston. After purchasing the limited-edition soda flavors as a favor to a friend Wilson started selling some of them out of the trunk of his car Mel Magazine reports.

Years later the now-multimillion dollar snack distribution company also is known for its access to exotic cereals — like Wild Berry Froot Loops Serena Williams Wheaties and Oreo O's — and manufactures its own soda flavors after successfully closing a deal with PepsiCo for licensing and bottling in 2019.

In 2021 Exotic Pop raked in $6 million in profits.

Wilson is known his array of celebrity clients. He's Drake's go-to in Houston for Clearly Canadian sparkling water and Lil Wayne has his favorite sodas delivered weekly from Exotic Pop the Houston Chronicle reported in May.

Atlanta rapper Offset appears to be a big fan of Exotic Pop. His wife Cardi B took to Instagram to show off the rapper's collection of over 15 exotic cereal boxes.

Wilson's business grew after he moved his products from his trunk to custom vending machines in 2016; each machine was dedicated to a different Houston rap legend – including the late DJ Screw and Pimp C.







""I put (a picture of DJ Screw's) first (record store) location on the front of the machine and his mixtapes on the side and I made it a work of art to go with the mystique of the sodas"" he said to Mel. ""It had this whole nostalgia-DJ Screw vibe going on.""

The first machines carrying Wilson's rare – and pricey – soda flavors were in grocery stores around Houston. Then Exotic Pop took off on social media.

Houston rapper Paul Wall shared a photo of Wilson's booth at a Houston car show to Instagram in 2018 and soon Exotic Pop was in demand by smoke shops and convenience stores nationwide according to the report from Mel.

""At first it was a slow start. People didn't want to pay $3-$6 for a 99-cent soda"" Wilson told The Hustle. ""But as soon as it became a status (symbol) and was bounced off these major influencers it was an American love story.""

A vending machine collaboration with Travis Scott went viral in 2019. It featured hologram effects a 40-inch LED screen and of course Exotic Pop drinks.

Wilson has no plans of slowing down. After releasing a variety of beverages tied to hip-hop icons Exotic Pop is continuing to aim high. The company plans to collaborate with Lil Wayne Snoop Dogg and Rob Kardashian the Chronicle reports.

""This became a whole other bragging right for hip-hop culture"" Exotic Pop president Kehlin Farooq told the Chronicle.

""There's an association of a lifestyle that goes along with drinking a soda pop. We added the music the art the culture.

The quirky TVC showcases Pepsi’s and Airtel’s latest data offering on its PET bottles where consumers can avail Airtel recharge benefits worth INR 10 to INR 20. With the launch of this new TVC Pepsi aims to bring a streak of celebration with its distinct value-for-money offering through its collaboration with Airtel.

The light humoured TVC opens at a basketball practice where a girl cheekily says hello to a boy. The boy is convinced that the girl loves him because she had asked him to recharge her talk time. However his friend who is sitting beside him cheekily asks – if she truly loves you then who is she talking to and spending the talk time on? The question gives the boy a reality check however his friend hands him a chilled bottle of Pepsi to calm him down. Seeing the Airtel recharge discount offer on the Pepsi bottle leaves the boy puzzled to which his friend smartly responds that the next time you recharge her phone it will hurt you less as you can use redeemable discount coupons that come with every Pepsi bottle. Both look at each other smile and take another sip of the Pepsi with SWAG.

This was followed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ recommendation for use of the Pfizer bivalent booster vaccine for ages 12 years and older and the Moderna bivalent vaccine for ages 18 years and older.

“This is great news as we go into the fall and winter when we expect cases of COVID-19 to increase” said Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) chief medical executive. “The bivalent booster will help fight the Omicron subvariants including BA.4 and 5. COVID-19 vaccines remain our best defense against the virus and we recommend all Michiganders stay up to date.”

The Moderna and Pfizer bivalent boosters target two strains of COVID-19 – the original strain of the virus and the most widely-spread Omicron variants (BA.4 and BA.5). Individuals ages 12 years and older who have completed any FDA-approved or FDA-authorized monovalent primary series (Pfizer Moderna Novavax or Johnson & Johnson) or previously received monovalent booster doses are eligible to receive one bivalent (Pfizer or Moderna) COVID-19 booster.

Michiganders can begin getting the bivalent vaccines as they become available. MDHHS has worked with vaccine providers across the state to ensure they were prepared for the arrival of the bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccines. Older formulations of booster doses will no longer be available to persons 12 and older as the FDA has removed authorization for those boosters.

To locate providers offering the Pfizer and Moderna bivalent booster doses check your local pharmacy or visit vaccines.gov which will be updated with bivalent booster locations soon.

Who is eligible to receive a single bivalent booster dose and when:

Individuals 18 years of age and older are eligible for a single booster dose of the bivalent Moderna COVID-19 vaccine if it has been at least two months since they completed primary vaccination or received the most recent booster dose with any authorized or approved monovalent COVID-19 vaccine.

Individuals 12 years of age and older are eligible for a single booster dose of the bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine if it has been at least two months since they completed primary vaccination or received the most recent booster dose with any authorized or approved monovalent COVID-19 vaccine.

Individuals may choose to receive either the Pfizer or Moderna bivalent booster regardless of which primary series vaccine or original booster dose they had previously. Influenza vaccines which are now available in Michigan can also be co-administered with the COVID-19 bivalent booster doses.

To date nearly 6.8 million Michiganders ages 5 and up have gotten at least their first dose of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. Eligible Michiganders are encouraged to stay up to date on vaccinations which includes booster doses that provide extra protection and residents of long-term care facilities where outbreaks can spread quickly and extra protection is strongly recommended.

MDHHS also encourages Michigan residents to pay attention to local guidance as some communities may be at a higher risk of COVID-19 transmission.

To schedule a primary or booster dose of the COVID vaccine visit vaccines.gov.

Governor Kathy Hochul

New reformulated COVID-19 booster shots are out from Pfizer and Moderna.

They're designed to combat Omicron but also include an ""ancestral"" virus component.

As long as it's been at least 2 months since your last COVID-19 vaccine it's fine to line up and get one.

The very first updated COVID-19 vaccines are here.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) signed off on two new vaccines last week — one from Pfizer one from Moderna. For now Pfizer's is for everyone 12 years old and up while Moderna's is only for adults over 18.

Both new vaccines are designed to fight against the BA.4 and BA.5 versions of Omicron which are what is currently circulating across the US.

Here is what you need to know about them.

These may be the last free COVID-19 vaccines you'll get

This fall booster campaign is likely the last chance you'll get to have free COVID-19 shots from the US government.

Reuters reported last week that the Department of Health and Human Services is planning to ""transition procurement and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics from a federally managed system to the commercial marketplace"" in 2023.

The shots are 'bivalent' meaning they target 2 versions of the virus

New York Governor's Office

Half of the mRNA product is targeted against ""ancestral"" SARS-CoV-2 meaning it's the same stuff that was in previous vaccines. The other 50% of the dose is designed to combat BA.4 and BA.5 which are the specific versions of Omicron we are dealing with right now.

Having a bivalent product means that we will have good protection if and when the virus mutates again — even if it drifts away from the currently-circulating Omicron variants.

The strategy is similar to how vaccine-makers treat influenza. This year's flu vaccine for example is quadrivalent meaning it is formulated to fight back against four distinct flu types.

Moderna's shot is still bigger than Pfizer's

The total mRNA volume of these vaccines is exactly the same size as previous booster shots:

The Pfizer shot contains 30ug while Moderna's shot contains 50ug per dose.

If you recently had COVID wait a couple months

On green-lighting these boosters the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said anyone can get one ""at least two months"" after their last COVID-19 shot.







If you had COVID this summer you can technically get your booster any time.

However health officials at the CDC say ""people who recently had SARS-CoV-2 infection may consider delaying a primary series dose or booster dose by three months.""

Epidemiologist Katelyn Jetelina recommends waiting at least two months after a COVID-19 infection the same as you would after any previous COVID-19 shot.

""We do not have to wait 3 months after infection"" Jetelina explained in a recent newsletter. ""We won't 'exhaust' or 'overwhelm' our immune system but by delaying we get the biggest bang for our vaccine buck.""

Will you need a yearly COVID booster? Experts are divided

President Biden has suggested that COVID-19 vaccines are going to become an annual tradition much like flu shots are now.

""One COVID-19 shot once a year each fall"" he said on Tuesday in a statement.

Infectious disease experts aren't so sure about that. Many are hoping that new kinds of COVID-19 vaccines being developed could be better long-term solutions than the shots we have now. Some new vaccines are being designed as nasal sprays you can inhale or patches you'd put on your skin while other ""universal"" vaccines could target multiple different coronaviruses all at once.

Symptoms include arm pain and fatigue

The four most common side effects for both bivalent boosts have included:

arm pain at the injection site fatigue headaches and myalgia (generalized muscle aches and pains) after the shot is administered.

While this side effect data was generated from vaccine trials in people who got bivalent boosters targeted to BA.1 that's a version of Omicron that ""only differs slightly"" from BA.4/5 according to Dr. Peter Marks who directs the FDA's division in charge of vaccine safety and effectiveness. Vaccine side effects are expected to be very similar if not identical with these new shots.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lZHBhZ2V0b2RheS5jb20vc3BlY2lhbC1yZXBvcnRzL2ZlYXR1cmVzLzEwMDYzM9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Health System Warns Exemptions to COVID Vaccines May Expire With New Options,"The Froedtert Health network in Wisconsin has sent a clear message to employees claiming religious exemptions from COVID-19 vaccination: with an alternative to mRNA vaccines now available get vaccinated or resign.

In an email to a Froedtert staff member obtained by WTMJ-TV the health network's COVID-19 Vaccine Religious Exemption Review Committee wrote ""Your original exemption submission and additional documentation you provided do not meet the criteria of explaining your sincerely held religious belief that conflicts with receiving the COVID-19 vaccine including the new Novavax vaccine.""

The religious exemption will not be upheld despite additional comments provided that ""related to opinions or non-factual information"" the committee added. If the staff member does not get a first dose by September 21 they will be ""considered voluntarily resigned.""

The move by Froedtert which is affiliated with the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee signals a blow to vaccine holdouts in the workplace including healthcare providers who have argued their religion prevents them from getting vaccinated.

While the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mRNA-based Novavax is protein-based. Those who requested religious exemptions to their work or school policies have often cited the use of fetal material in mRNA vaccines or in their development though neither Novavax nor the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines contain fetal tissue or DNA. However it has been reported that laboratory-replicated fetal cell lines some originating from abortions decades ago have been used in the testing of mRNA vaccines.

Dorit Reiss PhD a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco who has researched religious exemptions from vaccines told MedPage Today it was only a matter of time before some employers including hospitals started to enforce vaccination policies after Novavax was authorized for use in August.

""I've said publicly before that I think Novavax does change the situation in relation to arguments about cell lines"" she said. ""This is the first I've heard of an employer actually moving on it.""

An emailed statement from Froedtert to MedPage Today said in part ""This protein-based vaccination option eliminates conflicts for those staff with religious or medical exemptions caused by mRNA-based vaccines and other concerns. Since those staff are now eligible for a vaccination that does not conflict with their religious beliefs or medical situation their exemption will expire.""

The health network said that the rule will affect less than 1% of their staff and that ""impacted employees"" were given a chance to apply for another exemption before previous ones expired noting they will uphold ""valid medical exemptions and sincerely held religious exemptions.""

Reiss said of the many claims to back up religious exemptions she's come across the fetal cell line argument was perhaps the most common partially because it might curry favor from pro-life judges. ""If they can piggyback on the abortion debate they're more likely to win"" in a dispute she said. But other reasons like the claim that some religions require blood to be free of contamination have also been used.

Some vocal opponents of vaccine requirements may have anticipated the post-Novavax repercussions and urged their followers to use other reasons to back up their religious objections Reiss said.

For example Cait Corrigan a Boston University theology student behind a group called Students Against Mandates posted an online outline to the group's website with tips for ""successful"" religious exemption letters writing ""Note you can write about aborted fetal tissue ... but this is not enough! (You must talk about the issue of Blood in the vaccines being made in the Image of God etc.)"" (MedPage Today could not confirm whether Corrigan is still a student at Boston University.)

But neither these types of arguments nor religious beliefs are likely to hold up in most courts according to Reiss and other experts. ""The standard for vaccine mandates in the workplace is you can refuse an exemption if it's an undue burden like the burden of not having vaccinated employees at a hospital"" she said.

And though objections to vaccination itself may be sincere ""for most of them I think it's about safety concerns many of them created by misinformation"" Reiss noted. ""For most of them the religion is a cover for that concern.""

Moderna’s formula is authorized for use as a single booster dose in people 18 years and up. Pfizer’s is for people 12 years and up.

The shots — approved by the Food and Drug Administration in August and then recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Sept. 1 — are advised for almost all fully vaccinated people 12 and up as long as it has been at least two months after their last shot or COVID-19 infection. People who are immunocompromised should talk with their doctor.

This booster as with the other COVID-19 vaccines will continue to be offered free regardless of insurance status.

Sanford resident Seth Jestus 35 booked an appointment as soon as he heard the news because his fiancée has type 1 diabetes a condition that puts people at increased risk of getting severely ill from COVID-19.

“I try my best to take her health extremely seriously and will do whatever it takes to make her feel at ease and comfortable with the situation that she’s been dealt as a diabetic” Jestus said.

After getting the shot on Tuesday he said his symptoms were similar to the ones he had after getting his first three Pfizer shots: headache fever and vomiting. They cleared up after 24 hours.

Ryan Stotler who lives in a Tampa suburb also plans to boost himself and his son to protect both of them against the possibility of severe disease.

“For the last 3 months Florida has been number 1 in the nation for Covid deaths” he wrote. “Much like I’ve gotten a flu shot every year this is just another way to mitigate risk.”

Jill Roberts an associate professor at the University of South Florida College of Public Health reiterated that almost everyone over 12 who is fully vaccinated should get this shot even Floridians who have already been infected or double-boosted.

This COVID-19 shot and the annual flu shot can even be scheduled for the same time one in each arm.

“A vaccine is essentially free immunity. And I say that because it’s free from the side effects of the disease itself” Roberts said. “There’s individuals already who are trying to figure out how they can get disability and things like that for long COVID and the more we can limit that the better.”

The CDC estimates one in five Americans who catch COVID-19 have “long COVID-19” new chronic symptoms that linger for months or even years after they stop being contagious.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers a chart explaining the rules around the new “bivalent” boosters that target BA.4 and BA.5. Some age groups should still stick to the original monovalent booster.

Until now vaccines have targeted the original strain of COVID-19 even as delta then omicron emerged and became dominant said Dr. Ashish Jha White House COVID-19 Response coordinator at a Tuesday news conference.

“For the first time since December of 2020 these vaccines — our vaccines — have caught up with the virus” Jha said.

The news comes as BA.5 continues to dominate Central Florida wastewater.

On Aug. 29 the omicron BA.5 subvariant mutation was detected in about 90% of SARS-CoV-2 variant genomes shed by infected people when they go to the bathroom according to data provided by Frank Martz city manager of Altamonte Springs. The Altamonte sewer service area covers parts of Orange and Seminole counties.

Orange County on Thursday reported an 18.5% positivity rate. Florida Department of health data indicated the county has over 3000 new cases over the last two weeks though the popularity of at-home tests means many results go unreported; 167 in Orange are hospitalized according to Department of Health and Human Services data.

Making of the booster

Updates to the original vaccines were recommended amid concerns that their effectiveness to prevent infection waned over time and was very low against new omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 even as the protection they offered against severe disease seemed to hold up.

“We fully expect that the updated bivalent vaccines … will offer better protection against currently circulating strains than the original vaccines although it is difficult to predict at this point how much better that protection will be” said Dr. Anthony Fauci White House coronavirus response coordinator this week.

The new vaccine appears to be safe and effective though human clinical trials are still ongoing. Pfizer and Moderna originally designed this updated booster to target BA.1 the initial version of omicron that caused last winter’s record-breaking COVID-19 surge. When BA.4 and BA.5 developed to be even more infectious than the original version of omicron the FDA told the drugmakers to change course.

Though there wasn’t enough time to complete clinical trials for this new version before the fall rollout evidence of the safety and efficacy of the original and BA.1 boosters indicates this booster will also be safe and effective. The new vaccines use the same mRNA technology as the old ones.

“These vaccines are manufactured using the same process” an FDA news release says.

Clinical trial data from the BA.1 iteration suggests the booster incites mild side effects similar to the shots that came before it such as arm soreness fatigue and body aches.

Rarer side effects such as myocarditis may occur after vaccination however a CDC analysis of electronic health records from 40 U.S. health systems indicated myocarditis is more common after COVID-19 than it is after vaccination.

Fauci added this shot will potentially usher in a new era of annual COVID-19 shots —tweaked based on the subvariant expected to circulate that year — because the virus likely won’t evolve very far from BA.5.

“You’ve got to put the wildcard of a way-out out-of-left field variant coming in. If that happens all bets are off” Fauci said. “But if we continue to have an evolution of what we used to call and still do call an ‘influenza adrift’ — not a major change but just sort of drifting along the BA.5 sublineage — I believe that … we’ll be able to cover what is out there.”

Roberts agreed that drastically different variants will always be a concern for Florida but are unlikely.

“What’s going to happen is most mutations are going to deviate very very little from the original” she said. “And so if that’s the case the vaccines are still going to have enough activity that it won’t matter.”

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Story continues

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

Getting a star athlete on a video call for a reasonable fee was an easy sell to fans but not to the athletes—the company had so many athlete no-shows for calls that the effort was scuttled by constant refunds.

He has higher hopes for his second athlete venture: Finlete which keeps the fan meet-and-greet of the first effort but adds what should be a stronger motivator—more money.

“Finlete is a platform that allows fans to support for now minor league baseball players” Connolly said in a phone call. “And with the current amount of money that these athletes make in the minor leagues there’s a really interesting potential return that people participating in Finlete can see.”

Finlete is a new entry in the increasingly popular financial play of athlete investing in which funds swap an upfront payment to an aspiring pro in exchange for a fixed percentage cut of future sports income. Comcast owns 7% of Finlete’s business while famed venture capitalist Tim Draper has a $50000 seed investment in the endeavor.

For Finlete Connolly sees a lot of potential in farm team ballplayers partly because minor league baseball pays most players badly. Finlete’s first athlete Texas Rangers middle infield prospect Echedry Vargas signed with the club out of the Dominican Republic in 2022 for a $10000 bonus–the minimum at the time according to Connolly. Right now Vargas plays in A-ball where salaries max out at $27300. “He’s like a minimum wage guy … but outperforming players that signed for millions of dollars” the executive said.

Finlete is taking a crowd-funding approach selling shares in a Securities & Exchange Commission-registered offering to retail investors. Investors can buy shares in Vargas for $8 (with a 12-share minimum) with the player receiving a $500000 advance. In exchange investors get a claim of 10% of his baseball earnings for the next 25 years if he makes The Show or even if he ends up off-Broadway so to speak in the top pro leagues of Japan Korea and Taiwan according to the player agreement disclosed as part of the offering. If he fails to make the majors stateside or in Asia Vargas won’t owe anything. The offering is still raising money and has about $26000 in commitments according to the Finlete website.

The presence of smart money suggests there’s increasing traction with the idea of swapping a lump sum of cash now for a cut of athlete income later on. The current wave of start-ups was sparked by the initial success of Big League Advance a private fund that is best known for striking a deal with the now-superstar Fernando Tatis Jr. when he was a minor leaguer. Finlete joins the golf pro-focused Commonwealth Sports NFL player-backing Vestible and international soccer player investing Nordensa—which isn’t available to American investors—as more recent entrants to the budding scene.

Conscious of the other competitors in the space the company sees the carryover of the original Cameo-like idea as a key to drawing in fan investors; part of the pitch to athletes too is to build a cadre of supporters early. In Vargas’ case he commits to things such as signing 100 autographs annually and holding meet-and-greets with fans at games as perks to people buying a minimum number of shares and at least two 30-minute video-chat appearance annually under the deal.

“It’s like a PG version of OnlyFans” Connolly said. “You’re involved with the athlete on an intimate level. You get to be a part of the athlete’s journey you get to hear what they’re struggling with and what they’re working on.”

Such a relationship is also potentially lucrative for Finlete. If the current share offering in Vargas’ future income sells its maximum proposed level of $800000 (100000 shares) $300000 goes to cover the offering costs and reimbursements to Finlete. It’s not quite a fair comparison because certain costs aren’t proportional but a typical stock IPO sees about 5% of proceeds directed to expenses and commissions. Finlete also gets the right of first refusal to buy any future baseball-related income Vargas might consider selling.

“We want to do $100 million in revenue in two years. We want to create a trading platform that allows fans to buy and sell their positions … and have over 100 athletes on our platform from Nascar drivers to horse racing jockeys to baseball players and UFC fighters” Connolly said.

That’s a lot of hope riding on the shoulders of Vargas who is currently batting .227 for the Down East Wood Ducks of the Carolina League.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vMjQ3c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlL3V0YWgvYXJ0aWNsZS9taXJvLWxpdHRsZS10cmFuc2Zlci1wb3J0YWwtY29tbWl0bWVudC11dGFoLWJheWxvci1wZy10cmFuc2Zlci0tMjMxMzU1NDU3L9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vMjQ3c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlL3V0YWgvYXJ0aWNsZS9taXJvLWxpdHRsZS10cmFuc2Zlci1wb3J0YWwtY29tbWl0bWVudC11dGFoLWJheWxvci1wZy10cmFuc2Zlci0tMjMxMzU1NDU3L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BREAKING: Four-star transfer PG Miro Little has committed to Utah,"On Tuesday Craig Smith and the Runnin' Utes picked up a very valuable transfer portal addition after former Baylor guard and four-star transfer Miro Little announced his commitment to the program. This is a big recruiting win for the Runnin' Utes as they add a very promising young talent to the mix.

Little announced his commitment via Twitter:

As a 6-foot-4 185 pound guard Little shows the ability to do a bit of everything. He can be the primary ball handler he has a strong handle to go along with good feel for scoring opportunities for himself or others. He can score inside and out and can play off the ball as well. There are a lot of natural playmaking qualities that Little possesses and he's showcased good defensive ones as well. Despite the fact that he saw inconsistent playing time this past season he is still regarded as a four-star transfer prospect.

Utah brought Little in for an official visit this past weekend and were able to make a very good impression. Little is a native of Finland which gives the program valuable relationships in the form of Hanno Mottola Mikael Jantunen and even Lauri Markennan all of whom are connected through the Finland national team.

Little entered the portal after his first and only season with Baylor. The Bears had quite the logjam in the backcourt which led to him looking for a better opportunity elsewhere. Little still showcased his productive potential in games where he got extended playing time.

He is a former top 50 overall prospect and top 10 point guard in the 2023 recruiting class. He committed to Baylor over Indiana and Villanova while also having significant interest from other power programs in college basketball as well. Little earned a 94 four-star rating and No. 9 ranking in 247Sports' 2023 recruiting class.

Little did not play his ""senior year"" of high school at Sunrise Christian Academy but played for the Helsinki Basketball Academy (HBA) in Finland. HBA is a part of the Finland 1st Division basketball league and is essentially a high school program competing against professional players in Finland. Little averaged 21.6 points 9.0 rebounds and 5.8 assists in 20 games in this league during the 2021-22 season.

He joins Utah with three seasons of eligibility and a redshirt remaining. He is the fourth transfer addition and joins Keanu Dawes Mason Madsen and Zach Keller in Utah's transfer portal class. Utah now has five open spots remaining on the roster.

Born in Alamosa Co. on July 10 1939 to Marjorie and Clem Phillips Jim graduated from Alamosa High School and soon after he and his brother Bob took over operations of Phillips Trucking their father’s trucking business. While operating his trucking business Jim married Judy Kaye Welcher on December 21 1963 and they raised their two sons James Donald and John Edward Phillips in Alamosa. After many years serving their trucking business customers throughout the San Luis Valley much of Colorado and New Mexico Jim and Bob sold their trucking business and Jim began his career as a real estate broker with Century 21 and Hay-Brownlow real estate agencies. After 66 years of living and working in Alamosa Jim retired from real estate and in 2006 moved to Abilene Texas to be closer to his sons. While in Abilene Jim loved going to church and watching all sporting events at Abilene Christian University (ACU) where both his sons attended college. Jim then moved to Burleson Texas where his son James Donald currently resides and made new friends and connections in the Burleson Church of Christ and his community.

Prior to his passing Jim talked about what he hoped people would remember about him. With the clarity of a young man Jim said he loved living in the San Luis Valley and cherished all the friends he made in his 66 years living in Alamosa. At only 17 years of age he drove one of his dad’s diesel trucks over La Veta Pass with a full load of livestock. Jim often talked to his sons and grandkids about the countless trucking trips he made over various snowy passes and roads throughout Southern and Central Colorado and Northern New Mexico. He would also talk about the many days he spent in the Alamosa “Sale Barn” where he picked up the ability to auctioneer. Jim found joy and fulfillment serving others through real estate and eventually owned 10 rent homes throughout Alamosa. In 1999 Jim was the #1 Real Estate Commissions Agent in the Century 21 Southern District and the #2 overall Century 21 Real Estate Agent in all of Colorado. He was proud of the time he invested at the Alamosa and Monte Vista Churches of Christ his 53 years of marriage to Judy and always reminded people he had “the best” daughters-in-law and grand babies who he loved “very very very much”. Jim’s family will always remember him for his sincere love of all his family and friends hard work-ethic stories of growing up and living in Southern Colorado enjoyment of horse racing casinos and watching his favorite sports teams including any team on which his kids or grandkids played the Denver Broncos The University of Texas Longhorns ACU Wildcats and Texas Rangers.

The International Olympic Committee’s Executive Board met on Thursday and sent a stern letter of disappointment to the International Boxing Association further dimming its chances to be on the LA28 sports program and set the stage for suspensions of National Olympic Committees in Guatemala and India. The current sanctions situation for Russia (and Belarus) remains unchanged. The John Hancock insurance firm decided to end its sponsorship of the Boston Marathon after the 2023 race after 37 years; it was one of the early leaders in the 1980s sports sponsorship explosion.

Diamond League wins for Bromell Lyles Holloway Allman & Winger in Zurich

The 2022 Diamond League season came to a spectacular close at the legendary Stadion Letzigrund with the Weltklasse Zurich meet on Thursday with three world-leading performances and five wins by American athletes. The world leaders:

● Men/800 m: 1:43.26 Emmanuel Korir (KEN)

● Men/1500 m: 3:29.02 Jakob Ingebrigtsen (NOR)

● Women/400 m: 48.99 Marileidy Paulino (DOM)

In the men’s sprints it was American Trayvon Bromell who got out best and could not be caught winning in 9.94 (wind: 0.3 m/s) well ahead of Yohan Blake (JAM: 10.05) and Aaron Brown (CAN: 10.06). American Kyree King was seventh in 10.18.

American star Noah Lyles closed the program with another brilliant 200 m steaming around the turn and running away with the race in 19.52 (-0.6) his sixth time at 19.62 or better this season! Brown and Alexander Ogando (DOM) were tight for second and third (both in 20.02) with Americans Erriyon Knighton and Kenny Bednarek fading to 4-5 both in 20.20.

Evergreen Kirani James (GRN) still just 30 won the men’s 400 m in an impressive 44.26 with Americans Bryce Deadmon and Vernon Norwood just behind in 44.47 and 44.66.

Both the men’s 800 m and 1500 m produced world-leading marks. Canada’s Marco Arop came into the final straight as the leader and looking like the winner but Olympic and World champ Emmanuel Korir (KEN) attacked and got to the lead only in the last 5 m winning in 1:43.26 with Arop at 1:43.38. American Bryce Hoppel was fifth in 1:44.77.

Norway’s Jakob Ingebrigtsen the Olympic champ found himself in the lead at the 1500 m bell being stalked by familiar foe 2019 World Champion Timothy Cheruiyot (KEN). But no one could match Ingebrigtsen’s fitness and he pulled away over the final 120 m to win in a world-leading 3:29.02. Cheruiyot was a clear second in 3:30.27 and Olli Hoare (AUS: 3:30.59) was third.

The three “hurdles” races showcased the 2022 World Champions. American Grant Holloway stormed out of the blocks and won the 110 m hurdles in 13.02 (-1.0) ahead of a fast-closing Rasheed Broadbell (JAM: 13.06). American Trey Cunningham was fifth in 13.30. Brazil’s Alison Dos Santos left no doubt in the 400 m hurdles taking over by mid-race and winning in 46.98 his third sub-47 race of the year with Americans Khallifah Rosser (47.76) and C.J. Allen (48.21) second and third. And Morocco’s Soufiane El Bakkali was in total control of the Steeple winning in 8:07.67 ahead of a fast-closing Getnet Wale (ETH: 8:08.56) and Abraham Kibiwot (KEN: 8:08.61).

Jamaica continued to own the women’s sprints as Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce got out first and won by daylight in the women’s 100 m over teammate Shericka Jackson 10.65-10.81 (-0.8). Americans Aleia Hobbs TeeTee Terry and Sha’Carri Richardson finished 5-6-7 in 11.03-11.10-11.13. Jackson was totally in charge in the 200 m storming the turn and taking a big lead to win in 21.80 (-0.9) more than a half-second up on Americans Gabby Thomas Tamara Clark and Jenna Prandini in 22.38-22.42-22.45.

The continuing rise of Dominican star Marileidy Paulino was shown by her world-leading win in the 400 m in 48.99 way ahead of countrywoman Fiordaliza Cofil (49.93). Worlds silver winner Paulino is only the 12th woman ever to break the 49-second barrier and just the fifth this century.

Worlds bronze medalist Mary Moraa of Kenya found herself in front on the backstraight of the women’s 800 m and made the most of it extending her edge in the home straight and winning impressively in 1:57.63 ahead of a late rush by Jamaican Natoya Goule (1:57.85) and American Sage Hurta (1:58.47). Fellow Kenyan star Faith Kipyegon – the two-time Olympic champ – underlined her dominance with a 4:00.04 win in the 1500 m taking off on the final lap and not seriously challenged. Ireland’s Ciara Mageean ran strongly down the straight and got second in 4:01.68. Americans Heather MacLean and Cory McGee were 7-8 in 4:02.90 and 4:04.63.

The stars were out in the women’s hurdles as well. World Champion and world-record setter Tobi Amusan (NGR) overpowered an excellent field from the start and won the 100 m hurdles in a fast 12.29 (-0.3) the equal-18th fastest mark ever and no. 10 this century. American Tia Jones continued a late-season surge in second (12.40) with Olympic champ Jasmine Camacho-Quinn fourth (12.49) and Americans Nia Ali and Keni Harrison in sixth and eighth (12.67 and 13.02).

Dutch star Femke Bol overtook Rio Olympic champ Dalilah Muhammad of the U.S. by midway in the 400 m hurdles and won in 53.03 – a time only Bol and Sydney McLaughlin have beaten this season – with Gianna Woodruff (PAN) second in 53.72 as Muhammad faded to fourth (53.83). Ethiopia’s Werkuha Getachew was strongest in the final half-lap to win the Steeple in 9:03.57 from Winfred Yavi (BRN: 9:04.47) with American Emma Coburn seventh in 9:20.00.

The women’s high jump was decided at 1.97 m (6-5 1/2) with Ukraine’s World Indoor Champion Yaroslava Mahuchikh clearing on her second try while teammate Iryna Gerashchenko finished second from her first-time clearance at 1.94 m (6-4 1/4).

The men’s vault really got going at 5.81 m (19-0 3/4) with Mondo Duplantis (SWE) over right away and joined by Norway’s Sondre Guttormsen on his second attempt France’s 2012 Olympic champ Renaud Lavillenie and Tokyo silver winner Chris Nilsen (USA). Guttormsen got a lifetime best of 5.86 m (19-2 3/4) and that earned him second place as Nilsen and Lavillenie both failed at 5.91 m (19-4 3/4) to settle at 3-4. Duplantis made 5.91 m on his first try and then asked for 6.07 m (19-11) which he cleared on his second attempt but went no higher.

The long jumps were an intertwined men’s and women’s event alternating round by round. Serbia’s Ivana Vuleta took charge of the women’s event right away jumping 6.97 m (22-10 1/2) in the first round and won easily. Swede Khaddi Sagnia managed 6.55 m (21-6) for second and American Quanesha Burks got out to 6.54 m (21-5 1/2) in the sixth round to get third.

Greece’s Olympic champ Miltiadis Tentoglu reached 8.14 m (26-8 1/2) in the men’s competition in the second round but it was American Marquis Dendy – the 2016 World Indoor Champion wearing a stylish bucket hat – taking the lead at 8.16 m (26-9 1/4) in round four! Tentoglu responded re-taking the lead at 8.33 m (27-4) then Dendy improved to 8.18 m (26-10) in the final round but it wasn’t enough. But Tentoglu wanted to make a statement and powered out to 8.42 m (27-7 1/2) on his final jump for the winning mark his no. 3 jump of the year.

In the triple jumps Cuba’s Andy Diaz boomed his first-round jump out to a lifetime best of 17.70 m (58-1) and no one could catch him. World Champion Pedro Pablo Pichardo (POR) also had his best mark in the first round at 17.63 m (57-10 1/4) and finished second. Women’s Olympic and World Champion Yulimar Rojas (VEN) fouled on her first try but reached 15.28 m (50-1 3/4) in the second and won easily with her eighth-best jump of the year. Ukraine’s Maryna Bekh-Romanchuk claimed second at 14.96 m (49-1) and American Tori Franklin finished fourth at 14.75 m (48-4 3/4).

The discus competitions saw men’s World Champion Kristjian Ceh (SLO) and Olympic gold medalist Valarie Allman of the U.S. take the early leads at 64.42 m (211-4) and 66.23 m (217-3) respectively. Ceh lost the lead to Lukas Weisshaidinger (AUT) in round five at 65.70 m (215-7) but took it back immediately at 66.75 m (219-0) and then finished with a best of 67.10 m (220-2). American Sam Mattis finished fourth at 65.24 m (214-0).

Allman improved to 67.77 m (222-4) in round three and while two-time Olympic champ Sandra Perkovic (SLO) got close at 67.31 m (220-10) in round five she finished second. American Laulaga Tausaga was sixth at 58.90 m (193-3).

The amazing Kara Winger the Worlds silver medalist and American record holder – who has said she will retire at the end of the season – had the women’s javelin lead at 63.81 m (209-4) in the second round ahead of World Champion Kelsey-Lee Barber (AUS: 63.72 m/209-1). Then Winger poured it on adding to the lead at 64.98 m (213-2) the no. 5 throw of her career! Retire at 36? Really? When she is automatically qualified for the 2023 Worlds?

India’s Olympic champ Neeraj Chopra grabbed control of the men’s spear reaching 88.44 m (290-2) in round two ahead of Tokyo silver medalist Jakub Vadlejch (CZE: 86.94 m/288-6) and that’s the way it finished. American Curtis Thompson was fourth at 82.10 m (269-4).

The winners of each event took home $30000 in prize money with the lower places earning $12000-7000-4000-2500-2000-1500-1000 through eighth. Most of the winners will get a direct entry into the 2023 World Championships except in situations where the Diamond League champ comes from the same country as the 2022 World Champion (to be resolved later).

(Thanks to statistician Jed Brickner for a correction to yesterday’s post: Joe Kovacs’ throw of 23.23 m (76-2 3/4) made him the no. 2 performer in history but with the no. 3 throw ever behind Ryan Crouser’s 23.37 m (76-8 1/4) and 23.30 m (76-5 1/2) both in 2021.)

IOC reiterates “grave concerns” over Int’l Boxing Association

The International Olympic Committee’s Executive Board completed the first of a two-day meeting on Thursday delivering some stern warnings to the International Boxing Association and to the National Olympic Committees of Guatemala and India.

On boxing the IOC sent a stern letter to the IBA which ended with:

“Boxing is currently not included in the sports programme of the Olympic Games Los Angeles 2028. Considering the absence of a real evolution the IOC Executive Board is not in a position to reverse this decision and will continue to monitor with grave concerns IBA’s governance.”

The letter reiterated the IOC’s continuing concerns over governance and finance. In specific the IBA’s termination of its reform advisory committee and the weakening of its formal headquarters functions in Lausanne in favor of a “Presidential office in Moscow” were noted as negatives as well as

‘[A]ccording to the information available the IBA has not been able to find new sources of income to mitigate its dependency from a Russian State-owned company [Gazprom]. Furthermore the IOC Executive Board noted that this situation is exacerbated by the fact that IBA is dependent from a Russian State-owned bank’s branch located in Switzerland which is currently restricted in operation due to sanctions in place.”

The IOC’s view is that IBA’s actions “aggravate the most serious concerns of the IOC Executive Board.” The outcome of the upcoming Congress in Armenia on 25 September which could include a re-vote for President “will be thoroughly assessed.”

A qualification system for boxing for Paris 2024 was set up rejecting the IBA’s proposal and using the results of the 2023 Asian Games European Games Pacific Games Pan American Games and an African competition to be designated and two worldwide qualifiers in 2024.

That’s boxing. On the other at-issue federations IOC Sports Director Kit McConnell (NZL) said that discussions are continuing with the newly-elected leadership of the International Weightlifting Federation and with the Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne. On the UIPM McConnell made it clear that the IOC is waiting on the federation’s proposal for a different fifth discipline for 2028 and is well aware of the internal dissension among the sport’s elite athletes about the decision to remove riding.

As regards continuing governance crises with two National Olympic Committees:

● The Executive Board suspended the National Olympic Committee of Guatemala as of 15 October as the country’s courts have suspended some of the NOC’s election rules in violation of the Olympic Charter’s requirement of sports autonomy.

The five-week delay was set in hopes of settling the dispute with the government in advance of the 24-sport Central American Games to be contested in Guatemala and Costa Rica beginning on 27 October 2022. The Guatemalan NOC and the government are expected to meet shortly on the issue with the IOC looking for a solution by 25 September.

● The Indian Olympic Association is also dealing with election issues and was previously suspended for similar problems from 2012-14. So a “final warning” was issued with the Executive Board asking for a resolution by its next meeting in December and orchestrating a meeting “with all parties concerned” in Lausanne later in September.

However with the 2023 IOC Session to be held in Mumbai the Executive Board postponed it to a date to be determined in September or October instead of next May or June and could be relocated elsewhere.

This impacts the ongoing discussions concerning the selection of a site for the 2030 Olympic Winter Games which was to be voted on at the Mumbai Session. It is possible that the delay due to India’s internal issues could help the fledgling bid in Vancouver which has been behind the bids from Salt Lake City and Sapporo.

For Paris 2024 venue changes already announced were confirmed for boxing and fencing in the modern pentathlon (North Paris Arena) for shooting (French National Shooting Centre) and the Main Press Center (Palais de Congres). The contentious fight over the preliminary basketball site continues.

Reports on future Games were received by the Executive Board with the continuing turmoil over the management of Milan Cortina 2026 being monitored. The Los Angeles 2028 Coordination Commission is scheduled to visit the city for an in-person look from 13-15 September.

A potentially important new working group has been created to continue the Tokyo 2020 concept of streamlining the costs and operations of the Olympic Games dubbed the “Games Optimisation Group” and chaired by Zimbabwean IOC member (and Olympic swimming champ) Kirsty Coventry.

IOC says Russian status remains unchanged

IOC spokesman Mark Adams (GBR) noted that the situation with Russia (and Belarus) has not changed and gave one of the clearest statements of the IOC’s position to date:

“The sanctions are against those responsible for the war the Russian government; they remain in place. This means in particular … no Russian flag or colors no Russian anthem no Russian identity at sporting events and also the International Federations should not hold events in Russia.

“With regard to the protective measures which we recommended to the Olympic Movement we have explained many times that we are in a dilemma. We did decide on the protective measures because the IOC had to realize that governments were starting to interfere in the responsibility of sports organizations by deciding who would be allowed to participate in international sports competitions and by putting pressure on their athletes [National Olympic Committees] and national federations.

“This obviously jeopardizes the integrity and fairness of international competitions jeopardizes the autonomy of sports organizations without which there can be no truly global sport. So to protect the integrity of the competitions and to protect international sport from full politicalization we had to take some protective measures.

“We had to take these measures reluctantly because as I said in an unsolvable dilemma. On the one hand we cannot fully live up to our humanitarian mission which is to unite the entire world in peaceful competition. On the other hand the only way to protect this mission for the future was to recommend the non-participation of athletes just because of their nationality.

“We are obviously closely monitoring and will continue to closely monitor the situation.”

Sports Director McConnell further noted:

“Our recommendations regarding Russia are related to the integrity of sports competitions and protecting that integrity. We have not in any way recommended the sanctioning of the Russian Olympic Committee Russian national federations or Russian officeholders.”

Adams explained that the IOC’s assistance fund for Ukrainian athletes and sports organization has now expanded to $7.5 million.

John Hancock to end 37-year sponsorship of Boston Marathon

“Our contract with the Boston Athletic Association is expiring in 2023 and after careful review we have chosen not to renew our principal sponsorship of the Boston Marathon after next year’s race.

“Our business has changed so much over the nearly four decades of our sponsorship; we have grown in size and scale and are more globally aligned than ever before. As our organization evolves and we double down on opportunities to help customers live longer healthier lives through our John Hancock Vitality program our partnerships must also evolve.”

That from a letter to the staff by Marianne Harrison the chief executive of Boston-based insurer John Hancock announcing the end of a partnership that lasted for 37 years back to 1986. Hancock was in the forefront of sports sponsorship in the marketing explosion that followed the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles and was deeply involved in running for many years.

The Boston Athletic Association which owns the race issued a statement; in part:

“At the B.A.A. our commitment to expanding events and creating more running opportunities has never been greater. We’re excited to find our next Boston Marathon principal sponsor and look forward to partnering with an organization who shares our passion for athletic excellence community engagement and growing the Boston Marathon to new heights.”

John Hancock has been steadily scaling back its sports sponsorships ending its 30-year relationship with the Boston Red Sox in July.

Although 37 years is a long partnership it’s not a record. For example in 2019 USA Swimming announced a multi-year extension with Phillips 66 which began sponsoring the federation back in 1973!

Evenepoel closing in on La Vuelta title with Stage 18 win

The best to protect your lead at the head of the 77th La Vuelta a Espana is to win the stage. And that’s exactly what Belgium’s Remco Evenepoel did on Thursday out-sprinting chief rival Enric Mas (ESP) to the line at the top of the 1163 m Alto de Piornal.

Thursday’s 192 km route was flat for the first half but featured three major climbs to the finish with the final ascent of 13.3 km the decisive stretch. Mas attacked with 10 km remaining but was reeled in by the Belgian. Dutch rider Robert Gesink was in the lead with just 1000 m to go when Mas attacked once again but Evenepoel struck back hard and managed to get to the line first with Mas and Gesink both two seconds back.

With two more climbing stages left before the final-day ride into Madrid Evenepoel had a lead of 2:07 on Mas and 5:14 on Juan Ayuso (ESP). If the 22-year-old Evenepoel can hang on he will be the first Belgian winner since Freddy Maertens way back in 1977.

≡ WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS ≡

● Volleyball ● The semifinals are set for the 20th edition of the FIVB men’s World Championship in Poland with defending champion Poland (5-0) to face Brazil (5-0) and 4-1 Slovenia playing 5-0 Italy.

In Thursday’s quarterfinals the Poles took a 2-0 lead on the U.S. winning by 25-20 and 27-25. But the Americans fought back and tied to match with set wins of 25-21 and 25-21. But the home team playing in Gliwice managed a 15-12 fifth set win to advance.

Brazil had an easier time with Argentina winning 3-1 but only after dropping the first set.

The semis will be played on Saturday and the medal matches on Sunday all at the 11036-capacity Spodek Arena in Katowice.

≡ PANORAMA ≡

● Pan American Games ● In view of receding interest in the Pan American Games as a stand-alone championship in recent editions – in part due to the lack of prize money vs. other events – the regional confederation Pan Am Sports made a strategic move to emphasize the role of the Games as an Olympic qualifying competition as a way to ensure strong participation by the best athletes in the hemisphere.

That effort has gone into overdrive for 2023 as 33 disciplines across 22 sports will offer either direct qualification (in 15 sports) or points toward qualifying marks or world rankings on which Olympic selection will be based (in 7 sports). This is up from 25 disciplines at the Lima 2019 Games.

This also applies to the Paralympic Games with 15 (of 18) disciplines offering qualifying opportunities; six sports will provide direct qualifying from the ParaPan American Games.

The Santiago 2023 Pan Ams are expected to include more than 7000 athletes and 2000 para-athletes from the 41 countries of the Americas competing in 39 sports (61 disciplines) and 17 para-sports (18 disciplines). The Games will be held late next year from 20 October to 5 November.

● World Anti-Doping Agency ● WADA announced the appointments of 13 members of the WADA Athlete Council including five from the IOC or International Paralympic Committee Athlete Commissions and eight elected by the Athlete Commissions of International Federations.

The IOC/IPC appointments include Finland’s Emma Terho 40 currently the head of the IOC’s Athletes’ Commission whose profile in international sport had been steadily increasing.

Among the International Federation reps is American Clare Egan 34 nominated by the International Biathlon Union and a two-time Olympian in 2018 and 2022. She retired after the 2021-22 season.

● Athletics ● Thursday’s Diamond League Final in Zurich was shown on NBC’s Peacock streaming service live but will be shown on CNBC on Saturday at noon Eastern time.

However Sunday’s Fifth Avenue Mile from New York will be shown live on NBC beginning at noon with the women’s elite race at 12:30 p.m. and the men’s race at 12:45.

● Basketball ● The U.S. men’s team barely got past Puerto Rico 85-84 to advance to the semifinals of the FIBA AmeriCup in Recife Brazil.

The game was tied 42-42 at the half and the U.S. had a tenuous 64-60 lead after three quarters. In the fourth a three-pointer by guard Norris Cole gave the U.S. an 82-76 edge with 2:05 left but the game was tied at 82-82 with 0:09 to play. A Cole free throw made it 83-82 for the U.S. but ex-LSU star Tremont Waters got a layin with six seconds left to put Puerto Rico in front 84-83.

Out of a timeout Cole took over dribbling from 25 feet out down the left side of the lane and muscling up an in-the-paint 8-ft. floater which swished through the net with just 1.4 seconds left for the win and the 85-84 final. Cole led all scorers with 20 points on 8-11 shooting with guard Jeremy Pargo scoring 15.

The U.S. will meet undefeated Argentina in the semis a 76-53 winner over Venezuela on Saturday (10th).

● Diving ● “It’s with great contentment and excitement I close this chapter and move on to the next. You always hear people say you’ll know when it’s time to hang it up and I never really believed that. I do now. I took my final dive at Olympic Trials in 2021 and the following months were rough. But ever since that dive not once have I had a feeling of ‘I need to get back in’.”

That’s American diving star David Boudia 33 announcing his retirement in an Instagram post concluding a brilliant career that included three Olympic Games in Beijing London and Rio where he won gold in 2012 on the 10 m Platform and a bronze in the 10 m Synchro and a silver (10 m Synchro) and bronze (10 m Platform) in 2016.

He won five World Championships medals (0-4-1) between 2007 and 2015 including individual Platform silvers in 2011-13-15.

Boudia is hardly leaving the sport however:

“As many of you know I am coaching along side Adam Soldati at Purdue University and I couldn’t be more eager to continue to learn from one of the best. I look forward to continuing to be immersed in the diving world as a coach and see what the next chapter holds. Eyes set for Paris 2024 just in a new role!”

The delays were mostly centered in the West Valley but also occurred at games in Central Phoenix and the East Valley.

The Arizona Republic's high school football game of the Week on Friday night between Phoenix Pinnacle and Liberty in Peoria was postponed until 7 p.m. Saturday.

Lightning in the area initially delayed the start of the game. With about 20 minutes before the 7 p.m. kickoff the public-address announcer called for all fans to head to their cars or a safe place. Players and coaches from both schools went to the locker rooms. But ater more than an hour delay the decision was made to play on Saturday at 7 p.m.

Games at Cactus High School in Glendale and Camelback High School also were either delayed or stopped because of the lightning with the Cactus game against ALA Queen Creek eventually canceled for the night and rescheduled to resume at 11 a.m. Saturday.

The Brophy-Centennial game was postponed unti Saturday after a lengthy lightning delay. The Peoria-ALA Foothills West game also was postponed but until Monday evening.

And in the East Valley the weather was having an impact. The Corona del Sol at Chandler game started after a delay due to the weather but later was stopped again and the stadium emptied before again resuming.

Saguaro at Queen Creek also had a weather delay but eventually started play. The Chaparral at Williams Field game continued in a downpour.

This is the second consecutive Friday that weather has impacted high school football games in the Valley.

The Hamilton-Centennial game didn't start until nearly 1 hour 30 minutes after its original start time.

Phoenix St. Mary's and Combs moved the game from Friday night to Saturday morning in San Tan Valley where St. Mary's won the game 21-15.

We’ll highlight seven of them yielding 4% or more in a moment.

By the way this sector-at-large has returned 4% including dividends year-to-date (YTD). While that may not make us rich it is the best record on the scoreboard this side of energy:

Why utilities? As always these stocks pay and they don’t drop as much in price as the broader market. A useful quality in a dumpster-fire market.

Utilities are expensive however They currently trade at nearly 21 times forward earnings—near their highest forward P/E in decades and well above the S&P 500 forward P/E of 17.7. And if there’s any sector to be cautious about in the name of value it’s utilities where future growth is extremely unlikely to be brisk enough to make up for a valuation handicap.

But we’re not here for P/Es we’re here for dividends. Let’s review the seven utility stocks that are paying 4% or better as I write.

OGE Energy (OGE 4.0% yield) whose OG&E (Oklahoma Gas & Electric) serves nearly 900000 customers across Oklahoma or Arkansas is a sturdy place to start. I’ve highlighted this “good egg” before—specifically earlier this year when it was hitting 52-week highs. It has plateaued since then but it hasn’t given up many of its gains. OGE has recently merged its midstream business with Energy Transfer LP (ET) to become a pure-play electric utility. Strong cost controls and a steadily growing dividend make the case for holding the stock—but perhaps wait for the dip. While its forward P/E of 18.9 is cheaper than the sector average it’s not cheaper by much and it’s still more expensive than the broader market.

OGE: Still Below 2020 Highs But Not Cheap Anymore Either



A little more attractive from a valuation perspective is Spire (SR 4.0% yield) which trades about level with the market at 17.8 times forward earnings. Spire is the nation’s fifth-largest publicly traded natural-gas company serving 1.7 million customers across Alabama Mississippi and Missouri.

More than 90% of its business is regulated utility activity (the rest is gas marketing) which means it offers very predictable income—so when this low-vol darling says it’s targeting 5%-7% EPS growth you can take that to the bank. That’s a healthy level of growth for a utility by the way and it will be helped along by the recently announced expansion of nat-gas storage facilities in Wyoming. Spire will invest about $200 million to grow the facilities to 39 billion cubic feet (Bcf) from 23 Bcf which should be accretive to earnings by 2024 or 2025.

Northwest Natural Holding (NWN 4.1% yield) is also worth a look at 17.7 times forward earnings. The company serves more than 2.5 million nat-gas customers across the Pacific Northwest. Of particular interest is NWN’s moves into “renewable natural gas” (aka biogas)—a zero-carbon resource made from things such as forestry waste and landfills. It has delivered more than two decades of uninterrupted dividend growth though that payout growth is flattening.

NWN’s Dividend Growth: Right Direction But Needs More Velocity



Allete (ALE 4.3% yield) has a number of operations including Minnesota Power an electric utility serving 145000 residents and several large industrial customers; Superior Water Light and Power in Superior Wisconsin; and Allete Clean Energy which develops green energy projects. Its aggressive push into renewable resources such as solar and wind is commendable—it aims for a 70% share of energy coming from renewables by 2030—but that could make it a riskier play in the short-term. It is cheap though at a sub-16 forward P/E.

Avista (AVA 4.3% yield) isn’t so cheap. It serves electricity to more than 400000 customers and natural gas to 369000 customers across four northwestern states; it also provides retail electric serve in the city and borough of Juneau Alaska. Roughly 60% of its current energy mix is renewables. Its 18.0 forward P/E is a little more expensive than the market though not atrocious. More worrisome is its price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 4.3. PEG which is based around 1.0 (lower than 1.0 is underpriced higher than 1.0 is overpriced) factors in future growth making it the great equalizer of valuation metrics—and by this metric AVA is far pricier than its peers.

The same goes for Northwestern Corp. (NWE 4.7% yield). Northwestern a clean-energy-heavy utility boasts that 44% of the energy it provides for South Dakota comes from wind projects and 59% of its generation in Montana is from carbon-free sources. (It also powers parts of Nebraska.) The forward P/E is great at 16.3 and the yield is the highest on this list—and that dividend has been growing each year since 2008. But factor in growth expectations and the PEG is a nosebleed 5.15—for a utility that has actually declined by high single digits in a good year for utilities no less!

NWE Has Separated From the Pack—In the Wrong Direction



Pinnacle West (PNW 4.5% yield) is a fascinating case. This utility provides nearly 1.3 million Arizona customers with electricity. It’s not wildly overpriced at an 18.2 forward P/E; its PEG of 3.10 is technically overpriced but actually cheaper than the average utility; and it yields well more than the sector average at 4.5%.

But there’s reason for caution. Last year Guggenheim analyst Shahriar Pourreza said Arizona “has now confirmed that they are the single most value destructive regulatory environment in the country”—a rate case with the Arizona Corporation Commission hobbled PNW’s earnings potential and caused Fitch to downgrade its debt.

It’s Not Too Late: Lock In the “Recession-Resistant Portfolio” Now!

So we might not want to start buying the likes of NEW or PNW but we’ve got the right idea here—and we still want to buy stocks that share the sector’s most prominent trait:

Recession-resistance.

While every major market index has been dead money in 2022 and while most of the darlings of the stock market have been getting crushed a small overlooked basket of recession-resistant stocks haven’t just been surviving—they’ve been setting up to thrive.

To the uninformed investor these stocks will seem downright boring. In fact I’m betting that you haven’t heard of any of these—after all the mainstream media rarely covers some of them and it outright ignores others.

But these “Hidden Yield stocks” offer savvy investors the potential to double their money roughly every five years regardless of what the wider market does.

How can they do this when even idiot-proof blue chips can’t?

It all boils down to what I call “The Three Pillars”:

Pillar #1: Consistent Dividend Hikes

Pillar #2: Lagging Stock Price

Pillar #3: Stock Buybacks

Selecting companies with a proven track of increasing their dividend payments is the safest most reliable way to get rich in the stock market. And I want to show you how it’s done.

Anthony Honeyball Racing is among 12 leading trainers in the West Country hosting open days.

Across Britain more than 180 venues will be open offering the public the chance to see the love nurture and attention to detail that goes into caring for racehorses.

The open days are free to attend and people of all ages are welcome offering a fantastic family day out in the countryside.

Visitors will have the opportunity to meet the stars of the sport up close and meet the team of staff and professionals who ensure that these equine athletes lead happy lives both during their career in racing and after they have retired.

The industry employs more than 6000 people most of whom are in some way involved in providing the highest level of care to these magnificent animals 365 days of the year.

The nationwide event runs from September 10 to 18 and was launched in 2021 with great success.

Potwell Farm was once a dairy farm and is set amidst the west Dorset countryside. Over the past decade it has gradually evolved from a small stud with one barn and a tack room.

Anthony began his involvement with horses back at his family home on the Quantocks. He both worked and rode as an amateur for Richard Barber and progressed as a conditional jockey for Paul Nicholls riding 45 winners under rules before he began his training career in 2006.

Rachael Honeyball wife and assistant trainer to Anthony started out in the eventing world working for international event riders and competing up to intermediate level before the racing took over. Her initial point to point victory aged 19 was while working for Robert Alner in 2002 at Ston Easton on Ski Seal who was trained by Anthony’s mother Sue. Rachael later joined Richard Barber’s stable where she became National point to point champion riding over 100 winners on the point to point circuit and over 75 under rules so far.

In 2021 the St. Mary’s County Equity Task Force in partnership with the Housing Authority of St. Mary’s County (HASMC) announced plans for the St. Mary’s County Health Hub.

The 6200 square-foot facility located at 21625 Great Mills Road in Lexington Park was donated by PNC Bank to HASMC to be used by the health department for COVID-19 pandemic response behavioral health crisis stabilization services and other programs to promote wellness. SMCHD and a variety of community partners will roll these services out over the next several months.



Currently the Health Hub offers a broad range of scientifically proven interventions through the SMCHD Harm Reduction Program to promote safety infection prevention and recovery for community members with a substance use disorder. COVID-19 testing and vaccine appointments have also been available at the Health Hub location.

Future Hub services planned for launch over the next several months include:

Behavioral health crisis stabilization services

Jail diversion programs that emphasize mental health and substance use treatment

Primary care health services (e.g. routine preventative care immunizations health screenings diagnosis/treatment etc.)

Coaching workshops and other trainings to support violence prevention conflict resolution housing stability employment and financial well-being literacy and academic tutoring and youth mentoring

“The health department team is grateful for our partnership with PNC Bank the Sheriff’s Office Public Schools and Housing Authority in establishing this facility and for the support of our state and local elected officials in getting it ready. Many community partners are coming together to turn the vision for this Health Hub into a reality” said Dr. Meena Brewster St. Mary’s County Health Officer. “This facility and the private-public partnership supporting its use will greatly benefit our community members and their families. We’re excited to get it going!”

Veolia North America's advertising has sparked criticism from the plaintiffs' attorney and raised concerns with legal and digital marketing experts who question whether the timing of the digital advertising targeted the prospective jury pool or the judge or if it otherwise sought to influence the outcome of the trial from beyond the courthouse walls — accusations the company rejects.

Although experts have expressed serious concerns about the practice they add it might be protected by the First Amendment.

The ad blitz kicked off last fall after a trial date was set by a federal judge with the number of keyword ads increasing steadily from September 2021 to July according to publicly available data from third-party analytics sites reviewed by The Detroit News. The third-party analytics revealed Veolia more than tripled the number of keyword search terms on Google where advertisements for its website VeoliaFlintFacts.com appeared during that time.

Throughout the civil trial Veolia's digital ads with such headlines as “Veolia wrongly blamed” and ""Veolia offered Flint help"" appeared on computers and mobile phones nationally including in Ann Arbor and other areas of southeast Michigan where the jury pool was selected.

“Not only did Veolia play a significant role in poisoning a community but they’ve now put my clients as well as honest witnesses a federal judge and the legal system as a whole at the center of a well-orchestrated corporate disinformation campaign” said Corey Stern an attorney at the New York law firm Levy Konigsberg.

“... And if a single juror was affected by Veolia’s insidious efforts then we ought to light the Constitution on fire and start holding our trials in Moscow.”

During the trial Veolia's paid search engine-generated ads at times appeared multiple times on a Google search result page that could be viewed at the federal courthouse in Ann Arbor where lawyers for the company and engineering firm Lockwood Andrews & Newnam (LAN) were staving off a jury verdict finding liability inside.

A judge declared a mistrial in early August after jurors deadlocked on whether the two companies were to blame for Flint's water becoming tainted with lead in 2014-15 when the Genesee County city started using the corrosive Flint River for its drinking water. Veolia was hired by the city to conduct an evaluation of Flint's water treatment plant operations.

In response to the accusations over its ads Veolia a Boston-based water services company and a subsidiary of the $30 billion French conglomerate Veolia explained it ""never targeted any specific state or region"" with them for the Veolia Flint Facts website according to company spokeswoman Tarrah Cooper Wright.

""To ensure that people who were searching for information got the truth six years ago VNA created (VeoliaFlintFacts.com) as a comprehensive and accurate resource for anyone looking for the facts about Flint"" Cooper Wright said in a statement to The News. ""As a standard practice in most companies once a new website is created keyword­-based ads are placed and VNA's ran across the United States and Canada. The ads have never targeted any specific state or region and have not been edited since the site was created.

""It's obvious that the trial lawyers are disappointed with the outcome of the trial but any claim that (Veolia) attempted to influence the jury pool through a website that contains public information is just as weak as the case they just lost.""

Advertising data from third-party analytics sites that frequently crawl search engines indicate the first Google search ads for the website were placed in July 2016 after VeoliaFlintFacts.com launched within days of being sued. Advertising from multiple analytics sites indicates a lull in Google advertising activity by late 2017 before picking up again at the end of 2019 as settlement negotiations between plaintiffs' attorneys and several entities were reaching an inflection point.

Data also shows Veolia broadened its use of Google ads in October and sustained the ad blitz through July. Between those months the number of keyword searches Veolia bought for the top spot on Google searches related to the Flint water crisis increased 219% according to data compiled by SEMRush and SpyFu another third-party digital marketing website.

SEMRush and SpyFu provide digital advertising data recorded from real-time Google search result pages for hundreds of millions of keywords offering more than a decade's worth of archived search result pages and copies of advertisements to review. While the sites only provide data on crawled keywords they provide snapshots of trends.

While Google itself provides data about how often keywords are searched the site does not provide historical data on what advertisements appeared on its results pages. Google also maintains a library of current advertisements placed by a company but does not maintain a public archive of past search result pages or old advertisements. As of Thursday Veolia had at least two Flint-related ads placed with Google: ""Veolia wrongly blamed"" and ""Veolia offered Flint help.""

Archived links to a page on the Veolia Flint Facts website show by last September the company also started employing a form of digital advertising known as dynamic search ads. That allows Google to tailor a company’s advertisements to the content contained on a website. After a company elects to employ this kind of advertising campaign Google monitors information on a specific website and alters the advertisements automatically based on the content a company itself inputs on its site. The ads are generated by Google through an automated process but it’s an option that must first be selected by the company itself.

Veolia confirmed it used dynamic search advertising for its Google ad campaigns and reiterated the company had not changed its ads since 2016. According to the company the difference in advertising headlines and copy is the result of Google’s algorithm.

“As mentioned before the ads have not been changed by VNA since they were initially launched” said Cooper Wright in an email noting the company has employed multiple ad groups broken out into different titles and descriptions.

While the website has been edited in the six years since it was launched the company said the homepage continues to serve as the official URL for the website’s ads.

“With dynamic ads (which are standard) Google automatically matches a URL page that is relevant to a search term the user is searching” she said. “Again this happens on the Google side based on their algorithm of information they have on the user who is searching.”

What was seen

While Cooper Wright said the company has not edited its advertisements since launching VeoliaFlintFacts.com in 2016 internal communications advertising analytics and archives of the website itself indicate an evolution of language.

The Veolia Flint Facts website launched in June 2016 within days of then-Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette filing suit against the company on the state’s behalf. The first advertisements visible in historical archives show the company’s advertising activity began in July of that year. The records show initial advertisements appeared for search results for terms like “city of flint water bill"" with headlines that included “Veolia in Flint” with a description below that read: “Get the facts about Veolia in Flint.” The other headline said “Veolia Wrongly Blamed” with a description that read “Expert advice disregarded.""

In December 2019 one of the search terms that ads appeared on was “flint michigan water lawsuit” with the headline “Veolia offered Flint help” and below that a description that read: “Support and advice ignored - Read the facts here.” Another ad appeared on the search term “flint water lawsuit” with the summary “Never hired to test for lead - expert advice disregarded.” Both versions of the ads directed people to VeoliaFlintFacts.com.

In December 2019 the company also updated its website to include a post responding to an article published by the Flint Journal and the Guardian that revealed internal communications from early 2015 between Veolia executives regarding concerns about lead problems in Flint. Within weeks a direct link to the Veolia Flint Facts post about the article began appearing at the bottom of the website’s Google search ads according to archived search results pages from January 2020.

After the civil trial started in February the content on the website shifted toward a focus on providing details about day-to-day developments at the trial with posts focused on discrediting or promoting certain witness testimonies as well as posts focused specifically on elements of the case that were essential to jury deliberations.

Through its spokeswoman Veolia denied geographically targeting its Google search ads at the state or metro level but it did not respond to questions about whether the company — or another vendor operating on behalf of the company — had geotargeted at the ZIP code level a common form of location-based targeting that allows advertisers to zero in on a more specific area. Google allows companies to target hundreds of ZIP codes at the same time. Veolia also did not respond when asked whether any of its advertisements had used radius targeting also referred to as geofencing a standard form of location targeting that serves advertisements to someone in a specific area using their real-time location.

Veolia's role in Flint

Veolia's ad buys were part of a years-long public relations campaign aimed at promoting the crux of the company’s defense in the case: that the blame for the Flint water crisis rests solely on the shoulders of the government officials who oversaw and covered up the botched water supply switch; not with the corporations staffed with water treatment professionals who were hired to provide guidance about Flint's water quality problems.

Veolia was contracted by the city of Flint in early 2015 to help Flint address the water quality problems it was dealing with in the aftermath of the switch to the river. By that point in the crisis Flint residents were packing city council meetings and holding jugs of brown water demanding answers about the safety of their drinking water.

The company’s executives recognized the potential corrosion and lead problems and discussed the issues internally. They also privately stated that it was in the city’s best interests to switch back to the Detroit water supply according to email evidence presented at trial. In its final report to the city however Veolia did not make any formal recommendation related to lead or reconnecting to Detroit. The company also did not alert the public to its concerns and instead told residents that the water met safety standards.

Veolia has argued it was not provided with sufficient data from city officials to conclude that lead was a problem despite the pronouncements that were made about it in internal emails. At the time the city of Flint was recording incorrect data and submitting inaccurate reports to state environmental regulators.

While public attention has often focused on what role government officials — including former Gov. Rick Snyder his cabinet members state environmental regulators and the slate of emergency managers and city officials — played in the water crisis the involvement of private contractors and consultants has attracted less attention.

The trial against Veolia stemmed from individual lawsuits brought by four children who lived in Flint during the city’s contaminated water crisis in 2014-15. The lawsuit accuses Veolia and another engineering firm Lockwood Andrews & Newnam of contributing to the manmade disaster.

Plaintiffs Emir Sherrod Andrea Teed and Daylanna Ware were 3 4 and 5 years old respectively when the water crisis began after Flint. The fourth plaintiff Riley Vanderhagen was less than a year old and still drinking baby formula.

“There is a puzzle of liability that exists in this case and it's going to be your job to put all of the pieces together” Stern the plaintiffs’ attorney told the jury during opening statements. “We are not here to tell you that all of the puzzle pieces consist of LAN and VNA. But we're here to tell you that plenty of them do.”

Influential or informative?

The use of digital advertising highlights the challenges judges face in keeping jurors away from messaging outside of the courthouse that rests in the palm of their hands at home legal experts said.

“That to me is very clear circumstantial evidence that they’re trying to influence the outcome of the trial. It’s not like the Flint water crisis started in November 2021” said Megan La Belle a law professor and co-director of the Law and Technology Institute at Catholic University's Columbus School of Law.

Over the winter when potential jurors were asked to come into the courthouse to fill out a questionnaire to help the lawyers narrow down the jury pool Veolia’s advertisements could be seen at the top of search results for such search terms as “flint michigan water crisis” with headlines of “The Truth Behind the Flint water crisis” and “Flint Facts: Timeline of Veolia's Flint Michigan Study.”

On Feb. 28 when Veolia and LAN's bellwether trial got underway at the federal courthouse on Liberty Street in downtown Ann Arbor U.S. District Court Judge Judith Levy instructed the jury ""not use electronic means to investigate or communicate about the case because it’s important that you decide the case based solely on the evidence here in the courtroom.""

“Information on the internet or available through social media could be wrong incomplete or not legally relevant to our case"" the judge said.

Around the time the jurors were being instructed not to do any outside research on the case and not to interact with the attorneys or other parties involved Veolia had redesigned the Veolia Flint Facts site and publicly started pushing the material on a new Twitter account called @VNAFlintFacts. It also continued to buy search ads in Michigan that continued driving Flint water-related search traffic to the website.

The expansion of the company's public relations efforts drew concern from the plaintiffs’ counsel early in the trial. In the spring the plaintiffs' attorneys sought to get information from Veolia regarding the Twitter handle.

“It appears that the Twitter handle ... is being used through an apparent coordinated effort by VNA to live tweet trial updates from the courtroom and misinform or influence the public concerning the trial” attorneys for the plaintiffs wrote in a motion filed in May seeking to compel the defendants to produce related documents.

In a court hearing about the issue Veolia’s lawyers said the “request infringed on the First Amendment rights of numerous parties” the Flint Journal reported. The defense attorneys said they were not involved in Veolia’s social media account but had provided the transcripts that were used by the company’s public relations department to write the posts about the trial.

Levy denied the plaintiffs' motion to compel in July saying the information sought was not relevant to the claims or defenses in the ongoing trial.

Jonathan Pollard a Florida-based attorney specializing in competition law who has advocated for lawyers to engage in proactive public relations strategies involving their cases said it’s problematic for companies to make major advertising buys during a trial.

“If a company has ratcheted its public relations efforts during the trial that raises some significant ethical concerns” Pollard said.

According to Northwestern University marketing professor Kelly Cutler the data indicates that the advertising strategy was “very effective” at getting ads in front of people. The frequency of the advertisements and the information included in the ads themselves also helped to spread the company’s message regardless of whether someone actually clicked on the link Cutler said.

“They're getting their point across without having to force people to click through” she said. “This website is a landing page for this Google ads campaign.”

Historically corporate defendants have found success in defending their litigation public relations campaigns by citing First Amendment protections or a need to defend their company's reputation to the public.

“I doubt the judge can say you’re forbidden from having that website” said Richard Marcus a law professor at the University of California Hastings explaining it would also likely be problematic for “the judge to say you’re not allowed to make public statements.”

“I think (the website) is materially different from bribery or threatening to break your leg or a lot of other things that might be considered jury tampering. That’s jury influencing” said Marcus who serves on the civil rules advisory committee for the Judicial Conference the body that sets policies for the federal court system.

One example where a party’s actions were deemed problematic occurred in 2002 in Colorado. Plaintiffs in a case against Walmart took out local television advertisements promoting their case. As a result of the ads a judge granted Walmart a change of venue to a different jurisdiction.

In another instance involving a lawsuit against Bayer about health problems allegedly caused by a cholesterol drug the pharmaceutical company’s public relations staff mailed letters to thousands of residents promoting the company’s “tremendous contributions” to global health and urging potential jurors to “keep an open mind.” Upon learning about the letters the judge in the case called for an investigation according to a New York Times report at the time. The local district attorney’s office ultimately declined to charge the company with jury tampering.

As the plaintiffs’ attorneys prepare for a retrial of the Flint water case the new insight into Veolia’s public relations strategy exposes what experts say is a glaring but overlooked potential threat to the legal system that has the capacity to jeopardize the impartiality of jury pools.

“It’s something that I think companies are doing that is flying under the radar because they can sort of mask it. … It’s easy to skirt the issue” La Belle said. “If there’s going to be a second trial this issue becomes incredibly important.""

Shot & Edited by: Jake Zengerling of Trojan Media Productions.

(St. Leon Ind.) - The East Central Natatorium was on display to the public on Thursday evening.

An open house and dedication ceremony gave many area residents their first look at the beautiful new facility at East Central High School. The natatorium is part of a $54 million dollar buildings project throughout the entire school corporation.

The 499 seat natatorium will be used for swim meets PE classes swim lessons and swim club. Plans are also in the works to allow public use however logistics with lifeguards and other safety measures have not been determined at this time. Superintendent Andrew Jackson tells Eagle Country 99.3 that senior citizen classes are also possible in the future.

When the plan for the natatorium came about the hope was that East Central would be the host site for regional swim competitions. That will come to fruition this winter when East Central plays host to the boys swim sectional. Jackson says East Central will host swim sectionals on a rotational basis every other year.

The first high school swim meet in the natatorium is scheduled for November 17 when Lady Trojan swimmers take to the pool.

The existing high school pool is being renovated into a multi-purpose physical education and fitness center for the middle school.

As part of the renovation the special education room will double in size and a kitchen lab will be added for life skill lessons. Other areas of concentration include the agriculture room and choir and band rooms. Plus restrooms will receive new finishes and fixtures between the cafeteria and the gym.

All work is expected to be completed over the next 12 months.

Next summer North Dearborn and Sunman schools will see improvements completed in their office areas.

The transaction Continental Finance Credit Card ABS Master Trust Series 2022-A is the company's sixth term asset-backed securities (ABS) deal and the fifth from the master trust. A portfolio of revolving general-purpose credit card accounts will collateralize the deal called the CFCCMT Series 2022-A according to Kroll Bond Rating Agency.

The Bank of Missouri and Celtic Bank Corporation originated the accounts which operate under the Mastercard brand. More than one million accounts are in the transaction which have an average balance of $648 and an interest rate of 27.9%.

On a weighted average (WA) basis the collateral is aged 19 months and has a non-zero WA Vantage Score of 600. As of June 30 credit card accounts in the CFCC Master Trust have a non-zero WA Vantage Score of 600 which is actually lower than the Vantage Score of 602 among accounts at the Continental Finance company level. KBRA also noted that the accounts have an annual income of $52372 on a WA basis.

KBRA noted some mixed credit benefits to the notes based on Continental Credit's internal credit scoring. The company has used proprietary credit scoring since 2009 and implemented a new model in 2016 its M6. That credit-scoring method used actual defaults and delinquencies experienced in its managed credit card portfolio. The managed portfolio has performed well but with data going back only to 2016 the data series is limited.

Account holders in the master trust show other signs of non-prime credit. Outstanding balances have grown 81% over the last twelve months according to KBRA. Balances in the trust have disproportionately WA high balances $648 in relation to their available credit lines $947.

The transaction will include a three-year revolving period where no principal payments will be made on the notes before the Amortization Date unless an early amortization event occurs.

The trust will issue four classes of notes according to KBRA which will benefit from initial credit enhancement levels of 44.5% on the $129.5 million class A notes to 10.0% on the class D notes.

As for ratings KBRA expects to assign 'AA-' on the class A; an 'A-' rating on the $30 million class C notes; 'BBB-' on the $30.9 class C notes and 'BB' on the class D notes.

To overcome these hassles banks in India offer Non-Resident External (NRE) Account and Non-Resident Ordinary (NRO) Account. These bank accounts can be opened by NRIs Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) and Overseas Citizens of India (OCI).

Why do we have NRE and NRO accounts?

Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad

As per the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) guidelines an NRI cannot have a local savings account in his or her name in India. You must convert all your savings (money earned abroad) into an NRE or NRO account. “Continuing to use the local savings account in India can attract hefty penalties. You need to inform your bank in case travelling abroad for an indefinite period to convert a savings account to NRE or NRO account as per usage” says Chandrakanth Bhat Founder NRI Money Clinic.

Opening an NRE or NRO account helps NRIs in multiple ways. For instance you can transfer your foreign earnings to India in case you have family over here who is dependent on you. Also income from India through any investments can be retained here.

What is a Non-Resident Ordinary Rupee (NRO) Account?

NRO accounts help you manage Indian rupee income sources like rent dividends or any other income such as profits that come to you by a sale of property or investments here in India. It could be a saving account or a fixed deposit account. Here both non-resident and resident Indians can be joint account holders. The account also allows you to receive income from foreign currency converted to Indian rupees and in Indian rupees as well. The money lies in Indian rupees in the NRO account.

“The NRO account can be debited for the purpose of local payments transfers to other NRO accounts or remittance of current income abroad” says Kartik Jain Head - Product & Platforms Consumer Banking Group at DBS Bank India.

However NRIs should give prominence to NRE accounts to remit income abroad because repatriation of money in NRE accounts doesn’t require any permission and has no limits. The NRO account has a restriction of repatriating not more than 1 million US dollars per financial year inclusive of taxes. You also need to submit form 15CA/CB which is a chartered accountant’s certificate confirming the tax payments as due.

“Any gift in rupees or a loan by a resident Indian to an NRI within the remittance limits prescribed can be credited to the NRO account” says Virat Diwanji Group President and Head – Consumer Bank and Member Group Management Council Kotak Mahindra Bank.

There are certain drawbacks to holding NRO accounts. The interest you earn in the NRO account is subject to tax deducted at source (TDS) whereas interest earned on NRE accounts is tax-free.

You can also link your NRO account to make investments in India.

What is an NRE Account?

The NRE account is an Indian rupee-denominated account. It could be savings Foreign Currency Non-Resident Account (FCNR) and a fixed deposit account. You can deposit your earnings from overseas or transfer funds from one NRE to another NRE account and in certain cases from NRO to NRE account along with form 15CA/CB. The foreign currency deposited into the NRE account gets converted into Indian rupees.

An NRE account comes with many benefits. Bhat says “Most important benefit is the principal and interest income are fully repatriable that means you can move it out of India as per your will and you don't need anyone's permission to repatriate this money.” He adds that interest income on deposits earned in an NRE account is tax-free. You can also link your NRE account to make investments in India.

How do I transfer the amount from an overseas bank account to my NRE or NRO accounts in India?

From an overseas bank account in developed countries like the US the UK and Canada you can do a SWIFT transfer into the NRE or NRO account you hold. Whereas Gulf countries like Kuwait Oman Qatar Saudi Arabia and UAE also rely on exchange houses besides SWIFT to remit funds to your NRE or NRO accounts. SWIFT is a messaging network banks use for quick money transfer instructions. “You need to give justifications to your overseas bank for moving the money to India” says Diwanji.

“Documents required depend on the purpose of remittance and charges are based on type and amount of transfer” adds Satheesh Krishnamurthy - EVP & Head – Private Premium Banking & Third-Party Products Axis Bank. For instance money sent as family maintenance typically requires no documents whereas for equity investments certain declarations may be required.

There are no charges by the banks for inward remittances in India. But the overseas bank will charge you for this transfer through SWIFT. NRIs can also deposit foreign currency brought to India during their visit to NRE accounts.

As an NRI can I transfer funds from my NRO account to NRE account?

The ideal way to remit funds is through an NRE account which is fully repatriable. Yes you can also transfer money from your NRO account to NRE account. “It is a legitimate route that an NRI can move money to the home country” says Diwanji.

There are multiple reasons to transfer money to an NRE account. You might need to transfer your income in Indian currency and withdraw to meet investments and expenses in your preferred currency abroad. You might want to keep an NRO account only for collecting the Indian income and manage all investments in an NRE account that allows you the flexibility of full repatriation when you need the funds. “You need to submit the request along with Form 15CA/CB” adds Krishnamurthy. The USD 1 million per year limit applies for NRO to NRE transfers too.

Choosing between NRE and NRO account for your investments

“By nature NRE account is suitable as the amount lying unutilised in your NRE savings account earns interest which is tax-free and if savings are placed in a fixed deposit then NRE FD interest is also tax-free” says Kalpesh Ashar Founder Full Circle Financial Planners and Advisors. Additionally if the investments are done in capital markets the repatriation back to a foreign country is easy without any permission through NRE account rather than NRO account.

Which is the best bank for opening NRE/NRO accounts?

Jain suggests that banks with good digital systems and online presence should be chosen over those that are weak on such issues. “As an NRI customer you spend most of the time overseas. Digital accessibility of your account is therefore important” says Jain. Check a bank’s ease of account opening and operations.

Further in India the bank should offer you a relationship manager and a branch should be located in your vicinity for various services.

“While evaluating you should look for banks that offer a full suite of digital options in order to take care of remittances within and outside India bill payments debit/credit card facilities loans insurance investments etc” says Krishnamurthy.

As you are depositing your finances in these accounts also look for security and fraud protection from banks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlbmVmaXRzY2FuYWRhLmNvbS9iZW5lZml0cy9oZWFsdGgtYmVuZWZpdHMvYWdhLWJlbmVmaXQtc29sdXRpb25zLWFjcXVpcmluZy1hcHR1cy1iZW5lZml0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AGA Benefit Solutions acquiring Aptus Benefits,"AGA Benefit Solutions is acquiring Vancouver-based Aptus Benefits Inc. a group benefits and retirement consultancy with expertise in collectively bargained plans and executive disability programs.

Procter & Gamble’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+9.9% vs. +8.3%). The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix along with strength across segments.



Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.



However the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues higher SG&A costs higher transportation costs and rising inflation. Its significant international presence exposes it to foreign currency risks which acts as a headwind.

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.

Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year. The strong performance is likely to continue in 2024 on the back of continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume coupled with strong Ion procedure growth.



ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

Industrial Networks (INet) provides a range of rail yard automation and data acquisition systems for manufacturing and shipping operations rail shippers Class Is and short lines. Combining mobile devices and stationary readers INet can find “a solution for automating the collection of data in any environment” company officials said in an email.

The INetShipper division provides automation and data acquisition systems to shippers. Since 2005 Bourque Logistics and Industrial Networks have partnered to implement the YardMaster Solution. Using stationary and mobile automatic equipment identification (AEI) readers coupled with shipping operations software that automates load/offload inventory and inspection processes the YardMaster solution is designed to increase overall productivity and improve safety in more than 300 plants in North America Industrial Networks officials said.

Meanwhile INetRail provides data-collection yard management solutions for short lines and Class Is rail-car repair shops and car service providers. A combination of AEI hardware software applications and the new INet Gateway database collect and manage data in a centralized location. INetRail technology includes both stationary and mobile AEI readers as well as software with inspection forms photos and an interactive mapping screen.

Progress Rail

The Nitro suite of decision-support system software from Progress Rail uses a combination of artificial intelligence and modern software engineering to help significantly reduce delays — saving time and money while improving rail network efficiencies company officials said.

NitroYard is designed to plan and optimize yard movements including train arrivals scout locomotives loading and unloading and train formation. It can be integrated with other railroad systems. Benefits include up to a 10% reduction of car cycle time at a yard and improved on-time delivery officials from Progress Rail — which is owned by Caterpillar Inc. — said.

In addition when NitroYard is coupled with the Nitro Movement Planner railroads can achieve up to a 13% average velocity increase up to a 30% reduction in meeting and pass time and up to 95% planning acceptance automation they said.

Siemens Mobility Inc.

Siemens Mobility Inc.

The design of hump profiles and the control of headway and coupling speeds in hump yards are difficult because freight cars have different characteristics and rolling resistances Siemens Mobility Inc. officials said. Faster-rolling cars tend to overtake slower-rolling ones and the imprecision in predicting the rollability of individual cars on classification tracks makes achieving a desirable coupling speed more difficult they added.

The space in the tracks between the clearance or safe area to where the cars rest is referred to as the distance to couple. By using the Siemens Mobility Distance to Couple product the retarders maintain sufficient headway (a minimum of one to two seconds) between cars to allow automated yard-control systems to throw the switches safely company officials said. The retarders are also used to control the coupling or impact speeds of cars on the classification tracks within specified speed limits of 1 mph to 6 mph.

The Siemens Mobility Distance to Couple product line features a real-time track circuit that reads the space left in the track for incoming cars. The messages are sent back to the control system so it can calculate the speed to allow cars into each track to achieve desired coupling speed. Customers see more accurate distances than the typical estimated distance acquired by wheel detectors and passive circuits Siemens Mobility officials said.

TekTracking

TekTracking

TekTracking’s Commander Terminal Automation system was developed based on the guiding principles of understanding customers’ pain points company officials said.

To provide modern reliable and scalable yard control technology the company developed a 100% IP-based system using robust commercially available ethernet communications and controllers. Diagnostic tools are built directly into the system TekTracking officials said.

The company’s “plug-and-play” capability allows for the incorporation of additional equipment including mobile devices PC-based touchscreen displays and video cameras. The Commander Terminal Automation system also gives control back to the railroad by enabling local and remote troubleshooting and problem solving TekTracking officials said.

Trainyard Tech LLC

Trainyard Tech LLC

The Trainyard Tech LLC ClassMaster™ Hump Yard Process Control System is designed to use a set of control algorithms to provide the highest possible throughput with the lowest number of misrouted cars. The system offers safer handling of free-rolling freight company officials said.

The software has been used to process more than 100 million individual rail cars in 22 North American classification yards according to Trainyard Tech. Systems are delivered with off-the-shelf hardware components and provide uninterrupted 24/7 operations.

For use in short-line and flat-yard operations the company offers the RouteMaster™ NX Process Control System which features the same technologies used in the ClassMaster system. A scalable system RouteMaster includes radio controller boxes for individual switches.

Not by city officials but by the contractor working for scooter company Bird.

The Gazette Xtra in Beloit reports the paving operator nixed the agreement with Bird after one year arguing the California scooter company was not responsive to problems and made ""progressive"" cuts to his pay agreement.

The contractor Nick Yoss said he was not sure if Bird would relaunch the program in Beloit. Yoss said he returned all of the company's scooters erased his account with the company and severed his relationship as an ""independent fleet manager.""

Bird has a similar program in nearby Janesville where they are three weeks into a three-month pilot progam. But the Gazette Xtra reports businesses have been complaining over a ridership they say is mostly underage.

Yoss adds to the newspaper that some of the same Janesville problems played out in the Bird program in Beloit including pressures on business relationships.

Meanwhile in Milwaukee the city appears to have embraced the concept of rentable electric scooters. Brew City's pilot program existed in spurts in the recent past and is back once again.

The 2022-23 pilot allows for a maximum of 1800 scooters citywide and for a broader dispersal of scooters meaning fewer scooters downtown. The city of Milwaukee says the maximum speed for dockless scooters is 15 miles per hour and riding on the sidewalk and the Riverwalk is prohibited.

Milwaukee signed on with the companies Lime Spin and Veo for the electric scooters. According to the Lime app pricing starts at $1 per ride plus $0.34 per minute. An all-you-can-ride pass is $11.99 for one hour or $19.99 for 24 hours the app states.

A preview of Sword Art Online -Progressive- Scherzo of Deep Night‘s theme song “Shinzou” by Eir Aoi can now be heard in a new theme song trailer which also features some of the action from the upcoming film.

Sword Art Online Progressive: Scherzo of Deep Night is set to premiere in Japan on October 22. It was originally meant to release on September 10.

Sword Art Online -Progressive- Scherzo of Deep Night is a sequel to Sword Art Online -Progressive- Aria of a Starless Night which premiered in Japan on October 30 2021. The films are based on the Sword Art Online Progressive spin-off light novel series that expands on the “Aincrad arc” of the original and still ongoing Sword Art Online series. Scherzo of Deep Night is the title of the story in Sword Art Online Progressive‘s fourth volume.

Yen Press describes the volume as:

It’s been just two months since they were trapped in the game of death that is Sword Art Online and Kirito and Asuna continue their struggle at the vanguard of progress through the game. The fifth floor of Aincrad is a mazelike ruin and the two dare to take pleasure in raiding it for the treasure it contains. Upon returning to the fourth floor it’s time to do some questing on behalf of the Elf Lord Yofilis–but here begins Asuna’s discontent for in doing so they will have to face her least favorite monster ever…

The returning staff from Aria of a Starless Night includes Ayako Kounou as director Kento Toya as character designer and chief animation director Yasuyuki Kai as action director and monster designer Aya Akizuki and Keisuke Watanabe as sub-character designers and Yuki Kajiura as music composer.

What makes a facility effective is what is built inside those four walls. In 2022 that means building facilities with the future in mind yet one capable of leveraging robotics and business intelligence today.

The warehouse is no longer just a dumb box.

With estimates of just between 5% and 10% of all global warehouses having some form of automation and the need to improve efficiency especially in e-commerce warehouse operations the opportunity ahead is massive for warehouse operators. But warehouses that are not capable of handling sustainability programs electric vehicles or any of the modern technologies that generate reams of data sets are no longer considered the future.

Whether it is robots EVs solar panels or some other technology that data collection and analysis is now vital to running an efficient warehouse.

Turning data into business decisions

Jason Lum sales executive for Locus Robotics told an audience at the recent Home Delivery World at the Pennsylvania Convention Center that Locus is turning data sets in the warehouse into actionable information.

“How do we make the associates in the warehouse more efficient?” he asked the audience before explaining how the desire to get packages delivered in one day has driven the need for more information and efficiency.

“You need to drive that information layer” Lum said. “When you think about robotics it’s about [adding] that layer of BI (business intelligence).”

While Locus is known primarily as a warehouse robotics company Lum said it is really a solutions provider. That includes a robust dashboard and reporting system designed to provide the insights warehouse operators need to manage employees and robots in a cohesive manner.





“My job is to make sure everyone in the world has the data in front of them” Lum noted.

On-the-fly adjustments

Saying that the ultimate goal is to improve line per hour and unit per hour performance Lum pointed to the opportunity BI affords — from gamification of the workforce to strategically adjusting staffing/robotic placement on the fly.

Among the data Locus’ system can collect are metrics on worker performance (hourly weekly and monthly); inventory flow; labor bot and picking balance management with heat maps; and a 360-degree view of the entire warehouse operation.

That information though needs to flow to more than just the CEO Lum said pointing to images on the screen of warehouses that provided dashboards on large viewing screens placed strategically throughout warehouses. The data he said “is for the guy on the ground.”

Trending information may be important for executives but a floor manager needs to know if one area of the warehouse is behind on its picking goals.

“That’s where the BI tools [shine]. I get to see the information quickly” Lum said. “Our goal is to ensure that every piece of information … you can slice and dice. Do you want to see employee pick rates? We can do that.”

Robots need some help

While business intelligence is helpful in managing the warehouse that BI — and the rapidly accelerating use of robotics — doesn’t happen if the architects of modern warehouses are not taking into consideration the design elements needed for robotics electric vehicles and even drones.

Commercial real estate firm Prologis represents more than 5800 global customers and has been focused on ensuring its facilities are prepped for the future even if that future is now today.





“Chances are if you have a package on your doorstep today there is a chance it came through one of our facilities” Todd Lewis vice president of Prologis Ventures said in a separate address at Home Delivery World.

Lewis noted that Prologis is the largest solar company in the world although just 5% of its facilities currently have rooftop solar panels. But Prologis’ efforts go far beyond building sustainable energy initiatives into its buildings.

“What type of transportation is going to arrive at our facilities tomorrow?” Lewis asked. “We need to work on that today.

“We’re trying to invest [in] technology that can help our clients stay in the facilities they are in today” he added.

Warehouse robotics CEO: ‘I don’t think there is a ceiling’ Keep reading

Lewis pointed to some of the data collection efforts that take place. In California for instance Prologis has installed scanners at entrances to record all truck traffic entering the facility to meet California’s “indirect reporting rule.” That rule requires documentation of all trucks to enter as well as type and other identifying information. The technology automates a process that could be time-consuming and expensive to do manually.

Robots attract clients

Turning to robotics Lewis called out Locus’ technologies as keys to not only helping speed picking processes and reduce costs but also for helping facilities attract new tenants.

“[Robots help real estate] so that when you move in the facility is ready for the technology” he said also noting electric vehicle access as another example. Prologis has an EV business that helps its clients prepare for large-scale deployments at facilities. This includes charging infrastructure and other considerations.

And all of these things generate data which ties back into business intelligence. Real-time access to information allows managers to quickly shift staff or bots to achieve goals Lum said. This includes tapping into data from order systems.

“If I can see my open orders then I can flood my associates and robots into these areas” he added. “I’m Tom Brady out there making audibles all the time. If I know a blitz is coming I can make a change.”

Locus also provides low energy Bluetooth tags for employees that connect to the system allowing for the gamification of operations. In the end though the use of BI is about managing the entire warehouse operation not just the robots.

“I’m going to look at priority picks priority orders so I can adjust my staff. That’s what BI is all about” Lum concluded.

India is now one of the four growth markets identified by the insurer says group CEO Mark FitzPatrick ...Why have you not hiked stake in the life insurance joint venture ICICI Prudential from 22% despite the headroom being available to go up to 74%? Are you likely to look outside this JV for opportunities?We love the fact that there is now an option for us to be able to increase our stake.We are getting closer to understanding better the market the regulatory environment and how we can support and grow the business faster. We have identified India as one of the four growth markets besides Indonesia China and Thailand. We will look at this without making any commitment at this stage.For us to start anything new from scratch when we have such a powerful business here would be a far more complex execution. We have a business that is a fantastic brand and an excellent management team and to walk away from a business that has all that and start something that has none of those things makes no commercial sense. We are going to continue to work closely with ICICI Bank.How does the global increase in rates impact life insurers ?An increase in interest rates is positive for insurance companies as it allows them to offer products with a high rate of return and a broader range of products. The transition from lower rates to higher is painful. As one settles down to higher rates the guarantees we can offer consumers are much more attractive. In Europe where rates have been low or negative it has been difficult for insurance companies to develop products that provide a meaningful guaranteed return.The new insurance regulator has proposed major changes...Having that vision and aspiration I think will shake up the whole industry and get people looking at things differently. If you approach things incrementally it will take so long to achieve. If you create a very lofty vision you encourage people to be more innovative in what they do and you accelerate the pace of change. The vision of ensuring that by 2047 every Indian has access to some element of protection is a fantastic vision. We really applaud that aspiration and look forward to supporting it.What regulatory changes would prompt you to invest more?We understand that the industry here is likely to move towards a risk-based capital regime in future. We have seen many markets worldwide move toward a risk-based capital regime. In Europe Singapore China and Hong Kong — we see an uplift in our capital because we manage our business in a very conservative fashion. If it comes in it will free up more capital for insurers who write quality business.There is debate over allowing life insurers to sell health indemnity. Would you be interested in health?We would absolutely welcome the opportunity to do that. There is more than enough opportunity and the market is big enough to be opened to life insurers. Life insurers understand underwriting and can do this business sensibly and responsibly and get greater coverage through agency and banking networks. In other markets we operate in Singapore and Hong Kong we offer that kind of product and we can bring that expertise to Kannan (NS Kannan CEO of ICICI Pru Life) and his team.Will hike stake in ICICI Pru Asset Management?The business is doing fantastically well and there is no intention to change anything. One of the things that we look at from the regulatory side is digital identification — the element that can expedite the onboarding of customers. There is a real potential to operate in a slightly different way than the way it is operating today. At the moment they still need to do their KYC and with the digital ID there is an opportunity to streamline it further.Do you see India servicing Asian operations?Some of our best talent has come from the ICICI Pru stable. We have created an operation in Bengaluru to access some of the best talents in the digital space to help us with coding and our digital architecture. There is a lot of digital transformation taking place in insurance and in the asset management space. We have to be alive to what’s happening in the market and how the digital competitors are trying to operate. We have accelerated our digital strategy through Covid and Covid probably accelerated the uptake of digital capability by five plus years.What was the reason for the demerger of the Asian business?We have invested over $11 billion in Asia over the last 10-11 years. At the same time our investments in Europe and America were minimal as the return in Asia was a multiple of what we could get from the UK or the US. We decided to create a UK-European business where investors could look for dividend income and a yield play. The expectation from an Asia-focused company is growth. For every dollar of new business investment in Asia we make about $4 of new business profit and we can’t see that multiple anywhere else. So we decided to create a pure-play growth organisation.Why are so many Asian insurers trading at a discount to embedded value despite growth?ICICI Prudential trades at a multiple of its embedded value likewise HDFC Life. So quality business trades at a multiple of embedded value. What I think you are seeing in some markets for example in China is a major structural change from a very large agency-led industry with 12 million agents to about four million agents and there is a big push by the regulator toward high-quality agents. We have outperformed in China because we had a philosophy of a professional agency force. You are seeing an adjustment in values because some of the market expected the big local players to continue as they were. The regulatory environment has changed and we are seeing an adjustment.Do you see agency as a channel growing?Agency will continue to be important in the future because a lot of education and explanation is required as some of the products are complex. When things start to get difficult an agent is valuable to remind people of the benefits of their policy and therefore protecting the persistency of our business. We generally see margins of agency business being higher than bancassurance as agents tend to sell more protection and through a bank it tends to be more savings related.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vY2lsaXNvcy5teS9wcnVkZW50aWFsLWluc3VyYW5jZS13aWxsaWEtd2FsbGFjZS1mcmVkLXNhd3llci10aXRhbmljL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Unsolved murder. Titanic. Prudential Insurance's unexpectedly rich history,"This article is NOT selling you insurance – it’s part of our series on the history of familiar brands in Malaysia that we found interesting but nobody wanted to pay us to write; like this one about Panasonic’s unexpectedly close relationship with Malaysia.

Prudential Insurance has been around since 1848 so any company that’s been around this long would have some pretty interesting historical tidbits – in fact they actually maintain an entire archive of it. So let’s start off with how this writer always thought Prudential’s logo was a farmer or warrior holding a sickle. Padahal…

Prudential’s logo and name is based on a Greek lady (kinda)

Without going too much into it Prudence is considered the mother of all virtues because it basically refers to the foresight to make wise choices while avoiding risk and is personified as Prudentia; a woman with a snake and mirror. And just like Starbucks siren Prudential’s logos before the 1980’s was wayyyyy closer to that original description before being redesigned to this cleaner modern form in 1986. But actually kan the snake and mirror have always been there:

There are 2 things that you need to know about insurance back in the day. The first is that it was mainly for rich people and businesses and the second is that having long company names was a requirement (citation needed). Prudential was founded in 1848 by a group of bearded Victorian men as “The Prudential Mutual Assurance Investment and Loan Association” with the goal of providing insurance and loans to the middle classes. Later though they made a (at the time) super brave step to offer the same services to the working classes – creating a system of using agents who went from door-to-door selling and collecting premiums and generally servicing clients.

Now if that sounds familiar then this next point is really gonna knock on your door ring on your bell and tap on your window too.

Prudential agents were super ✨ a e s t h e t i c ✨

If you got that knock on your door reference then you’ll also have heard the term “The Man from the Pru”. If not then ask your parents kids.

The Man from the Pru was coined in 1949 after Weekly Illustrated magazine (not to be confused with Sports Illustrated) published a photo of an actual Prudential agent named Fred Sawyer walking all cool and determined and stuff. While his face wasn’t always used that iconic stride was was a staple in advertising campaigns around the world including Malaysia.

Basically before iPads and computers Prudential agents had to carry around special company-issued briefcases. These contained the usual forms and leaflets but more interestingly also had a chain that could be strapped to the agents’ wrist to prevent loss or snatch thefts. Of course thieves weren’t after the latest medical coverage but the money that these briefcases contained because agents had to collect premiums by hand back in the day.

These briefcases coupled with a professional dress sense created a ‘uniform’ or aesthetic that came to define Prudential agents. In fact The Man from the Pru is so definitive that it’s still used in shows set during its long period of popularity like the super outdated Violet “What’s a weekend?” Crawley from Downton Abbey referring to a character’s fashion choice as “The man from the Prudential” or the original title of a Ricky Gervais movie set in the 1970’s.

Prudential covered 1/5 of the victims of the Titanic

Because Prudential is all about making insurance affordable for different classes of people they ended up covering 1/3 of the UK’s population by 1900. That plus being one of the main risk-sharers with the Atlantic Mutual Insurance company it’s probably not surprising that they ended up inadvertently covering the lives of 1/5 of the victims that went down with the Titanic.

Prudential ended up paying £14239 – or £1663230.26 in 2020 money – to the families of 324 people while putting up newspaper ads updating the public on how many payouts had been made throughout the entire saga.

A popular British unsolved crime involved a Prudential agent

If you’ve read books on unsolved crime you’d likely have read the case of William Herbert Wallace and R.M. Qualtrough in 1931.

If you haven’t the gist of the case is that William was a Prudential agent who was called by a prospective client named R.M. Qualtrough to meet at a different part of the city. After traveling there by tram he found that the meeting place didn’t exist. After some time asking around Herbert gave up and went home… only to find his wife murdered.

A long investigation ensued and William was eventually charged for her murder but later released. What made this case so enduring was that R.M. Qualtrough was never found (if he even existed) and William’s lack of emotion throughout the entire ordeal has been interpreted as guilt or simply the famous British stiff upper lip. Numerous attempts to recreate his journey were made to see if it could fit within the timeline given by him and other witnesses but until today the murder is officially unsolved with some theories pinning the crime on an ex-agent who was fired after William caught him embezzling from the company.

And yes there was a telemovie made about this case in 1990 called – wait for it – The Man from the Pru.

Final fact: There’s another (unrelated) American company called Prudential

If you’ve ever once thought of Prudential’s logo being an iceberg or a mountain you didn’t imagine it.

That’s actually the logo of Prudential Financial an American insurance provider that’s a completely different company. What makes this slightly more interesting is that the American Prudential’s origin story is also pretty similar except they were set up to sell burial insurance and their original name was The Widows and Orphans Friendly Society.

Yeah. We really weren’t kidding about long company names back in those days.

The measure is the first step in implementing an amendment to the Mining Law passed by the Mexican Congress in April 2022 (promulgated by Decree published in the Diario Oficial de la Federación on April 22 2022).3 The amendment declared lithium to be a strategic mineral and property of the Nation and as such of ""public utility."" The legal effect of this declaration is spelt out by the Law as follows:

The exploration mining exploitation refining and use of lithium are reserved in favor of the people of Mexico; and such activities will be carried out by a government agency;

No concessions licenses contracts permits or authorizations will be granted for those activities; and

The economic value chains of lithium will also be managed and controlled by such agency.

About the new state-owned company

LitioMx will be a decentralized public entity attached to the Secretariat of Energy and will coordinate with the Under-Secretariat of Panning and Energy Transition. The company’s main responsibilities will be as follows:

Preparation of medium and long-term strategic programs for the exploration mining exploitation refining and use of lithium and its economic value chains;

Development and execution of engineering projects research and all geological activities related to the exploration mining exploitation refining and use of lithium;

Research and development of the technology required by industry related to the use of lithium;

Location and recognition of the geological areas in which there are probable lithium reserves with the help of the Mexican Geological Service;

Generation of basic geological information on lithium located in the national territory with the support of the Mexican Geological Service;

Promotion of the sustainable use of lithium for the energy transition for the benefit of the population in general; and

Management and control of the activities necessary for the production transformation and distribution of lithium by-products for which it may involve other public and private entities.

What’s next?

According to the US Geological Services Mexico has the ninth largest identified lithium resources in the world (1.7 million tons).4 However there is currently no commercial mining exploitation of lithium in Mexico only some exploration projects in Jalisco Guanajuato Nogales Sonora and Puebla. The implementation of the new amendment to the Mining Law raises at least two issues:

How it will affect on-going private projects including the most advanced one in Sonora which is being carried out by a joint-venture between a British and Chinese consortium; and

To what extent private companies will be able to participate in the Mexican lithium market: the amendment to the Mining Law is clear that primary activities (e.g. exploration mining exploitation and refining) will be carried out by the new government agency but the Decree seems to open the door for LitioMx to partner with private companies in lithium by-product projects (e.g. manufacturing of batteries for EVs and personal electronics such as mobile phones and computers).5

State of lithium in Bolivia Chile and Argentina

Bolivia Chile and Argentina which together account for 55% of the world’s lithium reserves have followed different legal models. All treat lithium as property of the State; however Argentina is the only country which has not declared it as a ""strategic resource.""

In Bolivia (and now in Mexico) the State manages the production process through a public company. The State will only partner with private companies to add value once the resource is obtained. In contrast Chile and Argentina both allow private initiatives. Chile treats lithium like oil and gas and leases its exploitation for a certain period of time to private companies through a bidding system. The current leases will expire in 2030. In Argentina the provinces have original dominion over lithium and other natural resources existing within their territories. The provinces all manage their resources according to the federal Mining Code which allows mining activities by state-owned enterprises and private companies domestic or foreign. Exploration permits are granted perpetually subject to certain obligations for maintenance. However lithium resources are scarce and provincial state-owned companies already hold most of the exploration and mining exploitation rights. As a result newcomers (i.e. domestic or foreign state-owned or private companies) usually need to partner with those companies to set up large lithium projects. The provincial state-owned company keeps a minority state in the joint venture while the investor supplies the necessary funding and expertise for the project.

MILAN -Telecom Italia (TIM) is close to kicking off a process to sell a minority stake in its enterprise service arm two sources close to the matter said as CEO Pietro Labriola strives to revamp Italy's biggest phone group.

Labriola's turnaround plan for the debt-laden former phone monopoly centres around ceding control of its prized landline grid to state lender CDP while also breaking up the company into several units and luring new investors.

As it seeks to press ahead with its turnaround plan while valuation issues complicate the network's disposal TIM will shortly launch a beauty contest to select a partner for the so-called TIM Enterprise business unit the sources said.

The venture combines the phone group's connectivity services for big corporate clients and public administration as well as cloud cybersecurity and Internet of Things operations.

In March CVC made a non-binding proposal for a stake of up to 49% in the unit. The approach valued the venture at 6 billion euros ($5.98 billion) including debt a price tag deemed inadequate by TIM sources had previously said.

Other players besides CVC have expressed interest after the unit was presented at a capital markets day in July Labriola told analysts last month adding TIM would try to ""extract the maximum value from this area.""

In the meantime diverging views over the value of TIM's landline assets pitting TIM's top investor Vivendi against the group's second biggest investor CDP are complicating talks over the network disposal ahead of a national election on Sept. 25.

Vivendi has warned it would not back a sale of TIM's fixed network infrastructure for less than 31 billion euros a valuation criticised by CDP other sources have said.

The state lender is keen to create a single national network operator merging TIM's network assets with those of rival Open Fiber.

Vivendi which owns a 24% stake of TIM and whose support is key for any deal is ramping up pressures ahead of a board meeting on Sept. 29.

The French group has sent two letters to TIM's board to complain over a potential conflict of interest and CDP governance issues the same sources added.

Uncertainty over TIM network deal with CDP pushed the phone group shares to a fresh record low on Thursday.

You quit school and take your idea to Sand Hill Road where VCs shower you with cash. Your company grows quickly. You eventually get a valuation of over $1 billion and you go public to great fanfare.

That’s the mythology anyway but what if there were another way? What if you could grow a $1 billion company without the outside investment the crazy sales and marketing spend the pressure to grow ever faster?

Zoho a company that has a broad set of front- and back-end business software has defied that growth and investment stereotype to great success. Zoho reports that revenue last year exceeded $1 billion — although as a private entity it didn’t supply an exact number. Yet it has never taken so much as a penny of external investment.

By developing the company on its own terms Zoho has been able to build a strong internal culture steeped in R&D and product development growing slowly but steadily without having to deal with any investor interference whatsoever.

Zoho’s product catalog which exceeds 50 products covers everything from a traditional office suite to business intelligence finance sales and marketing customer service and too many other software categories to list here. Using a freemium model to drive usage it competes with giants like Salesforce Google Microsoft and Oracle yet has found a way to thrive in spite of such a harsh competitive landscape.

I spoke to founder and CEO Sridhar Vembu along with some industry experts to get a better sense of how Zoho has grown on its own terms and how this “little engine that could” keeps rolling along.

Why Zoho is different

Back in 2005 Zoho launched with Zoho Writer a product that caught the attention of TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington. Vembu said that Arrington’s article was the earliest coverage of the company. Since then Zoho has released dozens of products and he said the vision from the start was to slowly expand the set of applications.

“That was the plan from the beginning. We actually wanted to build a full suite. In other words when we started Zoho Writer we knew we’d be building a spreadsheet a presentation application [and all of that]” he said. “But we had a sequence. We knew we could not build it all at once.”

Laurie McCabe co-founder and partner at SMB Group a research and consultancy firm that focuses on technology geared toward small and medium businesses said Vembu’s vision is a big reason for the company’s success.

“Zoho has a very visionary founder with deep convictions that have put it on a very different path than its competitors” she told TechCrunch adding that on the product side Zoho provides “sophisticated yet easy-to-use and integrated software for lots of functions at a low price.”

Brent Leary founder and principal analyst at CRM Essentials who keeps a close eye on Zoho said that the company has taken its own unique route to success.

“Zoho’s ability to stay to true their core principles without being swayed by outside forces is why I think they’ve been able to be as successful as they have been” he said. “Not taking VC money or going public allowed the company to do things in a manner and time frame that didn’t erode the culture and heart of the company.”

From a numbers perspective Zoho has over 11000 employees spread out across the world working with a whopping 80 million users overall. More than 600000 businesses pay the company.

Early on Zoho concentrated exclusively on SMBs but it’s moved up to midmarket and even the enterprise in recent years.

“SMBs still drive the business” Vembu said “but now as the whole platform is maturing larger enterprises are coming to us. And so we have a very good midmarket to enterprise business that’s growing on top of the whole SMB business.”

While it offers free products that appeal to small business users who can test the product without paying the company can funnel these users into paying customers as they reach certain user-number thresholds or require more sophisticated features. Companies that want access to the whole Zoho product catalog can sign up for Zoho One or access certain app bundles around CRM finance human resources and so forth.

Vembu said that while the market is shifting SMBs remain key:

If you asked me five years ago SMBs would have been the vast majority of our business. Today a good 25% to 30% of our business is coming from the midmarket and enterprise. And that part is growing faster too so we are growing to be an enterprise company with a very strong SMB base.

Leary said the slow pace of change is consistent with the way Zoho operates more generally — not paying attention to how other tech companies operate.

“It may not be moving at the speed you typically see from most enterprise software vendors taking this path and Zoho may do things (or not do things) in a way that is very nontraditional as they move upstream but they have thought it out and have decided they’d prefer to do things that are more aligned with their culture than to stay true to any Silicon Valley [growth] playbook” he said.

Capitalism with a conscience

One of the things that consistently comes up about Zoho is that it has a unique culture. Marc Benioff certainly talks a lot about responsible capitalism something that Vembu tries to live by with his company whether it’s how he operates internally or how he gives back to the community (and the world at large).

In particular Vembu sees his company as a vehicle for addressing inequality in the world either through education or jobs even if he doesn’t see it through a political lens.

“I don’t consider myself from the political left far from it but I do feel strongly about issues like inequality. We need a social contract. We need to have a social compact between the rich and the poor between the companies and the employees all of that” he said.

These are not just words for him. Vembu now lives in India where he helps the local community in a variety of ways. “I moved to a rural village [in India]. I like rural living and I also want to do projects to create jobs create talent all of that. So we run a school. We run a health clinic here. We are building a hospital and we also have a program called Zoho Schools of Learning (formerly Zoho University)” he said.

The latter is a program that has been running for 17 years. It’s designed to give students the knowledge to work at a company like Zoho which recruited 250 students last year. Zoho pays them a stipend and teaches them about various aspects of technology like programming and design. If students make it through the program — and Vembu said most do — they get a job offer from Zoho.

The company also puts its employees front and center as part of this overall philosophy. As an example Vembu said that when the pandemic hit in 2020 he vowed to avoid layoffs no matter how it played out. He acknowledged that if the economic impact dragged out Zoho might eventually need to cut salaries but it never came to that. And he said his attrition rate stayed low during the “Great Resignation” something he attributed to the way his company operates.

Leary agreed that Zoho’s employee-focused policies could lead to a more loyal workforce overall. “Zoho takes a long-view approach and lets its employees develop in a way that not only allows them to grow professionally but also as a close-knit team that seeks to impact their community in a variety of meaningful ways.”

Vembu said this is all consistent with his overall beliefs about running a company — pouring money into developing products while taking some of the profits and giving back — and he sees that as being directly related to staying independent.

“It’s also coming from us staying private because a lot of our profit we earned from business is going into this. It’s going into R&D. It’s going into more figuring out complicated technology. And it is going into all these charitable activities. One thing it is not going into is buying a private jet for myself. That’s right; it’s not going into that because I’m not interested in it” he said chuckling.

No company is perfect but Zoho has managed to grow over the last 17 years without having to answer to outside investors while trying to stay true to its internal core philosophy. And that’s a pretty unusual path for tech companies to take.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8wOS9hbHBoYWJldHMtdmVyaWx5LXJhaXNlcy0xLWJpbGxpb24tYXMtdGVjaC1naWFudHMtZW50ZXItcmVkLWhvdC1oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXNlY3Rvci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alphabet's Verily raises $1 billion as tech giants enter red hot healthcare sector,"Verily the life sciences business under Alphabet said Friday that it has raised $1 billion capital that will be used to expand its data-driven healthcare products tailored to individuals.

The round was led by Alphabet the company said in its announcement.

Verily also announced changes to its executive team that will go into effect January 2023. The company’s founder Andy Conrad will become executive chairman of the Verily board. Stephen Gillett who is president of the company will be promoted to CEO. Gillett initially joined Verily as an operational adviser and to lead the company’s cybersecurity efforts. At the time he was co-founder and CEO of Chronicle an Alphabet cybersecurity company that is now part of Google Cloud.

Deepak Ahuja is leaving the CFO spot by the end of the month. Ahuja the former and first CFO at Tesla has been hired as the first chief financial and business officer at drone delivery and logistics startup Zipline. Ahuja will remain an adviser the company said adding that a search for a new CFO will begin immediately.

The influx of capital and executive shuffling come as Verily readies itself for a new phase of growth in a red hot healthcare sector that has attracted tech giants like Amazon and Apple. Earlier this year Amazon acquired One Medical a primary care provider that leverages in-person digital and virtual interactions in its services in a deal valued at $3.9 billion.

Verily is particularly interested in “precision health” a term meant to describe combining research clinical and non-clinical data and computing power to provide healthcare customized to a person’s specific needs. In other words Verily — which was born out of Google X in 2015 — aims to use technology to provide medical care for individuals instead of everyone.

Verily said the funds may also be used to invest in strategic partnerships global business development and potential acquisitions. The company has already landed a several partnerships and completed at least one acquisition. In 2021 the company bought research software developer SignalPath to expand its clinical trial system. It also has partnered with Lumea L’Oreal the Mayo Clinic and Microsoft."

The ceramic membrane a classic example of an inorganic membrane with excellent features such as high flux and chemical resistance is potentially extremely useful in treating surface water sewage from cities and drinking water.

Membrane fouling however is a major problem for the advancement and development of membrane processes. This problem is prevalent in many membrane processes particularly that of pressure-driven wastewater filtering. Ceramic membrane is hence constrained. Therefore the water treatment process urgently needs an efficient pretreatment method to lower membrane fouling.

As a result of its outstanding performance low cost and capacity to eliminate natural organic matter (NOM) coagulation is one of the most effective methods. The most popular coagulants currently are Al- and Fe-based salts due to their outstanding cost-efficiency and coagulation capabilities.

Despite this Al- and Fe-based salts' biological toxicity and effluent coloration respectively limit their use. Due to their safety superior performance and ability to recycle sludge titanium-based coagulants a sophisticated method have gained considerable attention recently. To accomplish effective and secure water purification it is anticipated that it will be employed as a new generation coagulant to replace Al- and Fe-based coagulants.

Scientists from the University of Jinan Qilu University of Technology (Shandong Academy of Sciences) and the University of Hong Kong assessed the pre-coagulation performance of titanium-based coagulants based on the case of emerging titanium-based coagulant (polytitanium chloride PTC) which was contrasted with traditional Al-based coagulant (polyaluminum chloride PAC).

They used four different mathematical models to synthetically investigate the fouling mechanisms. The study was published in the Frontiers of Environmental Science & Engineering journal.

The research team discovered in this investigation that the newly developed titanium-based coagulant improved the filtration performance of ceramic membranes. In comparison to PAC the PTC demonstrated a sizable advantage that led to an increase in organic matter removal of nearly 20%.

Following PTC-coagulation ceramic membrane filtering of the effluent generated a filtrate with increased quality (approximately 78.0% DOC removal) and a high flux of around 600 L/(m2·h).

With a low filtration flux of just 60 L/(m2·h) the PVDF membrane filtration could achieve a comparable level of DOC removal (around 77.0%). The fouling mechanisms of ceramic membranes were simulated using four mathematical models.

The primary fouling process in the PTC example was cake filtration which was revealed by the use of the classic Hermia’s model. By contrast the main fouling mechanism in the PAC scenario was standard filtration/intermediate filtration (blocking of membrane pores).

Additionally Visvanathan and Ben aïm’s reports on the standard law filtration and traditional cake filtration models were unsuitable for characterizing fouling on ceramic membranes since they did not include R2 values for all possible scenarios. A segmented simulation was necessary to discern the different fouling mechanisms between the PTC and PAC situations using the linear classical Hermia’s model.

This research examined how PTC pre-coagulation improved the cross-flow performance of ceramic membranes. It was discovered that the PTC pre-coagulation could significantly improve ceramic membrane filtration performance and efficiently regulate ceramic membrane fouling.

Ceramic membrane filtration demonstrated good performance for the treatment of surface water. This research offers an efficient pretreatment method to improve water treatment filtration performance and sheds light on the research and testing of sophisticated precoagulation methods to prevent membrane fouling.

1. Summary

The public cloud has a tremendous impact on IT agility and flexibility but it can also lead to increasing costs and potential lock-ins. Growing business needs often lead to the adoption of hybrid and multicloud solutions making it more and more difficult to consolidate data on a single public cloud or on-premises. Additionally applications are becoming more mobile and data should follow along but this may not be possible due to data gravity time and the cost of migration. Such situations create inefficiencies that can limit the ability to build effective multicloud strategies.

To maintain flexibility minimize the risk of lock-in and keep costs down users are looking to build cost-effective data repositories with good performance and standard access interfaces that are accessible from everywhere. They also want to consolidate their data which simplifies data management and many security aspects. In this regard decentralized cloud storage has the potential to become an alternative to traditional cloud storage providers.

A decentralized storage system is based on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network a type of architecture that found some success in the past for data distribution and file sharing. Instead of storing all the data in a centralized system data is chunked distributed and stored in many nodes on a local network or the internet. Figure 1 shows the difference between traditional storage and decentralized storage systems.

Figure 1. Traditional versus Decentralized Storage Systems

Decentralized or P2P storage is not new and we’ve seen attempts—largely unsuccessful ones—to build this kind of infrastructure over the years. However the inherent risks are now mitigated by other important factors such as the enormous amount of unused commodity resources across the internet better security and blockchain technology which can assure data immutability and consistency. It’s now possible to take advantage of the abundance of unused (and sometimes even unreliable) resources to build strong and secure storage infrastructures.

How We Got Here

Blockchain technology plays a fundamental role in decentralized storage as well as “Web3”—a vision for the third iteration of the world wide web (not to be confused with Web 3.0 as defined by Tim Berners-Lee). In practice most implementations of Web3 revolve around the use of cryptocurrencies or non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to consume online services or assert ownership over data.

While some consider NFTs to be proof of ownership of a digital asset there’s no legal basis to back the ownership claim. From a technical point of view an NFT consists of two components: a smart contract listing the transaction (thereby establishing ownership) and a URL that provides a link to the digital asset. Because these links are usually public the asset—even if owned—can be downloaded and copied almost without restriction.

Enterprises view Web3 and NFTs with mistrust. The hype around NFT use as speculative assets the scams and the concerns around design shortcomings—namely the lack of security measures such as role-based access control or a truly enforceable ownership claim—show that Web3 remains an immature technology and so it’s too early for mainstream adoption.

Decentralized storage is also based on blockchain technologies but doesn’t have the design shortcomings and other issues associated with NFTs. Not only can it be used to create an internal currency to simplify raw storage resources and data services trading it can help improve P2P network security information integrity and data reliability.

Decentralized storage and P2P networks are not common in the traditional enterprise and they are usually viewed with much skepticism due to the overall complexity potential risks and other challenges. That said the latest generation of solutions based on this technology can hide most of the complexity while providing a user experience similar to that of traditional public cloud storage with better cost models and security. And thanks to the cloud and the rise of microservices enterprises are more familiar with highly distributed applications and more open to evaluating decentralized infrastructure solutions.

Even though the basic concepts underpinning decentralized storage technology are similar implementations differ greatly. There are several players already focused on different use cases and market segments with many of them targeting developers and enterprises looking for relatively inexpensive and highly secure storage.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR2aWRzaHViLm5ldC9uZXdzLzQyODkzMy9hcm15LWxlYWRlcnMtdG91dC1uZXctZmlyZWFybS1zdG9yYWdlLWZhY2lsaXR50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Army leaders tout new firearm storage facility,"Photo By Rick Emert | FORT CARSON Colo. — Maj.

Mountaineer staff



FORT CARSON Colo. — On first appearance Cheyenne Mountain Shooting Complex’s newest addition resembles an extra-wide shipping container but the heavy steel walls floors and ceiling will help Soldiers store their personally owned weapons in a safe and secure setting.



Fort Carson Army leaders joined CMSC staff Aug. 29 2022 to officially open the new firearm storage facility during a ribbon-cutting ceremony just west of the complex’s main office building.



Maj. Gen. David M. Hodne commanding general 4th Infantry Division and Fort Carson provided the ceremony’s keynote speech and explained the significance of opening the facility in proximity to the Mountain Post.



“This (opening) is really important” he said. “This is about readiness and about access to lethal means. 70% of suicides across the Department of Defense and 71% in our Army in the last fiscal year were tied to firearms. There is a myth that suicide is often well thought out planned in advance and what we’ve realized is that it’s often an impulsive act. If weapons were immediately accessible to a Soldier who is in an emotional state when they are considering taking their lives then we can reduce their access to lethal means and help with the challenge of suicide in our ranks.”



Construction crews began work on the firearm storage facility back in March 2022 in coordination with the Directorate of Emergency Services and the Directorate of Public Works.



“Crews had to expand our concrete pad install fencing and add a concrete walkway to our office to accommodate the new magazine” said Pedro Viorato CMSC program manager.



Fort Carson Soldiers are not permitted to store their privately owned weapons in barracks rooms or vehicles so they typically store them in their unit’s armory. Weapons violations can reduce unit readiness and lead to disciplinary action that may prevent Soldiers from being deployable.



“Weapons have been discovered through routine health and welfare inspections in (on-post) barracks rooms” Hodne said. “And Soldiers have come through the gate where weapons were discovered in their vehicles. Either way it’s important that we provide resources to allow us to address that issue.”



While unit armories provide proper and secure storage methods for personally owned weapons their hours of operation and required administrative tasks make them less than convenient for Soldiers who want to practice or shoot recreationally.



“This weapons magazine will be open and available for use during our normal business hours” said Viorato. “All a user needs to do is check in with us in the office then walk back to the magazine to retrieve their weapon out of their assigned locker. Our operating hours are typically longer than unit armories and Soldiers don’t have to gain approval from their unit leadership to access this magazine at CMSC. The facility contains lockers of varying size to accommodate both handguns and rifles. For a small fee users then secure them with a padlock like any locker.”



In a statement provided by the Army Resilience Directorate (ARD) Army leaders said “Safely storing medications and firearms can be a lifesaving measure by mitigating sudden suicidal ideations.”



According to the Department of Defense Annual Suicide Report use of a firearm occurred in more than 64% of active-duty service member suicides while more than 75% of reservists and more than 79% of National Guard suicides involved the use of a firearm.



An American Public Health Association report concluded that storing firearms and ammunition safely reduces the risk of suicide by 55 to 73%.



“Safely storing firearms and minimizing substances that heighten impulsiveness such as alcohol can drastically change a suicide outcome” the ARD statement said.



This new storage facility is actually the third to be added at CMSC. Viorato said the previous two were added earlier to accommodate the range’s civilian and local law enforcement users.



The 400-acre public shooting complex opened in 2013 as Fort Carson partnered with Colorado Parks and Wildlife the U.S. Forest Service El Paso County and local construction companies to complete the initial project. With the addition of two trap-and-skeet ranges completed in 2018 and a 3D archery range finished in 2021 the complex includes 10 separate ranges for pistol rifle and archery.



The site sits on Army land near Interstate 25 just outside Gate 20 and is open to the public. Shooters using the range do not have to enter Fort Carson. It is one of the only shooting complexes in the Army that is partnered with the Directorate of Family and Morale Welfare and Recreation plus a county. All profits generated through operations go back to Fort Carson.



The new facility opened Wednesday. For the first 30 days Soldiers have priority and if space is available other eligible users will have access to the storage. CMSC staff plan to open the service and storage facility to all active-duty Soldiers and other eligible users in the coming months.

Qualcomm obviously doesn’t given that Arm’s suit last week asks for damages as well as the company to throw out the work that Nuvia once the saving grace of Arm’s desktop processor ambitions has put into place.

Microsoft shouldn’t assuming that it still believes in a competitive hardware ecosystem for Windows on Arm that has been spearheaded by Qualcomm and its Snapdragon processors.

And Arm shouldn’t either given that Qualcomm has a chance to crack open the PC market which is currently a toss-up between the rival X86 architectures of AMD and Intel. (Well okay — neither one of these two companies would benefit from the increased competition.)

But here we are with Arm threatening Qualcomm one of its chief licensees as the entire Snapdragon PC ecosystem sputters along while Nuvia works behind the scenes to save the day.

Neither Qualcomm nor Windows on Arm is down and out. But boy a lawsuit is exactly what Qualcomm doesn’t need right now.

According to Reuters Arm is seeking an injunction that would ask Qualcomm to “destroy” the designs that Nuvia is working on with Qualcomm. In 2021 Qualcomm bought the Nuvia design team and intellectual property. Nuvia has never announced a product but the suspicion was that Nuvia was working on an Arm processor that could be used for both servers as well as mobile PCs and perhaps even desktops.

Arm contends that it had separate business and licensing agreements with Nuvia and Qualcomm and that Qualcomm was required to re-negotiate the agreement after it bought Nuvia. Qualcomm did not and Arm says Nuvia’s work is therefore illegally using Arm’s intellectual property.

Windows on Arm with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon already suffered from two problems: a lack of pure performance and compatibility concerns. The latter at least has been largely solved. Still Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processors already lag rival Intel badly in terms of performance; in PCWorld’s tests the 2021 Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2 5G processor finished behind the 2014 Microsoft Surface Pro 3 and its Core i5-4300 processor in the PCMark 8 Creative benchmark.

Laptops built on Qualcomm Snapdragon still make sense but less so than they used to. Laptops built on Qualcomm Snapdragon still make sense but less so than they used to. Mark Hachman / IDG Laptops built on Qualcomm Snapdragon still make sense but less so than they used to. Mark Hachman / IDG Mark Hachman / IDG

Nuvia’s well-regarded design teams were expected to solve that problem with the new design. But the timetable has slipped and the processors that Nuvia planned were originally scheduled to ship in 2023 were recast as shipping in “late 2023” earlier this year.

Let’s recap: Qualcomm and Windows on Arm couldn’t run every program than an X86 chip could until recently. Qualcomm’s current Snapdragon chips don’t offer remotely competitive performance. The two advantages Snapdragon chips did have long battery life and always-on connectivity were undercut by X86 laptops that crammed in more battery cells to offset what Qualcomm offered. Don’t forget that the world spent about two years of a pandemic commuting back and forth between the kitchen table and the couch.

Now the apparent best-case scenario calls for Qualcomm to release its next-gen Nuvia CPUs in late 2023 which puts it up not against today’s “Alder Lake” nor this fall’s “Raptor Lake” but Intel’s 14th-generation “Meteor Lake” chip and processors like AMD’s Dragon Range.

Really could it get any tougher?

A suit could quiet the Nuvia hype

Qualcomm naturally denies Arm’s claims. “Arm’s lawsuit marks an unfortunate departure from its longstanding successful relationship with Qualcomm” according to Ann Chaplin general counsel for Qualcomm in a statement. “Arm has no right contractual or otherwise to attempt to interfere with Qualcomm’s or Nuvia’s innovations. Arm’s complaint ignores the fact that Qualcomm has broad well-established license rights covering its custom-designed CPUs and we are confident those rights will be affirmed.”

It seems reasonable according to Bob O’Donnell founder of TECHnalysis Research that the two sides will simply exchange some money to resolve the situation — what O’Donnell called “weird” in an obvious understatement.

“I think they’re going to have to work as if nothing was going on” O’Donnell said. “At some point some money is going to exchange hands hopefully sooner rather than later. And it gets resolved because obviously the longer it drags on the more serious the questions become in all of it.”

Those questions include whether or not Nuvia can legally continue work of course but also whether it could hold to its original timetable with the suit hanging over its head — or whether the Nuvia chips would slip from late 2023 to early 2024. There’s also a question whether Qualcomm can begin promoting what its upcoming Nuvia-designed chips can actually do something it typically reserves for its Snapdragon Technology Summit scheduled for Nov. 15.

This is how Qualcomm pitched Nuvia’s future to analysts last November: “setting the performance benchmark for Windows PCs.” This is how Qualcomm pitched Nuvia’s future to analysts last November: “setting the performance benchmark for Windows PCs.” Qualcomm This is how Qualcomm pitched Nuvia’s future to analysts last November: “setting the performance benchmark for Windows PCs.” Qualcomm Qualcomm

That’s important because even if Nuvia doesn’t have silicon to show then executives unfettered by legal concerns could talk about expected performance or potential markets or any number of things to keep Nuvia’s name circulating — and let’s face it the entire Windows on Arm ecosystem needs a little hype right now. But does anyone believe that Qualcomm can achieve this when realistically any talk about Nuvia will have to be cleared by its legal department?

Again for now Qualcomm’s remaining positive. The company plans to share “updates across all of our business lines including Compute” at the Summit according to a Qualcomm representative.

O’Donnell isn’t the only analyst who thinks that this will blow over. Patrick Moorhead principal at Moor Insights says

“I don’t think the lawsuit will slow down Qualcomm’s internal development efforts or its OEM and ODM partners “Moorhead wrote in an instant message. “While some of those partners have expressed concern to me they also have confidence that it will get resolved. Both Qualcomm and Arm have an incredible opportunity to go after 93 percent of the PC market and it is in the industry’s best interests to get it resolved.”

“I am sure Apple AMD and Intel are enjoying all of this” Moorhead added.

But as O’Donnell noted November isn’t the first opportunity that Qualcomm will be questioned about the future of Nuvia and its Snapdragon processors. That will likely come in just two weeks when Qualcomm holds an “Automotive Investor Day” in New York City.

Now with five models in the Edge 30 range (and perhaps a few more to come) Motorola can offer premium features in all the mid-range-to-premium price branckets. We are highly impressed with the g-series too which are mostly class leaders in their respective price brackets.

RL,Ralph Lauren Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9tZW5zd2Vhci1uZXdzL21lbnMtcmV0YWlsLWJ1c2luZXNzL2Jsb29taW5nZGFsZXMtMTUwLWRhbi1sZXBwby1tZW5zLWNvc21ldGljcy1ob21lLTEyMzUyOTcxMTMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Bloomingdales Modernized Men's Cosmetics and Home With Dan Leppo,"The story has now become legend.

In 1967 when Ralph Lauren was just starting out he talked the team at Bloomingdale’s into buying his fledgling line of wide men’s neckties. The relationship that began that day has persevered and today the designer’s brand is one of the retailer’s top vendors.

But that was just one of the menswear milestones the department store has racked up over the course of its storied 150-year history.

“The partnership with Ralph — from the introduction of the ties to the first shop in America — is the one that gets a lot of press and is the foundation of our very special relationship with the Ralph Lauren Corp. but we also launched Canali in the U.S. and countless other brands” said Dan Leppo executive vice president and general merchandise manager of men’s kids’ cosmetics and home. “We were also the first to use sports stars in our marketing” and the Saturday’s Generation department was viewed as a model for merchandising young men’s during its heyday in the ’70s.

Bloomingdale’s was the first retailer to buy Ralph Lauren’s wide neckties.

But the store is not resting on its laurels and continues to evolve the men’s offering as it looks toward the next century.

“As we look ahead” Leppo said “what I’m most excited about is the continued evolution of menswear.”

Dan Leppo Masato Onoda/WWD

The store is just completing a renovation of the men’s store at the 59th Street flagship where the team was able to “re-conceptualize” the floors “based on how menswear is changing” he said.

That includes the opening of a 13000-square-foot reimagined shoe department that boasts 70 percent more space and a wide assortment of casual and dress shoes — from designer to performance brands — as well as accessories select fragrances and a gallery of hats.

The department addresses the needs of today’s customers who are willing to own many more shoes for a variety of occasions — both dress and casual. In addition to sneakers this includes shoes from “powerful brands” such as Gucci Valentino Tod’s Saint Laurent and others — many of whom have installed new shop concepts at the store.

But that was just the beginning. There are also new areas for denim and advanced contemporary vendors. “This is the first time that apparel runs from Lexington to Third Avenue on one floor” Leppo said. The presentation is fluid and includes “innovative smaller brands in the center” he said. There are shops for Vince Theory and Stone Island and an area for contemporary bridge brands such as Boss Varvatos and All Saints. On the north side of the store where shoes used to be housed are classic sportswear brands such as Peter Millar along with smaller boutique brands including Sid Mashburn and Faherty. Other brands that are being highlighted include Kenzo Helmut Lang and Officine Generale he said.

Leppo further revealed that after a break of some four or five years the company’s Double RL brand will make its return this fall the store is building its relationship with Los Angeles-based Ami and continues to expand with Balenciaga Saint Laurent Tod’s and Zegna. “We’re very excited about our continued elevation” he said.

But the more “gentlemanly brands” haven’t been forgotten either with new shops for Canali Armani and the Ermenegildo Zegna made-to-measure offering as well as Eton. But rather focusing primarily on dress assortments upscale sportswear is also part of the mix addressing what Leppo described as a “modern expression of how a gentleman wears a more-tailored garment.”

This represents a rethinking of a category that has been dramatically impacted by the pandemic.

Leppo explained: “We asked ourselves if we were going to spend any energy trying to make tailored clothing go from terrible to just awful or move to where the customer is going as he comes out of COVID-19 and into having to go to events out to dinner to the office. He wants to look more polished and we really conceptualized how we were going to present the floor with strong dressier sportswear presentations.”

So rather than focusing exclusively on nested suits the store shows a Harrington jacket with a drawstring pant for example to address the demand for hybrid dressing and more-comfortable options.

“What’s really exciting about menswear at the moment is how many men are really engaged in fashion” Leppo said. “If you think about the evolution of menswear over the last 25 years there’s continued interest in a man shopping for himself and the blending of the work and weekend wardrobe. And what that’s allowed is a broad-based recovery with things that are very contemporary and very classic both being strong. Streetwear is evolving — it’s a little less logo-driven sneakers are too and we see the rise of Birkenstock and On Running. But that’s the beauty of being a department store. If we are on our game then we are going where the customer is going. That’s much harder to do when you’re a vertical specialty store.”

And although the macroeconomic situation is always a concern Leppo has learned not to focus on things he can’t control.

“What we’re doing is staying agile and nimble to continue to flow goods that the customer is interested in and move where they’re moving. And the customer is moving faster than he has ever moved before.”

Leppo said this fast-changing consumer is not just in New York City but in other cities where Bloomingdale’s has stores as well.

“There used to be a much longer lag between something being very hot in New York L.A. and Miami and then reaching the suburbs” he said. But in this social media world “the timeline is so much shorter. So things may fall off a little faster in some of the big urban markets and last a little longer in some suburban markets but in terms of the level of interest and awareness it’s a much shorter delta than it used to be.”

Bloomingdale’s has a thriving home department.

In addition to men’s Leppo has also been merchandising the home business since 2015. While many competitors have deemphasized or exited that end of the business it remains an integral part of Bloomingdale’s success.

“Home is a big business for us” he said. “We’re really the only upscale full-line store in the U.S.: we have furniture bedding housewares kitchen electronics cookware tabletop luggage and a very robust bridal registry business.”

Leppo said the store has built a reputation as the “fashion home store. We have a business model that makes us much more like a Bon Marche Printemps or Harrods. It takes up three full floors at the flagship. We have some of the biggest luxury brands in the world like Frette Baccarat and Christofle. I can’t think of another luxury department store in the world that has 72 beds on its textile floor.”

Although the category has always been a differentiator the business was especially strong during the pandemic when everyone was sheltering at home.

“There was interest in cooking an interest in renewing your decor when you decided you hated the bed you’re sleeping in or you couldn’t stand your couch anymore” he said. “Then there was a moment in April of 2020 when Amazon started prioritizing shipping staples to customers and de-prioritized some of their other businesses. And Starbucks pretty much closed all of their stores nationwide. All of a sudden it was Christmas every day for us because I could get orders to customers in 48 hours. That was the first inkling that this could be really interesting for the home business. And it led customers who loved us and our apparel to discover us for home too.”

The store’s booming bridal registry has provided a boost to the home business.

And Leppo is expecting the momentum to continue.

“We’re in a moment right now where there will be the most weddings since 1984. And we have a very strong bridal registry business. Tabletop is very strong right now as is luggage as people begin to travel again both for pleasure and for work.”

One year ago Leppo was also given oversight of the cosmetics business a lucrative category with an “energy and buzz” like no other. Now that the pandemic has eased the store will be returning to events this fall bringing aestheticians back to the floor along with makeup clinics and other popular customer draws such as spa rooms in every store where shoppers can work privately with associates to test skincare products — from La Prairie and Lancôme to Clinique.

This blending of entertainment with commerce has helped Bloomingdale’s build big businesses with its brand partners in a variety of categories.

Leppo cited luxury fragrance as a business that has been “incredibly strong” from Maison Francis Kurkdjian to Creed and Number 9 which have been “absolutely stunning in their growth. They’re very limited in their distribution and offer incredible value for what they are.”

The treatment business led by brands such as La Prairie and Sisley is strong and while color overall “has been a little slower in its return” Chanel has been a standout as has Charlotte Tilbury and Dior he said.

While cosmetics is dominated by product targeted to women men have also shown more interest in the category.

“Men have become more engaged in treatment” he said. “And on the fragrance side it’s a very big piece of the business” with brands such as Tom Ford and Kiehl’s especially popular with guys.

For both genders the days of the aggressive spritzers are long past replaced by an elevated service experience that helps customers better understand the value and properties distinct to each product.

Cosmetics has been a mainstay of the business for decades.

Regardless of department Bloomingdale’s will be celebrating its anniversary throughout the store with a slew of special events.

In men’s Leppo singled out a Zegna bespoke event that goes beyond the traditional trunk show and will instead include stylists who work with celebrities for award shows to provide their distinct sensibilities to Bloomingdale’s customers.

In a full-circle moment the team is also working with Ralph Lauren on a special capsule for the anniversary. And while there may or may not be wide ties the store will take over the bar restaurant for lunch to treat customers to a meal.

So what’s on tap for Bloomingdale’s for the next 150 years? Leppo is taking it one day at a time.

“We spend a lot of time trying to be of the moment” he said. Whether that’s “landmark moments like the Ralph shop” or partnerships with Rent Evan Hanson the Beatles Rob Thomas of Matchbox 20 and other moments over the years “I hope we spend just as much energy and effort being of the moment for the next 150 years because that’s really our connection with our customer and where their mind-set is.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTA5LTA5L3JvYmxveC1wbGFucy10by1pbnRyb2R1Y2UtYWRzLWluLWdhbWVzLXRvLWJvb3N0LXJldmVudWXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Roblox Jumps on Plan to Introduce Immersive Ads in Games,"Why did this happen?

Located in the parklike setting of Amagansett Square the boutique also carries napkins and tablecloths which can be coordinated or mixed and matched.

“No fuss always stylish is something that we always think about when we are designing” says founder Stacey Fraser. “We also like to think about infusing the spirit of a sunny day into everything we do.”

A former fashion designer for Ralph Lauren Baby Gap Tommy Hilfiger and Old Navy Fraser took some time off when her second daughter was born and started making dresses for her girls out of the cherished vintage textiles she’d been collecting over the years.

“People would stop us and say ‘That’s so cute. Where did you get that?’” she recalls.

Burnt out from so many hours spent in the office and away for work Fraser relished the idea of having her own business which began with her selling dresses wholesale. In 2009 she opened a tiny shop on Main Street in Amagansett and moved to the current space six years ago.

These days Fraser is one of a several designers for Pink Chicken which now boasts five stores.

“We have a lean and mean and scrappy team” Fraser says. “It’s really been a true labor of love.”

For the past 13 years Pink Chicken has been printing its own fabrics and each year commissions a couple of different artists whose designs are incorporated into its collection.

“One of the things that people like about us is our original pattern work” Fraser says. “We always have a vintage inspiration. So there’s a familiarity when people see our prints and a quirkiness to it.”

Integral to Pink Chicken’s mission is giving back. At the end of each season excess clothes are donated to Baby to Baby Good Plus Foundation and other organizations. To date the company has given away 28000 pieces of clothing.

And come November they’ll be starting a new initiative that aims to inspire giving back in children.

Roblox Boasts of Its Popularity in Russia Even as Rivals Have Left

Bloomberg — Roblox Corp.’s popularity in Russia is increasing even as almost every other publicly traded gaming company has retreated from the country after its invasion of Ukraine.

At Roblox’s developer conference on Friday Chief Executive Officer Dave Baszucki said Russia sees more than 2 million active Roblox users a day. Russians are among Roblox’s largest consumer base after the US Brazil and the Philippines. The US has more than 11 million daily active users.

“We’re growing in every country” Baszucki said.

Roblox said it’s also getting a boost from a machine translation tool in the Russian language which saw playtime increase 3.6% among those who used it compared with those who didn’t.

PUBLICIDAD

Electronic Arts Inc. Nintendo Co. Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. Epic Games Inc. Ubisoft Entertainment SA Microsoft Corp. and Sony Group Corp. have slowed or ceased sales from Russia. The moves are in line with a long list of multinational companies that have withdrawn from the country amid government sanctions and financial and reputational risks to continuing to do business in Russia since it invaded Ukraine in February.

Roblox said in a statement that its “mission is to unite a billion people around the world with optimism and civility and as a global platform we believe the right direction is to enable people around the world to stay as connected as possible.”

Also at the developers conference Roblox announced plans to introduce ads into the virtual worlds created on its platform next year. Roblox has had lucrative partnerships with the likes of Ralph Lauren Chipotle and other top companies to offer users branded games virtual concerts and items. But the plan is to go even further for players to be able to interact with advertisements inside of games including ones that function as portals taking gamers to branded zones Baszucki said.

When Howard University coach Larry Scott steps onto the Raymond James Stadium turf for Saturday night's game against the USF Bulls it will be more than the next contest on his team's schedule.

It's a flashback to Scott's former life.

Scott played for USF's inaugural football team and was a three-time letterman as an offensive lineman from 1997-99 even performing during the first year of 1996 (when there were no games just practices). Scott then served as a USF assistant coach from 2005-12.

It's also a sentimental journey for three members of Scott's Howard coaching staff — running back/receiver Lindsey Lamar the 2010 Big East Conference Special Teams Player of the Year along with former Bulls assistants Vernon Hargreaves and Troy Douglas .

Lary Scott (#70) was part of the Bulls' first team in 1997 and later served on the coaching staff.

Scott said he continues to follow USF's program and he's excited about the $22-million Indoor Performance Facility along with plans for the on-campus stadium.

It wasn't like that when USF football began — not even close.

Scott from Sebring High School agreed to a recruiting visit with USF's fledgling program. Scott and his parents circled the campus frantically searching for the address of USF's football ""complex.'' Finally they noticed Bulls coach Jim Leavitt and defensive coordinator Rick Kravitz  standing outside a single trailer and waving their arms.

""I vividly remember that day'' Scott said. ""We got the grand tour — the grand tour of nothing. Those guys were very imaginative. They could've sold snow to an Eskimo.''

Scott remembers viewing an open field and being told the Bulls would one day practice there. He saw the future locker room — ""I think it was a storage closet'' Scott said — and a spot for the weight room which didn't have any weights bars benches or platforms.

But Scott bought into the vision of USF football.

""I wanted to be part of building something that was special'' Scott said.

And that's what happened. Scott and his teammates laid the foundation for a program that ascended into the Football Bowl Subdivision in its fourth season. Over the program's first decade or so the Bulls defeated the likes of Florida State Miami Pittsburgh West Virginia Auburn North Carolina NC State Kansas Clemson and Notre Dame. The rapid growth led to USF earning the nation's No. 2 ranking in 2007 then becoming Florida's fastest program to 150 wins in 2018.

Lindsey Lamar played and coached at USF.

""What we went through that to get the program going — and going from such humble beginnings to the big time in such a short amount of time — there's nobody else who can tell stories like that even if you went to Florida FSU or Miami'' Scott said. ""It's extremely unique and I think the whole story of USF football is captivating.

""I experienced the first-ever game (80-3 win against Kentucky Wesleyan) and the range of emotions were like being a kid at Christmas just being a part of that. When we got to No. 2 I was an assistant and it just showed what could happen when you're singularly focused on a goal.

""I've had a lot of stops (assistant coach at Miami Tennessee and Florida before becoming Howard's head coach in 2020). We're selling a vision at Howard too and we want our guys to realize what you can get from hard work and being devoted to your program. That's what we learned at USF. It's still a part of me and I'm proud of it.''

Scouting Report On Howard

Howard a Football Championship Subdivision program enters at 0-2 after defeats against Alabama State (23-13 in the MEAC/SWAC Challenge at Atlanta) and Hampton (31-28). Against Hampton the Bison rallied with 22 fourth-quarter points including a pair of touchdown passes in the last four minutes. Senior quarterback Quinton Williams had a career-high four touchdown passes including two to 6-foot-7 tight end Christion Carter.

Howard (3-8 in 2021) was picked fifth in the MEAC's preseason poll. The Bison had five players named to the first-team All-MEAC — defensive back Kenny Gallop Jr. wide receiver Antoine Murray defensive lineman Darren Brokenburr offensive tackle Anim Dankwah and guard Darius Fox while running back Jaret Hunter return specialist Ian Wheeler and center Deshawn Ingram were named to the second team.

In 2021 Williams completed 176-of-301 passes for 2353 yards and 16 touchdowns in leading the MEAC's second-best passing offense. Williams has his top two receivers returning — Murray (33 catches for 629 yards and seven touchdowns in 2021) and Matthew McDonald (20 catches for 288 yards and four touchdowns). Howard also features highly regarded freshman running back Eden James

son of Pro Football Hall of Famer Edgerrin James a native of Immokalee.

Trivia Time

Larry Scott 's first USF season in 1997 was held at the old Tampa Stadium (along with the first two games in 1998). When the Bulls moved to the new Raymond James Stadium on Oct. 3 1998 who was the opponent? (see answer below).

Looking Ahead

USF heads to Gainesville on Sept. 17 to face the No. 12-ranked Florida Gators who opened with a riveting 29-26 home victory against the Utah Utes. The Gators begin SEC play on Saturday while hosting the Kentucky Wildcats.

The Bulls visited Gainesville once before in 2010 falling 38-14 against the Gators in Skip Holtz 's second game as head coach at USF. Quarterback B.J. Daniels led a 17-play 96-yard drive on USF's first possession scoring on a 2-yard pass to tight end Andrew Ketchel.

Trivia Answer

In its first game at Raymond James Stadium USF defeated The Citadel 45-6 on Oct. 3 1998.

(WLOX) - Singing River Health System is one step closer to a new owner.

During a brief meeting Friday afternoon Jackson County supervisors voted unanimously to move forward with selling the county-owned healthcare provider.

Jackson County residents had an opportunity to petition for a public vote on the sale but proponents of a referendum didn’t collect enough signatures in time to get the matter on the November ballot.

That means the next step is for county supervisors to put out a request for bids. Raymond James a third-party healthcare-focused advisory firm will help facilitate the request for proposal (RFP) process.

“We’re excited about what this next chapter might look like for Singing River Health System and look forward to collaborating with Raymond James and the BOS to help determine the qualifications for a potential partner in the RFP process” Singing River Health System CEO Tiffany Murdock said.

Singing River Health System is the second-largest employer in Jackson County with about 3500 employees. It has locations in Ocean Springs Pascagoula and Gulfport. Its Board of Trustees already approved a sale saying the system is struggling financially especially after losses due to the pandemic.

County leaders say once the RFP process is complete the county will adopt a resolution describing its intention to sell the hospital and why it’s in the best interest of residents. That resolution must then be published for three weeks before any proposed sale date.

Singing River Health System has also created a website with updates on the sale process. Learn more at SingingRiverForward.com

The only appropriate image to memorialize Brady’s years with the Bucs would be of him tossing the Lombardi Trophy from one boat to another during the Hillsborough River parade for the 2020 season Super Bowl win. It should include daughter Vivian mouth agape screaming “Nooooo!” Tight end Cameron Brate should be seated in the other vessel waiting to save the Bucs from having to hire divers to retrieve the silver-plated prize.

That trophy like Brady’s career in Tampa Bay may always feel like a moment suspended in time.

This is Brady’s third — and likely final — season with the Bucs. His announcement in March that he was ending a 40-day retirement to return in 2022 may have been worthy of its own boat parade for all he has meant to the organization and the community.

“His impact is unprecedented and invaluable in terms of the stage that he helped not only put the franchise on but also our sports community” said Rob Higgins executive director of the Tampa Bay Sports Commission. “I’ll never forget when he signed with the Bucs (in March 2020) the national media attention that we immediately got it was like flipping a switch.

“Then you see from not only the social media mentions but also the number of prime-time (TV) games … my guess is the number of prime-time games we’ve had in his tenure rivals if not exceeds the number of prime-time games we had the previous 15 years. It’s almost to the point where the attention that he gets is so massive that it’s not just a once-in-a-generation thing it’s a once-in-several-generations thing and it’s truly unique.”

Brady is about dollars and change.

The amount of money he has brought to the Bucs in terms of ticket sales memorabilia purchases and franchise value is significant despite playing his first season amid the restrictions of COVID-19.

Some of the unprecedented growth of Tampa Bay has occurred during Brady’s time with the Bucs. Several factors have contributed to that growth but Brady has provided the opportunity for many idyllic views of the area on national television.

The change is how Brady has transformed a mostly losing culture in the 2000s into a winning one one goose bump at a time. He also has helped import free agents who came to Tampa Bay believing Brady would slip a Super Bowl ring on their fingers.

Brady had played only three games with the Bucs before the Lightning beat the Stars to win the 2020 Stanley Cup. The Rays lost the World Series to the Dodgers in six games a month later. But the area didn’t become known as Champa Bay until the Bucs beat the Chiefs 31-9 in Super Bowl 55 in February 2021 at Raymond James becoming the first NFL team to win the championship in their home stadium.

His reach doesn’t stop there. If your kids go to school in Pinellas County their health and fitness regimen may soon be the result of a program adopted from TB12 the health and fitness industry Brady founded with trainer Alex Guerrero.

Changing the culture

Before Brady arrived the Bucs had not reached the playoffs for 12 consecutive seasons. Only twice during that time did they enjoy winning records. Coach Raheem Morris went 10-6 in 2010 and Dirk Koetter went 9-7 in 2016.

The Bucs had assembled a core of pretty good players — receivers Mike Evans and Chris Godwin among them — but the quarterback position was an issue. Jameis Winston led the NFL in passing in 2019 but he also threw a league-worst 30 interceptions.

When the greatest quarterback of all time walks into your locker room heads snap. Brady joined the team having owned regular-season and postseason records for touchdown passes wins games started most passing yards and most passing touchdowns.

Brady does it by being the champion of every day. He tries to win every rep make every right decision call every right audible and treat everyone the right way.

Just by walking in the Bucs’ locker room Brady methodically elevated the standards of everyone from quarterbacks to video-room interns.

“He raises the level of work ethic and consistency in practice without saying anything” coach Todd Bowles said. “Because he’s Tom Brady and he comes out there and they expect to win because he’s got all these accolades. There are guys around him that want to be just as good not let him down carry their weight and do all the little things right.

“They see how he trains. They see how it works. And they want to do that on their own without anyone ever saying anything. They want to learn how to watch film on their own. They want to learn how to do fundamentals more. They want to learn how to get in better shape.

“They want to learn how to eat right and they just want to compete because they don’t want to let the guy down.”

Brady also is the NFL’s best recruiter. When you are the Lord of Rings free agents want to join your team.

“If I’m thinking about a player or we are as a staff I’ll give (Brady) a call and see if he can help us out and he’s always willing to do it” general manager Jason Licht said.

Most of the time Licht and Brady are in agreement about which players to pursue.

“We didn’t have to kick too many weeds to find out about Julio Jones (signed this offseason). We’ve known about him awhile and Kyle Rudolph was the best tight end that was available.

“We have a lot of communication. So does Todd (Bowles) and Tom and myself. We talk a lot about players. … When you have Tom Brady as the greatest it’s even more of an advantage and I’m never going to apologize for using him to help me bring in players for this team.”

Once those players arrive the discussions with Brady commence.

“I came from a team where we ran the ball a lot but he’s definitely helped me when it comes to receiving and catching the ball and things like that and understanding defense” said running back Leonard Fournette signed in September 2020 after the Jaguars waived him.

“What he has with his knowledge I listen to a guy like that. I’m also trying to see what he wants as a player and (what) helps him bring his game to the next level. We have a great relationship on and off the field and I think that’s what helps us when we play.”

Several dozen players are clients of TB12 which has a Tampa office a half-mile from the Bucs’ training facility.

Preparing the way Brady does with proper nutrition hydration and recovery has become the routine for many of his teammates.

“I think he brings that to any team he goes to just by default” Bowles said. “I think that makes the team’s expectations rise and gives guys who haven’t won in a while … that sense of relief that they can win. It kind of raises everyone’s level to try and get better.”

Ticket sales and more

When Brady arrived in Tampa Bay the Bucs’ season-ticket base had been eroded by more than a decade of bad football and a carousel of coaches.

Their number of season-ticket holders had dwindled to around 25000. In 2019 the year before Brady arrived the Bucs averaged 50728 per game at Raymond James Stadium. And a large portion of that attendance was fans supporting the visiting team.

All that changed when Brady agreed to play for the Bucs. Not only did the season tickets sell out the entire 65618-seat stadium once the pandemic subsided the Bucs added 3600 seats this year to the south end zone bringing the capacity to near 70000.

“Tom has had a tremendous impact on our organization both on and off the field” said Bucs chief operating officer Brian Ford. “There has been a level of increased anticipation and excitement from our fans. His presence alone has created an unprecedented demand for tickets that we have been working hard to meet.

“We are anticipating playing our regular-season home games before the largest crowds ever at Raymond James Stadium and much of that credit goes to having an iconic player such as Tom leading the way.”

High-end sky suites and club seats have no vacancy. In a shrewd business move after Brady returned the Bucs requested a two-year minimum commitment for season tickets. Brady is not signed for 2023.

Impact on the community

Higgins is tasked with bringing sports events of all kinds to Tampa Bay and business has never been better.

Tampa Bay has hosted Super Bowls college national championship football games college hockey final fours the NCAA men’s and women’s basketball tournaments.

But nothing strikes up a conversation about the area quicker than a question or two about Brady.

Event organizers tune in to watch the Bucs play on national television and they see a sold-out stadium as well as gorgeous sunsets over water.

“It serves as a catalyst to bigger conversations” Higgins said. “When we have prime-time games we have the ability to then work with the networks and tell the story of how far we’ve come as a community and where we’re going. It’s that spark and what we need that door swinging open that we can walk through and showcase all these different things we have going on that’s truly amazing.”

Though Tampa Bay was not granted the full Super Bowl host experience when it was played here during the pandemic limiting game attendance to around 25000 Brady and the Bucs never wavered from the opportunity to make history.

“It was a Super Bowl when we needed it the most and from a timing standpoint” Higgins said. “From the way that it ended with our hometown becoming the first team to win it (in its home stadium) it was truly special. The impact is still being felt today.”

Last year from the Bucs’ Week One game to kick off the season against the Cowboys through their two playoff games against the Eagles and Rams local hotel occupancy on the nights before and after Sunday home games was more than 13 percent higher than it was on Bucs road and bye weekends according to data provided by Visit Tampa Bay. Bookings were also up around the Bucs’ Thursday and Monday night games.

Brady also hasn’t just been hidden away behind the walls of some mansion on Davis Islands.

He has supported and attended the foundation events held by former coach Bruce Arians and Evans.

Recently Brady’s foundation forged a partnership with the Tampa Bay Sports Commission in an effort to help kids.

“The thing that I think is most impressive about Tom is not only his commitment to success on the field but it’s also his commitment to making a difference off the field” Higgins said. “There’s a reason he’s been successful for so long and that’s his commitment to wellness and recovery and living a healthy lifestyle. For us to be able to work with him to impart those lessons on our community’s kids is fantastic and we just truly appreciate him working with us to be able to do that.”

On a recent off day Brady and two of his three children Vivian and Ben spent part of the afternoon with teammate Logan Ryan at the Humane Society of Tampa Bay visiting shelter dogs and promoting them for adoption.

Brady has found an adoptive home of his own in Tampa Bay — at least for one more year.

“I chose the right place for me” Brady said. “I’m very grateful to everybody to allow me to come down here and experience this part of my football life which I look back and it probably would be incomplete had I not had it. I’m happy I’ve had it.”

According to People Magazine Gisele isn't set to attend his first game this Sunday.

A source with the Buccaneers tells People Magazine that ""it's always a big thing when Gisele is coming to watch the game"" with extra security and snacks for the family but ""as of right now there's none of that for Sunday's game.""

The insider adds that people are not bringing up Bündchen 42 around Brady. Wow. Now that's tense!

The next-gen GPU stats match up with previous claims with rumours previously citing double speeds in TimeSpy Extreme.

Spotted by Twitter user 9550pro the RTX 4090 benchmark originally popped up in a Chiphell post but has now been deleted. Tested using 3DMark the RTX 4000 GPU seemingly achieves a score of 20192 – slightly higher than the 19K suggested by earlier rumours.



Image credit: 9550pro

The RTX 4000 leak also includes clock speed stats and they could be considered abnormal. It’s believed the RTX 4090 features a 2520MHz boost clock but the leaked benchmarks list a lofty 3015MHz. Comparatively the RTX 3090 Ti maxes out 1860MHz so its successor could leave it truly in the dust.

As with all RTX 4000 performance leaks we’d advise ingesting the above benchmarks with the usual grain of salt. The RTX 4090 will undoubtedly fight for the best graphics card crown upon release but we’ll need to test it for ourselves to paint a true performance picture.

RTX 4000 announcement

Thankfully it looks like Nvidia is about to spill all its next-gen secrets as an RTX 4000 announcement is scheduled for this month. The green team’s “Project Beyond” event lines up with CEO Jensen Huang’s GTC 2022 keynote so it’s likely we’ll hear all about the RTX 4090 and the company’s future plans.

That said there’s still a chance only the RTX 4090 will arrive this year as Nvidia is supposedly struggling to decide on final RTX 4070 specs. In addition we might end up with two RTX 4080 flavours releasing at the same time as two VRAM variants appear to be on the cards.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9udmlkaWEtZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtNDAtYWQxMDYtYW5kLWFkMTA3LWdwdXMtdG8tZmVhdHVyZS04LXBjaWUtbGFuZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 AD106 and AD107 GPUs to feature 8 PCIe lanes,"Please note that this post is tagged as a rumor .

NVIDIA preparing smaller Ada GPUs

Hardware leaker Kopte7kimi claims that AD106 GPU will outclass RTX 3070 from current generation.

NVIDIA Ada GPUs for GeForce RTX 40 series will include at least 5 different processors. This information has already been confirmed through leaked documents (NVIDIA hack). Said documents revealed CUDA configuration and increased L2 cache sizes of each GPU such information would still otherwise be a domain of speculation. What has not been known until now however was how many PCI Express lanes each GPU has.

AD106 is not very strong. The typical TSE score is < 7000.

And both AD106 and AD107 are using PCIE x8. — kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) September 10 2022

According to Kopite both AD106 and AD107 will have 8 PCIe lanes. The leaker previously mentioned PCIe Gen4 but one might expect Gen5 at this point especially when Hopper architecture already supports the newer standard. Should AD106 be used with Gen5 for RTX 4060 series that would be the same bandwidth as Gen4 x16 on RTX 3060.

The only scenario where this should be considered a downgrade is when the system or GPU do not support Gen5. In that case the bandwidth will drop from 32 GT/s to 16 GT/s. However that should still have a small impact on performance. The AD107 would reportedly also support 8 lanes only. The current model (GA107) is already limited to 8 lanes.

If rumors are to be believed neither AD106 nor AD107 are to launch this year. NVIDIA is currently working on AD102 AD103 and AD104 GPUs set to launch in the coming months. Kopite is also mentioning that AD106 performance is now estimated at 7000 points in 3DMark Time Spy Extreme which is ‘not very strong’ in his words. However that is still in a territory of RTX 3070 series performance.

Adding to the hype train is yet another alleged leaked benchmark for what will be the flagship card of the expected three initial releases: the RTX 4090.

Screenshots of an unnamed card appeared on China's Chiphell forums so take them with the usual pinch of salt. They were shared on Twitter by user HXL (via VideoCardz). The 3DMark Time Spy Extreme score is a massive 20192 suggesting this is the RTX 4090 which scored 19000 in another leaked 3DMark Time Spy Extreme graphics test in July.

Assuming the screenshots are the real deal the score makes the RTX 4090 90% faster than the Ampere equivalent the RTX 3090. That lines up with previous reports of the Lovelace card being around twice as fast as its predecessor. It also makes the RTX 4090 78% faster than the current-gen RTX 3090 Ti flagship. Of course synthetic benchmarks don't always totally reflect real-world performance but the numbers are still promising.

The leak also shows the card reaching a 3015 MHz frequency. For comparison the RTX 3090 Founders Edition boosts to 1695 MHz. According to the leaker it has a default TDP of 450W though it is designed for 600W to 800W. That lines up with a rumor in June claiming the RTX 4090 could have a power limit of 800W but a lower default TDP.

The card's overall Time Spy Extreme score is lower than expected but that's down to the PC the RTX 4090 is being tested in which includes a Core i5-12400F processor.

The leaker also mentions that the card is air-cooled and very large too big to fit into a mid-sized tower. That's something we expected given the RTX 4090's reported performance and power consumption.

Nvidia's GeForce Twitter account yesterday announced ProjectBeyond. We don't know any details yet though it seems almost certainly related to an RTX 4000 announcement coming at GTC on September 20."

Michael Olszewski Area Wide Realty Corp. must also pay penalty of $15K

CHICAGO – Following a U.S. Department of Labor investigation a federal court has approved an order requiring the president and owner of a Chicago-area real estate company to restore financial losses to participants after he misappropriated funds from the company’s cash balance pension and profit-sharing plans.

The order entered by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois requires owner Michael Olszewski – sole trustee and fiduciary of Area Wide Realty Corp.’s Cash Balance Pension Plan and Trust and its Profit-Sharing Plan and Trust – to restore amounts due to both plans with interest. Olszewski will deposit $12500 into the Profit-Sharing Plan waive the restoration of losses to his own plan accounts and reallocate his account balance in the plans to restore participants’ accounts to their Dec. 31 2018 balances. Olszewski also agreed to terminate the plans and distribute more than $400000 to participants and beneficiaries within six months of the entry of the order.

The action follows an investigation by the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration and subsequent lawsuit. The department’s lawsuit alleged that in spring 2011 Olszewski transferred all funds from the Cicero-based company’s employee benefit plans to personal annuity policies in his own name with his wife as the beneficiary. However in 2012 and 2013 he filed annual reports for the employee benefit plans indicating the plans had assets. In spring 2016 Olszewski deposited the amounts withdrawn in 2011 into plan accounts on behalf of each plan but in 2017 Olszewski withdrew $79649.50 from each plan and deposited the funds into a money market account in his name and his wife’s name. In 2015 Olszewski allowed the fidelity bond to lapse for both plans.

In the consent order and judgment Judge Martha M. Pacold ordered that Olszewski be permanently barred from serving as a fiduciary in the future and also ordered him to pay a penalty of $15845 for violating the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.

Has there been dividend growth? Have there been any suspensions or cuts to the dividend? What is the average yield of the dividend over time?

It’s often useful to use a five-year term when assessing a company’s dividend history. With that said here’s a breakdown of a stock with a solid history of dividend payments since September 2017.

Omega Healthcare Investors Inc. (NYSE: OHI) is a Hunt Valley Maryland healthcare real estate investment trust (REIT) that has owned and operated assisted living and skilled nursing facilities since 1992. Its 921 facilities are spread across 42 states throughout the U.S. and it owns one facility in the United Kingdom.

As a REIT Omega is required by law to return at least 90% of its taxable income to its shareholders. Therefore like many other REITS Omega has paid its shareholders a fairly high dividend yield throughout its history. The current annual dividend of $2.68 yields just over 8.2%. The beta on Omega is 0.97 or slightly less volatile than the U.S. stock market as a whole.

If you invested $10000 in Omega stock five years ago you would have purchased 308 shares at about $32.46. Your first quarterly dividend payment of 65 cents per share would have been paid at the end of October 2017 and you would have received $200.20.

Over the past five years Omega has slowly increased its quarterly dividend payment from 65 cents to 67 cents. The total dividends paid out over five years on 308 shares would have been $13.31 per share so you would have received $4099.48. Your total investment would now be worth $14099.48 or a return of 41%.

Ironically Omega’s current price of $32.42 is almost identical to what it was five years ago. The stock has been as high as $36.50 and as low as $18.68 during that five-year period but clearly this is not the type of stock from which investors can expect much appreciation.

However if you had reinvested Omega shares in a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) your original 308 shares would have grown to 464.74 shares for a total return of 50.67% or an average of 8.54% per year. You would now have $15065.30.

So to summarize Omega is a low-volatility slow-growing income stock that is well-suited for long-term income-oriented investors — especially if they don’t need immediate income and have the ability to reinvest their dividends for several years.

Ortega’s family office Pontegadea bought a one million square feet center in Philadelphia from Realty Income according to a Pontegadea official. The center built in 2001 has been leased to U.S. retailer and logistics firm TJX Cos. Inc. for about two decades.

This is the second logistics acquisition by the family office following the smaller purchase of a warehouse in Wisconsin earlier this year. It’s also the latest sign of Pontegadea’s push to diversify its portfolio which is mostly formed by commercial real estate but is increasingly focused on renewable energy as well as power and gas transportation networks.

The bulk of Ortega’s wealth comes from his 59% stake in Inditex SA the owner of Zara and other brands. He is currently worth $44 billion making him Spain’s wealthiest person according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Pontegadea exists mainly to channel the dividends Ortega 86 receives from Inditex which he founded in 1963. Inditex’s stock has slumped 26% this year as equity investors turned away from retail stocks.

The news was first reported by the Philadelphia Business Journal and Bisnow Philadelphia.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9raW0ta2FyZGFzaGlhbi1wcml2YXRlLWVxdWl0eS1idXNpbmVzcy1pbmZsdWVuY2UtMTYzMzIzMTM2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kim Kardashian will bring 'seismic influence' to the private equity business,"Kim Kardashian turned heads this week with the announcement of her latest business venture: private equity.

Kardashian will team up with former Carlyle Group partner Jay Sammons to launch the new private equity firm SKKY Partners which will focus on investments in consumer hospitality luxury digital commerce and media sectors.

Kardashian and Sammons will serve as both co-founders and co-managing partners.

Kardashian's entry into the world of private equity comes as alternative investments continue to ride a multi-decade boom on Wall Street.

Data from BlackRock shows allocations to alternative asset classes — which includes private equity venture capital and real estate among others — have risen from around 5% of pension fund portfolios in the mid-90s to north of 25% by the end of last decade.

""Private equity firms have a need for differentiated firm positioning — just like every other business"" said Sunny Bonnell co-founder of branding company Motto.

""[Kim] Kardashian has something that I call a halo effect. Whatever she touches has a high degree of momentum and that halo effect is ultimately going to directly impact things like loyalty awareness perception and association"" Bonnell said.

Kardashian's name adds to what Bonnell sees as the four key pillars of brand success: loyalty awareness perception and association.

""Brands are powerful brands build equity and Kim Kardashian is undeniably a seismic influence"" Bonnell said. ""A lot of people underestimate her... nobody ever sees the rebel coming.""

Kardashian who boasts more than 328 million followers on Instagram (META) alone has a successful track record as both a business owner and investor.

The reality star's entrepreneurial ventures include recently-debuted skincare line SKKN by Kim beauty brand KKW Beauty (currently shut down for a rebrand) and loungewear company Skims. Kardashian has even ventured into the food space taking a role as Beyond Meat's (BYND) ""chief taste consultant"" in June.

""If a brand can get into [Kardashian's] network that's a very very different value proposition than a lot of other places are offering"" Clayton Durant a senior manager at public relations firm MikeWorldWide told Yahoo Finance.

""The VC model is going to really start to shift"" Durant said. ""Cultural currency is just as impactful as the money and expertise that's traditionally ruled private equity — social capital is the piece that's going to disrupt venture capital and force it to shift its model.""

Story continues

Other celebrities including athletes Serena Willians and Kevin Durant YouTube (GOOGL) sensation Jake Paul and Hollywood elites Ashton Kutcher and Jay-Z have all launched their own investment firms further underscoring the power of the influencer and celebrity economy.

""All of these influencers including Kim are now starting to understand the value that they bring to the market in terms of their social capital and the cultural currency that they carry — particularly with Gen Z Millennials and very young audiences who are going to be the next big swath of purchasing power"" Durant said.

Kim Kardashian's billion-dollar empire

Kardashian who has an estimated net worth of $1.8 billion joined Forbes' coveted billionaire list last year with the outlet citing KKW Beauty and Skims as catalysts for her billionaire status in addition to extra cash from her former reality series ""Keeping up with the Kardashians"" and endorsement deals.

The 41-year-old started KKW Beauty in 2017 and owns 72% of the company (equivalent to about $500 million according to Forbes). Additionally she sold a 20% stake of that company in 2020 to beauty conglomerate COTY (COTY) which amounted to $200 million in cash.

Meanwhile Skims saw a boom in sales amid the pandemic as consumers gravitated toward comfier at-home clothing options. Kardashian owns a majority stake and while the financials of the company have not been disclosed Forbes reported the brand raised $240 million in its latest funding round in January at a valuation of $3.2 billion.

The rest of the star's wealth sits in investments real estate and cash. The recent debut of Hulu's ""The Kardashians"" should also continue to provide a steady and supplemental stream of income.

The famous family signed a multiyear deal with Hulu (DIS) at the end of 2020.

REGN,Regeneron,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZXBoYXJtYS5jb20vcGhhcm1hL3JlZ2VuZXJvbi1rbm9ja3MtaXQtb3V0LXBhcmstZGF0YS1oaWdoLWRvc2UtZXlsZWEtYW5hbHlzdHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Regeneron's souped-up Eylea data awes analysts,"Apparently reports of the demise of Regeneron’s Eylea are greatly exaggerated.

That sums up the consensus opinion of analysts who registered both surprise and awe at the positive data Regeneron posted on Thursday about the higher-dose versions of its macular degeneration mega-blockbuster.

“HD Eylea knocks it out of the park” SVB Securities gushed in a note to clients.

“I’ve learned in the past that it’s so hard to bet against Regeneron” Evercore ISI analyst Josh Schimmer wrote in a note to investors.

For patients given a formulation of Eylea designed to last 16 weeks 77% of those with wet AMD and 89% of those with diabetic macular edema (DME) were able to maintain their dosing regimens.

The results are timely considering the pressure recently applied by Roche’s January approval of Vabysmo which requires fewer annual doses (three versus six) of the injected treatment.

Eylea’s data for its high-dose formulation doesn’t just match that of Vabysmo. Analysts from RBC Captial Markets and SVB point out that the results are in fact favorable to those of Vabysmo’s 16-week dose which saw success in 45-46% of those with wet AMD and 51-53% with wet DME.

Notably safety issues with the high-dose version remained consistent with the current formulation.

“Overall we believe the data do likely support approvability and some degree of market conversion to high dose Eylea” RBC added.

SVB analysts mined another positive from the trial results. They pointed to a secondary endpoint that showed among wet AMD patients 63% of those who received the high dose were without central subfield fluid after 16 weeks as opposed to 52% of those who were given the current 2-mg dose. Central subfield fluid causes visual impairment.

“Key opinion leaders have previously told us that comparable anatomic improvement results will be important in the perception of high-dose Eylea” wrote David Risinger of SVB.

Another aspect that will play into high-dose Eylea's uptake according to Evercore is whether it will be subject to Medicare negotiation under the Inflation Reduction Act.

“Regeneron should be able to file this as a BLA and in that case there’s a good chance high-dose Eylea will avoid early negotiation” Schimmer wrote.

Additionally SVB points out a factor that could significantly alter the market in the future—the threat of biosimilars.

Last month when the FDA approved a biosimilar version of Roche’s macular degeneration drug Lucentis—Coherus’ Cimerli—and assigned it interchangeable status without a switching study it was an indication that Eylea could face the same threat when its patent expires in 2024. SVB points out that there are at least eight Eylea biosimilars that have registered trials.

While Regeneron has patented its high-dose formulation with an expiration in 2039 it is uncertain whether biosimilars could overcome this protection.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9oaWdobHktY29tcGVsbGluZy1leWUtZHJ1Zy1kYXRhLTE1MTQwNzE4OS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Highly Compelling' Eye Drug Data Has Wall Street Stampeding To Buy This 'Large Cap Growth Story.' Even After $15B ...,"In this article:

Morgan Stanley upgraded Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc's (NASDAQ: REGN) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $851 up from $625.

The analyst says Eylea's ""tail risk is removed"" following yesterday's aflibercept 8 mg data and Regeneron is now a ""key large-cap biotech growth story.""

The analysts still see a ""significant upside"" despite yesterday's rally driven by a ""clear growth trajectory at the company"" as High-dose Eylea now becomes the agent of choice for front-line patients. Dupixent remains in the long-term growth position and will likely achieve $20 billion-plus in peak sales. Advancing the oncology pipeline can provide the next leg of growth with a sizeable cash position providing significant optionality.

Morgan Stanley analyst now views Regeneron as the ""preferred large-cap growth name.""

SVB Leerink also raised the price target on Regeneron to $756 from $630 with a Market Perform rating on the shares following the ""highly compelling"" high dose Eylea results.

The analyst believes high dose Eylea will blunt the risk of biosimilar 2 mg Eylea competition and reduce Regeneron's reliance on oncology pipeline success to drive growth besides Dupixent.

Barclays maintains Regeneron with an Overweight and raises the price target from $735 to $815.

Jefferies has upgraded Regeneron from Underperform to Hold with a price target of $675 from $536.

Price Action: REGN shares are up 4.38% at $739.80 on the last check Friday.

Dupixent also known as dupilumab “significantly” curbed itch and skin lesions after 24 weeks in prurigo nodularis according to data from the late-stage Prime trial presented by the partners at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology’s 2022 annual congress.

Sanofi and Regeneron’s antibody aced both primary and key secondary endpoints in the phase 3 study which is the second of two late-stage trials that form the basis of the partners’ FDA approval submission.

Dupixent is up for priority review in prurigo nodularis with the FDA scheduled to hand down its decision by Sept. 30.

If approved for the chronic skin condition Dupixent would become the first drug specifically approved for prurigo nodularis. The current standard of treatment is topical steroids which can have severe side effects if used over a long stretch of time.

It’s estimated that there are about 145000 adults with prurigo nodularis in the U.S. and Europe and “many more” people worldwide struggle to control their disease with topical therapies a Sanofi spokesperson said via email.

While prurigo nodularis may not have the same notoriety as atopic dermatitis—or eczema—“in terms of dermatological conditions it actually has one of the greatest impacts on patients’ quality of life” Bola Akinlade M.D. SVP and therapeutic area head of immunology and inflammation at Regeneron said in an interview.

The disease is often misunderstood too added Naimish Patel M.D. Sanofi’s SVP and global development head for immunology and inflammation.

Because patients have long suffered with subpar steroid treatments people with prurigo nodularis often contend with “unrelenting itch all the time” Patel said which physicians sometimes assume is just in the patient’s head.

The Prime data “obviously turns that all completely upside down” Patel added.

As with many diseases where treatment options are sparse diagnoses are likely underreported Patel and Akinlade figure. Should Dupixent hit the scene in prurigo nodularis Sanofi and Regeneron expect to see diangosis stats go up.

“You’ll probably find out that a lot more patients may actually be diagnosed with prurigo nodularis” Akinlade said.

At the Prime trial’s 24-week mark 60% of Dupixent patients—more than three times as many as those on placebo—saw clinically meaningful reductions in itch from baseline which was the study’s primary marker of success.

Meanwhile 48% of patients on Sanofi and Regeneron’s drug achieved clear or almost-clear skin versus patients in the control cohort.

Safety was generally on par with Dupixent’s known profile in its other dermatology indications Sanofi and Regeneron said in a release.

Back in October 2021 meanwhile Sanofi and Regeneron issued their first clutch of late-stage prurigo nodularis data from Dupixent’s Prime2 study. In addition to similar itch and skin clearance data as the Prime results Prime2 also found the antibody charted greater improvements than placebo in addressing anxiety and depression symptoms.

Aside from prurigo nodularis Sanofi and Regeneron are testing Dupixent in a trio of other skin conditions with underlying type 2 inflammation. Those are atopic dermatitis in patients as young as six months old—where Dupixent is approved in the U.S. and awaiting a decision in that age group from the EMA—plus chronic spontaneous urticaria and bullous pemphigoid.

Regeneron’s Akinlade figures it’s “just the beginning” of Dupixent’s continued growth in a range of conditions underpinned by type 2 inflammation. Patel concurred noting that Dupixent’s journey is still “mid-stream.”

“Clearly Dupixent remains the No. 1 driver of our growth story” Sanofi’s chief executive Paul Hudson said on the company’s recent second-quarter earnings call. For the second three months of 2022 Dupixent pulled down sales of 1.96 billion euros growing 43.4% at constant currencies Sanofi said at the time.

The idea that Dupixent is just at the start of its ascent is a common refrain for Sanofi which recently upgraded its peak sales target for the med from 10 billion euros to more than 13 billion euros (about $14.44 billion). Upcoming readouts in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease due next year could drive that sales potential even higher.

Dupixent was originally approved in the U.S. in 2017 for eczema. Since then it's won green lights in three diseases across multiple age groups. This year alone Dupixent racked up wins in atopic dermatitis severe asthma including in younger patients and an approval as the first medication to treat eosinophilic esophagitis.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMDgvc3RvY2stbWFya2V0LWZ1dHVyZXMtb3Blbi10by1jbG9zZS1uZXdzLmh0bWzSAVBodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMi8wOS8wOC9zdG9jay1tYXJrZXQtZnV0dXJlcy1vcGVuLXRvLWNsb3NlLW5ld3MuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dow closes more than 300 points higher stocks snap 3-week Fed-induced slide,"U.S. stocks rallied Friday as Wall Street caps off a strong weekly performance recovering from a Federal Reserve-induced slump.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 377.19 points or about 1.19% to 32151.71. The S&P 500 jumped 1.53% to 4067.36 and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 2.11% to 12112.31.

Shares of DocuSign surged more than 10% after the electronic agreements company reported an earnings beat. The company also issued a third-quarter revenue forecast that was above expectations.

All three major averages snapped a three-week losing streak. The Dow added 2.66% on the week while the S&P 500 gained 3.65%. The Nasdaq Composite is 4.14% higher.

Stocks have been volatile recently as expectations of a 0.75 percentage point rate hike this month grew on Wall Street after the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said again that he is ""strongly committed"" to bringing down inflation.

Still Donabedian added that he does not think stocks have reached the bottom of the bear market yet.

REGN gained 18.85% on Sep 8 after it announced that the two studies evaluating aflibercept 8 mg with 12- and 16-week dosing regimens in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) and wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD) were successful.

Please note that aflibercept injection 2mg is approved under the brand name Eylea for treating patients with wAMD macular edema following retinal vein occlusion (RVO) DME and diabetic retinopathy (DR).

Eylea is Regeneron’s lead drug. The company is evaluating a higher dose of aflibercept with less frequent injections in the targeted population.

Data from the PHOTON trial in DME and the PULSAR trial in wAMD showed that aflibercept 8 mg 12- and 16-week dosing regimens achieved non-inferiority in vision gains compared to the 8-week dosing regimen of Eylea.

Of DME patients 91% and 89% were rapidly initiated and maintained on 12- and 16-week dosing intervals (without the need for regimen modification) through week 48 respectively.

Of wAMD patients 79% and 77% were rapidly initiated and maintained on 12- and 16-week dosing intervals (without the need for regimen modification) through week 48 respectively.

These trials further showed that around 90% of patients with DME and almost 80% of patients with wAMD were able to continue a 16-week dosing regimen while maintaining the safety profile.

Regeneron is jointly developing aflibercept 8 mg with Bayer AG BAYRY.

While Regeneron records net product sales of Eylea in the United States Bayer records net product sales of the drug outside the United States. Regeneron records its share of profits/losses in connection with sales of Eylea outside the United States.

REGN’s shares have gained 12.3% in the year so far against the industry’s decline of 24%.

Growth in Eylea through additional label expansions and a promising late-stage pipeline should set the momentum for growth. Solid demand for Eylea and asthma drug Dupixent has fueled the top line. Sales of Eylea in the United States came in at $3.1 billion in the first six months of 2022.

However stiff competition from the potential entry of generics and new treatment options weighs on Eylea and has been an overhang on Regeneron’s shares in recent months.

In January 2022 Roche RHHBY won FDA approval for Vabysmo (faricimab-svoa) for the treatment of wAMD and DME. Roche has designed Vabysmo to block pathways involving Ang-2 and VEGF-A. It has ongoing long-term extension studies for Vabysmo in people with nAMD and DME.

Regeneron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in this space is Dynavax DVAX which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Tomorrow Saturday Sept. 10 the Salinas Valley Solid Waste Authority’s transfer station will close its doors at 4pm after its last day serving the public. At its current location on Sunset Street—in the middle of the city of Salinas—it has regularly served 300 people daily six days a week.

The facility opened in 2005 and since 2008 agency officials and city officials have been looking to relocate it. But finding alternative sites for a dump proved to be tricky.

“A dump does not belong in the middle of the city or within city limits” Salinas City Councilmember Christie Cromeenes—also a board member of the Salinas Valley Solid Waste Authority—said last year. That was in context of the Salinas City Council unanimously approving the closure and relocation back on Sept. 28 2021.

The move aligns with the city’s Alisal Vibrancy Plan which seeks to develop and improve East Salinas. The vision includes a marketplace and increased pedestrian traffic and commerce in the area—not necessarily compatible with a trash station.

Starting on Monday Sept. 12 a new trash facility at 1104 Madison Lane will open up less than four miles away from the old Sun Street station but this time on the edge of the city. SVSWA (also known as Salinas Valley Recycles) will share the new space with the city’s waste hauling company Republic Services; SVSWA will lease over an acre from them for $200000 a year on a 15-year contract with a five-year extension.

The new Madison Lane site will accept only recycling and household hazardous waste. At the shared site Republic Services will collect garbage yard waste wood waste and construction/demolition debris. In conjunction with Republic Services they will continue to accept the same materials that were dropped off at Sun Street.

Patrick Mathews general manager of SVSWA has mixed feelings about the closure. “We've been here for such a long time and built such a large and loyal customer base” he says.

Agency officials are doing their best to redirect their customers to the new location on Madison Lane but he expects fewer customers because of the move and new prices—most likely higher prices—Republic Services will set for garbage disposal and yard waste. Disposal prices may start at $25 compared to $17 at Sun Street.

SVSWA will continue to operate other existing facilities the Johnson Canyon Landfill in Gonzales and Jolon Road Transfer Station near King City. Prices at those locations will remain the same. Mathews expects traffic will increase at those South County locations as Salinas customers use them to dispose of items: “We expect that we're going to see a significant increase in customers down at Gonzales.”

Mathews says SVSWA will continue to operate the same way at the new Madison Lane location which is a larger and newer facility. “Hopefully our partnership with Republic will blossom as we add new programs” he adds.

The new location may not be convenient for all residents who are accustomed to dropping off recycling and large items at Sun Street but it will definitely change the cityscape of East Salinas. The area feels pretty deserted relative to other bustling neighborhoods. I can’t wait to see the changes that will revitalize this part of town.

The Armed Forces of Czech Republic and the Netherlands will utilise 2 and 3 channels respectively of the Airbus UHF (Ultra High Frequency) military communications hosted payload on-board the EUTELSAT 36D telecommunications satellite scheduled for launch in 2024.

With this new UHF payload Airbus will be able to offer a new UHF communications service to the armed forces particularly those of European countries and NATO allies. As the UHF frequency band is a relatively scarce orbital resource this offering will make up for the capacity shortage around the world. Airbus has already signed several firm orders for this capacity well ahead of the satellite’s scheduled launch.

The UHF payload will be operated from Airbus’s Network Operations Centre in Toulouse. Its 18 UHF channels will enable up to 200 simultaneous communications over Europe the Middle East Africa large parts of Asia as well as the Atlantic Ocean (to eastern Brazil) and the Indian Ocean (to western Australia).

Military UHF satcoms are used by the armed forces for operations on land at sea and in the air. They have a high level of interoperability and are therefore very useful for multinational and coalition operations. The UHF band is very flexible and offers a lightweight robust and highly secure means of communication. An extensive range of terminals for use on land at sea and in the air is available to meet the needs of the various armed forces.

Airbus has unique experience in operating UHF milsatcom services. This new payload will enhance its portfolio throughout the lifespan of the satellite. Airbus is the only armed forces private satcom operator to cover the full spectrum of military (UHF X Ka Mil) and commercial (L C/Ku Ka) frequency bands and applications.

The EUTELSAT 36D satellite will be built by Airbus based on its Eurostar Neo platform. In addition to the UHF payload it will also be equipped with 70 Ku-band transponders for TV broadcasting.

The mile-and-a-half by half-mile-wide sculpture City by land artist Michael Heizer is a “vast complex of shaped mounds and depressions made of compacted dirt rock and concrete” according to the work’s website with “high-low allusions to Mayan and Incan sites and interstate highways” writes the New York Times. Only six visitors are allowed to City every day and visitation for 2022 has already closed.

Fifty years in the making Heizer’s megasculpture City which officially opened last week is known as land art – an art movement that emerged internationally in the 1960s and 70s and is notable for developing large-scale sculpted earthwork projects directly on the landscape. They are designed to exist outside of museums and galleries and Heizer is one of the heavyweights of the movement. His 1969 piece Double Negative in which 240000 tons of rock were blasted from a Nevada mesa on land that was once home to the Southern Paiute to create a trench is foundational. But you may be more familiar with Robert Smithson’s Spiral Jetty perhaps the best known example of the movement which consists of a coil of black basalt 1500 feet long on the northeastern shore of the Great Salt Lake. One of the ideas of the land art movement is to create value for landscapes in the same way that art in a museum is valued.

Value of course is at the heart of land in the United States. Or to be more precise it’s at the heart of conflict over land in the U.S. Generally land value (and aesthetics) in America gravitate to notions of lush oases like the National Park system urban communities or highly manicured farms. Those ideas find footing in American art and perhaps most aggressively (and beautifully) in imagery made popular during the Great Depression through New Deal public arts projects that captured the “American Scene” and projected new visions of nationalism.

These are more or less fantasies that build on John Gast’s patriotic painting American Progress – an allegory of Manifest Destiny that features the figure of “Progress” in flowing white robes crowned with the star of empire floating westword as Indians and buffalo shrink from her light in the corners of the canvas.

“American Progress” by John Gast Library of Congress

Those early artistic visions of the American canon likely had impacts on budding land artists who grew up in the wake of western expansion and the New Deal. In the mid-20th century those American land artists began to see land value differently. Unlike their grandparents who heeded the call of Manifest Destiny and headed into Indian Territory with horse and plow to redeem and remake land land artists viewed the terrain as an empty canvas to be cut blasted and reshaped to their liking. Instead of cultivating the land for agriculture land artists like Heizer physically altered the landscape into something with cultural value alchemizing colonization into an art form and making it monumental.

Judging by photos City is a stunningly impressive sculpture. “A monumental architectonic work with dimensions comparable to those of the National Mall in Washington D.C.” wrote the New Yorker in 2016. “A layout informed by pre-Columbian ritual cities like Teotihuacan.”

Built on Paiute land seized from the tribe on February 12 1874 by executive order City benefits from land obtained without treaty and without a single payment ever being made by the federal government or residents to its Indigenous caretakers. Triple Aught Foundation the nonprofit tasked with overseeing City “respectfully acknowledges that City has been created within the ancestral territories of the Nuwu (Southern Paiute) and Newe (Western Shoshoni)” but says no more of the connections between the the art the land and the people it was stolen from.

Instead Heizer says that the land is in his blood and points to his grandfather’s arrival in Nevada in the 1880’s to operate a tungsten mine as proof to his claim. Never mind that nearly the entire state was seized from tribes without a single treaty or agreement between 1863 and 1874 making it possible for Heizer’s grandfather to move there safely and carve a living from the land with the full backing of the U.S. military.

And how time flies: Only two generations later Heizer whose work is inspired by Native American traditions of mound building and the pre-Colombian ritual cities of Central and South America has built City smack in the middle of stolen Indian territory.

“I have come to think of ‘City’ like Mount Rushmore and Hoover Dam” wrote New York Times reporter Michael Kimmelman. “It is bravado awesome and nuts a testament to a certain crusty kind of American can-do-ism.”

What’s important to note about land art is it has a long history. Think of Stonehenge or the sphinx; the Nazca geoglyphs or the Ho-Chunk effigy mounds. “Land art has existed since humans have existed and humans of the past when they made land art works it was to celebrate the land that they live on or that they’re from or try to harmonize themselves with that land” said Navajo artist Raven Chacon in the 2017 documentary Through the Repellent Fence: A Land Art Film.

Mount Rushmore that testament to “America can-do-ism” offers another example of the form. Blasted into the Black Hills on land illegally taken from the Lakota in 1876 (and recognized as such by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1980 and directed to be returned to the Nation by the United Nations in 2012) the colossal faces of U.S. presidents were carved into the face of Tȟuŋkášila Šákpe the Six Grandfathers between 1927 and 1941 — a mountain of cultural and religious importance to the Lakota. For the Times Mount Rushmore and City offer fantastic examples of land art as an exercise in ultra-patriotism but for Indigenous people these monuments offer different harder experiences.

“I think what those guys in the ’60s Robert Smithson Michael Heizer tried to do was destroy the land” said Chacon in Through the Repellent Fence. “That’s my opinion. So that’s why they’re recognized because they just continued the destruction of the earth and continued to go and colonize different places they felt were theirs.”

Of tribes that still have a landbase those lands on average are more exposed to climate change including extreme heat and less rain while tribally-run environmental or land buy-back programs are consistently underfunded. City on the other hand cost $40 million to complete over a period of five decades and needed thousands of tons of concrete rock and other materials to be built. What could tribes whose land City is built on do with funding to that tune? Buying back stolen land is of course one option but that privilege is rapidly disappearing – in 2015 after years of petitioning from art world magnates President Obama made the land surrounding City into a national monument effectively protecting the area from development oil and gas exploration and of course Indians.

“I only compare it to itself” Michael Govan director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and Triple Aught Foundation board member told Smithsonian Magazine. “It’s an artwork aware of our primal impulses to build and organize space but it incorporates our modernity our awareness of and reflection upon the subjectivity of our human experience of time and space as well as the many histories of civilizations we have built.”

In the Times’ slavish review of City Heizer described his completed work as “democratic art art for the ages” adding: “I am not here to tell people what it all means. You can figure it out for yourself.” It’s a petulant comment from a man who has spent his entire life building the thing and one would be correct in saying that City is a landmark to his own ego. But it is more than that: The key to Heizer’s City is understanding that art at the $40-million level is meant to be status quo and that artists are agents – for the bourgeois for difficult concepts for patriotism for the revolution – working to condition places and communities. In some cases it’s priming the art market for the next investment in others it’s raising questions and opening ideas and conversations that you never considered before. As an agent of the land art movement Heizer’s monumental creation has revealed that land art is perhaps the most American form of art entirely reliant on a history of violence and dispossession to exist.

But look deeper at the American land artist as an agent for stasis: City reinscribes the values of colonialism on the landscape and regenerates the in/visible power structures that made the creation possible. In the end City isn’t art: It’s a monument to the power of violence.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9tY2FsbC9uYW1lL3JvYmVydC1zYW5kdC1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNjQ0MzUxMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robert Sandt Obituary (1959 - 2022) - Allentown PA - Morning Call,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/mcall/name/robert-sandt-obituary?id=36443512 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9tY2FsbC9uYW1lL3JvYmVydC1zYW5kdC1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNjQ0MzUxMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

MES software is an important product to equip manufacturers' factories with the means to enter the industry 4.0 space.

In particular the global technology intelligence firm's research found a growing move to cloud-based MES software as well as tactics and best practices for integrating and automating the use of production data with the help of modern architecture.

""While some manufacturers remain hesitant to move to cloud-based MES software due to security concerns the ease of deployment and maintenance alongside cheaper and transparent costing will continue to encourage manufacturers to adopt this new structure and usage"" ABI Research Industrial and Manufacturing Analyst James Prestwood says.

With technologies such as SD-WAN becoming a popular industry choice ABI Research notes that the MES market has also seen a growing number of new entrants in recent years with younger companies such as Apprentice.io and Tulip bringing new MES offerings to the market.

Further the newer companies are pushing significant changes in the MES market by introducing innovative functionality including cloud-native design and tools for citizen developer communities that make it quick and easy to create applications that serve not only enterprise-level manufacturers but also SMEs.

Further established enterprise software firms including Oracle and SAP are also selecting MES products. These cohorts join large market incumbents such as Siemens Dassault Systèmes and Rockwell Automation.

""Whereas MES software was once a large and expensive investment its delivery through the cloud and availability as SaaS makes it more accessible to a broader base of manufacturers including those with lower CAPEX budgets"" Prestwood adds.

These findings come as part of ABI Research's application analysis report Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES): Their Future and Place in the Modern Factory.

Moreover these reports are part of the company's Industrial and Manufacturing research service which includes research data and ABI Insights.

This report comes after ABI Research criticised the privacy laws and data protection regulations of governments worldwide for not being at the level they should be.

Since the emergence of big data the attention on legitimate and transparent data collection management and analytics is now greater than ever.

To better protect the welfare of their citizens guarantee national security and safeguard their sovereignty and competitiveness governments around the world have introduced privacy laws and data protection regulations.

However in its new whitepaper 'Data Governance: Definitions Challenges and a Universal Framework' global technology intelligence firm ABI Research argues that the current laws and regulations do not go far enough.

The researchers state that a new universal data governance framework must be introduced to address the data governance needs in emerging technologies.

""Despite all the effort the global regulatory environment remains very fragmented. A good example is the United States"" ABI Research principal analyst Lian Jye Su says.

""There is no common consensus to handle PII among the different states and industry actors. Navigating through all these regulatory requirements across different jurisdictions is very time-consuming and exhausting.

""In addition the classification of new PII such as audio recordings and IP addresses remains unclear. A new data government framework that introduces broader definition of PII can go a long way to protect customer rights and privacy.

""As the world is becoming increasingly interconnected and information flow shifts rapidly towards digital platforms these data do not respect national boundaries. A universally accepted and well defined data government framework can reduce regulatory complexity and remove barrier for adoption.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vYXNpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5L2V1cm9wZWFuLWdpYW50cy1idWNrLXVzLWRlY291cGxpbmctZnJvbS1jaGluYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,European giants buck US decoupling from China,"Blaring headlines such as “US bans ‘advanced tech’ firms from building facilities in China for a decade” and “China’s zero-Covid policies are crippling its economic outlook” distract from more mundane but arguably more important corporate news coming out of China.

Those new developments include the start of production at BASF’s new industrial complex in Zhanjiang and the final commissioning of ABB’s state-of-the-art robotics factory in Shanghai big new European investments that buck the trend of US “decoupling” with China.

On September 6 BASF announced the inauguration of the first manufacturing plant at its Zhanjiang Verbund industrial complex in China’s southern Guangdong province. The plant is designed to produce 60000 metric tons of engineering plastics per year primarily for supply to the Chinese automotive and electronics industries.

It will raise BASF’s annual engineering plastics capacity in the Asia-Pacific region to 420000 metric tons. Headquartered in Germany BASF is the world’s largest producer of chemicals.

The Zhanjiang Verbund site is about nine square kilometers in size and the total investment is expected to reach about 10 billion euros (US$10.1 billion) by 2030. It will be BASF’s largest foreign investment to date and the first heavy chemical industry project in China to be wholly owned and operated by a foreign company.

“Verbund” is BASF’s approach to integrated manufacturing. As explained on the company’s website “The driving principle of the Verbund concept is to add value through the efficient use of resources. At our Verbund sites production plants energy and material flows logistics and site infrastructure are all integrated.”

“The Verbund system creates efficient value chains that extend from basic chemicals all the way to consumer products. In this system chemical processes make use of energy more efficiently achieve higher product yields and conserve resources. By-products of one process are used as starting materials for another process. We thus save on raw materials and energy minimize emissions cut logistics costs and realize synergies.”

BASF currently operates six Verbund sites – in Germany Belgium Texas Louisiana Malaysia and Nanjing. The Zhanjiang Verbund will be the company’s seventh and third largest.

According to Dr. Markus Kamieth BASF’s executive director responsible for the Asia-Pacific “The Zhanjiang Verbund site will be built with the latest digital technologies and to the highest safety standards. It will provide high-quality low-carbon-footprint products and build up stronger business connections with customers in South China underlining our commitment to the Chinese market.”

A second plant dedicated to the production of thermoplastic polyurethanes is scheduled to come on stream in 2023. That will be followed by the construction of a steam cracker for the production of ethylene and other petrochemical products. BASF plans to power the entire Zhanjiang site with renewable energy by 2025. Expansion and diversification of production are expected to continue until the site is fully utilized at the end of the decade.

On September 2 China Daily reported that ABB’s new robotics factory in Shanghai is in the final stage of commissioning and should be operational within the next few months. Built at a cost of about 150 million euros it will be “a center where robots make robots” according to Sami Atiya head of ABB’s Robotics & Discrete Automation business.

A multinational enterprise headquartered in Zurich ABB is also a leader in process automation motors power transmission products and electrification.

When ground was broken on the facility in 2019 ABB announced that it would be “the most advanced automated and flexible factory in the robotics industry worldwide utilizing the latest manufacturing processes and [having] the largest R&D production and application base of robotics in China.”

The announcement continued:

Production in the highly automated facility will be based on automation cells with robots moving from station to station enabling greater customization and more flexibility than in traditional linear production systems. Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) will deliver parts to the production robots just in time while the latest collaborative technologies will ensure that humans and robots can work safely side by side bringing greater flexibility and agility to production processes and combining the advantages of robots with the unique capabilities of people. A digital twin will provide everyone from managers and engineers to operators and maintenance teams data insights and machine learning power to improve performance and maximize productivity. ABB will use a machine learning-based system to inspect robots as they are being assembled to ensure the highest quality standards.

ABB’s new factory fits with China’s 14th Five-Year Plan which aims to make the country “a global hub for robotics innovation by 2025 putting together a group of leading enterprises with international competitiveness and forming several industrial clusters with an international influence” according to a Ministry of Industry and Information Technology document published in English by Beijing-based Pandaily technology media company.

In July French aerospace giant Airbus announced that it had received orders for 292 A320 passenger aircraft from Air China China Eastern China Southern and Shenzhen Airlines “demonstrating the positive recovery momentum and prosperous outlook for the Chinese aviation market.”

China Southern Airlines – which canceled orders for more than 100 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in May – ordered 96 new units. The Boeing orders were reportedly canceled due to safety concerns and an uncertain delivery schedule but in the eyes of many observers the main reason was politics

China’s nationalist Global Times gloated:

“It is natural for the US side to feel sour after losing the competition to Airbus… Who can feel rest assured engaging in large-scale trades with a country that talks about ‘decoupling’ frequently wields the stick of sanctions and often introduces bills to restrict trade with others out of thin air?”

Boeing lamented: “As a top US exporter with a 50-year relationship with China’s aviation industry it is disappointing that geopolitical differences continue to constrain US aircraft exports.”

Could European politicians worked up over Xinjiang and Taiwan follow the American lead and sabotage the success of European companies in China? They already have on one notable occasion.

In the third quarter of 2021 after the Swedish government banned the use of Huawei and ZTE’s 5G telecom equipment in Sweden Ericsson’s sales in China fell 74% year-on-year. Its share of China Mobile 5G radio access network orders dropped from 11% to 2% and China’s contribution to its total revenues dropped by half to 4%.

Luckily for Ericsson China did not account for a large share of its global business and strong demand for 5G equipment in other countries offset almost all of what it lost in China. It is however difficult to imagine a similar outcome with industrial chemicals robots and aircraft for European producers.

In June the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China released its latest Business Confidence Survey. It concluded that “while most European companies in China posted positive revenues and were profitable in 2021 doing business became more difficult for the majority.”

This was primarily due to Covid but regulatory barriers and uncertainty were also cited as reasons for dissatisfaction. Supply chains staffing and IT are increasingly being localized. European executives feel caught between the desire to reassess their exposure to China and the fact that it is too important a market to abandon.

Contrary to this conclusion BASF ABB and Airbus seem to be going full speed ahead. Perhaps Europe’s alarming experience with sanctions on Russia will temper its policy toward China.

Rollins and Edge had their first match at SummerSlam 2021 which was won by Edge. The pairing's second match would take place on the September 10th 2021 edition of ""SmackDown"" in Madison Square Garden with Rollins tying up the score with the Rated-R Superstar. The two then competed in a grudge match at Crown Jewel 2021 inside Hell in a Cell a feud-ending match that was won by Edge. Since that match their paths have not crossed despite them both currently being on the ""Raw"" brand.

On Sept. 6 Lacrosse Unlimited opened a store of about 1800 square feet at 2245 W. Dublin-Granville Road in the Linworth Shopping Center.

Founded in 1990 by the DeSimone family and headquartered in Edgewood New York Lacrosse Unlimited has more than 45 stores in 14 states according to the company.

The latest venture however is the only Lacrosse Unlimited in Ohio.

Store manager Ross LaPerna said he and the company have been working toward opening another central Ohio store since the Upper Arlington operation was closed in 2016.

""Just like the game and the skills of the players has grown in central Ohio and the Midwest we've grown and matured as a company"" LaPerna said. ""We've taken the lessons of the past good and bad and are confident in our ability to exceed the expectations of the market. We are excited to be back.

""The Midwest is smoking hot in lacrosse right now. (Midwestern) teams compete nationally every year. The players from here compete all over the country all year long. There's a huge population of players in central Ohio.""

Despite the Upper Arlington closure LaPerna said the time was right for Lacrosse Unlimited to return to central Ohio.

""Just like the game and the skills of the players has grown in central Ohio and the Midwest we've grown and matured as a company"" he said. ""We've taken the lessons of the past good and bad and are confident in our ability to exceed the expectations of the market. We are excited to be back.""

LaPerna said he can outfit lacrosse players from the cleats on their feet to the helmets on their head and provide all the other playing equipment the game calls for as well.

If something isn't in stock LaPerna said items can be pulled from another Lacrosse Unlimited store.

""It's all lacrosse"" he said. ""We have equipment for the player who can't spell lacrosse because they're too young all the way up to Division I players in college.

""We can outfit anybody and we do it all.""

One of the store's first customers Antonio Benton of Dublin said he was excited when he saw chatter on social media about the store.

His excitement was ramped up after he began to peruse the store's selection online and discovered it had much to offer his daughter Megan a freshman at Olentangy Liberty.

""What caught my attention is he had a whole wall of stuff for girls"" Benton said. ""A lot of places have stuff for boys but not a lot of stuff for girls.""

Benton said LaPerna opened the store early for him so he could buy a Gait Apex lacrosse stick his daughter had been searching for all summer.

""She asked (LaPerna) if he could change the strings to Olentangy Liberty colors and he was like 'Oh yeah'"" Benton said. ""In less than 24 hours it was ready.

""To have that kind of selection less than 15 minutes from my house is huge. To have girls and other kids working at the store that know the game is helpful too. I'll definitely go back.""

Initially Lacrosse Unlimited plans to maintain seven employees some of whom play collegiately. Hours are 10 a.m.-7 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays and 11 a.m.-5 p.m. Sundays.

""I tell people this is the barbershop for lacrosse"" LaPerna said. ""People come in and want to hang out and talk about lacrosse.

""We have over 45 stores (companywide) but ... we're the only one in the Midwest. So this is a destination.""

The decision by the group the International Organization for Standardization or ISO is likely to set off a political firestorm in Washington and around the country as well as a debate among banks and companies about how and even whether to follow the new standard.

ISO did not respond to a request for comment. But on Friday Amalgamated Bank which has helped lead the effort received a letter reviewed by The New York Times confirming the decision.

“This approval is an important step towards improving coordination with law enforcement and preventing gun violence” said Senator Elizabeth Warren Democrat of Massachusetts one of the lawmakers who have been vocal on the issue. “In order for this new merchant code to be maximally effective every financial institution and payment system needs to step up and put it to use.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vdXMxMDMzLmNvbS9wb3B1bGFyLXJlc3RhdXJhbnQtaW4tYmlzbWFyY2stZGVjaWRlcy10by1jbG9zZS1mb3ItZ29vZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Popular Restaurant In Bismarck Decides To Close For Good,"In somewhat of a surprise move MacKenzie River Pizza Pub and Grill in north Bismarck has decided to close its doors for good. According to a message on their Facebook page MacKenzie Pizza Pub and Grill made this announcement on Wednesday September 7th.

The popular restaurant has been serving Bismarck Mandan for nearly 10 years. In the message to their fans MacKenzie River Pizza Grill and Pub said they could no longer maintain the level of service to their customers because of the limited labor available in the Bismarck Mandan area (limited labor or is it the fact that nobody wants to work anymore?).

They went on to thank their loyal customers over the years and especially the ones who stuck with them during the pandemic.

MacKenzie River originally left this message on their Facebook page stating they would be closing temporarily while they gather and train a new staff. The post on Facebook certainly looked as though the restaurant would open again. This was posted on August 18th.

I guess the challenges of trying to find new employees were just too much. I've asked this question before and I'll say it again. ""What are people doing for money these days?"" Is everybody making their money from YouTube and TikTok videos?

One thing for sure I would be extremely leery of opening up a new restaurant or any business for that matter where you need employees these days. It's quite clear that nobody wants to work for their money anymore. Kind of a sad state of affairs.

The 147000-square-foot center will be home to retailers such as Hobby Lobby TJ Maxx Ross Dress for Less Old Navy Five Below Ulta Beauty PetSmart Rack Room Shoes and others.

The development the largest retail investment in St. Clair County since 2005 was made possible by a partnership between Noon Real Estate the St. Clair County Commission the city of Pell City and the St. Clair County Economic Development Council.

The development sits on the site of the former St. Clair County Hospital at the corner of Interstate 20 and Highway 231. The property came under the ownership of the St. Clair County Commission and the city of Pell City in 2011 to enable the building of St. Vincent’s St. Clair.

“The city of Pell City is glad to see many years of efforts come to fruition in this project” said Mayor Bill Pruitt. “We have had some ups and downs with the retail market and COVID issues that were outside of our control. Pell City Square will fill a retail need in our community and will attract shoppers from surrounding areas to come and experience what Pell City has to offer.”

In concert with the groundbreaking ceremony on Thursday the city of Pell City announced the dedication of the U.S. 231 bridge crossing Interstate 20 as the William C. Ellison bridge. Ellison president and CEO of I-20 Development has orchestrated several commercial developments in Pell City including the Bankhead Marketplace and South Park Center shopping centers. More than 40% of the tax revenues generated in the city of Pell City are generated via the work of Ellison according to a release from the St. Clair County Economic Development Council."

The challenge: While most cruise passengers aren’t likely to be glued to their screens while at sea having reliable internet access is still important — passengers might need to check in with work or be reachable by the babysitter in places without cell service.

While internet access is available on all major cruise ships it’s usually delivered via satellites. This service can be slow and if the cruise ship doesn’t have a direct line of sight to a satellite the internet might not be available at all.

Starlink Maritime: SpaceX’s Starlink is a relative newcomer to the satellite internet industry but it’s already outperforming competitors and the addition of more satellites to its mega constellation in 2023 is expected to expand its coverage to the entire globe.

“[Starlink Maritime terminals are] ruggedized for relentless salt spray & extreme winds & storms in deep ocean.” Elon Musk

In June 2022 the FCC approved SpaceX’s request to provide its Starlink internet to moving vehicles such as trucks airplanes and ships. Within days the company announced Starlink Maritime a low-latency high-speed internet service for vessels at sea.

The service costs $5000 a month plus a one-time fee of $10000 for the installation of two “high performance” Starlink Maritime terminals that CEO Elon Musk tweeted are “ruggedized for relentless salt spray & extreme winds & storms in deep ocean.”

Currently the service is only available near coastlines — mostly of North American European and Australian nations — but SpaceX plans to expand its Starlink Maritime coverage into the mid-ocean later in 2022 and in early 2023.

Starlink Maritime’s coverage is expected to expand significantly in 2023. Credit: SpaceX

What’s new? Soon after the FCC ruling Royal Caribbean Group launched a trial of Starlink Maritime on its Freedom of the Seas cruise ship.

Based on the “tremendous amount of positive feedback from guests and crew” it is now adding the service to its entire fleet of 64 ships — installation of terminals has already begun and is expected to wrap before the second quarter of 2023.

“This technology will provide game-changing internet connectivity onboard our ships enhancing the cruise experience for guests and crew alike” said Jason Liberty Royal Caribbean Group’s president and CEO.

Why it matters: Royal Caribbean Group is one of the biggest cruise line operators in the world — in just the second quarter of 2022 its fleet carried 1.3 million passengers and those numbers are still slightly below pre-pandemic levels.

The availability of Starlink Maritime on its ships is going to change what a lot of cruise passengers expect of satellite internet at sea — potentially spurring other major cruise line operators to switch from their current providers to Starlink.

“We love the Rookery we love the distillery we love the food trucks where Deckhand Dave’s is” she said in an interview after singing a farewell song to local tourism and other business leaders invited abroad for a meet and greet Wednesday. “We’ve done a lot of hikes around here” including exploring most of the trails in the vicinity of the Mendenhall Glacier.

Cahoon’s “normal” summer as a cruise ship employee reflects a general return to business as usual highlighted by Jason Liberty CEO of Royal Caribbean Group which hosted the event aboard its 2490-passenger Serenade of the Seas. He has worked for the company since 2005 and became its new CEO in January presiding over a rebound after business literally dropped to zero at the height of the pandemic.

“There wasn’t any lesson in how to deal with that” he told attendees. “Fortunately Alaska had the insight to get the ball rolling…(and) our business is pretty much back to normal.”

But Alaska is lagging behind the recovery of many other destinations since “we are now operating in most places at 100% load factor.” In Alaska he said in an interview after his remarks the figure is about the same 70% other tourism officials say is occurring as the season nears its end.

Still that occupancy is up from the 40-50% reported at the beginning of the summer and as Liberty said in his remarks to the crowd “I’m sure all of you have felt the ramp-up here.” He’s also optimistic Alaska’s ridership will continue increasing next summer.

“It’s going to be very much like 2019” he said after addressing the audience.

The meet-and-greet comes as cruise line executives are doing their own get-togethers with local tour operators at their sites to evaluate offerings and possible contracts for next year. Cruise companies also just signed a memorandum of agreement with the city that features voluntary goals such as minimizing waste sent to the CBJ landfill boosting partnerships with locally owned businesses and supporting CBJ’s grant application for dock electrification funds.

The agreement is both specific to Juneau and somewhat unique said Preston Carnahan Royal Caribbean’s destination development director. While issues related to cruise tourism are common in various global ports he said mostly “we’re seeing dialogue” in addressing them.

SeaDream Yacht Club which operates Seadream I and Seadream II has recently made a 10 million USD investment to renovate its two vessels. The renovations include a complete refit of all the interior and exterior furnishings onboard bringing the yachts back into the realm of luxury cruising.

SpaceX Provides High-Speed Internet To Seadream

Elon Musk has hit a home run by bringing his SpaceX Starlink internet connectivity to the high seas. After Royal Caribbean Group announced a few weeks ago that it would be bringing the technology to its ships now boutique cruise line SeaDream Yacht Club has done the same.

The company which operates two small luxury cruise yachts Seadream I and Seadream II will offer guests Starlink’s high-speed internet connectivity while onboard.

As the vessels are small and carry only 112 passengers and 95 crew members guests can expect to experience Starlink’s complete package.

“I am proud to announce that SeaDream is at the forefront of technology becoming the first boutique travel line to implement Starlink on board. This innovation optimizes our guests’ experience by putting high-speed Internet at their fingertips—so they can stream their favorite entertainment work remotely and connect with friends and family back home” said Andreas Brynestad of SeaDream.

In fact due to the small size of the vessels Brynestad expects that the Seadream yachts will be able to offer guests the fastest internet available at sea which has already been tested for two months onboard:

“The small size of our yachts provides a distinct advantage in that we can deliver a larger amount of Internet per person on board—quite possibly making us the fastest Internet on the seas. In the two short months since introducing Starlink we have received remarkable positive feedback from guests and crew alike.”

The choice of Starlink as an internet provider onboard cruise ships is not surprising. The older satellite systems have always been a technology that lacked many things in particular speed. But these systems have also been incredibly expensive. Per month companies would expect to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars yearly; for larger companies even millions.

Starlink’s systems cost only 10000 dollars as a one-time installation fee and around 5000 dollars monthly as a subscription fee. Even now companies are increasing their WIFI access fees onboard cruise ships so the move to Starlink is undoubtedly understandable.

Seadream Yacht Club Brings Back Luxury

Built in 1984 and 1985 Seadream I and Seadream II are not the youngest ships in the industry. The company announced in January of this year it would be investing 10 million dollars to bring the ships back to the standards they are known for. Besides the move to include Starlink as an internet provider it included many more enhancements.

Since January both vessels have undergone a complete renovation of all staterooms starting from bare steel with the installation of all-new hardware and soft furnishings and streamlined storage areas. All staterooms now have USB/USBC charging ports Wi-Fi and sensor lighting.

There are new 55-inch LED TVs with a wide selection of movies TV channels and an infotainment system. The outer decks have been fitted with new teakwood decks and the vessel has new Balinese Dream Beds sun loungers and stargazers handcrafted from mahogany.

The SeaDream Yacht Club became the first boutique travel line to debut Starlink the company announced in a press release adding that this was part of its $10 million renovation investment. The family-owned and -operated business has two yachts SeaDream I and SeaDream II both of which have space for 56 couples and a 95-person crew.

SeaDream’s Andreas Brynestad shared that he was proud the company was at the forefront of technology and after having Starlink for two months has had a lot of positive feedback.

“I am proud to announce that SeaDream is at the forefront of technology becoming the first boutique travel line to implement Starlink on board.

Ever since SpaceX launched Starlink Maritime it’s proven to be an asset for yacht owners and cruiselines. I recently interviewed Paul Clarke of the Motor Yacht Loon the most Instagrammed superyacht in the world. Clarke told me that he thought Starlink is great and that he was very happy with it.

Royal Caribbean Group also announced that it will deploy Starlink on its International Celebrity Cruises and Silversea Cruise ships.

""What a s--- show of a job you have!"" comedian Josh Ocean Thomas said in response.

Thomas a San Diego native who moved to the Midwest to pursue comedy shared a clip of the exchange during his recent set at The Laugh Factory in Chicago on Instagram earlier this week where it has gone viral.

""You work for the Biden administration? Is your job to wake him up or what’s your job?"" Ocean asked ""Nick"" as the audience erupted into laughter.

BIDEN VOWS TO WITHHOLD WEAPONS FROM ISRAEL IF NETANYAHU GOES FORWARD WITH RAFAH INVASION

Miming a fictional Biden staffer trying to get the president’s attention he exclaimed ""Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! There’s a war! Hey!""

The bit continued with Thomas asking Nick what he really does for Biden. Before he could respond the comic remarked ""What a s--- show of a job you have. I can’t believe you admitted that in front of all these people.""

""You have the freedom to lie. You could have said you were a hooker and I would’ve been prouder of you"" he added.

The alleged Biden staffer started to tell Thomas that he travels to southern states before the comic interrupted with a burst of laughter.

""That’s crazy! You go to the south and try to sell ‘em on Biden? You’re f----- r------! What the f---? What are you talking about?"" he said. ""That’s your f----- job? Is to go ‘Hey listen I know you guys like Trump but Biden. I mean…’""

The clip ended with one last joke as Thomas asked ""Wow. Are you ready to be unemployed? Or what’s your vibe?""

Thomas captioned the video writing ""This was my only option.""

Thomas wasn't the only comic to take aim at Biden this week.

Anti-Trump comedian Michael Rapaport torched the president in a video he shared to X on Thursday in which he officially declared he would not be supporting Biden’s re-election after the world leader told CNN he would not send weapons to Israel if it invades Rafah Hamas' last stronghold in Gaza.

Laturnus Obituary 2024,"Peter S. (Pete) Laturnus

December 30 1934 – May 09 2024

Peter S. Laturnus 89 of Munich ND passed away on May 09 2024 at CHI St Alexius Health Devils Lake Hospital.

Mass of Christian Burial for Pete will be held on Tuesday May 14 2024 at 10:30 a.m. at St Mary’s Catholic Church in Munich ND with Father Brian Moen celebrating the Mass. Burial will be at the St Boniface Catholic Cemetery. Visitation will be at the church one hour prior to the funeral Mass.

Visitation will be at the Gilbertson Funeral Home Devils Lake on Monday May 13th from 4:00 p.m. until 7:00 p.m. with a Rosary and Prayer Service at 6:00 p.m.

Peter Sebastian was born on December 30 1934 in Wilkin Saskatchewan Canada one of 13 children of Sylvester and Gunda (Steffan) Laturnus. He was the third youngest of the family. In 1945 the family moved to a farm near Starkweather North Dakota and later to Cando North Dakota where Pete attended Metcalf County school through the 8th grade. Several years later the family moved to a farm near Clyde North Dakota. Pete obtained his U.S. citizenship in 1960.

Pete worked with his brother-in-law Elmer Mueller for many years doing plumbing and heating work. When Elmer retired Pete started his own plumbing and heating business along with farming for many years at Calio N.D. He so loved the farm and could build and fix almost anything. He also enjoyed making his rounds on the farm in his golf cart. He built a go kart for his children and it has gone through all the grandchildren and now great grandchildren. It has been one of the many highlights of the kids going to the farm. Pete enjoyed his annual fishing trips with family and his many buddies over the years as well as spending time with family at the cabin at Red Willow.

Pete and Donna met at a dance in Calio and on November 19th 1956 were married at St. Boniface Catholic Church in Calio. They attended church in Calio and later St. Mary’s Catholic Church in Munich. Throughout their married years they were on the dance floor often dancing to their treasured waltzes and polkas.

Growing up like many teenagers UN Goodwill Ambassador and entrepreneur Sabrina Elba suffered from acne and post-inflammatory skin hyperpigmentation. With a condition that causes dark spots where active red acne pimples once were she tried acids and many products from Sephora to clear her face of breakouts only for it to do more harm than good.

“I started to really feel the effects of that as I was growing up because the skin barrier damage it was getting worse” says Elba the founder of new skin care brand S’Able Labs. “It wasn’t getting better.”

Her mother however relied on the traditions of their Somali heritage to curate a natural skincare routine that always kept her skin breakout-free.

“I grew up watching [my mom] make [her] own products and face masks and DIY everything in the kitchen” she says. “I think that was probably I mean for sure the influence that led me to adding these African botanicals into the [S’Able Labs] skincare range.”

The potency of those natural ingredients passed down from generation to generation inspired the model to start her own African skincare line with husband and fellow African Idris Elba.

“The fact that we come from East Africa and [Idris] is from West Africa and this sort of continental theme African theme this Pan-African theme … what I realized and sort of become addicted to is these stories and heritage pieces around these ingredients and these customs” says Sabrina Elba.

Their African skincare or A-Beauty line is formulated with antioxidants — including turmeric okra quasil and black seed — to target skincare concerns on a cellular level like hyperpigmentation a common condition that people with melanin experience.

Among S’Able Labs’ newest products is their Okra Face Serum which is made with a trademarked bio-available retinol called SymRenew; African Resurrection Plant an antioxidant; the brand’s own Hyperprevent technology to lessen hyperpigmentation; and botanical peptides derived from okra which the company calls “nature’s Botox.”

“This has integrity behind it and an efficacy there” Sabrina Elba says. “And I want to show people that African ingredients are so powerful.”

Macroeconomic headwinds unfavorable currency movements and overall market pessimism have weighed on the stock’s shares so far. However the company is leaving no stone unturned to boost its business growth by widening its portfolio and growing inorganically. According to the TipRanks tool bullish financial bloggers and retail investors also paint a positive outlook on the stock.

Salesforce Looks Unstoppable

Salesforce is a formidable name as a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) player in the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) enterprise application market. The California-based company boasts a solid record of an earnings beat. Salesforce has successfully delivered an earnings surprise in all the trailing quarters in the last couple of years. If the trend persists it can provide strong support to its share price performance in the coming quarters.

The cloud-based software company has been riding solid demand levels as customers remain inclined toward digital transformation. Backed by these factors Salesforce’s Fiscal Q2-2023 earnings results were impressive. Both revenue and earnings per share (EPS) beat analysts’ estimates.

Another factor that boosts Salesforce’s capacity to weather tough market conditions is its mammoth balance sheet. The company flaunted cash and cash equivalents of over $13.5 billion as of July end. This cash-rich company can undertake projects to accelerate its organic and inorganic growth and undertake capital deployment initiatives. It doesn’t come as a surprise that Salesforce announced a new share repurchase program worth $10 billion with the recently reported quarterly results.

However the company slashed its Fiscal 2023 earnings and revenue guidance largely due to macroeconomic uncertainties and unfavorable currency movements. This highlights a little bumpy road ahead. For Fiscal 2023 adjusted EPS is projected in the range of $4.71-$4.73 and revenue is expected to come between $30.9 billion and $31 billion implying a 20% growth.

What Is the Target Price for Salesforce Stock?

CRM stock’s average price target of $225.19 implies a 43.5% upside potential from the current levels. Moreover CRM stock looks like a great investment option to park your money. Wall Street is optimistic about the prospects of CRM stock and has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 29 Buys and four Holds.

Further financial bloggers are 85% bullish on CRM stock compared to the sector average of 65%. As per TipRanks retail investors too look bullish on the stock as they increased their holdings in CRM stock by 2.5% in the last 30 days.

Conclusion: CRM Has Bright Prospects

Salesforce stock seems to have the potential to turn around the 38.6% decline in its shares so far in 2022. In expanding its offerings the company recently introduced the next generation of MuleSoft Customer 360 innovations and Tableau Cloud. Inorganically Salesforce is gaining on the growing popularity of Slack among its customer base as the company expects a $1.5 billion top-line contribution from Slack in Fiscal 2023.

A software-as-a-service (SaaS) data platform typically provides one or more capabilities such as data integration data cleansing data transformation data storage model integration analytics dashboarding visualization or machine learning.

A SaaS data platform may run in the account of an independent software vendor (ISV) or a dedicated account provided by the customer. In both of these cases it’s essential for the SaaS platform to integrate with AWS services running in the customer’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) account.

There are a number of benefits to this such as:

Provides customers with a seamless analytics experience.

Enables customers to use services they are familiar with.

Gives customers choice of tools to use.

Allows SaaS vendors to focus on what matters and rapidly take advantage of trusted AI/ML services.

Prevents data from being locked in the SaaS data platform.

Depending on service avoids data duplication by enabling in-place querying.

Helps build joint solutions and GTM strategies with AWS.

Integration Architecture

AWS has more than 200 services and when it comes to SaaS data platforms from ISV partners there is a category of services where we see the most adoption in terms of integration. The diagram below shows these services grouped according to their functionality along with the core components a SaaS data platform may have.

Such a platform may provide a subset or all of these functionalities and may ingest data from both on-premises and cloud source systems. The focus of this post is on services that complement the functionality of the data platform rather than on connectors to source systems.

Figure 1 – Integration architecture.

Starting from the AI/ML services Amazon SageMaker is a powerful platform for end-to-end machine learning (ML) lifecycle providing a fully managed infrastructure. Meanwhile AWS AI services are pre-trained models for common use cases based on the same deep learning technology that powers Amazon.com. Integration with these services adds ML functionality to a SaaS platform with little effort and gives data scientists a unified experience regardless of whether the data is in the SaaS platform or in another system.

Amazon Athena Amazon AppFlow and AWS Glue integration enable data that’s in the SaaS platform to be explored catalogued and exported for further analytics with AWS services such as Amazon Redshift for data warehousing and Amazon QuickSight for dashboarding and visualization.

Integration with AWS Internet of Things (IoT) services allow building joint solutions between AWS and the ISV that join IoT data with enterprise resource planning (ERP) customer relationship management (CRM) and other data to tackle pressing business problems as described in this AWS blog post. This can range from predictive maintenance and reducing carbon footprint to improving supply chain resiliency.

Services and Integration Method

In this section I’ll provide an overview of how the integration with these services can be built with links to successful integration stories from AWS ISV Partners.

Amazon SageMaker

Amazon SageMaker is a broad platform where there can be multiple points of integration.

The first stage in ML model development is data preparation. Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler simplifies this process by providing data scientists with a visual interface to select clean and explore their datasets. The integration from data flow directly to the SaaS platform allows data to be imported for further processing as shown in the image below. There are a few ways in which this integration can work including via a JDBC connection.

Figure 2 – Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler Integration.

When it comes to inference there are multiple options. The inference can be real-time serverless asynchronous or batch transform. When invoking a model deployed to an endpoint best practice is to seal the backend with an Amazon API Gateway that calls the endpoint via an AWS Lambda function that runs in a protected private network.

Amazon SageMaker Autopilot helps automatically build train and tune the best ML model. This is especially powerful to integrate into platforms where building models may be an auxiliary functionality such as in the case of Snowflake integration where models can be trained and invoked using simple SQL functions. In the case of Domo the integration is via the console user interface (UI). In cases where due to governance constraints SageMaker Autopilot needs to run in a different AWS account then cross-account access needs to be set up.

Other possible integration points are Amazon SageMaker Feature Store to create a single source of features that can be used by multiple teams; Amazon SageMaker Model Registry to create a single source of models and manage versioning; and Amazon Ground Truth which is a data labelling service.

AWS AI Services

AWS pre-trained AI services are particularly useful to integrate where standard functionality such as language translation image recognition or sentiment analysis is required. In such cases rather than building custom ML models services such as Amazon Translate Amazon Rekognition and Amazon Comprehend can be invoked by simple API calls.

For instance to extract health data from unstructured medical text developers can call Amazon Comprehend Medical from a Snowflake stored procedure via a Lambda function and get the results back in JSON.

These services also allow new products to be built as in the case of Anaplan integrating with Amazon Forecast. In addition these services can be combined to address a specific use case such as the example where Amazon Textract and Amazon Comprehend are used to provide Intelligent Document Processing (IDP).

Amazon Athena

Amazon Athena is an interactive query service based on Presto. The Athena Federated Query feature allows data in on-premises and cloud source systems to be queried via a simple SQL statement on Athena’s serverless architecture. This is very powerful in that the query can be executed from the AWS Management Console an Amazon SageMaker Notebook or via Amazon QuickSight. It can also be used to extract data into a customer’s Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket so the data can be used with a wide range of other AWS services.

SaaS vendors can build their own connectors using the Athena Query Federation SDK. This takes the form of two Lambda functions that act as a connector between the Athena engine and SaaS data platform and allow users to access data that is in the SaaS platform as described in this example.

Figure 3 – Amazon Athena Custom Connector data source via Lambda function.

Amazon AppFlow

Athena Federated Query works best for interactive querying and transferring small amounts of data. On the other hand Amazon AppFlow is a fully managed service for enterprise-scale secure data transfer with no code required. It enables bidirectional integration between SaaS platforms and AWS services such as Amazon S3 and Amazon Redshift.

Salesforce SAP OData and Infor Nexus are some of the sources supported. There is also support for Salesforce Private Connect which leverages AWS PrivateLink to transfer data securely between AWS and Salesforce over the AWS private network. Snowflake and Upsolver are examples of SaaS data platforms supported.

The connector for a SaaS platform may be developed by AWS or by the ISV partner. The open-source Custom Connector SDK enables the development of a private shared or public connector using Python or Java by ISV Partners. The connector is a Lambda function that acts an intermediary between Amazon AppFlow and the SaaS platform.

Figure 4 – Amazon AppFlow integration.

AWS Glue

AWS Glue is a serverless data integration service for preparing data for analytics and machine learning. SaaS vendors can build a custom connector based on Athena Federated Query JDBC or Apache Spark DataSource. These connectors can also be listed on AWS Marketplace. Snowflake Splunk and Cassandra are some of the platforms for which a connector can be purchased. An alternative method for Snowflake is to use a custom connector based on JDBC. For MongoDB Atlas there’s native support in AWS Glue.

Another point of integration is with AWS Glue Data Catalog. You can use AWS Glue Data Catalog as the central data catalog for the organization where tables (which are metadata definitions that represent the data) from all data stores are listed. In addition ISVs can configure AWS Glue Data Catalog to be used as a metastore in place of their Hive metastore as in the case of Starburst.

It’s also possible to extract information from AWS Glue Data Catalog to store in an external catalog such as Collibra where a JDBC driver which leverages the Amazon Athena JDBC driver under the hoods is utilized.

Figure 5 – AWS Glue Custom Connector.

Amazon QuickSight

Amazon QuickSight can connect to SaaS data sources such as Salesforce Snowflake Teradata and Adobe Analytics out of the box. For other SaaS data platforms the easiest method currently is via an Athena Federated Query.

The second level of integration is embedding QuickSight dashboards which is possible with the QuickSight Enterprise edition. The integration can be via an embed code that can be pasted into the application or via the QuickSight API where authentication is done through an IAM role. Salesforce utilizes the latter method.

One advantage of this approach is that data from both Salesforce and the customer’s AWS account can be displayed in a single dashboard without the need to replicate data taking advantage of QuickSight’s serverless architecture.

Amazon Redshift

Amazon Redshift can be both a source and destination depending on the SaaS data platform. In the case of Databricks data can be loaded into Apache Spark SQL DataFrames from Amazon S3 and then gold tables can be queried in place or loaded into Redshift using the Redshift Spectrum to Delta Lake integration. Domo’s Redshift connector retrieves data based on a SQL query.

A number of other partners such as Upsolver Matillion and Informatica integrate directly via the Amazon Redshift console. Upsolver low-code data pipelines can be used to stream event data into Redshift via Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and can also be used to write the stream to a data lake to be queried with Amazon Redshift Serverless. Matillion can be used to rapidly build data pipelines to ingest data into Amazon Redshift.

Figure 6 – Amazon Redshift partner integration.

AWS IoT Services

For a data platform AWS IoT services are typically a source where having a native connector would accelerate the data ingestion process.

There are multiple ways in which this can be accomplished. Streaming data in real time via Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is the fastest method. This is a managed service so there’s no need to write an application or manage resources—the data is delivered directly to the destination.

The data can also be batched compressed transformed and encrypted before being loaded into destination system. Integration with a number of SaaS providers has already been built such as MongoDB Atlas Splunk and Datadog. In the case of MongoDB Atlas it leverages an incoming webhook.

Figure 7 – Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose integration.

A second option is to build a connector to stream data directly from Kinesis Data Streams. Databricks and MuleSoft are two SaaS platforms that have out-of-the-box connectors to Kinesis.

A third option is to get IoT data via AWS IoT Core. Data from AWS IoT Core can be sent to various destinations such as AWS Lambda Amazon Kinesis Data Stream Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) or HTTPS endpoint. In the case of Salesforce a custom connector allows messages from devices to be routed directly to Salesforce IoT Cloud via an AWS IoT Rule with a Salesforce action type. An added benefit of integration with IoT Core is that the communication with devices can be bi-directional.

The fourth method is via AWS IoT SiteWise which is an asset modelling and time series database. The asset model can be extracted using the API and the asset data can be published to the AWS IoT Core MQTT message broker.

Data can also be streamed through Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK) and ISVs can create a custom plugin which is a set of JAR files containing the connector logic.

Other Services

The services covered in this post are the main AWS services which can be integrated with SaaS data platforms but it’s not an exhaustive list. There are many other AWS services that can add value to SaaS data platforms.

For instance Domo’s integration with AWS Data Exchange provides a solution to discover subscribe to and access third-party data in the cloud without leaving the platform. With AWS IoT Greengrass AWS ISV Partners can build and deploy a version of their product to devices to process data or run machine learning models for predictions.

Conclusion

In this post I covered the main AWS services SaaS data platforms can integrate with to provide customers with a seamless experience and take advantage of AWS services in order to accelerate their drive to meeting their business goals.

I also gave an overview of how those integrations can be built and examples of AWS ISV Partners who have successfully developed these. If you are interested in building such integrations require further information or would like help to construct a roadmap for these integrations please get in touch with your AWS account team.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVudGVycHJpc2V0aW1lcy5jby51ay8yMDIyLzA5LzA5L2RvY3VzaWduLWNsbS1hZGRzLWZyZWUtc2xhY2staW50ZWdyYXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DocuSign CLM adds free Slack integration -,"Customers using both DocuSign CLM and Slack will be pleased to read that they have released an integration between the two solutions. The integration is available on the Slack App Directory. While DocuSign told Enterprise Times that the solution is free paid plans are available but no information is available in the Directory.

This latest integration between the two company’s solutions adds to the one that already exists for DocuSign eSignature for Slack. This latest solution connects the contract processing tasks with Slack. It enables organisations to leverage Slack for approval processes so that people can continue working in Slack without switching applications.

Jerome Levadoux Chief Product Officer at DocuSign commented: “Through our unique partnership with Salesforce and Slack we’re ensuring businesses can utilize robust features and capabilities to further their digital transformation.

“With our latest release of DocuSign CLM for Slack businesses and users can now move agreements forward and conduct business more quickly and efficiently in today’s Anywhere Economy.”

DocuSign CLM for Slack

The new solution brings together two leaders in their sectors. It will enable users to work within their application of choice. As contracts are initiated and tasks assigned these assignments can now be passed directly to stakeholders within Slack. This notification allows them to review agreements including revisions complete tasks approve edits or make changes from within Slack.

Users can also generate and send documents from Slack initiating the contract process. They can also add additional comments reply to existing comments or resolve comments on clauses within Slack.

Finally when the documents are ready for signing the platform seamlessly integrates with the DocuSign eSignature platform.

Steve Wood SVP of Product Platform at Slack commented: “This new integration further strengthens our partnership DocuSign and will provide users with the tools they need to get work done more efficiently. By integrating DocuSign’s CLM with Slack users can now easily take meaningful actions on every phase of an agreement process right from their digital HQ allowing businesses to do more with what they already have.”

Enterprise Times: What does this mean

The fact that this solution is free will please customers of the solutions. It also means that those already using Slack will note that when looking for a CLM solution DocuSign will have an advantage over some other solutions. DocuSign appears to be the only CLM platform available on the Slack Marketplace.

How will DocuSign develop this integration and how many customers will take advantage of it? The Slack Marketplace does not have a reviews section. Interestingly while this is a joint announcement by both companies Slack only carries out what it says is “a brief review of apps in our App Directory and does not endorse or certify these apps.” It will be interesting to see what changes happen under the ownership of Salesforce. Salesforce has a more rigorous acceptance process before apps are listed on the Salesforce AppExchange.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vdGVjaC9pbmZvcm1hdGlvbi10ZWNoL2NhcGdlbWluaS1hbm5vdW5jZXMtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24tb2Ytc2luZ2Fwb3JlLWJhc2VkLWFvZGlneS9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NDEwMTkxNS5jbXPSAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL3RlY2gvaW5mb3JtYXRpb24tdGVjaC9jYXBnZW1pbmktYW5ub3VuY2VzLWFjcXVpc2l0aW9uLW9mLXNpbmdhcG9yZS1iYXNlZC1hb2RpZ3kvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk0MTAxOTE1LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Capgemini announces acquisition of Singapore-based Aodigy,"It seems like you're already an ETPrime member with

""We had the chance to work with a group of engineers in the additive manufacturing department and learn a lot.”

Faisal Ashour a chemical engineering student recalled that during his six-week internship at NOC he learned about the oil and gas industry and Al Shaheen field which produces approximately 45% of Qatar’s oil production.

""I interned as a process engineer on the upstream processes of NOC’s offshore platforms. The tasks I was assigned to created and developed crucial process engineering skills that have advanced my growth as a chemical engineer.""

Schlumberger welcomed 12 students — the largest cohort of Tamuq interns placed in an organisation this internship season. Farah Shabbir an electrical engineering student said that interning at Schlumberger gave an insight into how the industry works.

According to Daniel Vemagiri Marbaniang talent acquisition manager - Qatar Schlumberger the students from Tamuq were equipped to work efficiently and contribute right from the first day.

Apart from putting their engineering knowledge into practice students explored challenging work practices taking ownership and responsibility of tasks enhancing interpersonal skills and working independently as part of a team. They received specific job-related training and were exposed to diverse environments and work cultures.

Dr Hassan S Bazzi senior associate dean for research and advancement at Tamuq said: “We are committed towards developing engineering leaders who can have a direct positive impact on the country. These internships give us the opportunity to showcase the high quality of students enrolled at Tamuq thus giving potential employers a glimpse of what to expect.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxqZXdlbGVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy8xMTI0OS1iZXlvbmNlLW9uY2UtYWdhaW4tZnJvbnRzLXRpZmZhbnktY28tY2FtcGFpZ27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Beyoncé Once Again Fronts Tiffany & Co.

Many customers leverage managed solutions providers to manage their AWS accounts and they’re looking for AWS native solutions and integrations to solve their business problems.

Lifecycle management includes discovering new resources from customer’s AWS environment populating them via federation into ServiceNow’s Configuration Management Database (CMDB) “on-boarding” those resources via tasks and running managed services operations on them.

Kyndryl designs builds manages and modernizes the mission-critical technology systems that the world depends on every day. As a certified AWS Managed Services Provider (MSP) and AWS Premier Consulting Partner with four partner programs and 50+ AWS customer launches Kyndryl has the ability to create solutions for challenges that fit the unique and evolving needs of customers.

The current process of AWS resource onboarding at Kyndryl involves multiple teams (e.g. tools build compliance and delivery teams) and tools (e.g. Ansible Netcool Datadog and ServiceNow). Prior to this automation the process involved a sequence of manual tasks shown in the following and it could take anywhere from days to weeks:

Resource Discovery and CI creation using inhouse solution

Installing agents and configuring

Register devices to Ansible/Netcool

Running Healthcheck Security and Compliance tasks

How Kyndryl made it work – Solution overview

Kyndryl designed an Automation approach that involved AWS Service Management Connector AWS Config AWS Systems Manager and ServiceNow for easier onboarding of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) endpoint instances. The solution included the following steps:

Near real-time discovery of Amazon EC2 instances from AWS Config using AWS Service Management Connector for resources that are tagged as “Kyndryl Managed”. Use ServiceNow as an orchestration engine for automation. Triggering the onboarding of discovered Amazon EC2 instances using ServiceNow CMDB and Service Portal. Systems Manager automation execution through Change Request / Tasks. Track progress create a central repository of onboarding evidences and send notifications for the success/failures of onboarding tasks to stakeholders.

Detailed architecture diagram

Discovery of Amazon EC2 instances using AWS Service Management Connector into ServiceNow’s CMDB

Kyndryl leverages AWS Service Management Connector integration with AWS Config to have near real-time visibility of AWS Resources. The scheduled job runs every 31 mins to synchronize data into ServiceNow CMDB. Kyndryl is a domain separated environment in ServiceNow and further customizes AWS Service Management Connector to do the following steps that are critical for a multi-tenant environment of managed service provider:

Tag based filtering which discovers only resources that are tagged as Kyndryl managed.

On Before business rule was created in CMDB base class to route the AWS Config resource to the domain the company and the AWS account it belongs to.

On After business rule was created to build relationship between OS Image class and virtual machine (VM) instance (Windows Linux) class in ServiceNow.

ServiceNow as orchestration engine:

Kyndryl has a domain-separated environment in ServiceNow in which they can host multiple enterprise customers. Kyndryl has built its own QuickStart framework that provides a customized catalog items to request the onboarding of Windows and Linux virtual servers. These catalog items are available through the ServiceNow service portal where users can request the process. The catalog item functions in a way where based on the requester the company field populates and from the company it lists all of the associated AWS accounts. Once the AWS account is selected the portal queries the ServiceNow CMDB and lists all of the available virtual Windows and Linux machines.

Onboarding process of Amazon EC2 Instances:

The resources with tag value “kyndryl_managed = Yes” and “kyndryl_onboarding = not_initiated” are available for the request management workflow. The sample portal page is shown in the following where a requester can submit an order by selecting one of the available VM’s for onboarding.

It is possible to select and submit up to 10 VMs for onboarding through a single request. Once the request is submitted ServiceNow will trigger individual request for each VM and subsequently automate execution of tasks.

The request process requested item (RITM) will create a change request for onboarding of AWS Linux VM as shown in the following.

Automation execution through change tasks

A series of change tasks are now executed through the change request. The associated change tasks will run automation execution tasks that include:

Ansible automation tasks that invoke API calls to Ansible tower to execute playbooks on the AWS environment. AWS Automation that leverages direct API calls from ServiceNow to execute Systems Manager documents on AWS resources. The documents include installing prerequisites creating local service-id Datadog agent configuration etc CI Wizard automation within the ServiceNow platform to make updates to ServiceNow CMDB

Upon the successful completion of change tasks the change request is set to complete and the request is complete which successfully onboards the VM instance and allows Kyndryl to manage AWS resources. At any point in the workflow if any automation execution failure happens then the change request flow is set to pending and an incident is created for a failed task. Once the incident is resolved the execution and further pending tasks will be set to completion.

Summary:

Kyndryl now offers a solution for the lifecycle management of your AWS resources such as Amazon EC2 instances with end-to-end automation leveraging AWS Service Management Connector AWS Config and Systems Manager documents.

Not only are the seasons transitioning but so are our homes as we switch up our designs in preparation for the cooler months. It's an exciting time for designers and color directors too with new color trends emerging as we get ever closer to 2023.

The colors we use in our homes are always a reflection of the times we're living through. They have the power to set a mood in our homes and while our personal preferences will always ensure there's variety among our personal styles we can't help but lean towards tones that speak to now. Post-pandemic it was all about embracing color and vitality through design. More recently we've seen earthy warmer hues take center stage. Now everyone is eager to know what next big interior design trend is in store for the year ahead.

One paint brand with a color forecast we can't get enough of is the Sherwin-Williams Colormix forecast. Named Terra the collection is composed of 40 colors across four different palettes and is inspired by the connection we share with the natural world and the beauty of the landscapes that surround us. We caught up with their director of color marketing Sue Wadden to learn more about each palette.

Sue Wadden Director of color marketing at Sherwin-Williams Sue Wadden oversees all things color for leading paint brand Sherwin-Williams. As such she dedicates her time to the development of color systems and researching color and industry trends making her responsible for the brand's annual Colormix forecast as seen below.

Biome

The first collection in Sherwin-William's Terra palette is called Biome with the tagline 'our world our home'. Comprised of earthy neutrals and smoky grey-toned blues greens and yellows the calming scheme evokes images of a dense forest floor.

'The Biome palette is all about preserving peace and balance and is a great representation of how interior trends are inviting nature into our homes' explains Sue. 'What I love about forecasting is capturing the continuum of color trends and our 2020 and 2021 Colors of the Year – Urbane Bronze SW 7048 and Evergreen Fog SW 9130 – are both included in this palette.'

According to Sue the decision to include these colors is due to their enduring relevance. 'Our 2023 forecast builds on the direction that design’s been moving in providing continuity as trends continue to evolve.' With this in mind the Biome palette embraces a darker version of these natural colors 'bringing added moodiness to themes like regeneration and sustainability.'

Some of the best rooms for earth tones are those associated with relaxation - such as the living room or bedroom - thanks to their calming restorative qualities. 'They also pair beautifully with warmer wood tones and other nature-inspired materials like stone and natural tile' says Sue who recommends using them in a mudroom or entryway to make use of that balance.

Lore

(Image credit: Sherwin-Williams)

Inspired by the history of craft and creativity the Lore palette is a color trend all about reconnecting with traditional tones of ancient reds and understated neutrals. Like the Biome scheme Lore's jewel-toned purples oranges and greens symbolize the connection to the earth but in a slightly bolder way.

'These colors work especially well in communal home spaces like family rooms or dining rooms as well as any space you want to feel energized in like a home office' says Sue. 'A deep hue like Carnelian SW 7580 envelopes you and is perfect for adding drama to a cozy dining nook while a brighter jewel tone like Blue Peacock SW 0064 brings a touch of sophistication to a kitchen or family room.'

Throughout all elements of design the past year has seen a move toward curating more convivial spaces that are playful and expressive. The hues in the Lore palette speak exactly to that offering bright pops of color that are perfect for injecting an element of fun into your home.

As Sue explains: 'We expect to see the unexpected use of color continue to trend in 2023 making the colors in this collection a fun and nostalgic way to transform a room.'

Nexus

(Image credit: Sherwin-Williams)

In stark contrast to the Lore palette is Nexus a palette of natural clays soft pinks and sunbaked desert sands. Ranging from 'Cool Beige' to 'Reddened Earth' the neutral color scheme represents serenity and although similar they all have an individual sense to them.

'Monochromatic palettes are trending as people seek out calming and serene color schemes for their homes' explains Sue. 'The Nexus palette showcases the warmth and depth of neutrals with earthy desert beiges and pink tones while providing inspiration for bringing trending brown tones into a space.'

According to Sue the collection of ten hues is extremely versatile and works well in any space especially when layered together. 'For example you could paint a wall in Redend Point SW 9081 and use a tonal neutral like Kestrel White SW 7516 on the trim to add more dimension to a space.'

These paints needn't be limited to your walls either. 'A saturated hue like Lei Flower SW 6613 is perfect for furniture and could easily brighten up a room if applied to something like a vanity or dresser' says Sue. 'You can balance this tonal palette with warm creams and lots of texture through linens and room accents for a restorative feel.'

Origin

(Image credit: Sherwin-Williams)

The final palette Origin is the brightest of all four of Sherwin-Williams' Colormix palettes. These classic shades ranging from a charcoal black to a rich purple called 'Fabulous Grape' are free-spirited and enduring colors that feel optimistic.

'Origin is all about creative expression' says Sue. 'The bright playful colors in this palette are perfect for reenergizing a space whether that means painting a kitchen island bright orange or your ceiling a deep green.'

This scheme encourages daring designs. Unusual color combinations of clashing colors such as the deep purple of 'Fabulous Grape' and the bright orange-yellow of 'Goldfinch' are a great way to embrace experimentation in our homes through color. 'For unexpectedly bright color pairings try using them in adjacent spaces' Sue says. 'You could paint one room a certain hue and use the other color in an adjacent one to add visual interest and movement.'

While bright and bold these colors won't look garish in your home when used properly. The trick is to use small pops of color strategically. 'Accent walls or small spaces are ideal to incorporate these “rainbow” colors without overwhelming a room' Sue explains. 'For example Kale Green SW 6460 is a mid tone green that would pop on an office wall or on lower kitchen cabinets while still looking sophisticated.'",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJoZy5jb20vZGVjb3JhdGluZy9jb2xvci9zY2hlbWVzL2ludGVyaW9yLWNvbG9yLXNjaGVtZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Interior Color Schemes,"Interior Color Scheme: Modern Mediterranean

Peach is a color that sometimes gets a negative reaction. But San Francisco designer Patrice Cowan Bevans sees a different side of it—one that's fresh flexible and worthy of launching a palette. ""There's a lot of energy behind this peach"" Bevans says. ""It's a warm red-based shade that¿s more terra-cotta than pale."" Espresso is the game-changer adding a dark accent that along with aqua gives the palette a modern edge.

The Colors: (from top to bottom) Natural Wicker OC-1; benjaminmoore.com This warm neutral works well for large pieces. Jamaican Aqua 2048-60; benjaminmoore.com This vibrant aqua dds the pop. Match small upholstered pieces and pillows to this hue. Raisin 1237; benjaminmoore.com Try this reddish brown on trim using a semigloss finish. Porter Ranch Cream 148; benjaminmoore.com With a hint of peach this cream takes the starkness out of white ceilings. Intense Peach 081; benjaminmoore.com A warm shade that's like a comforting blanket on walls. If you're color-shy limit it to a feature wall.

Patrice Bevans' Color Scheme Tips

1. Think of places or things that spark a positive emotion. ""If you go with what inspires you you'll enjoy the palette without hesitation"" Bevans says. Something tangible is easiest—Bevans' patterned pencil bag inspired her colors.

2. Extrapolate don't duplicate. ""Pinpoint what color in the inspiration piece grabs you first then build from there"" Bevans says. ""Don't worry about exact matches. Play around."" For example a burgundy color in an inspiration piece could translate into dark brown.

3. Don't get hung up on paint names; they can sway you to choose a wrong color or scare you away from a good one. ""They're just labels"" Bevans says. ""I never initially tell clients the paint name because they get wrapped up in the mental image the name conveys.""

4. ""A piece of fabric or a throw pillow can lay the groundwork for a palette. Think of it as a compass for pulling together a color scheme"" Bevans says.

Interior Color Scheme: Spring Renewal

When friends ask Little Rock designer Cortney Singleton for inspiration for a can't-go-wrong color scheme she often tells them to look out their windows. ""Nature doesn't make mistakes"" Singleton says. An overcast sky inspired this palette of washed-out gray-blues and golden neutrals. A vibrant green gleaned from budding foliage adds energy. ""It's that touch of new life associated with spring—a surprise pop in an otherwise subdued and classic color scheme"" Singleton says.

The Colors: (from top to bottom) Ivoire SW6127; sherwin-williams.com This golden-tone neutral doesn't wimp out. Use it both on walls and for draperies to create a soothing seamless background. Underseas SW6214; sherwinwilliams.com A moody blue adds intrigue. Try it as a feature wall or match to furniture. Hazel SW6471; sherwin-williams.com A change-up to the usual white ceiling or as a secondary accent color this soft blue delivers a subtle punch. Antiquity SW6402; sherwin-williams.com Use this olive-y green in tiny dabs. Macadamia SW6142; sherwin-williams.com This midrange neutral is a solid choice for upholstered pieces.

Cortney Singleton's Interior Color Scheme Tips

1. Choose the one most important color that will set the mood you want. ""I wanted the look and feel of a stormy afternoon so the first thing I did was find a moody blue"" Singleton says.

2. Pair with a neutral—every palette no matter how bold needs one. If the starting-point color is heavy or muted the neutral should be too. ""They need to balance one another"" she says.

3. Find a fabric that has all the colors you like. ""You need one anchor piece that everything is tied to"" Singleton says. ""A patterned fabric is so easy—it hands you a palette.""

Interior Color Scheme: Seaside Neutrals

""Beachy"" and ""spa"" are words Washington D.C. designer Liz Levin hears time and again from clients wanting to redo their rooms. So she married the two into one relaxing palette. A pale blue her starting point offers spa-inspired lightness and crispness yet still has the watery hue associated with the beach. Driftwood which can look gray silver or brown warms the cool blue and white. The airy palette is a twist on the heavier brown-and-blue schemes popular recently. ""This is the room equivalent of a breath of fresh air"" Levin says.

The Colors: (from top to bottom) Frappe 6003-1B; valspar.com A medium-tone neutral is good for pieces that need staying power. Ice Rink Blue 4007-5A; valspar.com This grayed blue is a sophisticated backdrop that won't scream for attention. Safari Beige 6006-2B; valspar.com Chocolate brown adds heft to an airy palette.

Please note that the actual colors may appear different than what is displayed on screen.

Liz Levin's Interior Color Scheme Tips

1. Determine your style. ""Do you want the room to be modern or traditional calming or energizing?"" Liz asks. The answers will steer you toward inspiration pieces—a graphic rug for example—that can set the tone for how colors will mingle.

2. Categorize colors as light medium or dark. ""Your palette should have some in each category"" Levin says. ""A fail-safe option is to keep large items such as a sofa in the medium range and then punch things up with light and dark accents.""

3. Choose paint colors last. ""Paint should tie everything together not be the thing that defines the room"" Levin says. ""I usually like walls to be the softest element so they don't scream at you—plus that's the safest way to not make a mistake.""

4. ""Think of wood pieces—tables chair legs picture frames—as having a color. They can read as light medium or dark depending on the finish so you can't ignore them"" Liz says.

Samuel Leeds’s solicitors’ Ellisons have issued legal proceedings or threats of lawsuits against at least 15 individuals or property websites that the Guardian is aware of.

A section on Leeds’s YouTube channel which has more than 260000 subscribers is titled “Buying houses with no money” while the website of Leeds’s company Property Investors suggests: “Anybody can become financially free within 12 months or less by investing in property.” Leeds frequently criticises his detractors in videos but has also responded in other ways.

A legal letter was sent to Carrie Jones the sister of Danny Butcher a soldier from Doncaster who killed himself after paying £13000 for training with Property Investors. Butcher’s family said he was in debt before doing the training course and never made the money he thought he would from it. The letter which Jones described as a “scare tactic” accused her and other family members of involvement in a campaign of “defamation and harassment”.

Jones was unhappy that the letter referred to contact with Nick Fletcher the MP for Don Valley about her brother’s case.

“I can speak to whoever I like” she said. “I was gobsmacked and annoyed at the fact that he had the audacity to sort of send me a message to tell me to shut up when he can’t even have the decency to speak to the family of Danny. I thought that was quite shocking and disrespectful.”

Ellisons said Leeds had been advised not to speak to Butcher’s family because he had been subjected to an “unlawful campaign of defamation and harassment”.

The firm told the Guardian the letter was sent after “months of defamatory comments” by Jones which she denies. Ellisons initially offered to send the Guardian a schedule of alleged defamatory comments but later declined to do so.

The letter warned Jones about contact with Andrew Burgess and other people involved in a Facebook group concerned with Leeds who are together being sued for more than £6m by Leeds for alleged harassment and defamation. He is seeking a six-figure sum in a separate lawsuit against Vanessa Warwick the co-founder of the Property Tribes website.

Warwick who has issued a counter-claim for defamation and harassment denies the accusations and says she has nothing to do with the Facebook group despite Leeds’s suggestions. She said the volume of legal threats suggested Leeds wanted “to shut down public commentary and to send a clear message to others not to comment on social media for fear of being sued”.

She said: “The property training and wealth creation sector is completely unregulated and therefore public commentary and community-generated due diligence resources are just about the only line of consumer protection that is stopping people from being parted from their savings and pensions or going further into debt.”

Burgess’s crowdfunding page says he attended an open day and felt “uncomfortable with the exceptionally hard sell and how some of the people I had spoken to who were in desperate situations had signed up for further training costing many thousands of pounds”.

Leeds’s solicitors told the Guardian: “The defendants and people incited by their Facebook group directly targeted (with direct messages telephone calls and emails) Mr Leeds his parents his siblings his business associates and his pastor … They contacted anyone that openly associated with our clients as students and tried to encourage them to distance themselves from our clients with threats of ‘they would be sorry’ if they did not. The campaign regularly included threats of violence and wishing our clients dead and included racist comments against our client’s wife.”

Warwick said: “I have never engaged in any of the conduct or behaviour so described by them.”

Burgess said: “At no time was I involved in any campaign involving threats of violence wishing Mr Leeds dead or including racist comments against Mr Leeds wife.”

A property website LandlordZONE took down content about Leeds after legal letters claiming it was defamatory.

Another action subsequently settled was brought against against Jon Holstead for alleged copyright infringement over a video in which the fellow YouTuber discussed taking out a loan to pay for a £12000 course and questioned its worth. He used clips from Leeds’s videos relying on the exception in copyright law for “fair dealing” which includes use for criticism and reviews but Ellisons disagreed.

Ellisons said: “Our clients do not consider they are ‘stifling’ legitimate commentary or criticism. They are only attempting to stop the spread of a small number of harmful untruths being spread by a small number of individuals.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxlc3RhdGUuY29tLmF1L25ld3MvamVmZmVyc29uLWZvcmQtZm91bmRlci1zaW1vbi1qZWZmZXJzb24tcmV2cy11cC1mb3ItbWVnYS1tYWx2ZXJuLWVhc3Qtc2FsZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jefferson Ford founder Simon Jefferson revs up for mega Malvern East sale - realestate.com.au,"Jefferson Ford founder and director Simon Jefferson and wife Pamela have listed their Malvern East pad.

The couple only bought the five-bedroom home at 11 Glenbrook Ave last June paying $4.454m according to CoreLogic.

They now have $4.5m-$4.95m price hopes for its sale.

Abercromby’s Armadale director Jock Langley said there had been good interest in the home built in 1978 particularly from family homebuyers.

“It’s in a family belt and there’s also excellent schools nearby … there’s a lot of pent up demand around it at this time because of its location and amenities” he said.

Mr Langley said the property’s position on the west side of the street was appealing as it had a “sun-drenched backyard”.

“It’s a house you could certainly further improve if you wanted to but it’s also comfortable as it is.”

The Jeffersons also made moves in the property market in 2014 offloading their Hawthorn home at 5 Yarra St for $4.36m.

Mr Jefferson founded Jefferson Ford in 1980 selling Ford models out of a Nepean Highway dealership in Bentleigh.

Today the company is one of the biggest and most renowned dealerships in Melbourne with 17 locations across the city dealing brands from Ford to Hyundai Mitsubishi Subaru Toyota and more.

The company has promoted and appointed new leadership within its production quality engineering logistics and finance operations.

“We remain confident that the growth opportunity for Freshpet is enormous and with that comes necessary investments in organizational capabilities in order to fulfill our potential” said Charles Norris chairman of the board at Freshpet. “Each of these changes is designed to focus more resources on the specific areas where we believe the company has the greatest opportunity to enhance its effectiveness increase its reliability and consistency of performance and deliver the Freshpet experience and service that consumers and retail partners expect.”

Effective Sept. 7 Heather Pomerantz former chief financial officer of Freshpet has stepped down. Current Vice Chairman Dick Kassar previous chief financial officer of Freshpet will serve as interim CFO while the company searches for Pomerantz’s permanent replacement.

“We are very grateful to Heather for her efforts in guiding Freshpet through the pandemic” said Billy Cyr chief executive officer of Freshpet. “During her tenure we strengthened the company’s balance sheet providing us the necessary capital to meet our long-term goals — including funding a capacity expansion plan that we expect to provide the foundation from which we can drive future growth. We believe we are well positioned to capture the substantial opportunity that lies ahead and wish Heather well in her next endeavor.”

Steve Weise executive vice president of manufacturing announced his retirement from Freshpet but will remain with the company through 2023 as a consultant to support planned improvements in Freshpet’s quality assurance programs and aid in the company’s manufacturing and supply chain operations.

Jay Dahlgren has joined the company as a consultant focusing on manufacturing and supply chain risk mitigation. Prior to Freshpet Dahlgren served as vice president of operations at The J.M. Smucker Company and also held roles at Nestle Purina and Big Heart.

Ricardo Moreno has been promoted to senior vice president of manufacturing and engineering at Freshpet. Moreno joined the company in 2020 as vice president of manufacturing a role which Freshpet is seeking to backfill as it strives to expand its manufacturing operations.

“The promotion of Ricardo along with gaining additional technical expertise across our manufacturing and supply chain are critical elements for the successful launch of our new Ennis Texas facility and the anticipated future long-term growth that it will support” Cyr said.

“Since Ricardo joined Freshpet almost two years ago he has demonstrated the leadership and technical skills necessary to drive tangible improvements to our rapidly expanding operations resulting in consistent advancements in throughput and productivity — both of which underpinned our successful refilling of the supply chain over the past several quarters” Cyr added.

The company also detailed that it has expanded Senior Vice President of Engineering Michael Hieger’s role to include capital expansion projects and engineering resources. He will report to Moreno. During his more than 15 years with Freshpet Hieger has led the development and construction of Freshpet’s Kitchens 1.0 and 2.0 in Bethlehem Penn. and the start-up of its Kitchens South facility.

“The rapid growth of our business coupled with a fluid operating environment has created a unique set of opportunities and challenges over the past two years” Cyr said. “We remain committed to meeting our objectives and are making some targeted investments to reduce volatility and establish an even greater set of capabilities to ensure that we deliver the profitable growth that we believe is inherent in this business.”

The goal is to take “an age-old brand story and tell it through brand new technology” says Resh Sidhu global director of Arcadia Snap’s creative studio for branded AR. Vogue and Snap will promote the Vogue World event via two lenses inspired by and branded Vogue that can be used worldwide: “A New Stage” inspired by the Vogue World runway allows people to bring versions of the staging to their own environment while “Lit Up” enables selfies that “reflect the runway” through a virtual glow based on the sunset and moonrise.

AR try-on has become increasingly popular in fashion and beauty. Brands began by testing makeup and face filters (such as trying on digital glasses) before graduating to items like shoes and watches. Big names including Gucci Burberry Farfetch and Prada have tested shoppable AR try-on and Snap has worked to position itself as a go-to partner for the industry’s AR endeavours. In June British Vogue brought a Snapchat experience to Cannes Lions that let visitors try on digital items from brands such as Versace and Dior.

Brands have also tested Snap’s ability to add a “digital layer” to the world around us as Snap global product lead in AR Carolina Arguelles Navas has said to Vogue Business through enhancements such as in-store augmentations (such as Nike’s AR archives experience with “artefacts” unlocked via QR codes) or delivering a stack of Louis Vuitton luggage cases.

As physical fashion weeks reconvene in global cities pop-ups and shows such as AR platform Zero10’s digital retail store in New York and AR fashion artist Doddz’s digital in-person show are expected to take advantage of improvements in AR technology. The Vogue World experience for example uses Snap’s ground and sky segmentation technology and Snap recently made its try-on tech available to external apps and developers in a bid to deepen relationships with brands and retailers. Snap has been a clear leader in using AR for social commerce and now sees more than 6 billion AR Lens plays daily. As of Snap’s Q1 2022 more than 250 million people used Snap’s AR shopping lenses every day on average.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFkd2Vlay5jb20vc29jaWFsLW1hcmtldGluZy9zbmFwLXBvd2Vycy1hci1leHBlcmllbmNlcy1mb3Itdm9ndWUtd29ybGQtZXZlbnQtYXQtbmV3LXlvcmstZmFzaGlvbi13ZWVrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Snap Powers AR Experiences for Vogue World Event at New York Fashion Week,"Vogue is celebrating its 130th year with the Vogue World event Monday (Sept. 12) during New York Fashion Week  and the iconic fashion publisher teamed up with Snap Inc. on several custom-built augmented reality experiences tied to the event.

The Skywalk lens—which incorporates Snap AR technology including sky segmentation and surface tracking—will transform the show’s setting through AR synchronized with the timing of the overall production.

Attendees using the lens will see blossoming flowers emerging from the ground as models walk down the runway and those flowers will float into the sky as a glowing moon appears.

During the finale the petals will fall like confetti at the end of the catwalk.

Netflix is the dominant streaming service. So why is it changing its model? Entertainment | What the ‘Fallout’ show gets right about the post-apocalyptic video game series The game has been garnering interest because it’s developed by “Heartstone” co-creator Ben Brode and several former members of Blizzard. From its first reveal the game appeared to have a level of visual polish that separated it from the crowd and it looks like the developer Second Dinner is making the most out of the Marvel license. They’re playing with a lot of the characters and relationships in the comic book universe.

“Marvel Snap” features more than 150 cards at launch and has more than 80 locations that play a pivotal role in the battler. Players use their hero or villain cards to control locations and the goal is to dominate at least two of three locales in a six-turn match. Because each card has a different ability and stats that’s easier said than done. Players must also understand that only four cards can be played at each location and these locales have their own traits that impact the field of play.

It sounds a little complicated for novices but once you see Brode explain the concepts you can see the potential for fun and the depth. The Snap part of the game almost acts like upping the ante in Poker. By driving up the stakes players can bluff their way out of a loss or they can trick an opponent into risking more Cosmic Cubes that’s the currency determining a player’s rank.



There are a lot of elements that make “Marvel Snap” feel different from Brode’s previous work. The fact that players drop cards at the same time is interesting and there’s more of a Poker element. At the same time matches thankfully run quickly — they’re three minutes at the most — so it’s a good pick-and-play diversion if you’re stuck in a line or waiting for a friend.

The big question though is whether the collectible trading card game can reach the same level of success as Blizzard’s game. Second Dinner and players around the globe can find out when the game launches in 13 languages on mobile and early access on PC.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay8zYW0vY2VsZWJyaXR5LW5ld3MvY29sZWVuLXJvb25leS1zaGFyZXMtc25hcC1mb3VyLTI3OTQ3NTY00gFXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWlycm9yLmNvLnVrLzNhbS9jZWxlYnJpdHktbmV3cy9jb2xlZW4tcm9vbmV5LXNoYXJlcy1zbmFwLWZvdXItMjc5NDc1NjQuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coleen Rooney shares snap of all four of her boys in uniform as they head back to school,"Coleen and Wayne Rooney leave court in London on May 17th

Coleen shared photos from the holiday on social media last month teasing that they had quality family time on the ""quick trip"" before her and the kids returned to the UK.

The former WAG 43 told how they had all 'rode the storm' and were focusing on protecting the 'two most important people in our lives' - their daughter Liberty 19 and son Zachary 15.

Earlier this week Ryan 48 said he was 'obviously disappointed' that a retrial has been ordered over allegations of domestic abuse against his ex-girlfriend Kate Greville as he faces waiting at least ten months to learn his fate.

Ryan's trial came at an already difficult time for Stacey - who has accused her ex boyfriend Max George of cheating on her with his Strictly co-star and now girlfriend Maisie Smith.

In Stacey's latest post she shared a snap of Ryan - who is a Welsh football coach and former player - in his Wales kit for the national team as he beamed for a snap with his brood.

The kids looked adorable in their matching football outfits as they beamed for the camera and cuddled up to their dad.

She penned in the caption: 'The last five weeks have been pretty rough but we've rode the storm for now.

Former couple: Ryan and Stacey were married for ten years between 2007 and 2017 and still co-parent their two children (pictured in 2010)

'Thank you to both of our amazing families and friends for supporting and helping us protect the two most important people in our lives.'

Ryan and Stacey were married for ten years between 2007 and 2017 and still co-parent their two children.

Earlier this week Ryan said he was 'obviously disappointed' that a retrial has been ordered over allegations of domestic abuse against his ex-girlfriend Kate Greville as he faces waiting at least ten months to learn his fate.

But the former Manchester United and Wales footballer added: 'I am confident that justice will eventually be done and my name will be cleared of all the allegations.'

Split: Ryan's trial came at an already difficult time for Stacey - who has accused her ex boyfriend Max George of cheating on her with his Strictly co-star and now girlfriend Maisie Smith (Max and Stacey pictured)

Giggs will now have to stand trial again facing charges of assault and coercive and controlling behaviour.

In a statement Giggs thanked 'my legal team my mum my children my girlfriend Zara as well as my closest friends for their support throughout this period'.

The retrial decision came after the Crown Prosecution Service decided it would pursue a prosecution against Giggs after a jury failed to reach a verdict last week following a three-week trial.

The former Wales coach is accused of assaulting Greville 38 and her 26-year-old sister Emma amid a booze-fuelled argument at Giggs' multi-million pound home in Worsley Greater Manchester.

He also stands accused of coercive and controlling behaviour towards PR executive Greville over three years - charges which he denies.

It comes after Stacey accused her ex Max 33 of cheating on her with Maisie Smith 21.

Stacey is allegedly furious that her former partner and his Strictly co-star are now dating publicly just days after they split.

In a conversation with one of her friends she detailed her heartbreak over the situation and explained how she feels 'betrayed' by The Wanted singer.

The Sun reported that Stacey told a pal: 'To see them dating publicly so quickly after I dumped him is like a dagger to the heart.'

She continued: 'Max cheated on me with Maisie. I asked him about her but he denied anything had happened.

'After everything I've done for him I cannot believe he would be so rude and disrespectful. He's a lying dog. I feel betrayed.'

She then went on to claim Max has changed since they first got together and he's now 'obsessed with fame'.

The report claims that Max and Stacey's first split in March this year was due to Stacey becoming suspicious about her boyfriend's close relationship with Maisie who he had spent the previous two months with on the Strictly tour.

After a few days apart the couple reconciled before Stacey reportedly dumped Max on July 25 after the Maisie rumours refused to die down.

Despite splitting Max and Stacey continued to spend time together with the former boybander a regular guest at Stacey's home as he continued to deny he had cheated on her with Maisie.

It was on July 28 that Max jetted to on holiday to Portugal to meet up with Maisie and mutual friends. According to Stacey he continued to deny he was with his Strictly co-star telling her in phone calls that he was in Spain.

They have since been spotted kissing in public have gone Instagram official and reportedly moved in together.

Mailonline contacted representatives for Stacey Max and Maisie for comment at the time.

Stacey and Max initially got together in 2018 with Max previously calling Stacey 'the one' after meeting way back in 2011 at V festival.

The Wanted singer was dating actress Michelle Keegan at the time while Stacey was still married to Manchester United player Ryan."

Before the days of regular curbside trash service a major portion of household trash was burned in small concrete cinder block brick or metal incinerators in suburban and rural backyards.

In the big cities many apartment buildings businesses schools and factories had their own incinerators fed and tended by a maintenance person.

From the earliest days of community living humans have struggled with managing their garbage sewage and discarded junk.

The great ancient cities became overwhelmed by trash as populations grew and they began to require residents to haul garbage a minimum distance from the city where it could rot and stink with fewer complaints.

During the Industrial Revolution from about 1760 to 1840 garbage and waste became untenable particularly in large European cities. It was during this period that large cities began creating municipal codes to manage waste.

It seems difficult to believe but there was not a direct health-risk correlation between garbage sewage and dirty water until the mid-1800s.

Air quality was identified as a health concern in very early societies because of the immediate effects of breathing smoke and contaminated air.

Southern California’s population began booming in the 1880s and the continued explosive growth created complex waste-disposal problems. They were handled in a haphazard and disconnected fashion until the mid-1900s.

The prefabricated backyard incinerator was introduced in the late 1800s and it became a simple efficient solution to the ancient problem of garbage disposal.

In the 1890s Los Angeles was experiencing growing pains and in 1896 the city’s board of health determined their garbage collection contract was not keeping up with trash generation. As a result the board recommended modifications to the garbage pickup process and began allowing residents to burn their own garbage in home incinerators.

San Bernardino became an early adopter of mandatory garbage pickup in 1910 when the city passed a municipal ordinance requiring all homes and businesses within the city to have garbage hauled away by “the regular garbage man.”

Cement contractor James McNair won the contract with the city to pick up the garbage and he was preparing to construct a large incinerator to burn the material. During the early 1900s garbage contractors often paid the city for the right to pick up the trash and they made a profit from recycling discarded materials. McNair’s contract required him to pay San Bernardino $100 per year.

The early garbage collection companies used open horse-drawn wagons to collect the waste and haul it to a designated dump site usually on the outskirts of town.

In 1912 the city of Venice purchased a 3-ton Pope-Hartford electric-powered garbage truck for $3750 and it became one of the earliest cities in California to operate a powered garbage truck. Mechanized garbage trucks started to become popular in the 1920s.

As garbage service became more complex and costly cities began charging residents fees for collection. Some residents rebelled saying their home incinerators were adequate to handle their garbage and said they would haul their garbage that couldn’t be burned to the local dump.

Hickey-Carroll & Company of Los Angeles began selling “Peerless” incinerators around 1920 and they became one of the biggest suppliers in Southern California. The company had showrooms in downtown LA for their concrete and cast-iron units that started at $5 delivered.

Some cities in Southern California including San Bernardino were using private contractors who hauled garbage to hog farms in rural areas where the animals would eat the discarded material.

This solved some disposal problems but caused several others including the proliferation of rats flies foul odors and illnesses in people from eating under-cooked pork that had been fed trash.

In 1924 San Bernardino County passed an emergency ordinance that prohibited the movement of garbage within the county which effectively made each city responsible for handling their own material. This change caused the cities to reevaluate processes.

Charging residents for garbage collection became routine in the 1920s and in December 1928 the city of Redlands negotiated a new contract that would cost each family 50 cents per month for twice-weekly curbside pickup. The new contract also allowed the contractor to operate a hog farm in Mentone that would consume some of the garbage. For residents on a tight budget the trusty backyard incinerator was still an option that could eliminate the monthly garbage collection fee.

By the 1940s air pollution in the Los Angeles basin Orange County and the Inland Empire had become a major problem and health officials were looking for the source of the pollution which had become known as “smog.”

In 1950 Los Angeles County Smog-Control Director Gordon P. Larson told the Los Angeles city board that the “backyard incinerator must go” if smog is to be reduced. Officials around the state joined in the push to ban backyard incinerators.

Los Angeles County was first to enact a county-wide ban on backyard incinerators in October 1957. But many residents who regularly used incinerators to save money cried foul and protested the ban.

According to a report in the Feb. 15 1958 issue of the San Bernardino Daily Sun laws enacted in Los Angeles County had reduced pollution dramatically.

Oil refinery fumes were cut from 800 tons per day to 150 industrial smoke fumes were cut from 100 tons to 25 and pollution from backyard incinerators was cut from 800 tons to nearly zero by banning the use of the county’s 1.5 million backyard burners.

The elephant in the room was of course the automobile and reducing exhaust pollution from cars would take decades to accomplish.

Municipalities and counties followed suit with bans on incinerators and the residential mainstay of garbage disposal began to disappear from backyards.

A few backyard incinerators linger today as reminders of our former regular smokey skies.

The tournament will resume on Saturday.

All but a half dozen professional golf tournaments — out of hundreds of events held each year — rely on a marquee sponsor and dozens of other co-sponsors to pay millions of dollars for each event to happen.

There are a few notable exceptions: the Masters the United States Open the P.G.A. Championship and the British Open.

But even an event as prestigious as this week’s BMW PGA Championship at the Wentworth Club in Surrey England — one of the top events on the DP World Tour — relies on the German carmaker plus another dozen sponsors like Zoom Rolex and Hilton to fund the event pay the players and have something left over for charity.

There’s just one problem. The BMW PGA Championship will have more than a dozen players from the rival Saudi Arabia-backed LIV Golf series in the field including fan favorites Ian Poulter and Lee Westwood and several players that could win the event like Kevin Na Patrick Reed and Martin Kaymer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vcmVzdGF1cmFudGJ1c2luZXNzb25saW5lLmNvbS9maW5hbmNpbmcvdGlueS1zb3V0aGVybi1jYWxpZm9ybmlhLXJhbWVuLWNvbmNlcHQtbWFrZXMtaXRzLXB1YmxpYy1tYXJrZXQtZGVidXTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A tiny Southern California ramen concept makes its public market debut,"Yoshiharu Ramen a tiny California chain made its public debut on Friday. / Photograph courtesy of Yoshiharu.

A soon-to-be nine-unit ramen chain based in Southern California made its debut on the Nasdaq Capital Market on Friday hoping to raise more than $12 million for expansion with an initial public offering.

Yoshiharu Global Co. offered 2.9 million shares of Class A common stock priced at $4 per share but began trading at $5.20 under the ticker symbol “YOSH.”

Based in Buena Park Calif. Yoshiharu was founded by James Chae now CEO in 2016 and the concept has expanded mostly around and outside Los Angeles with eight units and one under development.

Known for rich pork-broth-based tonkotsu ramen is at the core of the menu but Yoshiharu also offers sushi bento box meals dumplings and other dishes that appeal to what the company describes as a growing appetite for Japanese cuisine.

The IPO was first announced in January. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission the chain’s revenue grew to $4.4 million for the nine months ended Sept. 30 2021 up from $1.9 million for the same period in 2020—though Yoshiharu reported a net loss of $42968 for those nine months in 2021.

In the S1 registration in January the company said it had continued to experience negative cash flow from operations and had significant accumulated debt ($2.6 million as of Sept. 30 2021) which raised some doubt about the company’s ability to continue.

But the filing also indicated the chain was recovering from the hit of the pandemic. The company expected to be operating 14 corporate locations before the calendar year-end and the company sees potential to grow to 250 units domestically and 750 restaurants internationally.

A franchise program is expected to be launched before the end of 2022 and the company is also positioning for a potential instant ramen goods line in grocery stores or even possibly small-format kiosks in stores offering a limited menu.

Yoshiharu is not the first relatively small Japanese chain to dive into the public markets.

Kura Sushi USA had success with an IPO in 2019 when it had only 22 units though it is a subsidiary of a 500-unit Japan-based chain. For the third quarter ended May 31 Kura Sushi USA had 37 units and reported $38 million in sales.

Derrick Palmer's campaign base was a Staten Island bus stop.

For nearly a year he would pitch up at the stop day and night with two tables and a tent along with other leaders of the Amazon Labor Union.

They held bonfires toasted marshmallows and waited up at 4 a.m. with breakfast sandwiches to catch workers coming off the night shift nearby at JFK8 Amazon's main New York distribution center where Palmer works as a packer and encourage them to sign up to support a trade union.

On windy winter nights the tent would often blow away.

Their efforts were rewarded in April this year when JFK8 which has more than 8000 workers became the first and only Amazon warehouse in the US to unionize following a vote — the process to formally establish a union by showing enough workers support it.

This year has seen a wave of union activism after decades of declining membership.

A flurry of workers have won elections to form unions in industries that have never had them including at more than 200 Starbucks stores and at Apple Trader Joe's and the outdoor store REI.

Union-representation petitions filed with the National Labor Relations Board jumped almost 60% in the nine months that ended in June. A Gallup poll last year found support for unions to be at its highest since the '60s.

But the ordinary people leading this workers-rights revival have their work cut out.

American corporations often fiercely resist union efforts. A 2019 report by the Economic Policy Institute estimated that US companies spend nearly $340 million a year on ""union avoidance"" consultants and illegal firings are alleged to happen in up to 30% of union-election campaigns.

Insider spoke with people organizing workers at Amazon Trader Joe's Target Wells Fargo and Starbucks in conversations spread over several weeks about what drives them to try to unionise in America today. Some have had their unions recognised others are still campaigning.

Derrick Palmer Amazon New York







Derrick Palmer and his best friend led a strike at Amazon's Staten Island warehouse in March 2020 in protest at the company's safety measures after a worker contracted COVID-19.

His friend Chris Smalls was fired after the strike though he remains the president of the Amazon Labor Union they then founded together. (Amazon says it fired Smalls for violating its quarantine policy. Smalls disputes this.)

But Palmer who is now 33 kept his job.

He told Insider he felt no sense of direction before unionizing going through a string of temporary warehouse roles before he joined Amazon.

""I've been in their shoes"" he says of finding purpose in supporting his Amazon colleagues. ""I know what it's like to be unmotivated — I know what it's like to not be taken seriously.""

Palmer told Insider the union started small with money from a GoFundMe page.

He said he spent up to eight hours a day on top of his 40-hour workweek working on the campaign ahead of the vote.

""I had a lot of sleepless nights"" he said later adding: ""We were building a community and I felt like the last thing we wanted to do was let them down.""

Erika Ramirez/Insider

Speaking with Insider while heating up some chicken and rice during his shift at JFK8 Palmer said Amazon created a ""climate of fear"" after the strike. He later added that Amazon engaged in ""union-busting"" including sending text messages to workers encouraging them to vote against joining the ALU and posting anti-union messages in bathroom stalls.

An Amazon representative told Insider that ""it's important that everyone understands the facts about joining a union and the election process itself.""

Amazon has since tried to overturn the vote with objections including taking issue with organizers' handing out marijuana during campaigning. The Amazon representative said the company has filed evidence that the ALU ""improperly suppressed and influenced the vote.""

Palmer said he believed the company was monitoring his actions and tweets. But ""fear is the last thing on my mind"" he told Insider.

The union is trying to secure a contract with Amazon to bargain for things like higher wages increased job security and cutting back on mandatory overtime.

Tensions are said to be high at the warehouse and the two sides have yet to engage. No other Amazon centers have unionized despite efforts around the US.

But for the organizers it's still a time to celebrate. Palmer's co-leader Smalls met President Joe Biden in May at an event where the president called him ""my kind of trouble.""

Palmer's mother raised him by herself. He says he's changed a lot since childhood. ""I was a very small kid very soft-spoken. I used to walk with my head down. I didn't have the confidence that I do now"" he said.

""I feel like that relates to Amazon workers now.

""It's like I'm talking to my old self saying 'You've got to keep your head up you've got to fight back you've got to stand your ground.

'You've got to let your presence be known.'""

Adam Ryan Target Virginia

""I've always had the itch to organize"" Adam Ryan told Insider. ""If I'm not doing it I don't feel okay about myself.""

Ryan started working at Target because of a rumor he heard in a trailer park.

He was asking the park's residents about housing issues as part of a workers-rights campaign when one told him about a manager at Target who was widely accused of abusive behavior including sexual harassment.

He got a job at the store in his hometown of Christiansburg Virginia in 2017 with the goal of forcing the manager out. Four months later he organized a strike that he says triggered an internal investigation into the claims. The accused manager was later fired.

Ryan 34 is a serial campaigner. He was trained in organizing in 2011 and has pushed to unionize at every job since then.

He grew up in a conservative working-class family as the youngest of four brothers in what he describes as a ""small ranch-style house."" His father worked at an Army ammunition plant and his mother was a school cafeteria worker for over 20 years.

He told Insider he ""didn't feel poor per se"" but felt an expectation that ""if you want anything you're going to have to get a job and work for it.""

Things were tense between Ryan and his family from his teenage years into his 20s. But his involvement in unions has helped them reconnect.

""We're in a common struggle and we're dealing with a lot of the same issues"" he said adding that his efforts had inspired his brother to push for unionization in his job as a wildland firefighter.

He calls unionizing ""the only power working-class people have.""

Alycee Byrd for Insider

Ryan's job involves unloading stock deliveries and putting products on the sales floor. He said Target began monitoring workers more closely after the strike he organized including by bringing in managers from other stores to surveil workers and question them individually. He has filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board over this.

Ryan said management had grilled him too: He said after he invited coworkers to labor-rights meetings he was pulled into a meeting with management and told not to do that. ""It's definitely anxiety-inducing — it's stressful"" he later said.

Target did not respond to Insider's request for comment.

He started calling for a union election with the wider campaign Target Workers Unite in 2019. ""I don't want to see something I've invested a number of years in just like dissipate overnight if I happen to leave"" he said.

He filed a petition for a union election in May of this year but it didn't have enough signatures which he blames on confusion over ""on-demand workers"" which he says the organizers didn't realize counted as employees.

He is pushing for benefits like hazard pay for workers who get sick with COVID-19 and seniority pay to reward long-term employees.

Campaigning has taken an emotional toll. Ryan moved to the countryside two years ago and says he finds comfort in the quiet of his garden. He said he felt drained by what he described as ""constant infighting"" in labor organizing.

He describes himself as ""a disgruntled person"" who struggles with ""how to motivate people when I'm generally very frustrated and upset with how things are in the world.""

But he argues the changes at his store so far have exposed ""cracks"" at Target. ""It shows that even if you're small you can still pack a punch"" he said ""and you can punch above your weight.""

Jessie McCool Wells Fargo Missouri

Like many Americans in office jobs Jessie McCool worked from home during the coronavirus pandemic. She's a senior compliance officer at Wells Fargo the US's third-biggest bank.

She told Insider she took one meeting while sitting on the diving board of her backyard pool last year so she could keep an eye on her child who was swimming.

She said she asked her manager whether she could have her camera switched off on the call but was told to switch it on. She said she was later given an informal warning without her manager being present accusing her of ""disruptive behavior that could have diverted attention"" on the call.

McCool describes this as an example of remote-working policies being applied inconsistently saying she saw someone on a comparable Zoom call running on a treadmill in a bathrobe weeks later. (McCool said her manager at the time confirmed this other employee received no warning.)

McCool said she wanted to lead union efforts to try to ""take back some of the control"" that she said senior management had ""run awry"" with recalling witnessing a colleague reduced to tears by her superiors on another video call in 2020.

Joe Martinez for Insider

There's a growing push to unionize across Wells Fargo where McCool 42 has worked for 10 years but no union has yet been recognised by the company.

She leads unionizing efforts at the Missouri headquarters and says remote communication during the pandemic helped workers start a union drive across Wells Fargo's US offices though her group hasn't decided whether to be part of the wider campaign or to form an independent union.

Characterizing herself as ""confrontational"" McCool said she challenged people in her work and personal life.

""If I see something that I don't agree with I will just stand up and say it and I think in a way people have begun to rely on me to do things like that"" she said.

She said she's lobbying for more transparency around policies and procedures equitable pay and fair treatment for employees.

McCool told Insider she was referred to as a ""diversity hire"" by a human-resources officer in an initial interview. She describes herself as having Hispanic Jewish and Middle Eastern heritage.

The banking giant has come under scrutiny over scandals including holding job interviews for ""diverse"" candidates despite already filling the roles with other candidates as first reported by The New York Times. A spokesperson for Wells Fargo told Insider that diverse representation across the company has increased year-on-year since 2020.

McCool said she had a six-month internal battle with HR after being asked to remove a reference to the union in the headline bar of her Skype profile something she argues is a federally protected right. ""My coworkers are also having similar experiences"" she added. She was ultimately allowed to use the tagline.

The spokesperson for Wells Fargo told Insider it doesn't comment on ""specific personal matters"".

Outside her day job McCool is a rally race-car driver model and burlesque performer.

Activism was part of her upbringing. ""Everybody deserves a community that will uphold them and I think I just fell into that"" she said speaking of the punk marches in Pittsburgh that she said she went to as a child in the early 1990s.

""My mother was always like: 'You stand up for what's right — it doesn't matter whether you're popular'"" she said.

Jamie Edwards Trader Joe's Massachusetts

""I know what it's like to be trapped at a job"" said Jamie Edwards who worked strenuous hours with long commutes across five other retail jobs before joining a Trader Joe's store in Hadley Massachusetts.

""When I'm employed at a place where there are issues I'm always thinking about the fact that not everyone has the ability to just easily go find another job"" Edwards added.

Edwards who is nonbinary and uses the pronouns they/them is a lead organizer at the Trader Joe's that in July became the chain's first location to unionize. A second followed in August at the chain which has more than 500 US locations.

They said they grew up ""idolizing too many radicals"" but viewed unionizing as a ""bare minimum"" for working-class people's well-being.

""I think that organizing a union is not really the most radical thing someone could do"" they said. ""It's a very basic thing.""

Edwards celebrated their 33rd birthday in May. The next day they said they were sent home from their job at Trader Joe's for wearing a pro-union pin on their uniform something that is generally not allowed under the National Labor Relations Act according to the National Labor Relations Board.

Simon Simard for Insider

Edwards says efforts to create a union were driven mainly by safety concerns.

Though Trader Joe's enforced mask wearing through some of the pandemic Edwards said they had felt unsafe at times for example early on when they say the chain discouraged workers from wearing masks and gloves out of fear this would ""scare"" customers. Trader Joe's did not respond to Insider's request for comment.

Their co-organizers at the store have also said that though the store followed policies set by the local health board they felt masks were dropped too quickly once vaccinations became available and the company didn't make them aware of a state law mandating paid time off for COVID-19-related absences (a representative for Trader Joe's told the New York Times this account was incorrect).

Edwards got their first job when they were 17. They have been at Trader Joe's for nine years.

Speaking with Insider on their day off Edwards said that during the campaign they had feared misinformation was being spread about the union including rumors that unionized workers would be paid less.

""I've stopped engaging with certain people who have shown themselves not to be acting in good faith because I feel like the purpose of it is to take time away from me actually organizing"" they added.

Edwards works night shifts and describes themself as a socialist who has always been pro-union. They had already attempted once before to unionize at the store.

With the milestone of formal recognition achieved they plan to keep working to try to improve life for colleagues.

""I'm always of the mindset that I should exhaust my options at trying to make the workplace better before leaving"" they said ""if only for the fact that there's still going to be people who are working there who are going to have to deal with it.""

Lindsey Price outside a Starbucks after the company fired her in April. Meron Menghistab for Insider

Lindsey Price Starbucks Seattle

Lindsey Price worked for Starbucks for 17 years until she was fired in April.

Price argues she was fired because she was helping to organize workers at her store in Seattle's Eastlake neighborhood where she worked as a shift supervisor.

Soon after her team's petition for a union election went public Starbucks fired her citing an incident where she had found the door to her store unlocked one morning with the lock dislodged.

Price told Insider the door was often left unlocked after deliveries were made to the store and the lock often dislodged. Starbucks Workers United said there were no complaints about her for nearly nine years before she lost her job.

A Starbucks spokesperson told Insider that Price was fired for putting her team ""in an unsafe situation"" because she failed to call 911 as the scene could have been a burglary. They added that Starbucks denies firing any workers for invovlement in unions.

Price's old store is now officially unionized. She describes safety at Starbucks as a key concern telling Insider that her store caught on fire because of faults with the electrical systems in September 2021 and workers were tasked with finding their own shifts at other stores when it closed a few months later.

""We didn't feel taken care of"" Price said adding in another conversation that she felt ""completely on my own.""

She said her manager once asked her to clean up a ""significant"" amount of blood without protective clothing while working at a Starbucks store in Costa Mesa California in 2012 or 2013 after someone came into the store with a gunshot wound. She said she ultimately didn't clean it up following instructions from the police.

Meron Menghistab for Insider

Price 38 says she's always been ""a parent"" to her colleagues and has acted as a go-between with managers.

Yet she hasn't always supported unions. She chuckles when saying her opinions have shifted like ""night and day.""

""I was raised thinking that unions were not helpful"" she told Insider.

Price's father worked a white-collar job and her mother held a cool view toward unions after her own father had experience with a union that he said treated him ""terribly.""

But she got involved to advocate on behalf of her colleagues and looking back wishes her store had unionized earlier saying her career path ""could have changed drastically had I felt taken care of and listened to.""

Being fired felt like a bad breakup Price says.

She has a new job at the Seattle Public Library and is in graduate school studying library science. There's relief in her voice when she says she now has ""an actual career path which I've never felt like before.""

But she says she will still be part of the Eastlake Starbucks union bargaining committee when it is set up and feels connected to her former colleagues saying she knows ""that feeling of just hopelessness I guess that some people can feel working there and that I know I felt many times.""

""I think that's what makes me want to be on a bargaining committee"" she said ""and continue to try to help as much as I can.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL3BvcHVsYXItc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWNvZmZlZS1kcmluay1mYWNlcy1yZWNhbGzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Popular Starbucks Coffee Drink Faces Recall,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/popular-starbucks-coffee-drink-faces-recall on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL3BvcHVsYXItc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWNvZmZlZS1kcmluay1mYWNlcy1yZWNhbGzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9zdGFyYnVja3MtdW5pb24tZHJpdmUtaW52ZXN0b3ItZGF5LXNlcHRlbWJlci0xMTAwMzM3MzMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Starbucks finds itself in the middle of a union firestorm,"How did Starbucks arguably one of the nation’s most forward-thinking companies led by Howard Schultz arguably one of the nation’s most progressive CEOs become a poster child of anti-unionism?

As you may know Starbucks has become the subject of a small but significant organizing campaign by Starbucks Workers United which is affiliated with the SEIU or Service Employees International Union.

This movement has unionized 210 of the company’s 9000 U.S. stores about 2.3% with another 75 or so up for a vote.

Starbucks led by Schultz has been vigorously fighting the union’s efforts. Charges and counter-charges have become heated. Expect at least some update from the company at Starbucks’ investor day set for this coming Tuesday.

It seems like a strange state of affairs. Hobby Lobby or Walmart fighting unions sure. But Starbucks?

To a certain extent Starbucks is a victim of its own success. Under Schultz the company has put into place some of the most generous benefits and work policies of any company in America. This includes higher wages comprehensive health care coverage stock options (including for part-timers) and free college tuition.

As a result Starbucks has attracted a better-educated workforce which turns over less often than at a typical QSR with some data showing a 65% turnover rate below the 150%-400% seen at most peers. Arguably this more engaged workforce has more skin in the game and is more willing to fight for change rather than just quit.

“I think it’s the case that people expect more from us” a Starbucks insider told me. “We have had some foot faults but I think we are held to a higher standard and we accept that.”

It’s also the case that the world has changed.

Schultz — who declined to comment for this story — seemed to suggest as much to the New York Times in June saying in an interview: “…the truth is those benefits as good as they are and were are not good enough for the employee of today primarily because Gen Z has a different view of the world. And also because the government has not provided them with a pathway that they believe they deserve.”

The pandemic factors into this as well.

“We started organizing in August of last year” says Casey Moore a barista and Starbucks Workers United member from Buffalo where the first store was unionized last fall.

“There was a group of us kind of coming out of the pandemic feeling very overworked and underpaid. We were called essential workers"" Moore said. ""But we didn't feel like we actually had the resources or the support from the company that we felt was essential.”

Story continues

“People love working at Starbucks” says Chris Chafe a strategic advisor to the Starbucks Workers United campaign. “And the company did do a lot of things to be intentionally inclusive and welcoming to a lot of different kinds of workers in a way that was pretty unique in American culture and society and business.”

The problem Chafe says is that “Starbucks turned its back on strong practices” during that pandemic.

""[Starbucks'] workforce is simply not willing on the other side of the pandemic to be mistreated by a company that prior to the last couple of years had made a different kind of effort to engage with them"" Chafe said. ""And so they're looking for a strong serious real voice at the table to work with the company to make it a better place to work again.”

But union activists also say that Schultz and Starbucks are behaving unethically and even illegally when it comes to anti-union statements closing stores and dismissing pro-union employees. The company denies those charges.

Starbucks says not only is the number of disgruntled employees small but its workforce is being whipped up by activists who have their own agenda — which speaks to the point that unions aren’t necessarily the most progressive constituency in American society. In other words saying a progressive company like Starbucks is at loggerheads with unions isn’t necessarily a contradiction.

What about Schultz’s background? Is there some sort of Freudian element that would make him anti-union? To the contrary it seems. Schultz grew up in a poor working class neighborhood in Brooklyn which I visited with him 18 years ago.

This from a story I wrote about Schultz in Fortune back in 2004: “Schultz frequently tells a story about coming home one day as a boy to find his father Fred — who worked a variety of blue-collar jobs to keep his family going — laid up on the couch with a broken ankle. His father [who was not in a union] couldn't work. He lost his job and he had no medical benefits. The family's tight finances became even tighter. 'I will never forget that episode' says Schultz. 'I never want that to happen to our employees.' That's why thousands of part-time Starbucks workers have full medical benefits.”

It seems that what irks Schultz isn’t paying (unionized) employees more money it’s sacrificing a direct connection with them.

In his 2012 biography 'Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time' Schultz wrote: ""I was convinced that under my leadership employees would come to realize that I would listen to their concerns. If they had faith in me and my motives they wouldn’t need a union.""

In fact there has been unionizing activity at Starbucks going back to the 1980s first with the United Food and Commercial Workers and later with the Industrial Workers of the World (the Wobblies!) but Schultz was able to push the unions out. That is until this recent more successful foray by the SEIU. A move that apparently compelled Schultz — who had been CEO from 1986 to 2000 then came back from 2008 to 2017 — to return again this past March when a company source says stores were voting on unionization at a 25-per-week clip.

Union sources say there must be discomfort felt by Starbucks’ board members including board chair and Ariel Investments co-CEO Mellody Hobson and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. Maybe maybe not.

In August Starbucks union members in Buffalo leafleted a preseason Buffalo Bills-Denver Broncos game calling out Hobson who is part of the Broncos' new ownership group.

“Hobson has a long and generally positive relationship with Workers United and its predecessor unions” said union organizer Chafe. “Her firm counts the National Retirement Fund the pension fund for that union among the very early institutional investors who showed trust and faith in her and [Ariel founder] John Rogers many years ago.”

As for Microsoft in June Microsoft President Brad Smith said in a company blog post Microsoft will not resist unionization efforts. The company also entered into a labor neutrality agreement with the Communications Workers of America according to Reuters ""allowing employees to 'freely and fairly' make [a] choice about union representation."" It’s worth pointing out though that Microsoft may have a much smaller labor footprint to organize than Starbucks does. Still it seems like an astute and maybe even conciliatory move by the tech giant.

What does this mean for Starbucks’ investors? The stock has underperformed the market over the past year and matched the S&P over the past five years.

Is that because of unionizing? Or because of the company's resistance to the union? Probably neither.

The company has myriad other problems/opportunities like supply chain and sourcing China and competition which no doubt will come up on Tuesday along with a company insider says ""all kinds of initiatives modernizing the partner (employee) and customer experience.""

Layered on to all of this is the fact that the company has a new CEO Laxman Narasimhan soon to be in training with Schultz and who will take the reins fully next April 1st.

Could Narasimhan be one the one who makes peace with the union? It likely will have to be.

Schultz told Andrew Ross Sorkin this week he is never coming back.

That may be music to the union's ears but perhaps not to most Starbucks employees — or customers and shareholders either.

Edwin Rosario a manager at the Five Guys restaurant in Middleton said the store at 517 State St. closed on Aug. 28.

“The infrastructure didn’t support the location anymore” said Rosario who sometimes worked at that shop.

He said the company closed the store because it was in an older building with tenants above it and there were often problems with the pipes.

Rosario said that sometimes the water would get shut off in the building causing the restaurant to close abruptly so when time came to renew the lease the company decided against it.

He said business was on an upswing and the restaurant was getting busier. “They were just more worried about the quality and the upkeep of it.”

The space housed the store Pipefitter before it moved across the street.

Five Guys is an East Coast-based franchise that was started in Virginia and serves hamburgers grilled cheese hot dogs and french fries.

Rosario said he doesn’t know whether anything else is set to go into the space.

“It’s just kind of worn down and old” he said. “So instead of investing into it they’re gonna invest into another new property.”

Rosario said the Middleton restaurant and the shop near East Towne Mall aren’t in danger of closing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vZ29wc3VzcG9ydHMuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMi85LzkvZmllbGQtaG9ja2V5LW5vLTgtcGVubi1zdGF0ZS1kb3ducy1uby0xMi1zdC1qb3NlcGhzLWZvci10aHJpbGxpbmctMi0xLXJvYWQtd2luLmFzcHjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,No. 8 Penn State Downs No. 12 St. Joseph's for Thrilling 2-1 Road Win,"Next Game: at Delaware 9/11/2022 | 12:00 p.m. Next Game Full Schedule Sep. 11 (Sun) / 12:00 p.m. at Delaware History

UNIVERSITY PARK Pa.; Sept. 9 2022 – The Penn State Nittany Lion field hockey team (3-1 0-0 B1G) ranked No. 8 in the NFHCA Coaches Poll used a fourth-period goal from Grace Wallis (Blue Bell Pa.) to grab a road win at No. 12 St. Joseph's (2-2) in a Keystone State non-conference game. Wallis scored with just under 9:00 to play to spark Penn State to a 2-1 victory in Philadelphia.

St. Joseph's came out and pressured Penn State at the start of the game forcing Lion goalie Brie Barraco (Allentown Pa.) into an early save and then picking up two quick penalty corners all in the first :51. The second corner led to the game's first goal a score by Leigh James off the second corner less than a minute into the game giving the Hawks and early 1-0 lead. The teams played even hockey for the next five-plus minutes. Penn State got hit with a green card with 8:35 left in the period but successfully defended the SJU player advantage. With 2:13 left in the first period Penn State picked up its first penalty corner of the game after an offensive push. Sophia Gladieux (Boyertown Pa.) had her shot off the corner offense blocked. The Nittany Lions trailed 1-0 after one period.

The Penn State offense worked the ball into the SJU circle four minutes into the second period and Gladieux had Penn State' second shot of the game sail just high. The Nittany Lions kept the pressure on the Hawks defense with an Anna Simon (Hanau Germany) shot slipping wide with 4:56 left in the first half but the Lions continued to trail by a goal. Penn State's pressure paid off with 3:12 left in the half when Carly Gannon (Havertown Pa.) scored on an assist from Mackenzie Allessie (Mount Joy Pa. to tie the game a 1-1. The Nittany Lions continued to control possession in the waning minutes of the half forcing a penalty corner. Simon and Grace Wallis (Blue Bell Pa.) shots blocked and the Nittany Lions entered halftime tied 1-1.

Penn State outshot St. Joseph's 7-2 in the first half and had a 3-2 edge in corners. Barraco had one save for Penn State while Robin Bleekemolen had one for the Hawks

The Hawks took possession early in the second half and forced a penalty corner just :46 into the third period. Mirroring the first period Barraco made a quick early save to keep the Hawks from scoring during the early press. The game moved to the middle of the third period with the team's trading possessions. St. Joseph's forced a corner with 3:14 left in the period and Barraco made a great save on a Freke Van Tilburg shot to keep the game tied. Seven seconds later SJU picked up another corner and the ensuing shot sailed wide. The teams traded shots as the clock moved below the 2:00 mark when Wallis had a shot on goal saved by Bleekemolen and the third period ended in a 1-1 tie.

For the third time in the game St. Joseph's notched the first shot of the period and for the third time Barraco knocked away the effort to keep the game tied just 2:00 into the fourth. Penn State answered with offensive of its own at the 10:00 mark with Gladieux getting a shot off slipping just wide of the cage. But Penn State kept the pressure on and took a 2-1 lead when Wallis took an assist from Jemma Punch (Queensland Australia) at the 8:51 mark to put the Nittany Lions on top. The Nittany Lions carried that lead deep into the fourth period. St. Joseph's moved the ball into the Lion circle with less than 5:00 to play and picked up a penalty corner. After a blocked shot the Hawks continued to maintain possession and forced another corner at the 2:18 mark. The Lion defense blocked the shot off the corner again and continued to hold off the Hawks to kill the clock and grab the 2-1 road win.

""This was a great win on the road against a very good team"" said Morett-Curtiss. ""We did some things well but still need to put the ball on the cage more. We'll work on that and it is something we can and will get better at. Brie Barraco played a great game for us today. She really kept us in the game in the third period and then Grace came through with a big goal for us in the fourth.""

St. Joseph's outshot Penn State 12-11 over the course of the game and had an 8-3 edge in penalty corners. Barraco had five saves for the Nittany Lions while Bleekemolen had two for SJU.

Penn State is 3-1 overall and St. Joseph's falls to 2-2. The Nittany Lions continue weekend road action at Delaware on Sunday Sept. 11 at 12 p.m.

Volunteers with the Ashrei Foundation will discuss how to get proper state identification documentation from government agencies for housing applications employment and particularly to vote in the upcoming election.

There are many barriers to accessing a photo ID card or a birth certificate because each document has its own process which can be complicated and time consuming said Sara Ruiz the foundation’s executive director.

“For someone who is working multiple jobs who can't take time off who maybe doesn't have money to pay the bus to get to where they need to go is going to make some really hard choices and sacrifices in order to get there so that they can exercise their constitutional right to vote” Ruiz said.

Once clinic volunteers go over with residents the process of how to retrieve a birth certificate or a state- issued non-driver ID card they will provide an informational packet that will include next steps. The foundation will cover the cost of the birth certificate or ID if residents are not eligible to receive a free state-issued ID. It also will provide transportation funds to help people to and from local state agencies or a Missouri motor vehicle location.

The foundation adopted the clinic model from St. Louis’ St. Francis Xavier College Church which began helping residents of low-income areas disabled and aging people and underserved communities get birth certificates or photo IDs nearly 30 years ago.

Ruiz said the photo ID clinic is especially important now that a new Missouri law requires people to have a state-issued photo ID to vote in any election. Student IDs voter registration cards an expired ID or a driver’s license from another state are no longer accepted at the polls.

Voting rights advocates say the new law will affect Missourians of color and low-income residents the most because they face the most challenges with voting.

“Many people lack access to a DMV office. Many are not open evenings or weekends which makes it very difficult for low wage workers or shift workers to get to a DMV office during the business hours when they're open” said Denise Lieberman director and general counsel of the Missouri Voters Protection Coalition.

She said communities of color senior citizens parents who lack child care and people with disabilities are least likely to have an identification card and will not go out of their way to retrieve one which also hinders them from voting.

“They need to get help in the communities where they live by community members they know and trust” Lieberman said. “That's why these regional clinics are so needed and so important to being able to talk to voters and help make sure that they understand what the rules are and that they have the assistance that they need to get those IDs.”

The foundation also is working with St. Francis Xavier College Church on Sept. 12 to virtually train volunteers on ways to help residents retrieve documents needed to vote and teach people how to develop and launch their own community photo ID clinic.

“I think when you look at a Missouri legislature that has enacted laws responding to problems that don't exist in order to silence voices that they don't want to hear then those are exactly the intersections of democracy and faith that in which we are called to stand” Ruiz said.

The north St. Louis photo ID clinic is open from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday at 3000 E. Prairie Ave. Walk-ins are welcomed."

Flatley Memorial Award for Naval Aviation Safety in Operations in Norfolk Virginia Aug. 22 in recognition of their 2021 deployment to the 5th and 6th fleet areas of operation.



Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Michael M. Gilday submitted the recognition for outstanding achievement in mishap prevention during operations. Rear Adm. Christopher M. Engdahl Commander Naval Safety Command presented the award to Iwo Jima‘s Commanding Officer Capt. Judd Krier and the ship’s Safety Officer Lt. Phillip Skelley.



“This distinctive accomplishment is the result of superior leadership and a proactive all-hands commitment to the principles of operational risk management” said Rear Adm. Fredrick R. Luchtman on the citation that accompanied the award. “This superlative performance is in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States naval service.”



Iwo Jima was recognized for exemplary safety practices as there were no major mishaps and the ship maintained a strong safety record during all operations in 2021.



“This is a team award because it recognizes the effort and operational effectiveness of Iwo Jima’s crew aviation units embarked and the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit as a whole” Skelley said. “The Flatley Memorial Award is given to units who uphold a consistent standard in all operations undertaken at sea.”



Throughout deployment USS Iwo Jima’s Air Department provided full service support to the embarked Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 26 (HSC-26) and 24th MEU aircraft during daily amphibious operations. USS Iwo Jima and embarked units safely and efficiently flew 4338.5 flight hours including 15 operational vertical replenishments (VERTREP). Additionally HSC-26 aircraft facilitated the safe and efficient off-load of 803 tons of conventional ordnance valued in excess of $201 million by VERTREP with USNS Medgar Evers (T-AKE-13) over a period of three days. In order to make these evolutions possible the crew conducted 4411 aircraft moves providing 2.1 million gallons of JP-5 fuel. The expertise of the Air Department ensured that USS Iwo Jima was fully ready to support daily 5th and 6th Fleet exercises and operations underway such as Ragnar Viking and Operation Allies Refuge.



USS Iwo Jima’s exceptional safety record and the professionalism and seamless integration of embarked Navy and Marine Corps units demonstrated that the USS Iwo Jima Amphibious Readiness Group was ready and willing to support the nation’s allies. The Aviation Training Team held high standards while conducting 31 flight deck and hangar bay aircraft fire drills. This training was invaluable to ensured quick and effective crash and fire response on the flight deck and in the hangar bay focusing on initial response procedures to include hose handling aqueous film forming foam station operation and background assistance.



Skelley said the safety culture fostered during the ship’s 2021 deployment provided a strong foundation for it to uphold during future operations. This foundation helped the ship safely accomplish the crew’s homeport shift from Mayport Florida to Norfolk Virginia Dec. 13 2021.



“Our practices are the enterprise standard and we lead by example” Skelley said. “I am extremely proud of the entire team because it’s not just a safety department award or aviation award it really is in recognition of the continued efforts of every Iwo Jima Sailor and Marine from the Captain all the way to the newest check-in” Skelley said.



This was Iwo Jima’s fourth time winning the Admiral H. Flatley Memorial Award for Naval Aviation Safety. Iwo Jima previously won the award in 2018 2015 and 2003.

We now have our formal review of this compact motherboard that packs a 16-core CPU which is a high-end solution in this space. It also has eight network ports including 1GbE 10GbE and 25GbE. Also new for this generation is PCIe Gen4. This is a high-end embedded platform and in our review we are going to see why and what the features are that differentiate it from the previous generations that we have reviewed.

Supermicro X12SDV-16C-SPT8F Overview

The motherboard is an interesting shape to say the least. It is listed as a mATX motherboard at 7.5″ x 8.5″ (191mm x 216mm.) This may seem strange since the standard mATX is 9.6″ x 9.6″ and mITX is 6.7″ x 6.7″.

This smaller form factor allows Supermicro to use standard mounting holes but also to fit in in shorter depth 1U chassis. Here is an example in a 1U chassis with this motherboard configured.

Here one can see that the shorter 7.5″ side is designed to allow a PCIe card on a riser in this system.

Perhaps the biggest feature of this motherboard is the CPU. Onboard we have an Intel Xeon D-2775TE 16 core / 32 thread processor.

The Xeon D-2775TE is part of the Intel Ice Lake D series. Welcome to the Intel Ice Lake D Era with the Xeon D-2700 and D-1700 series. We did a large piece on this a few months ago. Here is the accompanying video:

This CPU is flanked by four DIMM slots. These are DDR4-2933 slots and the chip itself is capable of four-channel memory. It also supports ECC RDIMMs and LRDIMMs that we expect will be used in most applications.

Along the top of the motherboard we get power connectors. Something that is surprising in this is the number of 4-pin PWM fan headers. Just in this photo there are four. Supermicro builds this motherboard for chassis with active airflow.

Something that is important for this generation is that the SATA ports are starting to become a smaller point of emphasis. We only get two 7-pin SATA ports one of them gold for powering SATADOMs. With M.2 SATADOMs have become less popular.

Given the Intel Ice Lake D being used is a 100W TDP part it means that the heatsink is larger than what we saw in the Supermicro X11SDV-16C-TP8F and Supermicro X10SDV-7TP8F generations. Although there is no fan on the motherboard this is not a fan-less design. It is designed to be used with chassis fans cooling the CPU and other components.

With this generation we get the ASPEED AST2600 BMC which is new in this generation.

Perhaps the biggest feature of this is the new PCIe Gen4 support. That is new for the Xeon D line in this generation. We get a PCIe Gen4 x16 slot along the bottom edge of this motherboard. There is also a M.2 PCIe Gen3 x4 slot.

While that is solid connectivity for a small platform we also get two SlimSAS 8-lane ports for more connectivity. We can see these being used for NVMe SSDs as an example.

There is also an Oculink 4-lane connector that provides PCIe Gen3 x4 or 4x SATA III lanes.

The rear IO is perhaps the star of this system. There is the out-of-band management port two USB 3 Type-A ports and a VGA port for standard connectivity. Then there are eight network ports.

On the leftmost side we have SFP28 cages for dual 25GbE connectivity. Next to those we have Intel X550-at2 powered 10Gbase-T ports. So one gets high-speed fiber/ DAC connectivity as well as 10GbE via standard RJ45.

The other four ports are powered by an Intel i350-am4. This is a higher-end 1GbE NIC and is basically the standard in 4x 1GbE connectivity today. Some boards will use 4x Intel i210 1GbE NICs but the i350 is a costlier solution with more features.

Overall this is a really unique platform from how much power it packs into a mATX-ish motherboard as well as how much connectivity is onboard. This is a large generational leap.

Next let us get to the topology management and performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,

TMUS,T-Mobile US,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhdGFjZW50ZXJkeW5hbWljcy5jb20vZW4vbmV3cy90LW1vYmlsZS1zZWxscy13aXJlbGluZS1idXNpbmVzcy10by1jb2dlbnQtZm9yLTEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,T-Mobile sells Wireline business to Cogent for $1,"The deal will see T-Mobile pay Cogent $700 million over the next four-and-a-half years for Cogent's IP transit services after which the deal closes with $350m due in equal payments during the first 12 months and the remaining $350m due in equal payments over the next 42 months.

T-Mobile has sold its Wireline business to Cogent Communications Holdings for a symbolic $1 with the operator set to take a $1 billion charge on the deal.

T-Mobile expects a pre-tax charge of $1bn from the sale of the wireline unit.

The sale of the wireline business means that T-Mobile is effectively offloading this legacy unit which comprises the legacy Sprint US long-haul fiber network. T-Mobile acquired the assets from Sprint as part of the $26bn merger which was completed two years ago.

Its wireline business generated $739 million in revenue last year and encompasses communications systems data processing equipment and fiber optic cable.

Cogent is one of the world's biggest Internet service providers and operates in over 50 markets worldwide with the company expecting to migrate customers from legacy systems to modern Ethernet VPLS or SD-WAN solutions.

The company will form a new directly established subsidiary on completion of the deal. As with all transactions this deal is subject to regulatory approval but Cogent expects it to close in the second half of 2023.

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC served as the exclusive financial advisor for Cogent with Latham & Watkins LLP acting as legal advisor while Houlihan Lokey served as the exclusive financial advisor to T-Mobile.

T-Mobile has upped its efforts to drive its 5G business in recent times with the operator comfortably serving the most cities in the US compared to rival operators with around 5000. Its 5G coverage covers 53 percent of the US notes WhistleOut.

The operator recently launched its 'ultra-capacity 5G' which relies on mid-band 2.5GHz spectrum at The Yankees Stadium New York and has collaborated with Elon Musk's SpaceX to provide mobile connectivity to remote areas from space via Starlink satellites.

However the telco has also cut down on its workforce reportedly cutting jobs within its network operations and engineering group. The company had 80000 employees at the close of its merger with Sprint but ended in 2021 with around 75000. Previous CEO John Legere said that the merger would provide more jobs back in 2018.

“Shedding the wireline business is an excellent move for T-Mobile” Mejeticks CEO Robert Devita told Channel Futures. “When you look at AT&T and Verizon their wireline business is definitely shrinking and holding down their stock prices. A pure-play wireless strategy is a strong move in the right direction for them.”

“T-Mobile never integrated the Sprint wireline network which is largely a legacy infrastructure that has not been significantly upgraded” added Courtney Munroe IDC research vice president of worldwide telecommunications. “This is a good outcome for both companies and the best alternative to shutting down the network which has been rumored for months.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRwb2xpY2UuY29tL2F0dC1zdWluZy10LW1vYmlsZS1vdmVyLXNlbmlvcnMtYWQtY2FtcGFpZ24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AT&T is pretty upset with T-Mobile over its recent ad campaign,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRwb2xpY2UuY29tL2F0dC1zdWluZy10LW1vYmlsZS1vdmVyLXNlbmlvcnMtYWQtY2FtcGFpZ24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMivAFodHRwczovL3RvcGNsYXNzYWN0aW9ucy5jb20vbGF3c3VpdC1zZXR0bGVtZW50cy9sYXdzdWl0LW5ld3MvYXR0LWNsYXNzLWFjdGlvbi1sYXdzdWl0LWFuZC1zZXR0bGVtZW50LW5ld3MvYXR0LWNsYXNzLWFjdGlvbi1jbGFpbXMtdC1tb2JpbGUtZmFsc2VseS1hZHZlcnRpc2VzLXRoYXQtYXR0LWJhbnMtc2VuaW9yLWRpc2NvdW50L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AT&T class action claims T-Mobile falsely advertises that AT&T bans senior discount,"Top Class Actions’s website and social media posts use affiliate links.

AT&T senior discount class action lawsuit overview:

Who: AT&T is suing T-Mobile for false advertising.

Why: AT&T says T-Mobile ran an advertising claim that said AT&T bans senior discounts when it says it does not.

Where: The lawsuit was filed in a Texas federal court.

T-Mobile ran an advertising campaign in which it lied to consumers telling them its rival AT&T did not offer discounts to seniors a new lawsuit alleges.

In a lawsuit filed by AT&T against T-Mobile USA Sept. 6 in a Texas federal court AT&T accuses T-Mobile of false advertising under the Lanham Act.

According to the lawsuit T-Mobile recently ran a new advertising campaign that was intentionally designed to deceive senior citizens.

In it T-Mobile claims that AT&T “bans senior discounts” the lawsuit states. T-Mobile allegedly states that Verizon Wireless and AT&T don’t give discounts to seniors outside of Florida. It says that means that 92% of seniors in the country “can’t get a wireless discount from Verizon or AT&T” the lawsuit states.

“Each one of these claims is literally false” AT&T says.

“AT&T does not ‘ban’ senior discounts in any way shape or form. To the contrary AT&T offers discounts to senior citizens on their wireless service. For example through AARP AT&T offers millions of seniors across every state discounts on monthly service charges and activation fees.”

T-Mobile’s campaign hurts AT&T and consumers lawsuit states

T-Mobile unveiled the campaign in August with a website: BannedSeniors.com.

On that website T-Mobile says the only ways for customers aged 55 or older to get a discounted wireless plan are to move to Florida obtain a Florida address or switch to T-Mobile AT&T says.

“Notwithstanding T-Mobile’s false statements otherwise AT&T offers discounts to senior citizens in all states” AT&T says. “They do not have to live in Florida. They do not have to move to Florida. And they do not have to switch to T-Mobile in order to obtain discounts.”

The “false and misleading” ad campaign has caused harm to AT&T and consumers the complaint states.

While competition is healthy for consumers lying is not the lawsuit states. The intent of T-Mobile’s campaign was to lie to consumers to get them to choose its services over AT&T it says. AT&T is seeking damages and an injunction.

The news comes as an AT&T customer last month objected to a proposed $14 million class action settlement agreed to by the company to resolve claims it charged its customers an improper fee.

Also last month the Federal Communications Commission asked the top U.S. mobile carriers to share details about their geolocation data privacy practices as it takes steps to ensure that customers’ sensitive data is protected.

What do you think of the allegations against T-Mobile in this class action lawsuit? Let us know your thoughts in the comments!

AT&T is represented by Pete Marketos and Tyler J. Bexley of Reese Marketos LLP.

The AT&T senior discount lawsuit is AT&T Mobility LLC v. T-Mobile USA Inc. Case No. 4:22-cv-00760 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.

This week Apple finally unveiled its long anticipated iPhone 14 and like every other year it includes camera updates and strengthened safety measures. However one tiny detail missing this year may pose a big problem for travelers that are avid iPhone customers: the new smartphone does not have Apple's signature SIM card tray.

When traveling American tourists generally prefer buying a local SIM as opposed to activating international roaming reason being fees for data usage abroad can be eye-watering. With previous iPhones buying a data package and inserting a new temporary SIM was an incredibly smooth process so long as a pin needle was at hand.

Now Apple has made SIM swapping slightly more complicated:

What's Wrong With Apple's New iPhone?

Image by Apple

During its Far Out event Apple finally presented to the public its new iPhone series comprising four new smartphone models: iPhone 14 iPhone 14 Plus and its flagship iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. In case you're interested in tech specs you can find more information about each model on the company's website but there's one thing that affects travelers directly:

The product has lost their physical SIM tray and buyers are expected to take out an eSIM data plan instead. While this shouldn't be an impediment within the U.S. with T&T Verizon and T-Mobile all offering the service accessing data in foreign countries where the technology isn't widely diffused may prove more difficult from now.

When traveling internationally especially remote or off path destinations it is extremely difficult to find kiosks selling digital data packages. Usually tourists are required to remove their own SIM and insert a secondary albeit temporary one. They're usually pre-paid as well meaning the sharing of personal information is minimal and there's little bureaucracy involved.

Once the standard iPhone 14 debuts the SIM-swapping process is due to change significantly. That is because some destinations may not have eSIM packages designed for tourists or even have eSIMs at all. This shouldn't be a problem in North America or Europe but this might become a thorn on the side of those heading to less developed nations:

eSIMs Are Not Widely Available In Some Major Destinations Yet

In Brazil for instance eSIMs are in theory sold by the country's three main data providers VIVO Claro and TIM though in reality finding stores where they're offered is challenging at the very least. In Brazil's case eSIMs are routinely available on a contract-basis only or staff may not even be familiar with the product let alone be able to assist visitors.

In other Latin American hotspots such as Argentina and Colombia pre-paid eSIMs can be purchased directly from internet providers such as Movistar though it is a well-known fact not all stores across these countries commercialize the product. Additionally countless nations across Asia and Africa are yet to launch them.

Based on Apple's official list of countries whose carriers support eSIM carrier activation traveling with an iPhone 14 shouldn't be a problem in:

Albania

Armenia

Argentina

Australia

Austria*

Bahamas

Bahrain

Belarus

Belgium

Brazil*

Bulgaria

Burkina Faso

Cambodia

Cameroon

Canada

Chile

Colombia

Croatia

Czech Republic

Denmark

Estonia

Slovenia

South Africa

South Korea

Spain

Sri Lanka

Sweden

Switzerland

Taiwan

Tajikistan

Thailand

Tunisia

Turkyie (Turkey)

Ukraine

United Arab Emirates

United Kingdom

United States

Vietnam

*Under EU roaming rules customers can use data freely within the entire European Zone which includes European Union countries Schengen Area members and other third partners such as Serbia and Montenegro though different rules may apply to pre-paid SIMs.

**It is worth noting that although certain countries are listed eSIMs may be difficult to find as is the case in Brazil.

Alternatively iPhone users can resort to ‘worldwide' eSIMs international data packages that are valid across the entire globe such as Airalo AirSIM GigSKY Flexiroam and others. Travelers are usually required to download an app choose their destination and product install the SIM and activate it upon landing.

We do not know at this point how well these global packages work or how fast and reliable they are compared to local providers.

Apple's Move Is Received With Mixed Reactions On Twitter

Naturally frequent travelers decried Apple's move with dozens taking to Twitter to express concern the transition period from ‘physical to digital' will be rough:

I'm sorry I can't get over this. So first it was the headphone jack Apple just made that a thing and it was a big pain for a bit. Now no SIM card so if you're traveling you're forced to pay for international roaming on your eSIM from US carriers?! #AppleEvent — Joshua Vergara (@jvtechtea) September 7 2022

No physical SIM anymore on iPhone 14 – only eSIM. This will hurt people like me who travel internationally and swap SIM cards. How does @Apple force such unilateral decisions on its customers no one asked for? I know no body would listen but I still would like to express. — Siddharth Manu सिद्धार्थ मनु سِدھّارتھ مَنوُ (@sidmanu) September 7 2022

Regarding this eSim thing in iPhone 14 seems like it would negatively impact my India travel routine where I buy SIM cards for cheap from street vendors to avoid the bureaucracy and days-long delays of going to a carrier store 🤔 — Grad Student Woodford 🇺🇦 (@chd) September 8 2022

What if you want to travel outside the USA with your eSim iPhone 14 to a country where it doesn’t work for example Ghana? #iPhone14 #eSIM — 𝓐𝓱𝓮𝓷𝓴𝓪𝓷 🌹🦋🥂❤️ (@ahen_kan) September 8 2022

As can be seen above travelers are worried they will not be able to activate eSIMs as easily as simply purchasing a local SIM from regular kiosks at their destination with one Twitter user drawing attention to the fact that in India the process of buying a data package from a carrier store can be ‘days long' and ‘bureaucratic'.

Two Ways You Can Still Have A Physical SIM Card While Upgrading Your iPhone

Apple's iPhone 14 may lack many deem an essential characteristic but it does allow up to eight eSIMs simultaneously. Even then if you're looking to upgrade your phone this year yet still avoid being restricted to eSIMs only you have two options:

Purchasing an iPhone 14 outside the U.S.  as it is the only country where Apple scrapped the trays*

 as it is the only country where Apple scrapped the trays* Opting instead for last year's iPhone 13 or 13 Pro range which features a SIM card tray giving customers more flexibility

*In an interview with PC Mag Avi Greengart Techsponential's lead analyst stated that the ‘rationale' for keeping the SIM slot in non-U.S. markets particularly Europe is the ‘sheer number of people using prepaid SIMs'. This may be due to the high volume of cross-border travel and facilitated international links within the continent.

It remains to be seen how well-tolerated these new iPhones will be in the context of international travel though we will surely find out soon.

One of those cutouts was said to be a hole punch while the other would be pill-shaped. As we all know by now Apple had a surprise in store: a new Dynamic Island cutout for the iPhone 14 Pro.

T-Mobile’s listings for the iPhone 14 Pro however show off the iPhone 14 that almost was.

The iPhone 14 Pro uses what Apple calls the Dynamic Island. The display panel itself still uses two separate cutouts but you wouldn’t know because Apple has taken that area of the screen and made it fully interactive. So the display panel itself still has those two separate cutouts but Apple has used software to make it essentially a dynamic status bar for your iPhone. It’s a really impressive design.

T-Mobile appears to be living in an alternate reality where the Dynamic Island doesn’t exist as spotted by Sam Kohl on Twitter. The carrier’s listings for the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max in space black and silver don’t show the Dynamic Notch. Instead they show the fully separated cutouts as the early rumors suggested.

This is actually pretty interesting. Outside of the missing Dynamic Island the images look like official renders straight from Apple using the iPhone 14 Pro wallpaper.

It seems like T-Mobile had been following the iPhone 14 Pro rumors and had some placeholder images. Once the iPhone 14 Pro was officially announced it slapped on the official Apple wallpaper and forgot to fix the rest of the render for two of the colors for the device.

It’s also worth remembering that Apple does not acknowledge the fact that the pill and hole punch cutouts are actually separated. All of the company’s marketing images show the two connected via the Dynamic Island.

T-Mobile hasn’t yet corrected these images but we’re guessing it won’t take long once they realize it. What do you think of this alternate reality imagined by T-Mobile? Let us know down in the comments.

City officials announced in a news release Thursday they had signed an agreement with the development group Annapolis Mobility and Resilience Partners or AMRP with backing from the Maryland Economic Development Corp. to pay for what is expected to be the largest municipal project in city history with an estimated cost of $70 million.

The transaction was completed about four months after the demolition of the downtown garage began and nearly two years after the city announced plans to enter into a private-public partnership to build a new garage and later redevelop the downtown waterfront area.

Demolition continues on the Hillman Garage in Annapolis June 1 2022.

Under the agreement the financing for the $28.3 million Hillman garage and much of the City Dock project — estimated at $41.62 million — will be partially paid through the issuance of bonds. The bond sale was completed Thursday when $47.3 million in Series A tax-exempt bonds were sold to investment groups T. Rowe Price Nuveen Franklin Funds MacKay Shields and JP Morgan Investment for their Maryland investment fund portfolios according to the city release.

Maryland Economic Development Corp. or MEDCO handled the bond sale and will will collect parking and other revenues and make payments on the debt and other expenses like garage operations maintenance and construction contracts the city said. Any remaining funds will be paid to the city which Public Works Director David Jarrell estimated will be about $1 million per year.

MEDCO was established in 1984 by the Maryland General Assembly to help finance local projects that retain existing businesses in the state and attract new ones. One of the ways it does this is by borrowing money and issuing bonds.

The bonds will be paid back over 30 years from the parking revenue generated by the garage and surrounding on-street parking. The city will now receive a one-time payment of $25.35 million as part of the deal said Jarrell who recently returned to the job after two years as city manager.

That money known as a concession payment will be used to pay down more than half of the City Dock redevelopment.

In 2020 the city tapped AMRP a group of 10 companies — some with Annapolis and Baltimore ties — to undertake the multiphase project. Since late February AMRP has been working to secure financing. Meanwhile Baltimore-based Whiting-Turner Contracting Co. began overseeing the demolition of the nearly 50-year-old Hillman garage in May. The new parking structure is slated to have 165 more parking spaces modern amenities like EV charging stations and solar panels and take 14 to 16 months to build.

Construction of the replacement garage is on schedule and slated to open in June 2023 the city announced.

The city plans to use the $25.3 million concession payment to seed the City Dock project slated to get underway in late 2023. Additional bond offerings and state and federal grants will pay the remaining costs. Some of that money is already accounted for thanks to a $10 million commitment from the state of Maryland $3.2 million in American Rescue Plan funding and just over $1 million in federal funding.

Cost estimates for that phase have risen from $35 million to about $42 million in recent months because of construction cost inflation and increased material and equipment costs and labor shortages Jarrell said.

The scope of the project which includes a raised park on the current site of the Dock Street parking lot flood barriers and stormwater pumps to combat rising sea levels has not changed he said. Completion of the project is expected in 2025.

The Annapolis City Council endorsed the private-public partnership in February after briefly debating whether the city should issue its own general obligation bonds a move some council members thought might be better for the city in the long run and avoid giving up control of the garage for decades.

In that scenario the city would have retained full control of the new garage and with it the millions of dollars in parking revenue it generates annually. However by issuing bonds to pay for the project the city would have also taken on approximately $65 million in debt according to estimates from Coldwell Banker Richard Ellis a commercial real estate and investment firm hired to advise the city on the Hillman deal. Because MEDCO issued the bonds the city does not have liability for them Jarrell said.

“A lot of work went into this complex agreement and I’d like to acknowledge their expertise and patience” Mayor Gavin Buckley said in a news release. “I can see the garage rebuild from my office and I know that downtown businesses and residents will be thrilled when we get to the other side of the construction. It’s going to be amazing for parking for our environment and for convenience. Each day we move a little closer to our goals.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV5ZW9uYW5uYXBvbGlzLm5ldC8yMDIyLzA5L2FubmFwb2xpcy1zaWducy1jb250cmFjdC1mb3ItZ2FyYWdlLWNpdHktZG9jay13b3JrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Annapolis Signs Contract for Garage/City Dock Work,"The City of Annapolis has signed an agreement with AMRP to demolish and reconstruct the Hillman parking garage and modify the City Dock. Since May they have been operating under a “Pre-Development Agreement” since construction began in May.

The City’s announcement follows:

The City of Annapolis has achieved a major milestone toward the completion of two historic downtown infrastructure projects. The City and Annapolis Mobility and Resilience Partners (AMRP) have successfully completed financial close to fund both the rebuild of Hillman Garage and the revitalization and resilience improvements for Annapolis City Dock. Maryland Economic Development Corporation (MEDCO) is the concessionaire handling the sale of bonds collecting the parking and other revenue and making payments on the debt financing construction contracts garage operations and maintenance and other expenses.

Series A tax-exempt bonds were issued on September 8 underwritten by Morgan Stanley. The bonds were sold to investment groups for their Maryland investment fund portfolios including investment houses T. Rowe Price Nuveen Franklin Funds MacKay Shields and JP Morgan Investment.

Construction on the replacement of the Noah Hillman Garage began in May and continues on schedule with opening slated for June 2023. The new garage will feature 165 more parking spaces stormwater and other environmental improvements better ingress/egress EV charging stations and working elevators. A ‘Reimagined City Dock’ will involve raising the sea walls and installing hydraulic flip-up storm surge gates to protect downtown residents and businesses from floodwaters and storm surge. A new terraced green park will provide stormwater infiltration and offer an additional defense against rising seas. It will also provide great views and an expanded and programmable public space. The City Dock construction will take approximately 18 months and will begin in Fall 2023.

“I want to thank our City team including Finance Director Jodee Dickinson former City Manager David Jarrell and our consultant Eileen Fogarty for getting this across the finish line” said Mayor Gavin Buckley. “A lot of work went into this complex agreement and I’d like to acknowledge their expertise and patience. I can see the garage rebuild from my office and I know that downtown businesses and residents will be thrilled when we get to the other side of the construction. It’s going to be amazing for parking for our environment and for convenience. Each day we move a little closer to our goals.”

The City and AMRP have been working under a Pre-Development Agreement (PDA) since December of 2020. The member firms in the AMRP team include: Amber Infrastructure a subsidiary of the Hunt Companies (developer); Whiting Turner (design-builder); BCT Architects (master planner); Walker Consultants (lead designer Hillman Garage); WSP (lead designer City Dock); Mahan Rykiel (landscape architect); Premium Parking (parking operator); and VIA (alternative mobility provider).

BACKGROUND

In February 2019 Mayor Gavin Buckley selected nearly 100 resident and business stakeholders for appointment to the City Dock Action Committee (CDAC) in addition to partners from the National Park Service USNA Anne Arundel County and Historic Annapolis. CDAC used the Urban Land Institute’s (ULI) “Reclaiming a Local and National Treasure” as a foundational document from the ULI Technical Advisory Panel convened in 2018 by Historic Annapolis Preservation Maryland and the National Trust for Historic Preservation.

The CDAC was tasked with creating a plan to reimagine a resilient future for Annapolis’ City Dock. The CDAC was assembled into nine teams to develop ideas recommendations and a conceptual design incorporating financing parking maritime uses resiliency business and community benefits/character. In January 2020 this group of committed Annapolitans reached a unanimous consensus for a dynamic vision for Annapolis’ waterfront with a world-class park a continuous promenade connecting the United States Naval Academy to City Dock and a strategic approach to protect downtown from future flooding.

To make this plan a reality the City advertised a Request for Qualifications to conduct the design/build work which included a Public-Private Partnership (P3) financing mechanism. One goal of the P3 was to fund the majority of the project through private financing rather than asking City taxpayers to carry that cost. AMRP was selected from five teams to handle the design build financing and operational components of the project.

Under the plan signed today by the City AMRP and MEDCO the financing of Hillman Garage ($28.3 million) and a significant portion of City Dock ($41.62 million) will rely on a series of bond issues that will be paid back over 30 years from parking revenue generated by the new garage and on-street parking managed by Premium Parking. The total issuance of the Series A bonds is $47.3 million. Additional funding for City Dock will be provided by private bond offerings a concession payment and grants from state and federal government infrastructure funds. The State of Maryland has already committed $10 million while $3.2 million was awarded to the City from American Rescue Plan Act funds. An additional $1.125 million has been committed from Congressional Direct Spending. Additional grant funding is being sought as the City Dock project design gets underway including a $4.5 million request to elevate and restore the historic Burtis House.

“This is a great opportunity for our historic City” said City Manager Michael Mallinoff. “When the work on the garage and City Dock is completed in 2025 it will not only help downtown avoid the destruction caused by flooding events it will also be a model for pairing infrastructure work with resiliency efforts. This is part of our ongoing infrastructure investments that have long-term benefits for our entire community. We are doing this for the longevity of our historic City and I could not be more pleased that so many people have come to the table to make this community-driven vision a reality.”",,,

Though it’s only been a public item for a year the Marvel-themed tactical game has gone through it. First announced during last year’s Gamescom Geoffstravaganza Midnight Suns was initially given a March 2022 release window (albeit without a specific date). By November 2021 just three months after its initial unveiling the game had already been delayed to the back half of 2022. In June during not-E3 2022 2K gave it an October release date. Then it was delayed again this past August and given a new window that coincided with 2K Games parent company Take-Two Interactive’s fiscal year—meaning sometime on or before March 31 2023.

That window however only applies for the Xbox Series X/S and PC versions; the last-gen console versions aren’t due until way down the line. There’s still no word on when those are expected.

Still despite the turbulence Midnight Suns has looked excellent at every turn. Developed by Firaxis Midnight Suns clearly follows in the grid-based footsteps of the studio’s extraterrestrial-themed tactical games XCOM and XCOM 2. Rather than a bunch of earthbound space marines you control a cast of Marvel heroes including Doctor Strange Wolverine Iron Man Captain America Blade and Spider-Man. You also get to create your own hero customizing their design and abilities.

The most interesting wrinkle however is its card-based mechanic. Rather than employing a standard moveset you start each turn with a randomized hand of cards. Some might determine your movement options. Others might dictate what attacks or defensive moves you can make. Though it’s not exactly the XCOM clone some Firaxis fans are hungry for the mechanic should shake up a longstanding formula. But XCOM diehards might yet bristle at one facet: Midnight Suns won’t have permadeath. Push the envelope all you want we can’t have those heroes dying on screen!

Ahead of its investor day the New York-based company behind luxury brands Coach Stuart Weitzman and Kate Spade said it expects annual revenues to reach $8 billion by its fiscal-year 2025 reflecting a three-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6% to 7%.

""We are a different company today than we were two years ago"" Tapestry CEO Joanne Crevoiserat said in a phone call with Yahoo Finance. ""We've gone through an incredible and a very successful transformation with our acceleration program and we've created in really harnessing very unique and distinctive competitive advantages across our platform.""

In its new three-year roadmap the company set targets for each of its three brands.

At Coach the company expects revenue to grow to $5.7 billion while maintaining an operating margin of 30%. At Kate Spade revenue growth is expected to be in the high-single-digits in order to hit $1.9 billion while expanding operating margin to the mid-teens. At Stuart Weitzman revenue growth is expected to see a low-double digit growth rate to $450 million while expanding operating margin to high single-digits.

On Friday Stuart Weitzman also announced Kim Kardashian as a new brand ambassador. Previously the company teamed up with Kendall Jenner.

In addition Tapestry anticipates it will deliver earnings per share of more than $5 in fiscal year 2025 and plans to return $3 billion in capital to shareholders via stock repurchases and dividends.

Shares of Tapestry were up about 1.5% in pre-market trading on Friday.

Crevoiserat who became CEO of Tapestry in 2020 was confident in the direction of the fashion retail company two years into her role. After sales slumped earlier that year the company embarked on an ambitious program to cut costs jumpstart global growth and lean into e-commerce.

""We made a lot of changes across our organization over the last couple of years"" Crevoiserat said. ""We weren't playing defense. Actually we were playing offense and setting our organization to be able to be more agile because the trends that we're seeing and some of the disruption and the changes those are trends I think that are going to be with us for a long time.""

'The consumer is moving fast'

Crevoiserat noted that unlike other retailers Tapestry is not experiencing a slowdown in consumer spending amid broader macroeconomic concerns. According to Crevoiserat the luxury fashion house learned from curve balls during the pandemic such as supply chain issues in Vietnam and China due to COVID-19 related restrictions.

Story continues

In the most recent quarter Tapestry achieved a record $6.7 billion dollars in revenue for fiscal year 2022 up over 15% year over year and 11% higher than pre-pandemic levels. Digital sales alone accounted for $2 billion dollars accounting for 30% of total revenue and tripling pre-pandemic online sales.

""This omni-channel experience is going to help power growth and we have a robust business around the world — we're going to power growth across geographies as well"" Crevoiserat said.

The company currently has a 90% direct-to-consumer model a factor that differentiates it from its competitors and provides a ""source"" for continued engagement with consumers and pricing power across its brands Crevoiserat stated.

""We see how she shops where she shops what she buys and we learn a lot from those engagements"" she said. ""Those insights then power our creativity so we're able to deliver better products and experiences based on those that knowledge and insight. That also allows us to deepen the relationship with our customers as we see them buying a handbag we can also target a broader lifestyle category and bring her back and one in footwear or jewelry.""

Going forward the new growth strategy called 'Future Speed' rests on four pillars: Building lasting customer relationships fueling fashion innovation and product excellence delivering compelling omnichannel experiences and powering global growth.

""We've proven to have the ability and the agility to move with the customers"" Crevoiserat said. ""The consumer is moving fast and we've engineered our organization to be able to respond to those changes and be closer to that consumer.""

The New York-based owner of the Coach Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman brands is holding an investor day on Friday morning before the opening of the stock market where it will lay out its targets for the next three years. At the event the brand will also announce that Kardashian will become global ambassador of the Stuart Weitzman label.

Joanne Crevoiserat chief executive officer of Tapestry Inc. told WWD that Kardashian has been a longtime fan of the brand and “will help drive awareness with our target customer base.”

But while the Kardashian news may get the most buzz it’s the numbers that have the management team at Tapestry the most energized.

In addition to its revenue goal Tapestry is also projecting operating margin in the neighborhood of 19 percent which would represent an expansion of approximately 100 basis points from fiscal year 2022.

The company is also calling for:

Earnings per diluted share of more than $5 for a low-to-mid teens three-year compounded annual growth rate

A cumulative cash return of $3 billion to shareholders by fiscal 2025

A targeted dividend payout ratio of 35 percent to 40 percent

Share repurchases of at least $700 million annually

These targets incorporate the company’s previously announced fiscal 2023 outlook.

By brand Coach is expected to hit sales of $5.7 billion with an operating margin of 30 percent and a mid-single-digit three year compounded annual growth rate. Crevoiserat said the company’s flagship brand has been performing well as it continues to evolve zeroing in on what the company refers to as “expressive luxury.”

Crevoiserat said luxury today is defined less by price and more by the opportunity to allow consumers to express themselves and showcase comfort in what they’re wearing the CEO contended.

“We’re also broadening the aperture at Coach by acquiring more Gen Z consumers” she said a strategy that will continue.

For Kate Spade she said the brand has been successful in “harnessing the power” of its name and embracing its “true DNA” while leaning into more lifestyle product and exploring global opportunities. Overall the projection is for sales of $1.9 billion with high-single-digit growth and operating margins in the mid-teens she said.

And at Stuart Weitzman the plan is to grow in the low double digits over the three-year period to $450 million while increasing operating margin to the high-single digits.

“We’re building momentum behind the brand and amping up the heat” Crevoiserat said. That will include focus on product omnichannel opportunities and beefing up its marketing muscle by working with Kardashian.

“We’ve got a lot of growth ahead of us” she said adding that even during the pandemic the company has been preparing its strategy for future growth and now it is ready to begin “playing offense.”

“Over the last two years we radically transformed our company with a sharpened focus on the consumer and commitment to brand building — delivering standout results” Crevoiserat said. “From this strong foundation we have tremendous runway and are poised to drive continued growth across each of our iconic brands. The environment is ever-changing and we are ready to move at the speed of the consumer with agility and intention. Importantly we are confident in our ability to fuel sustainable top- and bottom-line gains and generate significant cash flow creating meaningful value for all our stakeholders in the years to come.”

The company also said it expects gradual recovery in Greater China from COVID-19-related disruptions with no further significant lockdowns or incremental supply chain pressures. It also sees no material worsening of inflationary pressures or further downturns in consumer confidence.

Crevoiserat said the corporation is in the midst of an “important transformation” designed to “harness our competitive advantage. We’re calling this new phase: Future Speed. Our mantra is to power our brands at the speed of the consumer and getting the company wired to move with agility and meet the customers where they are.”

Scott Roe chief financial officer and chief operating officer said “We have powerful brands that participate in attractive and durable categories with a business model that is both proven and profitable. We will remain balanced in our approach to fueling revenue gains operating margin expansion and earnings increases. At the same time we will continue to be disciplined allocators of capital with a plan to return $3 billion to shareholders through fiscal year ‘25 supported by our strong free cash flow. Together we believe this will drive significant total shareholder returns over our planning horizon.”

Asked if Tapestry would consider adding another brand to its portfolio Crevoiserat said she believes there is a lot of “runway in our current portfolio” and the current focus is on “building a scalable platform” for the existing labels.

Instead of losing focus through acquisitions Crevoiserat said the plan is to amplify and extend the competitive advantages of its three brands by building lasting customer relationships; focusing on fashion innovation and product excellent in core handbags and leather goods while accelerating gains in footwear and lifestyle products delivering a compelling omni-channel experience and growing globally with a priority on North America and China its largest markets while exploring opportunities in under-penetrated regions such as Southeast Asia and Europe.

In August Tapestry reported full-year results for fiscal 2022 with sales of $6.7 billion an increase of 16 percent over the prior year’s $5.75 billion and 11 percent above 2019. Digital sales in the year hit $2 billion more than triple fiscal year 2019 and now represent 30 percent of the company’s total revenue. Net income was $856 million up from $834 million a year ago. The company’s projection for fiscal 2023 are sales of $6.9 billion and an increase of 3 percent to 4 percent with earnings per share of $3.80 to $3.90 which would represent double-digit growth compared to the prior year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9jb2FjaC1jaGFzZXMtZ2VuLXotYXMtdGFwZXN0cnktc2Vla3MtZG9sbGFyOC1iaWxsaW9uLXJldmVudWXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coach chases Gen Z as Tapestry seeks $8 billion revenue,"Coach has a revenue target of $5.7 billion by 2025 representing mid-single-digit growth compared to its current position. In its last full-year financial report Tapestry said Coach had seen gains after select price increases and its move away from discounting: net sales hit $4.9 billion in 2022 up 16 per cent year-on-year and 15 per cent versus pre-pandemic. Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman are slated to achieve $1.9 billion and $450 million in revenue respectively in the same period. The targets are conditional on the value of the US dollar remaining consistent a continued gradual recovery from Covid-related disruption in Greater China and no material worsening of inflationary pressures or consumer confidence.

Tapestry CEO Joanne Crevoiserat tells Vogue Business that “the ability to evolve the concept of luxury” and “keep pace with the rapidly changing landscape and consumer preferences” are crucial to the long-term survival of brands.

Leaning into expressive luxury

Coach which was founded in 1941 has already pivoted several times. It adopted the term “accessible luxury” in the early 2000s as an evolving middle class sought a compromise between price and quality. “That tapped into a white space in the market” explains Joon Silverstein SVP global and North America marketing and sustainability at Coach. “Over time accessibility became more about price than it did about luxury.”

The term “expressive luxury” might not mean much to consumers but it was devised from focus groups and consumer surveys to reflect broader changes in what they want from brands. “It is a shift from brand expression to self-expression exclusivity to inclusivity; from status and ownership to emotions and values” explains Silverstein.

In more tangible terms this means the brand is exploring circular business models. Consumers care more about participation than ownership now she continues; they want to regularly switch up their self-expression instead of investing in one item worn the same way for life. “We’re seeing consumers make trade-offs that prioritise affordability and trend over sustainability and increasingly recognise the dissonance of those choices” says Silverstein.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vZm9vdHdlYXJuZXdzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9yZXRhaWwvdGFwZXN0cnktdW52ZWlscy10aHJlZS15ZWFyLWdyb3d0aC1wbGFuLTEyMDMzMzQ0NDgv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly9mb290d2Vhcm5ld3MuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3JldGFpbC90YXBlc3RyeS11bnZlaWxzLXRocmVlLXllYXItZ3Jvd3RoLXBsYW4tMTIwMzMzNDQ0OC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tapestry Outlines Goal to Reach $8 Billion in Revenue by Fiscal Year 2025,"Tapestry is looking ahead to 2025.

The New York-based company which owns Coach Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman announced a new three-year growth strategy at its 2022 Investor Day on Friday. According to the company the new plan is aimed at driving sustainable profitable growth and significant cash return to shareholders while building on the success of its Acceleration Program.

“Over the last two years we radically transformed our company with a sharpened focus on the consumer and commitment to brand building delivering standout results” Joanne Crevoiserat CEO of Tapestry said in a statement. “From this strong foundation we have tremendous runway and are poised to drive continued growth across each of our iconic brands.”

Crevoiserat added that given the ever-changing environment Tapestry is ready to “move at the speed of the consumer” with agility and intention. “We are confident in our ability to fuel sustainable top and bottom-line gains and generate significant cash flow creating meaningful value for all our stakeholders in the years to come” the CEO added.

Among the new goals includes new financial targets for the years ahead. The company now expects to achieve revenue of $8 billion by fiscal year 2025 reflecting a three-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6% to 7%.

Of this growth Coach is expected to see revenue growth at a mid-single-digit three-year CAGR to $5.7 billion while maintaining an operating margin of 30%. At Kate Spade revenue growth is expected at a high-single digit three-year CAGR to $1.9 billion while expanding operating margin to mid-teens. The brand remains on track to achieve $2 billion in revenue and high-teens operating margin the company said. And at Stuart Weitzman revenue growth is expected at a low-double digit three-year CAGR to $450 million while expanding operating margin to high-single-digits.

Scott Roe CFO and COO of Tapestry added in a statement that the company has “powerful brands that participate in attractive and durable categories” with a business model that is both “proven and profitable.”

Roe also mentioned that Tapestry has a plan to return $3 billion to shareholders through fiscal year 2025 supported by its strong free cash flow. “Together we believe this will drive significant total shareholder returns over our planning horizon” Roe added.

These targets incorporate the company’s previously announced fiscal 2023 outlook which was provided with its fourth quarter earnings results in mid-August.

Tapestry Inc. ended the fiscal year last month with record revenues fueled by gains across its portfolio with each brand delivering double-digit sales increases.

The New York-based company reported last month that its net sales for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022 were $1.62 billion an increase of 1% over last year. Compared to pre-pandemic 2019 Tapestry grew 7%. Net income for Q4 was $189 million on a reported basis with earnings per diluted share of 75 cents — down from $200 million and earnings per diluted share of 69 cents in the prior year period.

As for full-year 2022 Tapestry saw net sales of $6.68 billion an increase of 16% from last year’s $5.75 billion total. Net income for the full year was $856 million on a reported basis with earnings per diluted share of $3.17. This compared to net income of $834 million and earnings per diluted share of $2.95 in the prior year.

Looking ahead Tapestry expects revenue in the area of $6.9 billion for fiscal 2023. This represents an increase of 3% to 4% on a reported basis.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvY29hY2gtYmFncy1wb3B1bGFyLWlzLWNvYWNoLWJhY2sv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coach CEO: Accessible Luxury 'Put Us in a Box That We Don't Live in Anymore',"Fashion has come to know many Coaches.

The New York-based leather goods brand has been the shoulder bag for the masses the wristlet to every American tween the high-fashion hopeful the soaring demand and slinking sentiment. But for its next act Coach will play fashion’s Dr. Frankenstein and kill the monster it created: accessible luxury fashion’s midland between ultra cheap and luxury.

“This idea of accessible luxury or trying to redefine access to luxury did us a disservice” chief executive Todd Kahn told BoF exclusively. “It put us in a box that we don’t live in anymore.”

At Coach’s investor day Friday the brand is coining a new term “expressive luxury” as part of a broader repositioning meant to lure Gen-Z and lean away from the down market connotations of “accessible” and more into “luxury.”

The repositioning builds on the turnaround Coach began a decade ago after falling into a discounting dash with accessible luxury joiners like Michael Kors. To change its luck back then the label tasked ex-Loewe ex-Louis Vuitton import Stuart Vevers with making the case for Coach as a lifestyle brand with a high-fashion temperament. He launched ready-to-wear and concepts like Rexy the dinosaur but nothing seemed to stick. Sales stayed stagnant and executives went through a revolving door.

Coach started to see some momentum internationally in 2019 but North American sales continued to deteriorate. The pandemic erased any progress and then some. By mid 2020 when Todd Kahn — a 14-year veteran of the brand — was appointed interim CEO of the brand shares in Tapestry Coach’s parent company were trading at their lowest point since the 2009 financial crisis. Coach itself was in need of a lifeline.

“I felt a little bit like Winston Churchill on the eve of World War II” said Kahn.

It seems Coach’s efforts are starting to pay off. In its most recent fiscal year the brand’s overall sales recovered to above pre-pandemic levels up 16 percent year-over-year to $4.9 billion. It managed to raise the average price of its handbags by 30 percent compared to 2019. A BoF Insights report found Coach was the first brand most US shoppers thought of when considering buying a bag and it ranked in the top 10 among high-net-worth individuals in the US and China. Coach recruited nearly 8 million new customers in North America in the last two years.

Coach was one of the first among mid-luxury American brands to acknowledge it had been devalued with Michael Kors and Ralph Lauren now targeting the same sort of brand elevation said BMO Capital Markets managing director and senior analyst Simeon Siegal. They are all racing to cement their high-end status which will help them weather a recession that is likely to hit lower-income customers harder than wealthy ones.

“The hardest question in fashion is figuring out the right balance between exclusivity and distribution” said Siegel. “It’s figuring out how to sell a lot without losing the ability to command price.”

Power Restored

Starting in the early 2010s Coach set out to claw back pricing power. It cut costs reduced inventory and pulled back on department stores building a fleet of outlets where it could push out cheaper bags for a mass consumer without relying on extreme discounting. Sales inched up incrementally but unremarkably.

During the pandemic Coach debuted a plan to beef up data and digital. It established an e-commerce arm boosting online sales from 8 percent of total revenue in 2020 to about 30 percent now said Kahn. It started to look at its customer clearly rather than aspirationally. Kahn acknowledged as much on an earnings call in 2020: “At certain times we have placed too much focus on the customer we wanted and not on who our customer actually is.”

The target customer shops across channels purchasing a $200 bag one day then an $800 bag the next Kahn said. Rather than offering full-price items on Fifth Avenue and discounts hidden in the suburbs they commingle online — to a point. Customers could buy basic products on coachoutlet.com for under $500 and embellished limited edition versions on Coach.com for more.

Coach also started to get release cadence and product right. Noticing the popularity of its Tabby bag in 2019 it put out a puffy update in 2021 rather than phasing it to outlets and focusing on a new shape. Coach has since updated the Tabby with a soft version and different colourways at a range of price points — from $195 up to $4500.

It’s done the same with other popular bags. This month the brand put out a graffiti-covered Rogue as part of a collaboration with artists Mint + Serf. Last month it turned the silhouette to a cartoon with leather eyes and shearling eyebrows to make “Coachies.”

“It’s actually a much stronger formula for success than constantly bringing newness and prematurely killing off fabulous bags” said Kahn.

Call It a Comeback?

In a statement ahead of its investor call Tapestry said it expects Coach revenue to grow to $5.7 billion by 2025.

The brand has had some help from its rivals in finding a bigger audience for its full price merchandise. According to Jefferies luxury brands increased prices by 10.7 percent on average in 2021 and have already bumped prices 10.3 percent this year. The price of certain Chanel bags has doubled since 2019. Coach’s bags still mostly under $1000 appeal to priced-out entry-level luxury consumers.

“The white space between us and them has grown more than at any time in our history” said Kahn.

The rise of resale could make things more difficult said Michael Binetti managing director and senior equity analyst at Credit Suisse. What’s stopping a consumer from buying a secondhand Gucci bag for $1000 rather than a new Coach bag for the same price?

Where Coach has gone for a more streamlined approach to merchandising it’s adopted the opposite strategy when it comes to ambassadors — an attempt to get people to think of Coach as more than a price tag and create a virtuous halo around product. Since tapping Selena Gomez in 2016 Coach now counts over 40 global influencers musicians actors and other celebrities on its roster.

They are often photographed by the fashion-forward Juergen Teller or appear in goofy campaigns like Coach’s Season 2 where Megan Thee Stallion Jennifer Lopez and K-Pop’s Dawn channelled nostalgia in TV ads and pop-culture moments alongside more niche names like Tavi Gevinson and Hari Nef.

A wide array of ambassadors is key to widening Coach’s audience said Kahn. The brand will tap fresh spokespeople but its marketing will focus more on telling stories and pushing Coach as the key to expressing personal style.

“Much like in 2000 when Coach coined the term accessible luxury and entered a golden age this is the next golden age for Coach with expressive luxury” said Kahn.

Expanding the Footprint

To keep growing Coach will have to figure out a way to sell more products to more customers while retaining control of brand perception said Siegel.

The brand has caught up in terms of digital with a growing e-commerce platform and fun influencer-thronged social media presence — even finding success on TikTok helped by the 7500 influencers with over 10000 followers that have posted about Coach at least once this year according to data firm Tribe Dynamics. Key creators like Alyssa McKay promoted the label’s outlet offering: #CoachOutlet generated almost $4.9 million in earned media value said Tribe Dynamics.

Elsewhere Coach continues to bolster its image with celebrities recently unveiling custom looks for Lil Nas X and campaigns with the Haim sisters Megan Thee Stallion and Japanese actor Dean Fujioka. Whether it has managed to convince shoppers it’s worth a rising regular price remains up in the air.

Added to that the world is in the midst of a Covid hangover said Siegel. Doing business in China which is a significant driver for Coach is getting even more difficult. During the pandemic demand for handbags shot up but hasn’t yet regulated said Siegel. That could make it difficult for Coach to get supply right and avoid falling into the death toll of discounting.

“I don’t know that we know what the new normal is yet … the question is going to be who can maintain their brand elevation at the price points” said Siegel.

Coach thinks by re-writing the accessibility narrative that plagued it and shifting to fit what it sees as Gen-Z’s evolving conception of luxury it can create staying power. A promising sign: Coach overtook both Michael Kors and Louis Vuitton as teens’ favourite handbag brand in Piper Sandler’s Spring 2022 survey.

“We excavated our purpose — and I use the word excavate very intentionally because it was always there” said Kahn."

In both cases it’s all about being able to accurately measure and report on emissions to understand where you (and they) are starting. From there you’ll look at opportunities to reduce those emissions together.



As a supplier where do you even begin? Consider the example of a company that makes things. Your customers want verified carbon footprint data for each of your products. For some businesses that could mean hundreds or thousands of stock-keeping units (SKUs). Leading companies that we’ve worked with tackle this challenge by first doing a high-level analysis of their products enabling them to home in on those with the biggest top-line impact or the biggest emissions. They then prioritize those products with the biggest potential—for revenue for emissions reductions or both.



As you build capabilities around data collection and reporting a key focus will be on creating a data model so that you can assess how changes in materials suppliers or locations affect a product’s emissions. This can be challenging and there are some common pitfalls to avoid with data modeling and extrapolation. In some cases you might look to create a lower-carbon or green version of a product while also continuing to produce the higher-emissions original. While the green version might not always command a price premium it could set your company apart from competitors and help you increase market share as customers increasingly look for green products and meet commitments.



What science-based targets mean for Scope 3



When it comes to GHG emissions reductions science-based targets are an important concept. As part of the SBTi’s Net Zero Standard framework companies commit to halving emissions by 2030 and getting close to zero emissions by 2050. To get there they are required to set both near-term and long-term targets. Both may require a significant effort on Scope 3 reductions. Here’s what each covers:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vZm9vdHdlYXJuZXdzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2tpbS1rYXJkYXNoaWFuLXN0dWFydC13ZWl0em1hbi1icmFuZC1mYWNlLTEyMDMzMzQ2NDgv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly9mb290d2Vhcm5ld3MuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2J1c2luZXNzLW5ld3Mva2ltLWthcmRhc2hpYW4tc3R1YXJ0LXdlaXR6bWFuLWJyYW5kLWZhY2UtMTIwMzMzNDY0OC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kim Kardashian Is the New Face of Stuart Weitzman,"Stuart Weitzman has tapped Kim Kardashian to be its new face.

Tesla brand loyalty (the propensity of return-to-market Tesla households to acquire another Tesla) has climbed to 67.5% in the first half of 2022 more than 12 percentage points higher than its brand loyalty in any preceding year (its next highest result was 55.2% in 2020). Driving these results is the Model 3 with a first half 2022 brand loyalty rate of 70.7% - higher than any other model on the U.S. market. In two of the first six months of 2022 Tesla's brand loyalty exceeded 70% (March - 73.1% and June - 72.8%). How does this compare to its luxury rivals? Tesla's June loyalty of 67.5% was almost 17 percentage points ahead of luxury runner-up Mercedes-Benz at 50.7%.

Tesla's market share results in the first half of 2022 are equally strong. With 20.5% share of the luxury market Tesla share is more than 6 percentage points above that of runner-up BMW. Tesla's June 2022 new registration volume of just over 50000 units represents the first time in (at least) the last 10 years that a luxury brand has registered more than 50000 new vehicles in one month. In fact the 40000 threshold per month has only been surpassed four times in 10 years - three times by Tesla and once by BMW.

Tesla's high loyalty and share results demonstrate a challenging situation for the rest of the industry. Not only are an unprecedented number of households acquiring a Tesla but a high proportion of these owners are sufficiently happy with their vehicles to acquire another one.

However the U.S. luxury landscape is changing and three newcomers have shown in their early days their ability to conquest Tesla owners. As the three charts below indicate the number one brand conquested by each of Lucid Polestar and Rivian in the first six months of 2022 is Tesla. Moreover one-third of Lucid's conquests and one-quarter of Rivian's are coming from Tesla owner families according to the S&P Global Mobility Household Loyalty Methodology (the newly acquired vehicle may be an addition to the household fleet.) One key indicator to Lucid and Rivian conquests: They are competing against the older-sheet metal vehicles in the Tesla lineup - the Model X and S - at premium price levels where consumers having the latest trendy item is seen as essential. Conversely Polestar is competing against the newer Model 3 and Y. If these trends continue these three EV luxury brands and other newcomers may offer a viable alternative to Tesla.

And to be fair neither are any consumer cars made by its competitors. But the words “self-driving” and “automatic” have long been embedded in the branding of Tesla’s driver assistance products such as Autopilot and Full Self-Driving softwares. Critics have questioned the integrity of Tesla’s marketing practice and legal experts say the company’s claims may have crossed the line of false advertising.

“Sometimes I feel I’m a victim of Elon Musk” said Johannes Himmelreich a professor at Syracuse University who studying the ethics of emerging technologies. Himmelreich said jokingly he’s been waiting for Tesla to deliver a self-driving vehicle to buy a new car but it just never happens. “Elon always says full self-driving is just around the corner. According to him it should have happened four years ago.”

The controversy recently escalated when the California Department of Motor Vehicles accused Tesla of deceptive marketing and threatened to revoke its sales license in California if the company fails to comply with the regulator’s requirements.

What is FSD and why does Tesla call it something that it’s not?

Currently all new Tesla cars come with a free driver assistance program called Autopilot which includes features like adaptive cruise control and lane centering. Customers have the option to upgrade for $15000 up front or $199 per month to a more advanced package called Full Self-Driving (FSD). FSD can perform complex tasks such as automatic lane-changing traffic light recognition on a pre-programmed route and “smart summon” a feature that allows a driver to summon their car from a parking spot to come pick them up.

Both Autopilot and FSD are classified as level 2 autonomous driving systems under the standards of the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). The SAE defines six levels of driving automation ranging from level 0 (fully manual) to level 5 (fully autonomous). These standards are adopted by the U.S. Department of Transportation. A level 2 designation means a human driver needs to stay alert at all times during a vehicle’s movement. Other company’s competing softwares including General Motors’ Super Cruise and Ford’s Co-Pilot360 ADAS are also level 2 autonomous driving systems.

Tesla doesn’t have an advertising or marketing department according to The Org a database of organizational charts of tech companies. It’s not unreasonable to speculate that branding decisions such as naming a driving software ultimately come from the top—its CEO—and are not open to differing opinions. On online discussion boards current and former Tesla employees have described a “fearmongering” company culture and “a heavy command-control vibe from senior leadership” in the office according to private posts on Team Blind a networking site for verified tech workers obtained by the Observer. Tesla which also doesn’t have a media relations department could not be reached for comment.

Tesla appears aware of the limitations of its software and how its branding might mislead consumers. Tesla released the first version of FSD called “FSD Beta” in October 2020 to a small group of customers. Five months later when the company expanded access to more drivers Musk cautioned in a tweet “The word ‘Beta’ is used to reduce complacency in usage and set expectations appropriately.” In small print on its website Tesla states that a human driver must pay full attention while using Autopilot or FSD capabilities.

But it seems Tesla has adopted a fake-it-till-you-make-it approach. Musk has on multiple occasions said Tesla is close to achieving level 5 automation. At an artificial intelligence conference in July 2020 for example he told an audience Tesla had the hardware to enable level 5 autonomy and that it “will happen very quickly.”

“It’s possible that Musk truly believes it because in many ways he lives in the future and has lost touch with reality—economically anyway” said Himmelreich. “But the worst part is that it ruins the meaning of these words for the rest of us. It makes it much harder to trust other self-driving car companies.”

In fact higher level autonomous driving systems do exist. Waymo a spinoff of Google’s self-driving car unit operates a fleet of robotaxis in Phoenix Arizona that are rated as level 4 autonomous driving meaning a vehicle can drive itself under limited geographic conditions and doesn’t need human supervision. Waymo CEO John Krafcik has scoffed at Musk’s optimism that FSD could one day live up to its name. “It is a misconception that you can simply develop a driver-assistance system further until one day you can magically jump to a fully autonomous driving system” he told a German magazine in an interview January 2021. (Musk responded in a tweet Tesla has more money and better technology than Waymo.)

Is it false advertising then?

Businesses make exaggerated claims about their products all the time. It’s legal as long as the claims cannot be objectively verified said William Scott Goldman an advertising law attorney in Washington D.C. In fact there is a legal term for such practice called “puffery.” An example of puffery would be promoting something as “the best in the world” or “No.1 in the country.” But knowingly labeling a software as “autopilot” or “full self-driving” when it’s actually a level 2 driver assistance program may have crossed the line of false advertising Goldman said.

In 2020 a court in Munich Germany ruled that Tesla had violated the European Union’s advertising law with the marketing of its Autopilot software. (FSD wasn’t available in Europe at the time.) However Tesla appealed the ruling and successfully had the verdict reversed in a higher German court in October 2021 on the condition that Tesla change some of the language on its website to clarify Autopilot’s capabilities.

Tesla hasn’t faced similar legal battles in the U.S. despite having sold Autopilot for six years and FSD for two. “It’s a little bit surprising that no consumer advocacy groups or individual consumers have brought up a false advertising lawsuit against Tesla” said Goldman.

That could change soon with the California DMV’s recent complaint in which the regulator argues the “Autopilot” and “Full Self-Driving” labels could mislead consumers into believing that Tesla cars can drive themselves according to a filing to California’s Office of Administrative Hearings a state administrative body on July 28.

“Usually when a government entity brings up an issue like this it will lead to a slew of consumer class actions. That’s probably a bigger concern for Tesla” said Jason Stiehl an attorney at Crowell & Moring a Washington D.C.-based law firm specializing in consumer class actions and advertising disputes.

In a letter to the California DMV on Aug. 12 Tesla requested a hearing to present its defense against these accusations. The DMV is currently in the discovery stage of the case and could negotiate a settlement with Tesla before a hearing whose date has yet to be determined said a spokesperson for the agency.

If the DMV prevails Tesla could lose its sales license in California. In the complaint the regulator said it demands that Tesla honestly advertise to consumers and better educate Tesla drivers about the actual capabilities of Autopilot and FSD.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMDkvdGVzbGEtZXZhbHVhdGluZy1saXRoaXVtLXJlZmluZXJ5LWluLXRleGFzLWZvci1lbGVjdHJpYy1jYXItYmF0dGVyaWVzLmh0bWzSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMi8wOS8wOS90ZXNsYS1ldmFsdWF0aW5nLWxpdGhpdW0tcmVmaW5lcnktaW4tdGV4YXMtZm9yLWVsZWN0cmljLWNhci1iYXR0ZXJpZXMuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla could start building a lithium refinery for EV batteries in Texas this year,"Elon Musk has expanded a number of his companies within Texas including Tesla SpaceX the Boring Co. and Neuralink. Tesla broke ground on a lithium refinery in Texas earlier this year with Governor Greg Abbott in attendance.

The price of lithium is up 120% this year according to an tracking index from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.

In April Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company may need to get into lithium refining because the cost of the metal had ""gone to insane levels.""

The company would process ""raw ore material into a usable state for battery production"" then ship the lithium hydroxide to various Tesla battery manufacturing factories the application said.

Tesla said the plant would be focused on the development of ""battery-grade lithium hydroxide"" and be ""the first of its kind in North America"" according to a newly released letter to the Texas Comptroller's Office.

Electric car giant Tesla is evaluating the feasibility of a lithium hydroxide refining facility on the gulf coast of Texas.

Tesla's move is also likely a bid to diversify the supply of its lithium and battery production. China controls more than half of the world's lithium processing and refining and the United States just 1%.

As part of the application to Texas the company said it is also considering ""other battery materials processing refining and manufacturing and ancillary manufacturing operations in support of Tesla's sustainable product line.""

If Tesla's application is approved construction could begin in the fourth quarter of 2022 the company said. The project will reach ""commercial operations"" by the fourth quarter of 2024.

Tesla said that it is still ""evaluating the feasibility of this project"" and ""only very preliminary development activities have begun.""

No engineering construction or procurement construction contracts have been negotiated or signed and no regulatory permits have been obtained Tesla said.

Musk's firm said the project could be located ""anywhere with access to the Gulf Coast shipping channel."" Tesla said it is evaluating a competing site in Louisiana.

Tesla said the only way this project will be viable is if Texas gives it tax breaks under its law.

""In the case of the investment on this proposed project in Texas the decision will be based on a number of commercial and financial considerations including the ability to obtain relief regarding local property taxes"" according to the application.

Lithium is a critical metal for batteries that go into everything from electric cars from smartphones. Given the strategic importance of such rare earth metals and China's mining dominance of them there has been concern from Washington that Beijing could cut off critical supplies of lithium and other materials.

The U.S. is looking to ramp up its own rare earth refining and mining industry to catch up with China.

Hsu is a professor of materials science and engineering in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) and holds the Texas Instruments Distinguished Chair in Nanoelectronics. She received her B.S.E. degree in chemical engineering from Princeton University her M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in physics from Stanford University and did her postdoctoral training at Bell Labs. Before UTD she worked at the University of Virginia Lucent Bell Labs and Sandia National Laboratories.

Hsu’s research focuses on nanoscale materials physics on a wide range of materials from superconductors to organic semiconductors. She has done extensive work on the electronic and photonic properties of materials and devices in particular the relationship between the microscopic atomic organization and macroscopic properties of complex materials consisting of dissimilar components such as organics and inorganics. Her current research activities include solution synthesis of metal oxides physics and application of emergent solar cells flexible printed electronics and materials processing using photons. Hsu has over 230 publications five patents and has given over 200 invited presentations at international meetings universities and research institutions.

Hsu is a fellow of the American Physical Society (APS) the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Materials Research Society (MRS). She is an Honorary International Chair Professor at Taipei Tech and was awarded a Hertz Foundation Fellowship APS Apker Award a National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award and a Sloan Foundation Research Fellowship. Her professional society services include MRS (meeting chair board of directors treasurer operational committee chair) APS (Division of Materials Physics executive committee award committee) and Electronic Materials Conference (organizer). She also served on the DOE Basic Energy Sciences advisory committee National Academies review panels and numerous external advisory committees.

Merging machine and human intelligence for energy materials research

Julia Hsu is an experimental materials physicist who has studied materials physics phenomena using traditional approaches such as performing optimization by varying one variable at a time (OVAT). In materials research optimization is ubiquitous but the outcomes are typically affected by a multitude of variables. Furthermore the various input parameters have complex and non-linear interrelationships creating a combinatorically vast space of possible experimental conditions that cannot be exhaustively tested in practice since performing experiments is time-consuming and expensive.

Hsu’s Pivot Fellowship discipline will be machine learning (ML) which is at the intersection of mathematics computer science and statistics and is now used in many aspects of modern life e.g. email spam filtering shopping product recommendation or speech recognition. Bringing ML into materials synthesis and processing can guide expensive experiments to make the most effective use of limited resources and elucidate the complex interdependence among the variables.

During the fellowship Hsu’s goals are to become proficient in ML approaches and apply them to optimization problems in materials synthesis and processing particularly energy materials. Her self-learning so far has highlighted big challenges in becoming truly versed in the new discipline including the different vocabularies and the wide variety of ML frameworks. The Pivot Fellowship offers an invaluable opportunity for me to be embedded in the research group of her mentor Tonio Buonassisi at MIT and learn how to effectively apply ML techniques to energy materials research. Not only will the mentorship shorten the time required for her to become proficient in the new field but it will also minimize the possibility of going in erroneous directions were she on her own. Conversely she brings domain expertise in diverse materials including polymers metal oxides semiconductors and hybrid materials that will advance ML beyond treating all problems with the same “black box” approach. Furthermore she believes that it would be more productive to augment the machine with materials science knowledge physics-based rules and prior experimental data instead of “cutting humans out of the loop.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNocm9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2hvdXN0b24tdGV4YXMvYXJ0aWNsZS9xdWVlbi1lbGl6YWJldGgtMTk5MS12aXNpdC1ob3VzdG9uLTE3NDI3NzYxLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A look back Queen Elizabeth II's 1991 visit to Houston and the Space Center,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/queen-elizabeth-1991-visit-houston-17427761.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNocm9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2hvdXN0b24tdGV4YXMvYXJ0aWNsZS9xdWVlbi1lbGl6YWJldGgtMTk5MS12aXNpdC1ob3VzdG9uLTE3NDI3NzYxLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rdnVlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL21vbmV5L2Vjb25vbXkvYm9vbXRvd24tMjA0MC9tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nL2NoaXBzLTEwMS1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLWNoaXAtc2hvcnRhZ2UtY2VudHJhbC10ZXhhcy1zYW1zdW5nLzI2OS1kYjFhYzAwMC1jMGE5LTQwZjEtOWE2OS0wNzU2NDdkNmNjNTXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Texas really started the whole revolution' | State continues to lead the US semiconductor chip industry,"""All of these important industries – automotive cloud [artificial intelligence] consumer electronics and even areas like industrial electronics and health care applications like wearables and then aerospace – these are all areas where semiconductor fabrication is a very important driver for all of these things"" Sreenivasan added. ""This is not just a supply chain issue. It's also staying at the leading edge because you know if you fall behind in the way these chips are made then the entire ecosystem suffers.""

""The semiconductor ecosystem [includes] many important parts of our economy. For example: cloud represented by companies like Microsoft and Google consumer electronics are represented by Apple and companies like that. And then even electric cars [are] represented by companies like Tesla which have a lot of compute. So a car is no longer just a vehicle it is also a computing device in many ways because it has a lot of sensors"" said Dr. SV Sreenivasan  the head of the Texas Institute of Electronics at the University of Texas at Austin.

Despite the near-constant semiconductor headlines leaders in the industry say many don't comprehend how wide-reaching and important the sector has become.

""In the '90s there was an organization called SEMATECH that operated out of Central Texas and it really was a consortium of new technologies to support the industry all over the world"" said Robb Misso  the VP of CelLink Corporation . ""It was something that we were very proud of.""

Texas has a deep history in the semiconductor industry. The creator of the modern semiconductor chip made the first integrated circuit in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. And a group of semiconductor industry leaders under the name SEMATECH called Austin home.

Cornyn's not wrong. For example the car you drive has thousands of semiconductor chips controlling pretty much every single major function from the brightness of the radio display to updating the digital odometer. They are the fourth-most traded good in the world behind crude oil processed oil and cars.

Semiconductors have dominated headlines since the pandemic started in March 2020 most commonly in reference to the global chip shortage . The microscopic computer chips control the creature comforts of modern society as well as lead national security from the touchscreens on our phones to the navigation systems on war missiles.

""The challenge when you produce [something that small] is getting everything right and eliminating any type of breakage or any type of contamination that could affect the performance of that"" Martino advised. ""To put that in perspective a skin flake is devastating at that size. So as you go into an advanced semiconductor facility it is designed so that the amount of particles in the air are so small and so few that they can't affect this. Which is why semiconductor manufacturing factory is so complex and so costly is because you're producing very small images and you need to keep the environment in the purest state in order for the end product to function.""

""We have lithography equipment developers we have furnaces or thin film capabilities actors probers"" Smith said. ""There are six distinct different pieces of equipment or business units that are part of this ecosystem that really provides technology that enables life … Our customers cannot make microchips without Tokyo Electron.""

""The lithography equipment is where we coat and develop [a wafer] with a photosensitive material and then it would move on to an etching tool or a deposition tool or a metallization tool"" said Larry Smith  the chairman of Tokyo Electron U.S. Holdings in Austin.

""Lithography is just a very expensive fancy camera to make it very simple. And let's say this camera might cost $250 million or more per camera"" Misso said. ""[Innovation] starts with the ability to print the lines of the circuit integrated circuit of a semiconductor chip smaller and smaller and smaller to add more and more devices on an a little small piece of real estate of silicon.""

Chips are typically made from silicon wafers. The wafers stretch about 12 inches across and can be cut into thousands of semiconductors. A process called lithography can cut the design into the chips using a combination of chemicals and machines.

""The best way to describe it in layman's terms it's a chip"" said Mark Pollard  COO at Astute Electronics . ""What does a chip do? You know normally it's a cellphone example. Do you have any idea what makes your cellphone work inside this really pretty glass packaging and the you know the shiny plastic? Does anyone stop and think what – how in the world it works?""

Looks like a speck of dust so we put it under a microscope! (S/o @Hunt_Wx for letting @EditorAndrew and I bother him this week to use the weather one) pic.twitter.com/cm6z2Tc4ss

CHIPS 101: Since April I’ve been working on this project to answer all the questions I’ve heard about semiconductor chips. 16 interviews from local experts to federal lawmakers to explain all aspects of these chips. Ever seen one? It’s circled in this pic iPhone X for scale. https://t.co/QRKVCjZwY0 pic.twitter.com/4S12mRT1Km

At the company's Austin facility Samsung manufactures semiconductors as small as 14 nanometers. At the Taylor facility the South Korea-based company will be manufacturing so-called advanced semiconductors that can range anywhere from 4 to 7 nanometers. Taylor would not confirm a more specific range for proprietary reasons.

""You've got people who are building houses and building skyscrapers that you can actually see. Picture kind of doing that type of thing on a silicon substrate that you can't even actually see what you're doing without a microscope or a tunneling electron microscope or [Structured Illumination Microscopy microscope]. It's very difficult"" said Jon Taylor  the corporate vice president of fab engineering and public affairs at Samsung Austin Semiconductor .

""There's conductors like metals that are used – like wires – and there's insulators that doesn't conduct electrons"" said Steve James  VP of fab operations at Infineon 's Austin facility. ""Semiconductors we can control whether they conduct or they don't conduct. That's how we can make a computer work.""

""What you do with that size which generation after generation you make it smaller and then you pack more circuits or switches and capacitors and resistors onto this device here that then performs the function of a little computer or it's sensing biometric data and it's working together to then change your temperature actuate"" Ron Martino  the head of Global Sales at NXP Semiconductor  added.

""If you look at a state-of-the-art semiconductor device made by for example Samsung in Austin or Intel you can fit roughly 1000 of these transistors side by side across the thickness of a human hair. That's how tiny they are"" said Dr. Sanjay Banerjee  the director of the Microelectronics Research Center at the University of Texas. ""They are much smaller than for example bacteria or human blood cells.""

Experts range in complexity when defining a semiconductor chip depending on who their audience is. Semiconductors make all modern technology operate and can be as small as 4 nanometers in size. For comparison your fingernail grows about 10 nanometers in 10 seconds according to people who have been in the industry for the past few decades.

For mainstream chips Taiwan makes about 60% China makes about 25% and the U.S. makes 12% with the final 3% being spread across other countries throughout the world according to McCaul and industry leaders.

""What if tomorrow President Xi decided to invade Taiwan? It would put him in control of 90% of the global supply of these important advanced semiconductor chips"" Congressman Michael McCaul (R-Austin) said.

""That's very unique technology that really Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has virtually a monopoly on"" Pollard said. ""China is just starting to get breakthroughs with that technology. It's very expensive to get the transistors that small. China has exploited that by filling the void for the larger wafer size and they focused on that. They didn't have the expertise. So they're now filling the void of the larger wafers for the older technology which is something I believe the U.S. is going to focus on quite a bit and the innovation to get smaller and smaller and smaller.""

""You care about the chip technology because let's say you're a gamer you want a vivid graphic experience you want to be fast you want to be responsive. You're working on your PC? You want it to be able to solve those problems. You want it to be able to edit your videos and your photo collection very very efficiently. In a laptop you want a long battery life and if you're running your business you're running on the cloud or a data center you want it to efficiently run your business operations. That is chip design"" Papermaster said.

AMD is currently a ""fab-less"" semiconductor company. It designs chips used in computers laptops and gaming consoles like the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5. Chip design according to Papermaster is what helps drive innovation and combination of advanced chips and mainstream chips.

""It's essential that we have a continuous pipeline of new technologies"" Mark Papermaster  chief technology officer at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)  said. ""Why do you need new technologies? Because the demand for computing just keeps going up and up and up. So you know if we didn't get new chip technology we'd be flatline. We'd have only the kind of capabilities that we have today and we couldn't grow to meet the demand.""

""If you look at [the] year 2000 about 18% of the cost of a car was due to the semiconductors in it and now it's 40%. And that number continues to increase"" said Taylor whose facility creates the semiconductor chips for Tesla.

""You'll need a mix always"" Banerjee said. ""The reason is with these tiny devices they cannot handle very high voltages because they will break down electrically. So there are applications in automotive for example where you're not operating the devices at the voltages that you have in your computer chips which can be as low as a few volts but instead have to operate at maybe hundreds of watts. So for those devices you really need larger dimensions so that it can withstand the higher operating voltages.""

""So you need all these other chips that are built in factories as you know maybe they're not the brand-new state-of-the-art factories because you can't really shrink those chips down to the the sub-10 nanometers you know geometries like in the new factory"" James continued. ""So it doesn't make sense to build them in those factories.""

""The newest most advanced chips are usually going in the brain applications because the CPU or the microcontroller those are the ones that really benefit from smaller and smaller transistors smaller and smaller memory"" James said. ""Around those chips or in other applications you've got power semiconductors to drive those motors you've got sensors you have other types of memory that can't go with small chips. For instance there's lots of other applications that surround that chip. That chip can't talk to the outside world. It can't power itself. It can't send signals you know can't connect to the internet just by itself.

At Infineon's Fab 25 facility in Austin the company makes these types of chips for businesses all over the country and the world.

""Most of the chips that go into cars are 40 nanometer and above"" said Tyson Tuttle  the retired CEO of Silicon Labs . ""These are very old old technologies that are still very useful. And in many many cases at Silicon Labs for instance you know we wouldn't want to put in the most advanced technology because it would be more expensive and it wouldn't actually be better.""

Most technology does not change as quickly as chips do leading to a necessary supply of what leaders call ""mainstream"" semiconductors or chips that are not the smaller size of ""advanced"" chips.

""Technology companies could all move out and put China in a very bad place"" Misso added. ""So it'll be interesting to see. It's not going to be driven by nations. It's not going to be driven by politicians. It's going to be driven by companies. And it's going to be driven by the semiconductor companies I believe. So in the geopolitical realm of how things are done and the power around the world I think you're to look at the Samsungs and the Microns and the Intels and the TSMC. They're going to really have a lot of a lot of pull in what happens.""

""Most of the countries that have a big semiconductor industry in the world have their own incentives already"" James said. ""So starting with China Taiwan Korea all over Europe there are already incentives. In a way we're just trying to level the playing field with the CHIPS Act.""

Cornyn and McCaul believe the CHIPS and Science Act will bring semiconductor makers back to the U.S. further diversifying where chips are made while improving competition. However business leaders say the one-time incentive won't be enough.

""During the Cold War nuclear missiles were the mutually assured destruction. Whether we want to call you know the economic or the competition with China a 'new Cold War' – but in that competition the mutually assured destruction is a few semiconductor factories in Taiwan. And it would dramatically impact us that you know we couldn't build a lot of the products you know a lot of those end products"" Tuttle added. ""For instance iPhones are built in China. And you would think that you know hostility breaks out that's where the end products are designed. You wouldn't have access to the semiconductors. It would drive the world into a global depression if that truly came to pass.""

""Fifty percent of the global fab capacity is in Taiwan. If there was a real conflict that broke out and let's say something happened to one of those fabs or there was an embargo you couldn't make those chips"" Tuttle said. ""Inside of a mobile phone for instance you might have 20 30 different chips inside that phone. If one of them comes from a factory in Taiwan and you lose access to that you can't make that product. If you lost truly lost the capacity that's in Taiwan today you almost couldn't build anything.""

Because of the world's reliance on semiconductors in modern society Tuttle worries any monopoly within in the industry needs to be spread to other companies and countries around the world.

""If you look at globalization and how you know any one product that's designed maybe getting components or materials from all across the globe you know whether it's you know mining for lithium or neon in the case of Ukraine or titanium or gold or you know a lot of these raw materials are where the manufacturing facilities are"" Tuttle said. ""If an earthquake or tsunami or something happens certainly as a semiconductor person and then in the industry you think 'Oh gosh there's some stuff that's coming from there that's going to impact and how are we going to deal with that?'""

""The [Texas Instruments] the Intels developed a lot of this early technology and because it was more cost effective to offshore a lot of this we didn't think a whole lot about it. The companies were profitable. We still had the cachet of being the developers of this but all the while these countries took what we had innovated built on it built the infrastructure to really outpace us both from an educational research and development to really building the infrastructure to continue at scale for the pace of the semiconductor industry"" Pollard said.

""In many regions of the world the cost of building that capability can be subsidized and many people drive incentives to attract companies"" Martino added. ""By passing the CHIPS Act the U.S. is taking a step to bring that technology to the U.S. for all the reasons we've talked about because the dependency on semiconductor chips and what they do for our life and our communities is pervasive now.""

""As far as a country like China that's raced ahead of us as far as production and their ability to do it how that controls so much of what we need to do to protect our resources our people our freedoms protect our allies protect our economy"" Pollard said. ""You know we tend to swing the big stick in the world and you see that power diminished – that's a scary prospect for a country like the U.S. We've let it slip because we were the innovators of this product. I don't think anyone knew how impactful it was going to be how the technology was going to evolve to the extent that it is today.""

The legislation provides more than $52 billion in incentives: $39 billion for production $13.2 billion for research and development and $500 million for communications and supply chain improvements.

""Really the motivation for the CHIPS Act was to provide subsidies to companies to build manufacturing facilities here and also to do advanced research and development around semiconductor manufacturing and to bring that portion of that back to the U.S. And if you look globally a lot of the countries out there – whether it's China Korea Japan Taiwan – provide significant incentives to build factories in those locations"" Tuttle said. ""So it's really a bit like you're leveling the playing field in terms of making it cost-competitive to build those facilities in the U.S. whereas before we would be at maybe a 30% 40% disadvantage in terms of cost if you built the factory here which is why the factories were being built in other locations.""

""There was a growing realization that from both an economic security standpoint as well as a national security standpoint it's important to have semiconductor manufacturing done within the U.S. to a certain extent and to kind of reverse that trend"" said Tuttle who worked with other semiconductor companies to lobby the federal government to pass the funding.

""If we didn't pass the bill the CEOs of these companies told me they'd have to go elsewhere. They would go to Europe they go to Asia to those markets"" McCaul added.

""This is something we're not accustomed to doing which is making these huge federal investments and incentives to have businesses come back onshore"" Cornyn said.

To try and claw back to semiconductor independence Cornyn and McCaul led the fight to pass the CHIPS Act in 2020. After going through a few name changes  more than 18 months of sitting in Congress and some renegotiation lawmakers approved the funding portion of the bill in July 2022 under the name ""CHIPS and Science Act.""

""Over the years we had this idea that if it could be made cheaper someplace else then that was a good thing"" Cornyn said. ""It is good for consumers by and large but when it's something that's absolutely essential to our economy and the technology advances that we continue to see in our national security that's where it became a game changer.""

""If we don't ensure that we have our own independence to create these chips control the products that they go into we're really at risk"" Pollard said. ""We're at risk of falling behind as a technological leader but there's a true risk as far as the threats of our foes and what they could do and and how they could potentially cause harm.""

In the 1990s U.S. produced between 30% to 40% of the world's chips. Since then American production has fallen behind while innovation has continued to surge.

""You've seen the evidence of that already because you know when I started in the field there probably were a few dozen companies in the U.S. which worked on semiconductor devices. And over time many of them have kind of fallen by the wayside"" Banerjee said. ""Scaling of these transistors will stop long before you reach the sizes of individual atoms because other limits of quantum physics start playing a role.""

Moore's law is named after Gordon Moore one of the founders of Intel. Moore theorized semiconductors would basically shrink in half every 18 to 24 months with more transistors on each chip. In the past 40 years that's held true according to Banerjee. But as shrinking semiconductors continues to drive up costs and push up against the physical limits of chips innovators will have to find another way to advance semiconductor development.

""As time has gone on and things get smaller and smaller the costs go up"" Tuttle said. ""It actually today is more expensive to design a logic gate or a transistor on a chip. The per-transistor cost is starting to go up because of the difficulty to continue to follow Moore's Law. I like to say that the end of Moore's Law – because we are rapidly approaching the point where we will not be able to shrink further or if we shrink further it will cost so much that it won't make sense it won't make economic sense.""

Banerjee added that advanced semiconductors are coming down to the size of viruses. Chips have a physical limit to how small they can be just by the nature of the size of atoms.

""Innovation pervades all these fields whether you're doing design or whether you're doing manufacturing. And so when you say 'America leads in innovation' not in all fields not in manufacturing. So TSMC is today the leader in semiconductor manufacturing and in innovating. So they have gotten ahead"" Sreenivasan continued. ""And so you know it is somewhat naïve to think that we are No. 1 in innovation in every field. You know there are just a lot of smart people around the world. And in some fields we are lagging behind. But by and large I agree that we innovate in many many fields. But in semiconductor fabrication we are not No. 1 today.""

""You've got such a strong university system and it's University of Texas in Austin but it's also of course Texas A&M and Texas State and across the region a great feeder pool of talent"" Papermaster added. ""That's sort of the foundation. If you can't get talent you can't be a leader in an industry.""

To ensure innovation continues to happen in the industry Papermaster sees university partnerships as one possible solution to expand the research and development pipeline.

""In semiconductor manufacturing if you go into the fabs you're building equipment and developing processes and measuring things at the nanoscale. We're down to sort of a few nanometers … To give you a sense for the smallest atom hydrogen is a 10th of a nanometer. So if you lay 100 atoms of hydrogen across that's about where we are today in what we do in a fab. That's by no means you know achieved without innovation"" Sreenivasan said.

""Innovation feeds manufacturing in five 10 years down the road"" Banerjee said. ""You have to innovate and that's where the universities come in. Because unless we do the leading-edge research and produce the Ph.D.s who work at these companies you know you kill the seed corn. You kill the innovation pipeline if you will. And then manufacturing will stop – not immediately maybe but you know maybe five 10 years down the line.""

Even if the industry oversupplies in the coming months or years researchers believe production and innovation go hand-in-hand to address growing demand.

""Historically what happens in this market – and this is kind of in cycles – we overshoot the market and all of a sudden then we have a period of time where we have too much production too much equipment there's been too many people hired. And we go into a downturn or a downswing in the market"" Misso said. ""My biggest concern is that's exactly what will happen. Right now there's a lot of overreaction for us not having the capacity today to support the need from three months ago or six months ago. But I do believe it'll catch up very quickly. And when it does catch up I think we'll overshoot.""

""There's going to be ups and downs"" Pollard said. ""There's cycles [are] very much like the energy markets. I believe that we're going to see a little bit of softening in terms of the constricted supply. It's going to ebb and flow a little bit but it's largely going to continue for the next 12 to 18 months. We can really only see and predict three-quarters ahead of time roughly but it's going to continue. And then much like an energy correction it's going to correct. We're going to be oversupplied whether it's a global recession that just you know related to inflation you know the interest rates that we're reading about just to control the growth and control inflation.""

""Austin has a incredible tech legacy. Semiconductors are the foundation of that"" said Ed Latson  founder of the Austin Regional Manufacturers Association. ""You know you look back to Motorola and the work that they were doing IBM – it's really evolved and accelerated over the last 10 years especially. You know now you have world-class companies like Samsung Semiconductor you know Infineon you have this incredible commitment from Applied Materials to the region Tokyo Electron. They're all incredibly busy right now and trying to keep up with this global demand for chips.""

Kilby introduced the first integrated circuit in 1958. Since then the semiconductor industry has boomed in Texas – especially in the Austin area which is always growing and innovating.

""Texas really started the whole revolution"" Banerjee said. ""I started my life at Texas Instruments . The first integrated circuit was invented by Jack Kilby who in fact won the Nobel Prize in physics for our invention of the IC. So that happened in Dallas Texas. Texas Instruments was also the company that made the first silicon transistor.""

While the U.S. has fallen behind in the market share for global production industry leaders in the country have led innovation from the outset.

Growing pains for a strong industry :

According to the Texas Comptroller for Public Accounts the semiconductor sector of the manufacturing industry is one of the fastest-growing areas of the Texas economy. In 2020 the industry contributed $15.3 billion to the Texas GDP. Texas semiconductors made up 15% of the U.S. semiconductor GDP in that same year according to the comptroller's office.

In 2020 the semiconductor industry made up more than a quarter of all Texas exports. In terms of jobs more than 41000 Texans work in the sector. Fourteen-thousand of those jobs are in Travis and Williamson counties.

""That kind of rapid growth is really good. That does put some short-term pressure on the workforce"" said Bryan Daniel the chairman for the Texas Workforce Commission. ""There's really just this need for us to do a continued education reevaluation of our skills and just upskilling and reskilling in kind of a continuous basis in the workforce.""

As more companies in the industry move to and expand in Texas that means they all pull from the same pool of resources for the workers water energy and raw materials needed to make semiconductors and the machines that make those chips. To widen the pipeline of workers state leaders like Daniel as well as industry leaders look to job-training programs school districts and local colleges to train the next generation of semiconductor employees.

""Those jobs have now changed"" said Dr. Laura Marmolejo associate dean for manufacturing education at Austin Community College. ""Everything's robotic controlled automation. And so all the jobs now require some degree of knowledge.""

""Central Texas has brought a lot of high tech businesses into a single area like a Silicon Valley and they also are investing in different educational initiatives that helps build a strong workforce population that can work in the factories and related jobs"" Martino said. ""Also there's a university very strong university capability in Austin and Dallas and throughout Texas that helps create innovative innovative environment.""

""Even the very entry-level ones need a little bit of knowledge because these machines are much more sophisticated than they've ever been"" Marmolejo said adding ""It's not all engineers. There's so many levels that people can get into. So if you're the guy who just doesn't want to go to college no problem. We can get you in that industry in eight weeks with a short program that gives you some fundamentals.""

Workforce development will need to lead the growth in the industry experts and leaders agree. But that means supporting that workforce too.

""Some of my concerns having spent a year in Silicon Valley I know very well what it can end up being and that is the massive growth"" Taylor said. ""You know you've got to have the roads and you've got to have the housing and all those things. The technology in these great companies are going to bring people in but we also have to care for the people who are going to live here. You know when I worked in California I had technicians that would travel three hours one way to get to work in Santa Clara and then three hours home. They're on the road for six hours a day.""

Those looking at the big picture for the industry agree that there needs to be support systems in place that allow the growth to continue.

""We're going to grow into this but we've got to be deliberate in that growth"" Daniel said. ""We can't hope for the best. We've really got to do some planning and we've all got to kind of get on the same page. That ripple effect for the economy becomes part of the economy at some point.""

The ripple effect in the economy leads to job growth outside the semiconductor industry too.

""The semiconductor industry sector has a jobs multiple of seven which means we roughly have 250000 Americans working directly in the semiconductor industry but they also spin off 1.8 million more jobs"" said Tony Bennett president of the Texas Association of Manufacturers. ""So that is 250000 direct jobs times seven you get the 1.8 million that is critical to all of our sectors. But you know this is one sector that produces an exponentially large amount of indirect jobs which is important for the U.S. and the Texas economy.""

Between the direct and indirect jobs James added there are those jobs that support the semiconductor manufacturers like Samsung Infineon and NXP in Austin like Applied Materials and Tokyo Electron which make the machines to make the chips.

""There's you know four to five times ancillary jobs that are supporting us that are out there"" James said.

Even as a design company Papermaster noted the industry in Central Texas both works together and competes against each other.

""What you'll find when you look at the semiconductor industry is it's a partner-and-compete model that all of us have in the industry"" Papermaster said. ""Of course we compete. We compete on the design of our products and the markets that we go after and tailor those products to. But we partner on helping make sure that common problems can be addressed and so that is that the universities can provide us the kind of skilled pool that we need and that's to make sure that we have the right standards so that any one of our chips can work [together] with one of the other [company's] chips.""

While semiconductor facilities hire thousands of people they also use a huge amount of resources. Experts are hopeful.

""The workforce aspects you know Texas is very favorable there"" Tuttle said. ""The construction costs the land costs the availability of water and power which each of these factories requires you know reliable and substantial energy and water resources to be able to continue to grow.""

""The past couple of years certainly we had some issues with the energy you know for Winter Storm Uri. But I feel pretty confident those are resolved"" Latson said.

""We had the winter storm and now the war in Ukraine can have some effect on raw material supplies where chemicals go and what's available and that sort of thing"" Bennett said. ""There seems to always be something here of late that is challenging the industry.""

While the industry faces these challenges head-on a combination of new research and near-constant growth in demand may lead to another issue: what to do with older chips that are no longer made but are still needed in products like laundry machines or used cars.

""You think about all this demand demand demand or people keep consuming. Where does all that go? Because this is actual hardware even if it's getting smaller where does it all go at the end of the day?"" Pollard asked. ""The e-waste the e-recycling the environmental impact of all this material is a huge question. I don't have the right answer for it right now … But when your phone becomes obsolete doesn't work and it's already been changed hands three or four times and it's finally just dead how many hundreds of millions of phones and computers and devices are like that? What does the industry agree upon and what do the governments agree on as in how do we manage that? And that's something that's probably not a priority in the current situation but should come up and should be discussed. And we want to be on the forefront of that. I believe in the near future there's going to be requirements on companies that are procuring chips for their assemblies and their devices and a responsibility to what happens at that product at the end of that life. And like we do in the supply chain we will probably help facilitate that process in some way.""

With these water power and workforce challenges the cost of building new facilities continues to rise too. Samsung has already dedicated $17 billion to a single new fab in Taylor. That price tag is consistent across the industry.

""Most of the factories you know the most expensive tools in any of these factories are these photolithography tools"" Taylor said. ""We're talking over $100 million for one tool. So when you build a factory about two-thirds of the costs are actually the equipment for the process. About one-third of the cost is the building itself.""

Within the building and inside the manufacturing area itself companies have to install so-called ""clean rooms."" Even a single speck of dirt or static electricity can ruin an entire wafer of chips. When workers arrive for their shift they put a ""bunny suit"" on over their clothing walk over a rubber mat to ground their natural electric charge and enter through an air shower that sucks away any spare dust or particulate matter.

""Why is that important? That's important because if one tries to make these computer chips in a room like [my office] you know to our naked eyes it looks pretty clean right? But if you used a high-powered microscope you would see these dust particles floating around and these would be like gigantic boulders that are falling on your chips when you try to manufacture them and nothing would function properly"" Banerjee said.

The semiconductor industry won't go away for decades according to many of the people interviewed for this ""CHIPS 101"" project. For the time being almost all are optimistic about its growth and the role Central Texas will play.

""We're adding the technologies of the future"" Latson said. ""You know we have really interesting things happening around energy electric vehicles. You know communication and semiconductors are empowering that. But they're not only powering it they're being made here as well. So you know when I think about the future technology I think Central Texas is really well poised for several decades of growth and being a significant contributor to a global economy in a way that most regions can't be.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nbG9iZW5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2UvMjAyMi8wOS8wOS8yNTEzMzg4LzAvZW4vQmx1ZXRvb3RoLTUtMC1NYXJrZXQtV29ydGgtNy0wLUJpbGxpb24tQnktMjAyNy1FeGNsdXNpdmUtUmVwb3J0LWJ5LU1hcmtldHNhbmRNYXJrZXRzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bluetooth 5.0 Market Worth $7.0 Billion By 2027 – Exclusive Report by MarketsandMarkets,"Chicago Sept. 09 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bluetooth 5.0 Market is projected to grow from USD 4.1 billion in 2022 to USD 7.0 billion by 2027 at a CAGR of 11.0% from 2022 to 2027 according to a new report by MarketsandMarkets™.

The US government’s Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act 2022 aims to incentivize technology companies to build semiconductor factories in the country. However companies accepting federal funding for the same are barred from building high-tech facilities in China for the next 10 years.

Satya Gupta chief executive and founder of Electronic Products Innovation Consortium (EPIC) Foundation said that while in the short term the US will benefit from these policies in the medium term i.e. three years or more it could benefit markets like India.

“The $50 billion plus incentives from the US may be utilized by then and firms will look to expand globally and India would be a good choice. By then markets like India too will have evolved to a stage where these global firms will see benefit in setting up advanced semiconductor manufacturing here"" he said.

Introduced on 9 August the new US law comes amid tensions with China. While the scheme aims to strengthen the US manufacturing base experts believe the 10-year embargo on high-tech manufacturing in China will eventually drive firms to markets like India Europe and Vietnam.

The US scheme offers incentives totalling $53 billion (around ₹4.2 trillion) for firms building chip factories in the US. These are more than five times India’s ₹76000 crore (approximately $10 billion) production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for chipmakers announced earlier this year.

Among the world’s top 10 chip design and manufacturing firms US chipmakers earned 33.2% of $59.5 billion that global semiconductor companies earned in 2021 according to an April 2022 report by market researcher Gartner. Samsung Intel SK Hynix Micron Qualcomm Broadcom MediaTek Texas Instruments Nvidia and AMD comprised the top 10. Other than Samsung MediaTek and SK Hynix the rest are American firms.

The White House said Micron and Qualcomm plan to build new facilities in the US. While Micron plans to spend $40 billion by 2030 to make memory chips in the US Qualcomm will partner with GlobalFoundries for a $4.2 billion chip-manufacturing plan in the US. Intel which initially announced a $20 billion semiconductor fab in Ohio said in June that its plan was delayed to understand the CHIPS Act. The company now plans to begin work on its factory by end-2022 and production is expected to begin by 2025.

India currently does not have an ecosystem in place for advanced semiconductor manufacturing. However conglomerates such as the Tata group and Vedanta have expressed interest in setting up chip operations here and the government has also received interest from some global firms. Commerce minister Piyush Goyal met executives of American chip companies such as LAM Research and Applied Materials on 8 September to explore greater collaboration with Indian companies.

In April Applied Materials said it plans to invest $50 million in a new research and development (R&D) facility in India while Mint reported last month that LAM Research plans to set up its second R&D facility in India this month.

“India has already introduced a production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme to attract global clients. Alongside this it’s not like India has no existing ecosystem of the semiconductor industry—the semiconductor laboratory (SCL) in Mohali Punjab manufactures semiconductor chips in partnership with local and Israeli suppliers"" noted Vivek Tyagi chairman of industry body Indian Electronics and Semiconductor Association (IESA).

Rajeev Khushu adviser and board member of IESA said that semiconductor supply chain vendors in India do not have the necessary quality to match the global standards required for making the latest generation chips. SCL for instance still makes 180nm chips at its facility.This according to both Khushu and Tyagi could see semiconductor fabs come up in India over the next five years as global tech firms look at markets beyond Taiwan Korea and China to set up advanced facilities.

“India has already seen some interest from vendors to set up assembly testing marking and packaging (ATMP) facilities in the country based on the semiconductor PLI scheme which could precede the establishment of chip factories since the latter would take larger sums of investment"" Khushu said.

Navkendar Singh associate vice-president at market research firm International Data Corp (IDC) India said “What China has succeeded in doing has been to bring down the pricing of chips thanks to vastly available and affordable skilled labour and the overall scale of manufacturing. This could be a factor that semiconductor firms struggle to meet in the immediate future.""

Singh added that moving the manufacturing of chips away to other markets (including India and the US) could see companies incur a higher cost of manufacturing.

“It is also unlikely that any company will ever put all their eggs in one basket again so India will likely not be the sole beneficiary of the US‘ new law. The overall impact could see India make gains in the semiconductor space in the long run but it will most likely not be the only nation taking advantage of the diversification of the semiconductor supply chain"" Singh added.

One contract is for intermediate depot-level maintenance and logistics support for more than 200 US Navy Boeing T-45 Goshawk trainer aircraft Rolls-Royce F405 engines.

The $1 billion contract will be based on the availability metrics of engines needed to operate for training naval and marine pilots.

Works for the contract will be performed at naval air stations in Mississippi and Kingsville Texas.

The other contract includes depot-level engine repair services for Lockheed Martin KC-130J Hercules and C-130J Super Hercules transport Rolls-Royce AE 2100D3 turboprop engines in aircraft flown by the US Marine Corps and Kuwait.

Works for the $854 million contract will be performed at multiple sites in the US Canada and Portugal.

“We are committed to providing the best engine service possible for our customers and we are laser focused on ensuring their aircraft are mission ready” Rolls-Royce Defense Services President Adam Riddle said.

“We appreciate this vote of confidence from the U.S. Department of Defense as we continue to support our brave men and women in uniform.”

Rolls-Royce Engines in the US Military

Rolls-Royce engines power many aircraft in the US armed forces including the Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk and MQ-4C Triton high-altitude unmanned vehicles and the Boeing V-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft.

The firm’s engines also power the US Navy’s Boeing MQ-25 Stingray unmanned refueling aircraft.

The company won a $2.6 billion contract in 2021 to support the USAF’s commercial engine replacement program for its Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bomber aircraft.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhcmhpc3RvcnlvbmxpbmUuY29tL3dlYXBvbnMveG0yMDQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Top Attack Munition That Could Forever Replace Landmines on the Battlefield - XM204,"The XM204 is a portable anti-tank munition that provides the launch of up to four top-attack munitions. By hitting the enemy from a top-down position it not only ensures better accuracy in hitting a target but also reduces the possibility of accidentally hitting friendly forces. Above all the XM204 could effectively replace landmines altogether.

The XM204 could potentially replace landmines

The XM204 interim wide area top attack munition was developed to deny enemy forces the ability and freedom to maneuver armored vehicles. The need for the system was identified by US Army Europe and Africa with its main objective being to target and deter near-peer enemy vehicles in open terrain. This is because top attack munitions are more effective than front or bottom attack ones against armored vehicles and other such targets.

The device can be operated remotely and once the munition detects the sound of threat vehicles it begins to track them. When said vehicles reach a certain distance from the XM204 it launches a top attack munition that shoots a submunition into the air to fire a warhead at the targets.

“It can ‘hear’ tracked vehicles and feel them coming” said Steve Patane a test officer at Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona.

The device itself is also equipped with a self-destruct system with a variety of settings to prevent the possibility it will lay dormant for years (or decades) after a conflict has come to a close. This is a vast improvement on older landmine munitions as those lost in the terrain remain dormant ready to detonate.

The XM204 could save soldiers’ lives

One of the intended benefits of the XM204 is its ability to provide sufficient defense when a small unit of soldiers faces being outnumbered and out-maneuvered. Should the enemy be heavily equipped and manning heavy tracked vehicles the group can deploy the easily-portable XM204 to help them hold down their position until reinforcements arrive.

The device itself is the size of a large suitcase and has been redeveloped to feature handles for easier transportation. This was determined through feedback provided by combat engineers during a soldier touchpoint at Fort Leonard Wood Missouri.

“The butterfly design for the battery box came from the same Soldier touch point” added Lt. Col. Isaac Cuthbertson the product manager for Terrain-Shaping Obstacles when speaking about what else resulted from the feedback.

Yuma Proving Ground

Yuma Proving Ground (YPG) has allowed for the testing of various weapons including the XM204. There weapons undergo a series of tests to determine their strengths weaknesses durability and their ability to perform in real-world situations.

For the XM204 operators drove vehicles such as infantry fighting vehicles and main battle tanks (MBTs) across the testing track using various speeds and paths to determine the top attack munition’s accuracy. Using its sensors it tracked the vehicles and determined an algorithm to deploy munitions at the most favorable time. It took into account the size and speed of the vehicles in order to determine the optimal deployment.

As the vehicles were driven by real people the purpose of these tests was to determine the accuracy of the munition’s sensors. Instead of detonating its high explosive (HE) top attack rounds the XM204 used a camera to take pictures of what would be the point at which the munitions would hit if deployed. When HE rounds were tested the Army used remote-controlled vehicles.

Contract awarded to Textron Systems

On July 21 2022 the US Army Contracting Command awarded US defense firm Textron Systems with a $353980000 firm-fixed-price contract for the production and delivery of the XM204. The Army has ordered 117 of the top attack munitions as well as 38 trainer units and any necessary spare parts.

Delivery of the first XM204 units is scheduled for fiscal year 2023. Speaking about the contract Henry Finneral the senior vice president of Textron Systems said “We are supporting the Army’s urgent need with an anti-vehicle munition that helps soldiers control the physical landscape. XM204 is a modern solution at a time when modernization is a top priority for our customer.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9jdHBvc3QvbmFtZS9yYXltb25kLWhpbmRzLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM2NDYwNTc40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Raymond Hinds Obituary (2022) - Bridgeport CT - Connecticut Post,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/ctpost/name/raymond-hinds-obituary?id=36460578 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9jdHBvc3QvbmFtZS9yYXltb25kLWhpbmRzLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM2NDYwNTc40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRlZmVuc2Vwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzA5L3VzLW5hdnktbGl0ZW5pbmctc3VwZXItaG9ybmV0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US Navy Northrop Test Autonomous Target Tracking Pod on Super Hornet,"Northrop Grumman has completed the first flight tests of its LITENING advanced targeting pod on the F/A-18 Super Hornet.

The trials follow the US Navy’s replacement of its Hornet legacy targeting pods with the system earlier this year.

During the trials pilots conducted maneuvers and combat operations including ground-moving target tracking air-to-air tracking and target designation.

They also tested LITENING’s eye-safe training laser mode which provides realistic training with combat controllers on the ground.

The pilots had not received advanced training before the flight tests to demonstrate the LITENING pod’s ease of use according to the company.

“This first flight demonstrated LITENING’s ability to rapidly add modern upgradeable mission capabilities to the Super Hornet” Northrop Grumman Navigation Targeting and Survivability Vice President James Conroy said.

“The pod’s digital video autonomous target tracking and laser sensors will give Naval aviators an entirely new set of capabilities for operations over land and sea today and the growth capabilities built into LITENING’s modular design ensure that the pod can evolve to meet changing requirements.”

We explore the potential of self- amplifying RNA and circular RNA in the future of drug development.

SARS-CoV-2 is not the first viral crisis the world has faced and it will not be the last—a stark reminder that we must invest in technologies that can help develop effective vaccines quickly and safely. We have all come to realize that mRNA is a powerful therapeutic modality; mRNA vaccines were rapidly designed developed manufactured and approved to counter the rising threat—and for the most part they have been accepted by patients. Following mRNA’s newfound success pharmaceutical stakeholders are keen to delve into applications beyond SARS- CoV-2. Vaccines against other infectious diseases and enhanced personalized medicines for cancer are both possibilities using an mRNA-based approach.

Unlike traditional (protein-based) biopharmaceuticals the mRNA manufacturing process is cell-free making it simpler. However to move forward the industry must improve its collective understanding of mRNA. Manufacturers are still tackling the twin issues of quality and stability—the reason why mRNA-based products require ultra-low storage temperatures which limits how and where they can be used. Equally concerning is the lack of clear and thorough regulatory guidance; there are no well-defined acceptance criteria for mRNA therapeutics. Yes regulators were supportive of companies’ vaccine development programs throughout the coronavirus crisis but there is still far to go before robust guidelines are established for the development of therapeutics beyond SARS-CoV-2. For example knowledge around impurity profiles and critical quality attributes must be enhanced so that companies can improve their understanding of what can be accepted and released as a final drug or vaccine.

The sequence design of saRNA and circRNA is crucial; saRNA must self-amplify correctly when delivered to the cell and circRNA must contain expression elements that allow it to be translated in cells.

As well as improving upon traditional mRNA investment is also being directed to other RNA formats particularly self- amplifying (saRNA) and circular RNA (circRNA). The unique structures of saRNA and circRNA mean that smaller doses—almost 10 times less— can be administered to patients. An additional benefit? Once administered the expression of these molecules can last for a longer period. Therefore companies can expect to save costs by manufacturing lower volumes while also reducing the dose burden for patients. Lower doses could also translate to fewer potential side effects.

Therapies of the future



There are several key differences in molecular structure between traditional mRNA saRNA and circRNA. Traditional mRNA has a linear form that includes a poly(A) tail and cap. As the name suggests saRNA can replicate using molecular machinery that is not present in traditional mRNA molecules. It still has a poly(A) tail and cap but the overall size of the RNA is larger than traditional mRNA (the additional sequence is required to drive self-amplification). circRNA is a closed-loop structure formed from a single strand; as such it has no poly(A) tail or cap. Importantly the closed- loop structure offers protection from exonuclease degradation improving the stability of circRNA which is very compelling from a drug development point of view.

The sequence design of saRNA and circRNA is crucial; saRNA must self- amplify correctly when delivered to the cell and circRNA must contain expression elements that allow it to be translated in cells. These structural differences result in processing differences. For instance as circRNA does not have a poly(A) tail or cap synthesis is more streamlined but this can present challenges downstream because you cannot use a purification method that relies on capturing by the poly(A) tail. Therefore different purification approaches will be required for circRNA. saRNA is significantly larger than traditional mRNA molecules which leads to challenges during production such as increased product-related impurities during synthesis and lower binding capacities in chromatography steps due to its larger size. We must consider how we can improve the overall process—after all the level of impurities and ability of a molecule to bind within a column directly affects production costs and time as well as the manufacturing footprint.

Perhaps an even more complex challenge facing saRNA- and circRNA- based therapeutics is the inability to use modified nucleotides upon which today’s approved mRNA vaccines rely on to minimize immunogenicity. Ongoing research is exploring this complex issue—another balancing act between immunogenicity and efficacy.

A Truly Exciting Modality

Why is RNA technology so compelling?

For Pirkko Muhonen nucleic acid–based therapeutics have always been an exciting topic. “mRNA and the mRNA production workflow has been an interest of mine even before I joined the Nucleic Acid Therapeutics team at Thermo Fisher Scientific earlier this year. When SARS-CoV-2 hit and conversations about mRNA vaccine manufacturing really took off my colleagues and I were able to seize the opportunity to take part in this important and exciting technology development. It’s incredible to see how the field has evolved in such a short space of time.”

For Sirat Sikka RNA was an intriguing topic long before SARS-CoV-2. “It was easy to synthesize and purify. It took less than a week to generate RNA expressing the target protein. It was fascinating. The significant therapeutic potential was evident and a simple rapid process was an advantage. There is still so much to discover. In time there may be other formats and formulations that could help us find new and better ways of tackling vaccines for various diseases gene editing diagnosis and targeting cardiovascular and central nervous system diseases. It’s a very exciting time.”

Time to prioritize



Process development and manufacturing challenges continue to be investigated with fervor. Calls for improved regulatory guidance particularly when it comes to analytical method development will undoubtedly continue and increase in volume. At the same time process improvements and optimization to increase yield and drive costs down are just getting started.

SARS-CoV-2 has accelerated the acceptance of mRNA in vaccines and the amount of new investment entering the field gives drug developers an unprecedented opportunity to explore the modality and dig into how the different formats can be best used to target different diseases—not only as therapeutics but potentially as diagnostics as well. saRNA and circRNA may not necessarily replace traditional mRNA formats but they do represent new approaches with certain benefits including lower costs.

At Thermo Fisher Scientific we recognize RNA as an important modality for the future. We are investing heavily to develop products and solutions to help customers boost their understanding of the modality while also working on streamlining and simplifying processes to lower production costs. We are in constant communication with customers working on RNA technologies and we are learning alongside them to innovate and deliver solutions and services that help with all aspects of RNA manufacturing including synthesis purification and formulation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNTk4LTAyMi0xOTU0OS150gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Venular amyloid accumulation in transgenic Fischer 344 Alzheimer's disease rats | Scientific Reports,"Morphological differences between arteriolar and venular amyloid

Previous literature suggests that vascular amyloid deposits are not exclusive to cerebral arterioles122. We sought to characterize the amyloid deposits in TgF344-AD rats using histopathology with amyloid dyes and Aβ-specific antibodies and to confirm Aβ within vascular amyloid using laser capture microscopy and mass spectrometry. Thus we first set out to characterize the Aβ deposits in the TgF344-AD rat model of Alzheimer’s disease across disease progression (Fig. 1). We demonstrate both arteriolar and venular amyloid deposits associated with vessel walls that visually increase in volume with disease progression. The arteriolar amyloid deposits demonstrate globular deposits at 7-months of age that progressed to the classical ring-type structures surrounding arterioles by 16 months of age (Fig. 1a b). In contrast venular amyloid deposits resembled globular arteriolar amyloid at 7-months of age and remained globular even as disease progressed (Fig. 1c d). An increase in the number of globular deposits and the size of these deposits was observed as disease progressed (Fig. 1c d). Moreover ~ 12% and ~ 20% of the Thioflavine S (ThioS)-positive amyloid deposits appeared cellular in shape and were localized within the lectin-stained venules at 7 months and 16 months of age respectively. This is consistent with a previous report that demonstrated monocytes surrounding Aβ-laden venules10.

Figure 1 Morphology of ThioS-positive vascular amyloid in arterioles and venules with disease progression. Vascular amyloid was stained with ThioS (red) which targets proteins rich in β-sheet structures at 7 months and 16 months of age. Arteriolar amyloid at 7 months (a) demonstrates small amyloid deposits that progressed to a cyclical ring-like structure (white arrows) surrounding the arterioles at 16 months (b). Arterioles (a b) are distinguished from venules (c d) by labelling with alpha smooth muscle actin (green). Venular amyloid deposits remained globular in shape (white triangle) from 7 months (c) to 16 months of age (d) with presence of deposits appearing cellular in shape (white asterisks). Images were acquired with a 40 × objective. Full size image

Amyloid has been characterized using structure-based dyes including Congo red ThioS and methoxy-X04 which label three-dimensional β-sheet structured proteins including but not restricted to Aβ1231826. To visually identify the presence of Aβ arteriolar and venular amyloid throughout the cortex was immunolabeled with five anti-Aβ antibodies covering distinct epitopes across the entire Aβ sequence; MOAB-2 [epitope: amino acids 1-4] 6E10 [epitope:1-16] 4G8 [epitope:17-24] Aβ 40 [epitope:x-40] and Aβ 42 [epitope: x-42]. Cortical regions including the cingulate motor somatosensory secondary auditory and insular cortices were investigated at 7 months (Fig. 2a c) 10 months 13 months (Supplementary Fig. S1) and 16 months of age (Fig. 2b d). With anti-Aβ antibodies positive immunolabeling is dependent on the availability of the primary sequence of Aβ thus an antigen retrieval step was performed. For this reason the morphology of the vascular deposits identified with anti-Aβ antibodies is distinct from amyloid stains such as ThioS. In arterioles ThioS identified thick sheets of amyloid circling the lectin-stained vessels whereas Aβ immunolabeled with the anti-Aβ antibodies were thinner and spread throughout the arterioles particularly along and outside the edge of the vessel where the perivascular spaces are located. There was a noticeable increase in arteriolar amyloid with disease progression after visualization with 4G8 and 6E10 (Fig. 2a b). In addition Aβ visualized using the N-terminus specific antibody MOAB-2 were dotted around the arterioles mostly compressed around alpha smooth muscle actin at 7 months of age (Fig. 2a) that progressively circled the arteriole at 10 13 (Supplementary Fig. S1) and 16 months of age (Fig. 2b). As disease progresses there was noticeably more Aβ 42 - than Aβ 40 - positive staining (Fig. 2a b). In venules all antibodies stained Aβ as globular shaped deposits that were smaller than those detected with ThioS and adhered to the edge of the vessel (Fig. 2c d). Analyzing MOAB-2 4G8 and 6E10 immunolabeling there was an increase in fluorescence intensity from 7 to 16 months of age where the globular deposits became larger in size (Fig. 2c d). As was detected for arterioles venular amyloid demonstrated noticeably more Aβ 42 immunolabeling than Aβ 40  suggesting that Aβ 42 was preferentially deposited in venules over Aβ 40 . Alternatively Aβ 40 is known to bind preferentially to vascular amyloid92728 however TgF344-AD rats overexpress APP containing the Swedish mutation and PS1ΔE9 both of which increase the production of Aβ 42 over Aβ 40 .

Figure 2 Arteriolar and venular amyloid stained with Aβ antibodies to visualize vascular Aβ. Aβ antibodies MOAB-2 4G8 6E10 Aβ 40  and Aβ 42 (red) target specific amino acid regions of the Aβ peptide sequence allowing for a comprehensive visualization of vascular Aβ. Arteriolar Aβ initially deposits around alpha smooth muscle actin (green) labelling the arterioles at 7 months of age (a) while amyloid circles the arterioles at 16 months of age (b). An increase was also shown in venular Aβ with globular deposits increasing in size and number between 7 (c) and 16 months of age (d). Images were obtained at 40 × objective. Full size image

The Aβ peptide and other AD-associated proteins were identified in venular amyloid

To confirm the presence of Aβ peptides within venular deposits a combination of the laser capture microscopy and mass spectrometry was utilized. We collected enriched samples of parenchymal arteriolar and venular amyloid deposits from 12- and 16-month-old TgF344-AD rats23. Cortical plaques were isolated from the motor somatosensory auditory piriform entorhinal and ectorhinal cortices while arteriolar and venular amyloid were obtained from the cingulate motor somatosensory secondary auditory and insular cortices. We pooled 1600 parenchymal 1900 arteriolar and 7700 venular amyloid samples for the mass spectrometry experiments. The difference in the number elements isolated for each amyloid sample is a result of the difference in deposit size with parenchymal plaques being more dense and much larger than vascular amyloid. Meanwhile venular amyloid forms smaller globular deposits compared to arteriolar amyloid (Fig. 1) and thus the necessity for increased elements to accommodate detection limits of the mass spectrometer. Proteomic analysis was conducted on the Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid Mass Spectrometer containing Quadrupole Technology with an ultrahigh resolving power for increased accuracy and specificity towards proteins/peptides of small molecular sizes. The total spectrum counts from each sample identified Aβ (Table 1). Three Aβ peptide fragments that were detected: human Aβ sequence (DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQK) rat Aβ sequence (DAEFGHDSGFEVR) and human and rat Aβ sequence (LVFFAEDVGSNK) (Table 1). Previous literature has demonstrated in vivo that rat Aβ co-aggregates with human Aβ which is observed in these plaque samples29. Overall the data demonstrates Aβ to be more abundant in the plaques and arteriolar amyloid compared to venular amyloid.

Table 1 Total spectrum counts of the Aβ peptide in parenchymal plaques arteriolar and venular amyloid samples. Full size table

Several classes of proteins were identified in the amyloid samples (Supplementary Tables S1–S3) many previously reported within amyloid plaques3031. Protein classes included cytoskeletal proteins (tubulin actin and microtubule-associated proteins) and membrane trafficking-associated proteins (synaptosomal-associated proteins vesicle-associated membrane proteins dynein and clathrin). Among this class of proteins dynamin 1 was previously reported to be enriched in a mouse model of AD30 and AD patients31. Glial fibrillary acidic protein a specific marker for astrocytes was present in both parenchymal plaque and arteriolar amyloid samples (Supplementary Table S1 and S2). Since activated astrocytes are known to surround amyloid plaques and blood vessels32 the colocalization supports the integrity of the samples. Interestingly ApoE was present in the parenchymal plaque arteriolar and venular amyloid samples (Supplementary Tables S1–S3) which further supports the relationship between ApoE and AD69333435. Among the proteins identified exclusively in the venular amyloid sample collagen was identified specifically collagen α-1(I) (Supplementary Table S3). In summary tandem mass spectrometry analysis of the laser capture microdissection-derived amyloid samples identified a comprehensive list of proteins associated with parenchymal plaques arteriolar and venular amyloid (Supplementary Tables S1–S3).

Venular amyloid accumulation proceeds significant arteriolar amyloid deposition

To investigate the relationship between arteriolar and venular amyloid accumulation with disease progression vascular amyloid load was quantified as percent amyloid coverage of each vessel type (Fig. 3) and amyloid severity score (Fig. 4b c). Vascular amyloid has been demonstrated to be primarily in the cortex in the TgF344-AD at 9 months of age1. As such average percent amyloid coverage of each vessel was quantified by calculating the area of ThioS immunolabeling over the area of lectin labeling in the cortex specifically the cingulate motor and somatosensory cortices combined (Fig. 3). A significant age effect was observed for both arteriolar (Fig. 3a; p = 0.0001) and venular amyloid (Fig. 3b; p = 0.004); with significantly more arteriolar amyloid compared to venular amyloid at all ages (Fig. 3c; 7 months p = 0.0006 10 months p = 0.002 13 months p = 0.0008 16 months p = 0.002). The progression of amyloid across age varied where arteriolar amyloid coverage increased from 23.0 ± 3.1% to 31.4 ± 1.3% (mean ± sem p = 0.02) and venular amyloid coverage increased from 5.8 ± 2.0% to 14.1 ± 1.9% (p = 0.050) between 7 and 10 months of age. There were no significant differences in amyloid coverage between 10 and 16 months of age for both vessel types (Fig. 3a b). At 7 months the scatter plot shows high variability in arteriolar and venular amyloid coverage between animals within each cohort which decreases in arterioles relative to venules as amyloid accumulates (Fig. 3c). These data support previous literature demonstrating increase in CAA with disease progression23 as well as it suggests that venular amyloid accumulates in conjunction with severe arteriolar amyloid deposition and that arteriolar and venular amyloid may accumulate at different rates.

Figure 3 Percent arteriolar and venular amyloid load with disease progression. Percent vascular amyloid coverage was determined by quantifying area of ThioS over area of lectin-labelled vessels. Arteriolar (a; p = 0.0001) and venular amyloid (b; p = 0.004) increases significantly with disease progression. The majority of amyloid increased between 7 and 10 months of age for both arteriolar (p = 0.02) and venular amyloid (p = 0.05). Using two-tailed t-tests statistical approach the scatter plot comparing percent amyloid load between arterioles and venules (c) demonstrates significant arteriolar amyloid relative to venular amyloid within each individual rat: 7 (p = 0.006) 10 (p = 0.021) 13 (p = 0.0008) and 16 months of age (p = 0.019). Alpha = 0.05. Graphs are labelled as the mean of five replicates ± sem. (*p ≤ 0.05 **p ≤ 0.01 ***p ≤ 0.001 ****p < 0.0001). Full size image

Figure 4 Rate of vascular amyloidosis and severity in AD. A one-phase association model was utilized to compare the accumulation rate of arteriolar and venular amyloid with AD progression (a). Arteriolar amyloid (orange k = 0.4389) accumulated at a faster rate than venular amyloid (blue k = 0.3860). Vascular amyloid severity was categorized based on an established grade scoring system (0–4)36. There was a significant age effect for arteriolar (orange) (b) and venular (blue) (c) amyloid severity score in the cingulate motor and somatosensory cortices (p < 0.0001). Alpha = 0.05. The values of the bar graphs were labelled as the mean of five replicates ± sem. (*p ≤ 0.05 **p ≤ 0.01 ***p ≤ 0.001 ****p < 0.0001). Full size image

The rate of arteriolar and venular amyloid accumulation did not progress linearly as demonstrated by diminishing differences in arteriolar and venular amyloid coverage across age (Fig. 4a). A one-phase association curve was applied to describe the rate of accumulation and a significant difference was detected in arteriolar and venular amyloid accumulation rates (p < 0.0001). The k-value a constant represented as inverse time indicates the rate of arteriolar amyloid (k = 0.439) and venular amyloid (k = 0.386) accumulation (Fig. 4a). These values demonstrate that arteriolar amyloid accumulates faster than venular amyloid (Fig. 4a). The x-intercepts approximate the initiation of amyloid deposition for each vessel type and indicated that arteriolar amyloid initiated at ~ 4.5 months while venular amyloid was closer to 6 months of age (Fig. 4a). Overall the one-phase association model corroborated the histopathological analyses demonstrating that venular amyloid accumulates after and to a lesser extent than arteriolar amyloid accumulation. To further explore amyloid accumulation arteriolar and venular amyloid severity scores were analysed in three distinct areas of the cerebral cortex; the cingulate motor and somatosensory cortices (Fig. 4b c). This semi-quantitative tool allows for an accurate sampling as the analysis can be applied to the entire region of interest rather than an individual vessel-wise analyses. In addition the scoring system offers the ability to categorize vascular amyloid severity into five defined groups3637. All three brain regions accumulated amyloid with initial accumulation in the somatosensory cortex followed by the motor and finally the cingulate cortices (Fig. 4b c). Despite a non-significant difference in percent vascular amyloid coverage from 13 to 16-months of age in arteriolar and venular amyloid (Fig. 3a b) venular amyloid severity score demonstrated a statistically significant difference in the cingulate cortex (p = 0.005) and a positive trend toward significance in the motor (p = 0.05) and somatosensory cortices (p = 0.06).

According to a message on their Facebook page MacKenzie Pizza Pub and Grill made this announcement on Wednesday September 7th.

The popular restaurant has been serving Bismarck Mandan for nearly 10 years. In the message to their fans MacKenzie River Pizza Grill and Pub said they could no longer maintain the level of service to their customers because of the limited labor available in the Bismarck Mandan area (limited labor or is it the fact that nobody wants to work anymore?).

They went on to thank their loyal customers over the years and especially the ones who stuck with them during the pandemic.

MacKenzie River originally left this message on their Facebook page stating they would be closing temporarily while they gather and train a new staff. The post on Facebook certainly looked as though the restaurant would open again. This was posted on August 18th.

I guess the challenges of trying to find new employees were just too much. I've asked this question before and I'll say it again. ""What are people doing for money these days?"" Is everybody making their money from YouTube and TikTok videos?

One thing for sure I would be extremely leery of opening up a new restaurant or any business for that matter where you need employees these days. It's quite clear that nobody wants to work for their money anymore. Kind of a sad state of affairs.

Thieves ran off with $800000 worth of Nike shoes and clothing after ransacking 20 trailers according to the Memphis Police Department (MPD). Source: $800K of Nike shoes clothes stolen

A few years ago Nike began hiring Grey Market analysts. With the recent disclosure of a Nike VP’s son using his family relationship to build a booming resale business Nike has had to improve loss prevention and grey market strategies due to internal issues. Nike’s heart and soul sits in Memphis TN. Memphis is the distribution capital of the world. The city is the home of Fed Ex’s hub and Nike’s distribution as well as companies like TJX and even Louis Vuitton had a private warehouse in the city. The logistics of any major company probably runs through Memphis. Warehouses dominate the commercial property landscape and the city itself is dissected by railroad lines and highways with every lane filled by 18 wheelers.

Nike’s Consumer Direct Acceleration benefits greatly because of its location in Memphis. I discussed this in the post above. What does this have to do with the recent theft of Nike product which flooded StockX GOAT and eBay? There has been a considerable amount of misinformation around what took place. For years Nike has dealt with loss prevention issues but all retailers encounter these problems. Crimes are often inside jobs and a matter of opportunity. For Nike the ongoing problems with the supply chain reared its head in this recent theft. Typically Nike has been hit with smaller losses of 60 to 150K. This more ambitious theft happened not because Nike dropped the ball but due to overcrowded rail yards and privately owned storage yards. Nike was a double victim of the supply chain’s disruptions from China and Vietnam to the ports. There is so much excess product in transit Nike’s millions of square footage around their distribution centers are overwhelmed with containers. The brand utilizes an industry standard “empty swap” process of bringing in new containers and unloading that product then the trucker picks up an empty container. The backup of product in railyards led to the use of storage yards and the timing of the Labor Day holiday weekend provided an opportunity for this massive theft.

As the supply chain is still slow on the West Coast due to potential strikes because of unions preparing to fight for fairer wages and the East Coast and Southern ports now being congested topped off with more closures of facilities in Asia due to continued issues around Covid Nike is using overflow facilities. What does this mean and how does it counter the commentary about what happened? In sneaker media the word is Nike’s distribution centers were hit. This was not a Nike loss prevention issue directly. It’s an issue that will continue to happen as the West Coast ports are finally evening out but the East Coast and southern ports are facing the same issues:",,,,,,

The new location at 2 Newport Road in Dauphin County’s Reed Twp. near the intersection of routes 22 and 849 will bring their slow-smoked pulled pork and creamy mac and cheese to hungry new and returning customers.

Having started in 2019 with just a smoker and a tent outside a Howe Twp. store owners LauraMae Crist and Chris Clemmer have since opened a stand at 307 W. Juniata Parkway Millerstown that has been increasingly popular with barbecue fans from Perry County and beyond.

“People come from all over — Newville State College” Clemmer said. “Most days we sell out. Last year we sold out almost every day. We’re adjusting.”

According to Crist their venture started with Tractor Supply and “the farmers market they offered every Saturday until COVID hit when they shut down all events.”

It was thanks to a fan of their food Frank Campbell that they were able to continue operating. Campbell offered to let them set up their stand on his Millerstown lot. They opened in May 2021.

“LauraMae Chris and their family are down-to-earth hard-working people” Campbell said. “Along with serving great food when stopping there to eat it also is like visiting with friends. It’s a pleasure having them on-site.”

The secret ingredients in their barbecue are passion and experience. “It helps if you love to cook and people love to eat as well” Clemmer said with a laugh. “Newport Millerstown and the whole community has been great to us.”

“Chris got his love of smoking from his dad” Crist explained. Clemmer’s father was an engineer and a jazz musician and he frequently had large parties that Clemmer would help to cater. Originally from North Carolina the family moved to Texas for Clemmer’s father’s job. Having lived in two of the barbecue capitals of the South it’s no wonder Clemmer’s barbecue is so popular.

Every day they’re open LauraMae prepares pulled chicken pulled pork and their LauraMae burger which is a beef burger topped with pulled pork and coleslaw alongside their appetizing sides — ranch mushrooms macaroni and cheese coleslaw and baked beans. Their pork is smoked for 12 to 15 hours “low and slow” as Crist put it. They frequently rotate new items through their menu with smoked shaved ham making recurring appearances on Sundays and Thursdays.

LauraMae’s Smoked BBQ is operated by Clemmer and Crist with plenty of help from their children Michael Clemmer and Victoria Crist. Both stands are open Thursday through Saturday from 11 a.m. until 7 p.m. and on Sunday from 11 a.m. until 3 p.m. or until they sell out for the day.

Manuel Heredia Halcón's grandparents planted the olive trees in his 1200-acre grove in Andalusia Spain almost a century ago.

The trees are renowned for their ability to grow in even the driest of soils but this year scorching temperatures and a severe lack of rainfall have taken a toll.

""We are very concerned"" Halcón told CNN Business. ""You cannot replace the olive tree with any other tree or product"" he added.

Like many of Europe's farmers Halcón has battled extreme drought this summer — he estimates that the olive oil harvest from his farm Cortijo de Suerte Alta will fall by about 40% this year because of the extraordinary weather conditions.

In July temperatures broke records to top 40 degrees Celsius (104.5 degrees Fahrenheit) across parts of France Spain Italy and Portugal. By early August sweltering heat and a lack of rainfall had pushed almost two-thirds of land in the European Union into drought conditions according to the European Drought Observatory.

Olive oil producers have been hit hard. Kyle Holland a pricing analyst for oilseeds and grains at Mintec a commodities data company expects a ""dramatic reduction"" of between 33% and 38% in Spain's olive oil harvest that begins in October.

Spain is the world's biggest producer of olive oil accounting for more than two-fifths of global supply last year according to the International Olive Council. Greece Italy and Portugal are also major producers.

Consumers are already paying more for olive oil. Retail prices across the European Union shot up 14% in the year to July. But prices are set to rise further in the coming months producers and buyers told CNN Business.

""The drought is too significant. It's simply too dry. Some trees are producing very little fruit some trees are producing no fruit at all. This only happens when soil moisture levels are critically low"" Holland told CNN Business.

It is a warning shot for an industry reliant on a predictable life cycle for olive trees. Growers are accustomed to large swings in the harvest over a 24-month period but climate change is already disrupting that centuries-old rhythm.

‘Impossible to have fruit’

Producing olive oil is all about timing. The trees begin to bud in March before the flowers open in May. The olives grow over the summer months before harvest in the fall.

Andalusia Spain's southern-most region supplies about one third of the world's olive oil. It is used to temperatures regularly hitting 40 degrees Celsius but not in May when the flowers start to bloom.

""In that moment maybe we lost 15% to 20% of the harvest"" he said.

Halcón expects to sell this year's oil at €4 ($3.97) per kilo to his buyers including importers in Asia and America. That's an increase of 30% over the last year.

The heatwave coincided with a third consecutive year of little rainfall. Water levels in the Guadalquivir river which helps irrigate the surrounding olive groves are critically low. Halcón said he could only give his trees about half of the usual amount of water this growing season.

“Next year will be even worse because dams will be completely empty” he said.

Juan Jímenez CEO of the Green Gold Olive Oil Company a family business located about 160 kilometers (100 miles) to the northeast faces similar problems.

""[The issue] is not only about how hot it was but when it was hot"" he told CNN Business.

""In the moment when the flower of the olive comes to life and [if it is] hot the flower itself it burns so it's impossible to have a fruit"" he added.

Jímenez's olive trees cover 740 acres of mountainous and flat terrain. May's soaring temperatures will likely reduce his crop by between 35% and 60% of a normal year's harvest if rain doesn't fall within the next few weeks.

If so that would be the ""worst harvest in the last 10 years"" Jímenez said.

Elsewhere in southern Europe drought conditions have also caused huge headaches. Filippo Berio sells oil in 72 countries and sources most of it from suppliers in Italy Spain and Greece.

It also produces its own oil from 25000 trees in Italy. Walter Zanre managing director of Filippo Berio's UK division described the Tuscan grove as ""tinder-dry"" this summer. In late July a wildfire broke out very close to the company's only factory — where all of its oils are blended refined and bottled — engulfing it in smoke and ash.

""We've lived through drought situations but I think in living memory this is the worst that anyone's ever seen"" Zanre told CNN Business.

Price shock

Just how bad the 2022 harvest will be remains to be seen. The United States Department of Agriculture last month forecast a drop of 14% in global production while Mintec expects it could be similar to the 30%-plus loss projected for Spain.

Benchmark producer prices for Spanish extra virgin olive oil from Andalusia hit their highest level in over five years at the end of August. And in the past two years they have soared by almost 80% — from €2.19 ($2.18) per kilogram in August 2020 to €3.93 ($3.90) this month.

Prices spiked in early 2021 as buyers worried poor weather would crimp supply Mintec data shows. They shot up again in late February after Russia invaded Ukraine when a feared drop in sunflower oil exports from the region led buyers to stock up on olive oil as a substitute.

Since June signs that the next harvest will be poor have boosted prices again.

So far lengthy contracts between suppliers and retailers have shielded consumers from some of the worst price increases. But shoppers can expect a significant hike in the next four months when retailers renew their supply agreements Holland said.

""Retailers will try not to pass on as much of these costs as they can"" he said adding that producer prices could increase by as much as 15% above August's already inflated levels. Even a 10% rise would put producer prices at their highest ever level according to Mintec data.

Yacine Amor director at the Artisan Olive Oil Company a UK wholesaler told CNN Business that he expects the shelf price for a half-liter bottle (18 fluid ounces) of his olive oil to rise by as much as 20% over the next few months. Amor's customers are mostly supermarkets delis and restaurants.

The price of a bottle has already shot up in some major markets. In Europe the world's biggest consumer of olive oil the biggest rises were recorded in the Netherlands and Greece where retail prices jumped by more than a quarter in July compared to the same time the year before.

The same sized bottle of Filippo Berio extra virgin olive oil in the United Kingdom — the brand's biggest market outside of the United States — now costs a record £5 ($5.76) in some stores up from £3.75 ($4.32) at the start of the year. That's a third more expensive.

Zanre's biggest concern is how shoppers' behavior may change as prices inevitably rise.

""Without question we are facing one of the most difficult periods ever experienced in the olive oil industry"" he said.

Cost are rising everywhere

Olive oil producers have weathered plenty of storms in the past but this year a combination of extreme weather supply chain bottlenecks and soaring energy costs — stoked by the war in Ukraine — have caused an unprecedented squeeze.

Halcón said the cost of electricity needed to pump water to his trees has doubled while his glass bottles are 40% more expensive.

For Zanre too ""anything you touch in [the] supply chain"" has increased in price. He believes that some costs such as shipping fees are unlikely to ever come down.

""The pallet the goods move on have gone up the bottles have gone up the labels have gone up the caps have gone up the energy to run the factory has gone up. Everything. And then on top of that we have the price of [the] oil going up"" he said.

But crisis breeds opportunity Halcón said. Rising prices for seed oils including sunflower oil has made olive oil more competitive.

WINSTON-SALEM N.C. – The Carolina Cowboys delivered a performance that won’t soon be forgotten Saturday evening inside LJVM Coliseum in Winston-Salem North Carolina. Registering a walk-off win against the Arizona Ridge Riders the Cowboys overtook the No. 1 rank in the PBR (Professional Bull Riders) Team Series standings.

In a game that was decided by the final outs reigning PBR World Champion Daylon Swearingen (Piffard New York) delivered the go-ahead score as the Cowboys’ closer. His 87.75-point ride atop Jailhouse Cat (Clark View Farms/Phillips) not only earned his team their sixth-consecutive game win but also allowed them to leapfrog the Ridge Riders for the No. 1 position in the league.

Kansas City Outlaws: 171

Texas Rattlers: 167.5

Despite a late-game surge from the Texas Rattlers presented by Ariat the Kansas City Outlaws emerged supreme earning their second game win during PBR (Professional Bull Riders) Team Series event in Winston-Salem North Carolina 171-167.5.

After both teams failed to convert in the first the scoreboard underwent its first change in the second. Following a buckoff for the Rattlers from 2002 PBR World Champion Ednei Caminhas (Indaiatuba Brazil) the Outlaws were the first to strike when Marcus Mast (Middlebury Indiana) rode Red Scorpion (Mike Miller Bucking Bulls) for 85 points.

The Outlaws and Rattlers were then both blanked in the third however the game intensity ratcheted up in the fourth.

In the top of the frame Rafael Jose de Brito (Potirendaba Brazil) was awarded a re-ride after his trip with Codigo (Fabulous IV Ranch/Josh & Dalton Walling) was marked just 70.5 points. Opting to take the re-ride Cody Lambert elected to have Brady Fielder (Clermont Queensland) attempt the second-chance bull Oreo (Dustin Denning).

In the bottom of the fourth the Outlaws pulled ahead to 171 points as second-round draft pick Kyler Oliver (Roy Utah) rode Tiger (Blake Sharp/Henry Wilson) for 86 points.

As the fifth got underway the Rattlers were in a must-ride position needing scores from both their closer Junior Patrik Souza (Sonora Brazil) and re-ride rider Fielder to keep their hopes of victory alive. Rising to the occasion Souza covered Mongo (Flying C/Flying P Bucking Bulls) for 80.75 points to keep the Rattlers in contention for the win.

Before the Outlaws would attempt their final bull the Rattlers settled their unfinished business as Fielder climbed aboard re-ride bull Oreo. Needing in excess of 90.25 points to put his team in the lead while Fielder reached the whistle he was marked just 86.75 points handing the Outlaws the win.

With Kansas City’s final trip ending in a buckoff the final scoreboard read a 171-167.5 victory for the J.W. Hart-led team. The Kansas City Outlaws not only improved to a perfect 2-0 at PBR Cowboy Days inside LJVM Coliseum but also rose to 7-8 on the season.

Marking their second loss in Winston-Salem the Texas Rattlers are now 4-11 throughout the 2022 season.

During their final game in North Carolina the Outlaws will look to remain perfect when they take on the Oklahoma Freedom who are also undefeated while the Rattlers will seek their first victory of the event when they play the Missouri Thunder.

According to a message on their Facebook page MacKenzie Pizza Pub and Grill made this announcement on Wednesday September 7th.

The popular restaurant has been serving Bismarck Mandan for nearly 10 years. In the message to their fans MacKenzie River Pizza Grill and Pub said they could no longer maintain the level of service to their customers because of the limited labor available in the Bismarck Mandan area (limited labor or is it the fact that nobody wants to work anymore?).

They went on to thank their loyal customers over the years and especially the ones who stuck with them during the pandemic.

MacKenzie River originally left this message on their Facebook page stating they would be closing temporarily while they gather and train a new staff. The post on Facebook certainly looked as though the restaurant would open again. This was posted on August 18th.

I guess the challenges of trying to find new employees were just too much. I've asked this question before and I'll say it again. ""What are people doing for money these days?"" Is everybody making their money from YouTube and TikTok videos?

The app gives users a way to share photos and videos of their travels post about an upcoming trip arrange meetups with others and learn about new travel destinations.

What’s most notable is the Tinder-like feature in the “Discover” tab that allows users to vote on photos from people around the world by swiping left or right much like you do on matches.

After catching the travel bug 25-year-old Ethan Serbantes founded the startup to create a niche social platform where travelers could make connections and easily find new experiences.

Social media has transformed how we travel and millennials and Gen Zers consumed by wanderlust often go to Instagram for inspiration. Travel company Arrivia surveyed over 2000 Americans between December 2021 and January 2022 and found that 60% of Gen Zers and 40% of millennials use social media for vacation ideas for instance.

However browsing the internet for destinations can be time consuming the founder noted. While Instagram was where everyone was sharing vacation spots Serbantes said the locations he scrolled through on the platform didn’t have enough information for people who actually wanted to travel there. It also doesn’t help that you have to scroll past selfies and other posts that have nothing to do with the area.

Based on his own traveling experience Serbantes also realized that it can be hard to meet new people as a solo traveler. Travel booking platform Klook found that 49% of respondents were nervous about traveling solo because they didn’t want to be lonely in a foreign place.

With a team of six other people Serbantes designed OfftheGrid to “address the fragmented travel planning process and solo traveler problems” Serbantes told TechCrunch.

OfftheGrid aims to be a platform for travelers to connect with each other and share their experiences. Users can post their photos and videos on the main homepage of the app and see posts from travelers they follow.

Travello another social network app designed for travelers works similarly. However OfftheGrid has a swiping feature where users swipe left or right on a person’s post whether that’s a photo of a beach mountain or maybe a nice park. Users can like comment and favorite a photo to look at later by using the bookmark icon.

But there’s a catch: Once a user sees a photo of a place they’re interested in they need to have 10 in-app coins to reveal the information. For every swipe they gain one coin. Once unlocked there will be a description and a map where you can see where in the world the destination is.

There are also options to watch a video ad to earn the coins for free or buy coins. Users can pay $0.99 for 100 coins $1.99 for 300 coins and $4.99 for 600 coins.

The app’s “Trips” tab meanwhile allows users to meet up with other travelers. People post where they’re traveling and how long they’ll be there then others connect with them to offer any advice or arrange to meet. There’s a limit on how many people you can message per day. After chatting with three individuals the traveler has to again use coins to chat with additional people.

Of course it’s important that travelers stay safe when going to foreign places. While it can be fun to socialize with new people you also need to be wary of meeting up with strangers.

“Safety is a main priority of ours” Serbantes said.

For starters the app permits users to verify their email phone number and Facebook account. At launch OfftheGrid doesn’t have a system that verifies profile photos but Serbantes said the startup is working on implementing a photo identification API. OfftheGrid also plans on launching a blue checkmark system for verified profiles.

However as dating apps have shown what users really need are background checks — which is why Match Group began integrating the option this year into its apps like Tinder after horror stories of violence stalking and assault began to emerge from its users. OfftheGrid does not include such a feature so travelers will need to be careful of who they chat with and choose to meet.

OfftheGrid also has a “Explore” tab — a discovery tool for interacting with a map that has the most liked and trending content on the app. There’s a search option if users want to jump to a specific location and filters such as “Wildlife” “Parks/Trails” “Shopping” “Museums/Galleries” and “Food.”

OfftheGrid is a bootstrapped startup which means the company is self-funded and doesn’t rely on investors and external sources.

Serbantes said the company has a lot of plans for the app down the road. This includes a subscription model that allows subscribers to unlock photos and connect with as many people as they want. An organizational feature is in the works as well which lets users plan an itinerary based on photos they’ve liked on the app.

Another feature rolling out to the app is a “Locals” section within the “Trips” tab for users to find people within the area to reach out to.

Serbantes mentioned that in the future OfftheGrid would be hosting monthly photo competitions. The photos with the most likes are accurately geotagged will win. The details of what the prizes are have yet to be decided.

The travel app can be downloaded on the App Store and Google Play Store and is recommended for users 18 years old and up.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tY2tpbnNleS5jb20vaW5kdXN0cmllcy90cmF2ZWwtbG9naXN0aWNzLWFuZC1pbmZyYXN0cnVjdHVyZS9vdXItaW5zaWdodHMvYWlybGluZS1yZXRhaWxpbmctaG93LXBheW1lbnQtaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi1jYW4taW1wcm92ZS10aGUtYm90dG9tLWxpbmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airline retailing and distribution,"Airline retailing—essentially selling new products in new ways either directly to customers or via intermediaries—could be worth $40 billion by 2030. And payments as a critical link between airlines and their customers are a vital component of retailing. But if airlines are to realize the full value of retail it is imperative that they get payments right.

A new report Airline distribution and retailing: How payment innovation can help airlines improve customer experience and the bottom line highlights the relatively unexamined area of payments and how innovation in this area can help airlines to improve customer experience grow revenue and decrease costs.

Every year approximately 2.9 billion airline booking payment transactions take place across the world—valued at around $1 trillion. And while these payments represent valuable business transactions they come with a price. In fact the airline industry spends over $20 billion a year on payment costs. This amounts to around 3 percent of airlines’ total revenue and approximately 78 percent of the industry’s net profit. Payments also incur substantial short-term financing costs—$2 billion’s worth in 2019 representing 9 percent of airlines’ total payment costs.

Much of this expense is due to the high use of credit cards (around 70 percent of retail transactions) which while convenient for customers are costly for airlines.

On top of this airlines collect revenues on behalf of other participants in the value chain—such as airports and tax authorities—and forward around 10 percent of the total value of their transactions while still including payment costs for the total transaction value. Several stakeholders are involved in the payments value chain across both B2C and B2B payments. Each of these participants plays a different role and takes a different share of the payment fee value pool. Airlines are secondary beneficiaries in the value chain along with online travel agents (in the case of B2C payments from retail travelers) and travel management companies (for B2B or corporate transactions). The primary beneficiaries of the payment costs paid by airlines include payment issuers schemes gateway providers and payment acquirers.

Intermediaries such as booking platforms and online travel agencies have identified payments as one of their biggest opportunities for differentiation with some larger players already investing in fintech solutions to make the end-to-end payment journey seamless. Airlines can move strategically to improve payments to prevent further disintermediation and realize the value of airline retailing.

Payments represent a $14 billion opportunity

In addition to the $40 billion retailing opportunity airlines could potentially reap a further $14 billion in value through strategically addressing payments. This figure comprises revenue from payments ($8 billion) which could be generated by increasing sales of ancillary services enhancing loyalty programs and giving customers more flexible exchange and refund processes. A further $2 billion in value lies in reducing payment cost particularly for B2B or corporate sales while $4 billion could be generated through putting payment enablers in place to increase direct channel usage and improve payment conversion (Exhibit 1).

Payments are at the intersection of five key trends affecting the industry each of which provides opportunities for airlines to realize value.

First customer expectations are shifting. For instance retail customers have become comfortable making high-value transactions digitally while corporate travelers tend to value end-to-end solutions. Airlines can increase value for customers and meet their expectations by making the payment journey more convenient. Second while credit cards remain the most-preferred payment method alternative payments such as digital wallets or bank transfers are on the increase and airlines can test and onboard new payment methods to respond to this trend. Third innovations such as mobile point-of-sale devices can offer customers an improved payment experience while providing airlines with an opportunity to get to know their customers better through analyzing their data. Fourth support from various government initiatives is driving the emergence of alternative payment methods such as e-wallets and local debit cards and airlines could build operational models that are flexible and take local financial players and regulators into account. Finally the payment value chain is evolving toward a far more integrated and consolidated market opening opportunities for airlines to forge strategic payment partnerships and lower costs.

Payments have not yet been fully addressed by the industry

Despite the significant upside its associated cost and its general importance in the customer journey the area of payments as a strategic topic has often been unaddressed the industry. Generally there is little transparency or engagement with the topic and many airlines do not strategically monitor payment and transaction data and there is an absence of defined roles or KPIs in the area.

Payments are a significant element in the customer journey Payments are a critical link between airlines and their customers and an important part of the overall customer experience. There are up to ten touchpoints involving payments from booking to post-trip. Airlines could benefit from making the payment experience easier at each point these points leading to increased bookings and increased purchases of ancillary services (exhibit).

Furthermore many airlines have yet to leverage the link between payments and customer experience; these are often viewed as separate concerns. But payments are an important element of the customer journey—each touch point presents an opportunity to capture additional revenue (see sidebar “Payments are a significant element in the customer journey”).

Opportunities exist to increase revenues and lower costs

Payment methods can unlock revenue opportunities mainly from retail travelers while improvements in corporate travel payments could help to lower costs.

Opportunities exist for airlines to improve the retail customer payment experience particularly in direct channels to reduce dropouts. Airlines could also re-evaluate all the payment interactions throughout the customer journey make these easier and perhaps grow engagement and ancillary sales at these points. And as more consumers become comfortable with using alternative payment methods airlines can take steps to test and onboard new payment options too.

Corporate credit cards which are widely used for corporate travel are relatively more expensive for customers—and for airlines. But more cost-efficient corporate payment methods are available. For instance between 25 and 35 percent of corporates with external revenues greater than $300 million have implemented fully digital financial automation and B2B payments software and this is expected to increase over the next few years. Providing process efficiency can benefit all parties and lower airlines’ costs.

Airline bookings and transactions are largely digital so adopting account payable automation should be actionable for most companies. In addition there are already relevant providers operating in the market offering airlines the opportunity to adopt financial automation and B2B software.

Airlines could define differentiated strategies for retail travelers and corporates and ensure specific customer needs are satisfied for instance by leveraging different payments methods for each customer category or collaborating with local payment providers to define an operating model that best suits local customers.

The six secrets of profitable airlines

Realizing value through six key levers

Moving forward six value-creation levers could help airlines to seize the opportunity to capture the $14 billion payments opportunity and realize the $40 billion value of airline retailing. These levers may differ depending on the type of carrier as well as the regional and global scale of the business—there are likely to be bigger opportunities for individual airlines than for the overall industry. Airlines looking to realize the payment opportunity could consider taking the following actions:

Increase customer reach and conversion  by improving the user experience when it comes to booking through direct channels and improving payments conversion by minimizing technical issues. Airlines could also look to attract new customers especially in the growing customer segments of emerging markets.

Finally to help bring this journey to life and to make it sustainable the industry could consider developing a “reference blue-print” for payment. This could be the cornerstone for the planning of any airline that wants to embark on this journey of value creation and customer centricity through payment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvc3Rhci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xMTYzMTMxODIwL2NvbmZlcmVuY2VzLWdyb3VwLWV2ZW50cy1iZWNvbWUtbW9zdC1lc3NlbnRpYWwtdHlwZXMtb2YtYnVzaW5lc3MtdHJhdmVs0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Conferences Group Events Become Most Essential Types of Business Travel,"Well past the second anniversary of the pandemic business travel is finally starting to recover.

The timing of the recovery is perfect given that the school year has begun across most of the U.S. and the strong leisure demand of the past year is starting to wane as evidenced by softening weekend hotel occupancy. Business travel recovery is signaled by continued improvements in weekday hotel occupancy since the start of the year as well as signs of recovery in traditionally business-focused urban hotels.

STR’s consumer research conducted in late July 2022 produced telling insights into the state of business travel across the globe. When roughly 400 global business travelers were asked about the types of business travel they will undertake in the future group gatherings were perceived most positively.

Almost two-thirds of consumers registered positive plans saying they were as likely or more likely to travel compared with pre-COVID-19 for in-person group gatherings such as industry conferences (63%) or training and team-building events (61%). The increase in remote workers could be influencing this need for teams to gather and may become a more significant business travel segment in the future.

Individual face-to-face interactions — such as travel to meet with customers and visits to company headquarters — ranked second to group travel types with more than half of those surveyed planning to travel at the same or greater levels. Business travel for individual meetings with colleagues and suppliers/vendors rounded out the list with around half of respondents planning this type of travel at the same or greater levels compared with pre-pandemic times. Worker adaptation and use of video technology makes conducting these types of meetings an attractive alternative which may explain why the need to travel for these types of meetings is perceived least positively right now.

Digging Deeper

When business travelers were asked their interest in taking an overnight business trip in the next 12 months almost half responded positively. Of concern is the 40% who are not likely to undertake an overnight business trip. Because of the efficiencies and cost savings experienced by conducting business virtually during the pandemic there is some business travel that will never return.



However focusing on travelers who are “very likely” to travel for business in the next 12 months the types of business trips they will take increased across the board compared to the overall sample of business travelers. The chart below highlights this increase. One notable shift is the strength of face-to-face meetings with customers which moved up in intensity when compared to all business travelers. This is a possible sign that road warriors are indeed back.

Reality Check

While business travel is showing green shoots of hope the future is still unclear. The next six months will provide more clarity on the mix of post-pandemic business travel. Will the pent-up demand for in-person events and group meetings continue? Will remote workers unleash a new demand for training and team building events? As large corporations stabilize their corporate travel policies will road warriors return in full force? The answer to these questions presents the industry with both challenges and opportunities. The pandemic has disrupted traditional behaviors. This disruption provides hotels with opportunity to engage with travelers in perhaps previously unseen ways.

Here’s What to Expect,"Passengers wait in security lines at Miami International Airport after a storm resulted in delays. It is hoped that new initiatives by both the airlines and the government will help alleviate the chaos that has recently characterized air travel. Chandan Khanna/AFP via Getty Images

Cancellations. Lost luggage. Flight delays and endless waits for customer service. Even the official in charge of regulating civilian aviation in the United States hasn’t avoided the chaos. “Airlines need to step up their game” said Pete Buttigieg the U.S. transportation secretary who faced multiple cancellations and delays this summer. Still he’s optimistic that flying will improve this fall. “I do think that a better situation is within reach” he said.

Airline executives labor unions and industry analysts agree: Fall travel should be better than summer travel. They do not agree on how much better. But most concur that the issues that must be addressed include: not enough staff too many cancellations and delays problems with refunds and terrible customer service.

On the question of whether airlines have enough staff Airlines for America a trade organization representing seven major U.S. carriers says yes they do. “This summer carriers have proactively adjusted their staffing models to ensure they are adequately staffed for each flight” a spokeswoman wrote in an email.

Union leaders agree that staffing is adequate but only on “blue sky days” the term Gary Peterson the international vice president of the Transport Workers Union of America which represents more than 70000 airline workers uses for those 24-hour periods when nature works in airlines’ favor. “But when weather hits they don’t have enough reserves” he said.

“I believe airlines have taken steps to make things better but it’s fragile” said Sara Nelson the international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-C. W. A. the largest flight attendants’ union. Even before the pandemic staffing for roles ranging from pilot to wheelchair handler was stretched thin she said. In order to minimize the ripple effect when something goes wrong it’s critical to maintain staffing above the Federal Aviation Administration minimum she added something that has not happened for years.

A second concern: Have airlines stopped selling more flights than they can handle? Or will they continue with the pandemic trend of canceling flights that they should have never scheduled? Several analysts were optimistic that the airlines had learned from their mistakes. American Airlines for example recently slashed 16 percent of its November flights according to Cirium a travel analytics company. John Grant a senior analyst for OAG a travel data company noted that cancellation rates were far lower in July and August than earlier in the year. Still the delay rate has recently hovered around 23 percent higher than prepandemic times or last summer according to FlightAware a flight-tracking company.

The third issue: Will the refund flight change and hotel voucher process get easier? Mr. Buttigieg is pushing forward several initiatives. One involves updating a federal policy guiding flight refunds. Under the current policy airlines are supposed to reimburse passengers for flights that have been canceled or “significantly changed.” But carriers have long exploited ambiguity around the term. The proposal which he will revisit in November codifies the conditions under which refunds must be paid.

Last week the Department of Transportation launched a dashboard that Mr. Buttigieg called “a tool for transparency” outlining the services that each airline has committed to provide when flights are altered for reasons within their control.

Some analysts said that these measures are weak particularly in contrast with Europe where airlines must pay travelers — on top of refunds — for certain types of cancellations. Recently more than 30 state attorneys general blasted the Department of Transportation for failing to keep up with “escalating issues” and argued that they should take over enforcement of consumer protection laws affecting travelers. Some lawmakers have also suggested that airlines should be fined for treating passengers poorly given the billions of dollars in government pandemic aid they’ve received.

Finally there is the matter of customer service: Will Thanksgiving week be filled with nightmarish stories of unanswered calls to alter a flight or locate a lost bag? On this front labor representatives and industry analysts agree: It’s unlikely to get better soon. Airlines see customer service as an area to slash not grow costs. — Heather Murphy"

Yes except for 3 key areas says the CFO,"Good morning

“I’m optimistic about long-term technology trends” Dell Technologies CFO Tom Sweet told me. “You and I both know these days there isn’t less but more data getting created.”

I talked with Sweet in person yesterday about how the Fortune 50 multinational tech company is finding growth opportunities amid a macro environment and hiring adjustments. Dell based in Round Rock Texas recently reported Q2 revenue of $26.4B representing a 9% growth rate year over year driven by growth across the Client Solutions Group and Infrastructure Solutions Group beating diluted EPS estimates.

In 2021 more remote work meant more demand for Dell’s desktops and laptops. But “coming into this year we talked about how the PC demand environment would be a bit softer” Sweet explains. “And the infrastructure business (servers and storage) would be a bit stronger” he says. “So far that’s played out.” The company continues to “invest in strategic growth areas like telecom and multi-cloud solution capabilities that we’re building out” Sweet says.

‘Counter-cyclical opportunities’

“Now obviously the client space is a little softer than what we had thought given the global economic dynamics that are going on” he says.

So I asked Sweet how Dell plans to keep its momentum amid high inflation rising interest rates and consumers being pinched.

“In times like these you tend to look for counter-cyclical opportunities” he explains. “Think about what industry verticals are growing right now—the energy industry health care defense and government spending. These are areas where you’ve got to take advantage of the opportunities.”

Another focus area is “making sure that our pricing strategies are appropriate for the market” Sweet says. “Fifty percent of Dell’s revenue comes internationally and currency fluctuation has been pretty significant” he says. “Our selling prices are generally local currency.” As the dollar has strengthened adjusting pricing “has been a careful balancing act” Sweet says.

Areas where Dell’s still hiring

In regard to cost control actions “In early June we decided to pause external hiring except for a few strategic areas just to be prudent as we try to think through ‘What does the back half of the year look like?’”

Sweet named the strategic areas:

– Dell’s still hiring for its telecom business which is focused on the 5G rollout and helping providers put modern infrastructure into their networks he says.

– “From a finance perspective there are certain things that are not voluntary” Sweet explains. “You’ve got to have the right statutory and tax reporting. In those areas we’re hiring as well.”

– Dell’s leadership team is also focused on developing young talent. “We continue to invest and hire in the undergraduate space” Sweet says. “We wanted to ensure our entry-level programs into Dell and our campus-level programs continue. We think the right thing to do over the long term is bringing that talent in right out of school and develop them internally versus trying to go out and hire talent away from other companies.”

Speaking of talent in a LinkedIn post on Wednesday titled “Culture is Key to Hybrid Work” Michael Dell CEO of the company weighed in on the ongoing return to work debate. “From my experience if you are counting on forced hours spent in a traditional office to create collaboration and provide a feeling of belonging within your organization you’re doing it wrong” Dell writes. “Technology’s ability to create a do-anything-from-anywhere world also enables you to create a strong corporate culture anywhere all the time.” When it comes to hybrid work the company has empowered its managers who have teams distributed around the globe to talk with team members to decide what works best Sweet says.

Before we wrapped up our conversation I asked him what he does during his downtime when he’s not in the office strategizing. “I’m a big family guy” Sweet told me. He and his wife hang out with their five grandkids he says. And he’s into sports. “I grew up in Michigan” Sweet says. “So I’m a long-suffering Detroit Tigers and Detroit Lions fan.”

Have a good weekend. Take care.

Big deal

A new Gallup report finds that ""quiet quitters"" make up at least 50% of the U.S. workforce and the trend could get worse. Gallup defines quiet quitters as employees who do the minimum required and are psychologically detached from their job. During the second quarter of 2022 U.S. employee engagement took another step backward with the proportion of engaged workers remaining at 32% but the proportion of actively disengaged increasing to 18% the report found. ""The ratio of engaged to actively disengaged employees is now 1.8 to 1 the lowest in almost a decade"" according to Gallup. The findings are based on a random sample of 15091 full- and part-time U.S. employees aged 18 and over surveyed in June of 2022.

“The Fed has the responsibility for price stability by which we mean 2% inflation over time. The longer inflation remains well above target the greater the risk the public does begin to see higher inflation as the norm and that has the capacity to raise the costs of getting inflation down.”

Eating protein is key to a healthy diet and Tyson Foods is making sure more consumers have access to the category. The supplier is teaming up with Feeding America® member food banks to address food insecurity with a $2.5 million donation. During September which is Hunger Action Month® Tyson is also donating 2.5 million lbs of protein the equivalent of 10 million meals.

“Tyson has been a long-time partner of Feeding America as their mission to improve access to nutritious food for all is aligned with our mission to Feed the World. This partnership with Feeding America to expand capacity and help rural communities and communities of color is the next step in our evolving strategic partnership” said Tim Grailer Senior Director Tyson Foods. “With inflation putting pressures on the charitable food system both increasing their costs and the need for their services there has never been a more important time to support these efforts.”

According to a press release Tyson Foods will allocate $1 million of its donation to support Equitable Food Access grants which aim to improve access to nutritious food among people experiencing the highest rates of food insecurity with a focus on communities of color and/or people living in rural communities.

The remainder of the donation will go toward expanding capacity to repack bulk or private label protein products into family-size quantities thus increasing the types of protein that can easily be donated and distributed.

“While hunger exists in every county across the country it impacts each community in vastly different ways requiring thoughtful and strategic solutions” said Erika Thiem Chief Supply Chain Officer Feeding America. “One in eight people including one in six children in America are food insecure. As food banks continue to face increasing demand we're thankful for partners like Tyson whose ongoing food and fund donations are supporting our network’s efforts to increase access to protein a high-need item and ensure equitable access to food for communities facing hunger.”

FAYETTEVILLE N.C. (WTVD) -- One in six military families is food insecure according to a national survey conducted by the Military Family Advisory Network (MFAN). That is why the organization is hosting a food distribution event in Fayetteville on Saturday September 10 from 9 am to 1 pm.

The food giveaway comes just in time for Hunger Action Month a time in which advocates raise awareness about poverty and other issues causing hunger.

Eight hundred families are expected to come to Manna Church on Cliffdale Road for food and supplies and another 150 families are on the waitlist. According to organizers that's an indicator of how broadly food insecurity is harming families in the area.

""When you're hungry you're not able to function"" said Derek Doyle the Associate Director of Government and Public Affairs of MFAN. ""You're not able to excel in school excel in the workplace. So there are definitely second and third order effects that come along with food insecurity.""

This is the fourth food distribution event MFAN has held with Manna Church since June 2021. Doyle explained hardships that come along with military life such as frequently having to move and often living on just one income for the whole family are usually the reasons why people go hungry. He said the food being given away is a crucial lifeline for vulnerable families as it helps them function in everyday life.

""Each one that's going to come through tomorrow is going to receive over 50 pounds of frozen protein seasonal produce and household items all at no cost. So this is the equivalent of $200 to $300 worth of groceries that's going to make their life a little bit easier for a month"" Doyle said.

""Sometimes we do need help"" said Jordan Gill Admissions and Outreach Director of Manna Church. ""And especially in our current economic climate with inflation and gas and food prices being what they are I think it is harder now than it has been in a long time to get some of these items that normally were easier. So it's okay to look for avenues and organizations that are there to help you out.""

CVS Health and Tyson Foods are also partners in the drive-through event. It's part of MFAN's Combat Military Hunger initiative a nationwide effort to mitigate food insecurity in military and veteran populations. Doyle said he is proud of his team's accomplishments in serving communities. Well over one million meals have reached more than 10000 families but he hopes they can soon stop fighting this battle.

""The dream is to not have to organize events like this for our families so they don't have to rely on non-profits to ensure that there's food on the table for families"" Doyle said.

Manna Church said families shouldn't be discouraged if they can't make it to the food distribution event. Those looking for support can come to the Manna Dream Center in Downtown Fayetteville on Raye Avenue all year long.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9ob3JtZWwtZm9vZHMtY29ycC1zdG9jay1yaXNlcy1mcmlkYXktc3RpbGwtdW5kZXJwZXJmb3Jtcy1tYXJrZXQtMDE2NjI3NTcwOTktYTNlMTVlZDg5ZWM00gGCAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9hbXAvZGF0YS1uZXdzL2hvcm1lbC1mb29kcy1jb3JwLXN0b2NrLXJpc2VzLWZyaWRheS1zdGlsbC11bmRlcnBlcmZvcm1zLW1hcmtldC0wMTY2Mjc1NzA5OS1hM2UxNWVkODllYzQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hormel Foods Corp. stock rises Friday still underperforms market,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/hormel-foods-corp-stock-rises-friday-still-underperforms-market-01662757099-a3e15ed89ec4 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9ob3JtZWwtZm9vZHMtY29ycC1zdG9jay1yaXNlcy1mcmlkYXktc3RpbGwtdW5kZXJwZXJmb3Jtcy1tYXJrZXQtMDE2NjI3NTcwOTktYTNlMTVlZDg5ZWM00gGCAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9hbXAvZGF0YS1uZXdzL2hvcm1lbC1mb29kcy1jb3JwLXN0b2NrLXJpc2VzLWZyaWRheS1zdGlsbC11bmRlcnBlcmZvcm1zLW1hcmtldC0wMTY2Mjc1NzA5OS1hM2UxNWVkODllYzQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd2h5eS5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZXMvZW52aXJvbm1lbnRhbGlzdHMtZGVjcnktbmF0dXJhbC1nYXMtdGVybWluYWwtc291dGgtamVyc2V5L9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vd2h5eS5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZXMvZW52aXJvbm1lbnRhbGlzdHMtZGVjcnktbmF0dXJhbC1nYXMtdGVybWluYWwtc291dGgtamVyc2V5L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Environmentalists decry permit extension approval for natural gas terminal in South Jersey,"The Delaware River Basin Commission on Thursday approved a three-year permit extension for a controversial project to build New Jersey’s first terminal for exporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) along the Delaware River.

The extended permit gives Delaware River Partners an affiliate of New Fortress Energy until June 2025 to build a dock on the Delaware River in Gibbstown Gloucester County.

The terminal project which involves dredging a portion of the Delaware River will enable the company to transport LNG by truck and/or rail along the Delaware River from Pennsylvania’s Marcellus Shale to Gibbstown and export gas overseas. Delaware River Partners is still seeking approval from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration to extend a separate permit that allows them to transport LNG by rail.

The building of an LNG terminal in South Jersey has sparked concern from environmental and civic groups and residents who say exporting LNG would pollute the air and water and could destroy homes in the event of an explosion.

More than 100000 signatures against the project have been submitted to the DRBC according to the environmental advocacy group Delaware Riverkeeper Network. The group appealed the project in 2019 but DRBC commissioners gave the project final approval in December 2020. Following a second DRN appeal the case is now in federal court awaiting a ruling.

The commission’s executive director Steve Tambini already approved extending Delaware River Partners’ expired permit in June. Delaware Riverkeeper Network Deputy Director Tracy Carluccio said her group only discovered the permit extension approval after filing a public records request. After objections from DRN Tambini sought a final decision from the commissioners on Thursday.

Four commissioners voted in favor of the permit extension with New York state abstaining. The DRBC oversees water use and quality in the Delaware watershed including ensuring there’s enough clean drinking water for more than 15 million people in Delaware New Jersey New York and Pennsylvania. The agency is made up of the governors of those four states and the commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ North Atlantic Division who represents the federal government.

Carluccio argues that permits can only be extended if substantial funds have been expended on a project. Delaware River Partners has spent at least $1.8 million of the estimated price tag of $113 million. Carluccio also said the public was not given the opportunity to provide comments.

“It is no way to run an agency to have the public find out about an extension of a permit — particularly for a project as controversial and publicly opposed as the Gibbstown LNG export terminal is — through the freedom of information request” Carluccio said. “The public has the right to know about the projects and has the right to have input on the projects that will impact their lives and this one will.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzEwL21ha2UtbGVhcm5pbmctYS1uZXctbGFuZ3VhZ2UtYS1icmVlemUtd2l0aC1iYWJiZWwtZm9yLTE5OS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Make learning a new language a breeze with Babbel for $199,"Discover startups services products and more from our partner StackCommerce.

The agency said banks reported $64.4 billion in profits as higher net interest income offset growing reserves to guard against loan losses. Profits were down $6.0 billion or 8.5% from a year ago.

The growth in profits came as interest rates rose and banks expanded their loan balances. Total loan balances increased $414 billion or 3.7% from the previous quarter.

In a statement acting FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg said the results were generally positive but warned the banking industry continues to face significant downside risks from high inflation rapidly rising interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty. ""Taken together these risks may reduce profitability weaken credit quality and capital and limit loan growth in coming quarters” he said.

The FDIC said that the rate of non-current loans that are 90 days or more past due had fallen to 0.75% the lowest level since 2006. Bank deposits which had surged during the pandemic fell 1.9% in the second quarter — the first decline in four years.

The FDIC also reported that bank merger activity continued in the second quarter with 28 institutions merging while no banks failed in the second quarter of 2022.

""U.S. banks are in much better shape than they were in prior economic slowdowns and should benefit from rising interest rates as long as the economy doesn't tumble into a deep recession. Investors are showing more confidence in the banking sector than they are in the broader market as seen through the slight outperformance of the XLF ETF which tracks the financial sector compared to SPY the SPDR S&P 500 Trust"" said Caleb Silver Editor-in-Chief of Investopedia.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zcGdsb2JhbC5jb20vbWFya2V0aW50ZWxsaWdlbmNlL2VuL25ld3MtaW5zaWdodHMvbGF0ZXN0LW5ld3MtaGVhZGxpbmVzL2NyaXRpY2l6ZWQtbG9hbnMtbGVhZGluZy1pbmRpY2F0b3Itb2YtY3JlZGl0LXN0cmVzcy1rZWVwLWZhbGxpbmctNzE5Nzg4NDXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Criticized loans leading indicator of credit stress keep falling,"The U.S. banking industry's early warning indicator for credit stress continued to signal improvement in the second quarter.

Criticized loans fell quarter over quarter at 20 of the 28 U.S. banks with more than $50 billion of assets for which values are available according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The drop extended a consistent decline in criticized loans across large banks following a pandemic-induced surge that peaked in 2020 and pushed the median ratio of criticized loans to Tier 1 capital to below levels seen in 2016 and 2017.

Criticized loans are regarded as a leading indicator of credit trends because they include commercial loans that banks flag as having an elevated risk of default per their internal ratings as well as loans that have already missed payments. The data aligns with reports from banks that have said they have not yet seen many concrete signs of credit deterioration despite a slowdown in economic activity and fears that higher interest rates could trigger a severe downturn.

Still banks have been tightening loan standards and executives say they are keeping a particularly close eye on areas like offices and health care properties. Analysts anticipate that higher interest rates alone will prompt some business defaults.

M&A-related increases

Among the eight banks that reported higher levels of criticized loans three completed major acquisitions during the second quarter. M&T Bank Corp. said its increase was driven by its purchase of People's United Financial Inc. while Citizens Financial Group Inc. said its was driven by its deal for Investors Bancorp Inc.

M&T said its criticized portfolio reflects ongoing damage from the pandemic with about 58% of its criticized loans in the investor-owned commercial real estate sector. The bank also said some commercial borrowers have been pressured by an inability to pass on rising prices to customers although it maintained its guidance for a net charge-off rate in the 20-basis-point range this year.

""I wouldn't give the all-clear signal. That would be very un-M&T like"" CFO Darren King said on an earnings call. ""But there's nothing that's flashing red right now that says that there's a big crisis coming in the next several quarters.""

Bank of America Corp. reported declines in criticized loans for the quarter and the first half of the year despite downgrades of its Russia exposure. The bank said the declines were ""broad-based across industries.""

Recovery to pre-pandemic levels

Across the 100 biggest publicly traded banks in the U.S. aggregate criticized loans have fallen 31.1% to $156.16 billion in the second quarter of 2022 from $226.71 billion at the end of 2020. The second-quarter total remains above a 2016 to 2019 pre-pandemic range of $106.37 billion to $122.99 billion but bank loan portfolios have grown substantially since then.

The median ratio of criticized loans to Tier 1 capital has fallen to 17.6% from 30.3% at the end of 2020. That is below the middle of the range of 16.8% to 19.4% from 2016 to 2019.

Early warning signals are a bit less reassuring elsewhere but are not signaling any major imminent problems. The credit spread for the ICE BofA US High Yield Index which can serve as a proxy for market sentiment on commercial bank loans reached almost 6% in early July though the spread entered September at about 5%. That compares with a peak of nearly 11% early in the pandemic and a peak of nearly 9% during a rough patch in the economy in 2016.

Leveraged debt analysts at BofA Global Research said they expect defaults to rise over the next two to three years but borrowers are entering the cycle in a relatively stronger position after refinancing into higher levels of fixed-rate debt.

""We do not anticipate an aggressive default cycle"" they said in an Aug. 29 note.

The firm topped the polls across a six categories marking one of the most commanding performances from a single banking institution.

Commitment to Commodities

Bank of America’s strategic initiative to stay invested in commodities through a down cycle when many other firms exited the space has paid off over the last two years. From the pandemic-induced slump in demand through to the inflationary spike and soaring energy prices market participants that abandoned hedges during the stable years of the 2010s have found themselves in serious need of help.

“Commodities is a core risk management tool inside the bank and we’ve seen a significant increase in the number of clients coming to us for bespoke solutions” says Tom Blair global head of commodity sales and co-head of global markets investable indices sales. “We’re very much a solution-oriented business and everything is about helping our clients manage the inherent commodity risk of their portfolio.”

Being at the vanguard is where you can really differentiate yourself and so we’re always trying to innovate Tom Blair global head of commodity sales and co-head of global markets investable indices sales.

The bank’s client base spans institutions and corporates managing portfolio risk through to major producers and consumers. Bank of America attracts such a loyal diverse client base in part for its commitment to commodities but also through a focus on innovation and anticipation. The firm has positioned itself at the forefront of the energy transition long recognising that the shift to renewables and green energy would transform clients’ needs. “Being at the vanguard is where you can really differentiate yourself and so we’re always trying to innovate” says Blair.

IR market share ramps up

The bank’s interest rate derivatives operation saw very large increases in market share with several large real money clients in interest rate swaps and options. This complemented the existing strength with hedge funds and corporates to result in large market share increases in the products overall. They also prioritised conversations with dozens of commercial banking clients encouraging them to hedge interest rate exposure given the likelihood of higher rates. “Conversations with clients and businesses all across the country gave the team good insight into the inflation dynamics that were evolving” said Kavi Gupta the bank’s co-head of global rates. “Bank of America is uniquely positioned given our footprint and incredible market share with commercial banking clients.”

Bank of America also distinguished itself in being highly active when it comes to helping clients through the benchmark transition. “We were the first to provide liquidity in SOFR at the same bid-offer spread as LIBOR on day one when dealers migrated” says Gupta. “BofA pioneered that and it helped participants across the market get comfortable with the SOFR product very quickly.” Similarly the firm stands out from a thought leadership standpoint with representatives on the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) working on a variety of different issues including the term rates proposal and credit spread component and SOFR based on nonlinear products for end users.

“Given our scale what’s come together for us is consistency from a sales standpoint a passion for helping clients and franchise growth” says Gupta. “The desk is really focused on printing customer business and growing market share and that’s helped us in a lot of ways.”

Equity excels on innovation

On equities the last few years have seen the bank better align its derivative sales and trading business. Combined with an existing customer-oriented culture this put the bank in an excellent position to handle the rise in volatility. “We've built this platform where we can weather all storms” says Tim Whiteley head of Americas equity derivative sales. “I think that rests on the responsible growth model that CEO Brian Moynihan has instilled in the firm.”

Being part of BofA allows us to lean on our teammates across products solutions and as needed toward our balance sheet in a way that really helps clients especially in times of stress and in volatility Tim Whiteley head of Americas equity derivative sales

But this responsibility goes hand-in-hand with innovation. The bank had a record breaking year for patents in 2021 with more than 512 granted. Whiteley points to several years of work that recently culminated in a new patent for the bank which he describes as the first intraday volatility control technology for the fixed index annuity market.

“That says a lot about what's going on in terms of innovation and how we're growing as a firm and as a franchise’' he adds. “The big growth for us is in the structured space. We're a bank with a broker dealer. Being part of BofA allows us to lean on our teammates across products solutions and as needed toward our balance sheet in a way that really helps clients especially in times of stress and in volatility.”

FX soars post-merger

The transformation in the FX derivatives operations has been even more stark. In the last two years the bank has combined its emerging market and FX businesses. This has created a trading operation with a flexible sophisticated skill set ideal for handling everything from peso volatility to pound sterling behaving like an emerging market currency. But the team also created a dedicated initiative to become a major player in the FX space.

“We called it Back to Top and the aim was to be in the top three with every counterparty in every sector in every currency” says Carlos Fernandez-Aller head of global foreign exchange and emerging markets macro trading. This led to a 36% increase in volumes over the last two years - more than three times the increase in the wider market. Part of this stellar growth came from a focus on under-served clients - notably hedge funds and real money. “We hired a group of new salespeople to make sure we increased our presence” he says. “I’m confident if you asked those clients which is the most improved bank our name would come up pretty often.”

Against the backdrop of the merger and the hiring spree Fernandez-Aller has also overseen a shift in the approach to risk appetite. This was exemplified by the bank’s expansion in 2021 into a new product - “FX deal-contingent” - which the bank had previously left to rivals. “We wanted to find a compromise and a balance in risk taking and this is an example of that” he says. “It took a lot of discussion about how to minimise risk but FX deal-contingents now account for a significant portion of the business.”

A unique perspective

Bank of America’s derivatives research team stood out for its collective experience a unique focus on cross-asset volatility and its ability to provide macro and micro perspectives on key challenges.

“We’re able to start with describing the high-level issues that almost all clients are facing - these highly unusual market trends of the last two years that haven’t been seen in decades” says Ben Bowler head of global equity derivatives research. “We can pinpoint the challenges investors will face but then drill all the way down into real solutions.”

That focus on finding value across asset classes - equities rates commodities credit - in a volatile market that’s something unique to our approach Ben Bowler head of global equity derivatives research

The team spends a huge amount of time providing answers to the difficult questions facing market participants. This encompasses not just the more common tools around efficient hedging solutions fixed income challenges and optimal diversification. But also the more fundamental challenges such as the increasing frequency of rare events and end of the Fed-put era. The team’s search for optimal solutions is aided by its flagship global financial stress indicator tool which provides risk measurement and monitoring across a total of 43 factors covering five asset classes.

“That focus on finding value across asset classes - equities rates commodities credit - in a volatile market that’s something unique to our approach” says Bowler. “There are not many houses that combine a unique perspective on macro issues cross asset volatility and then follow that all the way down to a specific solution that helps clients efficiently mitigate the risk of these formidable threats.”"

After a period in which waits for an Uber ride grew longer due to a driver shortage the partnership will boost the number of rides available and it gives NYC cab drivers access to a massive pool of commuters with an Uber app on their phones.

There had been hints that tensions between Uber and taxi services had begun to thaw as Uber expanded aggressively into the very lucrative food delivery business and needed a growing supply of delivery drivers.

During the pandemic Uber's food deliveries outpaced rides given to humans as millions sheltered at home. Gross bookings for delivery services at Uber reached $13.4 billion in the final quarter of 2021. That's compared with $11.3 billion in gross bookings for Uber rides.

The agreement comes amid the backdrop of more cities moving to regulate the explosive growth of Uber and other app-based ride services including New York City which placed a temporary cap on new licenses for ride-hailing services in 2018.

New York City is the largest American market for Uber.

The New York City Workers Alliance a group that represents taxi drivers and has been critical of Uber and other ride-hailing apps said it would push for negotiations.

“After its business model has shown the failures to protect drivers from ridership downturns and rising gas prices Uber is returning to its roots: yellow cabs” Bhairavi Desai the executive director of the NYCWA said in a prepared statement back in March.

Uber Technologies Inc. has been incorporating taxi drivers around the world into its system for the past several years. In Spain the company has integrated taxis Madrid Málaga Valencia and Barcelona.

It teamed in Colombia with TaxExpress which has more than 2300 active drivers. Half of all Uber taxi trips in Latin America come from the TaxExpress partnership in Colombia. Uber also has relationships with taxi software and fleet operators in Austria Germany Turkey South Korea and Hong Kong.

Anyone with the Uber app will have access to thousands of yellow taxis that operate on the CMT/Arro platform. Taxi drivers will see Uber-originated fares on their driver monitors which they already use to service e-hails from the Arro taxi app.

“Uber has a long history of partnering with the taxi industry to provide drivers with more ways to earn and riders with another transportation option. Our partnerships with taxis look different around the world and we’re excited to team up with taxi software companies CMT and Curb which will benefit taxi drivers and all New Yorkers” Andrew Macdonald senior vice president Mobility and Business Operations at Uber said in a prepared statement.

Creative Mobile Technologies said that taxi drivers on its platform which includes the taxi app Arro will gain access to Uber’s customer base giving them the opportunity for a higher volume of trips and expanded revenue.

Creative Mobile said a beta version for taxis will be rolled out this spring and reach the general public this summer.

Curb which offers a ride-hailing app for licensed taxi and for-hire rides in North America said the new agreement with Uber will start in New York City.

Drivers on the Curb platform will be able to receive and accept Uber trip offers through their existing in-vehicle systems in addition to Curb app demand and traditional street hails.

“We’ve found great success in creating incremental trip demand and revenue for drivers by integrating with several aggregators over the past two years and this partnership builds on that success by delivering even greater opportunities for cab drivers to have access to an ever-widening pool of riders” Curb CEO Amos Tamam said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2Jvc3Rvbi9uZXdzL3ViZXItZHJpdmVyLXJlc2N1ZXMtd29tYW4tY2hpbGQtZnJvbS1maWVyeS1jcmFzaC1yZXZlcmUv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL2Jvc3Rvbi9uZXdzL3ViZXItZHJpdmVyLXJlc2N1ZXMtd29tYW4tY2hpbGQtZnJvbS1maWVyeS1jcmFzaC1yZXZlcmUv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber driver rescues woman child from fiery crash in Revere,"By Mike Sullivan WBZ-TV

REVERE -- An Uber driver comes to the rescue in Revere. The good Samaritan jumped into action to save a woman from a burning car.

""That is part of me as a human being. It is our job to save lives you know?"" tells Uber driver Mohamed Sanusie Traore.

He was traveling along Squire Road on his way to the airport when he watched a car flip onto its side. The Uber driver pulled over and rushed to the scene. He heard a woman screaming for help. She was trying to open her door but the weight was too much.

As he lifted the door for her he realized the woman's young daughter was trying to escape first. He called for additional help but no one came.

""I had to do it by myself so I used my right hand to lift the door with all my might and pull the baby out with my left hand"" details Traore.

Moments after the three got away the car exploded into flames.

""Less than one minute smoke started come from the vehicle and then fire. The engine is on and liquid is coming out so I sense danger"" adds Traore.

He still has sore arm from the rescue and is seeing a doctor but Traore says he would do what he did again.

""Life is the only gift that once it is taken away you can never have it again"" continued Traore. ""I'm a Muslim. If you save one life it's like you have saved every human being's life.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdXJ0aG91c2VuZXdzLmNvbS91YmVycy1wbGFuLXRvLWRpc2d1aXNlLWhhY2stdGhyb3VnaC1idWctYm91bnR5LXByb2dyYW0tc2NydXRpbml6ZWQtYXQtdHJpYWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber's plan to disguise hack through bug bounty program scrutinized at trial,"Former Uber engineers testified Friday about their qualms regarding a plan to convert two malicious hackers to white-hats to resolve a 2016 data breach. Their former boss is now on trial for covering up the cyberattack.

SAN FRANCISCO (CN) — When Uber’s former security head Joe Sullivan first raised the idea of treating a serious 2016 data breach as a “bug bounty” software engineer Daniel Borges thought it was a neat idea.

""It struck me as novel idea and very neat” said Borges who was part of Uber’s security response team tasked with triaging a serious intrusion caused by two hackers who downloaded a trove of personal data from 57 million riders and drivers after breaching one of the company's Amazon-hosted web servers. “It thought it was a creative way to solve the problem.”

The former Uber engineer testified Friday in Sullivan’s trial where he stands accused of concealing the breach from authorities and obstructing an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission into Uber’s security practices.

The investigation was prompted by a similar security incident from 2014 and prosecutors say Sullivan covered up the 2016 breach to avoid further FTC scrutiny by paying for the hackers’ silence with $100000 and disguising the hack as another white hat bounty.

Many tech companies offer deals for researchers to find and report security flaws in exchange for a potential payout. Uber’s own bug bounty program created in partnership with HackerOne debuted publicly in March 2016.

Borges testified that he soon began to have second thoughts about convincing the hackers to join the program. “As I thought about it more and I started to look at the data I started to have a nagging feeling like is this a breach? Should we say something?” he said.

John “Four” Flynn an information security officer who reported to Sullivan also testified that he recalled being in the room when a bounty was discussed though as one of the leaders of the response team his central focus at the time was in “locking the system down.”

""My view evolved but in the beginning we wanted to get them to operate within the program because that was the system we had set up for these sorts of things” Flynn said. “That's what it was built for for people to find security issues and report them to us.”

But the hackers’ methods were dubious and their demands struck him as extortionate. He noted that the first hacker reached out to Sullivan’s personal email instead of through the HackerOne portal which would have required an account set up with a Social Security number.

In subsequent emails with members of Uber's security response team the hackers demanded “six figures” and threatened to expose the personal data they’d stolen if they weren’t handsomely paid.

“They made extortionate demands and made threatening notices to us so it was clear they didn't want operate in the way the program was set up” Flynn said. “The amount of money they were demanding was much higher than we would normally pay out for security flaws in the program. The point of the program is to find technical flaws not exploit them and take advantage of them.”

Borges echoed Flynn’s account saying the incident “seemed unusual” in the context of a bug bounty since Uber usually controls the size of the payout. “The hacker went to Joe and said ‘Hey I have your data and I want this amount of money. It was 10 times higher than our maximum payout.”

Borges noted his concerns about disclosure obligations in the company’s “Preacher Central Tracker” a real-time digital record of Uber’s response to the attack. “Not at this time"" was the response he received.

Sullivan’s trial is believed to be the first criminal prosecution of a tech executive over a data breach and the Wall Street Journal reported that its outcome is being closely watched by other tech company security chiefs who believe Sullivan's handling of the attack was appropriate.

Sullivan a highly regarded fixture in the information security industry previously worked as Facebook’s chief security officer following stints as senior director of trust and safety at eBay and associate general counsel at PayPal. Before that he was a federal prosecutor who handled cybercrime cases.

Sullivan's lawyers say Uber’s legal department and its outside counsel were responsible for any failure to report the breach to the FTC.

In cross-examining Borges Sullivan's attorney John Cline asked if “reasonable minds could differ on this disclosure issue” to which Borges replied “Once you have a certain amount of these records it should be an obvious thing.”

“This issue is why you had lawyers involved?” Cline asked. When Borges answered yes Cline pressed “And the lawyers provided the advice about disclosure?”

“Yes” Borges said.

“And you're not a lawyer?” Cline asked.

“No” Borges answered.

Cline also tried to show that Sullivan could have used the bug bounty program as a way of ascertaining the hackers’ true identities. He also elicited testimony from Borges and Flynn that Sullivan had made a “good faith effort” to deal with the breach.

Vasile Mereacre 23 of Toronto and Brandon Glover 26 of Florida pleaded guilty to the hack in October 2019. Sullivan was fired from Uber in 2017 and charged in 2020. Until recently he was chief security officer for Cloudflare.

We're about to find out with a new partnership between Uber and a robotic vehicle startup called Nuro. The two have signed a 10-year deal to have Nuro's robotic vehicles delivering Uber Eats orders and it might save you some cash if you're lucky enough to have a robot deliver dinner.

Nuro was founded in 2016 by former Googlers and it recently became the first autonomous vehicle company to be granted a commercial license in California followed by Arizona and Texas. That means Nuro robots can drive on public roads in a business capacity as opposed to strictly for research earning money for the company with every delivery. That makes it a natural choice for Uber's ongoing efforts to phase out humans.

The partnership will begin with autonomous deliveries in Mountain View California and Houston Texas. Service will expand to the greater Bay Area in the future (Opens in a new window) . These are both regions we've seen other driverless vehicles get started -- they don't have the same volatile inclement weather as many other areas. Rain snow and fog can confuse the sensors that allow autonomous vehicles to navigate roadways. Thus Nuro's permit with California only allows it to operate in fair weather.

Uber says that customers in areas with Nuro service will see a notice in the app that their order may arrive in a robot. However they won't know until it shows up. The company will allow users to opt-out of autonomous deliveries but then you'll have to tip your driver. Any tips added to orders will be refunded if your order is handled by Nuro.

Nuro's compact delivery robot is about the size of a go-kart and the company says it's powered by renewable energy. Further Nuro claims its vehicles have the most advanced sensor array in the industry with 360-degree coverage with LIDAR radar cameras and thermal scopes. It's all backed by custom HD maps and machine learning systems designed to prevent collisions. The small size also apparently makes it better at avoiding obstacles and in the event of a crash it won't do as much damage."

Currently Ulta organizes merchandise by price point. Mass skincare and makeup brands are positioned on one side of the store prestige on the other and fragrance in the middle. Hair care and salon have traditionally been in the back.

Under the new layout that the company will debut in new stores and remodels this fall skincare and makeup will move closer to the front of the store taking advantage of heightened interest in self-care and wellness coming out of the pandemic.

Mass and prestige brands will be displayed next to each other because research indicates consumers increasingly want to shop across price points.

“We really want to have a merchandise layout to magnify our differentiated assortment and really better reflect how a guest really shops with consolidated categories and intuitive adjacencies” Kecia Steelman COO said last week on Ulta’s second-quarter conference call.

Ms. Steelman noted that the items will be marked with “clear brand delineation” to highlight the differences. “You’ll be able to tell the difference between mass and prestige but it will be organized together the way the guest shops it” she said.

Ulta continues to be one of the few retailers that sell both mass and prestige beauty brands adding Chanel and Fenty this year.

The in-store consolidation follows the successful rollout of Ulta Beauty shops inside 186 Target stores with three prestige brands Benefit Tula and Morphe recently added to Target’s selling floors. Ulta CEO Dave Kimbell told analysts of the Target push “We continue to be pleased with overall guest engagement.”

The new layout also comes as consumers are trading down in certain categories due to inflationary pressures although Ulta hasn’t seen a change yet. Mr. Kimbell said “I think that’s a reflection of the importance this category plays in our guest lives — the increasing connection that beauty has to wellness and the desire of our guests to express themselves as the world reopens.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlZmluZXJ5MjkuY29tL2VuLXVzL29ubGluZS1iZWF1dHktbWFrZXVwLXN0b3Jlc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best Online Beauty Stores To Buy Makeup Skin Care 2020,"Beauty

This list has you covered!

It’s no secret that makeup can cost a ton of money especially when you have to order online or drive far away to reach the best big beauty supply store. However you’ll be happy to know there are options online that won’t charge you an arm and a leg for shipping.

Now one drawback is that while there are stores that offer free shipping and free returns (such as SmashBox Cosmetics) most of these beauty product sites don’t. But when it comes to makeup normally you buy products you have already used and are familiar with so you may not really even need to worry about returning items anyway.

There are two kinds of shipping offers you want to look out for when shopping online.

Free Shipping Minimum Order: The first is shipping that requires you to spend a minimum amount of money in order to unlock the free deal. In my opinion this kind of offer can turn out to be a trap if you aren’t careful. It might be tempting to spend an extra $10 on something you didn’t actually want in order to get that deal. However its shipping costs you only $5 in the first place you’re actually losing money! Free Shipping No Minimum: The second type and the best deal is free shipping with no minimum. This is the best type to look for because you can buy whatever you need without loading up on extra junk you didn’t want.

One final thing you want to keep in mind is how long free shipping may take. Some sites offer free two-day shipping and others can take up to a week. If you need a certain item right away be careful when ordering! Make sure it will arrive when you need it.

However with volatility ruling the roost as far as the U.S economy is concerned freight revenues have been moving south of late.

The Cass Freight Shipments Index declined 1.7% month over month in July. What is more concerning is that the measure has decreased in four (January April June and July) of the seven months reported so far this year. High inflation apart supply-chain woes inducing labor and equipment shortages are hurting railroad volumes.

Due to the above-mentioned headwinds the railroad industry has underperformed the S&P 500 Index over the past six months. The stocks in this industry have collectively lost 9.3% while the Zacks S&P 500 composite has declined 7.5%.

Now the question is does the presence of these headwinds imply that stocks from this industry should be ignored by investors? The answer is a categorical no. We believe that dividend-paying railroad stocks like Union Pacific Corporation UNP and Norfolk Southern Corporation NSC should be on investors’ watch list despite the downtrends.

Investors are always on the lookout for dividend stocks as these provide a steady source of income and a cushion against market uncertainty as is the current scenario. Dividend stocks not only provide a solid income stream but also have fewer chances of experiencing wild price swings.

Dividend stocks are safe bets for creating wealth as the payouts generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty. In view of the tailwinds mentioned it can be safely said that dividend-paying stocks appear as a preferred option compared to non-dividend-paying stocks in periods of high degree of market volatility as the present situation.

We zeroed in on the above-mentioned railroad dividend-paying stocks by running the Zacks Stocks Screener. Our choices have a dividend yield in excess of 2% and a dividend payout ratio of less than 50%. Also both stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Union Pacific is based in Omaha NE and has a market capitalization of $142.87 billion currently. UNP’s strong free cash flow-generating ability pleases us. It supports UNP’s shareholder-friendly activities. Cash from operations in 2021 came in at $9 billion up 6% year over year. Free cash flow increased 8.8% to $3523 million in 2021. Cash flow conversion rate was a healthy 73% in the first half of 2022. However supply-chain woes are bothersome.

NSC expects current-year dividends in the 35-40% range of its net income. Management expects to utilize the remaining cash flow and financial leverage to repurchase shares.

Not only has the airline plowed $15 million into Eve Air Mobility it ordered 200 flying taxis and has an option for another 200. United expects to start receiving Eve's four-seater electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle (eVTOL) as soon as 2026.

The company says its investment was spurred by both its confidence in the urban air mobility market and Eve's working relationship with Embraer. According to United  Embrarer is ""a trusted aircraft manufacturer with a proven track record of building and certifying aircraft over the company's 53-year history."" Embrarer previously worked with Uber on a flying taxi project that the latter eventually ditched.

Eve's flying taxi has conventional fixed wings rotors and pushers with a design that United says favors safety efficiency reliability and certifiability. It's said to have a range of 60 miles and United added that the vehicle can ""reduce noise levels by 90 percent compared to current conventional aircraft.""

This isn't the first time United has reached an agreement with an eVTOL company. Last month it put down a $10 million deposit with a different California-based one for 100 flying taxis. As such the company has lined up as many as 500 flying taxis to add to its fleet.

United has set up a corporate venture fund with the aim of bolstering its ambition to reach net zero emissions by 2050 without relying on traditional carbon offsets. Through the United Airlines Ventures fund it has also invested in hydrogen fuel cell engines and sustainable fuel .

""Today United is making history again by becoming the first major airline to publicly invest in two eVTOL companies"" United Airlines Ventures president Michael Leskinen said in a statement. ""Together we believe our suite of clean energy technologies will revolutionize air travel as we know it and serve as the catalyst for the aviation industry to move toward a sustainable future.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaWNhZ29idXNpbmVzcy5jb20vdHJhbnNwb3J0YXRpb24vc3VwZXJzb25pYy1qZXQtZGVhbHQtYmxvdy13aGVuLXJvbGxzLXJveWNlLXB1bGxzLW91dC1ib29tLXRlY2hub2xvZ3lzLXByb3Bvc2Vk0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Supersonic jet dealt a blow when Rolls-Royce pulls out of Boom Technology's proposed aircraft,"“Rolls-Royce has determined that the commercial aviation supersonic market is not currently a priority for us” it said.

Boom said its “become clear that Rolls’ proposed engine design and legacy business model is not the best option for Overture’s future airline operators or passengers.” The firm plans to announce its selected engine partner later this year.

Boom plans a new generation of high-speed jets by the end of the decade aiming to fill the void in superfast trans-Atlantic travel left when Concorde stopped flying in 2003. The program has yet to determine an engine supplier a key step in the jet’s development.

United Airlines Holdings Inc. in June 2021 placed the first order for Boom’s Overture agreeing to buy 15 of the planes in a deal valued at $3 billion at list prices. United took options for 35 more planes. American Airlines Group Inc. placed a firm order for 20 jets last month.

Supersonic travel is also a more difficult proposition as the industry as a whole looks to become more sustainable as supersonic flights generate significantly more carbon.

Boom’s Overture aims to carry 65 to 80 passengers at speeds of Mach 1.7—or almost twice the speed of sound—over water with a range of 4250 nautical miles (7871 km).

Ellen Saracini’s husband Victor Saracini 51 was the captain of United Airlines Flight 175 one of four planes that were seized by Al-Qaeda hijackers and used to attack targets in New York and Washington DC.

After the plane took off from Boston bound for Los Angeles hijackers stormed the cockpit and killed the pilot and the first mate Michael Horrocks. They then flew the plane into the South Tower of the World Trade Center striking at it 9.03am.

The attack on the South Tower was the second plane to strike the WTC. Less than 20 minutes earlier another hijacked jet American Airlines Flight 11 had been flown into the North Tower.

For many people including Ms Saracini it was the moment they knew these were not accidents.

“As Victor’s plane struck we realised we were a nation at war” she told The Independent.

Ms Saracini said she had been on the couple’s children’s school that day in Lower Makefield Township Pennsylvania overseeing a meeting for volunteers when the first initial news reached them of what was happening in New York.

She said somebody told her that an American Airlines plane was involved so she “cancelled the meeting and went home and saw [it] on TV”.

At around 10.30am that day it was confirmed that her husband a former navy aviator who who loved his family and also loved to drive his Corvette and his motorcycle was presumed dead. A week later she and her daughters Brielle and Kirsten attended a memorial mass for her husband where he received a US navy honor guard and she was handed a folded Stars and Stripes.

In the years since the attacks Ms Saracini has worked determinedly to improve aviation safety and in particular to ensure the cockpits on passenger planes have a second door.

In 2019 she saw real success when Congress passed the Saracini Aviation Safety Act requiring all new aircraft to be fitted with a second cockpit door.

Yet she has said her work is not complete as the 2019 law only applied to new aircraft. She said the Federal Aviation Administration has acknowledged cockpit doors remain vulnerable so all operating planes should be required to have a second door. She is working with her congressman Republican Brian Fitzpatrick to push through a new measure.

“We can agree that September 11 changed the world. And there are things about September 11 that haven’t been answered yet. Haven’t been disclosed haven’t been protected again” she said.

“So that’s my part of standing up to right the wrongs. And I won’t stop. You know the flight crews Victor’s brothers and sisters are in the air flying. And they’ve become my brothers and sisters. We can’t leave them vulnerable up there.”

She added: “And it will be Victor’s legacy that he would not have died in vain.”

Ms Saracini donated one of her husband’s spare United Airlines’ pilot caps to the 9/11 Memorial and Museum.

She also made use of the cap to symbolise her late husband when their youngest daughter Brielle got married in 2017.

Their daughter’s husband Sean McGuire also lost his father in the 9/11 attacks and the couple met at a camp that had been established for the children whose parents had been killed that day.

Ms Saracini previously told CBS News that her final words to her husband on the day he was killed and his to her were: “I love you”."
UPS,United Parcel Service,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vZnJlZXJhbmdlYW1lcmljYW4udXMvdXBzLXNoaXBwaW5nLWZpcmVhcm1zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why UPS Has Strict New Rules for Shipping Firearms,"One of the largest shipping and receiving companies in the world has taken a decidedly anti-gun stance with a set of strict new rules about shipping firearms. United Parcel Service (UPS) which has been a US-based company since 1907 recently revised its Tariff/Terms & Conditions of Service making it more difficult for businesses and regular people to use UPS to ship firearms.

The changes come on the heels of the company’s decision to terminate shipping accounts for gun dealers across the country even going so far as seizing and destroying their packages as they were en route to customers according to Ammoland.com.

“While we oppose the anti-gun policies that certain companies like UPS are imposing upon our industry we do not advocate boycotting them. We want as many options as possible to get guns and parts out to law-abiding consumers. The best approach is to educate the public about what’s going on and let market forces take it from there.” — T.J. Cronan Ghost Rifles

The new UPS regulations effective Aug. 29 impose stricter shipping rules for firearms.

Back in June a Florida-based gun dealer Ghost Rifles was told by UPS that tens of thousands of dollars in product it had shipped to customers might be destroyed.

“We do not ship to states where they’re not allowed” said company owner Joe Zatar at the time. “We are in total compliance. We had ATF in here just two weeks ago and they told us we were completely legal.”

Brownells set off alarm bells on July 1 with a Facebook post (since removed) saying UPS had allegedly terminated its account and would no longer be accepting its shipments. Indeed the massive online gun and gun parts dealer currently lists only USPS and FedEx as shipping options on its shipping info page.

Rules for UPS shipping firearms and gun parts have become extremely strict as of last month.

The shipping giant’s actions seem to be in response to a letter sent to at least 27 carriers in several states and in Canada that was signed by five US Senators: Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) Cory A. Booker (D-NJ) Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) Edward Markey (D-MA) and Christopher S. Murphy (D-CT).

“We are writing to request information on the number of firearms shipped by [your company] in the last years” the identical letters say. “We are concerned that lax shipping security measures are contributing to the epidemic of gun violence in this country by allowing criminals to use stolen firearms to commit crimes.”

The letters went on to request detailed responses to a long list of questions including:

How many firearms has the carrier shipped between January 1 2017 and December 31 2021?

What policies and procedures are presently in place to prevent loss and theft of firearm shipments?

How does the carrier define a “firearm?”

Are “imitation firearms frames receivers ammunition and silencers” included in that definition?

What records exist to track packages containing firearms as well as lost or stolen shipments?’

Since rules for UPS shipping firearms have been ratcheted up Brownells is now listing only USPS and FedEx for shipping options for all its products.

UPS joins a long list of companies that have been pressured by anti-gun activists and politicians to restrict access to their services and systems by gun makers retailers fabricators and others in the gun industry. Some have dubbed this practice “corporate gun control” and say it’s a blatant attempt to make it more difficult for the firearms industry to conduct business — de facto gun control in other words.

Ghost Rifles is a gun dealer in Daytona Florida that sells AR upper receivers lowers handguards and OEM gun parts as well as 80% AR (unfinished) receivers — the primary components of so-called “ghost guns.”

On June 20 UPS formally notified the Florida company that its shipping account had been canceled. UPS further informed the company that “any package found in its system determined to have been tendered by GHOST FIREARMS might be seized and destroyed.”

Immediately before receiving this notification Ghost Rifles had shipped more than $30000 in product to fulfill customer orders.

A complete AR upper receiver. UPS says it will no longer ship an item like this if it’s not serialized.

T.J. Cronan General Manager with Ghost Rifles told Free Range American that UPS did end up delivering those shipments to customers. “Our representative at UPS initially knew nothing of the letter we received” he said. “We were eventually told that the threat to ‘seize and destroy’ our packages was a mistake. That said UPS has yet to reinstate our account.”

“I’ve been in the firearms business for more than eight years” he added. “Nothing surprises me anymore. Amazon PayPal and Shopify have all shut down payment gatewaysx and numerous large banks have denied us services. I have more ATF contacts in my phone than you’d believe. I talk to the ATF so often they are probably sick of hearing from me.”

The recently updated “How to Ship Firearms” page at UPS.com now stipulates that “any item that meets the definition of a firearm (including firearm mufflers or silencers) or a ‘frame’ or ‘receiver’ under federal law (including any partially complete disassembled or nonfunctional frame or receiver […] must be identified and bear a serial number in satisfaction of the requirements for identifying such items under federal law […] regardless of whether any such items are otherwise exempt from or not subject to identification requirements under applicable law.”

The near halt of UPS shipping firearms came after letters were sent to various shippers and gun dealers by a group of US Senators.

Parts for homemade guns will also be more difficult to ship.

Cronan said that while he doesn’t approve of the stance UPS and other companies have taken against the gun industry he doesn’t advocate any kind of retaliation.

“The point is Ghost Rifles is not some fly-by-night company trying to do business in a dark alley. We’ve taken great care to make sure we are following the letter of the law and we will continue to do so” Cronan said. “While we oppose the anti-gun policies that certain companies like UPS are imposing upon our industry we do not advocate boycotting them. We want as many options as possible to get guns and parts out to law-abiding consumers. The best approach is to educate the public about what’s going on and let market forces take it from there.”

A1A Software LLC has released the first two lift planning tools in its new application-based A1A Product Suite. Rigging Designer enables users to create custom rigging plans and Sketch Pad provides a way to sketch preliminary job site data for bids and estimates.

Each of the apps can be used individually or as part of the entire Product Suite.

“Moving from web-based to app-based platforms improves functionality for users” said Tawnia Weiss president of A1A Software.

""Users don’t have to have an internet connection to use the tools. “These apps—and more to come by early 2023—can be used anywhere you can use your mobile phone.""

Rigging Designer is designed for any application where loads must be rigged whether that’s for lifting by a mobile crane overhead crane a gantry or industrial forklift. Point/Click and Drag/Drop functionality can be used to create custom rigging designs. Individuals may also choose from hundreds of pre-built rigging products loads and objects. Users of A1A Software’s 3D Lift Plan have the option to import their rigging designs into the lift planning software for use later.

Sketch Pad first introduced as a web-based tool in 2019 makes the move to an app. With GPS location services enabled on your mobile device Sketch Pad now allows you to add a scaled Google Map from the job site location.

“It’s the same Sketch Pad customers love only better” said Weiss.

Used by those who are preparing bids or estimates preliminary data about the job site can be drawn on screen using your finger. Crane location travel path obstructions and other information can be noted for future lift planning. Individuals also have access to a library of commonly used 3D objects for adding to the sketch which can be printed or converted into a full 3D Lift Plan.

The on-highway truck joins the new Western Star 47X and 49X to complete a lineup purpose-built for toughness productivity and efficiency.

“With the addition of the 57X Western Star’s new X-Series now rises to the next level” said David Carson senior vice president sales and marketing Daimler Truck North America (DTNA). “While the 47X and 49X serve the vocational customer the 57X was conceived designed and engineered specifically for owner-operators and small fleets looking for a truck that provides the safety efficiency durability and prestige that only Western Star can deliver.”

Reaches new heights in efficiency

The 57X is the most fuel-efficient truck Western Star has ever built. It is 5.8 percent more fuel-efficient than its predecessor the 5700XE while delivering legendary Western Star dependability and productivity.

The 57X gives owners a choice of Detroil engine models. The DD13 Gen 5 DD15 Gen 5 and DD16 engines all deliver proven maximum on-highway performance and fuel economy.

Dixon was the dominant driver at this year’s Indianapolis 500 presented by Gainbridge having just led his 95th lap when he came to pit road for his final stop of the race. But speeding on entry by the slightest of margins drew a penalty he couldn’t overcome. Instead of winning the race for the second time in his career Dixon was reduced to finishing 21st.

That moment still looms large. Dixon enters the Firestone Grand Prix of Monterey trailing series leader Will Power of Team Penske by 20 points. Had Dixon even finished in the top three on May 29 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway he could have a nearly insurmountable lead. Winning the double-points “500” might have had him ahead by 60 or more points at this juncture.

“Had we won Indy the championship might be over” he said. “But that’s part of racing man. You’ve got to take with the highs with the lows. I moved on the Monday after the race. You’ve got to. I can’t change it.”

Dixon has been on the gas ever since the series’ most consistent driver in the months of June July August and the first race of September. His wins in the Honda Indy Toronto and the Big Machine Music City Grand Prix in Nashville are part of his 10 consecutive top-nine finishes since the “500.”

Dixon leads all series drivers in points scored since that May disappointment with 337. Power has scored 321.

“I would say that’s our natural occurrence to be honest” Chip Ganassi Racing driver Dixon said of late-season heroics in his 21-year career. “I feel like consistency is definitely the key (to winning titles) especially in the current format of the NTT INDYCAR SERIES with how competitive the championship is with depth.

“Your best days are like at Portland where you start 16th and you end up with a third or in St. Louis when we ended up eighth. Those are still points you’re putting in the bag. You need to average fifth or sixth throughout the season to have a shot (at the championship). It simplifies things but trust me a lot of those days are really hard days.”

Dixon likely will need another of those days Sunday when the green flag waves for the start of the 95-lap race. His No. 9 PNC Bank Chip Ganassi Racing Honda hasn’t been strong on road course qualifying resulting in starting positions of 13th at Barber Motorsports Park 21st and 20th in the two road course races at IMS ninth at Road America fifth at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course and 16th at Portland International Raceway. He is hoping that the team’s recent test at Laguna Seca helps but he knows nothing is certain.

“The downside of things is how you got in that situation” he said of disappointing efforts in road course qualifying. “But when you figure (the race) out that’s the winning formula or the part you’re most happy about.”

If Dixon emerges as the series champion Sunday he’ll tie A.J. Foyt for the most titles in the sport’s history.

Others Strong in Second Half Too

Dixon isn’t the only driver who has enjoyed a strong second half of the season. Josef Newgarden Power and Scott McLaughlin all have at least 320 points since the “500” proof of the competitiveness this series has delivered this season particularly at the top of the grid.

Newgarden (No. 2 Hitachi Team Penske Chevrolet) has won three races since Indy McLaughlin (No. 3 XPEL Team Penske Chevrolet) two. Power got his only win of the season in the Chevrolet Detroit Grand Prix presented by Lear the week after the “500.”

Newgarden is tied with Dixon in the standings and he holds the tiebreaker over all the title contenders by virtue of having the most race wins this season (with five). His race Sunday figures to be hit or miss just like the rest of his season.

“It’s a funny thing to say but when you strip the wins away it’s been a really tough year” Newgarden said. “So I’m incredibly grateful that we’re in it with an opportunity still. We needed that door to still be open; now let’s try to climb through it.”

Power: Bad Luck Last Year

It has been quite the turnaround for series points leader Power who this time last year was ninth in the standings 180 points behind eventual champion Alex Palou (No. 10 NTT DATA Chip Ganassi Racing Honda) heading to the finale with no chance at the title.

Power finished ninth in points last year his lowest since joining Team Penske full time in 2010. He credited Chevrolet for the 2022 gains adding that things have simply gone more his way this year.

“Look I think last year we just had bad luck and we didn’t show our true potential” Power said. “This year Chevy improved the driveability (of the engine) which helped a lot sort of got us into a nice window.”

Power said Team Penske spent the offseason focused on improving its chances in the “500” and they did put very little emphasis on road courses street circuits even short ovals.

“We really haven’t turned up with anything special as it relates to last year which shows that the cars were good” Power said. “We just have put everything together really well this year and the engine driveability has helped significantly.”

Team Penske drivers have combined to win 10 of the 16 races and all three of them are still in contention for this championship.

“Outside of the Indy 500 I think we’ve really had the best cars in the paddock” Newgarden said.

Envision Healthcare filed suit against the insurer the physician firm announced Friday over claims denied by the country's largest health plan. UnitedHealthcare axed Envision from its network in early 2021 saying that Envision's high costs did not reflect fair market rates.

Later on Friday UnitedHealthcare countersued the physician firm accusing it of fraudulently upcoding claims for services provided to UHC members.

Envision said in the announcement that prior to its removal from UHC's network the insurer has denied about 18% of submitted commercial claims. In November 2021 after it was pulled from the network that number spiked to 48% of all claims according to Envision.

For the highest-acuity claims UnitedHealthcare denied 60% of those submitted.

“After pushing Envision clinicians out-of-network in January 2021 United began a routine and systematic denial of commercial claims related to emergency room care for its members with the highest acuity—patients who sought care for life-threatening illnesses and complications” said Jim Rechtin Envision Healthcare CEO in the announcement.

“United’s scheme to deny patient claims violates federal law. Improperly withholding payment from the very frontline clinicians who treated their members in their most acute time of need is in my opinion cold callous and inhumane"" Rechtin said.

A spokesperson for UnitedHealthcare said the insurer is reviewing Envision's filing. In the second lawsuit filed Friday in Tennessee federal court the insurer said that it had approached Envision with evidence of upcoding that suggested UHC had overpaid Envision to the tune of millions.

UnitedHealth said in the countersuit that Envision ""systematically misrepresented"" services it rendered to UnitedHealth members across thousands of claims in order to bilk the insurer for higher payments. UHC said it then came to Envision with the evidence it had including a draft of the complaint filed Friday seeking a remedy.

""Rather than act in good faith Envision took United’s confidential complaint provided under Rule 408 and quickly and quietly drafted its own complaint based on United’s and filed it without warning in an effort to beat United to the courthouse"" the insurer said in its lawsuit. ""Despite engaging in fraud on United that has been independently verified by academic studies whistleblowers and United’s own firsthand investigation Envision has now attempted to recast United as the villain claiming United has unreasonably denied or 'downcoded' its fraudulent claims. Envision’s bad-faith tactics have left United no choice but to seek recourse in this court.""

""United brings this action to put a stop to Envision’s fraud and to recoup the amounts Envision obtained through its scheme"" the insurer said.

Envision's lawsuit includes several examples of claims that were denied including in the case of a 31-year-old man who needed an emergency appendectomy. Claims for the man's care underwent a ""pre-payment review"" and were then denied Envision said.

UHC has battled with Envision and its physician staffing rival TeamHealth over reimbursements. TeamHealth sued UnitedHealth in July over alleged downcoding for emergency care services.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9tb3JlLXVyZ2VudC1jYXJlLWNsaW5pY3MtYXJlLWNvbWluZy10by1taW5uZXNvdGEvNjAwMjA1NTQ3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,More urgent care clinics are coming to Minnesota,"The urgent care market experienced two opposing forces during the pandemic: Health care companies mothballed growth plans even as more patients sought care from these walk-in medical centers.

In the midst of it all Minnetonka-based UnitedHealth Group significantly scaled back its MedExpress urgent care operations in Minnesota and across the country.

But now the go-go urgent care market seems poised for a comeback with plans for new facilities resurrected to meet demand from patients who recently discovered they like the convenience.

In August a franchisee with Alabama-based American Family Care opened a clinic in Hopkins — the company's first urgent care location in Minnesota — and plans to open a second center soon. Compcare Occupational Medicine & Urgent Care a Minnesota company added locations this summer in Cottage Grove and Eagan. And in May Duluth-based Essentia Health opened a new center in Cloquet.

Centers were too busy with patients during COVID-19 surges — and too constrained by staffing shortages and supply chain problems — to open many more facilities during the pandemic said Lou Ellen Horwitz chief executive of the Urgent Care Association.

There are just more than 11000 free-standing urgent care centers across the country the trade group says up 20% year-to-date. A more typical annual growth rate is about 11% Horwitz said adding that the number of centers across the U.S. basically held steady during 2020 and 2021.

Operators are optimistic she said because many patients turned to urgent care for the first time during the COVID-19 health crisis and are now coming back for more.

""Urgent care did very well through the pandemic because we were open"" Horwitz said. ""Growth in terms of new centers pretty much stopped on a large scale mostly because there was so much scrambling to manage the pandemic that there was not a lot of bandwidth for building clinics. But now we're catching up.""

Urgent care centers generally treat on a walk-in basis illness and injury that is not life- or limb-threatening although specific services can vary. They provide a mix of health services that often are offered at primary-care clinics and/or hospital emergency rooms as well — treating everything from coughs and colds to fractures and stitches.

Prices at urgent care tend to be much lower than at hospital emergency rooms said Dr. Franz Ritucci of the National Urgent Care Center Accreditation a nonprofit in Florida. Crowding at primary care offices can make it difficult to get a prompt appointment so urgent care serves as an important back-up source Ritucci said.

""Urgent care centers are the reliever airports for the system"" he said using the term for relief airports that provide extra capacity for landing planes. ""Growth is back. The numbers are surging up.""

Over the past decade urgent care emerged as one of several ways for large health care companies to get a foothold in the business of delivering medical care directly to patients.

UnitedHealth Group acquired MedExpress in 2015 when the business included about 140 urgent cares.

The next year the company was poised to shake up Minnesota's urgent care market by opening as many as 19 centers in less than two years. But in the end the health care giant opened only a dozen MedExpress clinics across the state and has since downsized operations here to just five locations.

MedExpress operates more than 150 centers down from more than 260 in 2019.

""We respond to local market conditions when determining our footprint and we remain committed to serving patients in comprehensive and convenient ways that support their health"" UnitedHealth Group said in a statement to the Star Tribune.

UnitedHealth and other large conglomerates are still investing in care delivery. This month Rhode Island-based CVS Health announced an $8 billion deal to acquire Signify Health a large employer of doctors and nurses that provides care in patient homes.

Most urgent care providers in Minnesota are part of large health systems like HealthPartners which consolidated three area urgent cares during the pandemic. That took the total number of centers from 22 down to 19 and the Bloomington-based nonprofit expects the count will hold fairly stable over the next year.

Minneapolis-based M Health Fairview operates 11 urgent care centers — the same number as before the pandemic.

""Entrants to the market come and go"" Kim DeRoche chief of primary care at M Health Fairview said in a statement. ""But we have more than 100 years of providing high quality efficient patient care to Minnesotans and that won't change regardless of who enters this market.""

The Urgency Room a chain of three urgent care centers in the east metro is looking to expand said Dr. Craig Matticks the group's medical director.

With ownership by a large group of more than 200 emergency physicians the Urgency Room can provide more acute care than others and saw a surge of patients during the pandemic for COVID-19 testing Matticks said.

The centers continue to see more patients he said in part because of hospital backups where transitional care centers with staffing problems are struggling to take discharges.

""We are still seeing high volumes due to the through-put issues many health systems are experiencing in their emergency departments and from the closure or reduced hours of some local urgent cares"" he said.

In 2019 Compcare opened its first location in Owatonna with a goal of bringing urgent care to rural communities. Last year it launched an urgent care center in Rochester in a building that used to house a MedExpress.

Cooper Rendon owner of the Inver Grove Heights-based company is an entrepreneur and physician assistant who said he started the business after seeing a need for walk-in urgent care. The company's seven centers also treat workplace illness and injuries and they've introduced physical therapy services.

""We added three new locations this year and I don't foresee that slowing down"" said Kati Poterucha Compcare's vice president of marketing.

The new American Family Care franchise in Hopkins offers urgent care and occupational medicine in six exam rooms plus space for procedures X-rays and an on-site lab.

A student of health administration franchisee Tom Stevens opted to go in a different professional direction his family's business running Maynard's Restaurants in Excelsior and Rogers and Malone's Bar and Grill in Maple Grove. The restaurants have grown while being community-minded Stevens said and he's hoping for the same in urgent care.

The clinic already is in-network with most large local health insurers and he's working to add one remaining major carrier Stevens said. Dr. Paul Allegra a local emergency physician is the urgent care's medical director and a co-owner.

Owners at other American Family Care franchises have cautioned against trying to grow too far too fast Stevens said adding: ""We really want to start with two [urgent cares] and then just basically take a step back and make sure our model and our systems are in place and working.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByYWN0aWNhbGVjb21tZXJjZS5jb20vZWNvbW1lcmNlLWJyaWVmcy1mYmEtaW5jcmVhc2VzLWZlZXMtd2FsbWFydC1leHBhbmRzLWhlYWx0aGNhcmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ecommerce Briefs: FBA Increases Fees; Walmart Expands Healthcare,"“Ecommerce Briefs” is my occasional series on news and developments that impact online merchants. In this installment I address Amazon’s holiday fee increase new Prime benefits and the company’s ongoing competition with Walmart in subscription services and healthcare.

New Holiday FBA Fees

Amazon recently announced it is raising fees for Fulfillment by Amazon sellers during the holiday shopping season as it struggles with rising costs. From October 15 through January 14 sellers who use FBA will pay a 35-cent surcharge per item sold in the U.S. or Canada. This is the first time Amazon has increased seller fees for the holidays.

The company told sellers in an email that it is implementing the surcharge because “…expenses are reaching new heights.” It is the second new fee levied on merchants this year. In April Amazon imposed a 5% fuel and inflation surcharge.

Perks Competition

In August Amazon announced new perks for its U.S. Prime members. They can now shop for products from certain retailers on the Amazon app and Amazon.com and have the goods delivered the same day to select ZIP codes in more than 10 cities.

The partnerships are with omnichannel apparel merchant Pacsun health and nutrition retailer GNC kitchen goods provider Sur La Table global clothing retailer Superdry and omnichannel apparel brand Diesel. Brands and retailers selling through Prime will have access to Amazon’s logistics and fulfillment capability in addition to fast delivery to consumers.

Amazon values the perk at $59. Also in August Amazon partnered with food delivery firm Grubhub to give Prime members a Grubhub+ membership for one year. Normally the membership costs $9.99 a month.

Amazon is expanding Prime benefits to secure member retention at a time when the number of new subscribers is dwindling. Growth in subscription revenue was 10% in Q2 2022 compared to 30% in the same quarter of 2021. Amazon is attempting to provide more value to Prime members and keep members from leaving. Amazon first offered its Prime subscription in 2005 at $79 annually and remained at that level for years.

In February 2022 Amazon raised the subscription price from $119 to $139. Some members are evaluating whether Prime is still a good value. In April of this year in a letter to shareholders Amazon said Prime had more than 200 million members. Consumer Intelligence Research Partners has estimated the number at 172 million.

Walmart on the other hand has kept its Walmart+ program at $98 per year. It recently announced a partnership with Paramount for a streaming service to Walmart+ members: a Paramount+ Essential subscription (with advertisements) at no extra cost.

Amazon and Walmart will likely continue to compete for subscribers by enriching their respective offerings through 2023.

Healthcare

Two weeks ago Amazon disclosed that it would shut down its much-heralded telehealth service Amazon Care on December 31. The service — which offers virtual urgent care services free telehealth consults and in-home visits from nurses — began in 2019 as a pilot program for Amazon employees in Seattle.

This past February the company expanded the virtual offerings nationwide for its employees and also to enterprise companies. However in a statement to employees announcing the program’s end the company said Amazon Care “…is not a complete enough offering for the large enterprise customers we have been targeting and wasn’t going to work long-term.” Nevertheless CEO Andy Jassy has stated that as ecommerce growth slows Amazon is looking to healthcare for additional revenue.



While Amazon is ending its virtual care program Walmart announced on September 7 that it would expand virtual healthcare services in 2023. Walmart and healthcare conglomerate UnitedHealth Group are joining forces in a 10-year plan to provide preventive care to seniors 65 and up in certain Medicare Advantage plans and virtual healthcare for all age groups — starting with 15 Walmart Health locations in Florida and Georgia. The program will eventually include other locations.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvdGFlc2lreW9vbi8yMDIyLzA5LzA5L3doeS1zaWduaWZ5LWhhcy10aGUtcG90ZW50aWFsLXRvLWFkZC1zaWduaWZpY2FudC12YWx1ZS10by1jdnNzLXN0b2NrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Signify Has The Potential To Add Significant Value To CVS's Stock,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/taesikyoon/2022/09/09/why-signify-has-the-potential-to-add-significant-value-to-cvss-stock/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvdGFlc2lreW9vbi8yMDIyLzA5LzA5L3doeS1zaWduaWZ5LWhhcy10aGUtcG90ZW50aWFsLXRvLWFkZC1zaWduaWZpY2FudC12YWx1ZS10by1jdnNzLXN0b2NrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vZW1lYS8yMDIyL2Etcm91Z2gtZ3VpZGUtdG8tZXVyb3Blcy1vcGVuLWJhbmtpbmctcGxhdGZvcm1zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Guide to Europe's Open Banking Platforms,"It is now nearly seven years since the European Commission passed the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) and nearly three years since the final deadline for all businesses within the European Union to comply with PSD2’s technical standards.

Stepping up to help banks meet the requirements of the directive and create the infrastructure needed for account-to-account payments several open banking platforms have risen to prominence in recent years.

As open banking matures different platforms are honing their specialties and key players are defining their place in the emerging ecosystem.

Comparing open banking platforms is difficult as there is no standard measurement for coverage and different providers tend to specialize in different regions.

For example in terms of the total number of bank APIs connected Nordigen leads the pack but that doesn’t mean it is necessarily the right choice for a business that wants to start accepting open banking payments.

Nordigen is more in the business of aggregating data than it is in the payments game. That said last month GoCardless closed a deal to acquire the Latvian FinTech which will see Nordigen’s impressive access to Europe’s bank accounts integrated into the GoCardless payment system.

Open Banking and Payments

One of the most frequently cited leaders in European open banking is Tink. The Visa-owned company has built a reputation for reverse engineering bank APIs and is able to offer businesses direct data access that goes far deeper than transaction records.

Tink’s API can access an extensive range of financial data while the company has also built some of the most powerful analytics and categorization tools on the market. Tink has proven an especially popular provider with some of the biggest names in the industry and boasts clients spanning from legacy banks to innovative FinTechs.

More recently Tink has enhanced its offering to lenders with the addition of Expense Check a real-time credit assessment tool that helps loan issuers build an accurate picture of a customer’s creditworthiness based on comprehensive up-to-date transaction data.

In terms of initiating payments TrueLayer may well have a claim to the title of Europe’s leading open banking platform. The U.K.-based FinTech allows any app developer to integrate open banking payments including variable recurring payments and has been one of the firms helping to drive open payments adoption in the U.K.

What’s more in the connected global economy TrueLayer can help facilitate open banking payments far beyond the borders of the U.K. And through a partnership with Singapore-based cross-border payments platform Thunes TrueLayer is being integrated into its platform as one of the payment methods for Thunes’ 100000 merchants around the world.

TrueLayer is an interesting case as it provides both an infrastructure and a payment method. In other words it does the work of aggregating account data and mediating between APIs but also packages its technology together into a payments solution that merchants can use.

Another London-based firm that is generating a lot of excitement in the field is Yapily. Unlike TrueLayer Yapily focuses on the infrastructure layer and leaves the payments side of things to its partners one of which is Volt the real-time payment specialist that uses the Yapily API to power its open payments gateway.

Not to be confused with Volt Amsterdam-based open banking provider Yolt provides both account information and payment initiation services to clients in the banking and finance sector as well as helping to facilitate payments for a range of businesses from eCommerce to utilities and insurance.

Launched by Dutch banking group ING as a personal financial management app in 2017 the firm has been positioning itself as a one-stop-shop for European open banking and last year was granted PSD2 licenses in both the U.K. and the EU.

But last month ING announced that it would be phasing out the open banking platform citing a “rapidly evolving and changing market” as the main factor behind the decision.

Besides the FinTechs discussed here the likes of Mastercard-owned Aiia Klarna and Token have all made notable contributions to Europe’s contemporary open banking ecosystem and will surely continue to shape how the field develops.

To complicate matters further non-European firms like Plaid also have an interest in the continent’s open banking project while the global card networks are unlikely to allow the ascendent payments paradigm to leave them in the dust.

For example as much as open banking is lauded as a way to bypass the likes of Visa and Mastercard both companies also have a stake in its continued growth the former through Tink and the latter through Aiia.

The Seventy-fifth Session of the Regional Committee for WHO South-East Asia concluded here today with Member countries committing to resilient health systems accelerating multisectoral actions to address priority health issues and reenergizing comprehensive primary health services to build societies that are more inclusive equitable and resilient against present and future emergencies.



“We are at a history-defining juncture. Over the past two and a half years the Region and the world have witnessed immense transformative change. It is important for us not just to spend more on health but to spend efficiently and spend equitably. Our focus must be on vulnerable populations we must identify them and see how best we can address their needs. We cannot leave anyone behind as we seek to drive rapid and sustained progress towards universal health coverage health security and health for all” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh Regional Director WHO South-East Asia.



Building on the lessons learnt from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic countries committed to strengthening emergency preparedness and build health systems that are also resilient to environment and climate change.



The annual governing body meeting of WHO in the Region which met in person for the first time since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic after a gap of three years adopted the Paro Declaration to address mental health through primary care and community engagement.



The Regional Committee adopted resolutions to accelerate progress against non-communicable diseases including oral health and integrated eye care and promote social participation to strengthen primary health care in support of universal health coverage.

The year 2018 ushered in a new era for universal healthcare in India with the announcement of the world’s largest health insurance scheme The Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana—giving financial assistance for hospital care for the most vulnerable population. However to utilise the benefits the key missing piece was the hospital itself. India’s healthcare infrastructure remains skewed towards top cities while Tier II and Tier III townships—the India that is Bharat which houses a majority of the beneficiaries—find themselves handicapped. India has 1.4 beds/ 1000 . Further c.70 percent of total beds in India are concentrated in urban centre that houses just about 35 percent of the total country’s population.

India’s hinterland suffers from an acute supply side problem which includes a lack of proper hospital infrastructure doctors nurses and paramedics—each feeding and creating a vicious cycle. An individual has little choice but to travel far to access any form of secondary clinical care. Rural health statistics show that 50 percent of the states do not have even one central hospital per district. Of the 36 states and union territories—for which data is available—18 do not have a hospital in each district. This defeats the purpose of universal healthcare that the government set out to achieve under the National Health Mission.

Existing barriers

The demand and supply gap in healthcare has persisted partly because the government’s efforts at building infrastructure have not kept pace with the need. And partly because the private sector has stayed away from investing in Tier II-III geographies. The reasons are low volume paying demand the uncertainty of demand cost recovery and lack of skilled human resources rendering it commercially unviable. Other reasons were inadequate civic infrastructures such as erratic power and water supply difficulty in raising finances and a cumbersome process of land acquisition and clearances. While healthcare remains a key social sector pillar commercial viability for private capital in the short- to long term and for the government sector in the long term remains paramount for a sustained offering of quality and affordable care.

The biggest challenge is the availability of qualified doctors nurses and paramedics. Smaller towns have low demand and low paying capacity which tilts the scale for any resources towards cities because they provide earning opportunities and better infrastructure to operate. According to the government India's doctor-population ratio at 1:854 is better than the World Health Organization's standard of 1:1000. But it is not of much consolation because this is based on the assumption of 80 percent availability of registered allopathic doctors and 5.65 lakh AYUSH doctors. However 88 percent of doctors operate in cities and Tier I towns. The same is the case for nurses with 1.96 nurses per 1000 population. It is less than the WHO recommendation of 3 per 1000. A large part of health services in Bharat is dominated by doctor-owned small to mid-sized centres offering a few basic specialities; there are very few quality tertiary care facilities.

Learnings from the past

Successive governments both at the centre and state have tried to resurrect the infrastructure through different models including the viability gap funding (VGF) model to ensure proper healthcare facilities. The VGF scheme launched in 2004 is a grant to support projects that are socially and economically justified but are not financially viable. As a capital subsidy to attract private sector investments in PPP projects efforts have so far gone in vain. The primary reason is the design construct of some of these programmes which were more focused on financial support than addressing the key fundamentals of channelling demand pricing and human resources. The VGF model in its earlier avatar also did not focus much on service pricing which is fundamental and has implications on quality. It was also not realised that resources are best managed by selecting locations that can help attract clinical talent or have medical colleges and institutions that would have helped meet the supply gap. Also previous VGFs gave limited thought to the right construct for demand channelling. It could have been made mandatory for state-supported patients to avail of services in specific hospitals to ensure regular flow of patients higher revenue and flexibility to treat private patients at market-determined prices.

Key tenets of success

Today given the fact that some of the important building blocks such as public insurance and digitisation are coming together at a frenetic pace it is time for us to transform the infrastructural landscape with systemic structural changes through innovative and sustainable models of care delivery as well as business processes. A multi-pronged strategy can be attempted through different models but each one must have a baseline structure with a measure for success. We need to work with two important tenets the first being a commercially viable proposition and the second that it should be programmed for adaptation and replication in other settings.

Commercially viable projects need:

1) a large patient volume inflow and viable pricing to take care of quality services and account for large fixed expenditure from a clinical and regulatory standpoint

2) subsidy support to bring down the capital

3) timely payments for improved rotation of capital to generate returns for the operator and last and very important

4) supply of clinical and non-clinical manpower to deliver services.

Selecting the right locations to build the first few models of success will solve most of the aforementioned issues. Secondly pricing should be benchmarked to the cost of quality services and should factor in all the elements.

Thirdly it should be made mandatory for the government-insured population within that catchment area to seek hospitalisation only at the empanelled hospitals. If a hospital is unable to take the patient it will refer them to the nearest hospital thereby controlling patient flow. Lastly for a sustainable return on investments private players must be offered subsidised resources for managing CapEx (land and investments) and OpEx (overheads/running costs). Under the VFG model higher weightage must be given to OpEx which is recurring to make it viable for private providers to invest in Bharat.

One can conclude that there could be three possible business models involving private players that the government can evaluate—the first being the VGF model in a revamped form wherein higher weightage is given to OpEx. The second model is an aggregation model wherein a qualified healthcare company (selected through auction) is appointed as a master franchisee. It can aggregate (on pre-agreed fees) and streamline the current supply base to minimum quality standards in an identified catchment area. Then channel the demand/patient flow to these aggregated centres. The third is a Health Maintenance Organisation (HMO) model wherein one or more qualified healthcare companies via auction take the responsibility of both primary and hospitalisation care (though green field or brownfield) for a catchment area. They will channel all insurance patients both on capitation fee (primary care) and service fee (hospitalisations and diagnostics).

Each of these will need varied commitments from the government such as subsidised land financing single-window clearance to location-adjusted pricing and infrastructure support. But they can provide the solutions we urgently need.

Rising patient needs are placing huge pressure on our limited resources and healthcare infrastructure. With the Government increasing healthcare outlay in the last two years and digital health bolstering service delivery this is the time to shift from a tactical approach to a longer-term strategy to make affordable healthcare in Bharat a reality and help India get close to achieving universal health coverage.

“George Washington University faculty are key to our mission of education research and patient care and endowed professorships are critical to our recruiting efforts and ability to further this mission” said President Mark S. Wrighton. “These professorships are a very important investment in the long-term positive impact our university will have on society.”

The transformative investment into the endowment for the professorships is a result of the proceeds from the recent sale of the university’s partnership interest in GW Hospital which is owned by Universal Health Services Inc. Wrighton announced the news of the professorships at a Faculty Senate meeting on Friday.

The 14 new professorships will be established in schools across the university and support a broad range of disciplines. Nine of the endowed professorships will be created in the School of Medicine and Health Sciences one in the Milken Institute School of Public Health one in the School of Nursing one each in chemistry and biology in the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences and one in biomedical engineering in the School of Engineering and Applied Science.

“Preeminent faculty are an essential component of fulfilling our academic mission of creating a high-quality instructional environment pushing the frontier of knowledge through research and as we continue to expand our academic medical enterprise providing high-quality patient care” Provost Christopher Alan Bracey said.

Endowed professorships are crucial to the mission of higher education because the funding allocated for these positions exists in perpetuity and allows a university to recruit and retain the best faculty researchers and clinicians for years to come. As the university embarks on its third century the professorships add further momentum to many efforts underway to strengthen the university’s teaching cross-disciplinary research initiatives patient-centered care and medical enterprise.

“Investing these funds into our academic medical enterprise represents a forward stride toward our goal of being D.C.’s premier health care organization” said Barbara L. Bass vice president for health affairs Walter A. Bloedorn Chair of Administrative Medicine dean of SMHS and CEO of the GW Medical Faculty Associates. “The recognition of the GW academic medical enterprise as a national health care destination will fundamentally be built on clinical performance excellence but it is renowned faculty who bring transformative clinical expertise discovery and innovation that will fuel that success. These endowed professorships are evidence of our commitment to that future.”

Bass also emphasized the importance of the hard work of SMHS and MFA faculty to strengthen GW Hospital over many years and help it grow as a successful health care organization which has now enabled the university to have the funding to reinvest in the future of its academic and clinical mission especially through the new professorships.

The university and MFA leadership recently created a new modern partnership affiliation with UHS that also supports the creation of centers of excellence and the advancement of the medical enterprise as a high-performing academic medical center committed to research education patient care and community service.

Over the coming months the university will begin searches in collaboration with relevant deans and other school leadership for the faculty who will be appointed to the professorships. The first professorship appointee in SMHS will be announced this fall.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhLW1hZy5jb20vbmV3cy9mcmVlLWNvbGxlZ2UtaW4tYW1lcmljYS1pcy1hLWJhZC1pZGVhLS1qdXN0LWxvb2stYXQtZXVyb3BlLTY5NjE4Lmh0bWw_cHJpbnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Free College In America Is A Bad Idea. Just Look at Europe,"September 9 2022

Even fans of student debt relief will admit it doesn't solve the core problem of crushing higher education costs. For that debt-forgiveness proponents such as Bernie Sanders and education economist Sue Dynarski have a long-term solution: free college.

They have a point. If we're going to burden the tax base to pay for the nation's college students through debt forgiveness we might as well be more upfront about it. Just be prepared for the result. Free college will not only worsen the quality of American universities currently the best in the world and mean fewer resources for students it would also be more regressive and would deepen inequality compared with a system where students pay or take out debt.

Free college like universal health care is one of those things that exist in Europe that Americans love to idealize. In Europe most universities are public and France Germany Sweden and Scotland don’t charge fees to domestic students. But like just health care nothing is ever really free. Free college is paid for with taxpayer money which is always in short supply and that often results in lower-quality services in the form of over-crowded classrooms and crumbling buildings. It's popular to make fun of the plush facilities on American college campuses but a lot of the spending on students is valuable. More spending per student is one big reason why British and American universities dominate global rankings.

Limited resources also means rationing. And when capacity is limited places tend to go to students from higher-income families. They get better secondary educations and appear more qualified when it comes to admissions in competitive schools. In Germany about three-quarters of adult college graduates send their children to college while only 25% of adults without degrees have children in college.

The figure below shows the share of the population (25 and above) with a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) in different countries between 2016 and 2020. The countries that offer free or very cheap college have much lower graduation rates than the higher-cost US and UK.

Perhaps lower graduation rates would be fine since it seems like too many people go to college anyway. But free college doesn’t mean more vocational training. Germany briefly charged fees starting in 2006. But after lots of protest it returned to free college in 2014. Once they removed fees more students went to university and this reduced the number of students who enrolled in vocational schools.

The United Kingdom also offers a useful case study. Until 1998 college was free for English students. At first fees were modest but they now exceed £9000 per year (typically about $12000 — more than many state schools in the US) which are financed with loans that graduates pay back based on their income when they start work. One study found that charging fees resulted in more students attending university; it narrowed the participation gap between students from high- and low-income families and more resources were spent per student.

Meanwhile Scotland went tuition-free for Scottish and European (until the UK left the EU) students. A study by Lucy Hunter Blackburn of the University of Edinburgh estimates that the result was many low-income Scottish students ended up taking on more debt than their English peers because they had to get loans to pay for living expenses. Up until 2016 English students from low-income families could also get grants to pay for living expenses (now living expenses are also covered by loans) while Scottish students had to take out loans or rely on their families. She concludes that free tuition in Scotland amounted to a £20 million (at the time $30.9 million) transfer from low-income to high-income families. And while enrollment of students from low-income families increased all over the UK in the last 25 years England experienced more growth despite charging fees.

Based on the European experience free college is not the solution to financing education if we want a system that reduces inequality and leaves students with little debt.

Free college might look different in the US because of the extensive network of private institutions. We could limit free tuition to public universities and let private schools such as Harvard and smaller liberal arts colleges continue to charge fees. In some ways that would make the education system better — odds are many private colleges especially the low-value ones would close because fewer students would be willing to pay fees when they have a free option.

The only private universities that would survive would have to offer very high value or have very large endowments. But fewer colleges leaves fewer spots for students overall and even more competition for the few places available at high-quality state schools — especially for students who are barely qualifying now but end up benefiting from their education through much higher lifetime earnings. When it comes to completion and getting some value out of education Dynarski points out that the quality of the school is what matters. Yet free college undermines quality because it means less spending per student and doesn’t necessarily lead to higher completion rates .

Free college at public universities risks further entrenching inequality by worsening what is already a two-tier system in US higher education. Inequality will only be exacerbated if the high cost of free public education means there’s less government money to subsidize loans for lower-income students who want to attend good quality private schools that still charge tuition.

One of the benefits of university for students from low-income families is the exposure they get to students from more privileged backgrounds . A more disparate two-tier system undermines that process and further segregates our economy and society.

The US higher education system which charges fees and offers need-based aid and loans is clunky and often wasteful. There needs to be more scrutiny over needless spending tuition inflation how loans are structured and schools that offer no value.

But the current system largely works and is better than most other countries. The overwhelming majority of people who graduate from college are rewarded with higher lifetime earnings and many Americans do go to college. Moving to free college would mean students would still have lots of debt to pay their living expenses and the quality of public education would decline. The better solution is to reform student loans and keep university fees.

La compañía catalana de moda propiedad del grupo Paz Torras ha retornado ya a las cifras de antes de la pandemia gracias apoyada en la expansión de puntos de venta la internacionalización y el canal online según ha explicado Angelo Ruggieri consejero delegado de la empresa a Modaes.

“Son momentos de cambios y aunque venga una crisis hay que afrontarla con curiosidad y optimismo” opina Ruggieri. Para hacer frente a la escalada de costes y las disrupciones de la cadena la empresa ha asumido parcialmente el impacto de la subida de costes que Ruggieri sitúa en torno al 10%.

En los siete primeros meses de 2022 la facturación de la empresa se encuentra un 5% por encima del mismo periodo de antes de la pandemia y un 30% por encima de enero y julio de 2021. En 2019 la compañía facturó cerca de diez millones de euros.

La recuperación de las ventas de System Action se ha dado principalmente por las nuevas aperturas. El grupo cuenta actualmente con una red de veintidós establecimientos. El último de ellos acaba de abrir esta semana en Francia y se trata de su primera tienda fuera de España.

System Action ha trasladado parcialmente el incremento de costes al cliente

En concreto System Action se ha instalado en un local de doscientos metros cuadrados de superficie en el centro comercial Roques de Toulouse en el sur del país. La es una franquicia y la empresa no descarta abrir nuevos puntos de venta en la región de la mano del mismo socio.

Este es el primer salto internacional con retail de System Action. La empresa también opera en México de la mano de El Palacio de Hierro donde está presente en cinco centros del grupo. A medio plazo la compañía tiene previsto continuar expandiendo su presencia en Latinoamérica.

System Action también ha emprendido su expansión internacional a través del multimarca canal donde hasta este año no estaba presente. Para cierre de 2022 la empresa tiene como objetivo alcanzar los doscientos puntos de venta multimarca repartidos entre España Portugal y Andorra y para 2023 superar los trescientos puntos de venta y entrar en Italia.

“La clave para funcionar en el multimarca es identificar los puntos de venta más adecuados al perfil de tu empresa algo que muchas empresas no han conseguido” sostiene Ruggieri. A medio plazo la compañía se ha propuesto alcanzar los mil puntos de venta en este canal.

La compañía prevé finalizar el año con doscientos puntos de venta multimarca

En España System Action ha continuado expandiendo su presencia en El Corte Inglés con la apertura de dos corners en las últimas semanas y la puesta en marcha de otros dos para cierre de año. Con estos nuevos puntos de venta la compañía elevará su presencia a dieciséis corners en el grupo de grandes almacenes.

El tercer pilar para la empresa es el ecommerce. System Action puso en marcha este canal hace tres años cuando pasó a manos de Paz Torras. El objetivo de la compañía para 2022 es que el online cope el 15% del total de las ventas.

Para ello además de su ecommerce System Action ha entrado en marketplaces internacionales como Zalando La Redoute y About You “que nos sirven también de palanca para nuestra expansión internacional” añade Ruggieri. Hasta ahora el canal online del grupo generaba el 95% de sus ventas en España.

System Action ha entrado en ‘marketplaces’ como Zalando La Redoutte y About You

Fundada en 1986 con una tienda en Portal d’Àngel en Barcelona System Action pasó en 2018 a manos del grupo Paz Torras que compró la marca y la unidad productiva de la empresa después de que cuatro de las sociedades Systemaction Esfera Verde 4 Barras y Braunver encararan un proceso de liquidación.

Within a generation a combination of rising global temperatures and humidity will make outdoor working increasingly difficult and even life-threatening with significant implications not only for the health of the agricultural labor force but also for food production in major economies such as China India Brazil and the U.S.

Agriculture ranks highest for both current and future heat stress risks in Verisk Maplecroft’s new Industry Risk Analytics dataset which measures 52 different risks for 198 countries across 80 industries. The data reveals that heat stress already poses an extreme risk to agriculture in 20 countries.

That number rises to 64 under future climate conditions according to a Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 worst case high-emissions scenario modelling 2°C of warming above pre-industrial levels by mid-century. RCP is a greenhouse gas concentration (not emissions) trajectory adopted by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

“Heat stress” – a measure of temperature levels and the impact of climate on working outdoors – already poses an “extreme risk” in 20 countries especially agricultural giant India according to a risk analysis report carried out by British company Verisk Maplecroft.

As a result of global warming the frequency of heat waves has only increased in recent years. High temperatures risk significantly impacting global agriculture leading to failed or disrupted harvests.

The report is based on the assumption that global temperatures increase by 2℃ compared to the pre-industrial area by 2045. In this scenario 64 countries that account for 71% of global food production could be affected by this extreme heat stress. This includes all of the world’s major food producers such as China Brazil and the United States.

“If emissions remain unchecked and temperatures continue to rise extreme disruptions to global food supply chains will become increasingly common” said Will Nichols the company's Head of Climate and Resilience. ""This will push prices even higher strain economies and drive millions towards hunger.”

Burning bread baskets

Currently India which represented 12% of world food production in 2020 is the only major country currently in the “extreme risk” category for heat stress. If temperatures rise too high this may affect the country’s ability to put workers into the fields.

“In May 2022 a heatwave scorched India’s harvests prompting Delhi to impose a ban on wheat exports. The decision was a blow to the international community who had looked to India – the world’s second-largest wheat producer – to fill the supply gap caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine” the researchers note.

The report warns that the outlook will “only grow bleaker” in the coming years with heat stress set to pose an extreme risk to agriculture in over 30% of countries. 90% of the worst affected are in Africa. Ghana the world’s second-largest producer of coca is under extreme threat from high temperatures.

In Europe the Balkan nation Montenegro where agriculture represents 6.4% of GDP and 7.2% of the workforce has leapt 75 places in the list of countries at risk from future changes in the climate the sharpest deterioration recorded by any country in the researcher's dataset.

Verisk Maplecroft warns that the impact of high temperatures could have a vast array of secondary impacts especially in developing countries.

“Countries facing falling incomes and dwindling food supplies will struggle to mitigate climate impacts or address issues like poverty that not only upend the operating environment but could also trigger humanitarian crises political unrest or even conflict” the report concludes.",,,,,,

It’s not something that Verizon really promotes all that much. But if you head over to their plans page you’ll see at the very bottom that there is a student discount. Or you can check out this page here.

The student discount isn’t a lot it’s up to $25 per month on Unlimited mobile plans. And you can also save $10 per month on Verizon Fios. Like I said it’s not a lot but as a college student every little bit helps.

What is Verizon’s Student Discount?

Verizon offers a discount for students on their phone plan. You can save $10 with one line or $25 with two lines. And this is available on the 5G Do More 5G Play More and 5G Get More plans. Of course the taxes and fees are still added on afterwards.

This means that the 5G Start plan is not included which is their cheapest one. But the smart thing here would be to get the 5G Play More plan even if you have just one line. That brings it down to the same price as the 5G Start plan but you get the Disney+ bundle included (which is about to get a big price increase too). You’ll also get 5G UW which can be very useful in college in a densely packed city.

Over with Verizon Fios you can save up to $10 per month with a student discount. Again not a huge discount but still worthwhile. Fios is one of the best ISPs out there maybe not in terms of customer service but in terms of speeds. They are really the only ones offering Gigabit fiber but it’s mostly only on the east coast.

How can I get this student discount?

Obviously only students can get this discount. Hence the name. But the way it works is the following:

First confirm your discount eligibility by clicking the “Get Started” button on this page.

Next after you have verified your eligibility you will continue back to Verizon to register your account and choose your plan.

The final step is after you have activated your services Verizon will email you to let you know you’re all set. And that’s it.

Can I get this discount if I’m already a customer?

According to Verizon yes you can. Existing Fios customers who have not used a promotional or discount offer in the past 12 months and are eligible for the student discount can enroll in this discounted plan.

Existing mobile customers who qualify can also enroll in the discount plan.

Who exactly is qualified for this discount?

The term “student discount” can be pretty vague as some other places include teachers and staff in that term. But with Verizon any student who is actively enrolled in an accredited institution of higher education are eligible for the student discount. You will need to maintain your active student status and have to verify your eligibility every 12 months.

This includes undergraduate and graduate students. There’s also no limit on how long you can get this discount. Some companies will put a limit of four years to get this student discount – like Spotify for example. But that is not the case for Verizon.

So should you get the Student Discount at Verizon?

If you are eligible and can verify that you are a student then it is definitely worth it to get the student discount. While $10 on a single line and $25 on two lines may not seem like a big discount since plans start at $70/month it is. Especially if you jump to the 5G Play More plan and get this discount then you’re paying the same price and getting Disney+ ESPN+ and Hulu for free. Which isn’t too shabby.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9oZXJlLWFyZS10aGUtaXBob25lLTE0LWRlYWxzLWZyb20tYXQtdC10LW1vYmlsZS1hbmQtdmVyaXpvbi1hcy1wcmVvcmRlcnMtYmVnaW4tMTE2NjI3MjAyNDLSAYABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFya2V0d2F0Y2guY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS9oZXJlLWFyZS10aGUtaXBob25lLTE0LWRlYWxzLWZyb20tYXQtdC10LW1vYmlsZS1hbmQtdmVyaXpvbi1hcy1wcmVvcmRlcnMtYmVnaW4tMTE2NjI3MjAyNDI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here are the iPhone 14 deals from AT&T T-Mobile and Verizon as preorders begin,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/here-are-the-iphone-14-deals-from-at-t-t-mobile-and-verizon-as-preorders-begin-11662720242 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9oZXJlLWFyZS10aGUtaXBob25lLTE0LWRlYWxzLWZyb20tYXQtdC10LW1vYmlsZS1hbmQtdmVyaXpvbi1hcy1wcmVvcmRlcnMtYmVnaW4tMTE2NjI3MjAyNDLSAYABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFya2V0d2F0Y2guY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS9oZXJlLWFyZS10aGUtaXBob25lLTE0LWRlYWxzLWZyb20tYXQtdC10LW1vYmlsZS1hbmQtdmVyaXpvbi1hcy1wcmVvcmRlcnMtYmVnaW4tMTE2NjI3MjAyNDI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

It's not who you might expect.,"Vertex’s market capitalization of $75 billion now surpasses that of Moderna  which has dipped to $56 billion as prospects for COVID vaccine sales have waned. Vertex’s value has also shot past Biogen long the local leader whose current market cap of $31 billion is half what it was when the FDA approved of its controversial Alzheimer’s drug that Medicare declined to cover .

While many biotech stocks have struggled this year amid a broader economic downturn Vertex Pharmaceuticals has risen 65 percent since its most recent low in October 2021. And the 33-year-old firm is now Boston’s most valuable biotech by a mile.

The brightest star in Boston’s rapidly growing biotech scene isn’t a flashy new player but rather one of its longest standing companies.

“Biogen has been sort of the top dog in the Boston biotech community for many years” said John Maraganore former chief executive of Cambridge-based Alnylam Pharmaceuticals. “But now we see Vertex rising to the top appropriate to their name.”

How the company got there by dominating the drug market for a single long-untreatable disease is one of the city’s biggest biotech success stories and it’s not over yet.

Incredibly Vertex has built its empire by selling just four life-changing drugs for cystic fibrosis a rare genetic condition that predominantly affects the lungs and digestive system. Thanks to those pills patients are breathing easier feeling more energetic and starting to live longer too.

The company has become increasingly attractive to investors partly due to its higher-than-expected sales of those drugs which have little competition on the horizon and its plans to expand into other diseases.

“Vertex has really benefited from a more skittish risk-averse biotech market right now and it’s been one of those unique kinds of ‘Goldilocks’ stocks that has growth but also has security” said Paul Matteis a biotechnology analyst at the investment firm Stifel.

Over the past year Vertex has unveiled promising data on a non-addictive painkiller that could provide an alternative to opioids; a gene-editing therapy developed with Cambridge-based CRISPR Therapeutics that could heal broken blood cells in sickle cell disease; and a stem cell-derived therapy that could become a long-awaited cure for type 1 diabetes.

“The company is at a new inflection point today” Vertex chief executive Dr. Reshma Kewalramani said in an interview. “What we want to do is replicate what we’ve done in cystic fibrosis and transform if not cure multiple additional diseases.”

Dr. Reshma Kewalramani became chief executive of Vertex Pharmaceuticals in April 2020 making her the first female leader of a large biotech company and currently the most valuable biotech in Boston. David L. Ryan/Globe Staff

Although many of these programs were underway before Kewalramani became CEO in April 2020 she kept pushing them forward during the pandemic.

The firm has doubled down on cutting-edge medicines with the opening of a new lab and manufacturing facility in the Seaport dedicated to cell and gene therapies. About 3100 of the company’s 4300 employees are based in Boston and more jobs are on the way with a planned expansion in the Seaport.

Fueling this growth are the firm’s highly effective and highly profitable pills for cystic fibrosis which made $7.57 billion in sales last year. The vast majority of that came from a single drug Trikafta which was approved in 2019 and costs $311500 per patient a year. Total revenues could rise to $8.8 billion this year and higher still in years to come as Trikafta becomes available in more countries and for younger ages.

Although Vertex has been a big name in Boston’s biotech community for decades the firm’s current level of success was never guaranteed.

“I always viewed them as Genzyme’s and Biogen’s little brother” said Kenneth Kaitin a professor of medicine and drug industry expert at Tufts University School of Medicine. While Genzyme pioneered treatments for rare diseases and Biogen for multiple sclerosis “there was poor Vertex looking to play with the big boys but they had no marketed products” he added.

In the two decades after it was founded by Joshua Boger in 1989 Vertex burned through billions of dollars trying to make medicines for cancer viral infections and other diseases. The company’s big break came in 2011 with the approval of Incivek a hepatitis C treatment. Sales quickly topped $1 billion in 2012 before evaporating over the next two years when a competitor launched a more effective drug.

“We got out-innovated” said Stuart A. Arbuckle the chief commercial and operations officer. “That was a painful lesson to learn.”

Stuart A. Arbuckle chief commercial and operations officer of Vertex Pharmaceuticals. David L. Ryan/Globe Staff

Vertex used its profits from Incivek to avoid a similar failure in cystic fibrosis. The company’s first drug for the disease Kalydeco was approved in 2012 to help stabilize the specific proteins called CFTR that are crucial for clearing mucus from the airways but are broken or missing in people with cystic fibrosis.

That first pill only worked for about 4 percent of patients. Over the next eight years under CEO Jeffrey Leiden the company rolled out three more drugs culminating with Trikafta which stabilizes CFTR proteins in more than 90 percent of patients with cystic fibrosis.

Dr. John P. Clancy vice president of clinical research for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation said Vertex’s medicines reduce the amount of time patients spend on daily care such as clearing mucus that accumulates to dangerous levels in their airways. “It is fundamentally changing how their life is lived.”

Vertex has yet another medicine for the disease in advanced clinical studies that could wrap up by early 2023. Kewalramani thinks the new pill could improve the health of patients even more dramatically than Trikafta could be taken once a day instead of twice a day and could potentially boost Vertex’s profits even further.

The company’s commitment to improving its cystic fibrosis drugs has made it hard for potential competitors including AbbVie whose experimental pills have underperformed compared to Trikafta. If Vertex’s new drug proves better still the company will strengthen its effective monopoly on treatments for the disease.

The firm’s success hasn’t come without criticism. Vertex has faced some resistance from European health care systems over its expensive drug prices. And the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review or ICER a drug-pricing watchdog concluded that Trikafta would need to be discounted at least 73 percent — or cost no more than $85500 a year — to be considered cost-effective.

“Nobody can regret the innovation that has led to the current lineup of cystic fibrosis drugs” said ICER president Dr. Steve Pearson. “But even when you have a drug that’s really much better than what patients had before it’s possible for the drug to be overpriced.”

A recent survey of Fortune 500 companies underscores just how profitable Vertex’s drugs are. The firm reaped about $798000 per employee in 2020 making it the most profitable company by that measure in the drug industry and the sixth most profitable overall — beating out tech and finance giants Alphabet Apple Meta Microsoft and Visa.

An unusually small salesforce which numbers just 16 people in the US helps keep Vertex’s costs down — in part because they are the only game in town for cystic fibrosis. An estimated 83000 people have the disease in the company’s primary markets of Australia Canada Europe and the US.

Kewalramani said Vertex is working on a one-time gene therapy for the disease. But technical challenges that have stumped scientists for decades may not be resolved any time soon. Meanwhile Vertex is partnering with Moderna on an inhalable mRNA therapy that would help patients who are lacking CFTR altogether make the crucial protein in their lungs. A clinical trial of that approach could begin next year.

Vertex is also in the early stages of developing several different stem-cell-derived therapies for type 1 diabetes that it acquired by purchasing two startups Semma Therapeutics and ViaCyte.

Dr. David Altshuler chief scientific officer of Vertex Pharmaceuticals. David L. Ryan/Globe Staff

These stem cell therapies as well as the company’s CRISPR gene-editing work on genetic blood diseases and muscular dystrophies mark a radically new direction for Vertex which has long focused on developing pill-based drugs designed by chemists. But chief scientific officer Dr. David Altshuler said these new programs fit squarely in Vertex’s wheelhouse of working on diseases where the root cause is well understood and there’s a clear strategy for how to treat it.

Biotech analysts say it is hard to point to any single experimental therapy as the main driver of the company’s stock performance.

“The vast majority of large-cap biotech companies end up getting built on one or two really big drug franchises and then have difficulty in reinventing themselves once competition emerges” Matteis the Stifel analyst said.

But Vertex is trying hard to buck that trend. Last year the company spent more than 40 percent of its revenue on research and development of new drugs — far more than most pharma companies.

And since the company is sitting on about $9.3 billion in cash investors are wondering if Vertex will acquire another firm. Kewalramani acknowledged that “there are good values to be had” but that any acquisitions would need to align with the firm’s research strategy.

“The one thing I can tell you is Vertex is going to grow” Kewalramani said. “And headquarters for us is right here in Boston.”

Boston’s most valuable biotech? It’s not who you might expect

The brightest star in Boston’s rapidly growing biotech scene isn’t a flashy new player but rather one of its longest standing companies.

While many biotech stocks have struggled this year amid a broader economic downturn Vertex Pharmaceuticals has risen 65 percent since its most recent low in October 2021. And the 33-year-old firm is now Boston’s most valuable biotech by a mile.

Payment processor Visa Inc. said late Saturday that it plans to start separately categorizing sales at gun shops.

It's a major win for gun control advocates who say it will help better track suspicious surges of gun sales that could be a prelude to a mass shooting. But gun rights advocates have argued that step would unfairly segregate legal gun sales when most sales do not lead to mass shootings.

Visa said it would adopt the International Organization for Standardization's new merchant code for gun sales which was announced on Friday. Until Friday gun store sales were considered ""general merchandise.""

Visa's adoption is significant as the largest payment network and will likely add pressure for Mastercard and American Express to adopt the code as well.

Gun control advocates had gotten significant wins on this front in recent weeks. New York City officials and pension funds had pressured the ISO and banks to adopt this code.

Two of the country's largest public pension funds in California and New York are pressing the country's largest credit card firms to establish sales codes specifically for firearm-related sales that could flag suspicious purchases or more easily trace how guns and ammo are sold.

Merchant Category Codes now exist for almost every kind of purchase including those made at supermarkets clothing stores coffee shops and many other retailers.

""When you buy an airline ticket or pay for your groceries your credit card company has a special code for those retailers. It's just common sense that we have the same policies in place for gun and ammunition stores"" said New York City Mayor Eric Adams a former police captain who blames the proliferation of guns for his city's deadly violence.

The city's comptroller Brad Lander said it made moral and financial sense as a tool to push back against gun violence.

""Unfortunately the credit card companies have failed to support this simple practical potentially lifesaving tool. The time has come for them to do so"" Lander said recently before Visa's announcement.

Landers is a trustee of the New York City Employees' Retirement System Teachers' Retirement System and Board of Education Retirement System -- which together own 667200 shares in American Express valued at approximately $92.49 million; 1.1 million shares in MasterCard valued at approximately $347.59 million; and 1.85 million shares in Visa valued at approximately $363.86 million.

In letters to the companies the New York pensions funds joined by the California State Teachers' Retirement System sought support for such a move saying the companies have a responsibility to prohibit the use of their networks for what public officials deemed illegal activity.

""Failing to do so can result in regulatory reputational and litigation risks that may harm long-term shareholder value"" the letters asserted.

Over the years public pension funds have used their extensive investment portfolios to influence public policy and the market place.

The California teacher's fund the second largest pension fund in the country has long taken aim on the gun industry. It has divested its holdings from gun manufacturers and has sought to persuade some retailers from selling guns.

Four years ago the teacher's fund made guns a key initiative. It called for background checks and called on retailers ""monitor irregularities at the point of sale to record all firearm sales to audit firearms inventory on a regular basis and to proactively assist law enforcement.""

The pension funds argue that creating a merchant category code for standalone firearm and ammunition stores could aid in the battle against gun violence.

In letters to the credit card companies a pattern of purchases could flag suspicious activity.

Officials said that a week before the mass shooting at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando Florida where 49 people died after a shooter opened fire in 2016 the assailant used credit cards to purchase more than $26000 worth of guns and ammunition including purchases at a stand-alone gun retailer.

Associated Press writer Bobby Calvan in New York contributed to this report.

Unistream recorded a fivefold jump in money transfers from Russia in July compared with a year earlier after Western Union Co the world's largest money transfer firm left Russia Kairzhan Kudyarov said in an interview with Reuters.

The issue of access to money became acute for many Russians after Western Union Co left Russia or their cards issued by U.S. payment card firms Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc stopped working outside Russia soon after Moscow sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24.

""Migration has also had an impact as some Russian citizens have left the country a significant part of them to neighbouring countries"" Kudyarov said.

Scores of Russian citizens left the country after Feb. 24 for various reasons including the fear of being recruited to the army or because their companies relocated amid unprecedented financial and economic sanctions that the West imposed to punish Moscow for its actions in Ukraine.

Unistream saw a spike in money transfers to Armenia and Georgia in recent months Kudyarov said adding that there was a rise in transfers to almost all CIS countries since late February.

""Our customer flows have started to change and the profile of the sender has changed. Previously the main clients were foreign migrant workers but now Russian citizens are also actively sending remittances"" Kudyarov said.

NEW COUNTRIES

Unistream which made 800 million roubles ($13.27 million) in profit in the first half of this year launched money transfers to Czech Republic and Germany in August and plans to expand its geographic footprint.

Unistream clients can now make instant money transfers to 10 countries outside the CIS including the UK Greece Cyprus Italy and Israel and wire the equivalent of up to $10000 per month without the need to open an account.

Kudyarov said the bank was in talks with counterparts in Turkey to launch money transfers as soon as in September and was looking for new partners in Kazakhstan to transfer money to cards there.

Unistream was also in talks with African countries and India to make money transfers there.

""With the departure of Western Union the far abroad has been left entirely without remittance systems a niche that is vacant"" Kudyarov said.

The company is acquiring several hundred acres of land off the Coastal Road near Gales Point Manatee in an area called White Ridge Farms.

Sustainable Development Minister Orlando Habet confirmed that the matter was raised during the weekly Cabinet meeting and senior officials within the John Briceño administration have made a collective policy decision that no surface mining including strip open pit or mountain top shall be permitted near Gales Point Village.

“As you know this has been out there that the company Vulcan has an interest in acquiring I don’t know if they have acquired it’s a private deal with White Ridge Farms to purchase some farms that White Ridge owns in the Manatee area and all the information we got was that they were interested in doing some mining in that area” Habet said speaking on News 5 television

“As you know we have had the voices out there saying that it is not a good type of investment to make especially in terms of the ecosystems within that area. We have villagers the community from Gales Point Manatee going against it. But to be fair our team along with I think the Minerals Unit from the Ministry of Natural Resources met with the people from Vulcan to hear them out but whilst we had our Cabinet meeting the Cabinet decided as the executive arm of government that they will not be entertaining any type of development that has to do with any type of mining at this time” he added.

Habet said the Cabinet’s decision” really was that it will not support any project development in Gales Point Manatee that will involve any type of mining given the fact that there is this extremely sensitive nature of the area.

“Of course from my ministry we are looking at the biodiversity and all the benefits from the watershed certainly that immense ecological value and ecological systems that surround the entire area. So it was not prudent for us to engage in that type of development” he told television viewers.

Last month Kenrick Williams the chief executive officer in the Ministry of Sustainable Development predicted that the government would not support moves by Vulcan Materials Company the US’s largest producer of construction aggregates primarily crushed stone sand and gravel and a major producer of other construction materials including asphalt and ready-mixed concrete.

Her personal stick-and-poke style stems from her family roots.

“My family is Mennonite” she says “and so they do a lot of hand stitching hand sewing stuff.”

It’s amazing what she can do with thin black lines of permanent ink.

On top of being a skilled artist she’s in the business of changing the industry — after recognizing unfair labor practices within traditional tattoo parlors where owners get the lion’s share of the the revenue and workers make a small percentage Blum organized with other artists and formed Thorns Tattoo a worker-owned studio.

It’s deeper than aesthetics too. Blume has used her craft to support social justice causes by organizing tattoo fundraisers donating the proceeds to folks on the front lines.

For our second episode of ‘Permanent Behavior: Getting Tatted In The Bay’ we talk to Sophia Blum a.k.a. Pio Poke about manually making her mark as well as the importance of workers’ rights and bodily autonomy.









Read the episode transcript here.

Below are lightly edited excerpts of my conversation with Sophia Blum a.k.a. Pio Poke.

Sophia Blum: The origins of tattooing is pretty pretty far back. Stick-and-poke feels like more of a modern iteration but non-mechanical or non-machine tattoos have been around for as long as like humans have been wanting to mark their bodies.

Pendarvis Harshaw: Hand poke or stick-and-poke that style in my head is tied to prison tatts or even punk tatts…

Sophia: Sure sure

Pen: You know like am I wrong for having that assumption or connection?

Sophia: That’s definitely true. I mean it’s like the simplest form you know? So it’s just accessible. You know all you need is like a needle or something pointy and some ink. The first tattoos that I ever made were you know like a BIC pen and a sewing needle. But that was like when I was like 14 before I knew what I was doing at all

Pen: Ahh. That sounds aggressive!

Sophia: It’s not something I would recommend for anybody to do. But I feel like that you know like the prison tattoo or the punk tattoo it’s just kind of what you have. It’s a DIY kind of experience. But there’s also just so many simple ways you can make a machine too. I think that simplicity is kind of a part of all of that. But in terms of indigenous tattooing practices like those have been around so much longer and there’s like a wide range of tools and specific practices that go into that.

Pen: Perusing your Instagram I see that you have a lot of influence from like nature. What’s your connection to flowers?

Sophia: I’ve been a florist for ten years now. Nope! Twelve years. Oh time is a wild thing! I just have an affinity for plants and flowers and I’m from the Bay — I grew up like hiking backpacking all around California.

I get all my color work done with the flower side of things so I don’t really bring it into like tattoos or like my art. Working with flowers has taught me everything that I know about design and composition. It’s just sculptural but it’s also ephemeral. Like it doesn’t last. You’re working with something that is temporary and I’ll draw that parallel with tattoos pretty often.

Pen: You said something that stuck with me: Tattoos essentially don’t last forever. When I think of tattoos I think like that’s probably the most permanent form of art that I can think of — what lasts longer than tattoos you know? And so why? Why are they impermanent?

Sophia: To me I think of it in the opposite sense. Most art lasts so much longer than your body does. Like a painting lasts for hundreds of years. A piece of sculpture will last way longer than the artist itself will last. A photograph lasts for a really long time. But you only last as long as you last. Tattooing is essentially just like decorating your vessel and that can end at any moment. So to me tattooing is one of the most temporary art forms.

A highlight of Ellen Shade’s summer this year is the week she spent at Wabtec Corp.’s camp for middle-school-age girls in Erie Pennsylvania.

Called “Wabtec Girls Who STEAM” the camp is aimed at middle-school-age girls who have an interest in the so-called STEM subjects — science technology engineering and math. The camp is a partnership between Wabtec which has a locomotive manufacturing plant in Erie and the campus of Penn State Behrend located near Erie and where most of the five days of camp activities take place.

A sophomore studying mechanical engineering at Penn State Behrend Shade spent camp week as a STEAM volunteer helping dozens of campers and the Wabtec interns who mentor them find their way around the Behrend campus. She also made sure everyone had the supplies and other necessities to complete their assigned activities.

Shade attended the very same camp when she was a seventh-grader and thought it would be a “fun experience” to help the younger girls have as influential an experience as she had at that age. Her STEAM camp experience definitely played a role in her decision to attend Penn State Behrend as well as to major in mechanical engineering.

“I got to see Behrend at a young age and I just fell in love with the campus there” Shade says. “The camp also showed me that engineering — and all the applications that come along with it — can be really fun.”

Wabtec Girls Who STEAM is one of 20 such programs of its kind in the world Wabtec officials say. The programs began under GE and Wabtec got involved in the camp in Erie when the company merged with GE Transportation in 2019.

“A ton of research and studies have shown that around middle school is when girls start to lose interest in things like science engineering and all of the STEM classes. For whatever reason they feel like they just can’t do it” says Kerry Hamilton Wabtec’s senior director of human resources. “So the idea behind the camp was to get a group of girls together and show them they can do it and that science technology and engineering can be super fun — and a career.”

Partnering with local universities like Penn State Behrend is key because it gets the younger students onto campus and into science labs to see the practical applications of STEM subjects Hamilton says.

Wabtec Corp.

Wabtec also enlists its female college interns — who are studying engineering at the Behrend campus — to serve as the campers’ mentors. Two mentors are assigned to each group of about a dozen girls who then learn about topics such as robotics electronic circuits chemistry structures and energy.

“The interns spend the entire week with the girls” says Hamilton. “They show the girls around campus and say ‘Hey this is what I’m studying in school and you can do it too.’ Our interns love being involved.”

The camps are limited to 50 students a year. Although the programming is aimed at middle-school girls the camp is open to boys. Students are selected for attendance after filling out an application and writing a brief essay on why they want to go to camp. Wabtec officials visit local schools to help raise awareness of the camp which is free to attend.

Summer 2022 was the first in-person camp since the pandemic. The last two years’ camps were held virtually which allowed Wabtec to offer the program to international students Hamilton says.

Still there’s nothing like being on the Penn State Behrend campus. Campers spend the first four days in the labs and classrooms where activities are led by female staff from Wabtec and the university.

“We get them into the chemistry lab where they get to design their own lip gloss” says Nicole Cillessen an engineering technical leader at Wabtec and one of the camp’s leaders. “That activity is very popular with the girls. Then we take them into the plastics lab where they make packaging for their lip gloss and learn about plastics used in packaging.”

The campers also learn some engineering design concepts; get to make model cars powered by rubber bands and then modified for battery power; and are exposed to computer applications in 3D design.

“Another thing we did this year was create color-changing slime — kids love slime” says Cillessen. “We talked about properties of light and how things change colors when exposed to it. We also had them design their own roller-coaster which brings up the engineering design concepts they’re learning about.”

Wabtec Corp.

The camp goes by the acronym STEAM — instead of STEM — because it adds an art element to the study of science technology engineering and math. The students use their artistic skills to design the color and packaging of the lip gloss as well as in creating their CAD 3D designs. The purpose of adding art to STEM classes is to help energize the students’ creativity.

“It shows [the students] that going into engineering is not all math and science focused” says Cillessen. “You’ll get exposed to all of these things [like art] because you need to have that creative element to find success in these careers.”

The camp’s curriculum evolves each year with Wabtec engineers adding or removing activities to ensure the content remains relevant and to accommodate changes in technology.

On the last day of camp the girls take a tour of Wabtec’s facilities. This year’s visit included a look inside a real locomotive. The camp concludes with a graduation ceremony with the girls’ parents invited to attend.

Because the camp is just a decade old and the campers are in the 12-to-13-year age range the company has yet to hire any female engineers who’ve attended Wabtec Girls Who STEAM. Still the company views the camp as an investment in its future.

“It’s the long game that we’re playing” says Hamilton. “It’s important from a diversity perspective to have more women in the field.”

About 19% of Wabtec’s engineers are female and the company has a goal to increase that percentage as part of its diversity equity and inclusion initiatives Hamilton says.

“It’s really important to inspire these girls to want to pursue these STEM degrees and careers” adds Cillessen. “What we’re hoping for is to have at least a few of them have that spark that moment they’ll reflect back on someday and say ‘This is why I decided to continue down that path why I decided to become an engineer.’”

To help light that spark into a flame Hamilton Cillessen and other Wabtec officials are exploring ways to stay engaged with former campers to encourage their continued interest in pursuing STEM studies. One possibility under consideration is a gathering of STEAM camp alumnae.

“It’s a challenge but that’s the next level of what we hope to do” says Hamilton. “We’re looking for that sweet spot to keep everyone engaged. We get so excited when we meet a college student who says ‘Hey I was a participant in the STEAM camp.’”

A college student like Shade who remembers her camp experience fondly. Having just started her sophomore year she hasn’t yet determined what she’ll do with her engineering degree after graduation.

“Maybe I’ll want to work at a larger company” Shade says.

According to a message on their Facebook page MacKenzie Pizza Pub and Grill made this announcement on Wednesday September 7th.

The popular restaurant has been serving Bismarck Mandan for nearly 10 years. In the message to their fans MacKenzie River Pizza Grill and Pub said they could no longer maintain the level of service to their customers because of the limited labor available in the Bismarck Mandan area (limited labor or is it the fact that nobody wants to work anymore?).

They went on to thank their loyal customers over the years and especially the ones who stuck with them during the pandemic.

MacKenzie River originally left this message on their Facebook page stating they would be closing temporarily while they gather and train a new staff. The post on Facebook certainly looked as though the restaurant would open again. This was posted on August 18th.

I guess the challenges of trying to find new employees were just too much. I've asked this question before and I'll say it again. ""What are people doing for money these days?"" Is everybody making their money from YouTube and TikTok videos?

One thing for sure I would be extremely leery of opening up a new restaurant or any business for that matter where you need employees these days. It's quite clear that nobody wants to work for their money anymore. Kind of a sad state of affairs.

Kicking off the proceedings Alan Bergman chairman The Walt Disney Studios reflected on the 13-year history of D23 Expo—as well as the evolution of the Studios group. “That [first] year none of the iconic studios you’ll hear from today were part of the company” Bergman explained. “It was just Disney Animation Disney Live Action and Pixar. We announced the Marvel acquisition just before our first Expo in 2009. Then three years later we added Lucasfilm and in 2019 20th Century Studios. I’ve been at Disney for 26 years so it’s been incredibly exciting to welcome each of them to our Studio family. And like Disney and Pixar each of these studios has a phenomenal legacy of storytelling.”

Bergman was then joined by Kathleen Kennedy president Lucasfilm; Kevin Feige producer and president Marvel Studios; and James Cameron director of 20th Century Studios’ upcoming Avatar: The Way of Water to showcase a veritable smorgasbord of incredible content to come.

LUCASFILM

Andor

Kennedy first welcomed Andor series star and executive producer Diego Luna as well as costars Genevieve O’Reilly Kyle Soller and Adria Arjona to tease the upcoming 24-episode spy thriller. The era featured in Andor—the five years before the events of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story—is filled with danger deception and intrigue where Cassian Andor will embark on the path that is destined to turn him into a rebel hero. Much to the delight of the assembled crowd Luna and his costars unveiled a final trailer for the series.

The series presents Star Wars from a different perspective focusing on everyday people whose lives are affected by the Empire. The decisions they make have real consequences and the stakes for them—and the galaxy—couldn’t be higher. The series debuts with three episodes on Disney+ on September 21.

Willow

Next Kennedy welcomed Warwick Davis to the stage to talk about the new Disney+ series Willow—a live-action fantasy-adventure series that returns to the world of Andowyne that we first met in the 1988 feature film (directed by Ron Howard and produced by Disney Legend George Lucas). Davis was then joined by series stars Joanne Whalley (Sorsha) Ruby Cruz (Kit) Erin Kellyman (Jade) Ellie Bamber (Dove) Dempsey Bryk (Airk) Amar Chadha-Patel (Boorman) and Tony Revolori (Graydon)—and as a special surprise Christian Slater was also welcomed to stage as a member of the ensemble cast! We were also privy to a new trailer for the series:

Filoni delighted the audience by sharing an official trailer for the shorts.

All six shorts will debut October 26 on Disney+.

Ahsoka

And speaking of a certain popular Jedi Filoni shared with Hall D23 how much the character of Ahsoka means to him—having crafted her story since her 2008 debut in the animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars through her live-action debut in The Mandalorian. Ahsoka is a new live-action series heading to Disney+ starring Rosario Dawson in the title role. Disney Legend Jon Favreau joined Filoni on stage to talk about the series and shared first-look images with the assembled fans.

Finally Kennedy concluded the Lucasfilm portion of the proceedings by sharing info about one more title: Indiana Jones 5! She welcomed the film’s director James Mangold who shared some incredible details and first-look footage from the upcoming fifth installment of the immensely popular Indiana Jones franchise—which opens in theaters June 30 2023. And then much to the utter delight of Hall D23 Kennedy and Mangold were joined on stage by the film’s stars Harrison Ford and Phoebe Waller-Bridge! “Thank you for making these films such an incredible experience for all of us” said an emotional Ford. “I’m very proud to say that this one is fantastic and [Waller-Bridge] is one of the reasons.”

Ford continued “Indiana Jones movies are about fantasy and mystery but they’re also about heart… I’m really really happy that we have a really human story to tell as well as a movie that will kick your [butt].”

MARVEL STUDIOS

Feige reflecting on his multiple sojourns to D23 Expos over the years spoke of watching the performances created just the event from around the worlds of Disney: “I’ve always been a little jealous” Feige admitted. “Why can’t we get our own musical number?” That kicked off an incredible high-energy performance of the fan-favorite “I Could Do This All Day” from the show-within-a-show Rogers: The Musical featured in last year’s Disney+ Original series Hawkeye! The number boasting 22 performers was accompanied by a six-piece rhythm section led by composer and conductor Marc Shaiman who wrote the song for the episode.

As someone who has been labeled many things over the years being a ""Disney adult"" is not one I'm not ashamed of.

""Disney adult"" is a name used (often negatively) to describe grown-up fans of the company. We older fans have seen our fair share of animosity and scrutiny over the years often being called ""weird"" or too old to love Disney.

But why? Being passionate about something is part of the human experience.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

At 35 years old the thing I'm passionate about just happens to be Disney.

My love of Disney began as a child

My father's military service gave me the opportunity to see the world and one of my first childhood memories revolves around the Walt Disney Company.

Growing up I consumed a lot of Disney's animated content — ""The Little Mermaid"" is still my favorite movie — but when I was around 6 years old I had my first experience with its theme parks.

I'll never forget my first visit to Disneyland Paris which was called Euro Disney at the time.

I was enamored by the larger-than-life architecture and colorful sights. I loved seeing real-life versions of my favorite animated characters in person.

The joy of being part of a collective social experience was life-altering for me.

Disney makes me happy. Sarah Gilliland

Fast-forward to my middle- and high-school years when my school made the requisite choir and band trips to the US parks — I was hooked.

I was fortunate enough to continue visiting Walt Disney World in college through my participation in my university's marching band.

Even now my one regret during my college years was not participating in the Disney College Program where students can work at the parks and live nearby.

A mutual love of Disney also helped bring me closer to my husband and kids

I've been to Disney World with my family many times over the years. Sarah Gilliland

After college when I made the decision to marry my husband and I inadvertently discovered each other's love for Disney.

Before we got engaged we talked about important things like where we wanted to live and if we both wanted kids. But our mutual love of Disney never came up until our first year of marriage when we planned a trip.

We'd had no idea the other enjoyed the parks so much.

In years since we've made several trips to the parks both with and without our three kids. We've also cruised on three of the five Disney Cruise Line ships.

We are for all intents and purposes a Disney family too.

There's no need to judge my passion for Disney

My ""Disney adult"" label is one I wear with pride.

I have learned not to take life too seriously because of it. And it's a wonderful reminder to my kids to savor the fun stuff and that life is too short to grow up too fast.

You don't have to understand my love of Disney. After all it's OK to be passionate and excited about something that other people may not understand.

But I could do without the harsh judgments.

This fundamental need to justify something we love is an unnecessary burden. We should be OK with our differences and support one another in the enjoyment of those different aspects of life.

After all you never know when that zany ""Disney adult"" in your life might come in handy to help you plan your next Disney vacation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2Rpc25leTEwMC10aGUtZXhoaWJpdGlvbi10by1pbW1lcnNlLWd1ZXN0cy13b3JsZHdpZGUtaW4tdGhlLW1hZ2ljLW9mLWRpc25leS0zMDE2MjE1NjYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Disney100: The Exhibition to Immerse Guests Worldwide in the Magic of Disney,"The Exhibition which celebrates Disney 100 Years of Wonder launches a World Tour at Philadelphia's Franklin Institute on February 18 2023 with next stops announced including Chicago IL Kansas City MO and Munich Germany

WBD,Warner Bros Discovery,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vdGJpdmlzaW9uLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzA5L3dhcm5lci1icm9zLWRpc2NvdmVyeS1maXJpbmctdXAtdGhpcmQtcGFydHktZGlzdHJpYnV0aW9uLWFzLWZhc3QtcHVzaC1lbWVyZ2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warner Bros. Discovery 'firing up' third-party distribution as FAST push emerges,"Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) is “firing up” its third-party distribution efforts and exploring a push into FAST channels as it looks to increase revenues.

WBD is in the midst of a vast restructuring and cost-cutting exercise following the $43bn merger between Discovery and WarnerMedia but the company’s CFO chief financial officer Gunnar Wiedenfels defended programming cuts while also pointing to untapped potential on library sales.

WarnerMedia had slashed its third-party content sales over recent years in order to feed content into streamer HBO Max but CEO David Zaslav said earlier this year that he wanted a return to international sales.

Wiedenfels whose company owns shows ranging from House Of The Dragon and Succession to Scooby-Doo Doom Patrol and MythBusters told the Bank of America Media Communications and Entertainment Conference that expanded distribution strategy is now in play.

“I think the opportunity is enormous” he said when asked about the potential of third-party licensing. “I almost view this as a Boeing 747 flying on one engine and we’re firing up the other three. There is so much opportunity.”

TBI understands that while WarnerMedia had reduced content distribution in recent years deals were still available but fewer in number and Wiedenfels admitted that returning to the process “doesn’t happen overnight”.

He added that WBD possessed “the ability to get the best return on every dollar of content spend” and has “a ton of content that’s been sitting idly for just purely principal reasons – we’re firing this up.”

Wiedenfels said there has been “a lot of demand a lot of interest… across all of the distribution windows. And I think this is going to start flowing through. It doesn’t happen overnight of course. But we’re open for business as [CEO] David [Zaslav] said.”

Content cuts & FAST moves

The CFO also addressed high profile cuts to movies such as the decision to write off Batgirl despite $90m having already being spent on the film saying some coverage had been “blown out of proportion”.

“We’re a creative industry and one of the elements of creativity is that there are judgements and differences in views on what the potential of a certain piece of IP might be” he continued pointing to new Warner Bros film chiefs Pam Abdy and Mike De Luca as “forming their creative views and assessments.”

He added: “My team has helped them by providing financial data points to the extent possible and a framework to assess the potential from a purely financial perspective.”

WBD has also previously revealed plans to expand into FAST channels and the company’s CFO admitted that area of business offered more potential to squeeze revenue from IP.

“The number one priority is getting this combined SVOD product [HBO Max and Discovery+] out there with the established tiered structure of completely ad free and an ad-lite tier.” he said adding: “We have so much content and… there is a segment no doubt in pretty much every market that’s not going to be willing to pay.

“You could argue we’re participating in that market through a licensing deal with other players but there’s always going to be an abundance of content and we’re convinced that there’s a place for us to play here. Again the first priority is to get that SVOD product launched. But in the spirit of utilising the content across as many platforms and offerings as possible FAST is certainly a very interesting area to play in.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmliYy5vcmcvaWJjLWRhaWx5L3dhcm5lci1icm9zLWRpc2NvdmVyeXMtZGF2ZS1kdXZhbGwtb24tbWFuYWdpbmctbWVyZ2VyLXRlY2gtY2hhbGxlbmdlcy85MDI3LmFydGljbGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warner Bros. Discovery's Dave Duvall on managing merger tech challenges,"Dave Duvall Chief Information Officer at Warner Bros. Discovery spelt out some of the challenges and opportunities facing the newly merged company in an IBC Conference session yesterday.

Duvall is responsible for IT services at Warner Bros. Discovery which completed its $43 billion merger in April. The media giant’s portfolio spans Discovery Channel Warner Bros. Entertainment CNN HBO Eurosport BT Sport Cartoon Network; streaming services Discovery+ and HBO Max; and franchises like Batman Succession Harry Potter and Game of Thrones.

Duvall said Warner Bros. Discovery’s biggest focus was to “really bring us together as one team and one company”.

From a technology point of view he said that he was focusing on “the most impactful and largest areas that we want to make an impact on in the first year”. He explained that the company is looking at areas of overlap between the legacy Warner Bros and Discovery businesses where it can standardise procedures and find “common ground”.

He cited playout technologies. “We’re definitely on a standardisation push: How can we align our platforms around the world and bring those together? We have north of 850 distributed linear feeds within the combined portfolio.” He also picked out collaboration technologies such as email meeting and chat platforms.

Duvall addressed recently announced plans to bring together HBO Max and Discovery+ as one OTT platform. “The plan is do that around the world. We’re going to start in the US as early as next summer progressing sequentially to LatAm at the end of ‘23 EMEA early ‘24 and APAC as well in ‘24”

He said a key challenge was incorporating live offerings such as sport within a combined OTT platform. “Live is still very intensive from a human capital perspective. It takes a lot of teams and operations to pull that off” he said.

Asked what keeps him awake at night Duvall cited the threat of piracy. He spoke of the millions of dollars invested in the new HBO series of House of the Dragon. “You do not want that programme leaking in a way that undercuts the big moment that it’s been building to for years… For me it’s the cyber and content protection lens that is the trickiest.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyb2FkYmFuZHR2bmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8wOS9zY2FsZS1hLWRyaXZlci13aXRoaW4td2FybmVyLWJyb3MtZGlzY292ZXJ5LXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktdGVhbXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scale a driver within Warner Bros.

Discovery suffers another setback. Talks with producer Dan Lin to head DC Films collapsed because of Lin’s own production company Rideback. Kim Masters says she’s skeptical because “If you want to run DC and they want you to run DC those things are the kinds of things that get solved.” Matt Belloni takes a deeper dive into this issue with her.

Another setback for Warner Bros. Discovery

Kim: This problem does not go away for Warner Bros. Discovery. They're constantly compared to Marvel. They think they can find a Kevin Feige which is very hard to do and then you have the Zack Snyder fans. And they still haven't solved it.

Matt: Awkwardly they've got a guy who is currently running DC Walter Hamada who is watching this search play out from the perch of his job. I don't know why this has all been so tough for them. It's a very difficult job and in this day and age when you start negotiating with someone these things tend to leak out but it's back to the drawing board at this point.

Warner’s search continues

Matt: Warner Bros. Discovery is cash strapped. They don't want to overpay and Dan Lin has a lot of projects set up all over town. As a producer of “The Lego” movies buying his company would have been very expensive but the alternative now is that they have a very public search to happen again.

The added element of diversity

Matt: Warner Bros. has a lot of white male executives and they have more than the previous version of this company had. So with Dan Lin you had a person of color who would have stepped into this role and replaced Walter Ramada who was also a person of color. If they're going to try to find an executive now I think the pressure will be on for some diversity in that role.

“How many people are in the kitchen with this guy?”

Kim: There was maybe a Zaslav’s effect here. He hires Mike De Luca and Pam Abdi to run the film studio. Then it's Alan Horne a consultant on the film studio Terry Press who's a veteran marketing executive and Oscar campaigner and John Goldwyn a producer and former executive at Paramount long ago.

From what I understand he hires them and he doesn't necessarily listen to any of them. So there may be people starting to feel like “Maybe this won't be so fun.”

The DC job goes beyond film

Matt: They want someone to be a brand owner where it's film television consumer products games everything DC so that does go outside of the film studio.

Kim: I don't even know who the dream candidate is at this point.





The might of a company like Disney

Kim: Thousands of fans are gathering for their D23 conference sort of their Disney Con. Disney is offering a lot of perks. If you're a Disney+ subscriber and you buy two rides on a Disney cruise you get two more for free; you might get early access to a theme park; you might get merchandise opportunities.

This is Disney showing what a multifaceted company can do and trying to create something beyond what an Amazon can provide.

“Amazon doesn't have theme parks yet.”

Matt: No they don't. But it is a replication of the Prime model where if you are an Amazon Prime customer you get their video product for free you get discounts at Whole Foods.

There are other perks there and Disney is looking at their assets and [saying] “Wait a second. We're the Walt Disney Company. We are so much bigger than the streaming service. We have these theme parks that our fans love. We have cruises We've got all of this other stuff.” And it really is smart to mobilize that fandom and then just like Amazon did you slowly raise the price of those perks. It makes perfect sense.

Disney’s metaverse plan

Matt: This is also part of the metaverse strategy for Disney where they're trying to use Disney+ as this interface where someday you will have a Disney avatar and you will interact with other Disney fans buy things maybe go to a virtual theme park. All of this can be done through the Disney+ app and they're starting right now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpYW50ZnJlYWtpbnJvYm90LmNvbS9lbnQvbGVzbGllLWdyYWNlLWJhdGdpcmwtcmV0dXJuLWRlY2xpbmVkLWV4Y2x1c2l2ZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exclusive: Leslie Grace Offered To Return As Batgirl But Declined,"According to our sources Leslie Grace was asked to return as Batgirl in other DCEU movies but declined.

By Nathan Kamal |

Film and television projects get canceled all the time but few of them have the impact and press coverage as Batgirl. The now-shelved Leslie Grace Batgirl movie was abruptly canceled by Warner Bros. Discovery earlier this month triggering an avalanche of protest outcry questions and ultimately even more cancelations. According to our trusted and proven sources Leslie Grace has actually been approached by Warner Bros. Discovery to continue as Batgirl in other DCEU projects and has said “no.” In fact it seems that Leslie Grace’s refusal to return to the role of Barbara Gordon was pretty emphatic and the actress is extremely angry at Warner Bros. Discovery pretty understandably.

Leslie Grace was to star as the title character in Batgirl which was developed as a project to be released directly on HBO Max. This was in line with the general direction of DC Films the subsidiary of Warner Bros. Pictures which in turn became a subsidiary of the newly formed Warner Bros. Discovery in April. Prior to the merger of WarnerMedia and Discovery Inc. DC Films was increasingly relying on the popular HBO Max platform for new releases; streaming DCEU shows like Peacemaker and Harley Quinn were better received and more popular than big theatrical releases had been so it made sense for the Leslie Grace Batgirl movie to land there.

However incoming Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav has a different vision for the company. His recently announced ten-year plan is focused on theatrical release films and he has promised to save the company $3 billion in costs which coincidentally seems to involve the firing of Warner Bros executives who preceded him and the cancelation of projects like the Leslie Grace Batgirl in which he was not involved.

It is entirely possible that the firestorm of negative press around the cancelation of the Leslie Grace Batgirl movie is causing Warner Bros. Discovery to do some damage control and see if they can still retain her as an actor. As many pointed out abruptly canceling the first superhero movie that starred a female Latin actor (and was directed by filmmakers of Moroccan descent) was not a good look diversity-wise particularly when other projects starring incredibly problematic leads were still planned for release.



Trying to get Leslie Grace back as Batgirl in a supporting role in some other character’s movie is a real PR Hail Mary and it does not seem as though it succeeded. It is very understandable that Leslie Grace would not want to keep working with Warner Bros. Discovery after they canceled her first starring feature film (and only her second film overall). The direction that Warner Bros. Discovery is going to go is very much in doubt now and it feels likely that if it tried to cast a different actor as Batgirl for at least the foreseeable future it would get the company in public perception hot water all over again. In its eagerness to save a few bucks on the Leslie Grace Batgirl movie they might have just burned themselves from using the character at all."

The first half of 2022 saw India being the second-highest methane emitter in the world. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that is almost 84 times more potent in warming the atmosphere than carbon dioxide. According to data that Kayrros SAS analyzed from images that the Sentinel-5P satellite sent about 78 out of 82 units of methane released in India during the first six months of 2022 were primarily from landfills livestock agriculture and sewage. These toxic emissions from open-air landfills are not only adding to the problem of global warming but are also becoming an increasing health hazard for people living near the dumps. These people are mostly from lower-income groups living in the slums with little to no means to move to another location or change anything about their current situation. The problem does not lie with the landfills per se but with India’s waste management system.

Deficiencies in India’s Waste Management System

Organic waste that decomposes without the presence of oxygen produces methane. According to Bloomberg in Indian landfills about 60% of the waste is organic such as leftover food peelings of vegetables livestock manure etc. However the lack of segregation of organic material at the source and the failure to use the waste for composting is a massive setback in solid waste.

India generates “62 million tonnes of municipal solid waste (MSW) annually.” Out of the 43 million tonnes of MSW collected about 31 million tonnes end up in landfills while only 12 million tonnes undergo treatment. This is an abysmally small percentage.

An important player in the waste segregation process is the informally trained waste or rag pickers coming from the nearby slums. These workers however do not receive proper instructions on how to separate the trash into different categories. In fact they often end up burning the waste in open areas for warmth on cold nights causing pollution according to Recycling Magazine. Moreover these workers do not have adequate gear to protect themselves from hazardous and unsanitary materials exposing them to skin and blood infections.

According to The New York Times “a few hundred thousand people earn income” from waste picking in Delhi. The government therefore doesn’t restrict the informal recycling sector from operating in fear of political backlash from them.

The lack of publicly available bins poorly covered garbage trucks and widespread littering by citizens only adds to the problem. According to Recycling Magazine the government introduced solid waste management rules in 2016 which focused on recovery reuse and recycling. However there has been no proper enforcement of the guidelines to date.

Consequences of Improper Waste Management

One of the most infamous dumps is the Ghazipur dump near New Delhi spanning an area larger than what the Taj Mahal covers. On March 22 2022 the Ghazipur dump leaked an estimated 2.17 metric tonnes of methane in an hour according to Bloomberg. Besides causing fires pollution and landslides the landfill is also a breeding ground for tuberculosis and dengue.

In an interview with Bloomberg Owais a citizen living close to Ghazipur said “Most of us have health problems. There’s no government health center in our community and many people don’t realize that pollution from the dump is what is causing health problems.”

The Deonar landfill in Mumbai India is Asia’s largest dumping ground – the size of 268 football fields. Nine thousand metric tonnes of waste ends here daily but the litter neither undergoes segregation nor processing. The stench and smoke from the garbage are the cause of many heart and respiratory diseases in people living in the nearby slums.

According to the Tata Institute of Social Science there is a high case of malnutrition and tuberculosis among nearby residents. Their life expectancy is around 40 compared to the average urban life expectancy of 73-74. Farha Shaikh a 19-year-old waste picker in Deonar stated in an interview with BBC that “Hunger will kill us if not illness.”

The Centre for Science and Environment in Delhi released a study in 2020 which concluded that there are 3159 garbage dumps in India holding 800 million tonnes of waste. The sizes of these rubbish mountains are only increasing with time with no concrete plans of converting them into sanitary landfills anytime soon.

The Efforts to Improve India’s Waste Management System

In 2019 the government submitted a report that listed recommendations for Solid Waste Management (SWM) in India. Some of the key recommendations were converting landfills into parks installing more Waste to Compost plants in the country and formalizing the informal recycling sector. In 2021 the government submitted a report containing the actions taken on those recommendations. One significant progress made by the government was an improvement in the door-to-door collection of garbage and processing the solid waste.

A report that NITI Aayog and the Centre for Science and Environment released in December 2021 highlighted successes in improving India’s waste management system.

Three cities have “adopted a ‘zero-landfill model’ of development” which focuses on reducing the volume of waste through recovery and recycling thus eliminating the need for new landfills The Print reported. One of the cities Ambikapur has pulled off 100% collection segregation and treatment of waste while another city in Maharashtra achieved a 100% rate of collecting and processing sanitary waste. Using solar power and radio frequency technology to collect and treat garbage is also proving to be a success in some Indian cities.

Although there have been recent developments and improvements more source segregation and awareness campaigns could further improve India’s waste management system.

A new report released Thursday puts a spotlight on Massachusetts’s solid waste problem and urges the state to take action.

The report which was put together by Zero Waste Massachusetts a coalition of environmental and consumer rights groups found that about 40% of waste that ends up in landfill incinerators or as litter is made of materials that could be recycled or composted.

These materials include glass and metal containers leaves and yard waste recyclable paper cardboard and paperboard certain plastic containers wood waste and tires.

This is happening despite the fact that the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) banned the disposal of these materials in 1990.

Beyond breaking the law the report said burning waste causes air pollution and landfills can leak and release toxic chemicals into the surrounding groundwater.

Landfills are also only a temporary solution. According to environmental non-profit Keep Massachusetts Beautiful the state is down to just six landfills all of which are on track to be full by 2030.

Zero Waste Massachusetts looked at four case studies where communities took action to enforce waste disposal bans and came up with a list of recommendations for actions MassDEP can take to curb this problem.

“It is evident from these case studies that instituting waste bans is not enough” the coalition wrote in the report.

“If the bans are to be successful they must be followed with rigorous enforcement robust and continuous public education campaigns and public infrastructure for reducing reusing recycling and composting.”

Here’s what the coalition recommended for fixing our waste disposal problem:

Hold waste haulers responsible by requiring haulers to inspect trash bins and issue warnings and penalties.

Devote more resources to waste ban inspections including hiring more waste ban inspectors so that MassDEP can issue noncompliance orders to transfer stations and solid waste facilities when necessary.

Empower waste ban inspectors to dole out financial penalties high enough to cause behavioral change.

Make every municipality in Massachusetts offer and require waste stream separation between trash recyclables and compost.

Mandate the use of clear trash bags to help enforce the waste bans.

Educate the public on the problem and dangers of improper waste disposal.

Reduce the amount of banned materials that haulers can legally dump in solid waste facilities.

Make waste ban enforcement information readily available and transparent to all.

“There are many environmental problems that are incredibly complicated to solve but this is straightforward” Elizabeth Saunders of Clean Water Action one of the Zero Waste Massachusetts organizations told State House News Service Thursday.

“We could drastically reduce waste in Massachusetts by doing the basics – enforcing the long-established DEP waste bans.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbGNpdGl6ZW4ub3JnL2VuL2NvbnRlbnQvd2FzdGUtcGlja2luZy1waWNrZXJzLWxhZ29zLWhlYWx0aC13ZWxsLWJlaW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What You Should Know About the Life of a Waste Picker in Lagos,"By Olanrewaju Dada Lecturer Department of Urban and Regional Planning Olabisi Onabanjo University Ago-Iwoye Nigeria.

Lagos — Nigeria’s economic hub with a population of more than 15 million — generates an estimated 12000 metric tonnes of waste daily which comes to about 4.3 million tonnes of waste annually. This ends up on the streets and in the city’s four officially designated landfills.

These sites support thousands of people who search through what’s discarded for materials with resale value. Our survey of two landfill sites discovered a total of about 2800 waste pickers — men and women.

Most landfills have buy-back centres where the waste pickers sell recyclables such as metal glass plastic and paper. We observed that the subsistence incomes of waste pickers fluctuated daily depending on the volume of recyclable waste delivered to the landfill its quality and varying prices.

The daily average income of the street waste pickers was N2075 (US$4.99) while that of the landfill waste pickers was N5530 (US$13.30). Though this average income is higher than the poverty line the work and the environment are hazardous and its value is not fully appreciated.

Waste pickers often work without protective gear unassisted and without access to primary care or first aid and employment regulations. They operate on the margins of or outside the formal process of managing solid waste but play vital roles especially in reuse recycling and cost recovery.

They work in unsheltered environments and are unprotected from severe heat sun rain and cold weather. These conditions have been linked with cardiovascular disorders. Likewise exposure to dust micro-organisms and microbial toxins can result in chronic respiratory diseases skin problems and gastrointestinal illnesses.

Research on waste pickers has tended to focus on the health risks of their occupation. Our study confirmed that Lagos waste pickers were exposed to occupational health hazards but also aimed to reveal more about their well-being and their own perspectives.

The findings may help waste management authorities to make landfills a more dignified working environment that sustains waste pickers’ livelihoods without jeopardising their well-being.

Occupational Hazards of Waste Picking

For our research we interviewed 125 waste pickers in Olusosun landfill and 27 in Solous landfill. Olusosun is situated in Ojota Kosofe Local Government Area and Solous in Egbeda Alimosho Local Government Area of Lagos state.

We established that waste picking in landfills was mostly done by younger people: 88% of our respondents were aged between 18 and 45. The collection of recyclable materials and items was mostly done by men while the sorting was mostly by women.

They operated at the landfill because of the abundance and concentration of waste there. In fact 66% lived at the dumpsite. The majority worked seven days a week. The average number of years they had spent doing this work was seven.

Most of the waste pickers we spoke to had experienced illnesses or injuries. Body pain bruises and fatigue were the most frequently mentioned conditions. Most waste pickers had bruises or scars on their hands arms and feet mainly from cuts or piercings during sorting.

Other illnesses and injuries were caused by inappropriate posture and prolonged work hours. Many had sore or itchy eyes caused by exposure to smoke from burning garbage and to other hazards like methane gas sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide.

The people in our study didn’t use personal protective equipment or go for regular medical checks.

When we asked about their subjective feelings we found that the waste pickers were very dissatisfied with their unhealthy working conditions the extreme poverty they lived in and the stigmatisation they experienced. Many used alcohol and drugs. Most said they were distressed by their work.

They experienced discrimination prejudice and social rejection.

Yet with low education levels — 61% were illiterate — they could not find other work. They settled for waste picking as a last resort to earn a living.

Value of Waste Pickers

Nigerian authorities don’t fully appreciate the beneficial role of waste pickers. These workers contribute to environmental sustainability by reducing wastes in dumpsites and providing material for recycling and reuse. But they are never considered when waste management policies are designed.

Waste pickers should be recognised in waste management policies and their well-being should be taken seriously. Waste management authorities NGOs and multinational organisations must ensure that potable water sanitary facilities and clinics are provided at landfills. Waste pickers must be allowed to use them free of charge as is the case in Brazil.

In addition waste pickers should be encouraged to develop workplace health frameworks to alleviate accidents and risks. Training to build their capacity and expand their skills giving them other work opportunities could reduce their dissatisfaction.

There is also a need for investment in regular occupational health and safety training through public/private partnerships. Waste pickers should be provided with personal protective equipment and monitored to ensure proper use. Non-compliance should be penalised.

Lastly the rights of waste pickers must be protected. They should not be stigmatised but treated as essential to waste management.

Garbage monitors soon will be traversing our neighborhoods digging into our bins to make sure we are properly sorting our trash recyclables and compost—and putting each in the correct bin. We’ll know who the trash cops are because they’ll be wearing yellow vests the City of Alameda said in a Facebook post on Thursday September 8.

These “container reviews” ordered by Alameda County Industries (ACI) are now required by state law according to the City’s post. And lest we don’t take the yellow vests seriously there will be consequences. “If [the garbage monitors] find bins with prohibited items (for example if recyclables or food scraps are found in the trash or if plastic or glass are found in the green organics bin) ACI will contact the customer so they can correct the issue going forward” the City warned.

Sorting may seem simple but it’s not always as straightforward as one might think. According to the long multi-colored list provided by Alameda Sorts for example a newspapers go into the blue recyclables bin—unless you spill some food or coffee on them in which case they go in the green compost bin. Pay attention now. Cosmetic containers with residue go in the gray trash bin but empty aerosol hair spray cans go in the blue recyclables bin—residue or not. Hopefully the yellow vests go after more obvious offenses.

Shared trashcans pose challenge for garbage monitors

As might be predicted some people responded to the City’s Facebook post about trash cops with less than full enthusiasm especially when it’s tough to know who to hold accountable for that fruit fly invasion in a shared trash bin. “I often see stuff that doesn’t belong in the compost bin and compostables in the garbage bin shared by five apartments” Priscilla commented. Upon whose door will the yellow vests be knocking if they find a problem? How will they know who actually dumped the errant garbage into the wrong bin? “If someone is recycling trash according to your guidance and then others are sneaking their items to whatever bin then what? Is it still the owner’s responsibility?” asked Dorota. Judging by the number of similar comments tossing trash into other people’s bins is not an uncommon occurrence around town.

Community expresses mixed reactions to trash cops

Some commenters were uncertain—or even skeptical—about the number of items in the blue bins that actually get recycled even after meticulous sorting. “Can you give us the stats on how much of our recyclables are being recycled these days?” Maggie asked. “And do we now need to rinse them clean? I want to be good on this because it’s important but I also want to make sure I’m not wasting effort.” Others expressed similar concerns. “I’ve heard that roughly 80 percent of what goes into the blue recycle can ends up in the landfill anyway” Tahd replied.

Despite the many questions and the few who complained that “Big Brother is watching you” most commenters expressed a desire to deal with our garbage in a responsible way. “Bring it!” Kim wrote. “We are extremely good at our recycling.”

Finally Katie asked what many of us would love to know: “Can we finally get our broken bins replaced?” Good luck with that.

This company is in oil and gas space and jprices for both oil and natural gas look to conitnue to climb. Let’s explore more about this company in this Bull of The Day article.

Description

Talos Energy LLC engages in exploration development and production of oil and natural gas properties. It operates primarily in the Gulf of Mexico and in the shallow waters off the coast of Mexico. Talos Energy LLC formerly known as Stone Energy Corporation is based in Houston Texas..

Earnings History

When I look at a stock the first thing I do is look to see if the company is beating the number. This tells me right away where the market’s expectations have been for the company and how management has communicated to the market. A stock that consistently beats has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved. That is what you want to see.

For TALO I see two beats and two misses of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. That isn’t that great to see but by itself that is not enough to make the company a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The average positive earnings surprise over the course of the last year works out to be 13%.

Earnings Estimates Revisions

The Zacks Rank tells us which stocks are seeing earnings estimates move higher.

Over the last 30 days earning estimates haven’t moved at all for TALO

The full fiscal year 2022 has held still at $4.15 .

Next fiscal year has also held still at $5.15

Positive movement in earnings stock is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Valuation

The valuation for this name is very attractive. I see the forward earnings multiple work out to be less than 5x and that is super cheap for an oil and gas name. Price to bool comes in a 1.7x which is also “super cheap.”

Margins have seen a dramatic increase over the last three quarters.

The operating margin was a negative number three months ago then had a “6” handle. The most recent quarter saw operating margin nealy double to 11.6x

For a government to grant a $16 billion contract to a company with no past performance of similar technology or scope is unimaginable. But that’s precisely what Taiwan’s government did in 2017 when it contracted CSBC Corp to build eight submarines.

As Taiwan cannot make many submarine subsystems such as periscope sonar or propulsion systems the unit price tag of each diesel-electric sub is twice as much as comparable subs and not too far behind that of the U.S. Virginia-class nuclear attack submarine. Worse CSBC conducts little systems engineering and the government does not exercise independent verification and validation (IV&V) to mitigate technological risks. Consequently the Chinese consider the program to be high risk with little chance of success. No wonder China has not protested against France and the U.S. for their assistance to Taiwan’s Indigenous Defense Submarine (IDS) program.

There’s a vast gap between Taiwan and China’s submarine forces. The submarine gap cannot be mended even if Taiwan can build and commission eight new submarines in the next few years.

But does Taiwan need to mend the gap?

The People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) is projected to have 76 submarines of all types by the end of this decade compared to the U.S. Navy’s 66. China’s submarine force like its Rocket Force is the cornerstone of its anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) strategy as stealthy submarines still have an advantage over surface combatants in war. The new PLAN diesel-electric sub Type 039C/D is reportedly very quiet and can pose a significant challenge to surface combatants.

In 2005 a Swedish Gotland-class submarine conducted a series of simulated attacks against the United States’ then newly commissioned Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier battlegroup. The Gotland class was the first submarine in the world with a Stirling engine air-independent propulsion (AIP) system which allows the sub to avoid detection and have an extended endurance for weeks. Throughout the exercise the Gotland launched (simulated) torpedoes multiple times without ever being detected by U.S. anti-submarine warfare (ASW) assets. The episode shows that an advanced submarine can significantly threaten valuable surface warships. If coming to aid Taiwan in a military contingency U.S. Navy war planners will have to consider the PLAN’s newly acquired underwater A2/AD capabilities.

That begs the question of why Taiwan continues to build surface warships with limited ASW capabilities while facing the significant PLAN submarine force. To make matters worse China has had mature anti-ship cruise missile (ASCM) capabilities since the 1960s. The fact that Ukraine sunk the most powerful flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet the Moskva shows that even a small salvo of ASCMs has a high kill ratio.

A Chinese idiom best describes Taiwan’s naval strategy – hitting a stone with an egg. With China’s rapid build-up of its surface combatants and submarines Taiwan’s knee-jerk response to build ships in kind and size does not seem to be the outcome of scrupulous assessment and strategic planning.

From the perspective of asymmetric warfare Taiwan should not compete with the PLAN for more submarines – neither can the island country afford to. To detect and neutralize hostile underwater threats Taiwan’s military can consider deploying SOSUS (Sound Surveillance System) or SURTASS LFA (Surveillance Towed Array Sensor System Low-Frequency Active) around Taiwan’s waters. Both systems use arrays of underwater hydrophones to listen for underwater sounds particularly submarines and can pinpoint the location of underwater threats. As the area to be defended is not expansive the cost will be very affordable. To neutralize PLAN submarines smart naval mines and long-range anti-submarine rockets (ASROC) will be much cheaper and more effective than rival submarines.

Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense (MND) has never publicized China’s underwater activities near Taiwan. Given the PLA’s almost daily warplane incursions into Taiwan’s airspace and PLAN’s surface combatants menacing near Taiwan’s 12 nautical mile territorial sea line it is virtually certain that PLAN submarines have been active near or in Taiwan’s maritime territory for quite some time.

There are two plausible explanations for MND’s deafening silence. First the MND could be afraid of losing face if they announced a PLAN submarine intrusion without any means to neutralize it or at least force it to the surface. Second as Taiwan lacks SOSUS or SURTASS-like hydrophones to detect the presence of hostile submarines the military may be oblivious of the underwater threat. Neither case is palatable.

In 2021 the PLA dispatched 961 sorties of warplanes into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ). Over 17 percent or one in six were Y-8 ASW variants. Given its unusually high frequency presence near Taiwan’s airspace it is likely that submarines from the U.S. Navy Japan Maritime Self Defense Force or other countries may be cruising under Taiwan’s waters. As Taiwan’s four vintage submarines are antiquated and unlikely to retain much fighting power it is also conceivable that the PLA’s Y-8 has been conducting ASW drills with its own submarine forces near Taiwan’s waters. Given that the PLA has yet to mature its ASW capabilities Taiwan’s waters present the best proving ground for the Chinese.

Because any attempt by the PLAN to cross the Taiwan Strait would likely involve an escort by Chinese ASW forces in the air on the surface and underwater these assets will likely make Taiwan’s newly built submarines ineffective. A Taiwanese submarine attacking a group of PLAN surface combatants will essentially embark on a suicide mission because a submarine inevitably reveals its position to the enemy when it launches any torpedoes or missiles. It is difficult if not impossible for the sub to escape the firepower from the enemy’s ASW assets when its location is known. Even if Taiwan’s submarines have the opportunity to launch a few torpedoes without being neutralized they will have to go into hiding immediately. The evasive maneuver would be equivalent to retreating from the battlefield rendering the underwater force ineffectual.

All of this is to say that the cost-effectiveness of having a submarine force to defend Taiwan is questionable at best.

Operational challenges notwithstanding Taiwan’s prospect of building indigenous submarines does not look promising. In addition to lacking experience in designing integrating manufacturing and testing submarines the ambitious plan has been plagued by scandals and mismanagement. Moreover foreign engineers and technicians cannot seem to keep a secret. The 2024 target date for the first sea trial seems unattainable.

To abolish the IDS program completely would be too hard a pill to swallow for Taiwan’s government. But that does not mean the country cannot change course. If the MND is serious about acquiring submarines Taiwan should start by building smaller ones such as those with a displacement of 300-500 tons and gradually migrate to larger submarines to those with 1500-1800 tons. The accumulated engineering and operational experiences are essential to building an effective deterrent. Otherwise Taiwan’s aspiration to create a modern underwater force may prove futile."

WFC,Wells Fargo,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL3dlbGxzLWZhcmdvLWNsb3NlZC1teS1hY2NvdW50LWZvci1iZWluZy1hLXBvcm4tc3Rhci1hbmQtaXRzLXRpbWUtdG8tZmlnaHQtYmFja9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wells Fargo Closed My Account for Being a Porn Star,"I recently learned that the longest relationship in my life was coming to an end. My bank Wells Fargo decided to break up with me via a typed-out letter delivered through the mail.

The plain white envelope marked with nothing more than the Wells Fargo logo may have normally gone unnoticed blending in with junk mail. It was the lack of warning on the envelope that captured my attention. As I opened the letter and began reading confusion took over. The letter stated that after reviewing our relationship in connection with the bank’s responsibilities to manage risk they would be closing my bank accounts. After thirty years together through thick and thin my bank was dumping me because I’m somehow now labeled a risk. While this is not the first time an adult performer or business has been kicked out of a financial institution it was the first time it had happened to me.

The first question that came to mind when reading this strange letter was whether it was fake. After all I’ve never bounced a check I’ve never overdrafted or had any type of issue in the past. There was absolutely nothing in my banking history to warrant my newfound risk factor so I thought maybe the letter was a hoax. Instead of calling the number given in the letter I called the customer service line to be sure it was Wells Fargo that I was speaking with. After a few moments the service representative sadly informed me the letter was real. I patiently waited nearly thirty minutes to finally speak to a representative from what I believed was their risk-assessment team. As the agent went through a long list of identifying information I was told my call was being recorded and monitored. For the first time I proudly repeated the same statement to the rep as she was being recorded on my behalf.

Now that I had the risk agent on the line and she knew she was being recorded it was my opportunity to ask questions. When I asked why my account was being closed the agent mistakenly said it was a random closure. There was nothing random about closing my account after nearly thirty years of service. As I pressed on the rep said it was a business decision by Wells Fargo and it would be final. I asked to speak with a supervisor or a manager only to be cut off and told by the agent that I could speak with a supervisor but they would tell me the same thing! Imagine my anger and frustration. Wells Fargo refused to tell me what reason they had and that was the end of that—or so they thought.

As a union leader this breakup was beginning to feel more like discrimination than a simple business decision. As a performer and content creator I receive deposits from online companies such as OnlyFans. My deposits create a direct link to online platforms where I post and share my adult content. Historically as an adult film actress my checks from production companies would often be the dead giveaway. The company name would automatically notify the teller who was cutting me that hefty check sometimes with the name of the film listed in the subject line. This would cause bank tellers to mistreat us often harassing workers who were simply trying to collect their pay. When we moved over to online work direct deposits took that problem away. We didn’t have the snarling face of an upset underpaid bank employee judging us anymore. While this was a short-term improvement it may be one of the causes of this current problem.

Since millions of people are uploading and selling their content through OnlyFans their parent company name Fenix International has become well-known. This isn’t an issue adult platforms usually face as most fly under the radar with a different business name used to run their day-to-day operations such as payroll. Imagine being able to create a list of every worker on a platform by searching recipients of deposits from Fenix. In one fell swoop a bank like Wells Fargo could identify which of their customers are involved in legal sex work and remove us all.

“ In one fell swoop a bank like Wells Fargo could identify which of their customers are involved in legal sex work and remove us all. ”

Like many people I often use my social media pages as a platform to share issues or even vent. In my sadness and anger I decided to film a video describing what had happened. As tears rolled down my face I told my story. I soon learned that many other members of my adult community had also lost their accounts and received the exact same letter. My story became our story. Dozens of sex people began sharing their banking horror stories involving not only Wells Fargo but other major banks such as Chase Capital One and more. Within the last year it seems as if hundreds of legal sex workers were being flagged and losing their access to banking in the name of “risk assessment.”

The account closures and concerns of potential discrimination made their way to dozens of news outlets showing an outstanding amount of support beyond the sex work community. One such supporter a content creator with 4.9 million followers on TikTok named @TizzyEnt created a video sharing our story to his audience. This video highlighted the fight against our community labeling us spicy content creators—as many do to prevent their videos from being shadowbanned. Even mainstream content creators must censor their words when talking about our industry to protect their accounts. TizzyEnt’s video has been watched over 270000 times on TikTok alone. The amount of support Tizzy pushed toward our cause was so incredible that the conversation transitioned from adult industry workers to everyday people. Men and women alike many Wells Fargo customers shared their dismay with the company over their actions and proclaimed that they would be closing their accounts in solidarity!

As the days went by I waited for word from Wells Fargo. It had been several days since I’d originally spoken with their agents and had been told I would receive a response. Wednesday afternoon a letter arrived in my email that seemed strange. It was from a secure email service connected to Wells Fargo. After verifying its legitimacy I logged into the system to see an update from Wells Fargo. To my shock and surprise the letter was not what I expected. The letter described Wells Fargo as being an inclusive company that recognizes respects and understands differences among all people. They went on to tell me that the freeze had been lifted on my account as of September 7 2022 and they would like to apologize for any inconvenience this had caused. I couldn’t believe my eyes. How was this real life?

My excitement lasted maybe an hour. Shortly thereafter I received a phone call from an unrecognizable number in the Midwest. The voice on the other end informed me that she worked for Derek Flowers the vice president of Wells Fargo. I sent a letter to Mr. Flower’s office about this issue and requested a meeting. This new rep was calling to deliver bad news as she called it. I was told the letter sent to me was a mistake. I was sent that letter from a separate risk-management department that had originally cleared my account for reinstatement but that Mr. Flowers was going to be reversing this decision. When I asked why I was told that because I emailed Mr. Flowers I escalated my complaint. By getting his office involved they did their own “risk assessment” and deemed I was not going to be getting my account back. The man responsible for risk at Wells Fargo had decided I was now a risk when the other Wells Fargo risk-assessment agents cleared my account. How was this even possible?

The adult industry is labeled a high-risk industry causing many banks to not want to do business with us. Usually account removals revolve around actual risk—not assumed risk. This is an issue the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency which regulates banking is aware of. On January 14 2021 the OCC announced its finalized rule to ensure fair access to banking and this could have changed the way that banks are allowed to treat legal sex workers. Adult workers have faced occupational discrimination from the banking industry since Operation Choke Point was put in place. This policy blocking banking access for high-risk accounts affected performers even when those workers didn’t violate banking policies or accounting rules. Performers and adult businesses have famously lost bank accounts from institutions such as Bank of America Citibank PayPal Square and Chase.

“The rule codifies more than a decade of OCC guidance stating that banks should conduct risk assessment of individual customers rather than make broad-based decisions affecting whole categories or classes of customers when provisioning access to services capital and credit” read the OCC ruling.

It continued: “As Comptrollers and staff in previous administrations have made clear in speeches guidance and testimony banks should not terminate services to entire categories of customers without conducting individual risk assessments. It is inconsistent with basic principles of prudent risk management to make decisions based solely on conclusory or categorical assertions of risk without actual analysis. Moreover elected officials should determine what is legal and illegal in our country.”

That ruling was supposed to go into effect on April 1 2021. Instead of it being put into action preventing issues such as mine the ruling was frozen much like my bank accounts. Because a new president took office and a new Comptroller of the Currency was put in charge the matter was set aside until it could be reassessed and implemented. The current comptroller is Michael J. Hsu.

When speaking at the Women in Housing & Finance Public Policy Luncheon Comptroller Hsu stated “Banking rests on trust and trust rests on our values our conception of what is fair and unfair what is right and what is wrong what is acceptable and what is unacceptable. Achieving diversity and inclusion speaks to those values which can build and sustain trust.”

Wells Fargo’s actions do not align with the OCC’s statements. A decision to mass-remove legal sex workers would go against this idea of fair right and acceptable.

The Fair Access Rule which has yet to be reviewed for a final ruling would have codified more than a decade of OCC guidance stating that banks should conduct risk assessments of individual customers when providing access to services capital and credit. The notice from the OCC regarding the hold dated January 28 2021 also states “ The OCC’s long-standing supervisory guidance stating that banks should avoid termination of broad categories of customers without assessing individual risk remains in effect.”

This could mean that Wells Fargo’s assumed action of removing legal sex workers based on their occupation not individual risk goes against current OCC guidelines.

While we search for better access to banking it is clear our battle is headed to legislators. As we search for means to protect our access to safe and fair banking pushing our representatives to fight for our marginalized community is key. As tax-paying workers we deserve protection against the biases of big banks. Credit card giants like Mastercard and Visa have already buckled to pressure in refusing their business to adult companies like Pornhub. Now the banks are focusing on the more vulnerable target: the workers just trying to survive. But I believe our strength has been proven time and time again. The fight for access to fair and safe banking will not end until we are victorious.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50YXBpbnRvLm5ldC90b3ducy9wYXRlcnNvbi9zZWN0aW9ucy9ncmVlbi9hcnRpY2xlcy9wYXRlcnNvbi1oYWJpdGF0LWhvc3RzLWdyb3VuZGJyZWFraW5nLWNlcmVtb255LWZvci1jbGludG9uLXN0cmVldC1wYXJr0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paterson Habitat Hosts Groundbreaking Ceremony For Clinton Street Park,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.tapinto.net/towns/paterson/sections/green/articles/paterson-habitat-hosts-groundbreaking-ceremony-for-clinton-street-park on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50YXBpbnRvLm5ldC90b3ducy9wYXRlcnNvbi9zZWN0aW9ucy9ncmVlbi9hcnRpY2xlcy9wYXRlcnNvbi1oYWJpdGF0LWhvc3RzLWdyb3VuZGJyZWFraW5nLWNlcmVtb255LWZvci1jbGludG9uLXN0cmVldC1wYXJr0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovLzZhYmMuY29tL3BoaWxhZGVscGhpYS1oZXJvLXRocmlsbC1zaG93LXBoaWxseS1wb2xpY2UtcGhpbGxseS1maXJlLWRlcGFydG1lbnQtaGlnaHdheS1wYXRyb2wtbW90b3JjeWNsZS1kcmlsbC10ZWFtLzEyMjIwNDAxL9IBhwFodHRwczovLzZhYmMuY29tL2FtcC9waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEtaGVyby10aHJpbGwtc2hvdy1waGlsbHktcG9saWNlLXBoaWxsbHktZmlyZS1kZXBhcnRtZW50LWhpZ2h3YXktcGF0cm9sLW1vdG9yY3ljbGUtZHJpbGwtdGVhbS8xMjIyMDQwMS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hero Thrill Show returns to help children of Philadelphia police firefighters lost in the line of duty,"Hero Thrill Show returns to help children of Philly police firefighters lost in the line of duty

In the larger of the shifts Merrill teams with offices in Colorado and California have partnered to form a single practice with $1 billion in client assets under management according to an announcement from Sanctuary.

Michael J. Mittman who had been with Merrill’s private wealth unit focused on ultra-wealthy customers in Denver is joining with a traditional brokerage team led by Luke R. McKelvy and William A. Schellenberg in Orange County and Denver. They are calling their new 11-person practice Auric Capital Partners.

“As an independent firm we will now sit on the same side of the table with our clients and have the ability to provide truly objective advice as our only goal is adding value to each client’s financial future” Mittman who spent the last 14 years of his 24-year career at Merrill said in a release.

McKelvy had spent all of his 23-year career at Merrill and said in a statement the team opted to affiliate with a broker-dealer rather than set up their own independent advisory firm because they did not want the additional responsibility of handling compliance and technology “that were outside of our comfort zone.”

Schellenberg started at Coastline Financial a firm that was later expelled from the industry in 1993 and shifted almost four years later to Merrill.

The group includes three other brokers—Jeffrey A. Dewees Arman Melikian and Jay Tamkoc—who are partners in Auric as well as support staff Anna T. Walters Kristen

Freeman Meghan Ide John Kincannon and Francine England.

Sanctuary Wealth which launched in 2018 has around $25 billion assets under management and over 70 partner firms. It is majority owned by Italian asset manager Azimut Group.

In a similar move last week a $600 million-asset Merrill team with offices in California and Georgia left to join independent broker-dealer LPL Financial although its advisors signed with LPL’s nascent employee-broker unit.

Separately a Scottsdale Arizona broker managing $330 million in client assets has left Morgan Stanley to go independent via a fast-growing Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network team on the West Coast a Wells spokeswoman confirmed.

Justin W. Breece a 19-year industry veteran who spent the last decade at Morgan Stanley joined Long Beach California-based TSG Wealth Management on September 1 according to registration records and an announcement on TSG’s website. His practice which includes two client associates and is dubbed Breece Private Wealth Management is opening TSG’s first Arizona office according to TSG’s website.

Breece who ranked 18th on Forbes’ 2022 list of best-in-state wealth advisors had generated roughly $3.4 million in annual revenue at his former firm according to the Wells spokeswoman. The broker did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“It became profoundly apparent that our team needed to control our destiny” Breece had said in a statement in TSG’s announcement.

A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman declined to comment.

Breece started at Crown Capital Advisors in 2003 moved to Merrill Lynch in 2005 and to UBS Wealth Management USA in 2008 before joining Morgan Stanley in 2013 according to his clean BrokerCheck report. Crown Capital was founded by his father R. William Breece Jr. in 1985 according to a previous news report.

TSG partner Allen Schreiber said in a statement that the Breece team’s addition marked an opportunity to extend “complex solutions and white glove service” to the “ever increasing” Phoenix and Scottsdale markets. He also touted TSG’s “ability to offer a higher payout” and said the independent pitch would help them recruit other brokers to grow their practice.

In October 2019 TSG whose 14 advisors had managed $4 billion in client assets joined FiNet after ten years in Wells’ private client group of brokers. The firm has since swelled to 40 advisors (including Breece) managing roughly $6 billion according to the Wells spokeswoman.

Wells has been heavily promoting its independent FiNet channel as well as a registered investment advisor custody option that it says could appeal to breakaways from competitors and restless brokers in its own employee channel.

Around 1200 of Wells’ roughly 12000 brokers are in the FiNet unit."

While Cage’s latest creative renaissance is hopefully still just getting started his current upswing was always going to be pockmarked by its fair share of forgettably solid genre films. We’re talking respectable programmers with compromised scripts cool supporting casts and just enough credibility to stride onto Redbox with their heads held high. The kind of movie whose director tried to get it made for more than a decade before deciding that driving a roadworthy Nicolas Cage vehicle would be preferable to leaving a Rolls-Royce to rust in the garage.

In other words the low-rent but well-intentioned “Butcher’s Crossing” doesn’t feel like a hiccup in Cage’s recent hot streak so much as it does a watchable part of the plan and possibly even a preview of things to come.

Adapted from John Edward Williams’ rough and rangy 1960 novel of the same name — and broadly reflecting the book’s anti-Western efforts to restore a measure of harsh realism to a genre overrun by myths and cowboys — this undercooked tale of a buffalo hunt gone wrong doesn’t have enough meat on its bones to capture the Emersonian flavor of its source material or the vision to reflect that “Red Army” director Gabe Polsky has been trying to bring it to the screen for more than decade. What it does have is a bald and beefy Nicolas Cage spouting manic ideas about the best way to shoot a bison and sporting a thick beard that ironically makes him resemble a VOD-era John Travolta no facial surgery required.

The story begins in 1874 when a fresh-faced Harvard boy named Will Andrews (“The White Lotus” breakout Fred Hechinger) arrives in Kansas in search of a different kind of education. “I hope to find a stronger purpose and more meaning in my life” the minister’s son intones over the movie’s threadbare voiceover track “and to expand my understanding of the world beyond Boston.”

Sure enough there isn’t a single Dunkin’ Donuts to be found in the frontier town where he alights — only a handful of desperate buffalo hunters a beautiful sex worker he’s too bashful to sleep with and a hard-assed hide-trader (“The Sound of Metal” favorite Paul Raci) who’s got no time for a lily-white New England boy with hands as soft as a baby’s cheek. “Young folk always think there’s something to find out” he spits as if every day brings with it some new kid who sees half the country as his own personal Westworld.

This being a threadbare adventure without much time to spare Will is hardly in town five minutes before he finds himself at a bar table across from an ambitious hunter who could use some dumb kid with $500 in his pocket to bankroll his big score. The herds have been scattered by over-hunting and it’s getting harder to make a killing in every sense of the word but that’s no problem for the mad-eyed Miller (Cage).

The hunter is raring to visit a secret valley in the Colorado Rockies where the buffalo run as wide and deep as the sea and he’s more than happy to bring Will and his money along for the trip. Also joining their party: A ruthless hide-skinner named Fred (“The Knick” actor Jeremy Bobb) and a one-armed religious alcoholic named Charley (an almost unrecognizable Xander Berkeley). “Why fear God?” Will asks the latter. “You’ll see” comes the reply.

And so they set out into a forbidding wilderness Hechinger disappearing further into the background with every step as Will practically becomes a passive observer — as if the buffalo hunt were some elaborate ride that he paid to watch from the front row. Of course that’s what he did to some degree but Polsky and Liam Satre-Meloy’s script ices the character out to the point that it can be easy to forget he’s even there.

If there’s something for Will to “find out” in the open West the discovery lies entirely within himself and yet the abject lack of self this film provides him makes it difficult for any of the story to sink deeper than its literal circumstance; flat digital cinematography and some glaringly artificial green screen work further dampen any invitation towards poetry. At least the buffalo look real thanks in large part to Polsky’s collaboration with the animals’ protectors in the Blackfeet Nation.

“Butcher’s Crossing” wouldn’t have been able to exist without that support as Miller does eventually lead his team to the promised land… where his untamed desire to slaughter as much of the herd as he can has a dampening effect on Will’s enthusiasm for the wild. It isn’t long before Miller goes full Colonel Kurtz out there his bloodlust for buffalo growing so intense that his team misses their window to leave the mountains and is forced to hunker down until the spring. Needless to say Will soon discovers a few good reasons to fear God or at least a few good reasons to fear that God doesn’t exist.

There’s some fun to be had in the Brando-like flickers of Cage’s performance but Polsky’s film is too practical and logic-driven to indulge them. Aside from some conspiratorial accusations that result from one rather glorious bout of diarrhea “Butcher’s Crossing” takes a rather grounded approach to the grim price that its hunters pay for their hubris.

Even as Miller and his crew begin to see through the empty promise of money as they reckon with the elements Polsky’s telling doesn’t find the time or texture required for this story to become a richer portrait of man’s place in nature; you can feel his overqualified cast raging against the edges of the frame in search of something more to play which proves frustrating even when it’s fun to watch. It’s almost refreshing to see a Nicolas Cage movie where the supporting cast is skilled enough to deserve better.

The sepia-toned photographs that we see over the opening and closing credits — gruesome images of buffalo skulls piled into pyramids some 30 feet high — provide a more lucidly damning portrait of the damage that white men did to the American West than any of the actual scenes between them. Ditto the end text which celebrates the efforts of indigenous tribes to save the bison population despite not making any time for what the film’s strangely Trumpian language refers to as “one of the greatest conservation stories of all time.” Maybe it was but this surely is not. It’s just another chapter in the ever-expanding book of Nicolas Cage forgettable on the whole even if it leaves you as curious as ever to find out what happens next.

Reggie Fils-Aimé is one of the most recognizable people in gaming. From the moment he made his public debut on the E3 stage in 2004 declaring his intention to kick ass take names and make video games he’s projected a larger-than-life image that gamers responded to. Since leaving Nintendo in 2019 he’s written the best-selling book Disrupting the Game: From the Bronx to the Top of Nintendo been a judge for Rogue Jam a reality show focused on indie games and joined various boards and leadership positions in education and business. Digital Trends had the chance to sit down with Reggie at PAX West to discuss the state of the video games industry and bestow upon him a new title: The President of Video Games.

I want to ask you a hypothetical question. Let’s say you are elected the President of Video Games and it is now time for your annual State of the Union address. In your eyes how is the State of the Industry? What should the priorities be that we focus on?

Well as President of Video Games — and I think I have to take that title and make a business card out of it — but as President of Gaming first we need to recognize that video games today are the predominant form of entertainment in the world. In the world it’s a $200 billion industry much larger than any other form of entertainment. Three billion people play video games I mean just think about that.

It’s a shame that a consumer today that wants a PS5 or an Xbox Series X can’t just go to a retail store and buy it.

So from that vantage point it is a big and vibrant industry. But having said that there are challenges. And to me the challenges are how can this industry continue to innovate and bring great new content? You know I have to say as a player some of the content that I’ve been seeing is a bit more of the same. Now every first-person shooting style game looks the same. Every adventure game looks the same. And I do think this is an industry that likes to follow fads. And I believe we need to challenge ourselves to constantly be creating things that are new things that are provocative things that the player hasn’t seen before. So that’s the first challenge I would put out.

The second challenge I would put out is that while new systems have been launched recently they’re still incredibly difficult to buy. I would challenge the makers of the new platforms to address their supply chain issues. It’s a shame that a consumer today that wants a PS5 or an Xbox Series X can’t just go to a retail store and buy it. And I do think that is limiting the industry. I certainly think that’s in part why some developers are delaying their games because the install base of all of these great new fancy systems isn’t anywhere near where it should be a couple of years into the mission. So there needs to be more of physical hardware out there for consumers to buy and for consumers to then enjoy the latest games on.

And then the third thing I would highlight as the President of Video Games is just how this industry needs to do more to have leadership and heads of studios actually look like the people who play games. So we’re doing [this] interview at PAX as I look around and see who’s playing games. You see a diverse population you see people who have unique life experiences. But regrettably the leadership of this industry kind of all looks the same.

And so that’s how I would summarize the State of the Industry. We’re big we’re dominant. We are an industry that a lot of people participate in. But we need fresher content. We need systems readily available. And we need company leaders to look like the players.

When you came to Nintendo you were a Cornell graduate. You had experienced success with multiple organizations of a similar international scale. You checked all the boxes from a resume standpoint. But unlike most of your peers at that executive level you were a person of color. You were a first-generation kid from the Bronx born to immigrant parents who were caught up in the middle of the coup in Haiti before moving to the United States. How did your background and upbringing influence who you were and how you operate?

I believe that my background helped me be effective. First I am tenacious and I don’t take no for an answer. I’m constantly pushing and challenging organizations. And I highlight a number of these stories in my book. But I was constantly pushing and challenging not only Nintendo of America in ways that we needed to do better in ways that we needed to improve our approach whether that was in how we worked with our retailers but also in the activities we did internally how we trained and developed our staff. I was also aggressive with the Nintendo parent company in Kyoto in terms of pushing ideas that I thought made sense for the company. Now I was fortunate that Satoru Iwata and Shigeru Miyamoto and other executives supported my ideas and they appreciated how I was pushing the company. But that tenacity and that grit I think were critical at the time. And it’s core to who I am and my upbringing.

Just hiring people from diverse backgrounds at the entry level is not enough.

I think the second thing I would highlight in my own personal development and approach is I’m constantly pushing for different types of ideas. I call it lateral thinking I’ll take ideas from one industry and apply them to the next. I was fortunate that at Nintendo the approach of leveraging a variety of different ideas pushing the company to do things that hadn’t been done before was appreciated but it’s part of who I am it’s core to how I approach business.

So something that you mentioned earlier was the importance of diversity not just in hiring more staff from various backgrounds but at the leadership levels. Why is that so important? And why is just hiring your entry-level employees from a larger pool not sufficient?

Fundamentally I believe that if I work with people who have vastly different life experiences who have differences from how I think how I approach business that are all based on their own uniqueness — if we get a group of folks who have all of those unique and differentiated experiences — I’m convinced that we can solve any problem; that we can push forward successfully in any business. And so that fundamental belief and diversity is just core to who I am and its diversity in its biggest broadest scope.

In order to get there you really need to have a very open-minded approach because as you framed the question just hiring people from diverse backgrounds at the entry level is not enough. Because if you don’t have the right systems and support they’re not going to succeed to the highest levels. Or if they do it takes a really long time. So you have to have that mentality of diversity throughout the company. And for me it manifested in the people I hired at leadership levels it manifested in the ways I encouraged all of our staff to progress within the company. And I’m proud to say when I left Nintendo of America you know the team that I left behind was exceptionally diverse at the leadership level. And it’s because it’s something that I made a priority.

And so you know I think in order for any business or any industry to progress in this area it has to be a priority it has to be something that the leadership believes in and has to be something that is addressed at every level. And not just a mentality of “Well just get more diverse people at the entry level and we’ve done enough.” That’s never enough.

There needs to be continued evolution in digital types of events.

We’re here at PAX West. You’re famous for your participation in many events including your Nintendo debut. But we just went through a stretch where we had very few to no events and now we’re just getting back. People do seem to be responding and excited to be here. But in your mind in 2022 are live events like this still relevant?

They are absolutely relevant. And I say that because it’s incredibly important for players to get their hands on a controller; to experience a new piece of content. It’s important in their own process in deciding whether or not they’re going to buy that piece of content when it launches. It’s incredibly important for developers to see average consumers holding a controller and playing a game. Developers learn so much from seeing just how a consumer reacts to their piece of content.

And outside of just Quality Assurance.

Absolutely. Someone outside of QA because when you’re QA-ing a game you end up playing that game over and over again. I mean you’re trying to break the game. That’s different than being handed a controller and trying to play a game for fun and enjoyment. It’s a completely different experience. And developers obviously need both. I experienced this personally while at Nintendo to see a developer watching a player experience a game for the very first time the way they navigate their avatar it’s incredibly important and they learn so much. So these events yes are critically important.

But they’re also not enough. And I do believe that there needs to be continued evolution in digital types of events. You know I believe that platform holders need to find ways to make content available digitally at the same time that they’re holding a digital event. So imagine I’m going to be that President of Video Games again. Imagine during Pax and during Gamescom if platform holders made content available not just for players at the physical event to play but for players across the world to have a first hands-on experience. That’d be phenomenal. That would generate so much buzz and excitement for a particular piece of content. And some people have done this to a limited extent Nintendo is famous for doing a Nintendo Direct and at the end making content available immediately thereafter. But I think there’s an opportunity to do more and more of that so that you’re able to leverage the benefit of a physical environment.

I want to talk to you about your book. Disrupting the Game. A lot of people use a book as a bow to put on the end of a career. But this seems like more of a midpoint. So what compelled you to write the book? And what do you hope people take away from it?

The book is really part of my overall next mission which is empowering and encouraging the next generation of business leaders and doing it at scale. And when I say doing it at scale I certainly did it during my time at Nintendo but what I’m trying to do is to encourage to empower a vast majority of new leaders by sharing my lessons by sharing the benefit of my experience. So I’m doing this through the book I’m doing this through the speeches that I give I’m doing it through the board service that I do. It really is my opportunity to touch as many emerging leaders as I can and to give them the benefit of my knowledge and my experience. That’s what I’m trying to do now.

I’m incredibly passionate about it because I do believe that the best way for new leaders to hone their skills is for them to learn for them to have the benefit of lessons not just from me but from a variety of different potential teachers. So that’s the point of the book it is part of that overall approach. The feedback that I’ve had on the book has been phenomenal. The fact that it’s a best-selling book the fact that it has over 750 five-star reviews at this point in time is pretty phenomenal. But it really is just a piece of this overall passion to help develop the next generation of leaders.

At this point “the game” isn’t Nintendo or video games. The game is the industry itself.

It’s industry at its greatest power. You know I sit on three public boards they’re all very different businesses. They’re not in the video game business these public companies. And so you know for me it really is an ongoing opportunity to help shape the next generation of leadership at scale and across a range of different editions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWxzcHkuY29tL3R2L3VzdHYvYTQxMTQ3MTI3L2ZyaWVuZHMtY291cnRlbmV5LWNveC1yZXNwb25kcy10by1rYW55ZS13ZXN0LWNyaXRpY2lzbS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Courteney Cox responds to Kanye West's criticisms of Friends,"Friends star Courteney Cox has responded to Kanye West's criticisms of the show on social media with a funny video reply.

However it seems he agrees with the writer's opinion as he wrote on Instagram: ""but I wish I had"" [written the tweet].

The key to solving this issue Armstrong said is a reformed permitting process to expand infrastructure and meet clean energy demand.

“Really getting it done such that we can move ahead with very effectively building out the infrastructure in the U.S. – both for the sake of natural gas pipelines and renewables – we’ve got a lot of changes that need to be made and it’s a very complex issue” he said. “I don’t think that there will be support for anything that is not comprehensive and detailed enough to make it happen.”

As Congress returned from recess after Labor Day the industry is watching how a bipartisan permitting reform plan shapes up for energy infrastructure projects. Permitting reform was part of the Inflation Reduction Act approved this summer. Consumers have seen increased energy costs due in large part to lack of adequate natural gas infrastructure to serve growing demand.

“We have plenty of low-cost gas supplies here in the U.S. but if we don’t have the pipeline to get it from those places like the Marcellus and the Utica to the points of consumption people are going to be really upset this winter when they realize that their utility bills are up – not because we don’t have low-cost gas here in the U.S. and not because we are exporting it on an LNG basis – but because we keep standing in our own way to get critical infrastructure built.”

The U.S. has plenty of natural gas supplies Armstrong said to meet long-term demand both domestically and abroad while helping reduce emissions around the world by displacing the use of heavy-carbon fuels in other countries.

Under the deal Williams’ subsidiary Williams Field Services Group has acquired NorTex assets including approximately 80 miles of natural gas transmission pipelines and 36 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage in the Dallas-Fort Worth market.

NorTex also owns and operates a natural gas hub in North Texas named the Tolar Hub.

Williams expects the acquisition to improve its core natural gas pipeline and storage strategy.

In a press statement Williams said: “The NorTex assets provide critical service to approximately 4GW of gas fired power generation enabling Texas energy providers to successfully meet peak demands.”

Williams president and CEO Alan Armstrong said: “Serving one the fastest growing population centers in the United States this irreplaceable natural gas infrastructure is critical to bridging the gap between limited supplies and periods of peak demand while supporting the viability of intermittent renewables like solar and wind.

In early August the 23-time Grand Slam champion wrote in an essay for Vogue that she would be retiring from tennis.

For fans of Williams this year's US Open was likely a bittersweet moment. For aspiring founders Williams' retirement opens a window of opportunity. In her next chapter Williams said she planned to focus on her venture-capital firm Serena Ventures.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Williams launched Serena Ventures in 2014. Since then she and her partner Alison Rapaport Stillman have made angel investments in over 60 companies including the edtech unicorns like MasterClass and consumer-product startups like Billie and Daily Harvest.

In March Serena Ventures announced it had raised an inaugural fund of $111 million from outside investors including Alphabet Norwest LionTree and Kapor Center.

Stillman told Insider a core part of the mission of Serena Ventures was to back founders with ""incredible potential"" who might have been overlooked by other investors. More than half of the firm's portfolio companies were founded by women and more than three-fourths were founded by people from historically underrepresented backgrounds according to the firm's website.

Insider chatted with Stillman about how to land a spot in the Serena Ventures portfolio. Below Stillman explains how the firm evaluates prospective investments and what makes the winners stand out.

The nitty-gritty

The best way to submit a pitch to Serena Ventures is through the contact form on the firm's website. It receives about 200 pitches there a week and Stillman said they read each one.

Founders should send a deck with their pitch even if it's just a ""teaser deck."" Stillman said long emails and 10-page business plans on the other hand were not welcome.

""You want to do something that's going to make it easy for us to understand your business"" Stillman said.

About 10 to 20% of pitches receive a follow-up from the firm. Either Stillman Williams or another member of the firm's six-person team will schedule an introductory call with the founder.

The team also scores each prospective investment that makes it past the introductory rounds. Stillman said it scored companies in due diligence across a number of metrics. Those include ""business opportunity founder fit business model and mission alignment"" she told Insider by email. The scorecard helps the firm remain objective in its evaluation process.

""Maybe we're so enamored by the founder but when we actually take the time to dig down into the economics it might not be the right thing"" Stillman said. ""It's a helpful tool for us. It's not the only thing.""



Ultimately any founder who wins an investment from Serena Ventures will also have gone through a couple of rounds of interviews with Williams and Stillman. The entire process from pitch to investment can take anywhere from a few weeks to several months Stillman said.

It's all about the market

Serena Ventures invests in early-stage companies but Stillman said the firm understood that companies wouldn't always adhere to their original pitches as they grew.

""We know that what you're selling us at the pre-seed or seed probably isn't going to look like what the Series B investor sees at some level"" she said.

Still one key factor the firm looks for in an investment opportunity is whether the company is tapping into a sizable market that it's excited about.

Serena Ventures' portfolio companies span a variety of industries but Stillman said there were a few areas it had always been interested in. Financial services for what Stillman called the ""unbanked and underbanked"" and women's health companies have always ranked high on its list.

Every quarter the team brainstorms sectors it wants to dive deeper into. Right now the firm is excited about companies that address aging. That includes companies that focus on issues from mobility to menopause to deathtech Stillman said.

Coachable founders are key

Stillman. Serena Ventures

Another important factor is making sure that a founder is coachable. Stillman said it's especially important for founders to be self-aware enough to know when they need to hire employees.

""The founder can't be doing everything"" Stillman said. ""It's hard. It's your child. It's your baby. To be successful though you have to let go of the reins.""

Ultimately Stillman believes that a Serena Ventures company is defined by three qualities.

""A Serena Ventures company is gritty mission-oriented and pushing boundaries"" she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaXNwYXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC8yMDIyLzA5LzA5L29oaW8taW50ZWwtYmlkZW4tc3BlZWNoLW1pY3JvY2hpcC1mYWN0b3J5LWdyb3VuZGJyZWFraW5nLXByb2plY3QvNjYwMDkzODcwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Biden visits Ohio to break ground on $20 billion Intel project,"West Coast technology officially came together Friday with Midwest manufacturing prowess to create the Silicon Heartland.

Under a sun-splashed late summer day President Joe Biden joined Ohio political educational union and business leaders to break ground on Intel's $20 billion project in Licking County to create the world's most advanced semiconductor factories. It is the state's largest economic development prize.

Friday's groundbreaking also served as a celebration of the recently enacted CHIPS and Science Act that is meant to restore U.S. production of the tiny devices that power everything from cellphones to computers to cars to military equipment that has been largely shipped overseas. Biden signed the legislation into law last month and Intel has said the legislation will play a meaningful role in how it develops the site in Ohio.

Shortages of the chips have plagued the economy since the pandemic and have contributed to the rising cost of cars and other products.

President Biden gives speech on site of Intel microchip factory project groundbreaking

""Folks we need to make these chips right here in America to bring down everyday costs and create good jobs’’ Biden told about 700 people who gathered at the site.

Intel has been working for about two months at the site and not even Friday's ceremony stopped the earth moving work taking place behind the temporary stage where Biden political leaders educational leaders Intel executives and others spoke.

""The Rust Belt is dead and the Silicon Heartland begins"" Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said.

""This idea of Silicon Heartland (is) an epicenter of leading-edge technology and Intel's factories right here will produce the most advanced process technologies in the world"" he said. ""Our customers .... need the best stuff for their products everything from high-performance mobile artificial intelligence advance computing cloud all of that will be a result of these factories behind us.""

Gelsinger called the CHIPS Act the most significant piece of industrial legislation since World War II. Intel has said it is too soon to determine how much benefit it will get from the legislation.

The CHIPS Act provides $52.7 billion in incentives plus tax incentives for companies to research design and manufacture semiconductors and to help with workforce development.

As he did in his State of the Union speech in March Biden said the 1000-acre New Albany site is a ""field of dreams where America's future will be built.""

American production of semiconductors has stumbled from 37% in 1990 to about 12% today and that has put the country at risk as other countries offer billions of dollars to lure semiconductors Biden said.

The legislation has triggered a series of announcements by companies across the country to build semiconductor operations Biden said.

""The future of the chip industry is going to be made in America"" he said

The groundbreaking caps a frenzied eight months since Intel picked Licking County from a nationwide search as its spot for what could become the world's largest semiconductor operation with as many as eight plants - called ""fabs"" in the industry - and a total investment of $100 billion.

The plants will employ 3000 workers earning an average of $135000. There will be 7000 construction workers at the site as well. The plants also are expected to be a draw for Intel suppliers who will create thousands more jobs.

The Licking County plants are expected to start producing semiconductors in 2025.

""We can we must and we will make them here"" Gov. Mike DeWine said.

DeWine called the groundbreaking an historic moment for the state.

""We celebrate a great victory for Ohio but an even greater victory for our country"" he said.

What will Intel's plants in New Albany make?

Intel has said the campus in New Albany will be among its most advanced turning out semiconductors with a variety of applications for cars cellphones computers and other devices critical to a modern economy.

""It is a very important site. ... This will be a top-notch fab the most advanced fab in the country and the planet"" Intel Senior Vice President Randhir Thakur said in an interview with The Dispatch.

Beyond that the plants are expected to play a key role in Intel's new foundry business that was launched last year and is being led by Thakur.

Foundry work comes from companies that design their own semiconductors but use other companies to make them. Until now it's been a tiny part of Intel's business but Gelsinger has pledged to make it a much bigger part of Intel's business and that includes the new plants in Ohio.

As part of this foundry work Thakur said the New Albany plants will manufacture chips for the military and military contractors. Intel has said it expects the market for foundry work to grow from $90 billion a year to $200 billion a year by 2030.

Exactly how much of that business will be done in Ohio will be determined over time Thakur said.

Groundbreaking receives bipartisan support

Politicians from both sides of the aisles have rallied around the Intel project. A host of state legislative leaders praised the project as did Sens. Rob Portman a Republican and Sherrod Brown a Democrat during Friday's ceremonies that ran for more than two hours.

""Today as we acknowledge all the hard work that went into bringing Intel to Ohio we also acknowledge the hard work before us that now begins as we begin to close America's competitiveness gap that has grown dangerously wide in regard to semiconductor manufacturing"" Portman said. ""I'm really proud Ohioans will play an important role in closing this gap.""

Brown said in January when he flew to Ohio for the Intel announcement that the news marked a major change for the Ohio economy.

""I remember looking out the window of the plane at all the places that have been long been ignored by Wall Street and passed over by corporate America and forgotten by our government and I thought about how from that day forward we're going to change that"" Brown recalled telling Portman and others on the flight ""Today we're burying the term Rust Belt.""

Industry leaders welcome Intel project

""It's hard to state how important this is"" said Jay Timmons president and CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers and a native of Circleville who attended Friday's groundbreaking.

""We see what happens when we depend on critical products coming from overseas especially during the pandemic"" Timmons said noting how hard the shortage of semiconductors has made it to buy cars for example.

The CHIPS Act demonstrates how indispensable technology is in today's economy and the law is critical to help ensure that shortages don't happen again said Jason Oxman CEO of the Information Technology Industry Council a global advocate for technology.

Why it matters: These moves signal that we’ve shifted into a new chapter of the pandemic — and that employers are desperate to get people back to the office.

Employers are trying to reduce any barriers to entry for new hires says Erin Grau co-founder of Charter a media and services company focused on the future of work who's hearing from executives who are dropping their mandates.

The requirements are also expensive and time-consuming for employers — another reason to stop she adds.

What's happening: “[Companies] decided that the rationale for [mandates] had become weak enough that they don’t want to continue” Jeff Levin-Scherz population health leader at Willis Towers Watson tells Axios.

Yes but: There's a risk that dropping these requirements would make some workers less willing to mingle with their colleagues — for fear of becoming sick.

Companies mostly don't want to talk about this seeing little upside given the controversial history of mandates. But a few large employers' plans are public:

Starting this week Goldman Sachs lifted vaccination requirements everywhere but New York City where it still has a mandate for workplaces.

""With many tools including vaccination improved treatments and testing now available there is significantly less risk of severe illness"" Goldman told employees in a memo announcing the change obtained by Axios.

In June Cisco stopped requiring vaccination for ""office entry travel event attendance or visiting customers partners and other third parties” per its website.

JPMorgan Chase said it would start hiring unvaccinated individuals again back in March.

Zoom out: The White House yesterday called on businesses to take certain actions to protect employees and customers from COVID-19 this fall. Mandates weren't on the list.

Instead the administration says employers should be ""helping their employees access updated COVID-19 vaccines."" The White House also recommends employers share information on treatment options and improve indoor air quality as well as provide paid time off for anyone getting a shot.

There are other things employers can do as well like telling people not to come in if they're sick and ""if possible offer remote work for those with symptoms"" says Dr. Leana Wen a public health professor at George Washington University.

Between the lines: Things have changed a lot since these mandates were first put in place last year — a time when vaccination was seen as very effective against spreading disease. Now with the variants that's less true Wen says.

""At this point in the pandemic the case for vaccine mandates is much weaker than it was in 2021"" she adds.

But not all companies are giving up on mandates. Many hospitals and other healthcare providers do require vaccination.

Google Edelman and Facebook told Axios Seattle reporter Melissa Santos that employees who enter the office must be vaccinated.

Seven other employers she contacted were less forthcoming.

Microsoft which has set a standard that employees spend 50% of their time in the office declined to comment.

Salesforce which runs Seattle-based Tableau would only say they follow all state and local health requirements. (Most private employers aren’t required to impose vaccine mandates.)

The bottom line: We're in a new era — for now. Everyone's watching to see what happens with cases in the fall.

Tens of thousands of public sector employees lost their jobs because of the mandate. And the number of private sector workers fired for not getting jabbed is easily in the hundreds of thousands.

But with the “Great Resignation” employers are finding it extremely difficult to fill positions with vaccinated employees. So very quietly companies are dropping the vaccine mandates to fill positions.

As we’ve seen the vaccines have done little to stop the spread of the virus although there is ample evidence those who contract COVID don’t get as sick as the unvaccinated. And there may have been a rationale at one time for employees at risk of serious illness — obesity diabetes asthma or chronic lung disease sickle cell disease or who are immunocompromised — to get vaccinated. But for healthy adults the vaccines offer little in the way of immunity from COVID.

So says the science. And the White House appears to have dropped the recommendation for mandates in the workplace in their new guidance.

The White House yesterday called on businesses to take certain actions to protect employees and customers from COVID-19 this fall. Mandates weren’t on the list. Instead the administration says employers should be “helping their employees access updated COVID-19 vaccines.” The White House also recommends employers share information on treatment options and improve indoor air quality as well as provide paid time off for anyone getting a shot.

What of the employees who refused to get vaccinated and lost their jobs because of it? Most employees quit in advance of the imposition of the penalty for not getting jabbed. But for anyone who didn’t get vaccinated the chances are very good that if they’re still looking for a job they shouldn’t have any trouble getting hired — vaccinated or not.",,,,,,

At SW Steakhouse in Wynn Las Vegas you can certainly do the full-bore experience occupying a table in the hubbuby (in the best sense) dining room bestride the Lake of Dreams attending to chilled seafood and pampered cuts of beef and truffled this and that.

You also could do what I call picnicking at the bar (especially when you’re just one or two). Picnicking requires less commitment than the main restaurant — it’s perfectly fine to order just an appetizer with a glass of wine. Service is quicker too and you never know whom you might meet on the next stool.

A recent picnic dinner at the bar featured carpaccio ($30) a Spanish sparkling ($18) and the restaurant’s wondrous pull-apart monkey bread (free).

The carpaccio fashioned from famed Snake River Farms beef generously blanketed a large plate the beef strewn with arugula sun-dried tomatoes and shaved Parmesan. The dish: salty nutty peppery sweet. A stem of Raventós i Blanc de Nit Rosé sparkling wine from Spain made concord with carpaccio.

It’s a “gorgeous sparkler that allows the beef to sing while the bubbles enhance the pepper in the arugula and the natural sweetness of the sun-dried tomatoes” said Brian Weitzman executive director of wine at Wynn. (Raventós dates to the late 15th century and makes some of Spain’s finest wines. If you haven’t tried them do.)

And now to the bread. Ah me this bread. “Its mother was a brioche and its father a pretzel bread” as Wynn explains justly praising the pull-apart’s soft texture buttery glaze and “final zap of pretzel salt.” The bread is served warm and no one would blame you if you wanted to picnic all evening on the bread alone.

With summer travel season in full swing and COVID-19 restrictions continuing to wane in the U.S. (via Politico) it's easier than ever to hit the road — or the airport — and find your next food-filled adventure. Whether traveling by car on a snack-fueled road trip or jet-setting to your next destination hotels are there to provide familiar comforts decadent amenities and dining options that go well-beyond breakfast in bed or outstanding room service.

Hotel restaurants are a far cry from the stereotypical mediocrity of yesteryear and with travel back to its pre-pandemic frenzy they're ready for a rebound (via FSR Magazine). Nowadays hotels have become havens of fine dining and chef-driven creativity. With Michelin stars aplenty hotel restaurants have become destinations in and of themselves whether or not guests are staying on property passing through town or living locally and from the quaint coast of Maine to the bumping nightlife of Miami Beach they can be found in every corner of the country.

Xcel Energy is planning to sell more land in the city of Becker Minnesota for a data center project. The new project is separate from a long-planned facility Google is developing on nearby land also owned by Xcel.

Xcel last week filed a petition with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to approve selling 348 acres to Elk River Technologies LLC. Minnesota corporate records show that company was incorporated in May but offer little more information. Becker City Administrator Greg Lerud told the publication he didn’t know who's behind the project.

The latest data center would have 100 full-time employees and would create more than 1200 building trades jobs Xcel told the Star Tribune. Xcel offered no other details about the data center except to say it's not a cryptocurrency mining project.

""It's a pretty big deal for Xcel and it is a big economic development project [for the area]"" said Sherburne County Administrator Bruce Messelt.

Elk River Technologies has an option to buy the land through Jan. 21 2023 but the option can be extended three times through July 21 2024. The sale price is $7.7 million and Xcel's profit would be $7.5 million given the land's low book value the PUC filing said.

The Minneapolis-based utility plans to close three big coal-fired generators at Sherco by 2030. First built in 1976 the coal-powered plant has a capacity of up to 2238MW and is the largest power plant in the state. The site was initially constructed by Northern States Power Company (NSP) now a subsidiary of Xcel Energy.

Xcel confirmed that the new data center would be separate from the Google project.

Google was first reported as looking at building a $600 million data center on land next to the power plant in 2019; the search giant plans to build a 375000 square foot data center on roughly 300 acres of land owned by Xcel.

In February 2022 however Xcel said during a Minnesota Public Utilities Commission that Google is still yet to buy the land from Xcel and the company’s option to buy the land expires at the end of this year. Both companies said the project was still on track however.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9yZXZpZXctZmxvcmVuY2UtdGhlLW1hY2hpbmUtZGFuY2UtZGF5cy1hcnJpdmVkLWluLXN0LXBhdWwtd2VsY2gteGNlbC1lbmVyZ3ktY2VudGVyLzYwMDIwNTE4My_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Review: Florence + the Machine's pandemic days are over as she danced in St. Paul,"Everybody dance now. That was the overriding message from Florence + the Machine (FATM) Thursday night at Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul.

If we could only dance like Florence Welch.

Celebrating her band's fifth album this spring's ""Dance Fever"" the tall barefoot Brit in the diaphanous layered white dress leaped and spun with physicality and grace like a celestial creature sent to free us from personal and societal traumas.

A ginger-haired ballerina with a siren's opulent stratospheric voice Welch mesmerized for 110 minutes. Since her 2011 local debut at the Minnesota Zoo the indie-rock star has exhibited a commanding presence part goth drama queen part earth angel all beguiling unrelenting force.

It was a riveting performance by Welch of not always compelling music in front of 7000 fans in the bowl end of the arena.

FATM offered 12 of the 14 tracks from ""Dance Fever"" which is not about clubbing but about the transformative powers of dance.

Welch has explained that the project was inspired by choreomania a medieval European practice wherein throngs of people in order to relieve themselves of stress danced until they were exhausted injured or dead.

She even wrote a song called ""Choreomania"" which she offered Thursday. ""Suddenly I'm dancing to imaginary music"" she sang. And she danced — did she ever dance — and darted into the crowd as the Machine sped up the beat.

The ensuing ""Kiss With a Fist"" a full-tilt rocker from FATM's 2008 debut album found Welch doing a jittery jig before pogoing in overdrive. This concert featured the most pogoing — onstage and in the crowd — this side of a punk-rock gig.

Between her Titanic vocal explosions Welch 36 occasionally spoke in a strikingly soft voice. She pointed out that much of ""Dance Fever"" was written during the pandemic when her anxiety over never performing again was at its peak. That anxiety was apparent in her conversation lyrics and nervous energy.

The album the singer said is about the ""resurrection of dance"" as she eased into ""My Love"" with its banging disco-y beat.

Welch resurrected songs from earlier albums including the bouncy ""Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)"" the rocking ""What Kind of Man"" and the galvanizing 2009 hit ""Dog Days Are Over"" during which she paused and asked the fans to put away their cellphones for a moment and cut loose. They obliged on both counts.

Working on a modest platform decorated with candelabras draped with gauzy white fabric Welch bounded all over the stage skipping scurrying and spinning. A couple of times she jumped into the pit in front of the stage and once sprinted through the main floor crowd while singing.

Adding to the drama was the singer's propensity for back lighting silhouettes on scrims and theatrical gestures with her hands and face which were as expressive as her singing voice. Meanwhile her six anonymous musicians stood off to the sides in the shadows never introduced.

Including so much material from the new album slowed momentum at times though some of the new numbers including ""Prayer Factory"" ""Free"" and ""Choreomania"" were among the night's highlights.

For Welch this fourth gig on FATM's current North American tour was highly emotional and clearly liberating. Her pandemic days are over.

""I'm free when I'm dancing"" she proclaimed in the song ""Free."" Aren't we all?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vaWxzci5vcmcvYXJlLXV0aWxpdGllcy1ibG9ja2luZy1yb29mdG9wLXNvbGFyLWZyb20tdGhlLXBvd2VyLWdyaWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Are Utilities Blocking Rooftop Solar From the Power Grid?,"When you picture rooftop solar you probably imagine workers strapped into harnesses carrying solar panels and clambering around on top of a building. But homeowners businesses and community groups aren’t done once the panels are up on their roofs. To sell excess solar energy solar owners also need to plug their new systems into the grid — if the electric utility will let them.

While some utilities may process applications for rooftop solar projects that want to connect to the grid in a matter of days others may take weeks or months. There are a number of plausible explanations for why some utilities are such laggards including state policy requirements physical grid limitations or even intentional obstruction from utilities trying to block competition from rooftop solar. As utilities often aren’t required to publicly report these timelines customers have little way of knowing whether utility delays in connecting their solar panels to the grid are reasonable or not.

The federal government through the Energy Information Administration should collect better information from electric utilities to help identify what’s holding solar back. In ILSR’s survey last year of distributed solar installers and developers about two thirds of respondents identified interconnection rules (rules on how utilities connect local solar to the grid) as one of the barriers causing the greatest unanticipated costs and/or delays. Since solar owners have no choice but to work with their local monopoly utility these delays slow solar growth and increase costs blocking the power of communities to build a clean and equitable energy future. With nearly half of all American homeowners interested in going solar — potentially a huge boost in the fight against climate change — we need to make sure the grid interconnection process isn’t standing in their way.

Plugging Into the Grid

The process of hooking up a solar installation to the local utility’s power grid is known as interconnection. Both rooftop projects and big solar farms go through the interconnection process but the steps involved can vary depending on project size and type the utility’s own requirements and state policies. Often a project might need to apply to the utility for interconnection approval before installing the solar panels and again after installation for permission to start operating. The flowchart below from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory shows some of the common steps in solar project development. (In the chart AHJ is Authority Having Jurisdiction and PTO is Permission to Operate.)

Delays to the interconnection process inconvenience solar owners and curb the expansion of local solar energy. “It’s very frustrating for our customers because they’ve paid for a system we’ve installed it it’s ready to go. And it’s not producing any energy for them because the utility company is so slow” shared one solar installer we interviewed last year. Unpredictable interconnection timelines also make it difficult to plan and complete what should be routine solar installation projects.

Find more insights into the barriers to distributed solar deployment in ILSR’s 2021 Local Solar Developer Survey.

State Rules Don’t Explain Variation in Utility Interconnection Times

Some states have implemented policies meant to streamline the interconnection process like eliminating applications for certain project sizes and mandating timelines for both utilities and installers. These policies can apply to only one type of electric providers like investor-owned utilities and not others like electric cooperatives or municipal utilities. Still utility interconnection timelines often vary within a state even when the utilities in question are subject to the same state policies.

This is evident in the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s SolarTRACE database which aggregates data on how long it takes rooftop solar installations to complete different steps of the project development process including interconnection.

As an example the graph below shows the wide variation in Arizona utilities’ median pre-installation interconnection timelines for rooftop solar projects up to 10 kilowatts as reported in the SolarTRACE database. (In the graph the wider bar shows the utility’s median timeline and the narrower bar shows the statewide median for solar projects across Arizona both in business days.) Despite some data limitations that make it hard to draw firm conclusions such as small sample sizes for certain utilities it’s apparent that interconnection differences exist across utilities in the state.

﻿

View the full version of the above graph with all available state and utility pre-installation interconnection data or view a similar comparison of post-installation interconnection timelines.

Analysis of the SolarTRACE data by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory similarly failed to find a clear connection between stricter state mandates and faster pre-installation interconnection timelines. For illustration the graph below from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory study compares state timeline requirements to pre-installation interconnection approval timelines for projects up to 10 kilowatts installed in 2017-2019.

One way utilities may be able to sidestep state interconnection requirements is by putting project applications “on hold” effectively pausing state-mandated timelines. In other cases electric utilities may just fail to meet the timelines altogether especially if regulators don’t hold utilities accountable to state interconnection requirements.

A Need for More Interconnection Data

Since they make money by selling energy and building infrastructure (or under-value customer-owned assets) electric utilities have an incentive to discourage customer-owned solar and they often drag their feet when connecting local projects to the grid. At the extreme end states have penalized some utilities for their interconnection failures including a $1 million fine Minnesota issued to Xcel Energy for excessive customer complaints about the solar interconnection process.

The Solar TRACE database suggests there’s potentially a wider problem with lengthy interconnection timelines. However we can’t be sure without more robust and transparent public data. The installations included in the SolarTRACE dataset account for less than a third of all relevant solar installations from the covered years (2017-2021) and SolarTRACE has no data at all for 16 states.

Electric utilities have a monopoly over the platform that solar installers need to reach their customers — the electric grid — and for the competitive solar marketplace to thrive all market participants (researchers advocates solar companies and regulators) need access to the data. Collecting the data in a national standardized way as could be done through the federal Energy Information Administration and making the data publicly available would allow for greater oversight of utilities and make it easier to identify utility abuses of power.

Streamlining interconnection processes is essential to quickly and equitably deploy the affordable solar energy that communities across the country are clamoring for. In order to fight the climate crisis and address high energy burdens we need to make it easy for all Americans to install solar panels and connect their systems to the local electric grid. To do that we have to figure out how long it takes in the first place.

DENVER (AP) — Chief Justice John Roberts defended the authority of the Supreme Court to interpret the Constitution saying its role should not be called into question just because people disagree with its decisions.

When asked to reflect on the last year at the court in his first public appearance since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade Roberts said Friday he was concerned that lately some critics of the court’s controversial decisions have questioned the legitimacy of the court which he said was a mistake. He did not mention any specific cases or critics by name.

“If the court doesn’t retain its legitimate function of interpreting the constitution I’m not sure who would take up that mantle. You don’t want the political branches telling you what the law is and you don’t want public opinion to be the guide about what the appropriate decision is” Roberts said while being interviewed by two judges from the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals at its conference in Colorado Springs.

Roberts described the last year as an unusual and difficult one pointing to the public not be allowed inside the court closed in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic as one hardship. He also said it was “gut wrenching” to drive into the Supreme Court that was surrounded by barricades every day.

The barriers were installed in May when protests erupted outside the court and outside the homes of some Supreme Court justices after there was an unprecedented leak of a draft opinion indicating the justices were planning to overturn Roe v. Wade which provided women constitutional protections for abortion for nearly 50 years. The barriers are gone and the public will be allowed back inside when the court's new session begins in October but an investigation ordered by Roberts into the leak continues.

Speaking at the same conference Thursday Justice Neil Gorsuch said it is “terribly important” to identify the leaker and said he is expecting a report on the progress of the investigation “I hope soon.”

Gorsuch condemned the leak as have other justices who have addressed it publicly.

“Improper efforts to influence judicial decision-making from whatever side from whomever are a threat to the judicial decision-making process"" Gorsuch said. Reporters from The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg attended the talk.

The leaked draft was largely incorporated into Justice Samuel Alito's final opinion in June that overturned Roe v. Wade in a case upholding Mississippi's law banning abortion after 15 weeks. The ruling paved the way for severe abortion restrictions or bans in nearly half of U.S. states.

In June's ruling Roberts appointed to the court in 2005 by former President George W. Bush voted to uphold Mississippi's law but he did not join the conservative justices in also overturning Roe v. Wade as well as Planned Parenthood v. Casey the 1992 decision that reaffirmed the right to end a pregnancy. He wrote that there was no need to overturn the broad precedents to uphold the state law saying he would take “a more measured course.”

Roberts has spoken out repeatedly about the importance of the judiciary’s independence and to rebut perceptions of the court as a political institution not much different than Congress or the presidency.

Opinion polls since the leak and the release of the final abortion decision though have shown a sharp drop in approval of the court and confidence in the institution.

When asked what the public might not know about how the court work Roberts emphasized the collegiality among the justices and the court's tradition of shaking hands before starting conferences or taking the bench. After the justices might disagree about a decision everyone eats together in the court's dining room where they talk about everything but work he said. He said it's not borne out of “fake affection” but a respect that comes from the push and pull of explaining ideas and listening to the responses to them.

“We have a common calling and we act like it” he said.

And this is certainly true for the project featured in this interview.

The editors of Supply and Demand Chain Executive sit down with executives from Raymond to hear how to optimize a warehouse for maximum efficiency and how it was able to help food insecurity reduction with Crossroads Community Services. The project was selected as one of SDCE's Top Supply Chain Projects of 2022.

Supply and Demand Chain Executive: Please describe the project.

Raymond: In 2019 Crossroads Community Services turned to Malin a Raymond Solutions and Support Center to learn best practices of receiving/shipping; to maximize efficient use of the additional warehouse space and inventory control. Crossroads Community Services had recently moved its operation which aims to alleviate pockets of food insecurity in the southern sector of Dallas County as well as in Ellis and Navarro counties in Texas from about 10000 square feet to 72000 square feet and needed help from Malin to ensure it was safely and fully utilizing all the benefits of such a fantastic new distribution facility.

Supply and Demand Chain Executive: What was the inspiration for this project?

Raymond: Fourteen months after Crossroads Community Services opened its new warehouse facility the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic hit the Dallas area in March 2020. Just as Crossroads Community Services was starting to get comfortable in the new space it faced a new challenge: unprecedented demand. In April 2020 the food pantry saw the number of daily visits double overnight. The food pantry which was projected to distribute 900000 pounds of food was challenged with demand exceeding its expectations.

Supply and Demand Chain Executive: How did it make a difference for the company?

Raymond: Crossroads Community Services turned Malin to learn best practices of receiving/shipping; to maximize efficient use of the additional warehouse space and inventory control; and to safely and fully utilize all the benefits of such a fantastic new distribution facility. Raymond Lean Management (RLM) allowed Crossroads Community Services to identify and implement small enhancements and tweaks in its processes which significantly impacted its production and efficiency. RLM added value to Crossroads Community Services by empowering employees to make improvements and take ownership of the tasks they accomplished daily. By teaching workers to spot inefficiencies or potential errors in their work lean management provided them with practical tools to share their ideas and develop impactful long-term solutions.

Supply and Demand Chain Executive: How does this project provide innovation during the supply chain crisis and disruptions seen this past year?

Raymond: When demand increased due to COVID-19 Crossroads Community Services used RLM teachings to continue identifying waste inside its warehouse. Through this process the organization realized it was underutilizing its space. Malin helped Crossroads Community Services audit its current warehouse setup and identified areas for improvement. Then Malin was able to develop a new warehouse layout based on the turning radius of the warehouse fleet that included more areas for smart storage and increased racking inside its warehouse and cold-storage operations.

These continuous improvements extended beyond the warehouse floor for Crossroads Community Services. It helped identify waste and implement technology upgrades in other departments including shipping/receiving and in the pantry shopping experience.

Using RLM strategies and techniques to process store and distribute nutritious food the pantry distributed over 2750000 pounds and the Crossroads Community Services network collectively distributed 11800000 pounds of food in 2020.

Supply and Demand Chain Executive: What makes this project different than others in the industry?

Raymond: The goal of Raymond Lean Management is different in that it doesn’t just help operators solve problems but also teaches them how to solve them on their own going forward. RLM is designed to instill a culture of continuous improvement throughout the organization to boost productivity and efficiency through visualization standardized work target-based key performance indicators (KPIs) and continuous improvement activities to provide the best possible solutions.

Supply and Demand Chain Executive: How did/does this project fit into the overall operations of the company?

Raymond: The RLM training course helped Crossroads Community Services identify areas of improvement to maximize its new warehouse space and enhance customers’ overall shopping experience.

The food pantry also optimized the client experience by using RLM principles to implement a one-way shopping lane significantly improving the shopping experience. Clients in the pantry intake area work with volunteers to build customized shopping lists based on their families’ nutritional and caloric needs. When out on the pantry floor the lists help organize the shopping experience and tell the shoppers exactly where their items are in the pantry by aisle and shelf so there is no need to backtrack or search for items.

Supply and Demand Chain Executive: What do you think the future holds for this project?

Raymond: Raymond and Malin are honored to have helped Crossroads Community Services improve its operation and ensure it could continue its mission to alleviate pockets of food insecurity in the southern sector of Dallas County as well as in Ellis and Navarro counties in Texas. Although Raymond and Malin’s involvement with the organization ended after they helped it optimize its new facility Crossroads Community Services continues to improve its operations through a culture of continuous improvement using the RLM techniques and other optimizations Malin helped implement. Raymond and Malin are excited to see the success Crossroads Community Services has had in its new facility and hope their involvement helps the organization better serve the community.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHluZXdzaHVuZ2FyeS5jb20vZW1lcmdpbmctdGVjaG5vbG9naWVzLXNoYXBpbmctdGhlLW5mbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Emerging technologies shaping the NFL,"With recent technological advancements more people have access to real-time games and sports leagues making the NFL experience even more enjoyable. This has led to the rise in social media groups where sports fans interact with other NFL league fans.

The league has also capitalised on technology by broadcasting its games on non-traditional media and making the viewing experience more convenient. Mobile apps in particular improve the overall experience and keep sports followers informed about what’s happening in the league. In addition thanks to technology such as the Zebra RFID betters sportsbooks and coaches can better analyse players’ performance on the field thus making informed decisions about their favourites.

This article seeks to explore the emerging technologies shaping the NFL.

Sideline Viewing Systems and Surface Tablets

Coaches relied on faxed images of defensive and offensive formations on the sidelines of the series. However in 2015 the NFL started to track player movement with the Microsoft Surface Pro 3 a tablet with a stylus that allows coaches to gather valuable data about the players. This data offers the technical bench valuable information helpful in making tactical decisions on the game.

The tablets have a unique configuration that prevents anyone from altering information the addition of more images on the screen and the option of adding multiple colours to represent different characters while scribbling. This game-changing technology has boosted both players’ and coaches’ confidence and morale for the game.

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Chips

The NFL has been using Zebra RFID (radio frequency identification) since the 2011-2012 season. The system uses a chip in players’ shoulder pads that captures real-time information including the player’s distance position and speed. This unique feature enables game officials to monitor the game’s progress.

The data captured is useful in producing statistics on how a player is doing on the field compared to other players. Also coaches can use it to determine what switches they need to make in the team for an upcoming match and the types of exercises that can boost a player’s physical performance.

NFL Helmet Technology

NFL has been dedicated to revolutionising how technology can be leveraged to eliminate injuries during the game. With that it has awarded grants to software companies to design helmet technology that is safe for the player and useful for game officials.

This technology is used to make tailor-made helmets for players depending on their positions and biodata. They are fitted with state-of-the-art software that analyzes player impact during a game and reduces head impact exposure (HIE). Some NFL helmet technology in the market can analyze HIE and compare it with their database of player reports. This information is salvaged and used to make better helmets for NFL players.

Live Streaming

The NFL uses live broadcasts for every game which makes it possible for fans clubs players and other stakeholders to stream the games from the federations. In addition thanks to various streaming options users have multiple ways to catch up with the NFL games.

You can stream the current NFL season games from your set-box phone or laptop. And if you’re a local game fan you can access them on your downloaded streaming app. With a good internet connection you can get the latest NFL spreads best bets lines odds picks and predictions for your favorite team.

In the US you can stream games from various channels such as Amazon Prime Video ESPN FOX CBS NBC and the NFL network. For tablets and smartphones you can stream the season’s games on NFL plus which allows you to watch the game at a fee. Fubo TV and Sling TV are excellent choices if you’re looking to cut costs.

The NFL Game pass allows you to stream the games after the end of the game. Additionally you can watch various preseason games view condensed games within a short time or listen to radio broadcasts.

You can watch the NFL games live with services like Tablo or Channel Master if you have a good TV antenna. Also with a set box you can watch recorded games after the game ends.

Conclusion

It has taken us to a day where the physically impaired walk and the deaf hears and responds. It is not a miracle but technology is making extraordinary changes. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) about 15% of the world's population (over one billion people) have some kind of disability. It is not a good idea to have people guide and help them throughout their life. Fortunately technology has come to their rescue. Artificial intelligence (AI) is the development of computer systems that are able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. With the help of AI and its applications people with disabilities can live normal life like everybody. Unlike others people with disabilities see artificial intelligence as a light at the end of the tunnel. In the developing era of technology the gap between people with disabilities and the world keeps narrowing.,,,,,,

A Zoetis run survey of more than 200 farmers by Zoetis found nearly 60% wished to receive further education on mastitis prevention during lactation and the dry period. Our survey shows there has already been a massive step-change in how many farmers manage this condition.

For example 90% of respondents are practising selective dry cow therapy (SDCT). However it also highlighted that while farmers may think they know the greatest cause of mastitis on their farm some aren't doing any monitoring at all.

The majority of farmers surveyed considered lactation origin environmental infection the primary source of transmission. However a study in the Veterinary Record in 20161 found that for almost half of farms the environment within the dry period is a more significant source of infection than in lactation.

This could indicate that many farmers are underestimating the true importance of dry period origin infections that then cause cases of mastitis in early lactation. This reinforces the need for further education highlighting the importance of the correct use of teat sealants to reduce the chance of acquiring new infections during the dry period.
