Money raised will be donated to Ukrainian refugees…

… and a charity supporting the wellbeing of young girls

Back in 2021 Porsche and Pixar Animation Studios forged a new partnership that would see the pair produce a real-life 911 inspired by Sally Carrera from the movie Cars (which is arguably one of the most important car films of all time). This is the finished product next to a life-sized replica of the animated star car.

The Porsche 911 Sally Special which is based on the latest 992 model has now been sold at auction during the 2022 Monterey Car Week where it fetched an astonishing $3.6 million – equivalent to around £3m – with all proceeds going to charity.

The funds raised by the sale of the car will be divided between the UN Refugee Agency to help the people of Ukraine and Girls Inc. – a charity focused on empowering young women across the USA and Canada providing education and mentoring to improve their standard of living.

Go on then tell me more about this real-life Sally Special

The Sally Carrera in the film is a 996-generation Porsche 911 but the real-life Sally Special is based on the current 911 Carrera GTS. That means it’s powered by a 3.0-litre flat-six petrol engine which produces 473bhp and 420lb/ft of torque – enough for a 0–62mph time of around three seconds. It’s also fitted with a manual gearbox which the designers say reflects “Sally Carrera’s passion for driving.”

To make the Sally Special match Sally Carrera Porsche painted the car in an exclusive shade of metallic blue called – wait for it – Sallybluemetallic. Say it how you see it Porsche. Because it’s a unique colour the paint needed to be applied by hand and during the process the company painted most of the 911’s exterior trims to try to smooth over the car’s vents and make it look more like the 996-generation car.

Porsche also designed a unique set of alloy wheels styled to mimic the 996-generation car’s five-spoke Turbo Twist wheels. The Sally Special even features a “tattoo” decal on the underside of its rear wing just like the one Sally has in the film. To finish off the car’s exterior Porsche fixed a remanufactured version of the 996’s Carrera badge to its engine cover.

Porsche’s modifications are equally extensive on the inside. The seats are trimmed in a blend of houndstooth fabric and cream leather while the interior trims are finished in the same metallic blue paint as the bodywork. There are even some special badges – the Pixar Cars logo is set into the door cards and there’s a drawing of Sally on a plaque for the passenger side dash.

Pixar’s Director of Franchise Jay Ward explained the thinking behind the project. ‘We wanted to help somehow and as a team we realised we could perhaps harness what we were working on to raise money. The whole project began with the premise that Sally’s character was devoted to helping others – and it seems right that this should continue 20 years on.’

Kjell Gruner President and CEO of Porsche North America echoed his comments saying: ‘My own daughters grew up watching Sally and it’s wonderful that we can mark a special anniversary with something meaningful that will help others.’",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdXN0cmFsaWFuZ2VvZ3JhcGhpYy5jb20uYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA4LzNtLXRhbGwtYW5kLXdlaWdoaW5nLTYwMGtnLXRodW5kZXItYmlyZHMtYmlnLWJvbmVzLXJldmVhbC1yZWFsLXJlYXNvbi1mb3ItZXh0aW5jdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3m tall and weighing 600kg: thunder bird's big bones reveal real reason for extinction,"3m tall and weighing 600kg: Thunder bird’s BIG bones reveal reason for extinction

By AG STAFF •

Reading Time: 4 Minutes • Print this page

Big bones from the extinct ‘thunder bird’ or dromornithid excavated in the northern reaches of the Flinders Ranges and a near Alice Springs have yielded new insights into their breeding patterns.

Studies of these giant Australian fossil bones by University of Cape Town (UCT) and Flinders University vertebrate palaeontologists indicate their size and breeding cycle gradually changed over millennia but ultimately couldn’t keep pace with the environmental changes around them.

“Sadly for these amazing animals which already faced rising challenges of climate change as the interior of Australia became hotter and dryer their breeding biology and size couldn’t match the more rapid breeding cycle of modern day (smaller) emus to keep pace with these more demanding environmental conditions” says Professor Anusuya Chinsamy-Turan from UCT South Africa.

“Questions such as how long these gigantic birds took to reach adult size and sexual maturity are key to understand their evolutionary success and their ultimate failure to survive alongside humans.

“We studied thin sections of the fossilised bones of these thunder birds under the microscope so that we could identify the biological signals recorded within. The microscopic structure of their bones gives us information about how long they took to reach adult size when they reached sexual maturity and we can even tell when the females were ovulating.”



Flinders University Associate Professor Trevor Worthy (above left) holds a leg ‘drumstick’ bone of an ancient Dromornis ‘Thunder Bird’ and modern-day emu tibiotarsus bone. Flinders University researcher Warren Handley (above right) excavating Dromornis bones in 2015 recently used to test the breeding biology of the ancient birds.







The research published in The Anatomical Record compares the bones of the oldest and largest mihirung (the Aboriginal name for the bird) Dromornis stirtoni which lived 7 million years ago stood up to 3m tall and had a mass of up to 600kg – through to the smallest of the flightless birds Genyornis newtoni – the last species of mihirung – which lived alongside early emus now the world’s third-largest bird behind the ostrich and.

The study indicates Dromornis stirtoni – arguably the largest bird ever to live on Earth – took a long time to grow to full body size and to become sexually mature possibly up to 15 years.

By the late Pleistocene era of Genyornis newtoni the climate was much drier with more seasonal variation and unpredictable droughts. These birds grew six times larger than emus with a body mass around 240kg but grew to adult size faster than the first mihirung likely within 1-2 years and started breeding soon thereafter.

However they needed several more years to reach adult body size and so their growth strategy was still quite slow compared to nearly all modern birds that reach adult size in a year and can breed in the second year of their life.

Co-author Flinders University Associate Professor Trevor Worthy from Flinders Palaeontology adds that dromornithids were contemporary with emus for a very long time before the final mihirung went extinct.

Mihirung and emu bones show relative size difference.

“In fact they persisted together through several major environmental and climatic perturbations” he says. “However while Genyornis was better adapted than its ancestors and survived through two million years of the Pleistocene when arid and drought conditions were the norm it was still a slow-growing and slow-breeding bird compared to the emu.

“The differing breeding strategies displayed by emus and dromornithids gave the emu a key advantage when the paths of these birds crossed with humans about 50 thousand years ago with the last of the dromornithids goings extinct about 40 thousand years ago.

“In the end the mihirungs lost the evolutionary race and an entire order of birds was lost from Australia and the world.”

Although the bones of the late Pleistocene dromornithids show their reproductive biology had responded to ever-changing climate pressures and that they were breeding sooner than their ancestors did the strategy did not approach the reproductive efficiency shown by large ratite birds today.

For example emu grow to full adult size and breed within 1-2 years. This type of breeding strategy allows their populations to rebound when favourable conditions return after periods of drought or food shortages which could cause population declines.

Osteohistology of Dromornis stirtoni (Aves: Dromornithidae) and the biological implications of the bone histology of the Australian mihirung birds (2022) by A Chinsamy WD Handley and TH Worthy has been published in The Anatomical Record (Wiley) 1–22. https://doi.org/10.1002/ar.25047

AOS,A O Smith,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2plbm5pZmVyLWxvcGV6LWJlbi1hZmZsZWNrLXdlZGRpbmcta2V2aW4tc21pdGgtMjA1NDA2NjI2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kevin Smith calls Jennifer Lopez 'one of the luckiest people on the planet': 'Ben Affleck is a catch',"Kevin Smith can't say if the dress that Jennifer Lopez wore to her first of two wedding celebrations with new husband Ben Affleck was from the poster from Jersey Girl as the internet has been theorizing in recent weeks.

""Maybe it was that I didn't ask"" Smith told Yahoo Entertainment Tuesday at a virtual press day for his latest film Clerks III about the connection being drawn to Jersey Girl the 2004 comedy that he directed and in which the famous duo co-starred (watch above). ""When I saw them I wasn't like 'Hey man can you settle the internet for me? This would be good for my brand!'""

Smith saw the newlyweds at their second wedding this past weekend at Affleck's sprawling estate in Georgia where the power duo was originally going to get married before breaking up in 2004. (The director subsequently cut their wedding scene out of Jersey Girl afraid it would distract viewers.)

This time Smith tells us it was the stuff of a classic Hollywood romance.

""I was so overwhelmed by the wedding itself"" he says. ""I'm a big fat romantic at heart so I love love. And they've got a fantastic love story that now has this beautiful ending – not ending beginning almost. They stuck the landing closed the circle so to speak.

""So I was going by virtue of the fact that 'Yay I get to see what we almost saw many years ago. Good for these kids. They figured it out.' What I got though was profoundly moving. We got a show that a lot of people pay cash money to go see a movie that makes them feel that good. It makes them believe in love… We got it for free man. We just went and watched our friend get married and it was one of the most profoundly beautiful f***ing moments of my life and it didn’t even happen to me.""

Smith was particularly moved watch his longtime friend Affleck whom he first directed in 1995’s Mallrats look so happy. They’ve made several memorable movies together also including Chasing Amy (1997) and Dogma (1999) – though the pair later hit a rough patch before rekindling their friendship and creative partnership when the actor cameo’ed in 2019’s Jay and Silent Bob Reboot. (He also cameos in Clerks III.)

""I've known this cat going on 27 years – we met when he came in to audition for Mallrats and then we became friends"" Smith says. ""He's one of my favorite people on the planet one of my favorite artists one of my favorite writers. That's why I was so blissful during their wedding because they wrote vows together and he wrote a big speech and I was like 'Oooh I'll listen to Ben Affleck read his speech all day long.

""I've seen him be happy. This is a guy who won Oscars… I ain't ever seen a human being let alone him as happy as he was when he was standing there and she's walking [down the aisle]… It was moving. I was bawling from that moment forward.""

Smith only has well-wishes for the happy couple.

""Jennifer Lopez is one of the luckiest people on the planet"" he says. ""She just f***ing got Ben Affleck. Ben Affleck is a catch.""

After writing the fifth Sam Capra novel—a series about a young single father and espionage operative who had his share of personal life crises over the course of the books—I was ready for a break. My next four novels were all standalone psychological thrillers centered on suburban families dealing with dark deep secrets that upended their perfect Facebook-curated lives. And those novels didn’t touch on spies or intel or the high-octane action that marked the Sam Capra books. I kept wanting to go back to writing the next Sam but no idea seemed right for his world. And my publisher liked me writing standalones to help pull in new readers.

So I kept writing and Sam existed in a limbo in the back corner of my brain. Other authors have taken breaks with characters. Not comparing myself to them of course but Arthur Conan Doyle killed off Holmes and then brought him back to life; Josephine Tey gave Inspector Alan Grant two long rests (from 1929-1936 and then again until 1948); John le Carré started off with espionage chief George Smiley in his first two novels in the early 1960s and gave him a break as a main protagonist until bringing him back in 1974 superbly with Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.

A break can be good.

So five years passed. At the end of The First Order the fifth Sam book Sam had gone to work for a back-corner intel group where misfits (or those who had trouble with rules such as Sam) ended up doing the kinds of missions that could be more easily disavowed than if taken on by the traditional agencies and operatives. His son Daniel was a toddler the center of his world but not a character who could feature realistically in many scenes. Father and son were living in New Orleans a quiet life when Sam wasn’t spying or fixing problems or stealing secrets.

But quiet lives don’t stay quiet not in modern American stories especially on television. This is our age of duality where so many characters have a hidden life behind normalcy and comfort. The soft-spoken forensic expert in Dexter is a serial killer who hunts other killers. The nice couple next door in The Americans who own a travel agency are highly trained KGB agents waging a dangerous secret war on our soil. The kindly chemistry teacher in Breaking Bad trying to provide for his family before he dies of cancer transforms into a ruthless kingpin.

And so on. . .duality.

I realized I could do that with Sam—single dad must deal with the twin terrors of espionage and raising a teenager – but I felt for it to work optimally I’d need to take a jump forward in time. Sam needed emotional stakes tied to his suburban life and that was the risk that his son Daniel might learn the truth about their lives—that his father is in reality an intelligence operative going on incredibly dangerous missions and that his mother didn’t die when he was a baby.

If I jumped ahead ten years from the end of that book Daniel would be entering those entertaining teenaged years in middle school maybe at the age to be suspicious of his father’s absences or his father returning from a “business trip” with a broken arm or asking questions about what his mother was really like. All while starting to figure out who he is on his own. I wanted Daniel to be his own character and grow past being a toddler that his father constantly worried about.

Doing this forward leap came at a price though. I was simultaneously passing up ten years of stories with Sam and his (sometimes) espionage partner Mila who was a central character to the series. What had happened between them? Were they still working together? Were they estranged? How had they grown and changed in those ten years? All of that felt like a potential decade of adventure and character development I was just walking away from. It will so sound very odd but I mourned those lost years. It could have been ten years worth of stories—maybe ten novels about Sam and Mila that I would never write. Was I taking an easy way out by accelerating into the future? Was I not doing the hard work of showing the development of the relationship of Sam and his son?

I debated this longer than I needed to. Those ten years could still play a role in the story but shown through the relationships of the characters. Daniel at age thirteen could be the summation of those lost storytelling years—the times Sam wasn’t there the secrets that he’s kept from his son and the moments where father and son are close given the small size of their family. I decided the fracture between Sam and Mila had not been healed—they had each gone about their own lives which gave me a sudden freedom to put them in new and compelling situations both professional and personal.

My chess board was set up but I had not been in Sam’s head in a while. In the series I’ve told stories from both Sam’s first-person perspective and from third person. I chose what suited the story not wanting to be locked into one style or point of view. I went back through the previous books and felt myself settle back into Sam’s unique view of the world. For Traitor’s Dance I chose to stick with third person as I would be moving between three major viewpoint characters.

So after these long years how to start?

I finally decided to open with Sam in his suburban setting (he and Daniel have moved in the past ten years to Austin along with half of America and I put them in Lakehaven the fictitious suburb featured in my recent standalone novels) watching his son play a basketball game when he sees a man he recognizes as a highly dangerous intel operative—an assassin—enter the school gym and Sam knows the only person this man can be there for is…him.

I wanted Sam’s two worlds to collide immediately—he’s watching his target and planning how to eliminate this man if necessary rather than watching Daniel sink a winning basket and Daniel realizes his father’s not paying attention in his moment of triumph. A family moment intertwined with an action “secret life” moment. That would become a pattern in the novel as Sam starts his next mission on finding a missing traitor and Daniel is drawn into his father’s world as he pursues an answer to a mystery of his own.

So if you’re a reader returning to this (or any) series after it’s taken a long break or leap forward in time I hope this is helpful to you in understanding the process of choices a writer can face. (Or just enjoy the story and don’t think on how the sausage is made). If you’re a writer consider every creative choice you could make in your resumption of the series—and whether there are new and exciting dramatic opportunities to raise every stake for your characters. Going back to a series you’ve been away from can feel like a creative restart—it recharged me as a writer and I hope it does the same for you.

to deliver superior pain relief and is preferred to traditional ""tingling"" tonic stimulation by 87% of patients The Proclaim Plus SCS System can be used in conjunction with Abbott's NeuroSphere™ Virtual Clinic which allows people to connect with their doctor and receive remote programming adjustments from the comfort of their home*

ABBOTT PARK Ill. Aug. 23 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Abbott (NYSE: ABT) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved its new Proclaim™ Plus spinal cord stimulation (SCS) system featuring FlexBurst360™ therapy. The next generation of Abbott's proprietary BurstDR™ stimulation FlexBurst360 therapy offers pain coverage across up to six areas of the trunk and/or limbs and enables programming that can be adjusted as a person's therapeutic needs evolve.

Designed to fit within a person's life the Proclaim Plus SCS system is recharge-free with a battery that can last up to 10 years.^ It can be used with Abbott's NeuroSphere™ Virtual Clinic connected care technology which allows a person to both communicate with a physician through secure in-app video chat and remotely receive stimulation settings in real time regardless of location.*

More than 50 million people in the U.S. suffer from chronic pain5 and 88% of those have pain in at least two or more different areas of their body.6 SCS therapy also known as neurostimulation is an implanted device that sends mild electrical pulses to the nerves along the spinal cord changing the way the body perceives pain signals which can relieve chronic pain and improve quality of life. According to the U.S. Pain Foundation chronic pain is the leading cause of people going to the doctor and costs the nation approximately $635 billion each year in healthcare disability and lost productivity costs.7

""Spinal cord stimulation has provided tremendous relief for patients suffering from chronic pain. With its ability to mimic natural patterns found in the brain the Abbott BurstDR platform has been a game-changer in this space helping to not only improve a patient's ability to perform everyday activities but also relieve the emotional suffering§ that pain can cause"" said Steven Falowski M.D. Argires Marotti Neurosurgical Associates of Lancaster Lancaster Pa. ""However despite the many benefits of BurstDR such as being effective as a low-energy stimulation therapy some patients continue to be burdened by pain because of multiple painful areas and evolving pain over time. Now with Proclaim Plus and FlexBurst360 an already established platform has been improved to treat more patients who suffer from pain across different body parts and changing pain over time.""

BurstDR therapy is Abbott's exclusive stimulation technology that delivers pulses – or bursts – of mild electrical energy to alter pain signals as they travel from the spinal cord to the brain. Clinical studies have shown that BurstDR technology delivers superior pain relief as compared to tonic stimulation3 improves people's day-to-day life and reduces the emotional suffering§ associated with pain.4 When compared to standard tonic stimulation technology which provides a constant tingling sensation felt by the patient 87% of people preferred BurstDR technology which provides pain relief in a sub-sensory range not felt by the patient.4

Using FlexBurst360 therapy on the Proclaim Plus system physicians can identify the lowest effective dose of stimulation for each patient and adapt it based on evolving pain needs. The system allows doctors control over multiple independent BurstDR stimulation areas to provide broader pain coverage without overstimulation risk.8

The Proclaim Plus system with FlexBurst360 therapy is designed to fit seamlessly within a person's life and therapy settings can be accessed using either a personal mobile device** or through an Abbott-provided mobile device. Patients can use the same device to access Abbott's proprietary NeuroSphere Virtual Clinic a first-of-its-kind neurostimulation technology9 in the U.S. that allows patients to communicate with physicians ensure proper functionality of their device and receive remote adjustments to their therapeutic settings as needed.

""At Abbott we are deeply committed to advancing the field of neurostimulation thus helping people address the challenges they face while managing their chronic pain"" said Pedro Malha vice president neuromodulation Abbott. ""Our latest development Proclaim Plus with FlexBurst360 therapy is yet another testament of that commitment.""

* Anywhere with a cellular or Wi-Fi connection and sufficiently charged patient controller.

^Up to 10 years of battery longevity at the lowest program setting: 0.6mA 500 Ohms duty cycle 30s on/360s off single area BurstDR stimulation. Refer to the IFU for additional information.

That’s the finding of a new AbbVie survey dubbed the Emotional Impact Report which wants to help plug this gap and help those newly diagnosed get the support they need.

All cancer patients face the daunting challenge of dealing with their diagnosis but CLL patients have extra burdens: This disease is a slow-growing form of blood cancer and due to its complexities patients and healthcare providers responding to the survey indicated a need for greater support at the time of diagnosis.

While the emotional impact of a cancer diagnosis is always difficult a CLL diagnosis is unique in that there is often a long wait period before treatment even begins. It’s a lot of watching and waiting. Therefore people with CLL go through a roller coaster of emotions as they deal with their diagnosis for many years.

“We recognize a diagnosis of cancer may have a great emotional impact on everyone involved especially patients” an AbbVie spokesperson said in an interview.

“Our Emotional Impact Report survey was developed with a focus on CLL because we feel there is significant opportunity to improve the quality of conversations around the emotional and mental health aspects of a CLL diagnosis among patients caregivers and HCPs.”

AbbVie markets two top-selling drugs targeting CLL. The first product Venclexta is a BCL-2 inhibitor that made its debut in 2016 for the treatment of patients with relapsed CLL caused by a particular genetic mutation.

The second product Imbruvica is a BTK inhibitor launched in 2013 and the current leader in the second-line CLL market.

The Emotional Impact Report findings showed a majority (70%) of HCPs feel treating CLL patients differs from treating other cancer patients.

As one patient shared “the hardest part with living with CLL is that I know that I have cancer but it is not being treated. In my case watch and wait is the best place to be but it can be hard at times.”

According to the survey some of the emotions following an initial CLL diagnosis include worried (32%) uncertain (36%) tired (36%) optimistic (36%) and hopeful (41%). While what the average patient goes through will fluctuate only 64% reported feeling supported by their doctor when initially diagnosed.

“Our aim with releasing the survey findings is to spark important discussions on emotional well-being among HCPs patients and caregivers as they move through all stages of their CLL journey” said the AbbVie spokesperson. While 71% of HCPs said they are likely to discuss the emotional impact of CLL with their patients “we know there are always additional opportunities to better support patients and caregivers” the spokesperson added.

For caregivers interviewed in the survey 81% feel positive about caring for someone with CLL yet nearly 3 in 4 state that being a caregiver is more difficult than expected.

AbbVie currently offers support to patients and caregivers via its LivingwithCLL.com website which offers information about CLL and helps individuals better understand treatment options such as fixed-duration therapy. The website also provides tips for patient or caregiver discussions with their physicians.

The pharma also partners with patient advocacy groups to help support their patient education initiatives and is in discussions with several of these organizations about the findings of the Emotional Impact Report to identify new educational tools to support CLL patients’ and caregivers’ emotional well-being and mental health.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wbncuZWR1L3B1cmR1ZS1ub3J0aHdlc3QtcHJvZmVzc29ycy1jb2xsYWJvcmF0aW9uLXdpdGgtaW5kdXN0cnktYWJidmllLWF3YXJkZWQtbmF0aW9uYWwtc2NpZW5jZS1mb3VuZGF0aW9ucy1wYXJ0bmVyc2hpcC1mb3ItaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi1ncmFudC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Purdue Northwest professor's collaboration with industry (AbbVie) awarded National Science Foundation's Partnership ...,"Purdue Northwest professor’s collaboration with industry (AbbVie) awarded National Science Foundation’s Partnership for Innovation Grant

August 24 2022

Magesh Chandramouli professor of Computer Graphics Technology in the Purdue University Northwest (PNW) College of Technology and Nandkishor Nere research fellow from AbbVie were awarded the National Science Foundation (NSF) Partnership for Innovation (PFI) Grant. This technology translation supports commercial potential demonstration projects for academic research outputs in NSF-funded science and engineering disciplines. Chandramouli and Nere in support of their research were awarded a grant of $247000.

“I have been fortunate to be involved as the principal investigator and collaborator in projects involving the use of virtual reality and augmented reality (VR/AR) for education and training” says Chandramouli. “Using the knowledge and experience from earlier VR projects this work will build an innovative framework to offer Specialized Process Equipment (SPE) training in pharmaceuticals manufacturing.”

Under a partnership between Purdue Northwest and AbbVie a global biopharmaceutical company Chandramouli hopes to develop a VR/AR training framework to address the lack of trained workforce in API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient) manufacturing a critical factor to ensure uninterrupted drug manufacturing and supply.

“I will be serving as the principal investigator (PI) on this project and Dr. Nandkishor Nere from AbbVie will serve as the Co-PI” said Chandramouli. “Mr. Chris Beck CEO of Innovative 3D manufacturing will serve as the commercialization expert and Dr. Lana Rucks (Rucks Group) will serve as the external evaluator for the project.”

Due to the lack of advanced manufacturing operator training practices numerous Pharma Manufacturing positions may go unfilled despite the projected growth in the Pharma workforce by 33%. If not addressed this skills gap might impact drug supply chains.

COVID-19 has unmistakably demonstrated the need to revamp API manufacturing to meet large scale demand. “VR/AR operator training applications such as this program have the potential to result in significant cost savings while enabling prompt delivery of life-saving drugs” said Chandramouli. “This needs to be achieved through proof-of-concept prototyping technology development and/or scale-up work.”

PNW is playing a pivotal role in promoting innovation in the Northwest Indiana community and is actively involved in many collaborative efforts with industry to economically and socially strengthen the region.

“Effective training of API manufacturing operators is key to having seamless production of high-quality medicines in optimal time and the proposed research strives to address this vital need” said Nere.

“This specific project is a much-needed application that not only can train a skilled workforce in the Pharma industry but can also significantly save money time and resources thus enabling speedy and sufficient medicine delivery to patients” Chandramouli observes. “This work endeavors to address the skills gap in API manufacturing with the ultimate goal of promoting socio-economic gains.”

Chandramouli attributes the success of this grant approval and prior projects to the team that diligently works alongside him in the College of Technology and the PNW Research and Sponsored Programs Office. In all projects including this Chandramouli says he strives to integrate research with his teaching involving students at every possible level and by providing real-time project experience that can enrich their college experience.

“The College of Technology promotes collaborative efforts for active engagement with industry” said Chandramouli. “Any federal funding is a team effort which is the culmination of concerted efforts that started way back in a much smaller manner. I am thankful for the continued support to these kinds of active industry engagement efforts by the College of Technology which especially played an important role in this grant funding.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIyMDgyMzAwNTE4OS9lbi9HYXRlLU5ldXJvc2NpZW5jZXMtRW1lcmdlcy1mcm9tLVN0ZWFsdGgtd2l0aC1hLVBvcnRmb2xpby1vZi1OZXh0LUdlbmVyYXRpb24tVGhlcmFwaWVzLWZvci1DZW50cmFsLU5lcnZvdXMtU3lzdGVtLURpc2Vhc2Vz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gate Neurosciences Emerges from Stealth with a Portfolio of Next-Generation Therapies for Central Nervous System ...,"CARMEL Ind.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Gate Neurosciences today announced it has officially launched to develop its next-generation therapeutics addressing synaptic dysfunction in patients suffering from central nervous system (CNS) disorders.

Gate was founded in 2019 by a team of neuroscience industry veterans to address the increasingly urgent need for more effective treatments for CNS disorders and to overcome long-standing challenges in CNS drug development. Since its founding the company has acquired a robust portfolio of next-generation compounds from large pharma along with corresponding data from thousands of patients dosed across numerous clinical trials that will inform and de-risk future development.

“We formed Gate to bring forward precision medicine approaches to CNS disorders such as biomarkers and enrichment for responders similar to the early days of targeted oncology drug development” remarked Anantha Shekhar co-founder of Gate Neurosciences and Senior Vice Chancellor for Health Sciences and Dean of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. “Gate’s lead programs are supported by a uniquely robust package of clinical and translational data across thousands of patients and we’re excited to continue advancing the molecules using deep precision insights.”

The company is focused on developing novel mechanisms that address synaptic dysfunction underlying neuropsychiatric and cognitive disorders including major depressive disorder (MDD). Gate’s lead programs stem from a platform of novel NMDA receptor modulators that have demonstrated rapid durable and safe outcomes across multiple published and unpublished clinical studies. The company’s unique mechanism represents a more direct and well-tolerated approach to enhancing synaptic function and neuroplasticity compared to ketamine and other next-generation rapid antidepressants.

“Current therapies for mental health disorders are extremely inadequate and patients need better options. There has never been more evidence that enhancing underlying synaptic function is the ideal therapeutic approach” commented Mike McCully Chief Executive Officer at Gate. “We believe our novel synaptic modulators are the most potent and proven compounds that enhance synaptic function to achieve rapid durable and safe outcomes with potential across a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders.”

Gate’s lead program Zelquistinel is an oral 3rd generation NMDAR modulator that was discovered by Naurex and advanced into the clinic by Allergan before its acquisition by AbbVie. To date Zelquistinel has completed multiple Phase 1 EEG biomarker studies and an initial Phase 2a dose exploration study in MDD. Gate also acquired global rights to the 2nd generation NMDAR modulator Apimostinel which the company is developing for acute psychiatric indications based on a large 24-hour effect size observed in a Phase 2a proof-of-concept study. These programs are supported by a deep de-risking translational data package including over 500 patients dosed with Apimostinel and Zelquistinel across multiple clinical studies to inform future development of the molecules.

The company’s development plans for Zelquistinel and Apimostinel also leverage key learnings from the first-generation NMDAR molecule Rapastinel (Glyx-13) which demonstrated proof-of-concept across multiple clinical MDD studies in over 2000 patients combined. Gate is collaborating with psychiatry leaders to continue exploring Rapastinel in investigator-led clinical studies given its established safety profile and the company’s more advanced understanding of Rapastinel’s dose dynamics.

Gate will provide a strategic business update in the coming weeks that will provide additional information on its diverse development portfolio and major recent and upcoming milestones. Further details on the company’s portfolio may be found on Gate’s website gateneuro.com

The partnership began in 2019 with the establishment of a digital factory. Under the banner of DIVA — digital innovation ventures and analytics — the factory was launched to help Changi Airport develop experiment and deploy new digital products and services from conceptualisation to market roll-out.

Housed with experts from both Accenture and Changi Airport DIVA leverages new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) digital marketing big data and analytics predictive maintenance and the Internet of Things (IoT).

The new agreement sees both parties leverage technologies such as extended reality machine learning IoT and edge computing to enable Changi Airport to seamlessly engage travellers at various touch points prior to arriving at the airport to after they leave. Knowledge and skills transfer to the CAG team are to be expected as well.

“We have been working closely with CAG to implement digital enhancements and infuse a culture of experimentation” said Ng Wee Wei country managing director of Singapore at Accenture.

“As the line between the physical and digital continues to blur organisations have the opportunity to address issues like trust sustainability safety responsible access and use diversity and more helping set the stage for the future. We see many new possibilities to bring even more immersive collaborative personalised and meaningful experiences to CAG’s customers.”

Adopting a customer-centric approach based on rapid prototyping Accenture and CAG will jointly design and roll-out new digital products across Changi Airport.

One product is a new loyalty platform that will enable customers to earn points for both spending and travelling redeem loyalty points across channels in one place and provide more redemption choices encouraging customers to stay engaged and connected.

By integrating data from various sources the platform will allow Changi Airport to understand its customers better enabling the company to provide them with highly personalised communications experiences and offers.

“Changi Airport Group has always put our customers first; constantly enhancing the airport experience and pleasantly delighting our customers even when they are not travelling” affirmed Hung Jean group senior vice president for Enterprise Digital Ecosystem & Business at CAG.

“In this next phase of our digital transformation journey how we deliver the unique Changi experience whether offline or online to our customers remains key.

The board’s three Democrats voted to approve a contract with Accenture LLP to prepare a long-term “guiding document” in the words of Deputy County Manager Jimmy Gisi to pull together a number of service issues and objectives.

Those include according to an agenda item:

“A world-wide pandemic justice reform affordable housing and employee retention are just a few of these challenges. The strategic plan will be the primary strategy to lead the on-going vision and priorities of Cobb County. The plan will include measurable objectives to help improve the County’s responsiveness to the public to adapt to changes in the economy to remain competitive to welcome tourists to sustain the County’s assets and to recommend a unified vision for years to come.”

Republicans JoAnn Birrell and Keli Gambrill voted against objecting to the cost and questioning the need for such a study.

“I know there is a need for a strategic plan” Birrell said “but to spend $1.4 million with all the other studies that we have going on. A million here a million there. I cannot support it.”

Gisi told her the county negotiated down the cost with Accenture whose initial bid was $1.8 million. The process is expected to take through the end of the year and will include public engagement produce a long-range vision (10-20 years) and and five-year plan from 2023-2027.

Accenture a management and professional services consulting firm would employ eight of its staffers on the Cobb strategic plan project and would need space for up to five of its staffers at county government offices as well as parking.

(More about the project summary can be found by clicking here; Accenture’s “statement of work” can be found by clicking here.)

Gambrill said the county hasn’t taken any steps to implement a five-year plan that was laid out by former Cobb Commission Chairman Mike Boyce in 2017.

“I can’t support this and I don’t expect a rebuttal” she said.

But County Manager Jackie McMorris told her that was simply about restoring county services to pre-recession levels.

“We’ve never done a five-year financial plan” McMorris said referencing Boyce’s aspirations for what he called providing services for a “five-star county.”

Chairwoman Lisa Cupid was eager to approve the contract saying “we finally have something we can say will help provide guidance” on establishing long-term objectives.

During a public comment period East Cobb resident Leroy Emkin blasted the spending proposal saying such a study should be conducted by county department heads.

Cupid responded by saying that “while we have competent employees at Cobb County this project is outside their area of expertise.”

Commissioner Jerica Richardson of District 2 said before the vote that “it’s vital that this is truly strategic and comprehensive.”

Accenture’s statement of work calls for public engagement sessions in October and long-range vision document by the end of October a five-year strategic draft in November and the finalized five-year document by December.

ADBE,Adobe,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBldGFsdW1hMzYwLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3Mvb2xkLWFkb2JlLXNjaG9vbC1kaXN0cmljdC1oaXJlcy0yLWNvLXN1cGVyaW50ZW5kZW50cy1hbWlkLWZpbmFuY2lhbC1jb25jZXJuL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Old Adobe school district hires 2 co-superintendents amid financial concerns,"Board member Doris Tolks and board President Patsy Knight did not submit applications for reelection leaving their two seats open. Newcomers Scott McKenna and Peter Walsh seek to fill those vacancies both of whom are also running unopposed.

Current board members Adriana Smith and Anna Dietrich will seek reelection to their four-year terms as Board member Kimberly Shaver will look to maintain her two-year term.

Each seat on the five-person Old Adobe Union School District Board of Trustees will be up for election Nov. 8 with all candidates running unopposed according to the Sonoma County Registrar’s Office.

Old Adobe Union School District started the 2022-23 school year Aug. 17 with two new co-superintendents following a monthslong search to fill the role that has now seen five people at its helm since the start of the calendar year.

While the position of district superintendent has historically been held by a single person co-superintendents Michele Gochberg and Cindy Friberg assumed their roles June 8. Their tenure follows an abrupt and expensive exit in January by the district’s most recent long-term superintendent and amid concerns the district may not meet its financial obligations.

“I think this is cutting edge” said Patsy Knight president of the district’s Board of Trustees when asked why the board chose to hire two superintendents.

Both Gochberg and Friberg are familiar faces within the district one thing Knight said the board appreciated as they already held an understanding of the district’s challenges teachers and community.

“We share core values one of which that there’s nothing more important than the work we do on behalf of the students” Friberg said.

Friberg has worked at the district for over three years as the leader of its student services department a role that will be absorbed into her responsibilities as co-superintendent.

She has previously worked with Petaluma City Schools and the Marin County Office of Education as program manager and is a licensed educational psychologist.

Gochberg has served as a teacher at three of the district’s schools before becoming a curriculum resource instructor and instructional coach. In 2013 she became principal of the district’s Sonoma Mountain Elementary Charter School.

“One of our strengths is our relationships with our staff” Gochberg said.

Both reside in Petaluma outside the Old Adobe district’s boundaries and have children. Gochberg’s children attend the district while Friberg’s attend their neighborhood’s district.

According to Knight promoting from within the district was intentional.

“We knew the characteristics we wanted and then we started thinking about the candidates” Knight said.

Knight said the board “researched” and “consulted people” about the potential of hiring two superintendents — opposed to one — for the district which is comprised of six elementary schools has around 2000 students and roughly 250 employees.

Steve Herrington superintendent of the Sonoma County Office of Education said he’s never seen dual-superintendents on a district level in his 40-year career as an administrator in California public schools.

According to previous reporting former Old Adobe Superintendent Sonjhia Lowery who took the job in July 2020 was bought out of her contract in January. She left after a lengthy struggle with the Old Adobe Teacher’s Association which gave her a no-confidence vote in April 2021. Diane Wolmuth president of the association went as far as to call on the board to fire Lowery a few weeks before her departure.

According to former Board of Trustees member Matthew Burton many members of the Old Adobe Teachers Association “didn’t like Lowery from the moment she took the job.” Burton told the Petaluma Argus-Courier earlier this month that some faculty viewed her as an outsider and were not welcoming toward her.

Kinyatta Reynolds a former PE instructor and educator in the district said in a recent interview with the Argus-Courier that teachers complained that Lowery did not spend enough time on campus and didn’t learn their names even though she took over during the pandemic and was commuting daily from outside Sonoma County.

Both Burton and Reynolds have said they resigned from their positions due to “toxicity” within the district.

According to previous reporting by the Argus-Courier Lowery received $203386.44 as part of her separation agreement which represented 10 months of salary as well as vacation pay and benefits.

Former Old Adobe Superintendent Craig Conte was brought back after Lowery left and paid $48428 for just two months since his salary reached the retiree earnings cap.

Kris Cosca former interim superintendent of the district then took over the role March 16 to finish out the school year. Cosca said his salary was based on “Step 3” of the superintendent pay scale a per diem that came out to about $886 and totaled over $50000 by his departure in early June.

Cosca said he initially applied for the position while he was interim superintendent but withdrew before the interview process began because he wanted to change career paths.

According to their contracts Gochberg and Friberg are each receiving an annual base salary of $190346.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByb3ZpZGVvY29hbGl0aW9uLmNvbS9hZG9iZS1wcmVtaWVyZS1wcm8tdXBkYXRlZC10by12ZXJzaW9uLTIyLTYv0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucHJvdmlkZW9jb2FsaXRpb24uY29tL2Fkb2JlLXByZW1pZXJlLXByby11cGRhdGVkLXRvLXZlcnNpb24tMjItNi9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Adobe Premiere Pro updated to version 22.6 by Scott Simmons - ProVideo Coalition,"Over the last 24 to 48 hours Adobe has quietly rolled out an Adobe Premiere Pro update to version 22.6. It’s not a huge update and I don’t see any real must-have features unless you’re heavily into creating graphics with the Essential Graphics panel. I updated this morning and the update did not ask me to update the next project file I opened so this version doesn’t change the project structure.

As always this is the place to remind you that you should never update in the middle of a project but we know some folks will so if you do then do it right.

Here’s the bullet points for this update:

Finer masking controls for titles

Apparently there are new options for masking when you’re building out graphics in the Essential Graphics panel. I have to admit that I don’t do as much graphic designing in the Essential Graphics panel as I should. I often forget that you can multiple layers to any graphic clip created in the timeline.

And that includes importing images from a file.

This From File… option is not new but the ways you can mask with text files and shapes is new.



I have to remember to explore this more.

Context menu for text and shapes

It’s a small thing but it’ll be nice to be able to open the Essential Graphics panel right from a graphic in the Program window.

I’m all for making things easier and since PPro is a very panel-driven tool I’ll take this shortcut. Is it worthy of the second marketing point? 🤷‍♂️

Export titles as text files from the Graphics tab

It is nice to be able to export titles into a document for proofreading copy/pasting and backup.

I could have sworn this was already there and I did this just the other day. But that was in the Caption tab so maybe I’m mistaken.

Adjustable Fades for Audio Ducking Any kind of audio ducking where your NLE auto-magically lowers audio in part of your music clips (or any clips doesn’t have to be music but it’s usually music) can be a time saver but 99% of the time I have to tweak the results manually. A new Fade Position slider might make that a bit less manual tweaking. Combine that new Fade Position with Fade Duration and I think you should be able to dial it in pretty close. Now I just have to remember this is there and not just do it all manually by force of habit. GPU improvements The Unsharp Mask and Posterzie Time effects are now GPU accelerated. There’s also a new progress bar that is this from the Adobe August 2022 release feature summary: “On the first launch after a new installation or driver update Premiere Pro needs to initialize the GPU. A new progress bar shows when this is happening. ” Well okay then. It’s also very important to note some of the bug fixes and fixed issues in this update: Unexpected overlapping of Tool Tips in Import Mode.

Improved Tab Navigation in Import Mode.

Media Browser cannot open a sequence containing unlinked audio in Source Monitor.

Productions allowed access to Interpret footage from the sequence project without opening the project where the master clip is stored.

Export: Set Start Timecode checkbox does not enable on initial mouse click.

Copy/Paste ignores clip on locked/targeted tracks.

The shared project in Productions does not update when selecting Read-Write mode.

Missing caption segments when SRT with lines with the only period is imported.

Changing a source clip label in production can crash the application.

Mac Only: AVCHD spanned clips with AC-3 audio have audio missing.

They will be joined by the mounted volunteers of Solano County Sheriff’s Posse and their horses at the Peña Adobe Historical Society’s open house a free event from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the tree-shaded park.

The Buffalo Soldiers are a living history group that was established in the Sacramento area almost 30 years ago. The group recreates the Black cavalry units that served in the Old West from 1867 to 1896.

The goal of Company G members is to tell the story of the Buffalo Soldiers’ history while visiting schools community organizations churches and public events.

For the open house they will have artifacts of the Buffalo Soldiers’ history on display and members dressed in period uniforms will be on hand to talk with park visitors.

The Black soldiers derived their “Buffalo” nickname from American Indians who came in contact with them. The units began with an 1866 law authorizing the Army to form cavalry and infantry regiments of Black men under the command at the time of white officers. Their primary mission was controlling Indians in the Western frontier. The soldiers took part in almost 200 engagements.

By all accounts the Buffalo Soldiers were noted for their courage and discipline having one of the Army’s lowest desertion and court-martial rates. One of the 10th Cavalry’s officers was John J. Pershing whose moniker was Black Jack a reflection of his advocacy of Black troops. Pershing a West Point graduate who later became a General of the Armies is best known for leading the American Expeditionary Forces on the Western Front during World War I.

The Sheriff’s Posse has been part of the Solano County Sheriff’s Office for more than 70 years. Volunteers use their horses and equipment to help with search-and-rescue efforts emergency services and as public ambassadors.

Music will be provided by the Vacaville Jammers. Under the direction of Leslie and Terry Clopper the ensemble based at the McBride Center in Vacaville are a group of musicians who play acoustic instruments and sing together.

The historic Peña Adobe built by pioneer Juan Felipe Peña in 1842 will be open for tours. The park is also home to the one-room Mowers-Goheen Museum which displays items of the area’s early history. It will be open to visitors.

Peña Adobe Park at 4699 Pena Adobe Road is off Interstate 80 and left of the Lagoon Valley Park entrance.

Ester Hammond purchased and paid for the preservation of the Hill/Carrillo Adobe architect Louise McVhay completely renovated the Gonzalez/Ramirez adobe to reflect her vision of a romantic ranch house and Irene and Bernhard Hoffmann preserved the De la Guerra Adobe while creating a charming faux Mexican village known today as El Paseo. They also preserved the Lugo adobe but like McVhay “improved” its architecture to reflect a fictious vision of the past.

Into this mix came architect John William Chard a descendent of a pioneering California family. Chard’s grandfather New York born William George Chard had traveled the Santa Fe Trail to arrive in Los Angeles in company with other trappers and traders in 1832-33. With a partner he established a soap factory and vineyard on the San Gabriel River before moving north in 1837 to try his luck in Santa Barbara. For a short time he worked as a trader and otter hunter on the coast and stayed in the Channel City long enough to become a naturalized Mexican citizen before moving on to Santa Cruz.

On December 3 1839 he converted to Catholicism and was baptized at Mission Carmel as “Jorge Guillermo Chard.” One month later he married the young Maria Estefana Robles at Santa Cruz. In 1844 Chard received a Mexican land grant of some 13000 acres in Tehama County on the western bank of the Sacramento River. He named it Rancho de las Flores and constructed a log cabin which he called “Sacramento House.” In 1857 fire destroyed the dwelling and Maria almost died. Vaqueros on the ranch had to chop a hole in the wall to get her out. Valuable papers were burned as well as cherished relics of the days of Spain. When they rebuilt they rebuilt with tried-and-true fireproof Mexican adobe.

Maria and William’s first-born son Joseph William Chard was born in 1841. As he grew up Joseph ran stock and farmed on the family’s ranch in Tehama but by 1879 he had moved to Montecito and found work as a butcher. In 1880 he married Dina Garcia and they moved onto a portion of the 1820 Garcia family land grant in Montecito’s Cold Spring Canyon. John William Chard born the following year was their first child. Ten would follow.

Though several of their children were born at the homestead in the canyon Dina was deathly afraid of rattlesnakes and feared that one of her children might be bitten in this viperous environment. By 1894 she apparently had said “enough” and the family moved to Carrillo Street in town and later to 1129 San Pascual Street.

The Adobe Architect

In 1921 Chard designed this adobe home on Garden Street for John W. Heaney a local attorney

About 1904 the eldest son John William Chard headed for San Francisco where he joined his brother Alonzo and other Chard relatives in working for Shreve & Co a silversmithing firm. By 1915 he had become an architect most likely through an apprenticeship. He returned to Santa Barbara moved in with the family at 1129 San Pascual and built himself an apartment attached to the garage where he spent his days drawing architectural designs. He also threw himself into the civic life of the town and became involved with the Hikers the Progressive Business Club Neighborhood House and other organizations.

A native son of California with both Spanish and American heritage Chard had probably heard the story of his grandmother’s near immolation on Rancho de las Flores and the conflagration that took his Uncle Stephen’s house in Red Bluff. His own family had lived in an adobe house in Cold Spring Canyon so it is no wonder that Chard’s architectural specialty turned to the reintroduction of adobe bricks as a viable building medium. By 1916 he was already being referred to as “the adobe architect.”

In 1917 to prove the worth of adobe in the construction of houses he decided to build an adobe house on the family plot at 1129 San Pascual Street as a demonstration of the advantages of using adobe bricks. He had created new techniques and equipment for creating and laying the bricks special waterproofing to insure against deterioration and methods for reinforcement.

Adobe he opined was economical and usually found on the building site. It was also fireproof and non-conductive and it provided insulation against both heat and cold. It was everlasting and soundproof. In addition adobe buildings expressed something of the native beauty and romance of Southern California. His promotional campaign was convincing and he was asked to add a chapter on “Adobe Buildings” to a 134-page report on city building ordinances.

In 1918 Harry H. Webb a famous and wealthy mining engineer commissioned John Chard to design an adobe home for his family in Montecito on Summit Road on a lot adjoining the new lands of the Santa Barbara Country Club. Chard created a scale model for the house complete with electric lights and a miniature garden which was on display at his office in town and drew a notable amount of attention. Shirley Kunze his niece remembers this model which came to reside in the yard at 1129 San Pascual Street. It fascinated her as a child with its tiny architectural details and she and her sister used to play with it as children. Unfortunately years of weather did their worst and it became a ruin.

Chard designed the adobe family home on San Pascual Street to demonstrate the value of using adobe as a building medium

Chard’s exquisite 1926 adobe house for Walter Candy in Pasadena has been designated a historic landmark (photo by Michael Locke) Chard designed one hundred small adobe homes for the Walnut Park subdivision of the Cudahy rancho. National Builder featured them in an August 1920 article touting the use of modern adobe.

Chard’s landscaping design for the gardens stretched down the hill to today’s Old Coast Highway and became part of the beautiful views from a Moorish court and roof pergola. The two-story house had eight bedrooms and nine bathrooms a servants’ wing a library a conservatory an electric elevator and capacious fireplaces. An article in the Morning Press at the time said “In keeping with Chard’s esthetic ornamentation on the exterior will be modest in design and the entire effect shows good taste.” Webb dubbed his California home Solbrillo (bright sunshine).

Another of Chard’s early commissions was an adobe house on the crest of the hill on 10 acres at the end of Anapamu Street. The owner Hermann F. Sexauer was invested in several lots in the area and lived nearby. He named the house Sol y Mar. At one point he rented it to a Romanian couple Petru and Madame Bochescu who established a restaurant art gallery and playhouse called Vagabondia.

Opening night saw a host of societal luminaries gathered for a savory evening of entertainment. After Madame Bochescu had worked her magic in the kitchen Petru wearing a Romanian shirt with red sash and headdress read his two one-act plays from in front of the great fireplace in the living room. The splashing of water from the courtyard fountain helped set the mood. The

magical enterprise lasted about a month before the Bochescus went vagabonding and disappeared into the anonymity of pre-internet America. In 1920 Sexauer sold the house to Mr. and Mrs. George McConnell who lived there several years.

Chard’s reputation grew and in 1919 he was hired to design 100 small adobe houses for the subdivision of the Cudahy Walnut Land Company near Los Angeles. Today this area is known as Walnut Park. Coincidentally three Cudahy sisters lived in Montecito. They would be the main financers of the adobe-style Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church (which is not made of adobe) in the 1930s. The small houses of Walnut Park were touted as being of artistic design combined with utility and livableness.

In 1920 Chard partnered with Handy L. Wass. They designed a home for Mary R. Dennison on the property of the former Boyland school on the Riviera. She was the widow of the president of the Dennison Manufacturing Company of Framingham Massachusetts. The adobe house was to have 20 rooms and elegant servants’ quarters. Mary was soon involved in Santa Barbara society and travelled extensively.

In 1921 the firm of Wass and Chard built an adobe home for John William Heaney at 2241 Garden Street. In 1922 Chard and Wass dissolved their partnership and Chard designed an adobe home for Ludmilla Pilat Welch and her sister Anna Pilat Knight. They planned to build it themselves in the Fellowship Colony on the Mesa and for the most part they did. Chard’s design included a tiled roof large studio living room bedrooms breakfast room kitchen dressing room bathrooms and large porch and sunroom.

By 1924 Chard had left Santa Barbara to explore opportunities in Los Angeles and Pasadena where he is credited with at least two adobe homes the landmarked Walter Candy House in Oak Knoll Pasadena and the Thomas M. Miller House in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles. Chard married and lived and worked in the Los Angeles area until about 1950 when he now a widower returned to San Francisco to live with his brother Alonzo.

Chard on Adobe

In the early 1920s John William Chard’s reputation was soaring. A contemporary article in Sunset Magazine touts the use of adobe and Chard. The author writes “The man who perfected the adobe brick making possible a new type of construction is a Spaniard John William Chard an architect of Santa Barbara California. Living in an adobe the greater part of his life he not only made a study of Spanish architecture in all its aspects but experiments with adobe in the belief that it could be made a practical and economical building material.”

In 1958-59 Richard E. Brown of Connecticut then owner of Solbrillo placed it on the market for $75000. His “for sale by owner” brochure showed photos and floor plans. (Montecito Association History Committee)

Chard himself wrote an article for California Southland in 1922 entitled “Some Suggestions for Small Houses.” As the fad for Spanish Colonial Revival architecture went viral Chard had seen only a few examples of good architecture “scattered in a maze of bewildering imitations importations and perverted originalities.” When he first heard of the Community Arts Association’s vision for a uniform Spanish Colonial architectural style therefore he was cynical but soon became an ardent devotee of the movement. He was especially pleased with plans for a small house competition that would promote better architecture and make esthetically pleasing designs available to the small house builder.

“A badly designed house loses the opportunity to contribute to the general value and beauty of the community” he wrote. The elimination of all unnecessary ornamentations protrusions and imitations he believed was paramount. He became an active volunteer when the Community Arts Plans and Planting Branch created the Architectural Board of Review which offered architectural advice and plans from qualified designers to the public.

After Chard moved to Los Angeles he had a regular radio show in which he talked about architecture specifically adobe. As time passed however the popularity of adobe construction dried up and 1942 found Chard working for Douglas Aircraft corporation in El Segundo. John William Chard died in San Francisco where his brother Alonzo S. Chard was living. He is interred at Goleta Cemetery.

While the corporate world in general was negatively impacted by the pandemic the widespread technology adoption triggered by the crisis came as a double-edged sword for semiconductor companies.

Most chipmakers witnessed a surge in orders as the digital shift gained steam — mainly to meet the remote-work/study requirements and facilitate the mass migration of workloads to cloud networks. On the other hand the companies struggle to meet the high demand due to short supply of raw materials and choked supply chains. Though recovery is picking up amid improvements in the pandemic situation the continuing chip shortage remains a concern.

Ailing Titan

The market headwinds came as a setback for Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) since the chip giant has been losing market share to its competitors lately. Also INTC was left out when tech stocks recouped a part of the losses they suffered in the market selloff casting doubts over the company’s ability to meet its ambitious five-year plan.

In a dismal show Intel posted weak revenues and profit for the June quarter that fell short of expectations. Adjusted earnings plunged 79% annually to $0.29 per share hurt by a 22% fall in revenues to $15.3 billion. The stock fell sharply soon after the announcement in late July and languished at a multi-year low since then.

Intel Corporation Q2 2022 Earnings Call Transcript

The stock has lost about 35% so far this year dragging down investor sentiment amid fears that it might not regain the lost strength in the near future. Interestingly from the investment perspective the only bright spot is the cheap valuation. But investors might not find it attractive because better options are available.

Making Inroads

The growing demand for high-tech semiconductor products – supported by new technologies like AI and deep learning– is ushering the semiconductor industry into a new era where players with advanced technology will get a significant advantage. It seems Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) knows the pulse of the market better than others. The company continues to grab market share from Intel on the power of its futuristic products and innovation. As a result it has consistently generated stronger revenues and earnings with the bottom-line beating estimates almost every quarter in the recent past. In the second quarter revenues surged 70% year-over-year to $6.6 billion driving up adjusted profit to $1.05 per share which is up 67%.

The good news is that the moderation in AMD’s market capitalization — thanks to the market selloff — has created a great investment opportunity that is significant because the stock is expected to make solid gains going forward. The management believes that growth would accelerate in the coming quarters. The portfolio is balanced and revenue contributions from all operating segments – Datacenter Client Gaming and Embedded – keep growing.

In the first half the company successfully weathered the slowdown in the PC market by leveraging the strength of its smartphone and commercial notebook segments. The trend is expected to continue given the multiple design wins and high demand for AMD’s new-generation chips among OEMs. The stock looks like a safe bet and the time is ripe to invest in it.

Graphic Power

Meanwhile both Intel and AMD lag behind Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) when it comes to graphic chips. The graphic cards of Nvidia which pioneered the GPU technology are widely used in gaming PCs and cryptocurrency mining systems across the world. Though AMD has made significant progress in tapping into the GPU market it still has a long way to go before catching up with Nvidia. The latter also holds major partnerships with auto manufacturers and mobility service providers to offer advanced processors for self-driving.

The fabless chipmaker has an impressive track record of posting better-than-expected quarterly earnings over the years reflecting the stable revenue growth. It entered fiscal 2023 on a positive note reporting a 46% growth in first-quarter revenues to $8.3 billion and a 50% rise in adjusted earnings to $1.36 per share. However of late elevated operating expenses have put margins under pressure.

NVIDIA Corporation Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript

Though the stock experienced volatility after retreating from last year’s peak it mostly outperformed the market during that period. Analysts overwhelmingly recommend buying NVDA citing its solid growth prospects.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhwY3dpcmUuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMjQvYW1kLXByZXZpZXdzLTQwMC1naWctYWRhcHRpdmUtc21hcnRuaWMtc29jLWF0LWhvdC1jaGlwcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AMD Previews 400 Gig Adaptive SmartNIC SOC at Hot Chips,"Fresh from finalizing its acquisitions of FPGA provider Xilinx (Feb. 2022) and DPU provider Pensando (May 2022) AMD previewed what it calls a 400 Gig Adaptive smartNIC SOC yesterday at Hot Chips. It is another contender in the increasingly crowded and blurry smartNIC/DPU space where distinguishing between the two isn’t always easy.

The motivation for these device types presented by Jaideep Dastidar who joined AMD from Xilinx closely resembles presentations made by Nvidia Intel and others in recent years. Host CPUs are overworked with housekeeping chores (networking storage security tasks). This is complicated by increasing performance and bandwidth demands the disaggregation of resources and rise of software defined everything.

Dastidar said “[The] reason for moving towards smartNICs and DPUs [is] it all started with the movement in the industry towards software defined networking which quickly expanded to software defined storage and before you knew it you had software defined everything. Meanwhile the relentless march of speeds and feeds continue network bandwidths have rapidly increased 25 50 100 200 gig. And the level of virtualization has also expanded ones where you have VMs and the single digits (VMs) has already moved up to the 10s and with containerization you’re dealing with 1000s of virtual entities.

“All of this resulted in a situation where you had an overburdened CPU. So where the CPU instead of running multi-tenant applications was absorbed by running datacenter infrastructure. So to the rescue came smartNICs and DPUs because they help offload those workloads from the host CPU and then the host CPU can go back to focusing on multi-tenant cloud applications.”

This is by now a familiar message. It will be interesting to watch how the market evolves. AMD is promoting its smartNIC as a flexible efficient SOC that leverages fixed logic ASIC technology where appropriate more flexible programmable logic (FPGA) where appropriate and embedded processor cores. AMD of course is positioning itself as a strong provider of all three types of technology (ASIC FPGA and CPU/core).

Like others AMD is also baking advanced security management into its system. Use cases are potentially quite varied spanning network management storage management and security. Support of CXL 2.0 was notable.

“CXL is definitely a nascent technology. In type two devices you can cache host memory as well as have device-attached memory that is accelerated. Right now with the programmable logic we just we wanted to offer the flexibility so that you can either attach the smartNIC as a traditional PCIe endpoint but you can also explore use cases. From a CXL perspective you kind of need a whole bunch of ecosystem support and such so we’re just creating the capability – creating the foundational technology – so that people can go explore the different use cases that may run better as a type two CXL device” said Dastidar.

Using the slide above as a map Dastidar provided a tour of AMD design thinking: “We decided we’re going to take the traditional hardware-software co-design paradigm and extend it to hardware-software-programmable logic co-design. What you see in the figure (slide above) on the right at the top we apply ASIC logic where it does best: crypto offload DMA offload and even full network data plane offload. Then as you go in the clockwise direction we’ve added ASIC-to-programmable logic adapters where you start wanting to layer in customizations such as custom header extensions. Continuing in the clockwise direction you can also completely hot-add or remove new accelerator functions in the programmable logic. Then if you want to tilt the scales all the way we wanted the ability to have the SOC do full custom data plane offload as well.

“Continuing in the clockwise direction. When you have programmable logic agents that need to interact with the embedded processing subsystem we have software-to-programmable logic adapter interfaces such that you can create coherent IO agents interacting with the embedded processor subsystem. Now the embedded processing subsystem has been dimensioned to run the network control plane. If you notice this is the first time we mentioned the control plane. Meanwhile the data plane is being completely executed either in the ASIC logic or the programmable logic or a combination of the two” he said.

Of the telemetry functionality Dastidar said that while the telemetry data is SOC-wide the embedded processing subsystem is the “best place to gather all that telemetry data synthesize it and then upload it to the cloud management plane should they choose to.”

The SOC will be manufactured using TSMC’s 7nm process and be composed of functional blocks. While Dastidar presented a fair amount of material on functionality and supported features he said little about what the needed programming tools would be.

As shown in the slide above AMD has mapped those design ideas into specific subsystems within the adaptive SOC. The host subsystem contains host connectivity and host domain acceleration. The network subsystem that contains the network connectivity and the network domain acceleration. The processing subsystem contains all the embedded processing cores.

Dastidar said “While it’s shown here visually I want you to think about the programmable logic element and the memory subsystem as chip-pervasive resources with chip-pervasive connectivity and access. That connectivity is further enhanced by the programmable network on chip [which] allows for subsystem-to-subsystem data movement and any of the subsystems can access a common memory location should they choose to in terms of the architecture.”

Dastidar also walked through each subsystem. Here’s a snippet of his description of the host subsystem.

“The host connectivity can be a single host PCIe Gen 5 x16 connection to the smartNIC. Alternatively it can go all the way up to a quad host 4x Gen five x4 connection to the smartNIC. In addition the controller supports CXL 2.0 and they can support type one type two or type three CXL devices. Now as I mentioned earlier the PCIe controllers have been upgraded to the latest in PCIe ECN security standards. For example PCIe CMA (component measurement and authentication) PCIe DOE (device object exchange) PCIe IDE (integrity and data encryption) and the controllers also support TDISP which allows trusted VMs to communicate in a confidential compute fashion with the endpoint” said Dastidar.

“The block in the middle is the composable DMA engine. This is a layered data mover. While it can continue to do the traditional offload of host-to-card [and] card-to-host data movement it also can facilitate subsystem-to-subsystem data movement and for the host-to-card data it can steer the data to specific subsystems be it the networking subsystem the programmable logic or the processing subsystem.”

Slides showing the other three subsystems are included at the end of the article.

There’s a lot to digest and unpack still. Dastidar did not say when the product might be launched. It’s worth noting that the new smartNIC is based on Xilinx’s Versal ACAP (adaptive compute acceleration platform) smartNIC architecture. During Q&A Dastidar’s answer to a question about distinguishing AMD’s new smartNIC from Pensando DPUs and Xilinx’s Versal smartNIC was a little hazy.

“[We find] the combination of Xilinx smartNIC technology and Pensando DPU technology complement each other really well. Different customers in the datacenter have different models of engagement. This broad portfolio now that AMD offers gives the customer the choice to engage in any of those models. You know the deployments in the datacenter are not homogenous. There are cases where a customer may find the adaptive SOC-based smartNIC to be particularly attractive for a certain node in the datacenter and the DPU-based smartNIC from Pensando also to be very attractive. One common element we’ve noticed is this very strong focus on customer ease-of-use. From a cultural perspective there’s a very close match both from an adaptive SOC in terms of how the customers will interact with this SOC as well as Pensando. There’s a lot of investment a lot of effort to make sure the customer ease of use is top priority.”

These are still early days in AMD’s incorporation of Xilinx and Pensando and it is perhaps not surprising that product line integration and harmonization are not yet settled. The smartNIC/DPU market is quickly becoming more crowded and will be interesting to watch.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3cyLmFpcC5vcmcvZnlpLzIwMjIvY2hpcHMtYWN0LWZ1bmRpbmctc2V0cy1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLWluaXRpYXRpdmVzLW1vdGlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CHIPS Act Funding Sets Semiconductor Initiatives Into Motion,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3cyLmFpcC5vcmcvZnlpLzIwMjIvY2hpcHMtYWN0LWZ1bmRpbmctc2V0cy1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLWluaXRpYXRpdmVzLW1vdGlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159B9156F80>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3cyLmFpcC5vcmcvZnlpLzIwMjIvY2hpcHMtYWN0LWZ1bmRpbmctc2V0cy1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLWluaXRpYXRpdmVzLW1vdGlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

In more than 700 spots nationwide toxic coal ash is stored in ponds dammed impoundments landfills and more unusual structures: a meteor crater old limestone quarries and the “Ash Island” rising in a lake popular with Tennessee boaters and swimmers.

The vast majority of these coal ash repositories are contaminating groundwater with dangerous pollutants according to monitoring data reported by companies and compiled by environmental groups.

Since federal coal ash rules took effect in 2015 many companies have seemingly flaunted provisions against storing coal ash in contact with groundwater in flood zones or other risky areas.

In January the Environmental Protection Agency announced its intention to actually enforce the coal ash rules. But a months-long investigation by the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University reveals the enormity of the challenge.

The EPA is largely reliant on state regulators and community groups for enforcement and vigilance. But state agencies thus far have largely approved companies’ coal ash management plans with seemingly little scrutiny. And even when state and federal regulators and companies work together to protect human health and the environment there is no easy way to deal with nearly a billion tons of coal ash dumped over the last century not to mention the more than 100 million tons of coal ash still being created each year.

In June E&E News published a leaked list of 160 sites where the EPA is investigating closure plans for unlined pits that could leave ash contaminating groundwater.

“I’ve seen firsthand how coal ash contamination can hurt people and communities. Coal ash surface impoundments and landfills must operate and close in a manner that protects public health and the environment” EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement in January. “For too long communities already disproportionately impacted by high levels of pollution have been burdened by improper coal ash disposal.”

Water at risk

Coal ash is almost always dumped near water bodies — rivers lakes and reservoirs — since it’s historically been held on the sites of coal plants that need water for cooling. Coal ash contaminants can easily leach into groundwater polluting aquifers that serve municipal water systems and private wells. It can also flood or seep into water bodies.

Companies are planning to close the great majority of coal ash impoundments in place despite the fact that most of them are unlined allowing the potential for ongoing groundwater contamination. In January the EPA turned down requests from eight companies seeking an extension on an April 2021 deadline to stop putting coal ash in unlined impoundments. The denials mean those companies — like many others — need to start closing their coal ash pits but how they close remains to be seen. Some of the EPA’s extension denials said companies did not adequately consider removing coal ash from pits and moving it to safer locations but those decisions don’t prohibit the companies from closing ash ponds in place.

Coal ash 101: Everything you need to know about this toxic waste As coal plants close nationwide they leave behind nearly a billion tons of toxic coal ash. The Medill School of Journalism spent months investigating the coal ash threat and how regulators companies and environmental groups are handling it. Here are the basics that will help you understand this looming threat. What is coal ash? Coal ash is the toxic byproduct of burning coal to generate electricity. It contains heavy metals that can contaminate groundwater lakes and rivers. Where is coal ash located? Coal ash is stored in more than 700 ponds and landfills nationwide most of them unlined. Ash can also be recycled — known as “beneficial reuse” — in which it is used to make concrete or build roads. What is the Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) Rule? In 2015 the EPA established rules for coal ash units requiring companies to test groundwater remediate contamination and make plans to close the units. Companies have to post groundwater monitoring data and closure plans online. The rule excludes hundreds of “legacy ash ponds” that closed before the federal rule took effect in 2015 yet these ponds are still causing serious groundwater contamination. The rule also does not cover coal ash that was over decades dumped and scattered around coal plant sites and even surrounding areas often used to build up berms or fill in land. Is coal ash contaminating our water? Data posted by companies shows that contaminants around coal ash ponds frequently exceed limits set by the EPA sometimes exponentially. Private wells used for drinking water can be and have been contaminated by coal ash. Rivers and lakes used for recreation and municipal water supplies can also be contaminated by coal ash. What’s in coal ash? Boron Boron is linked to reproductive problems like low birth weight and is also toxic to aquatic life. Lead Lead is a potent neurotoxin linked to swelling of the brain and nervous system damage. Lithium Lithium is linked to liver and kidney damage as well as neurological diseases and birth defects. Arsenic Arsenic is linked to nervous system damage and higher rates of cancer. Molybdenum Molybdenum is linked to gout high blood pressure and liver diseases. Cobalt Cobalt is linked to thyroid damage and blood diseases. How is a coal ash pond closed? Coal ash sites need to close after getting their final shipment of coal ash if they are polluting groundwater above certain standards or if they fail to meet other safety criteria. The rules say all unlined ponds needed to stop accepting waste by April 2021 though some requested exceptions and have continued filling with coal ash. Cap-in-place closure A protective cover is placed over the coal ash so rainwater doesn’t get in and cause flooding or increased leaching into groundwater. If the coal ash is left in contact with groundwater or permeable rock it can continue leaching contaminants even when capped. Removal closure Coal ash is excavated from a pond dried and moved to a lined landfill above the water table. Companies may be able to build a landfill on the power plant site. Shipping coal ash to landfills off-site means heavy truck traffic or shipping by barge or rail. Who pays for coal ash cleanup? Companies The owners of coal ash sites — utilities or power companies and their shareholders — can pay the cost of coal ash cleanup often hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars across multiple sites. Ratepayers Utilities can seek approval from state public service commissions to bill the cost of coal ash cleanup to ratepayers. They can even seek a profit as a portion of the costs. Government If coal ash is designated a Superfund site the EPA can make the responsible parties — utility or power companies — pay for the cleanup. The government can also pay for the cleanup from a pool of Superfund money especially if the companies no longer exist or can’t pay. Compiled by Sruthi Gopalakrishnan.

The EPA recently released a list of more than 300 coal ash units “potentially with waste below the water table.” The federal rules prohibit closing a coal ash impoundment with ash within 5 feet of groundwater but many sites have proposed to do just that — including Greenidge Generation a Bitcoin-mining operation in the Finger Lakes; Lincoln Stone Quarry near Joliet Illinois; Clifty Creek in Southern Indiana; and multiple Tennessee Valley Authority and Georgia Power sites.

“We’ve seen substantial noncompliance” with the federal rules said Earthjustice attorney Lisa Evans. “We haven’t yet seen EPA or a state agency bring an enforcement action to stop these illegal closures. In fact we’ve seen the opposite — we’ve seen Georgia and Alabama giving utilities permits to close a [coal ash] unit with ash in contact with groundwater which is a violation of the federal rule.”

A Medill analysis of U.S. Geological Survey data showed high concentrations of private wells around unlined coal ash impoundments particularly in the rural South and Midwest. Municipal water systems also draw water from aquifers near coal ash as seen in USGS data including in multiple sites in Missouri Illinois and Wisconsin.

There is typically no government oversight of private wells hence it is usually up to citizens to pay to test their own water except in cases where specific concerns have spurred local governments or utilities to test wells.

When environmental groups or local governments have done spot testing of wells because of coal ash concerns contamination has been found — for example near Lincoln Stone Quarry; the Possum Point power plant in Prince William County Virginia; and the Michigan City power plant in Northwest Indiana. A report by Earthjustice found evidence of well contamination linked to coal ash at 24 sites including in Wisconsin North Carolina Pennsylvania and Illinois. Since countless people living near coal ash never test their wells or understand possible risks much contamination could be going unseen.

Meanwhile a number of sites risk spilling coal ash into nearby rivers and lakes through erosion or impoundment failure. That’s what happened when an impoundment near the Tennessee Valley Authority’s Kingston plant collapsed just before Christmas in 2008 inundating rivers and homes with more than a billion gallons of coal ash. The disaster which caused multiple deaths sparked the coal ash regulation process.

More than 200 coal ash enclosures nationwide are designated as significant or high hazard according to company data meaning impoundment failure would likely cause human death or significant environmental and economic damage. More than 30 impoundments with a high hazard rating — meaning possible fatalities in case of failure — are slated to close in place. Companies generally report their impoundments meet structural safety criteria during regular inspections according to Medill’s analysis and environmental experts say companies and regulators have been more vigilant regarding structural safety since the Kingston disaster. Still the continued existence of high- and significant-risk impoundments — including many along the Ohio River — raises concerns.

“At a number of places these berms and the dikes themselves are actually built on top of or out of coal ash” noted Earthjustice attorney Jenny Cassel. “And that ash easily destabilizes.” Under enough pressure and water dikes made of coal ash can go through “liquefaction” Cassel noted: “It sort of turns into water and doesn’t hold anymore.”

Flooding can also carry coal ash across land and into water bodies; 172 coal ash units are located in 100-year flood zones or regulatory floodways according to companies’ data. The majority of them are slated to close in place. Floods and heavy rains are only expected to increase with climate change with 100-year floods already happening more frequently.

“One of the worst waste disposal scenarios you can imagine is to leave [coal ash] in the floodplain in contact with groundwater” said Indra Frank health and water policy director for the Hoosier Environmental Council. “And that’s what Indiana has right now; we’ve got a lot of that.”

Thom Cmar an Ohio-based attorney for Earthjustice noted that flooding not only can spread ash outside ponds but also increases groundwater contamination.

“People tend to focus a lot on the possibility for the sort of worst-case scenario of disaster but the bigger problem is what’s happening not necessarily on a day-to-day basis but every time there’s a major rainstorm” Cmar said. “The river levels rise so that ashes can be saturated with water. And that creates a steady ongoing source of pollution that will have an effect on the river that runs right next to it and the groundwater beneath it for decades into the future.”

Ash has even been allowed to remain in areas plagued by sinkholes like the Tennessee Valley Authority site near Muscle Shoals Alabama where sinkholes in the past caused coal ash to drain rapidly out of ponds multiple times. At Georgia Power’s Plant Bowen the company is planning to add a liner to a coal ash pond but leave it in the same spot where in 2002 a four-acre sinkhole opened and released coal ash into a nearby creek.

Solutions and more problems

Environmental experts generally argue that the best way to deal with coal ash is to excavate it from ponds dry it and store it in a lined landfill.

“When ash is in groundwater near waterways excavation is the only way to eliminate the source of pollution and store the ash safely for the long run” said Frank Holleman senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center which has filed lawsuits forcing companies to remove ash from ponds. “If you put ash in the ground next to a water body which is where these places are it’s going to be in contact with groundwater. If ash is sitting in groundwater near a river or lake it’s inherently a dangerous situation.”

In South Carolina North Carolina and Virginia state laws and legal settlements mean that nearly all coal ash must be excavated from unlined or improperly lined impoundments and put in modern lined landfills. The utilities Duke Energy Dominion Energy and Santee Cooper will have to remove ash from more than 30 units spread over at least 17 plant sites based on analyses of company data. Duke is slated to excavate more than 120 million tons of coal ash in North Carolina and South Carolina by 2035. About 35 million tons have already been excavated in those states according to Duke.

Advocates say this shows full removal of coal ash is possible and companies that have said they can’t remove ash should try harder.

“Now that they’ve created this problem they’re saying it will be too hard for us to clean up the mess we made” Holleman said. Duke’s excavation “disproves that argument.”

But even this best-practice solution raises problems. Coal ash is often moved to existing landfills many miles away often across state lines. This means transporting it by rail barge or truck — which comes with its own environmental and health impacts. Companies seem to most often propose moving coal ash by trucks predicting it will take years for hundreds of trucks a day to clear an impoundment. As coal plants are disproportionately located in lower-income and minority areas this means these communities suffer from diesel emissions and dangerous traffic.

Landfills likewise are disproportionately located in low-income and minority areas where residents are angry their communities have become the final resting place for coal ash. For example when the Tennessee Valley Authority decided where to move ash from its massive Allen Fossil Plant in Memphis it considered seven landfills that were nearly all in minority areas. It ultimately decided to truck the ash to a nearby landfill in a majority Black neighborhood of Memphis despite residents’ strident opposition. After TVA’s 2008 disaster the ash from the cleanup was trucked from the predominantly White city of Kingston to a landfill in Uniontown an impoverished Black community in Alabama.

Coal ash “was brought in against our will” said Uniontown resident Carlene James. “By the time the people knew about it it was a done deal.”

Coal ash from the massive AES power plant in Puerto Rico has likewise created problems when the company acquiesced to local demands to move it.

When AES dumped the ash in the Dominican Republic residents reported spikes in cancer and birth defects and the Dominican government banned its import. Now AES’ coal ash is being sent by barge to a private port in Jacksonville Florida then trucked to a landfill in Georgia despite the outrage of local officials. Last year a barge carrying coal ash from Puerto Rico to Jacksonville ran aground on a sandbar and spilled its cargo into the ocean a harbinger of the environmental and economic risks of such transport as local leaders see it.

Experts often argue that companies should build a new landfill on their power plant site to avoid transporting coal ash. But even this solution can raise concerns as in Possum Point Virginia where Dominion’s plan to store coal ash in a new on-site landfill has infuriated neighbors who say they’ve dealt with the coal plant’s pollution for too long. Possum Point shows that wealthier residents can also see the impacts of coal ash — the landfill will be right near a new development of homes costing up to $1 million.

Another challenge of more rigorous coal ash cleanups: Ratepayers often pick up the tab. In most states electric utilities are able to bill ratepayers for the investments they make in power generation and environmental remediation while earning an extra profit in the process. State utility regulators around the country have been debating how much utilities can charge ratepayers for coal ash cleanup and how much profit they can bake into the equation.

South Carolina regulators decided and the state Supreme Court agreed last year that Duke couldn’t bill South Carolina customers for cleaning up coal ash in North Carolina. In North Carolina state regulators also last year negotiated with Duke to ultimately reduce the coal ash tab it planned to place on ratepayers by $1.1 billion.

But more often companies are able to recoup their costs plus a profit and the costs to individual households can be significant. In Georgia ratepayers are expected to pay for Georgia Power’s coal ash cleanup estimated at $9 billion — around $4000 per household over 60 years.

Georgia Power had previously planned to close the majority of its ponds in place according to environmental groups’ analysis of company plans submitted under the federal rules. But the EPA has indicated it may require more rigorous cleanup including more coal ash removal which could better protect water but cause costs to climb. Georgia Power spokesman John Kraft said that currently the company is in the process of removing ash from 20 ponds while closing nine in place.

Legacy ash loophole

The federal rules don’t currently cover coal ash impoundments that stopped accepting ash before 2015. In a notice of intent to sue sent to the EPA and Department of Justice in May national environmental groups and community organizations in Illinois Indiana and Tennessee said they’ve identified at least 140 coal ash impoundments not covered by the rules which they say are even more likely than the regulated impoundments to be contaminating groundwater.

In 2018 — in response to a citizen lawsuit — a federal appeals court ordered the EPA to add such legacy coal ash impoundments to the federal rules. In its ruling the court likened the EPA’s decision not to regulate legacy ash ponds to a kindergarten teacher only requiring students to clean up a drink they had just spilled while allowing a drink spilt in the past to remain on the floor. “A student who refused to clean up that completed spill (as Industry Petitioners would have it) might well find himself on time out” the opinion said.

While environmental groups cheered the decision Earthjustice and other groups allege in their recent filing that almost four years later seemingly little progress has been made on regulating legacy ash.

In addition to legacy ash ponds not yet covered by the 2015 rules “scattered historic” ash also poses a major problem environmental groups say.

In decades past coal ash was distributed liberally across coal plant sites and nearby areas often used as structural fill to build up land or create berms. Such historic ash presents a particular challenge as there are few records about where exactly it was deposited. Environmental groups have pieced together details through historic photos and documents.

“Before there were any regulations whatsoever for this stuff they just kind of dumped it anywhere” Cassel said. “Near the coal plants particularly next to the rivers they would just find depressions in the ground or dig them and throw coal ash in.”

At NIPSCO’s Michigan City power plant for example advocates are demanding that the utility address coal ash that was mixed with sand and soil in land butting up against Lake Michigan held back only by corroding steel walls. The company has said the coal ash is in low enough concentrations that it does not pose a risk but Hoosier Environmental Council attorney Indra Frank disagrees.

“They needed to dispose of coal ash for several decades and they had this area that they had walled off that they were busy filling in” she said. “That was by far the least expensive disposal method they had.”

At We Energies’ Oak Creek plant in Wisconsin historic coal ash cascaded into Lake Michigan when a bluff collapsed in 2011. The coal ash had decades ago been used to fill a ravine.

Coal ash not covered by the federal rules can also impede cleanups that are covered by the rules if it influences the way groundwater monitoring results are interpreted. Under the rules companies are required to install “upgradient” and “downgradient” monitoring wells. Contamination in wells downgradient of coal ash ponds covered by the rules is compared to the upgradient wells. If contamination is as high or higher in upgradient wells it’s generally assumed that contamination did not come from the coal ash ponds but from other sources. However historic ash on the site can pollute upgradient wells essentially letting companies off the hook since they can argue contamination is from a source other than the coal ash ponds covered by the rules.

At the Clifty Creek plant on the Ohio River for example Indiana-Kentucky Electric Corporation filings acknowledge that contamination likely comes from historic coal ash dumped since the plant opened in the 1950s. But the corporation doesn’t plan to remediate contamination since it is not from ponds covered by the rules. A similar situation has played out at the Four Corners coal plant on the Navajo Nation according to the environmental groups’ notice of intent to sue.

Silver linings

Coal plants are closing at a rapid clip nationwide as coal-fired power becomes increasingly more expensive than power from renewables and natural gas (excepting the natural gas price spike driven by the Ukraine war). That means job and tax base losses for communities home to those plants. But rigorous cleanup of coal ash can provide jobs to help ease the transition away from coal advocates point out.

In Colstrip Montana where a large plant near the Northern Cheyenne reservation is likely to close in coming years robust coal ash cleanup could create about 400 jobs annually for a decade according to an analysis by the Northern Plains Resource Council. The nearby Northern Cheyenne tribe where unemployment is high could benefit from those jobs though many tribal members remain suspicious of what they call the coal company’s history of broken promises.

The pollution burden of coal ash can also be lessened by increased recycling or “beneficial use.” Coal ash is a crucial ingredient in making concrete and it is also used in building roads and other structures while the coal-burning byproduct gypsum is used in drywall. When done correctly such use is safe according to industry and advocates alike. Environmental advocates and state regulators often call for increased recycling of coal ash to reduce the amount that must be stored and meet market demands.

Even as the U.S. deals with countless tons of unwanted coal ash certain types of coal ash are being imported from abroad to serve industry. With more investment and careful handling more coal ash could be reused and coal ash currently stored in landfills or impoundments could be funneled into reuse experts note. Coal and construction industry sources lobbied hard during the rule-making to ensure coal ash was not designated a hazardous waste which would have impeded reuse.

“They wanted coal ash to be listed as non-hazardous material so they could use it for recycling. … And yet why aren’t we doing it more often?” asked Dean Naujoks the Potomac Riverkeeper representing the Riverkeeper organization in Virginia and surrounding areas.

Attorneys and advocates who have led the fight for better regulation and enforcement say they are hopeful that the EPA’s recent emphasis on coal ash rules will lead to real change.

“As we move on from coal and transition to clean energy” said Earthjustice attorney Lisa Evans “we’ve got to make sure that these sites are left clean and healthy for the communities that have been burdened with this pollution for so many decades already.”

Latest rivalry in college football pits Aflac Duck against new nemesis Gap Goat representing the gap ...,"COLUMBUS Ga. Aug. 24 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Aflac  a leading provider of supplemental health insurance in the U.S.1 is kicking off its marketing campaign for the 2022-2023 college football season to shine a light on the gap between health insurance and medical bills. This season Aflac is introducing a new character Gap Goat who serves as a nemesis to America's favorite spokesduck in a series of humorous commercials airing throughout the season.

The Aflac Duck represents a solution to help American consumers who are concerned about their health care and finances. Post this Aflac is introducing a new character Gap Goat who serves as a nemesis to America’s favorite spokesduck in a series of humorous commercials airing throughout the season.

Deion ""Coach Prime"" Sanders and Coach Nick Saban return as part of the Aflac Duck vs. Gap Goat campaign which also features a new original and recurring character starring opposite the Aflac Duck. Throughout the campaign the Gap Goat serves as an antagonist who shows up with unexpected medical bills for hardworking Americans at inopportune times all the while bleating out the catch phrase ""GAAAAP!"" The goat represents the gap that can be left when health insurance doesn't cover all of one's medical expenses.

""While the Aflac Duck remains a household name the Gap Goat presents new marketing opportunities to build a story that leverages both humor and purpose to help educate fans on the gaps for those facing medical debt"" said Aflac U.S. President Teresa White.

The Aflac Duck who opposes the Gap Goat in these spots represents a solution to help American consumers who are concerned about their health care and finances — Aflac — by showing them how to help close the gap between what health insurance covers and what is left behind. Coach Prime and Coach Saban serve as translators for the Aflac Duck and Gap Goat.

""Last year I had an unexpected medical event and while I am fortunate enough to have the means to pay the onslaught of medical bills many are not afforded the same peace of mind and are often tackled by the cost of care"" said Coach Prime. ""That makes being a part of this year's campaign especially meaningful for me as I continue to work with Aflac to ensure that fans are better prepared to help close the gap between where insurance ends and medical debt starts.""

""For the last three years I've had the opportunity to work with Aflac and advocate for those facing medical debt"" said Coach Saban. ""In football we run into unexpected situations in games each week but only through preparation are we able to overcome the challenges. It's the same thing in life which is why I work with Aflac to help fans better prepare for unexpected health expenses they may encounter.""

The Aflac Duck vs. Gap Goat campaign will run across television digital social and audio platforms. The first spot ""The Arrival"" makes its debut Aug. 27 on ESPN during the opening weekend of the college football season. The second spot ""Stadium Worker"" will land Oct. 15 and the third spot ""Treadmill Race"" will air Oct. 29.

Aflac will be extending the campaign across different marketing efforts through social media digital and on-site experiential activations at high-profile games including HBCU mainstays like the Celebration Bowl. Fans can also get to know Aflac at Aflac.com.

More than a month later we get a first look at the coaches - along with the Aflac Duck - in their newest commercial.

The difference this year however is they brought a friend.

The trio is kicking off the new college football season with a marketing campaign titled “Aflac Duck vs Gap Goat” to introduce Aflac’s new character the Gap Goat.

In this campaign the Gap Goat symbolizing the imbalance left when health insurance doesn’t cover all of one’s medical expenses rivals the Aflac Duck which of course is a solution to this problem.

“For the last three years I’ve had the opportunity to work with Aflac and advocate for those facing medical debt” Saban said in a release. “In football we run into unexpected situations in games each week but only through preparation are we able to overcome the challenges. It’s the same thing in life which is why I work with Aflac to help fans better prepare for unexpected health expenses they may encounter.”

Expect throughout the season watching Saban and “Coach Prime” acting alongside these personalities in a series of commercials to help fans understand that Aflac will tackle the gap caused by expenses not covered by medical insurance.

“Last year I had an unexpected medical event and while I am fortunate enough to have the means to pay the onslaught of medical bills many are not afforded the same peace of mind and are often tackled by the cost of care” Sanders said in a release. “That makes being a part of this year’s campaign especially meaningful for me as I continue to work with Aflac to ensure that fans are better prepared to help close the gap between where insurance ends and medical debt starts.”

The first spot titled “The Arrival” airs on Aug. 27 on ESPN during Week 0 games.

This college football season Aflac’s unforgettable spokesduck encounters a new nemesis – the ‘Gap Goat’ – and all the medical debt he represents.

The supplemental health insurance provider Aflac will air a trio of slapstick-rich spots that introduce the Gap Goat and the gap between health insurance and medical bills.

In the campaign’s first spot ‘The Arrival’ the Aflac Duck joins The University of Alabama’s head coach Nick Saban for a game of chess when their game is interrupted by the never-before-seen Gap Goat.

The two animals promptly enter a screaming match as the goat bleats “Gap” and the duck quacks “Aflac“. Once Nick Saban and Jackson State’s coach Deion Sanders decode the altercation we learn that the Gap Goat is the Aflac Duck’s ultimate foil character: he embodies the unexpected medical bills that health insurance fails to cover.

“While the Aflac Duck remains a household name the Gap Goat presents new marketing opportunities to build a story that leverages both humor and purpose to help educate fans on the gaps for those facing medical debt” said Aflac US president Teresa White in a statement.

Both coaches have worked on past campaigns with Aflac. “Nick Saban and Deion ‘Coach Prime’ Sanders are considered two of the greatest of all time at what they do” said Garth Knutson vice-president of brand at Aflac. “Going into our fourth season with Coach Saban and second season with Coach Prime we saw an opportunity to turn the ‘goat’ moniker into a new personality to educate fans on the gap that can exist with their insurance.

“We always look for ways to interject humor into our campaigns and believe that fans will enjoy the dynamic between the Aflac Duck and Gap Goat who will help us educate them on how Aflac can help them be better prepared for unexpected medical expenses.”

Earlier Wednesday Jackson State’s Coach Prime and the Alabama coach debuted their latest Aflac commercial - along with the Duck. In fact they added an additional member to the Aflac team.

The two coaches then appeared together on ESPN’s “SportsCenter” where Saban’s new $93.6 million contract - which will keep him on the sidelines in Tuscaloosa until he is 79 - was a main topic of discussion.

The Alabama coach released a statement Tuesday but Wednesday pointed out he’ll know when it is time to retire. He just doesn’t know it yet.

“I’m gonna do it for as long as I’m not an impediment to this program” Saban said. “I don’t want to ride program down so I’m excited about the future.”

Meanwhile Sanders couldn’t be more complimentary of the Crimson Tide’s coach.

“I just want everything after the comma” Sanders joked a reference to the $93100000 contract.

“Coach Saban is our magna cum laude (of coaching)” Sanders added. “He is our guy. You would not have questioned Michael Jordan and you don’t question LeBron (James) when they are given a contract of this status. We should never question him. I love what he is doing. I love the bar he has set.

“Every opportunity I get to sit with him on this wonderful Aflac set I’m gleaning from him just some of the fruit and nuggets he’s able to spit to me. I’m thankful. I’m happy. Well deserved. No one I wish I wouldn’t catch anyone saying anything about the contract coach Saban has warranted. He is the GOAT.”

Patrick Batoon Product Manager of Triple Quadrupole LC/MS Agilent Technologies Mass Spectrometry Division



Although we’re unable to make self-operating mass spectrometers yet we can intelligently automate difficult and challenging tasks making mass spec more accessible. The new Agilent 6475 triple quadrupole LC/MS with MassHunter 12 brings about exciting new changes to targeted LC/MS instrumentation by adding easy-to-use yet sophisticated onboard intelligence for routine analysis. This presentation will cover the new intelligence features and how they improve analytical performance and lab productivity and provide peace of mind for day-to-day operation.



11:00am-11:30am: Combining an Optical Microscope with a High-End Mass Spectrometer for a Seamless Imaging Experimental Workflow

Nazim Boutaghou PhD Product Manager Life Science Shimadzu Scientific Instruments



Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is arguably the most challenging application in mass spectrometry. The demands of the application require instrument manufacturers to design instruments that push physics limits while keeping the instruments easy to use and rugged. Users in the field are also challenged by their goals and sample preparation that requires attention at every step. Shimadzu Corporation has recently launched a new Imaging Mass Microscope that incorporates two key instruments for imaging experiments: a high-end microscope and an ultra-fast Q-TOF mass spectrometer. The result is a unique workflow and user experience that enables scientists to obtain accurate images in no time. In this presentation we will discuss the basics of an imaging experiment its limitations and how Shimadzu’s comprehensive imaging platform can help new and existing MSI users overcome those limitations.



11:30am-12:00pm: Rapid and Complete Reduction of All Disulfide Bonds in mAbs Using On-line Electrochemistry–MS

Jean-Pierre Chervet CEO Antec Scientific



The rapid electrochemical reduction of both intra- and interchain disulfide bonds in different mAbs will be presented using electrochemical reduction inline with a high-resolution accurate mass liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (HRAM LC–MS) system. At a potential of 1 V at 60 °C complete reduction is achieved without modification of the LC–MS method other than the introduction of the electrochemical cell and the trap/release switching step. The developed workflow reduces an antibody down to light and heavy chain subunits without the need for enzymes or denaturing or reducing agents. Furthermore the selectivity of the electrochemical S-S bond reduction by tandem MS could provide information about non-uniform disulfide bonding structures within mAbs.

It’s also an industry where innovation abounds. Take for instance ILC Dover which designed and manufactured a protective hood for health care workers within months after COVID hit. Its other products range all the way from spacesuits to flood-control barriers.

Or W.L. Gore & Associates which is best known as the inventor of GORE-TEX but continues to innovate with new solutions such as high-performance aerospace wires that could improve the fuel efficiency of air travel.

Or Agilent Technologies which has positioned itself as a leader in life sciences diagnostics and applied chemicals. One of its most recent innovations: testing cannabis products for metal contamination.

Then there’s Miller Metal Fabrication a long-established family business that uses LEAN manufacturing techniques to eliminate waste from the manufacturing process for the wide range of metal products it makes on behalf of clients such as Volvo Vulcan and the Department of Defense.

But not all of Delaware’s manufacturers run the kinds of factory floors most people picture when they think “manufacturing.” In fact Delaware excels as a home to smaller manufacturers. There are 525 manufacturing firms in the First State with fewer than 100 employees or about 91% of all manufacturers according to data from the Census County Business Patterns compiled in 2021. About 7600 people work at these micro-manufacturers.

With the recent disruptions in the global supply chain Delaware’s manufacturing sector is poised to grow further given Delaware’s central location for shipping along the East Coast and to the Midwest. Meanwhile those manufacturers who are already here are working to find ways to make their entire process from discovery to production to distribution more efficient. For some such as Haberson-based JennyGems that’s meant expanding in Delaware to make more components closer to home. For Bear-based AWSM Solutions it’s meant pivoting from a business model that’s heavily based in logistics to one that embraces in-house manufacturing.

The state has encouraged growth in this sector by means of its Encouraging Development Growth and Expansion (EDGE) Grant program. One recipient Wilmington-based CM Materials is among the vanguard of new exciting manufacturing companies in the state — as is Superbrewed Food which makes a protein that has the potential to help solve global food-supply issues. The company’s process also yields a byproduct with a truly endless laundry list of potential applications ranging from animal health to automotive coatings.

In the logistics sector companies like Trinity Logistics help hundreds of clients ship around the country and the world even in the face of massive disruptions while the Port of Wilmington remains a gateway to Delaware and for companies eager to spread their wares beyond the state’s shores. A massive new Amazon warehouse has made Delaware a key spoke in that company’s distribution system.

It all adds up to an innovative future.

Superbrewed Food: Making a Better Protein Bryan Tracy likes to say that Henry Ford didn’t invent a mechanical horse — he invented a car. Similarly Tracy’s company Superbrewed Food makes a protein that doesn’t try to mimic existing proteins. As he puts it “Why make whey protein when I can beat whey protein?”

So like all the best innovators Newark-based Superbrewed Food exists to solve a problem in a new way. In this case the problem is global in scale: how to feed people in a way that’s sustainable nutritious affordable and equitable?

Tracy’s answer is the Superbrewed Cultured Protein a versatile ingredient produced by means of an anaerobic fermentation process — think the same kind of process that turns cabbage into kimchi. In addition to protein the product is a significant source of essential vitamins and minerals including B-12 which is essential to human survival but is found mostly in meat products. From a nutritional perspective that makes Superbrewed Food’s protein superior to plant-based meat and dairy alternatives Tracy says.

Tracy also emphasizes that Superbrewed Food’s manufacturing process doesn’t use any genetically modified organisms. In fact the fermentation that results in Superbrewed Cultured Protein is conducted using microorganisms that live naturally in the human digestive tract. “They’re already playing a critical role in converting the foods we eat into the nutrients we need” Tracy says. Another bonus: unlike plant-based meat and dairy alternatives Superbrewed Cultured Protein doesn’t contain any known allergens.



“We’re working with several of the largest consumer brands in the alternative dairy space. You’ll see us in the consumer market in the coming years for sure.”

While you won’t be able to find foods made with Superbrewed Cultured Protein on store shelves just yet the potential applications are numerous. Tracy envisions the protein being used to produce dairy and meat alternatives but also nutrition bars tortillas and a whole range of other food products. “We’re working with several of the largest consumer brands in the alternative dairy space” he says.“You’ll see us in the consumer market in the coming years for sure.”

As for scaling Superbrewed Food uses existing infrastructure that’s setup globally for fermentation such as its current production facility in Minnesota.

“That provides us with a pathway to ramp up the scale of production quickly while keeping the cost low” Tracy says. “To have a real impact on equitable access to food you have to have scale.”

In the spirit of being sustainable Superbrewed Food also makes use of the byproduct of its fermentation process: butyrate. Last summer the company announced a partnership with Acme-Hardesty to distribute its butyrate in the form of a nutritional supplement. Butyrate can supplement the diets of both humans and animals and it also has countless other applications. “It goes into composite materials it goes into replacing oil-based products with more cost-effective alternatives it goes into things such as automotive coatings” Tracy says. “We’re addressing multiple industries simultaneously and maximizing efficiencies.”

And he notes Superbrewed Food is poised to do it all in Delaware. “Delaware is in our DNA and in our heart” he says. “We’re utilizing the native ecosystem of brain trust and talent and the wherewithal of the multi-billion-dollar companies that are headquartered here or have a significant presence. We have such capability here and we tap into that knowledge all the time.”

CM Materials: Creating Better Greener Power Sources When Aminul Mehidi founder and CEO of Wilmington-based CM (Clean Magnet) Materials was working to develop the material that would eventually lead to a product that can make batteries run more efficiently he was extremely careful. Mehidi knew he had a breakthrough concept and he didn’t want anybody else to figure out how it worked.

So he spent three-plus years engaging several foundries and labs around the country in the development of part of his idea giving each a bit of the work necessary to create the final product. That way no one spot had enough information to put it all together.

“This material has a very high electric resistivity. It provides better magnetic efficiency. It also allows companies to make smaller devices that run more efficiently.”

The result of all that hard work is a powder that has two patents pending and will allow companies that make power components to make them smaller and more effective. CM Materials which Mehidi started in 2021 with $400000 of seed investment and which is located in The Innovation Space in Wilmington has the potential to improve the efficacy of power sources for a variety of applications — and to do it in a greener way. Those power sources include motors generators transformers power converters and sensors. “This material has a very high electric resistivity” Mehidi says. “It provides better magnetic efficiency. It also allows companies to make smaller devices that run more efficiently.”

Mehidi was born in Bangladesh and completed his undergraduate studies there. In 2012 he came to the U.S. to complete master’s and doctorate degrees at the University of Minnesota where heal so co-founded his first company Minnealloy Magnetics which produced a soft magnetic material that he co-developed for use in power converters motors and sensors.

After the company licensed the material to another firm Mehidi worked for Tesla and then Philadelphia-based Carpenter Technology Corporation. He began his journey with CM Materials in 2017 and in January of this year the company received a $100000 EDGE Grant from the state of Delaware. Mehidi is excited about CM Materials’ potential for future sales but he is also extremely proud that it can help produce cleaner energy.

“This material is made from sustain-able sources” he says. “Because it can make devices smaller it will reduce carbon dioxide emissions. I’m from Bangladesh and that country is affected heavily by those emissions.”

Thanks to Mehidi that could change.

Agilent Technologies: Investing in Digital Capabilities Agilent Technologies is best known for creating solutions that serve its clients in the pharmaceutical forensics and energy industries. For instance Agilent devices test “70% of the world’s water for impurities” says Steve Cohan the company’s vice president for customer service.

Recently Agilent has also carved out a space for itself in the growing cannabis and hemp sector. Its ICP-MS Cannabis Analyzer bundled with a proprietary analysis process has been approved by the AOAC formerly known as the Association of Official Agricultural Chemists. It is the first heavy metals testing method for cannabis products to receive that seal of approval.

However when asked to name one of Agilent’s most significant recent innovations Cohan emphasizes internal changes made during the COVID pandemic.

“What we have done is invested in digital capabilities to help customers” says Cohan. “COVID accelerated our ability to help customers solve issues without being on site.”



“Customers can log into an app and reach a remote tech person. They can show the problem which the tech support person will annotate on a tablet. The customer can get input put the phone down work on the problem and then go back for more advice and help.”

The investment growth and ability to connect with customers despite the challenges of the pandemic has paid off handsomely for Agilent. In late February of this year The Wall Street Journal ranked Agilent second among its Management Top 250 for customer satisfaction. Agilent’s score was 77.1 just a bit behind Cisco (77.7).

This was something that has been in the works for a while. Prior to 2020 Agilent began the pilot program for CrossLab Virtual Assist an integrated approach to creating solutions for those working with Agilent products and technologies. “It’s like FaceTime on steroids” Cohan says. “Customers can log into an app and reach a remote tech person. They can show the problem which the tech support person will annotate on a tablet. The customer can get input put the phone down work on the problem and then go back for more advice and help.”

According to Cohan the company —which has a presence in Wilmington that employs 1000 people — answers 7000calls a day worldwide and makes 2500on-site visits to work with customers.

The future has plenty of possibilities for Agilent but much of it is dependent on how well the company continues to develop its digital capabilities for distribution support and solutions.

“I call them triple plays” Cohan says. “When we invest in digital capabilities we improve the employee experience we improve the customer experience and we improve financially. It’s all three benefits at once.”

AWSM Solution: Pivoting to Local Growth If anybody wonders why Bear-based AWSM Solutions will be opening a 34000-square-foot facility in July they should think about logistics not just a business expansion.

In previous years the company received a substantial portion of the supplies it needs to make its products — which are distributed to companies that produce cleaning materials pharmaceutical products and paper — from overseas. The timeline was reasonable and allowed for success.

Last year that changed.

“We did 11 full planes filled with chemicals that we were transporting due to logistical issues instead of shipping by sea” says John Logue CEO of AWSM which is pronounced “Awesome.” “It was much more expensive.”

In the past a shipment from Shanghai where AWSM has relationships with suppliers used to take 25 days. Now it takes 50. So the company is trying to figure out ways to tighten the timeframes and find out what materials are available so that it can produce as much as it’s able.

“In manufacturing now you’re not making what you want to make” Logue says. “You’re making what you can make.”

AWSM was formed in September 2020 as part of Royale Pigments and Chemicals a company founded by Logue’s father that moved recently from New Jersey to Delaware. It employs 30 people and plans to expand starting in July when the next facility opens.

Because the larger facility is set up for larger-scale work Logue expects AWSM to become more of a manufacturer rather than a company that takes others’ materials and blends them together for distribution. “We have a bigger space so we can do serious manufacturing” Logue says.

“We can make chemicals instead of just mixing chemicals together.”

That doesn’t mean AWSM will be irresponsible as it grows. Logue reports the company has a large emphasis on environmental health and safety. And though the company will continue to work with companies in Asia particularly China and India where it has strong relationships Logue recognizes that “geopolitical and logistical issues” have forced AWSM to look at doing more work with U.S. partners as well as increasing what it is able to manufacture.

“We have been waiting for a piece of equipment for six months and we were told we would have it in eight weeks” he says. “I can hire six or seven people when I get this part.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNDE3LTAyMi0wMDUyMi130gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Creation of Philadelphia chromosome by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated double cleavages on BCR and ABL1 genes as a ...,"Chromosomal translocation is generated by aberrant ligation of two simultaneous DSBs [43]. Interestingly simultaneous DSBs on different chromosomes are reported to be sufficient to promote reciprocal translocations in mouse embryonic stem cell system [44]. When a genome editing system became available to induce a DSB of human genome at any locus of interest EWSR::FLI1 and NPM1::ALK which are oncogenic fusions in Ewing sarcoma and anaplastic large cell lymphoma respectively were artificially generated in human mesenchymal precursors using zinc finger and transcription activator-like effector nucleases [45]. Subsequently EWSR::FLI1 and NPM1::ALK were generated by simultaneous cleavages at the target sites with the CRISPR/Cas9 system [46474849]. Similarly leukemogenic MLL fusion genes including MLL::AF4 [505152] MLL::AF9 [50 535455] and MLL::ENL [56] were generated by double cleavages using CRISPR/Cas9 in human hematopoietic cells and in the murine 32D myeloid progenitor cell line. For the development of incorrect ligation to take place between two DSBs each DSB is supposed to be proximally located in the nucleus. Here we note that the intergenic distance between BCR and ABL1 genes in hematopoietic cells was reported to be less than expected [57 58]. We hypothesized that simultaneous DSBs at two specific breakpoints of the BCR and ABL1 genes by the CRISPR/Cas9 system may artificially generate a BCR::ABL1 fusion gene in human cells as a result of balanced translocation. To test this hypothesis we selected the human GM-CSF-dependent erythroleukemic cell line TF-1 since generation of the BCR::ABL1 fusion gene may induce factor-independent cell growth.

In the leukemogenesis of the Ph chromosome the significance of the reciprocal ABL1::BCR fusion gene generated as a result of balanced translocation is controversial. In approximately one-third of CML cases reciprocal ABL1::BCR fusion mRNA was undetectable [59] suggesting that the reciprocal ABL1::BCR fusion gene may not be indispensable at least for development of CML. Meanwhile gene transfer of the reciprocal ABL1::BCR fusion cDNA into murine hematopoietic stem cells enhanced proliferation and stem cell capacity of early progenitors [34]. Moreover ABL1::BCR induced the B-cell commitment of murine hematopoietic stem cells and human umbilical cord blood cells. These in vitro models suggest that reciprocal ABL1::BCR might play a role in leukemogenesis by influencing the lineage commitment [34]. However previous Ph+ leukemia models were unable to generate reciprocal ABL1::BCR fusion in combination with BCR::ABL1 fusion. Notably in the present study genomic PCR analysis confirmed the generation of the reciprocal ABL1::BCR fusion gene and the BCR::ABL1 fusion gene. In the FISH analysis of the GM-CSF-independent p210 BCR::ABL1 subline single and double fusion signals were observed in 50% and 46% of the nuclei respectively. Accordingly the cells with a single fusion signal were supposed to have the BCR::ABL1 fusion gene only while those with two fusion signals might have both the BCR::ABL1 and the reciprocal ABL1::BCR fusion genes. Thus at least half the population of the subline did not acquire or lost the reciprocal ABL1::BCR fusion gene during clonal evolution. These observations suggest that the reciprocal ABL1::BCR fusion gene is not indispensable at least for factor-independent growth of TF-1 cells.

The genomic sequences at the BCR::ABL1 and ABL1::BCR fusion sites of the p210 and p190 BCR::ABL1 sublines basically showed direct ligation of two cleavage sites with minor variations. These direct ligations without large insertion or deletion (indel) differed substantially from diverse large indels observed at the cleavage sites of genome editing with CRISPR/Cas9. These differences may be attributed to re-cleavage of the repair site by CRISPR/Cas9. In its usual repairing process by non-homologous end joining a repair site might be repeatedly cleaved until massive indel is acquired [60]. In contrast at the fusion site of two cleavage ends further cleavage could not be induced since the target sequences of sgRNAs are completely disrupted as a result of fusion [61].

Consistent with previous studies [62636465] we confirmed that both GM-CSF and BCR::ABL1 induced phosphorylation of intracellular signaling molecules including STAT5 MAPK and S6K. Moreover the gene expression profile demonstrated that both GM-CSF and BCR::ABL1 upregulated a series of genes involved in cell cycle progression and cell survival. These observations indicate that p210 and p190 BCR::ABL1 induced factor-independent growth of TF-1 cells by constitutively activating intracellular signaling pathways for cell proliferation and cell survival usually regulated by GM-CSF. Considering the factor-independent growth of the BCR::ABL1 sublines we compared the gene expression profile of the BCR::ABL1 sublines and parental cells with that of 59 myeloid leukemia cell lines including 13 Ph-positive cell lines (https://sites.broadinstitute.org/ccle/) and 10 CML patients’ samples (five chronic phase and five blastic crisis samples [66]) by performing two PCAs. However in the whole transcriptome the gene expression profile of Ph-positive myeloid leukemia cell lines (Supplemental Fig. 8a) and that of CML patients’ samples (Supplemental Fig. 8b) were substantially different from that of p210 or p190 BCR::ABL1 sublines and parental cells regardless of whether cultured with GM-CSF or not. We also performed principal component analysis using the 16 genes upregulated by retroviral gene transfer of p210 BCR::ABL1 fusion in HL-60 [67] an acute myeloid leukemia cell line which includes PIM1 oncogene a signaling kinase (a guanine nucleotide exchange factor and Ras homolog) [68] RAPGEF2 a member of the RAS subfamily of GTPases that function in signal transduction [69] HOXB2 SOX5 and KLF1 transcription factors and GAGE antigens a family of cell surface antigens originally identified in melanoma cells. Of note in these 16 genes the gene expression profile of Ph-positive myeloid leukemia cell lines (Supplemental Fig. 8c) and that of CML patients’ samples (Supplemental Fig. 8d) were more similar to that of p210 or p190 BCR::ABL1 sublines than that of parental TF-1 cells. These observations suggested that generation or gene transfer of BCR::ABL1 fusion in human myeloid leukemia cell lines may affect gene expression involved in signal transduction and transcriptional regulation which are upregulated in Ph-positive myeloid leukemia cell lines and CML patients’ samples at least in part. Interestingly although p210 BCR::ABL1 and p190 BCR::ABL1 induced factor-independent cell growth through similar signaling pathways the gene expression profiles of the two sublines were distinctive. In particular myeloid lineage-related genes including CD93 [70] MPL [71] RARB [72] and MECOM [73] were upregulated in the p210 BCR::ABL1 subline compared to the p190 BCR::ABL1 subline. Moreover most of these genes were downregulated by imatinib treatment in the p210 BCR::ABL1 subline but not in the p190 BCR::ABL1 subline. These observations suggest that our cell system might aid further understanding of differences in oncogenic activities between p210 BCR::ABL1 and p190 BCR::ABL1.

Based on our success in TF-1 we have also attempted to generate the Bcr::Abl1 and BCR::ABL1 fusions in the murine Ba/F3 line and in human hematopoietic stem cells purified from cord blood cells respectively using the same strategy. Since we have had no success in these two cellular systems we speculated that TF-1 could have some advantages in generating the BCR::ABL1 fusion with this strategy.

In summary we demonstrated that double cleavages at the breakpoints of BCR and ABL1 genes by the CRISPR/Cas9 system generate a balanced translocation that mimics the Ph chromosome in a human factor-dependent leukemia cell line indicating that simultaneous DSBs at the BCR and ABL1 breakpoints could be initiation events in Ph+ leukemia oncogenesis. Although the utility of the simultaneous introduction of the DSBs by the CRISPR/Cas9 system for the generation of BCR::ABL1 fusion is limited to TF-1 cells thus far our strategy may provide a novel platform for functional evaluation of the oncogenic activities of BCR::ABL1 in the near future.

Testament to that is its electrical and electronics (E&E) industry which grew from humble beginnings in the early 1970s to become a major global player today.

Malaysia Semiconductor Industry Association (MSIA) president Datuk Seri Wong Siew Hai attributed that to people having a can-do mindset and burning desire to succeed.

“Like the American Dream there is a Penang Dream. Anyone looking for greener pastures will find it in Penang.

“The grass is greener here because we have visionary leaders and passionate individuals watering and nurturing it every day” he said.

He was speaking at the MSIA Penang E&E 50th Anniversary celebration dinner in George Town.

In attendance were Penang Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow US Ambassador to Malaysia Brian McFeeters representatives from key government agencies and about 340 industry captains and members.

Taking the crowd down memory lane Wong said the loss of Penang’s free port status in 1967 provided an indirect catalyst for the birth of its E&E sector.

As unemployment rose to 16% in 1969 then chief minister Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu proposed to set up a Free Trade Zone on former plantation land in Bayan Lepas.

It got the blessing of the late Tun Abdul Razak Hussein who headed the National Operations Council an emergency administrative body that governed the country from 1969 to 1971.

In 1972 eight pioneering companies often referred to as the ‘8 samurai’ came in.

They were AMD (now TF-AMD) Clarion Hewlett-Packard (now Keysight Technologies and Agilent Technologies) Hitachi (now Renesas Electronics) Intel Corporation Litronix (now Osram Opto Semiconductors) National Semiconductor (no longer present) and Robert Bosch.

“With E&E powering Penang for the past half century its GDP has grown from RM964mil in 1972 to RM99bil in 2021. This is the equivalent of adding RM2bil every year.

“Penang was also the fastest growing economy of Malaysia in 2021 at 6.8%. The national average was 3.1%” Wong said to applause from the floor.

The state he said was regarded as the Silicon Valley of the East and stood at the forefront in manufacturing the latest semiconductor and electronics products.

He noted that the technological advancements since then were a far cry from the early 1970s when Intel launched its 4004 microprocessor using 10-micron technology with 2300 transistors in the die.

“Today we are talking about 7nm technology with about five to six billion transistors in the die an almost two million-fold increase.

“In 1980 typical storage was 10MB in a 5.25-inch HDD. Today it is 2TB on a micro SD card 8TB on the size of a credit card and 32TB on the size of a ruler a three million-fold increase.

“And these leading edge products are manufactured in Penang” he said highlighting that many E&E companies were leading in sustainability adoption today.

An example is Western Digital’s plant in Batu Kawan which in April was designated a “Sustainability Lighthouse” by the World Economic Forum – the first in Asia and one of only six worldwide said Wong.

Such achievements he said would have seemed unimaginable and far-fetched in the 1980s or even at the turn of the millennium which further underscored how far the industry had come.

However the journey had not been without adversity he said.

Over the five decades there had been fires floods power outages and water shortages with more recently Covid-19 and lockdowns said Wong.

“The people of Penang not only managed to overcome all these challenges but also came out stronger every time.

“I hope our leaders will continue to lay the paths and build the roads for future generations to continue to prosper and be globally competitive” he added.

Among the top leadership of companies present was TF-AMD Penang managing director Neoh Soon Ee who said they were proud to have been part of the success story.

“The state government has always been investor-friendly. Penang has good infrastructure no natural disasters and a highly-skilled English speaking workforce.

“It is a standout proposition for investors” said Neoh.

In his speech Chow said Penang’s industrialisation journey – from a low-cost manufacturing hub to a strategic site for Industry 4.0 digitalisation research and development (R&D) and advanced manufacturing activities – had also brought beneficial economic spillovers for the country.

Penang now contributes over 5% of global semiconductor sales and makes up close to 60% of Malaysia’s overall E&E exports.

It topped the country’s list with an all-time high export of RM354bil in 2021 generating a trade surplus of RM101bil.

For the first half of 2022 export value rose 28% year-on-year to RM216bil representing 29% of Malaysia’s total.

In terms of investment performance Chow said the manufacturing and service industries collectively attracted a record high of RM84bil in 2021.

“We are grateful for the continued confidence of investors and will strive to uphold this conducive ecosystem to stimulate the advancement of strategic industries for the next 50 years and beyond.

“This includes having various STEM initiatives aimed towards building a healthy talent pipeline to meet industry demands.

“With Industry 4.0 spurring changes in many aspects of the world we inhabit today having a well-developed E&E ecosystem not only enables Penang to move up the value chain but also opens up countless opportunities in other areas” he added.

Chow said this included the digital economy which had been accelerated globally by the pandemic.

The sector he said was expected to create over 500000 jobs and contribute 23% of the country’s GDP by 2025.

The highlight of the gala dinner was the launch of the MSIA Silicon North Map plotting all the E&E-related companies’ sites on the island and mainland.

Recognition scrolls were also given to companies celebrating 50 years in Malaysia.

MSIA also presented an RM80000 contribution to Tech Dome Penang in support of its STEM initiatives for children which was received by Penang Deputy Chief Minister II Dr P. Ramasamy.

Also present at the dinner were Malaysia Productivity Corporation director-general Datuk Abdul Latif Abu Seman Penang Chief Minister’s special investment adviser Datuk Seri Lee Kah Choon Penang Development Corporation CEO Datuk Aziz Bakar InvestPenang CEO Datuk Loo Lee Lian MSIA vice-presidents Datuk P’ng Soo Hong and Datuk Lim Yong Jin and several state executive council members.

McFeeters later announced that the US was committed to building stronger business ties with Penang and bolstering environmental social and governance (ESG) standards.

He met with corporate leaders and senior government representatives during his two-day visit to Penang and participated in a round-table hosted by the American Malaysia Chamber of Commerce.

“I am thrilled that Penang continues to be a solid partner with US companies in promoting high-tech investments skilled job opportunities global ESG standards and supply chain resiliency.

“We are committed to strengthening the enduring commercial partnership between the US and Malaysia for many more years to come” added McFeeters.",,,

LIVINGSTON PARISH- Starting in October surveyors will take a look at what is underneath Lake Maurepas using sound waves similar to sonar.

""You're setting off little tiny seismic charges that send vibrations down to the earth and you're reading what comes back to see what sort of layers you have"" Patrick Courreges with the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources said.

The plan is to create a 3D map as deep as two miles under the lake to find the safest places to store carbon dioxide rather than letting it escape into the atmosphere.

""You're looking for layers that protect upward movement from that area"" Courreges said

It's an effort by Air Products and Chemicals Incorporated to lower greenhouse gas emissions.

""Projects like this one that make all of that possible"" Governor John Bel Edwards said during a previous press conference.

Last year Governor Edwards announced the company is building a blue hydrogen Clean energy complex in Ascension Parish.

""Carbon dioxide generated in the manufacturing process will be captured removed and permanently sequestered instead of being released into the atmosphere"" Edwards said.

""In 2026 this clean energy complex will produce 750 million cubic feet a day of clean hydrogen. To put it in perspective that's enough energy to drive 3 million cars"" Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer of Air Products Seifi Ghasemi said.



Officials say this process is the future of energy and there's nothing to worry about by storing carbon dioxide under the lake. The survey will end in the spring.

Meanwhile there are some concerns. The Livingston Parish council will introduce an ordinance on Thursday meant to at least pause issuing new permits so members can learn more about the process.

""We think it's more safe in the ground than the air but what does it do to our drinking water? Is there potential for leaks? What is the plan if there is a disaster? We just haven't been able to get that information for our people asking for it"" Randy Delatte Livingston Parish Councilman district 8 said.

Officials with Exoduas who will be conducting the survey say it will not disturb recreational use of the lake.

Air Products released this statement; ""A subsurface survey provides a visual inspection of underground geology. It is being conducted as part of the permitting process. Understanding the geology of the area helps ensure the selection of the optimal places to permanently sequester carbon dioxide (CO2) approximately one mile beneath the lake. Lake Maurepas has safely undergone several similar studies in the past. These surveys follow proven processes to assure the safe collection of data regarding the geology beneath the lake and the surrounding area. Air Products’ Louisiana Clean Energy Complex to be built in Ascension Parish is to be onstream in 2026. The facility will provide approximately 2000+ construction jobs over three years and 170 new permanent jobs with and average salary over $93000.""

Overview of California’s Ports

California has 12 ports through which large volumes of goods are both imported and exported internationally. These ports vary in size operations and finances. For example the state contains the nation’s two largest ports the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach—both operated by public entities—as well as a small privately owned port the Port of Benicia. In recent years California’s ports have faced several challenges including congestion and air pollution from associated facilities and vehicles. Both the California state government as well as the federal government have engaged in legislative regulatory and budgetary efforts to help ports address these challenges. In particular the Legislature has prioritized ports in recent sessions by convening informational hearings proposing and adopting policy bills and providing targeted funding in the state budget. In this post we provide some background on ports in California. We describe how ports across the state operate and are funded summarize two important issues concerning ports—port congestion and air quality and review recent state and federal actions regarding ports.

Ports in the Larger Goods Movement System

Businesses Move Goods Using Multiple Modes of Transportation. In order to produce and deliver goods and services to consumers businesses often have to transport them from one place to another. Businesses might use several modes of transportation to move goods such as ships freight rail planes and commercial trucks. Goods are moved through different types of facilities such as ports distribution centers and warehouses. As an example Figure 1 shows one pathway which goods that originate from overseas could take from the point of production to the consumer.

Ports Are an Important Component of International Commerce. Ports are facilities where goods are loaded and unloaded from ships as well as where goods are processed and prepared for further distribution to retailers and consumers. Ports handle a significant portion of international commerce. For example waterborne vessels were the leading transportation mode for international freight in 2020 moving 40 percent of U.S. international freight value (worth more than $1.5 trillion) and 70 percent of freight by weight (almost 1.5 trillion tons).

California Ports’ Operations and Funding

California Ports Vary in Size and Types of Goods Handled. California has a total of 12 ports. Eleven of these are publicly owned and one—the Port of Benicia—is privately owned. These ports process about 40 percent of all containerized imports and 30 percent of all exports in the United States. The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are the largest ports in the United States as measured by container volume. Each California port differs in the types of goods it processes as shown in Figure 2. For example some of the Port of Oakland’s highest value exports are food related—fruits and nuts meats and wines and spirits—because of its role in transporting goods from agricultural businesses in the region. In contrast the Humboldt Bay Harbor District primarily imports and exports logs and wood chips due to the lumber businesses in its region.

Several State Agencies Support California’s Ports. State involvement with ports in California is distributed across several agencies including the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) California State Transportation Agency (CalSTA) California Air Resources Board (CARB) and Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development (GO-Biz). Each entity has different responsibilities regarding both ports as well as goods movement in general. Caltrans leads the state planning processes for freight transportation which includes ports. CARB regulates the emissions of ports and enforces state goals for ports to transition to zero-emission technologies. GO-Biz assists ports by facilitating meetings with local state and federal representatives on issues impacting California’s freight movement. As discussed below the state also recently established a new freight policy team at CalSTA.

Ports Are Eligible to Apply for Few State Grants. Ports in California are primarily funded by lease and fee revenues from shipping businesses and freight operators. Currently no ongoing state funding is dedicated to port operations or infrastructure projects. Instead port projects are eligible to receive funding through a few competitive state funding programs designed primarily for developing and maintaining infrastructure. These programs include the Trade Corridor Enhancement Program (TCEP) (about $400 million in state funds and $120 million in federal funds available annually) several Low Carbon Transportation programs administered by CARB (funding varies annually) and a couple of programs administered by the California Energy Commission for charging infrastructure. Ports have received some funding through these programs in recent years. For example in 2021-22 TCEP provided $4.4 million to the Port of Stockton for rail improvements and $8 million to the Port of Long Beach for rail expansion. (Private businesses that operate within ports—such as truck owner-operators—also are eligible for some competitive state grants mainly to purchase zero-emission vehicles.) Most of these programs are funded with special funds such as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (which receives revenues from the state’s cap-and-trade program). In addition to these programs the state recently provided $1.2 billion on a one-time basis for port infrastructure which is discussed in a later section of this post. Because funding is awarded on a competitive basis state funding does not make up a significant portion of ports’ budgets. For example state funds contributed less than 1.2 percent of the Port of Long Beach’s budget in 2020-21.

Ports Are Also Eligible for Several Federal Grants. Similar to state funding there is no ongoing federal funding dedicated to California’s port operations or infrastructure projects. Port projects are eligible to receive funding from several competitive federal programs including the Port Infrastructure Development Program (PIDP) and the Marine Highway Program. In 2021 PIDP provided $241 million in grants and the Marine Highway Program awarded $12.6 million in grants nationwide. (These programs have been significantly augmented for the next several years due to the federal Infrastructure and Investment Jobs Act (IIJA) which we discuss in a later section of this post.) California projects have regularly received funding through PIDP in the last several years including $32.7 million in 2019 $10 million in 2020 and $57.5 million in 2021. Ports are also eligible for competitive federal programs that fund different types of transportation projects. For example the Local and Regional Project Assistance Grants Program funds transportation projects that have significant local or regional impacts. Ports are eligible applicants along with other entities such as states other local government agencies and tribes. As with state funds federal funds typically make up a relatively small share of ports’ budgets. For example federal funds contributed less than 1 percent of the Port of San Francisco’s budget in 2020-21.

California Ports and Air Quality

Vehicles and Equipment at Ports Are Significant Sources of Air Pollution. Ships trucks and cargo handling equipment at ports are often fueled by diesel and therefore emit air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Given the significance of port-related air pollution in local air quality ports have taken some action to reduce emissions of air pollutants in their core activities. For example in 2006 the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles adopted a Clean Air Action Plan which contains a number of pollution reduction programs and strategies. As a result of implementing this plan and other strategies between 2005 and 2020 the ports reported significant reductions in PM NOx and sulfur oxides emissions. However the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach remain some of the largest sources of air pollution in the South Coast Air Basin. These ports are responsible for about 10 percent of the basin’s total NOx emissions. As discussed below a rise in congestion at California’s ports has further increased their airborne emissions in recent years.

Port-Related Air Pollution Impacts Public Health and the Environment. Air pollution from port activities has significant public health and environmental implications. For example exposure to air pollution is associated with an increased risk of heart and lung disease increased cancer risk and increased respiratory symptoms. Harmful emissions also have been associated with negative impacts on birth and developmental outcomes such as contributing to low birth weight premature births and lower lung function in children. In addition diesel fuel consumption emits greenhouse gases which accelerates climate change.

Port-Related Air Pollution Disproportionately Impacts Disadvantaged Communities. Communities that neighbor ports face the highest exposure of air pollutants from port operations. As a result these communities tend to experience a disproportionate share of the pollution burden in the state. For example nearly all of the census tracts that surround the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles are ranked in the top one-third of the most pollution burdened in the state according to the California Communities Environmental Health Screening Tool (CalEnviroScreen) a tool which assesses communities’ pollution burden and vulnerability. In addition to greater exposure these communities also are relatively more vulnerable to pollution impacts. This is because these areas tend to have (1) a higher share of sensitive populations—those with physiological conditions such as asthma and heart disease that make them more vulnerable to pollutants—and (2) socioeconomic factors associated with higher pollution vulnerability such as poverty and lower educational attainment. This combination of disproportionately high pollution exposure and vulnerability results in the neighborhoods adjacent to the Long Beach and Los Angeles ports scoring in the top quartile for their overall CalEnviroScreen assessment. Such a score indicates high levels of cumulative environmental and health impacts and identifies these areas as “disadvantaged communities” eligible for prioritized funding from certain state programs.

State and Local Regulators Have Increased Efforts to Manage Ports’ Air Quality Impacts. In the last several years CARB has adopted several regulations aimed at controlling air pollution from both ships and vehicles at ports. For example in 2007 CARB adopted an “At-Berth Regulation” that requires ships to control pollution while docked. As another example in 2018 CARB adopted regulations which require all drayage trucks to be registered with CARB and meet specific emission standards. Local regulators also have increased their efforts to regulate air pollution in and around ports. For example the South Coast Air Quality Management District which encompasses the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles currently is developing regulations that would require ports to significantly reduce emissions from their operations. Though the specific details of the regulations are not yet finalized they could include measures such as port-wide average emissions targets. The regulations are expected to be finalized in 2023.

Ports Are Planning Electrification Projects to Meet State Air Quality Regulatory Requirements and Goals. Many ships trucks and cargo handling equipment at ports still use diesel fuel which as noted above results in the emission of several harmful air pollutants. To reduce these emissions in the long term ports will need to electrify their heavy-duty fleets. However several barriers impede ports’ progress in pursuing this goal including: (1) certain electric vehicles and equipment are not yet widely available (2) costs are high and (3) current battery reliability may not suit port operations. Given these uncertainties the time line associated with implementing zero-emission technologies at ports is unclear and costs likely are high. Given the scope of the types of equipment and vehicles that will need to be electrified across all California ports the costs could easily reach billions of dollars.

Recent Rise in Port Congestion

Recent Increase in Goods Volume Has Resulted in Port Congestion. In the last year ports have experienced higher than normal levels of congestion. Several factors including greater consumer demand for goods labor disputes and protests as well as COVID-19-related port closures and labor shortages have helped lead to a record volume of cargo accumulating at many ports.

Port Congestion Likely Contributing to Rising Consumer Prices. Across all goods and services purchased by U.S. consumers prices have risen by 8.5 percent over the past year which reflects a considerably faster growth rate than recent history. Increasing consumer prices primarily result from a surge in the amount of goods consumers want to buy combined with businesses struggling to produce and deliver those goods. One result of this dynamic is a dramatic increase in ocean freight costs which businesses may pass on to consumers through higher prices. Port congestion appears to be a key driver of rising freight costs. Port congestion also may reduce the availability of some goods to retailers which could in turn increase the prices of some of those goods for consumers.

Congestion Has Increased Emissions at Ports. Due to greater congestion more ships have had to anchor offshore waiting to load and offload goods. Anchored ships require the use of auxiliary engines which emit NOx and PM. As a result containership emissions were particularly high in the fall of 2021. According to CARB’s estimates as of October 2021 increased port congestion resulted in overall containership emissions increases of 20 tons per day (tpd) of NOx and 0.5 tpd of PM in the South Coast Air Basin relative to average pre-pandemic baseline levels. While containership emissions at ports have since returned to baseline levels—primarily due to recently implemented policies that require ships to wait further offshore—overall port-related emissions have continued to exceed pre-pandemic levels. This is due to the higher than normal volume of goods at ports leading to increased activity from cargo handling equipment and drayage trucks moving goods to and from ships and other modes of transport. These vehicles often are powered by fuel combustion engines which also emit air pollutants such as NOx and PM. As a result CARB estimates that over the last several months NOx and PM emissions from port-related equipment such as port trucks regional rail and cargo handling equipment have exceeded baseline levels by 6.3 tpd of NOx and 0.1 tpd of PM.

Increased Demand for Goods Has Led to Calls for Expanding Ports’ Capacity. Many port infrastructure projects help improve the capacity of ports to process goods. For example port deepening projects make navigation channels deeper and wider which helps to accommodate larger ships that can carry more goods. As another example a project expanding freight railyards at ports could increase goods movement capacity if more freight rail can pick up and drop off goods. Because the recent increase in demand for goods has strained ports’ goods movement capacity ports have begun planning infrastructure projects to make improvements. For instance according to the California Association of Ports (which represents all of the publicly operated ports in the state) port authorities have identified $3.6 billion in infrastructure projects that could be potential candidates for state or federal infrastructure grant programs.

Recent State Actions to Address Port Congestion and Air Quality

Governor Issued Executive Order Aimed at Reducing Port Congestion. In October 2021 Governor Newsom issued Executive Order N-19-21 which directed state agencies to identify additional ways to alleviate congestion at California’s ports. In response the Department of General Services (DGS) identified six surplus state properties in proximity to highly congested ports which can store up to 20000 containers. The state plans to lend these properties to support port operations for one year with an option to renew for another year. At the time of this writing DGS had leased these properties to a warehousing company that will work with importers to store containers on these sites. In addition CalSTA and the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) entered into an Emerging Projects Agreement under which CalSTA developed a list of goods movement infrastructure projects for which USDOT will provide technical assistance to develop and apply for federal funding opportunities.

Legislature Has Prioritized Ports in Recent Sessions. In recent years the Legislature has engaged on several budget and policy efforts regarding ports. For example as shown in Figure 3 the Legislature has committed nearly $1.9 billion in one-time funds over the next several years for port-related issues such as infrastructure projects workforce development and operational improvements. The Legislature has prioritized port issues through nonbudgetary channels as well such as by convening the Assembly Select Committee on Ports and Goods Movement for two hearings one on congestion (November 2021) and another on the impact of port congestion on agriculture (February 2022). The Legislature is also considering a number of policy bills that are still pending at the time of this writing.

2022-23 Budget Includes Funding for Freight Policy Team at CalSTA. With the goal of supporting a more cohesive approach towards freight policy—including at ports—the 2022-23 budget package established a new freight policy team under CalSTA to play a coordinating role and included positions for the team on a three-year limited-term basis with a reporting requirement on its efforts. This report is intended to inform future decisions on an ongoing approach to improving coordination of statewide freight policy.

Recent Federal Actions to Address Port Congestion and Air Quality

Significant New Funding for Port Infrastructure. In November 2021 IIJA was signed into law. The act provides $1.2 trillion for infrastructure nationwide including about $17 billion for ports and waterways. Most of this funding is targeted for federally owned infrastructure through the Army Corps of Engineers General Services Administration U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Department of Homeland Security. About $2.7 billion is available for non-federally owned port infrastructure to be distributed through three competitive programs over the next five years: (1) $2.3 billion through PIDP (2) $400 million through the new Reduction of Truck Emissions at Port Facilities Program and (3) $25 million through the Marine Highways Program. California’s ports are eligible to apply for these funds. Currently all of these federal programs have begun the funding allocation process for federal fiscal year 2022. Each of these programs require a 20 percent funding match from a nonfederal source which could include state funding.

In addition to the funding included in IIJA the federal government recently enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 which includes $3 billion for ports to reduce air pollution and carbon emissions. Of this amount about $2.3 billion will be available on a competitive basis for all ports and $750 million through competitive grants for ports in areas that do not meet federal air quality standards. Several ports in California likely will be eligible for the latter grant.

White House Issued Action Plan for Ports and Waterways. Alongside the enactment of IIJA in November 2021 the Biden administration announced a set of near- and longer-term actions to improve port and waterway infrastructure. These included efforts to accelerate federal grant awards identify and develop port infrastructure projects and facilitate data sharing to support supply chain efficiency.

Conclusion

California’s ports have significant implications for both the state’s economy as well as the environment. As a crucial component of the global supply chain efficiency and capacity at ports are critical to ensure the cost-effectiveness and timeliness of goods movement both for consumers as well as businesses. In addition ports remain significant sources of air pollution and emissions which are associated with negative public health outcomes and are detrimental to the state’s climate change mitigation efforts. These issues have only heightened with the recent port congestion challenges—highlighting the need for port infrastructure to expand capacity and efficiency as well as improve technologies and equipment to reduce air quality impacts. These issues will confront the Legislature in the coming years as it seeks to further improve goods movement and air quality at California’s ports.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9leGNsdXNpdmUtcmV0YWlsLXRlY2gtc3RhcnQtbGlseS0xNTQ1NDc5MzUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EXCLUSIVE: Retail Tech Start-up Lily AI Secures $25 Million Series B Funding,"PARIS — Lily AI a product attributes platform that ensures fashion companies and consumers speak the same language has closed a $25 million Series B round.

The round saw the participation of new and returning investors including Canaan Partners Conductive Ventures Sorenson Ventures and New Enterprise Associates.

More from WWD

The new financial backing is meant to support the California-based start-up’s plans to grow its business further into mid-market retail e-commerce brands; branch out into home and beauty and expand geographically with an eye toward the U.K. and Europe. It also plans to offer further applications within the retail stack.

Lily AI was created in 2015 by entrepreneurs Sowmiya Chocka Narayanan and Purva Gupta as an AI-empowered app with emotional intelligence for fashion shoppers with initial funding from investors such as Unshackled Ventures an early-stage venture capital fund for immigrant-founded start-ups.

Initially the female-led company looked to build an emotional intelligence-powered shopping experience available through an iOS app that used machine learning to understand a woman’s preference and body perception to offer confidence-boosting recommendations.

Its seed funding round led by NEA and Unshackled Ventures raised $2 million. In 2020 it secured $12.5 million in Series A funding from Canaan Partners NEA and Fernbrook Capital Management which allowed the company to pivot from its earlier app-based solution toward an enterprise product offering that focuses on creating customer-centered product taxonomies to improve e-commerce site search demand forecasting merchandise planning product recommendations and discovery as well as search engine optimization and marketing.

“The language of the consumer is basically where we use deep image recognition technology [and] industry-leading AI capabilities [to] read images and text extracting attributes that matter to the end consumer” Gupta the company’s chief executive officer explained to WWD.

Gupta said the Series B funding arrives “at an interesting point where we have proven with the first few applications [where] we’ve been able to solve a technology problem through image recognition.” It has then shown fashion companies the impact that feeding the resulting product attributes could have on the short term which the executive estimated at up to 10 percent of a business’ revenue. It counts Bloomingdale’s Gap Inc. Macy’s and ThredUp among its U.S.-based clients and the executive said they were in talks with “a very large U.K.-based retailer.”

The key learning of what Purva deemed a “really good validation and product market fit” phase is that “it’s become very evident that product attributes are really underused which is a massive opportunity for retail” she continued where in time the taxonomies developed using Lily AI could impact the whole retail value chain influencing anything from assortments offered to the copy written in product descriptions.

Gupta said Lily AI was a lone player that addressed the quality of the data being fed into systems a pain point for companies which are constantly challenged to upgrade their enterprise tools across the retail value chain.

“Nobody wanted to solve the hard problem and do the dirty work. You get a new search engine you get a new recommendation engine you get a new demand forecasting application [and] the first thing that they asked the brand or retailer is ‘can you give me your product attribute data?’ That today is being done manually [using] vernacular inaccurate incomplete [taxonomies] so everybody is just building on top of bad data” she said.

Describing founders Gupta and Narayanan as “leaders capable of redefining a sector” who “developed a world-class scalable platform that’s reinventing modern retail” Maha Ibrahim general partner at Canaan stated that “Lily AI has proven the power of product attribution in empowering shoppers boosting conversions and increasing revenues for some of retail’s most admired brands. We’re excited to see what’s next.”

Scientists have found a new way to break down a group of harmful chemicals that are very hard to get rid of. The discovery could help solve a dangerous and growing problem – how to clean up the pollution of “forever chemicals”.

The group of chemicals known as PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are pretty amazing. They’re non-stick waterproof and grease-proof. They don’t burn easily and they don’t dissolve in water. It’s easy to understand how scientists got excited about them when they were discovered over 80 years ago.

Businesses started putting PFAS in all sorts of products from non-stick pans to waterproof clothes and from fire-fighting foam to rugs that resist stains. Even things like food wrappers and floss for cleaning your teeth contain PFAS chemicals.

But after a while scientists realized that the same things that made the chemicals useful also caused a real problem – PFAS doesn’t break down in nature. It doesn’t dissolve in water or burn. Not even bacteria can break PFAS down. That’s why these chemicals are known as “forever chemicals”.

As a result PFAS builds up in the environment. The chemicals are found in air water and dirt around the world – and in animals and people. In the US 97% of humans have PFAS in their blood. Sadly PFAS chemicals are also toxic and have been linked to many health problems.

There are thousands of kinds of PFAS. You can’t see PFAS pollution the same way you can see plastic pollution because what sticks around are tiny molecules made of atoms that are connected together.

Molecules of PFAS chemicals have chains of carbon and fluorine atoms. The carbon and fluorine atoms are connected so tightly that they just don’t want to come apart.

Now scientists in the US have found a way to break down some PFAS chemicals. Their solution requires boiling PFAS with two other very common chemicals.* These chemicals can be found in just about any laboratory.

Dr. Brittany Trang one of the scientists involved said she didn’t even want to test the idea at first. “I thought it was too simple” she said. But the process worked.

Attached to the chain of carbon and fluorine atoms many PFAS molecules have a “head” made of other atoms. The new process made that head fall off. That allowed the chain of carbon and fluorine atoms to “unzip” breaking the bonds between them. The chemicals fell apart – most of them in just a few hours.

The research involved 10 types of PFAS including two of the most common kinds. That’s a big step. But there are over 12000 different kinds of PFAS so there’s still a lot of work to do.

The researchers are trying to figure out how to easily process large amounts of PFAS.

It’s important to note that the new method can only break down PFAS that have already been collected. Figuring out how to remove PFAS chemicals from the environment and collect them remains a huge challenge.

These chemicals are called PFAS which stands for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances but they’ve also earned the moniker “forever chemicals” for how difficult they are to remove from the environment.

In a new study published last week in the journal Science researchers destroyed PFAS by mixing them with water a soap ingredient and a common solvent. When they boiled the solution most of the PFAS broke down into harmless byproducts in a matter of hours and the rest broke down within days according to the New York Times’ Carl Zimmer.

The new technique only destroys some types of PFAS. But it could be simpler and cheaper than current methods for degrading the chemicals according to Science’s Robert F. Service.

“This is the first time I’ve seen a degradation mechanism where I thought ‘this could actually make a difference’” Shira Joudan an environmental chemist at York University in Toronto Canada who wasn’t involved in the study tells Nature News’ Giorgia Guglielmi.

PFAS have been used in industry and consumer products since the 1940s. They’ve been added into food packaging nonstick cookware furniture cosmetics and other items. To manufacturers these chemicals were an attractive choice: They don’t react with other molecules so they repel water and grease writes Gizmodo’s Lauren Leffer.

“The chemicals were originally designed by companies to be stable—that was a feature but once they get into the environment it’s a flaw” Joudan tells Nature News.

Manufacturing facilities have released PFAS into the air and companies have dumped the chemicals in rivers where they can last for generations per the Times. Now the United States has almost 3000 PFAS-contaminated sites according to Science. “We’ve really polluted the whole world with this stuff” William Dichtel co-author of the new study and a chemist at Northwestern University tells the Times.

Since PFAS don’t break down on their own they accumulate in drinking water soil and air and eventually make their way into our bodies per Gizmodo. One study estimates that PFAS can be found in the blood of 97 percent of Americans.

Scientists have tied low chronic levels of PFAS exposure to a number of health problems including increased risk of cancer liver damage low birth weight and reduced immunity according to the Times.

Researchers have long been looking for effective inexpensive and safe ways to get rid of the chemicals. They can be filtered out of water but if they’re then put in a landfill they’ll eventually leach into the soil per Science. Scientists have tried incinerating PFAS but this expensive strategy still allows some of the chemicals to survive and escape into the air according to the Times.

While the new PFAS-destroying technique is promising it’s not a silver bullet experts say. There are thousands of types of PFAS and the method worked for just one major class of them per Gizmodo. And Dichtel tells the Times that a lot of work needs to be done before the technique can be used outside the lab.

Plus the new method’s value is only in destroying PFAS that have already been filtered out of water. It “would really not be good” to just dump the PFAS-dissolving soap and solvent into the water supply says chemist Brittany Trang the study’s lead researcher to Gizmodo.

Still this is a step toward a PFAS solution. “It’s a neat method; it’s different from other ones that have been tried” Chris Sales an environmental engineer at Drexel University who was not involved in the study tells Science News’ Jude Coleman. “The biggest question is how could this be adapted and scaled up?”"

“Our crew’s lucky to spend the summer cruising the Great Lakes aboard the friendliest tugboat in Canada. I’m so excited Theodore TOO fans have the chance to take part in his adventures! As your Host I can’t wait to show you around from bow to stern and take you on your own Big Harbour adventure for a night.” Captain Noah

It’s the first time that Theodore TOO will be available to non-crew members for an overnight stay so Captain Noah and the crew have worked to tidy up the flotsam and jetsam and get our red-capped tugboat shipshape.

Once on deck guests will embark on a cruise of Hamilton Harbour with some of Theodore TOO’s finest crew members learning all about the Bay. Keep a weather eye out for some of the ancient creatures rumored to lurk beneath the harbor’s surface too.

The Captain and his crew will treat guests to a few square meals with local eats from Hamilton supporting some of the small businesses that play such an important role in the city.

Once the sun sets over the horizon guests can lounge on the deck for a movie night under the stars surrounded by the harbor and plenty of snacks – with saltwater taffy being a must.

Lithium fever is into its third year in Western Australia and it shows few signs of slowing. Hard rock lithium mining projects are being commissioned as global prices for the battery mineral soar. Plans to upgrade lithium ore or spodumene to battery grade are also on the slate as concerns about value adding and energy security ramp up. New projects are being revealed with increasing frequency thanks in part to a supportive business environment.

As the world’s single largest lithium region ahead of Chile the Australian state has a critical role to play in the world’s energy future. S&P Global’s vice chairman Daniel Yergin recently stressed the importance of the country in boosting mineral supplies for renewable technologies. The Pulitzer Prize winner gained global recognition in 2011 when he criticised a widely held belief that soaring oil prices would cause a global economic crisis. Instead he said it would stimulate production. The same conviction is proving true now with lithium. Last month in Sydney Yergin told an energy forum that the resilience of lithium supply chains and their security would be important in reaching current climate goals. “Australia will have a very important role to play in the new supply chains for net zero” he said.

Australia is well endowed with hard rock lithium deposits especially in Western Australia. Indeed it ranks ahead of Chile as the world’s leading producer. Right now the comparative ease in planning new projects strong government support and rising global demand provide a significant edge. Downstream processing plants are also being constructed to ensure that the value of lithium exports can be maximised rather than only shipping lithium ore to offshore processors.

Lithium Power International’s lithium mining interests

The giant Greenbushes lithium mining project operates in the south-west of the State near Bunbury. A slew of newcomers including Lithium Power International have been quick to peg nearby leases because there are enticing signs that the mineralisation spreads beyond the ground held by the mine’s owners Tianqi Corp and IGO (51%) and Albemarle Corp (49%). Greenbushes has been running in one form or another for 137 years initially producing tin tantalum and lithium from alluvial deposits. It eventually switched to hard rock mining and it was only in the late 1970s that the potential for high-grade lithium spodumene was taken seriously. The first lithium was produced in 1983 and the mine has been expanded since. Plans are awaiting approval for a third chemical grade lithium plant and a tailings retreatment operation. These projects will provide feedstock for two new lithium hydroxide plants one to be run together by Tianqi and IGO and the other by Albermarle.

Lithium Power International is keenly interested in current developments at Greenbushes because it owns lithium tenements that abut the mine leases. The company has recently agreed to buy four additional tenements to make it the largest holder in the area. It recently completed a ground penetration radar survey to test for concealed pegmatites. Laboratory results show the area is regionally anomalous in lithium and a larger sampling program is being completed.

LPI intends to sell its West Australian assets into a new entity called Western Lithium Ltd so that it can focus attention on developing the Maricunga lithium project in northern Chile with a pre-tax net present value of US$1.97 billion in northern Chile. Approval has been received from the Australian Securities Commission in preparation for the demerger. A new board is expected to be appointed once market conditions improve so that the business can be listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. Existing LPI shareholders will receive shares in the new company and a capital raise will occur to fund ongoing exploration.

LPI has a second grouping of assets in the Pilbara region of Western Australia inland from Port Hedland. A soil sampling program was completed at Pilgangoora recently aimed at assessing lithium anomalies outlined in previous work. There is also the possibility of gold mineralisation given the recent nearby discovery by De Grey Mining of a six-million-ounce-plus deposit at their Hemi deposit. Other lithium projects lie slightly to the north at Tabba Tabba and Strelly. In the Eastern Goldfields region about 650km east of Perth and close to the mining town of Kalgoorlie two more groupings of tenements have been acquired by LPI.

The extent of Western Australia’s lithium potential

Notable among the others miners operating in Western Australia are Allkem Mineral Resources and Liontown Resources. The first of the three Allkem was formed last year via the $A4 billion merger of Galaxy Resources and Orocobre. It has mining and processing operations in Argentina Australia Japan and North America. Its largest single asset is Mt Cattlin in Western Australia’s north-west but production is slowing and cash costs are rising as reserves diminish. The company however has embarked on a significant drilling program at depth and along strike to extend the mine life.

Mineral Resources has been mining nearly 2 million tonnes of spodumene concentrate in recent times from its half-owned Mt Marion mine. The material is toll converted in a lithium hydroxide plant in China by Genfeng. The company this year intends to commission its own hydroxide processing plant at Kemerton in a 40/60 joint venture with Albermarle and add a second train next year.

Liontown differs from the first two because it is newly listed on the Australian Securities Exchange but has a significant lithium resource north of Kalgoorlie. It has 156 million tonnes grading 1.4% lithium oxide. Its ambitions are supported by a $A463 million capital raising last December a $A300 million debt facility with Ford and binding offtake agreements with Tesla and LG Energy. This backing should be sufficient to take its Kathleen Valley mine into full production and yield enough returns to develop its own downstream processing plant after year six of operation.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Great Disruption ushered in by the Covid-19 pandemic the Great Resignation and now the Great Layoff have all fundamentally changed the world of work necessitating a proactive approach to business and talent management. This is particularly true for the tech industry where tech workers have been both more likely to quit their jobs in the last year and have faced sweeping layoffs on the heels of the Great Resignation.

In the midst of this changing tech job landscape organizations need to be more attuned to the needs of their employees. One solution to cultivate thriving tech talent is investing in developing the tech skills of your employees. Pluralsight’s 2022 State of Upskilling Report showed that 48 percent of tech workers surveyed would consider leaving their job if they weren’t given sufficient time and resources for upskilling. Additionally 75 percent of workers said that their organization’s willingness to dedicate resources to developing their tech skills affects their plans to stay with the organization.

Some of the world’s most successful companies have been actively ramping up their upskilling efforts in recent years. Here’s why companies who invest in tech skills are winning.

What Is Upskilling? Upskilling is the process of gaining new abilities that allow employees to perform their jobs more effectively and also take on new ones as well. From a company perspective fostering upskilling is a great way to retain talent.

They Become Aware of Their Strengths and Weaknesses

Organizations who use concrete evidence in their decision-making are often the most successful ones. According to McKinsey data-driven organizations are 23 times more likely to acquire customers and 19 times more likely to be profitable than organizations who don’t emphasize using data in decision making.

A data-driven approach is crucial for aligning your team members with company objectives. One of the first steps in growing a thriving culture of learning that’s also aligned to business needs is to take a data-informed inventory of your employees’ greatest tech skills strengths and weaknesses. Your employees need to understand how skill development efforts are aligned with their current knowledge their personal goals and the company’s future goals.

In my time as a leader at Pluralsight I’ve found that organizations can tend to fall into a few different categories when it comes to tech skills development. Each of these denotes different levels of upskilling maturity. Organizations who are in their tech skills infancy often take an unstructured approach to skills development where there is no organization-wide strategy or culture around upskilling or reskilling. Any learning and skill advancement is motivated by individuals for their own career goals and individual growth.

As organizations start delving deeper into the benefits of tech skills development they may employ a “one-size-fits-all” approach to upskilling meaning that although organization-led training is available it’s broad-based and doesn’t meet the needs of a technology organization.

Ultimately most organizations will hopefully employ a proactive and strategic approach to tech skills development. Organizations that are proactive in assessing their skills development needs are also data-driven using skills assessments and employee feedback to meet technologists where they are on their upskilling journey. Having a keen sense of awareness about where your organization is and where it needs to be in terms of skill development is crucial to long-term success.

They Are Champions of Learning and Employee Growth

The companies that have the most success with skills development efforts are the ones who create a culture of learning within their organization. The State of Upskilling report made clear that employees are hungry for skills development opportunities. In the survey 91 percent of technologists expressed that they wanted to improve their tech skills to fulfill personal career goals. Additionally 86 percent of technologists want their tech skills to align with their organization’s overall strategy.

A great example of an organization who prioritized employee learning and development in a time of massive change is Cendyn a leading cloud service provider for the hospitality industry. During the height of the Covid-19 pandemic Cendyn found themselves operating with a leaner team and having to do more with less. In order to strengthen their technology teams Cendyn invested in skills development resources that allowed them to more effectively weather the storm.

In doing so Cendyn ushered in agile methodologies for their team to help them ship code more quickly with a smaller team. Cendyn employees were also encouraged to explore technologies that weren’t currently employed in the company in order to improve future development and make them well-rounded technologists. The result was an aligned efficient and well-informed team of technologists ready to tackle any future challenges.

Cendyn’s example shows us what’s possible when employers focus on concrete tech skills development for their employees. Though having a culture of learning itself is important operationalizing how to reach key success benchmarks through tech skills development is perhaps more crucial for business success.

They Know Tech Skills Add Value to Customers

The final reason that formalized tech skills development programs set companies apart from their competition is that strong technology teams add more value to customers. Research from Harvard Business Review shows that technology teams contribute to the bottom line of an organization in myriad ways. For instance tech teams can tie innovation efforts to business growth and customer outcomes.

Organizations who don’t prioritize tech skills development are likely underprepared for the rate of technological advancement. According to IBM most business skills have a “half-life” of around five years but tech skills are only relevant for around two-and-a-half years. This means that if your technologists aren’t actively learning new skills while on the job your organization is at risk of lagging behind in the race for technological innovation.

Tech skills development will never be “over” for any organization. There is no defined point at which your technologists have learned everything they need to know in order to be successful. Without a concrete plan for skills development technologists will naturally fall behind the technology curve. I call this idea “skills debt.” Since we know that tech skills stay relevant for such short amounts of time it’s important for my teams to dedicate a percentage of their time each week to chipping away at the skills debt. This way rather than being stuck in a constant game of catch-up technologists are staying ahead of the curve through consistent programmatic skills development.

Foreword

By Amber M. Northern and Michael J. Petrilli

The cost of groceries cars plane tickets— it seems like everything is going up these days. What's not? The number of teenagers going to college. Recent statistics show that 685000 fewer students were enrolled in undergraduate programs (both community colleges and four- year institutions) in spring 2022 than the previous spring. That’s a drop of 4.1 percent—steeper than the 3.5 percent decline the previous spring. To date the college student body has shrunk by nearly 1.4 million or 9.4 percent during the pandemic.

One reason is that younger Americans for better or worse are starting to question the value of college. Among those with a bachelor’s degree or more just 56 percent under age thirty think the benefits of their education exceed the cost. That compares with 82 percent of those age sixty or over.

While postsecondary education obviously remains valuable for students’ career prospects escalating tuition costs—coupled with many young people saying they aren't learning job-ready skills—means that we need to do a much better job preparing both students who choose to go straight into the labor market after high school and those headed to college. One way that high schools can respond to increasing demand for career preparation is by helping their students attain industry-recognized credentials (IRCs).

These are credentials conferred by businesses industry groups or state certifying entities to individuals who demonstrate a sufficient level of knowledge and skills in a particular domain often through one or more assessments. For instance the American Welding Society (AWS) issues several different types of welding certifications pertaining to inspection engineering education and sales.

Students earn IRCs most often through career and technical education (CTE) including “concentrating” in several related CTE courses. Some want an IRC or at least its content for personal reasons—so they can repair their own car cook for their family or even flip houses one day. Others see a high school IRC as part of a stack of credentials to be accumulated a stack that may include some (or a lot of) college and additional vocational and technical instruction.

But the most straightforward reason for a high school IRC is to advance one’s prospects in the workforce. Yet we know almost nothing about whether IRCs better equip high school graduates to gain employment and earn a living wage. Neither do we know whether IRCs earned during high school make it likelier that students will build upon them when choosing college majors.

Texas has taken this seriously. In 2017 the Lone Star legislature directed the Texas Education Agency (TEA) to publish a list of approved IRCs that are recognized and valued by employers and to factor students’ receipt of such IRCs into the state’s school accountability system. After soliciting extensive feedback from employers workforce boards and colleges the TEA constructed a list that consisted of credentials (presumably) aligned with high-wage in-demand occupations that are to be periodically reevaluated. Students who complete an approved IRC in Texas are now deemed to be college career and military ready (CCMR) in the state school accountability ratings.

Now we can see how young Texans with IRCs fare the first year out of high school and can compare them with similar peers who lack IRCs. To our good fortune Matt Giani director of research and data science at the University of Texas–Austin was keen to conduct the study. As the supervisor of research and evaluation activities for OnRamps and Texas OnCourse (two programs meant to augment the pipeline of diverse Texas students attending selective colleges) Professor Giani has a history of successful projects that link Texas K–12 data to postsecondary and workforce outcomes.

We won’t restate his key findings here but we can simply say that we agree with Dr. Giani’s conclusion that high school IRCs are a net positive for students who earn them but are not game changers. Hence our lingering question: How else can we transform the high school experience for students so as to significantly boost their wages and career prospects once they are in the workforce?

Here are four ideas:

1. Stress the key roles of high schools—and middle schools too—in helping students figure out their career interests and aptitudes.

If we really want young people to make the most of their last four years in K–12 education we need high schools to help them align their aptitudes with their interests. This means using middle school to commence career exploration. Grades 5–8 are a good time for students to learn about different career options through exploratory and introductory CTE courses and to develop a plan for reaching future goals1—perhaps gaining some exposure to coding robotics digital media film production and so on all while also learning the essentials of a quality core curriculum.

Nobody is saying that twelve-year-olds should make a major life decision but one way to help students learn about their options is to identify not only what they are interested in but also what they are good at. One of us recently wrote about a new generation of aptitude assessments for middle and high schools where students complete a series of activities (or “brain games”) that “allow them to see career paths for themselves that line up with their aptitudes and are free of the race class and gender biases that tended to plague old-style interest inventories.” Such assessments focus on potential not achievement so “the results often tell kids about strengths in areas the children had thought were weaknesses.”

Strategies like these can open up new career paths for students to explore in middle school as well as get them thinking sooner about which paths they want to take more seriously in high school. If we wait until students are juniors or seniors before we attempt to help them prepare for the world of work we’ve done them a disservice.

2. Embrace approaches that are much more ambitious than IRCs such as serious youth apprenticeship programs.

Exposure to the workforce in high school has generally benefitted students. For instance prior research found that summer employment helps improve school outcomes for low-income youth. What’s more students who work ten or so hours a week during the school year—even as early as grade 9—experience a boost in test scores and in the amount of schooling they complete. Thankfully more states are calling for work-based learning programs which says Jobs for the Future provide “real-world opportunities to apply the lessons learned in classroom settings build professional networks earn money while they learn and get a head start on the road to a career.”

It makes sense then that the culminating high school experience for students choosing to go straight into the workforce should be an in-person hands-on experience in a field in which the student has demonstrated aptitude—ideally by concentrating in a series of sequential CTE courses and earning an IRC in the same industry while engaging in a real-world apprenticeship (or at least the start of one). Such an approach must be high-quality and equitable; hence it’s encouraging that our results show that career and technical programs that lead to IRCs do not constitute a lower educational “track.” Still given historical concerns about adults doing the steering these choices must also be student initiated which leaves open the possibility that many of these students will choose to return to school at a later point in time.

We can imagine a middle or high school continuum that moves students along a series of options ranging from less intensive and less transformational to more intensive and more transformational such as the following:

1. Career exploration

2. CTE course taking

3. CTE concentration

4. IRCs (on top of CTE concentration)

5. Youth apprenticeships

Several states have recently gotten serious about providing high-quality apprenticeships as a capstone experience for young people. Research on them is growing with recent studies finding that apprentices earned significantly more than similar peers who completed only the accompanying course. Other studies find that apprenticeships boost employment and “decrease idleness” among male high school graduates who don’t enroll in college.

CareerWise Colorado for instance operates a program in which participants split their time between high school and the workplace. Apprentices begin in grade 11 and finish in their thirteenth year yielding both an IRC and a chance to earn debt-free college credit. Louisiana's Fast Forward program also gives students a leg up on their career. And Governor Janet Mills of Maine recently announced $12.3 million in grants to expand apprenticeship and pre- apprenticeship programs across her state.

What these and similar programs recognize is that high schools must free up significant time in students’ schedules to accommodate apprenticeships which almost surely means expanding the high school day making generous use of dual-enrollment courses or foregoing some traditional academic requirements.

Louisiana adopted a couple of these approaches in their Fast Forward program:

As part of the Fast Forward program students spend the majority of grades 9 and 10 on the high school campus earning core graduation requirements.

Once they reach grades 11 and 12 students spend the majority of their time on the postsecondary campus or a satellite location while dually enrolled in courses. This ensures students complete their graduation requirements while also earning an associate’s degree or earning on-the-job experience participating in a state- registered pre-apprenticeship/apprenticeship.

3. Encourage stackable credentials.

A great many IRCs worth getting—because they relate to good jobs and authentic careers—cannot be completed while in high school. The high school version is a solid stepping stone however which is why the idea of stackable credentials needs to be taken seriously. As the term implies these credentials build on one another often embedding certifications that help students quickly and cost-effectively gain skills that lead to employment.

Stackable credentials can be more or less useful however as the skills and knowledge earned through some IRCs are more tightly linked to particular industries. The IT and Health Science fields tend to be more amenable to stacking while those in Retail Trade and Manufacturing are less so. For example in the field of radiology students might first gain a limited medical radiologic technologist certificate (LMRT) then a radiologic technology associate degree (RT) and finally a radiologic science management bachelor’s degree.2

A better understanding of the fields that already boast fruitful stackable certifications would benefit workers and employers alike. So would development of more such stacks in high-demand fields. Indeed recent research in Virginia showed how stacking can affect one’s labor-market outcomes. Adults who completed a stacked credential were four percentage points more likely to be employed than non-stackers and earned about $570 more each quarter.

4. Make state accountability systems more selective regarding which high school IRCs count in their college- and career-ready indices.

More than half of states report including K–12 IRC attainment measures in their accountability systems.3 But many of them are awfully lenient in terms of which credentials count as part of college and career readiness.

We need truth in advertising. A certification in a popular desktop program is not the same as one that combines hands-on industry-specific skills and tech-specific software. We might benefit from a credentialing hierarchy perhaps one that distinguishes among “building block” or general readiness skills (such as basic first aid financial literacy and general safety) stackable certifications and capstone credentials that demonstrate mastery or advance careers.

To wit Credentials Matter looked at thirty states and found that Microsoft Office Specialist was the most commonly earned credential (it was second in popularity in this report). But they termed it a “nice to have” because “overall employers do not [specifically] request credentials to prove software competence and most people learn and validate these in-demand skills through other means.” Further “states educators and employers [need] to help students prioritize the credentials that will carry the most value in the workforce given the time and resource constraints inherent in schools.”

We agree. General skills are important to have but do not deserve much weight in a statewide accountability system that prizes high-skill high-wage occupations.4 States need to be more discerning regarding what counts and what doesn’t.

**********

This first-of-its-kind report gives us an in-depth look into the value of IRCs in a state that takes them seriously and has invested in them. We hope that other studies will trace the impact of IRCs in other states and for longer timeframes.

In the meantime we very much need to distinguish between two purposes of IRCs: the “must haves” and the “nice to haves.” As for the latter yes let’s leave room for students to obtain these credentials because they enjoy the work and see real-life value in them. It’s one thing to take some CTE courses while always planning to go to college anyway and it’s fine to get an IRC to pursue an interest unrelated to college or career plans. But let’s not forget that these are industry-recognized credentials. The “must have” is to promote job success. Yet the kind of IRCs you can earn while in high school are often just the tip of the iceberg.5 That’s because most high school IRCs need to be linked to meaningful CTE programs that include high-quality apprenticeship and internship programs and myriad other opportunities to gain additional credentials often including further study of some kind after graduating.

There’s not enough of that happening. That means that policymakers may too readily judge the effectiveness of high schools not on their adoption of high-quality career and workforce pathways but on IRC programs and attainments that in and of themselves don’t add great value to many students’ lives. If we’re serious about helping students to succeed on the job that needs to change.

Introduction

Parents policymakers and much of the public worry that today’s U.S. education system is not adequately preparing youth for life after high school. For decades one of the most prominent approaches for ensuring that students are ready for the labor market has been providing them with career and technical education (CTE) once known as vocational education. Yet historical research finds that vocational education failed to live up to its promise: it stratified educational opportunity by race and class6reduced students’ likelihood of attending college7 diverted students from four-year to two-year colleges 8and transitioned students into careers with limited opportunities for social mobility.9 These findings likely contributed to the decline in CTE course taking between 1990s and early 2010s.10

More recent studies have found less evidence of racial and socioeconomic disparities between students who complete a series of CTE courses (“concentrators”) and those who do not11and more positive relationships between CTE and students’ postsecondary outcomes.12 Coinciding with Congress’s passage of the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act (“Perkins V”) in 2018 there has been a resurgence in research policy activity and school reform related to CTE in recent years: in 2019 alone twenty-eight states passed legislation related to career tech.13

An increasingly prominent strategy for ensuring that CTE programs develop knowledge and skills that are actually aligned to the workplace is to provide students with opportunities to earn industry-recognized credentials (IRCs) while in high school. IRCs are credentials conferred by businesses (e.g. Microsoft) industry groups (e.g. the National Center for Construction Education and Research or NCCER) or state certifying entities (e.g. the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation or TDLR) to individuals who demonstrate a sufficient level of knowledge and skills in a particular domain often through one or more assessments. They are intended to prepare both students who plan to enter the workplace directly after high school for a career and college goers who want to build upon their IRC-related skills and capabilities in a postsecondary setting. In fact the Texas Administrative Code says that industry certifications should be “portable” in part meaning they can “be transferred seamlessly to postsecondary work through acceptance for credit or hours in core program courses at an institution of higher education.”14

Thus while many IRCs require a bachelor’s degree (e.g. teaching licenses) or graduate degree (e.g. medical licenses) more than half of states now provide opportunities for students to earn other types of IRCs while in high school.15 In fact forty-two out of forty-five states that responded to a national survey in 2019 reported that students in their state could earn some IRCs during high school.16Although eligibility for an IRC often occurs after students complete a respective secondary CTE program of study their conferral requires an independent assessment of skills and knowledge by the certifying business industry or state entity.

That external involvement by industry is meant to signal to prospective employers that an applicant has acquired at least some skills required for a specific position or occupation. Yet it’s unclear how well this works in practice. What little research has been done on such credentials provides grounds for concern17 as do the seemingly questionable incentives tied to them in states’ accountability systems as many of those systems prioritize quantity (number of IRCs obtained) over quality.18

To date no study has examined the impact of specific IRCs earned at the high school level on the various employment or postsecondary outcomes they are meant to improve. To address this gap this study uses data from Texas—a state that has taken an especially thoughtful approach to IRCs—to examine their impact on those outcomes and begin to assess which IRCs are making a real difference in students’ lives. Note that professional licenses such as those for accountants lawyers and nurses can also be considered IRCs but our focus is on IRCs made available to students through state K–12 policy. IRCs that require education beyond a high school diploma such as teaching or nursing licenses are excluded from the set of IRCs examined in this study. Given historical concerns about inequity in CTE the report also examines how student characteristics are associated with IRC receipt and whether IRCs truly provide an avenue to postsecondary success for historically underrepresented populations.

Specifically the study addresses the following questions:

1. What is the relationship between students’ acquisition of IRCs and their postsecondary educational and employment outcomes and does this relationship vary across demographic groups?

2. What student school and geographic factors are most strongly related to students’ likelihood of earning an IRC?

3. How many students earn IRCs across Texas and what kinds of IRCs do they earn?

4. How do students understand and perceive the value of IRCs?

State policy context

This report draws on extensive longitudinal data representing more than one million students who graduated from public high schools in Texas between 2017 and 2019. Texas is an ideal setting for this study both due to the prominence of IRCs in state policy (more below) and its large and diverse population.19 It’s a state where most students in public schools are low income and/or students of color.

Like many states Texas reimagined and expanded its CTE programs following the passage of the federal Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 (Perkins IV). Critical to this transformation was passage of House Bill 22 in 2017 which directed the Texas Education Agency (TEA) to publish a list of approved IRCs that are recognized and valued by employers and to factor students’ receipt of such IRCs into the state’s public school accountability system.20 The TEA solicited extensive feedback from employers workforce boards postsecondary education institutions and school districts to determine which credentials were most closely aligned with high-wage in-demand occupations.21 It released a preliminary list in 2016–17 and a final one in 2017–18.22 This list is revised every two years meaning that the IRCs approved in 2019–20 are in use until 2022–23.23 Students who complete any approved IRC are now considered college career and military ready (CCMR) in school accountability ratings.

Schools and districts were required to collect and report data on students’ acquisition of IRCs using the preliminary list in 2016–17. It showed that an estimated 2.7 percent of the roughly 350000 high school graduates that year—nearly 10000 students—earned an IRC before graduating and that figure has risen considerably since.24

Data and Methodology

The bulk of this report uses Texas’s statewide longitudinal data system from the Texas Education Research Center which includes individual-level data on nearly every public school student public and private college enrollee and employee in Texas. The study sample comprises more than one million students who graduated from a public high school in Texas during the 2016–17 2017–18 and 2018–19 school years. Of that population 5.9 percent (n = 60727) earned at least one IRC before graduating whereas 94.1 percent did not.25 Graduating cohorts in the sample are linked with information from Texas’s Unemployment Insurance (UI) wage system to determine whether they are employed their industry of employment and their earnings in the first year after graduating.26 State-level data from Massachusetts are also included in Appendix B to help contextualize the Texas results with those from another state.

To address questions about the rates of IRC acquisition and factors associated with them the analysis uses descriptive statistics to identify the most common IRCs and certification subjects examine the relationship between IRC receipt and CTE course taking and explore how IRC receipt varies across student populations. Multilevel logistic regression models are used to estimate which student characteristics most strongly predict IRC receipt and calculate how much IRC receipt varies across schools districts and broad geographic regions.27

To examine the relationship between acquisition of IRCs and outcomes the study uses regression models that control for the specific high schools that students graduated from and methods that match IRC recipients to a demographically and academically equivalent sample of IRC nonrecipients28 and compare results between matched groups. Data show whether students earned an IRC and what type they earned as well as whether they concentrated in a CTE field and if so whether the certification is in that same field. Data on the share of students who complete a coherent CTE sequence of increasingly sophisticated courses is also used for some of the school- level analysis.

Postsecondary education outcomes include college enrollment (two- and four-year institutions) and persistence (continued enrollment in the second year). Labor outcomes include employment within the first twelve months after graduating high school industry of employment and first- year earnings.29 Finally a “postsecondary-success” measure gauges whether a student enrolled in college or earned a decent income which is set at 200 percent of the federal poverty line ($25760) after high school.

To further contextualize the results interviews and focus groups were conducted with a dozen high school students in Texas. The conversations probed students’ views of their CTE courses and programs how they learned about IRCs and their experiences earning them and their perceptions of the value of both CTE courses and the IRCs they earned or planned to earn. Accounts from the focus groups are embedded throughout the report using pseudonyms to ensure anonymity and appear under the heading “student voice.” For more information on the methods used in this report see Appendix A.

Limitations

Although statistical models control for a broad swathe of student and school characteristics the estimated effects of earning an IRC on future outcomes may be biased upwards. That’s because schools that provide students with greater opportunities to earn IRCs may be different than schools that do not in ways that cannot be captured in the data—plus student selection into IRC-granting programs may be correlated with characteristics such as student motivation which our rich set of control variables may not reflect. Both factors could result in the estimates being larger than the true effect of earning an IRC on postsecondary education and employment outcomes so the results should be interpreted cautiously.

Findings

How do IRCs shape students' short-term employment and educational outcomes?

Section Summary This section examines how IRCs relate to individual students’ experiences in the labor market immediately upon graduating from high school.30 The relationship between IRC receipt and students’ short-term employment and educational outcomes is mostly positive or neutral. IRC receipt is modestly but positively associated with overall college enrollment four-year college enrollment and college persistence but this result is largely explained by the fact that the most common IRCs (Health Science and business) are positively linked to college outcomes while several less common IRCs are inversely related. Regarding short-term workforce outcomes a number of IRCs have a strong positive relationship with earnings and the benefits of IRCs appear unaffected by one’s race ethnicity gender or class background. Note however that while IRCs are positively associated with earnings nearly all employed individuals are earning less than a living wage the year after graduating. When examining postsecondary success more comprehensively (i.e. including both workforce and educational outcomes) we see that IRCs in Information Technology Health Science and business have the best outcomes for students. Taken together the results imply that earning certain IRCs may be an effective strategy for improving students’ educational and earnings prospects but many serve more as a stepping- stone to future career development rather than as a direct path to financial independence right out of high school.

Finding 1: In general IRCs are weakly related to increases in short-term employment while a few specific IRCs are positively related to increases in short-term earnings—particularly for students not attending college and part-time college students.

Table 1 shows how students’ short-term employment rates and median annual wages vary based on the IRC earned in high school. The first two columns include individuals who do not attend college the next two include college students and the final two include the full sample. For all samples median earnings vary considerably across IRC fields with the highest-earning group (Transportation) earning twice the amount of the lowest earning group (Arts and A/V).

Unsurprisingly if paradoxically IRC fields where students have lower college-enrollment rates show better employment outcomes—because few college students are working full time. For instance Architecture and Construction ($9576 median earnings) Education ($10875) Cosmetology ($9091) Manufacturing ($9607) and Transportation ($11667) have the highest median earnings and tend to have the lowest college enrollment rates. For all those IRC fields apart from Cosmetology students earn at least 50 percent more compared to students who did not earn any IRC in high school. However the employment rates are only modestly higher for those fields compared to students with no IRC (no more than eight percentage points). Conversely IRC fields for which students had high college enrollment rates such as Business Health Science and Information Technology tend to have employment outcomes worse than or equivalent to students who did not earn any IRC.

Critically median earnings were close to or below the poverty line for all individuals irrespective of whether they earned an IRC in high school or the field in which they earned the IRC. Even for students who did not go to college after high school 75 percent of them made less than approximately $15300 in their first year after graduating and even among students who did not enroll in college fewer than 5 percent earned at least $30000 their first year out of high school (not shown in the table below).

Table 1. IRC fields with lower college enrollment tend to have better employment outcomes.

Note. Author’s calculations are based on Texas administrative data covering all 1034882 high school graduates in the state from 2017 through 2019 for calculations of employment and within the first year of graduating high school for calculations of earnings. Earnings are for part-time and full-time workers.

Student voice: The process of obtaining an IRC The primary logic of IRCs is that they provide to employers a clear signal of students’ knowledge and skills that are aligned to workforce needs. But students frequently described how the culture of CTE programs and the process of preparing for and earning IRCs promoted their readiness for careers and made it clear who took the program seriously. Brianna: [Our teacher] really puts us to work and I don’t know it’s just learning in the book and then doing it yourself. I feel like it gets stuck in my head. I like that. But I feel it’s a really great experience. Mia: I also feel like you mature very well in the program…. You have to learn what it’s [like] to be an adult in the program because you’re looking for your future. This is your future. I feel like people take it seriously and I absolutely adore that. Lexi: Freshman year you have to have 100 hours. If you don’t you’re dropped. Sophomore year you have to have about 520. If you don’t you’re dropped. Senior year you have to have about 1000…. If you don’t get your hours you don’t continue in the course. If you don’t get your hours by the time school’s over you have to pay to go finish your hours at a private institution or you just don’t get your license at all. So it’s definitely all up to you. Gracie: I could really see my skills with [floral] design getting better over time. I was also able to see my classmates and their skill sets grow so we were able to collaborate and you know learn from each other so it was just a really good group learning experience and it was great to see how our skill sets advanced over time. Morgan: Our [first-year] teacher left after Covid so freshman year we had one teacher sophomore year we started with a new teacher and . . . the first day we went headfirst into projects and stuff and I feel like that I’ve already gotten ten times better with the tools and just the one and a half years compared to the whole year of bookwork. Lexi and Kaitlin: [Lexi] I had to babysit [the freshmen] yesterday. They were middle schoolers three months before they came to high school. That’s the problem with freshman being in cosmetology. [Kaitlin] I feel a lot of [freshmen] . . . don’t really take the class seriously. They’re like “Oh I get to play with makeup for an hour.” So it’s a lot of people that join freshman year and they take the opportunity away from people that want to do this for real. [Lexi] Also a lot of them drop out too because they’re like “Oh I actually have to do something. [Kaitlin] I mean kids drop out every year…. They talked about scrubs at least five girls dropped the class before we even started dressing [mannequins].”

Although the results in Table 1 suggest variation in employment and earnings across IRC categories and IRC nonrecipients many of these differences disappear once controls are added. Specifically after CTE coursework and student characteristics have been accounted for31 few IRC fields show either a positive or negative relationship to students’ employment prospects.32 Per Figure 1 only Health Science IRCs statistically improve employment likelihood and even then only modestly while students who earned both Arts and A/V and Cosmetology IRCs have lower likelihood of employment.

Figure 1. Few IRCs show either a positive or negative relationship with employment once college enrollment and other student characteristics are accounted for.

​ Note . Author’s calculations are based on Texas administrative data covering all 1034882 high school graduates in the state from 2017 through 2019. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals are large for education because only fifty-seven students are represented across all three years of data.

Although we find little relationship between IRC receipt and students’ immediate employment findings suggest that certifications are much more strongly and positively related to first-year earnings for students who are employed (Figure 2).33 On average receipt of an IRC is related to a roughly 9 percent increase in annual earnings for the full sample of high school graduates controlling for college enrollment (Figure 2 “Any IRC”). This estimate is relatively consistent across student samples with the largest estimated increase in earnings found for students not attending college at 12.6 percent followed by full-time college students at 9.6 percent and finally part-time college students at 8.8 percent (see Appendix A Table A6). Given that the estimated median earnings for students who did not earn an IRC and did not attend college was $8129 (see Table 1) a 12.6 percent increase in earnings translates into an additional $1024 annually.

Figure 2. A number of IRCs are positively related to earnings with cosmetology providing the largest reliable earnings benefit.

​ Note. Author’s calculations are based on Texas administrative data covering 350876 high school graduates in the state from 2017 through 2019 who were both employed and enrolled in college in their first year after graduating high school. The statistical model controls for the number of credit hours students attempted in their first year. The outcome variable is the natural logarithm of first-year earnings. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals are large for education because only thirty-one students are represented across all three years of data.

The estimated earnings increase—again measured within the first year of graduating high school—tends to be largest for either students not attending college or part-time students. For the former the largest boosts in earnings come from IRCs in Manufacturing Cosmetology and Health Science while for part-time college students the largest increases come from Cosmetology Transportation and Public Safety. Cosmetology boasts the largest estimates overall associated with an impressive 31.1 percent increase in earnings for individuals who do not enroll in college after high school 12.5 percentage points greater than the boost full-time college students receive (Figure 3). Likewise the Manufacturing IRC is associated with a 15.2 percent increase in earnings for individuals who do not go to college 12.7 percentage points greater than the small boost full-time college students receive. Again given the threat of selection bias these estimates cannot be interpreted as causal but they do suggest that IRCs have clear value for students entering the labor market after high school.

Figure 3. IRC earnings gains are generally greater for recipients who do not attend college or attend part-time than for full-time college students.

​ Note. This figure contains data for selected IRCs. Full results of these models appear in Appendix A Table A6.

Figure 4 shows by demographic group the relationship between IRC receipt and earnings among those who received an IRC in a CTE field of concentration in high school. There is remarkable consistency in the relationship between IRC receipt and earnings which is within 1 to 2 percentage points of the 9 percent increase for nearly every demographic group apart from Asian students. Put differently we find minimal differences in the relationship between IRC receipt and earnings by gender race/ethnicity economic status LEP special-education status or gifted status.

Figure 4. The relationship between IRC receipt in a field of CTE concentration and first-year earnings is remarkably consistent across demographic groups.

​ Note. Author’s calculations are based on Texas administrative data covering all 685469 high school graduates in the state from 2017 through 2019 who were employed within the first year of graduating high school. The natural logarithm of earnings was used as the outcome variable. The estimated differences are between students who earned an IRC in the same CTE subject in which they concentrated and all other students (whether they earned an IRC participated in CTE or did neither). Bars show 95 percent confidence intervals.

Finding 2: IRCs in Agriculture Business and Health Science are positively associated with college enrollment and persistence but those in Cosmetology Manufacturing and Transportation are negatively associated.

Overall receipt of any IRC is modestly but positively related to students’ early college outcomes. Estimates of the relationship between IRC receipt and college enrollment did not exceed roughly one percentage point (Figure 5).34 Yet IRC receipt is more positively correlated with college persistence (continuing for a second year of college): students who earn any IRC are about three percentage points more likely to persist. In general our findings suggest that the relationship between IRC receipt and early college outcomes is positive but modest and we find no evidence that IRC receipt deters students from college attendance on average.

Figure 5. Receipt of any IRC is modestly but positively related to college outcomes.

​ Note. Author’s calculations are based on Texas administrative data covering all 1034882 high school graduates in the state from 2017 through 2019. Bars show 95 percent confidence intervals.

This positive but modest relationship is likely driven by the fact that Business and Health Science (and to a lesser degree Agriculture and Information Technology) comprise the majority of IRCs and are both positively associated with college-going and persistence compared to their peers (Figure 6).35 On the other hand students who earn IRCs in Architecture and Construction Hospitality and Tourism Cosmetology Manufacturing and Transportation have lower odds of college enrollment in general and four-year college enrollment in particular. Students who earn Hospitality and Tourism and Transportation IRCs are also less likely to persist in college.

Figure 6. Some IRCs such as Health Science and Information Technology are associated with better postsecondary education outcomes while others such as Cosmetology and Transportation are associated with worse postsecondary education outcomes.

​ Note. Author’s calculations are based on Texas administrative data covering all 1034882 high school graduates in the state from 2017 through 2019. N sizes for each IRC area in parentheses are for the two attendance outcomes. Bars show 95 percent confidence intervals.

Finding 3: Only a handful of IRCs are related to overall success beyond high school.

Up to this point results show that IRCs that are positively linked to college enrollment often provide less immediate labor market benefit while those positively linked to earnings are inversely related to college going. Put differently there appears to be a trade-off between certifications that facilitate the transition into postsecondary education and those that provide immediate labor-market value which leads to the question: which IRCs best promote postsecondary success overall?

In this report such success is defined as college enrollment or earning 200 percent of the poverty line for a single adult ($25760).36 Figure 7 shows that after controlling for subject-specific CTE coursework and other student factors just four IRCs (Information Technology Health Science Business and Arts and A/V) meet that definition for student success while the Cosmetology IRC generally reduces students’ chances of hitting this mark (the Education IRC has too few students for a reliable estimate).

Recall that previous analyses suggested that Cosmetology IRCs were most strongly associated with increases in first-year earnings. Nevertheless the combination of extremely low rates of college enrollment among Cosmetology IRC recipients and the fact that few students in the sample earn more than the income threshold results in a negative link between Cosmetology IRCs and postsecondary success.

Finally when looking just at the effects of CTE-aligned IRCs—meaning students have concentrated in a CTE cluster and have earned an IRC in the same subject area—we find that completing this coursework and receiving an IRC is estimated to significantly improve students’ odds of postsecondary success overall (see Table A7 in Appendix A for full data).

Figure 7. A number of IRCs are modestly but significantly related to overall postsecondary success.

​ Note. Author’s calculations are based on Texas administrative data covering all 1034882 high school graduates in the state from 2017 through 2019. The outcomes are odds ratios of postsecondary success which is defined as college enrollment or earning 200 percent of the poverty line for a single adult ($25760) between IRC recipients and nonrecipients. CTE-aligned IRCs are those for which students have concentrated in a CTE cluster and have earned an IRC in the same subject area. Bars show 95 percent confidence intervals.

How do IRCs shape student trajectories?

Section Summary The connection between IRC receipt and students’ choice of college major and industry of employment are not tightly aligned suggesting that the vast majority of students will go on to work or study outside of their IRC field. This suggests that IRCs may have educational value even if students pursue fields other than the one related to it but opportunities clearly exist to better align CTE pathways at the K–12 level with postsecondary education programs to pave transitions into college.

Finding 4: The majority of students who earn IRCs are not employed in the industry most closely aligned with their credentials (if they enter the workforce) nor are they enrolled in related college majors (if they go to college).

Figure 8 shows whether students who earned an IRC in a specific subject later selected a college major that was aligned to it.37 The sample is restricted to students who enrolled in college their first year after high school. Two points are noteworthy. First students are more likely to pursue majors outside of their IRC subject except for a few fields that drive the overall positive correlation between alignment of IRC receipt and college major. For example 38 percent of Public Safety IRC recipients majored in the field in college whereas just 12 percent of other students majored in Public Safety (latter not shown). Likewise 31 percent of students who earned Health Science IRCs in high school majored in Health Science compared to 8 percent of non-IRC recipients who pursued those same majors; the comparable figures for Information Technology IRC and non-IRC recipients is 30 and 3 percent respectively.

Clearly some IRCs are more tightly aligned with what students major in college. Whereas more than one-third of Public Safety38 IRC recipients are pursuing majors related to the subject of their certification that rate is less than 20 percent for the majority of IRC categories and less than 5 percent for two categories (Architecture and Construction and Cosmetology). Across the full sample less than one-quarter (23 percent) of all IRC recipients who enrolled in college after high school are majoring in the same subject in which they earned their certification (not shown).

Second for all IRC subjects except for Health Science and Information Technology the most popular major is Liberal Arts and Sciences. This major includes a curriculum that meets most (if not all) lower-division requirements for any two- or four-year program of study across public institutions in Texas and is most commonly pursued by two-year students seeking to transfer to a four-year university. It is difficult to say definitively whether this is a good or a bad thing; hence Figure 8 presents this major separately from the “aligned” and “misaligned” categories of majors. On one hand it shows that students earning IRCs in high school are not solely diverted into technical programs and are still quite likely to pursue traditional academic pathways once they get to higher education. On the other hand there is clearly plenty of room for improvement in helping students align the IRCs they earn in high school with their future postsecondary pathways.

Figure 8. Students are more likely to pursue majors outside of their IRC area although Public Safety Health Science and Information Technology students are relatively likely to major in their field after beginning college.

​ Note. Author’s calculations are based on Texas administrative data covering all 34875 high school graduates who completed IRCs in the state from 2017 through 2019 and enrolled in college within the first year after graduating high school. Majors were coded using the National Center for Education Statistics’ Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes specifically the two-digit CIP codes that indicate the broad major area. Cosmetology majors were considered to have enrolled in an aligned major if their major CIP code was equal to “Personal and Culinary Services” which includes majors for cosmetology programs.

Recall that previous findings suggest that IRCs are not strongly related to students’ likelihood of being employed but are positively linked to earnings among students who work after high school regardless of their demographic background or college-enrollment status. Next we investigate the relationship between IRC receipt and the industry in which students are employed. Ideally the analysis would determine whether students are working in a job or occupation aligned with their certification but Texas wage data do not allow such fine-grained investigation. So we categorize industries based on NAICS codes which group all employers into one of twenty broad industry areas (see Appendix A Table A8 for a crosswalk of how IRC fields and NAICS codes align).

Results show that in all IRC areas no more than one-quarter of employed students are working in an aligned industry (Figure 9). Compared to students who did not earn an IRC those who received one in Cosmetology Health Science Agriculture Manufacturing or Architecture and Construction are considerably more likely to be employed in the respective industries. For the remaining IRC fields fewer than 5 percent of employees are working in an aligned industry including in Arts and A/V Transportation Public Safety Information Technology Business and Hospitality and Tourism. The majority of recent high school graduates are employed in either the Accommodation and Food Services or Retail Trade industries which provide many entry-level jobs for early career workers.

Figure 9. There is a modest relationship between IRC field and industry of employment although employment in Accommodation and Food Services and Retail is most common for all IRC earners.

​ Note. Author’s calculations are based on Texas administrative data covering all 685469 high school graduates in the state from 2017 through 2019 who were employed within the first year of graduating high school. To see a list of aligned industries to each of the eleven IRC areas see Table A8 in Appendix A. “Retail Trade and Accommodation and Food Services” industries are kept separate given how common it is for recent high school graduates to be employed in these sectors but note that the latter category could overlap with “Hospitality and Tourism.” Of employed students who do not earn any IRCs 34.1 percent work in Accommodation and Food Services and 27.6 percent work in Retail Trade.

Student voice: Using IRCs for college or for life Overall students had fairly clear ideas about how their CTE program and the IRCs they could earn would prepare them for future careers and many indicated their intention to pursue a career directly aligned with their certification. Eva: My plan is I’m not going to college. I mean once I have my [cosmetology] license I’m ready to find a salon and go get into it. But I thought about doing extra schooling because I’ve always liked the spa environment. I thought that getting my estheticians license would be nice or like working in a med spa where they do like injections and stuff. I need to do extra schooling for that but I would get a lot more money. So I thought about that but I mean directly after high school I’m just going to try and do nails or something. Gracie: I have fully decided to go into the veterinary field. I recently applied to [a university]. I got accepted in the fall and I will be starting preveterinary medicine… For a while I wasn’t entirely sure if I wanted to be an actual vet or if I wanted to be a vet tech so for a while the plan was to start out at [a community college] in their associates of veterinary technology and then to transfer to get a bachelor’s but I started to learn more about the salary for vet tech and what their job looks like as well as you know college debt and all that and I realized that if I went that route I wouldn’t really make enough money to be able to pay myself out of college. And I realized a more fulfilling career for me personally would be just going for the full vet certification. However other students were clearly intent on pursuing a different career path than the focus of their CTE program and/or certification even though they spoke of the value of the preparation. Ricardo: I can definitely appreciate that we can have we have that ability to see the future career paths [related to the construction technology program] and because yeah you can totally go from this program into the workforce and then work your way up the chain. But I yeah I wouldn’t say that I would be wanting to go into [construction technology] particularly. Salma: I’m planning to go to college . . . hopefully to study veterinary. For automotive I just I kind of got in it because I wanted to learn the basics and everything. So because all the basic stuff that you can do at a shop I can technically do at home or if I have to help. So it doesn’t cost me money and everything like that. Morgan: That’s kind of why I did the construction thing. I mean I want to go into maybe the real estate field so I can definitely use construction if you’re flipping houses or whatever. It’s just a good skill to know. But then even if I don’t go into real estate or go into that construction field or anything construction related it’s still just a good skill to be able to fix something at your house.

How popular are IRCs?

Section Summary Overall IRCs are becoming increasingly widespread and certain student populations are more likely to earn IRCs compared to their peers: CTE concentrators as well as Hispanic and Asian economically disadvantaged and high-achieving students. But variance across schools far outweighs the combined predictive effect of all the analyzed student characteristics.

Finding 5: CTE concentrators as well as Hispanic Asian and higher-achieving students are most likely to earn IRCs while schools (not students’ race/ethnicity or socioeconomic background) are the most important predictor of earning an IRC.39

Findings show that there is a strong relationship between CTE course taking and IRC receipt. Figure 10 highlights the relationship between the IRCs that students earned and the CTE subject in which they did or did not concentrate (defined as earning three or more credits in the same CTE subject). Each bar represents the group of students who earned an IRC in that subject with dark blue showing the percentage of students who concentrated in the same CTE area as the subject of their certification coral showing the percentage who concentrated in a different CTE area and teal showing the percentage with no CTE concentration. In the Health Science Cosmetology and Agriculture fields more than half of students concentrated in the same CTE area as their IRC including more than three quarters of students in Health Science. In contrast in the fields of Information Technology Hospitality Architecture and Construction Manufacturing and Business nearly a third to almost half of students who earned the respective certification concentrated in a different CTE field (with the remainder not concentrating at all).40 This may seem odd but fields vary in how closely aligned their IRCs are with CTE coursework. For example they are tightly coupled in fields like Cosmetology and Health Science but much more loosely related in fields such as Business Manufacturing and Transportation.41

Figure 10. There is a strong relationship between IRCs and CTE fields for many certifications but not all of them.

​ Note. Author’s calculations are based on Texas administrative data covering the 60727 high school graduates in the state who earned at least one IRC in the respective certification field from 2017 through 2019.

Figure 11 shows how IRC rates vary across racial/ethnic gender economic and special-education populations. The results by race/ethnicity highlight the diversity in certification rates across student groups: Black students have the lowest rate of earning certifications (3.4 percent) while Hispanic students have the highest rate (6.9 percent). Native American (5.2 percent) and White (5.3 percent) students have nearly equivalent rates that are closer to the statewide average for the three cohorts (5.9 percent). There is almost no difference between male and female students in their likelihood of earning an IRC (5.8 percent vs. 5.9 percent) and economically disadvantaged students are only marginally more likely to earn a certification compared to nondisadvantaged students (6.1 percent vs. 5.3 percent). However special-education students are considerably less likely to receive an IRC compared to students who were not receiving special-education services (3.5 percent vs. 6.1 percent).42

Figure 11. Race/ethnicity and special-education status more strongly relate to IRC rates than gender or economic status.

​ Note. Author’s calculations are based on Texas administrative data covering all 1034882 high school graduates in the state from 2017 through 2019.

Variation in IRC receipt rates across demographic groups is somewhat greater when considering the certification area (Table 2). For example at .17 percent Asian students are the least likely to earn IRCs in Architecture and Construction but most likely to receive them in Health Science (nearly 4 percent).43 In contrast Hispanic students are the most likely to earn IRCs in Architecture and Construction Public Safety and Transportation. Native American students are close to the average for most areas but have the highest rates of earning Information Technology IRCs (.24 percent). Pacific Islander students have below-average rates of certifications for all areas apart from Arts and A/V. White students are most likely to earn Agriculture certifications (.35 percent) but are close to the statewide average for most other areas. Black students have below-average certification rates in all subjects.

Table 2. Health Science and Business IRCs are the most popular for all student groups but there is some variation among ethnic/racial student subgroups.

Somewhat surprisingly we find that IRC recipients are considerably higher achieving than nonrecipients on average. Figure 12 presents students’ mean performance on state standardized tests in four subject areas (Algebra I U.S. History Biology and English II) by whether students earned any certification. The difference between IRC recipients and nonrecipients ranges from roughly one-eighth of a standard deviation (English) to one-fifth of a standard deviation (Algebra I).44

Figure 12. Students who earn IRCs are considerably higher achieving than their comparable peers.

​ Note. Author’s calculations are based on Texas administrative data covering all 1034882 high school graduates in the state from 2017 through 2019. High school assessments include the Algebra I End-of-Course Exam (EOC) Biology EOC English II EOC and U.S. History EOC.

Whereas IRC recipients are higher achieving on average compared to nonrecipients this pattern varies markedly across IRCs. Figure 13 shows that students who received certifications in Arts and A/V Information Technology Business Health Science and Agriculture scored considerably higher (at least 0.25 standard deviations above the statewide average) on tested subjects at times 0.40–0.50 standard deviations higher than their peers who did not earn IRCs. For context the national Black-White test-score disparity is estimated to range from roughly 0.50–0.80 standard deviations depending on the specific grade level assessment and subject45 suggesting that the test-score advantage is substantial for students who earned certain IRCs. In contrast students who earned certifications in Education Architecture and Construction Cosmetology and Transportation tended to score below average on standardized test scores (from 0.10 to 0.28 standard deviations). Once we control for students’ CTE coursework and other student characteristics we tend to find positive relationships between test scores and essentially all IRC subjects (see Appendix A Table A3 ). This suggests lower-achieving students may be more likely to pursue specific CTE programs but among CTE participants IRC recipients are higher achieving.

Figure 13. Student achievement varies markedly across IRC fields.

​ Note. Author’s calculations are based on Texas administrative data covering all 1034882 high school graduates in the state from 2017 through 2019. Test scores are an average of the high school Algebra I EOC Biology EOC English II EOC and U.S. History EOC.

So far we have examined how students’ demographic and academic characteristics relate to their likelihood of earning an IRC. As it turns out what matters even more is which schools they attend. The substantial variation in IRC rates across high schools is highlighted in Figure 14. In many Texas public schools not one student earned an IRC in any of the three years analyzed and the median IRC rate (or the percentage of high school graduates who earned an IRC) for all schools was just 1.3 percent. In contrast the top 1 percent of high schools (roughly twenty of them) had an IRC rate greater than 30 percent and nearly two-thirds of the students who graduated from the one high school with the highest IRC rate in Texas completed a certification before graduating (we examine the role of school type below). Across all IRC categories schools explain 65 to 75 percent of the variation in students’ likelihood of earning a certification.46 For context studies using nationally representative samples of students estimate that schools explain roughly 15 to 25 percent of the variation in standardized test scores.47

Figure 14. Zero students earned an IRC at more than 40 percent of Texas high schools but nearly two-thirds earned an IRC at the school with the highest rate.

​ Note. Author’s calculations are based on Texas administrative data covering all 1941 Texas public high schools with at least five high school graduates combined between 2017 and 2019. The percentage of high school graduates who earned an IRC between 2017 and 2019 was calculated for each high school in the sample.

Student voice: Advocating for themselves Because CTE programs and the opportunity to earn IRCs vary so much across schools some students decide to transfer high schools to participate in a CTE program of interest. In the passage below one student describes her experience transferring from Sam High School (SHS) a relatively affluent school offering many Advanced Placement and honors courses to Davy High School (DHS) a less affluent Early College High School (ECHS) with well-known CTE programs particularly in Automotive Technology and Construction.

SHS doesn’t tell us about programs that don’t get you to college. So we saw [Cosmetology] on our choice sheet and we talked to our counselors and they were like “No nobody’s really been in that program for years because they don’t bus people over to DHS.” So we really had to try to get into the program and contact DHS…. Being from SHS we didn’t have any contact with the teachers. We had to go through administration to even get us into the program.

The particular school that students attend clearly matters to whether they earn IRCs but why they matter is less clear. Figure 15 groups all high schools into one of five quintiles based on their IRC rate and compares the demographic characteristics of schools across them.48 While the IRC completion and CTE concentration rates vary markedly across schools their demographic characteristics are similar. In more sophisticated statistical models (see Appendix A ) school variables such as size demographics and average test scores are only weakly related to students’ probability of earning an IRC.49

Figure 15. There is little demographic variation across five quintiles of schools based on their IRC rate.

​ Note. Author’s calculations are based on data from the TEA’s Texas Academic Performance Reports (TAPR) covering all 1786 high schools included in the 2021 TAPR reports for the 2019–20 academic year. “Students of color” refers to Black Hispanic Native American Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander and multiracial students.

Finally Figure 16 examines whether the school-level rates of IRC receipt and the completion of a coherent CTE sequence—one that typically includes increasingly rigorous courses50—vary relative to whether the school has adopted one of three Texas College and Career Readiness School Models (CCRSM)51 including the following:

Early College High School (ECHS)

Pathways in technology early college high schools (P-TECH)

Texas science technology engineering and mathematics (T-STEM) academies

The IRC rate for all school models investigated (including not having a CCRSM model) is roughly 11–13 percent and schools that have adopted multiple CCRSM models have a rate of 16 percent. T-STEM academies have CTE sequence-completion rates considerably higher than non-CCRSM schools (77.6 percent vs. 58.8 percent) but ECHS and P-TECH schools actually have lower rates compared to non-CCRSM schools. Overall while schools appear to be the most important factor in affecting students’ likelihood of earning an IRC neither the demographic characteristics of the school nor the school’s adopted reform model relate strongly to the school-level IRC rate.52 We explore this finding further in the discussion section.

Figure 16: IRC rates are only slightly higher in high schools with specific school models designed to prepare students for college and career.

​ Note. CCRSM = College and Career Readiness School Models; ECHS = Early College High School; P-TECH = Pathways in Technology Early College Schools; T-STEM = Texas Science Technology Engineering and Math Academies.

The rate of students earning IRCs is growing in Texas. In 2017 only 2.7 percent of Texas high school graduates were recorded as having earned an IRC before graduating high school (Figure 17). This rate climbed to 4.8 percent in 2018 and more than doubled to 9.9 percent for the 2019 cohort of graduates. This considerable rise likely reflects not only an actual increase in students earning IRCs but also the expanded list of IRCs approved for funding and accountability purposes by state authorities and growing district capacity to accurately capture and report on the IRCs that students are earning (see “State policy context”).

Figure 17. The rate of high school graduates earning IRCs roughly doubled each year between 2017 and 2019

​ Note. Author’s calculations are based on Texas administrative data covering all 1034882 high school graduates in the state from 2017 through 2019 and show the percentage who earned at least one IRC.​

Finding 6: Health Science Business and Manufacturing dominate the top twenty-five most common IRCs.

Figure 18 shows the rates at which students complete different types of certifications categorized by the CTE cluster to which they are most closely aligned. The categories are mutually exclusive with students who earned certifications in more than one CTE area included in the “multiple” group. As shown Health Science is the most popular IRC area with roughly 1.6 percent of the sample earning an IRC in this area more than the combined total of the seven CTE areas with the lowest rates of IRC receipt. Business and Manufacturing are the two next most common with rates of 1.1 percent and 0.8 percent respectively. Less than half of one percent of students earn all other categories of IRCs. Approximately 0.3 percent of high school graduates earned certifications from two or more different CTE clusters. Because only fifty-seven students across all three cohorts earned an IRC in the area of Education (mainly the Educational Aide certification) it is excluded from many of the prior analyses of student outcomes.

Figure 18: Health Science is the most common IRC field followed by Business with less than half of one percent of students earning IRCs in all other categories.

​ Note. Author’s calculations are based on Texas administrative data covering all 1034882 high school graduates in the state from 2017 through 2019 and show the percentage who earned at least one IRC in each certification. Just 57 students earned IRCs in Education over the three graduating cohorts and that figure rounds to 0.0%.

Student voice: Awareness of IRCs is uneven All students who participated in focus groups were aware of the existence of certification exams related to their CTE programs but they had varied levels of understanding of how to earn IRCs and the importance of doing so. Cosmetology students described the process with a high degree of precision including the number of practical hours needed to be completed each year in order to continue in the program the name of the state agency that regulates cosmetology licensing the name of the third-party vendor that administers the exam and the content of the exam. Students in other programs seemed far less certain of the process and benefits of obtaining an IRC. For instance when asked about how she learned about the opportunity to earn a safety certification in the automotive technology program one student stated she “hadn’t heard anything about it.” Another student recalled: He [teacher] made us do the hands on—not the hands on!—the computer work. Then at the very end [of the work] he said that if we finish all of this we’ll get a certificate but to do it slowly and actually remember it because he’s going to test us on this. In general students in programs other than Cosmetology could not recall in detail what certification they could earn or how they could earn it. Obviously this underscores the need to ensure that educators are informing students of opportunities to earn IRCs while they complete CTE programs and effectively preparing them to pass certifying exams.

Table 3 shows the twenty-five IRCs with the largest number of students earning them across the three high school graduate cohorts. The Certified Nurse Aide/Assistant is the most popular IRC with 7354 students earning the certification; five other Health Science IRCs also make the list of the top twenty-five. Business IRCs are the next most popular with all but one (i.e. QuickBooks) relating to certifications in Microsoft Office (see Appendix B for similar patterns in Massachusetts). Many of these popular IRCs are not highly technical and can be earned early in a CTE program. While Table 3 includes only twenty-five out of the hundreds of IRCs that students can hypothetically earn to be considered “college and career ready” by state policy it comprises 60184 of the 77426 IRCs actually awarded (77.7 percent) during high school in Texas during the three years examined here. In contrast the hundred least-popular IRCs all had fewer than seventy students earn them across the three cohorts.

Implications

Clearly this first-of-its-kind study is not the final word on the value of IRCs earned during high school—particularly because we were only able to follow students’ education and workforce outcomes for the first year after their graduation from high school. Yet there is much worth contemplating herein about how industry-recognized credentials influence student outcomes. Below are four implications that merit attention.

First IRCs earned while in high school are mostly a positive for the students who earn them but they are far from transformational.

Students who earn IRCs during high school tend to have somewhat better work and college outcomes including higher employment rates more income and higher rates of college enrollment and persistence. A few IRCs—including Cosmetology Transportation and Health Science—appear to boost earnings and employment considerably particularly for students not attending college and part-time college students. Getting an IRC in Health Science or Business is positively associated with both college going and persistence. In general the largest impacts materialize for students who both concentrate in and earn an IRC in the same field suggesting that high schools should help students figure out their interests and aptitudes early enough for them to demonstrate mastery of valuable workplace skills. Mastery after all is what an IRC signifies.

All in all there’s good evidence that the opportunity to earn an IRC represents an important option for high school students particularly those who plan to study CTE courses anyway.

Yet it doesn’t appear that IRCs are transformational for most students. While positive the differences in work and postsecondary educational outcomes for students with and without particular IRCs are generally small and for most IRCs they’re negligible. For example IRC recipients in Manufacturing Hospitality and Architecture and Construction don’t strongly outperform non-IRC students on any of the outcomes analyzed. Also not realized is the (perhaps unrealistic) expectation that high school students will earn credentials that launch them immediately into good jobs or rigorous postsecondary experiences that build on the skills they’ve acquired. Indeed most college students who have earned high school IRCs enroll in majors or take jobs unrelated to their credentials.53

That said high school IRCs are best understood as tickets into entry-level positions in today’s technical job market. They should also make for increased job opportunities and advancement in a chosen career path. Their value is likely not fully recognized until students complete other relevant courses apprenticeships and on-the-job experiences that span both high school and what comes after it. All that is to say IRCs earned during high school may (and perhaps should) become part of a “stack” of credentials experiences and competencies that students build over a longer postgraduation period than we were able to study for this report.

In other words we should keep in mind that—even at their most effective—IRCs earned by high school students are a stepping stone not an endpoint.

Second career and technical programs that lead to IRCs do not constitute a lower educational “track.”

An enduring concern has been that career-focused programs in high school—reminiscent of old-fashioned “voc-ed”—serve to “track” lower-performing students into less rigorous programs thereby limiting opportunity and perpetuating social inequality. At least when it comes to programs terminating in IRCs this study finds such concerns misplaced. Students of all types including those who are above-average achievers go on to earn IRCs. In fact on average students who earn IRCs are slightly higher achieving than those who don’t a reversal of the negative stereotype from earlier days.

We observe that Hispanic students are more likely to earn IRCs than any other racial/ethnic group while Black students are least likely. This striking discontinuity among students of color could have important equity ramifications and should be investigated further. It’s possible that Black students (or their families) still view CTE courses and industry credentials through the old “lower- track” lens.

Third when it comes to getting students on the path toward an IRC the choice of high school matters.

The school that students attend—not their racial or socioeconomic background—is the most powerful predictor of whether they will concentrate in CTE or earn an IRC. Although this report cannot definitively answer why some schools help students to earn IRCs at high rates we do know that they are neither CTE focused nor disproportionately attended by lower-income or minority students. In fact the proportion of students earning IRCs at Texas’s P-TECH schools which have a CTE focus is only slightly higher than for students enrolled in academically focused “early college” high schools or typical nonspecialized high schools.

Still in speculating why certain schools might influence a student’s likelihood of obtaining an IRC several factors could play a role. Texas’s inclusion of IRCs in its state accountability system helps explain in part the surge in IRCs awarded in recent years in the Lone Star State. Likewise how IRCs factor into a district’s graduation requirements and school accountability ratings is key as is whether the district or school covers the substantial costs of sitting for an IRC exam. The quality of CTE teachers surely matters too including whether they can serve as ambassadors for the program and for the benefits of obtaining an IRC in particular. And school size likely also makes a difference. Texas for instance has many small rural high schools.

Finally students pursue IRCs for a number of reasons some of which have little to do with their career plans.

The fact that most students are not employed in the industry or enrolled in the college major most aligned to their high school IRC plus responses from students in focus groups suggest that their reasons for pursuing IRCs vary including the following:

They have a personal interest in the topic

They want to get a specialized skill that will lead to a job out of high school

They want to acquire more general workplace skills (e.g. particular software programs) or general life skills

They are in the sorting and self-selecting stage perhaps deciding what they don’t want to do after graduation or in later years

Focus-group participants often discussed these more practical functions. Participants believed that the classes required to earn IRCs provided them with benefits not necessarily related to the labor market including engaging them in their studies and offering useful life skills. One student in the construction program for instance planned to go into real estate and thought learning construction could help him flip houses on the side. Another student in that program loved working with his hands but planned to pursue a white-collar career since his father told him to find a job where he didn’t have to be exposed to the elements all day. A student in the automotive technology program planned to go to veterinary school but hailing from a family of mechanics never wanted to pay someone else to fix her car. And a cosmetology student appreciated the collaborative culture of her program and the care she felt from her teachers but simply hated cutting hair; she was mulling her next move.

Certainly students can enjoy taking CTE classes and reap these ancillary benefits without having to earn an IRC. Still knowing that some students pursue IRC-granting programs with no intention of building upon the certification in college or career raises the question of whether IRC policies are missing the mark. If we see them only as a catalyst for a budding industry interest in high school that must lead to advanced same-industry know-how in adulthood we are likely to be disappointed with what they can achieve.

Yet our emphasis on IRCs improving students’ postsecondary outcomes may blind us to the value that they provide students in other ways. A reasonable goal should be not only to sharpen and improve how CTE and IRC opportunities are valued in the labor market but also to better understand how students perceive them in real time and in real life. Realizing that these programs are serving different functions for different students at different times will help us to develop them far better than we have to date.

Can sophisticated software help move more electricity across our existing power grids? The evidence from computer models and real-world tests suggests it can. Now it’s up to utilities grid operators and regulators to put it to work at scale.

This is the second installment of our series on technologies that can expand the capacity and improve the efficiency of transmission grids known as grid-enhancing technologies or GETs. In our first installment we covered dynamic line-rating systems that use sensors and analytics to determine how much electricity transmission lines can actually carry from one point to the other. In this piece we’ll dive into new software that can give grid operators the insight they need to use their existing transmission networks far more effectively. Let’s call it transmission-optimization software.

Over the past five or six years these software platforms have begun to prove their capability to unlock more grid capacity by solving hyper-complex equations to discover the optimal configuration of existing transmission networks. In fact in a handful of locations in the U.S. they’re already solving real-world power-flow congestion problems leading to major savings for grid operators.

That’s not an easy thing to do given the innate complexity of how transmission grids work. The U.S. transmission grid network is an incredibly complicated machine a network of hundreds of thousands of miles of high-voltage lines interconnected by tens of thousands of substations transformers circuit breakers switches and control systems keeping terawatts of electricity flowing at the speed of light. Understanding how changes at one point in this network affect the flows of power across the rest of the network is a demanding and computation-intensive process.

Before we get into the nuts and bolts of the new class of transmission-optimization software systems being developed to solve these intensely complex grid-modeling challenges let’s discuss their predecessors which are still heavily used by grid operators around the U.S. These are transmission-planning and -analysis software platforms from major corporate players such as Siemens’ PSS®E and General Electric’s PSLF. These software platforms have been built up over decades by experts in power flow dynamics network topology special protection schemes (for operating the grid in extreme conditions) and other such esoteric fields.

“They’ve been out there forever” said Jay Caspary a vice president at consultancy Grid Strategies — and the usefulness of these legacy programs is diminishing as the complexity of the grid is increasing.

Caspary the former head of engineering and transmission development at U.S. grid operator Southwest Power Pool has direct experience using these older software platforms to model the flows of high-voltage power across an increasingly dynamic and complex grid — and running up against their limits.

Getting these legacy power-flow modeling systems to ​“solve” for the optimal way to configure and upgrade the grid to adapt to changing conditions was computationally complicated enough when it was built around central coal gas and nuclear power plants he said.

But the addition of more and more wind and solar farms whose output fluctuates with the weather has made this power-flow optimization process harder for software to solve. In fact sometimes with the conventional software platforms ​“when you shut down your coal fleet and add a bunch of wind farms into the model it may not solve” or reach a solution for how to stabilize the grid at all Caspary said.

That’s why an increasing number of grid planners and engineers are being forced to work around the inability of these legacy software platforms to discover the right combination of transmission network reconfigurations or additions of new equipment or power lines that could allow new resources to connect to the grid.

By way of example Caspary cited the work that Grid Strategies and engineers at The Brattle Group did to model how a range of grid-enhancing technologies including transmission-optimization software could reduce congestion and expand grid capacity for more wind and solar power on parts of SPP’s grid. They used one of the legacy software platforms but it couldn’t handle all of the variables they wanted to consider. The team ended up running just one hypothetical change to the grid at a time a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. ​“It was really a brute-force effort” he said.

The results of that modeling project showed that a mix of grid-enhancing technologies could double the clean energy capacity of the grids spanning Kansas and Oklahoma quickly lower electricity costs and carbon emissions and pay back their implementation costs within a year.

But for the utilities that own and operate transmission grids and the grid operators like SPP that coordinate their operations across wide swaths of the country this kind of ​“brute-force” software analysis isn’t a practical way to figure out how to put these technologies to work he said. ​“We need tools to do that to co-optimize these technologies on their own” he said. That’s where new transmission-optimization software tools will play a vital role he said.

To be sure transmission-grid optimization isn’t exactly a smoking-hot target for software developers or Silicon Valley venture capitalists. ​“These are very niche applications [with] high barriers to entry and very few customers” he said.

That’s why the handful of transmission-optimization software platforms that have emerged to solve these kinds of problems in the U.S. over the past half-decade have been long-running collaborations between university researchers and the Department of Energy’s national laboratories and ARPA-E program he said.

“You need DOE to fund that kind of stuff” Caspary said — and then some brave grid operators and utilities to try it out for their own grids first in computer simulations and then on the grid itself.

Now we’ll meet two companies developing transmission-optimization software platforms that are starting to gain traction on U.S. grids. They’re not trying to replace the power-flow modeling platforms from Siemens and GE. Instead each of these startups has developed software specifically to tackle a discrete set of problems.

NewGrid: Tapping the hidden capacity in transmission networks

NewGrid a Somerville Massachusetts–based startup was spun out of a Boston University ARPA-E project in 2015 after three years of development funded via grants from ARPA-E’s Green Electricity Network Integration program. It has since received grants from the National Science Foundation; the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center a public economic development agency; and MassVentures a private venture capital firm.

NewGrid specializes in ​“topology optimization” or how to quickly and accurately calculate the trillions of combinations of control settings that can alter the path-of-least-resistance flows of power across a transmission network. To do that NewGrid’s technology leverages the high-voltage circuit breakers deployed across transmission grids which are typically used for reliability applications such as preventing flows from disrupting or damaging equipment or causing cascading grid failures.

It’s theoretically possible to open and close these circuit breakers to allow power to flow more efficiently across the transmission network in response to ongoing changes in grid conditions. But figuring out which ones should be opened and closed has been far too complex a math problem for real-time or even day-ahead grid operations — at least until NewGrid began applying its technology to solve the immense optimization calculations involved.

“Historically the way operators have managed the network is to consider the topology of the network to be fixed and you optimize around the edges” NewGrid CTO Pablo Ruiz told me in 2020. ​“What topology optimization does is to change it from being a constraint to being something more like a variable.”

In a February report DOE states that topology optimization can ​“route power flow around congested or overloaded transmission elements” which in turn ​“increases the transfer capacity of the grid.” Simulations that have applied NewGrid’s optimization across entire grid-operator networks have shown the potential to reduce existing congestion costs by 30 to 50 percent.

“By design the optimization scope is systemwide” Ruiz said in an interview last month. For a U.S.-wide transmission network that faces rising congestion costs — from about $3.8 billion in 2016 to as much as $5 billion in 2018 and on up since then according to Grid Strategies — that’s potentially a major improvement.

Over the past few years NewGrid has been taking incremental steps to prove out this potential with projects with Southwest Power Pool Midwest grid operator Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) and Texas grid operator ERCOT. It’s also starting to offer its services to renewable energy developers facing challenges connecting new wind or solar farms to the transmission grid Ruiz said.

A 2020 report on NewGrid’s work with SPP showed how topology optimization could reconfigure its transmission network around a point in southeast Oklahoma that was subject to significant and costly congestion. SPP used the reconfiguration that NewGrid’s software discovered reducing the price of power at that congestion point from about $600 per megawatt-hour to close to the SPP average price of $25 per MWh delivering significant cost savings until a transmission reinforcement project was completed.

NewGrid’s software was able to identify a circuit breaker reconfiguration that eliminated pockets of grid congestion and high power prices in Oklahoma. (NewGrid)

NewGrid’s work with market participants in MISO territory has also yielded a money-saving solution for transmission users in that market Ruiz said. In one case while several power lines were being taken out of service NewGrid discovered a set of circuit-breaker settings that were able to reduce congestion on surrounding circuits by ​“significant” amounts he said. That included one reconfiguration that increased power flows by 56 percent compared to the solution that lacked NewGrid’s optimization.

NewGrid’s software identified three reconfigurations of transmission grids in MISO’s Midwest U.S. territory that yielded significant increases in power flow capacity. (NewGrid)

Caspary pointed out that MISO is in the midst of a ​“congestion cost reconfiguration process” that’s aimed at putting the kind of capabilities that NewGrid brings to the table to wider use.

In the meantime Ruiz said NewGrid has been expanding its work with renewable energy projects looking for ways to reduce congestion that might be forcing them to curtail how much power they’re able to supply to the grid or increase the costs of bringing more electricity to market. While he wouldn’t name the projects NewGrid is working with ​“some of them have been operational for a while and have been suffering from congestion costs that have been increasing exponentially year-over-year” he said.

Pearl Street Technologies: Solving interconnection’s hardest problems

Grid congestion isn’t just a problem for existing wind and solar farms of course. It’s also become a major barrier to interconnecting new wind and solar projects to the grid. Beyond the years-long wait times for developers trying to secure an interconnection to transmission grids one of the biggest problems facing new wind and solar projects is the expensive grid upgrades they’re being ordered to pay for to support the electricity they expect to add to the grid.

But what if grid operators could speed the process of studying what grid upgrades might be needed to allow wind and solar projects to interconnect to the grid or find solutions that cost less? Over the past year or so Pittsburgh-based startup Pearl Street Technologies has found a niche for its Suite of Unified Grid Analyses with Renewables or Sugar software platform in doing just this for grid operators and clean energy developers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvd2VyLWVuZy5jb20vY29hbC9leHBsYWluaW5nLXRoZS1kZWxheXMtb2YtdS1zLWNvYWwtcGxhbnQtcmV0aXJlbWVudHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Explaining the delays of U.S. coal plant retirements,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.power-eng.com/coal/explaining-the-delays-of-u-s-coal-plant-retirements/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvd2VyLWVuZy5jb20vY29hbC9leHBsYWluaW5nLXRoZS1kZWxheXMtb2YtdS1zLWNvYWwtcGxhbnQtcmV0aXJlbWVudHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpbmRxdWlzdG1vcnR1YXJ5LmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL2JyaWdpdHRlLXNjaHVsdHrSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brigitte Elke Schultz Obituary 2022,"Brigitte Elke Schultz

Invitational Jan. 13-14.

For two nights only 35 of the best bull riders in the world will go head-to-head against the sport’s rankest bovine athletes showcasing the ultimate showdown of man vs. beast in one of the most exciting live sporting events to witness.

During the 2023 season the PBR will celebrate the 30th anniversary since 20 cowboys broke away from the traditional rodeo with the belief that bull riding could be a standalone sport. Since their trailblazing initiative the PBR has grown into a global phenomenon awarding nearly $300 million in prize money.

The upcoming PBR Tractor Supply Co. Invitational will be the seventh event of the new individual season. Eventgoers will watch on as riders vie for early points in the race to be crowned the 2023 PBR World Champion.

In 2022 following a frustrating four-year drought a resurgent Stetson Lawrence (Williston North Dakota) went a perfect 3-for-3 to win the second premier series event of his career.

Fresh off a Top 25 effort in New York City Lawrence began his Windy City campaign with an eighth-place effort in Round 1 covering Street Fighter (C Check Bucking Bulls) for 86 points.

The Native American sensation was then unstoppable as Championship Saturday got underway.

Lawrence first brought the boisterous crowd to its feet when he won Round 2 via an 89.75-point ride aboard Bottom’s Up (TCB Ranch/K-C Bucking Bulls). With the second pick in the championship round bull draft Lawrence then opted to go head-to-head with Big Black (K-C Bucking Bulls/Joe & Nina Webb) the very bull aboard which Daylon Swearingen (Piffard New York) won the previous elite tour event in Chicago with.

Lawrence remained poised as he climbed aboard the back of the renowned animal athlete. Matching Big Black jump-for-jump Lawrence clinched the second golden finish of his career when he reached the requisite 8 for an event-best 91 points.

Defending event champion Swearingen finished the event sixth his first of 11 Top 10 finishes en route to being crowned the 2022 PBR World Champion.

Clinching the title by winning the prestigious PBR World Finals Swearingen went a torrid 26-for-60 covering 43.33% of his animal athlete opponents during his 2022 gold buckle campaign.

Swearingen earned $1697481.63 including $1394000 for his career-first PBR World Championship and World Finals event win. Swearingen 23 is now 17th in all-time money earned in PBR competition with his career earnings topping more than $2.21 million.

In recent history the Windy City event was instrumental to one rider’s campaign who etched his name in the league record books.

Marking his second consecutive victory on the premier series Jess Lockwood (Volborg Montana) won the event in Rosemont in 2019 allowing him to further his stronghold on the No. 1 rank and setting him on a path that led him to becoming the youngest two-time World Champion in league history to end the season.

Additionally Lockwood’s win in Chicago in 2019 made him the first rider since two-time PBR World Champion J.B. Mauney (Statesville North Carolina) in 2007 to win the first two events of the season.

Other past Prairie State event winners include: Austin Meier (2006) Adriano Moraes (2008) Dustin Hall (2008) Robson Palermo (2011) Billy Robinson (2013) Marco Eguchi (2014) Silvano Alves (2015) Wallace Vieira de Olivera (2016) Rubens Barbosa (2017) and Cooper Davis (2018).

The bull riding action for the PBR Tractor Supply Co. Invitational begins with Round 1 at 7:45 p.m. CT on Friday January 13 followed by Round 2 and the championship round at 6:45 p.m. CT on Saturday January 14. All competing bull riders will get on one bull each in Rounds 1-2. Following Round 2 Saturday evening the riders’ individual two-round scores will be totaled with the Top 12 advancing to the championship round for one more out and a chance at the event title.

Tickets for the two-day event go on sale Friday August 26 at 10:00 a.m. CT and start at $15 taxes and fees not included. Tickets can be purchased online at ticketmaster.com and PBR.com at the Allstate Arena Box Office or by calling PBR customer service at 1-800-732-1727.

(Reuters) - Former U.S. President Donald Trump's social media platform Truth Social will join the video-sharing company Rumble's new ad platform as its first publisher the companies said on Tuesday as the Trump venture seeks to sell ads while circumventing Big Tech firms like Google.

The announcement reflects a deepening relationship between Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) Truth Social's parent company and Rumble a Canadian video-sharing platform that caters to conservatives.

Both Rumble and TMTG are positioning themselves as alternatives to Big Tech firms; in the announcement of its new ad platform Rumble described it as competition to Google's AdSense and Ad Exchange advertising programs.

The two sides had already struck a ""technology and cloud services” deal in December that would include video and streaming for Truth Social.

Rumble had also already been working with TMTG for months in a role that was described internally as a key strategic partnership but not clearly defined to staffers according to two people with knowledge of TMTG operations.

Truth Social restored Trump's social media presence more than a year after he was banned from Twitter Inc Facebook and Alphabet Inc's YouTube following the Jan. 6 2021 U.S. Capitol riots after he was accused of posting messages inciting violence.

The platform launched in the Apple App Store on Feb. 21 and has yet to become available in the Google Play Store for Android users.

Advertising is key to TMTG's business. In a May 27 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission Digital World Acquisition Corp the blank-check firm taking TMTG public said that TMTG ""may rely on the sale of advertising services for the substantial majority of TMTG’s revenue.""

As of Aug. 23 Trump had 3.89 million followers on Truth Social compared to the more than 88 million he had on Twitter when he was banned.

Alphabet Inc launched Google Wallet in South Africa on Tuesday as the tech giant tries to gain a foothold in the country's rapidly growing digital payments space.

The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift to digital transactions and people increasingly prefer making contactless payments via their smart devices. High smartphone penetration has also helped adoption rates.

The Google Wallet app stores a consumer's credit or debit card information and allows shoppers to pay for goods by tapping their phone against a retail store's point of sale at the checkout counter.

From Tuesday cardholders of FirstRand Bank Discovery Bank Investec Standard Bank ABSA and Nedbank will be able to add their cards to Google Wallet Google said.

They will then be able to pay with their Android phones or use OS devices where contactless payments are accepted.

Last year rival Apple Inc launched its Apple Pay mobile payment system in South Africa.

A letter signed by more than 650 employees and sent this week to Google chief executive officer Sundar Pichai and other Alphabet executives calls for the inclusion of contractors in those benefits.

The petition was organized by members of the Alphabet Workers Union a labour union that’s been trying to gain traction inside the company. Google declined to comment about the petition.

In other news Walmart is expanding its abortion coverage for employees after staying largely mum on the issue following the Supreme Court ruling.

In a memo sent to employees on Friday the company said its health-care plans will now cover abortion for employees when there is a health risk to the mother in cases of rape or incest ectopic pregnancy miscarriage or lack of fetal viability.

Previously the company’s benefits plan had covered abortion only in cases “when the health of the mother would be in danger if the fetus were carried to term the fetus could not survive the birthing process or death would be imminent after birth” according to a copy of the policy viewed by The Associated Press but not confirmed by Walmart.

Donna Morris the retailer’s chief people officer said in the memo to staff that the new policy will also offer travel support for workers — as well as their dependants — seeking abortions covered under its health-care plans so they can access services that aren’t available within 100 miles of their locations.

Walmart employs nearly 1.6 million people in the U.S. In Arkansas where the company is based abortion is banned under all circumstances unless the procedure is needed to protect the life of the mother in a medical emergency. There are no exceptions for rape or incest. That means under the revised policy Walmart employees can travel out of the state — or any other state that bans abortion for rape and incest — to obtain the procedure through the retailer’s health plans.

Several companies — including American Express Co. the Bank of America Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. — have said they will cover travel costs for their employees in the aftermath of the high court ruling that tossed out Roe v. Wade including elective abortions. But a Walmart spokesperson didn’t immediately reply for a request for comment on whether any of the company’s revised policy will cover elective abortions as well.

“It’s a step in the right direction but it’s simply not far enough for a company that employs that many women” said Bianca Agustin director of corporate accountability program for United for Respect a group that advocates for Walmart workers. She said the organization will be incorporating “safe abortions” for employees in their list of demands pressing the company for better pay and benefits.

The careful expansion of Walmart’s abortion policy shows it’s attempting to balance different pressures and opinions from employees investors and other stakeholders said Vanessa Burbano a professor at Columbia University’s business school who researches how companies take social stances. “It’s much trickier than a lot of people initially think it is. It’s not like all of their stakeholders are of the same opinion on any of these issues which is what makes it so challenging. They’re trying to figure out how to thread that needle.”

In the memo sent Friday Walmart said it will also launch a centre that provides fertility services to employees such as in vitro fertilization. Additionally it vowed to add surrogacy support and increase its financial aid for adoptions from $5000 to $20000. In June Walmart said it would expand its offering of doulas to address racial disparities in maternal care.

Amazon announced Wednesday afternoon that it would end Amazon Care operations after December 31. In an email to Amazon Health Services employees Neil Lindsay senior vice president of Amazon Health Services said Amazon Care wasn't a sustainable long-term solution for its enterprise customers.

Amazon provided a copy of the email to Fierce Healthcare.

The decision only impacts Amazon Care and Care Medical teams and not Amazon's other healthcare services.

While operating Amazon Care the company ""gathered and listened to extensive feedback"" from its enterprise customers and their employees and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers Lindsay wrote in the email to employees.

""However despite these efforts we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31 2022"" Lindsay wrote.

""This decision wasn’t made lightly and only became clear after many months of careful consideration. Although our enrolled members have loved many aspects of Amazon Care it is not a complete enough offering for the large enterprise customers we have been targeting and wasn’t going to work long-term"" he said.

Amazon Care was a cornerstone of the company's efforts to expand its footprint in the healthcare industry. The online retail company piloted virtual urgent care and primary care services with Amazon employees and their families in the Seattle region in 2019.

Amazon Care has since expanded rapidly with telehealth services available in all 50 states and in-person services in at least seven cities including Dallas D.C. and Baltimore. As part of its ambitions in healthcare Amazon then focused on ramping up partnerships with employers and signed on other companies as clients including Silicon Labs TrueBlue Whole Foods Market Precor—a Washington-based fitness equipment company that was acquired by Peloton—and Hilton.

Some industry insiders have said that Amazon Care struggled to gain a foothold with employer clients.

The company was on track to rapidly expand its hybrid care model to more than 20 additional cities in 2022 including major metropolitan areas like San Francisco Miami Chicago and New York City.

CEO Andy Jassy has made healthcare a priority citing Amazon Care as an example of “iterative innovation” in his first letter to shareholders earlier this year. In July the company announced plans to buy concierge primary care provider One Medical in a deal valued at approximately $3.9 billion.

If the One Medical deal goes through it would significantly expand Amazon's foothold in the nearly $4 trillion healthcare market specifically in the competitive primary care market.

One Medical markets itself as a membership-based tech-integrated consumer-focused primary care platform. The company operates 188 offices in 29 markets. At the end of March One Medical had 767000 members.

The deal also gives Amazon rapid access to the lucrative employer market as One Medical works with 8000 companies.

The One Medical acquisition has not yet closed.

Lindsay said the company's work building Amazon Care has deepened its understanding of ""what's needed long-term to deliver meaningful health care solutions for enterprise and individual customers.""

""I believe the health care space is ripe for reinvention and our efforts to help improve the health care experience can have an immensely positive impact on our quality of life and health outcomes. However none of these reasons make this decision any easier for the teams that have helped to build Amazon Care or for the customers our Care team serves"" he wrote.

The decision to cease Amazon Care's operations will likely mean some employees will be laid off. Lindsay said in his email to employees that many Amazon Care employees will have an opportunity to join other parts of the Health Services organization or other teams at Amazon. ""We'll also support employees looking for roles outside of the company"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjIvMDgvMjQvYW1hem9uLWNhcmUtdGVsZWhlYWx0aC1zaHV0dGluZy1kb3duL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon Care is shutting down - The Washington Post,"Amazon will shutter Amazon Care the virtual and in-home health service it initially created for its employees by the end of this year — a surprising move given the company’s recent investment in the health-care space.

People who work at Amazon Care learned the news in a meeting on Wednesday according to two people with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they signed nondisclosure agreements.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3RlY2hub2xvZ3ktd2hvbGUtZm9vZHMtbWFya2V0LWluYy1hbWF6b25jb20tZjcxNWJkNzM1OTBjZDllMTk5NTFlNGNhNzdjNzVlMmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon keeps growing and so does its cache of data on you,"From what you buy online to how you remember tasks to when you monitor your doorstep Amazon is seemingly everywhere.

And it appears the company doesn’t want to halt its reach anytime soon. In recent weeks Amazon has said it will spend billions of dollars in two gigantic acquisitions that if approved will broaden its ever growing presence in the lives of consumers.

This time the company is targeting two areas: health care through its $3.9 billion buyout of the primary care company One Medical and the “smart home” where it plans to expand its already mighty presence through a $1.7 billion merger with iRobot the maker of the popular robotic Roomba vacuum.

Perhaps unsurprisingly for a company known for its vast collection of consumer information both mergers have heightened enduring privacy concerns about how Amazon gathers data and what it does with it. The latest line of Roombas for example employ sensors that map and remember a home’s floor plan.

“It’s acquiring this vast set of data that Roomba collects about people’s homes” said Ron Knox an Amazon critic who works for the anti-monopoly group Institute for Local Self-Reliance. “Its obvious intent through all the other products that it sells to consumers is to be in your home. (And) along with the privacy issues come the antitrust issues because it’s buying market share.”

Amazon’s reach goes well beyond that. Some estimates show the retail giant controls roughly 38% of the U.S. e-commerce market allowing it to gather granular data about the shopping preferences of millions of Americans and more worldwide. Meanwhile its Echo devices which house the voice assistant Alexa have dominated the U.S. smart speaker market accounting for roughly 70% of sales according to estimates by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners.

Ring which Amazon purchased in 2018 for $1 billion monitors doorsteps and helps police track down crime — even when users might not be aware. And at select Amazon stores and Whole Foods the company is testing a palm-scanning technology that allows customers to pay for items by storing biometric data in the cloud sparking concerns about risks of a data breach which Amazon has attempted to assuage.

“We treat your palm signature just like other highly sensitive personal data and keep it safe using best-in-class technical and physical security controls” the company said on a website that provides information about the technology.

Even consumers who actively avoid Amazon are still likely to have little say about how their employers power their computer networks which Amazon — along with Google — has long dominated through its cloud-computing service AWS.

“It’s hard to think of another organization that has as many touch points as Amazon does to an individual” said Ian Greenblatt who heads up tech research at the consumer research and data analytics firm J.D. Power. “It’s almost overwhelming and it’s hard to put a finger on it.”

And Amazon — like any company — aims to grow. In the past few years the company has purchased the Wi-Fi startup Eero and partnered with the construction company Lennar to offer tech-powered houses. With iRobot it would gain one more building block for the ultimate smart home — and of course more data.

Customers can opt out of having iRobot devices store a layout of their homes according to the vacuum maker. But data privacy advocates worry the merger is another way Amazon could suck up information to integrate into its other devices or use to target consumers with ads.

In a statement Amazon spokesperson Lisa Levandowski denied that’s what the company wants to do.

“We do not use home maps for targeted advertising and have no plans to do so” Levandowski said.

Whether that will relieve concerns is another matter especially in light of research about Amazon’s other devices. Earlier this year a group of university researchers released a report that found voice data from Amazon’s Echo devices are used to target ads to consumers — something the company had denied in the past.

Umar Iqbal a postdoc at the University of Washington who led the research said he and his colleagues found Echo devices running third-party Skills which are like apps for Alexa that communicate with advertisers.

Levandowski said consumers can opt out of receiving “interest-based” ads by adjusting their preferences on Amazon’s advertising preferences page. She also said Amazon doesn’t share Alexa requests with advertising networks.

Skills that collect personal information are required to post their privacy policies on a detail page in Amazon’s store according to the company. Researchers however found only 2% of Skills are clear about their data collection practices and the vast majority don’t mention Alexa or Amazon at all.

For companies like Amazon data collection is for more than just data’s sake noted Kristen Martin a professor of technology ethics at the University of Notre Dame.

“You can almost see them just trying to paint a broader picture of an individual” Martin said. “It’s about the inferences that they’re able to draw about you specifically and then you compared to other people.”

Amazon’s One Medical deal for instance has sparked questions about how the company would handle personal health data that would fall into its lap.

Should the deal close Levandowski said customers’ health information will be handled separately from all other Amazon businesses. She also added Amazon wouldn’t share personal health information outside of One Medical for “advertising or marketing purposes of other Amazon products and services without clear permission from the customer.”

But Lucia Savage a chief privacy officer at the chronic care provider Omada Health said that doesn’t mean One Medical wouldn’t be able to get data from other arms of Amazon’s business that could help it better profile its patients. The information just has to flow one way she said.

To be sure privacy concerns are not limited to Amazon. In the aftermath of Roe v Wade being overturned for instance Google said it would automatically get rid of information about users who visit abortion clinics amid pressure from Democratic lawmakers. Meanwhile Meta which owns Facebook settled a class action lawsuit in February over its use of “cookies” about a decade ago that tracked users after they logged off Facebook.

But unlike Meta and Google whose focus is mainly on selling ads Amazon might benefit more from collecting data because its primary goal is to sell products said Alex Harman director of competition policy at the anti-monopoly group Economic Security Project.

“For them data is all about getting you to buy more and be locked into their stuff” Harman said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlZWt3aXJlLmNvbS8yMDIyL2ludGVybmFsLW1lbW8tYW1hem9uLWNhcmUtdG8tc2h1dC1kb3duLW5vdC1hLWNvbXBsZXRlLWVub3VnaC1vZmZlcmluZy1mb3ItY29ycG9yYXRlLWN1c3RvbWVycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Internal memo: Amazon Care to shut down 'not a complete enough offering' for corporate customers,"Amazon Care is a hybrid virtual and in-home primary care service that launched in 2019. (Amazon Image)

Amazon will stop offering its Amazon Care primary health-care services at the end of this year according to an internal memo after determining that it wasn’t “the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers.”

The surprise move Wednesday is a major course correction in Amazon’s broader foray into healthcare. Amazon says the decision impacts only Amazon Care and not its other health-care initiatives.

“This decision wasn’t made lightly and only became clear after many months of careful consideration” said Neil Lindsay Amazon Health Services senior vice president in the email to Amazon Health Services employees. “Although our enrolled members have loved many aspects of Amazon Care it is not a complete enough offering for the large enterprise customers we have been targeting and wasn’t going to work long-term.”

Amazon says company leaders determined that the Amazon Care business model wasn’t working prior to and independent from its agreement to acquire primary care company One Medical for $3.9 billion which was announced July 21. That acquisition is still expected to move ahead pending regulatory approval.

The company did not disclose the number of employees who will be impacted by its decision to shut down Amazon Care.

“Many Care employees will have an opportunity to join other parts of the Health Services organization or other teams at Amazon – which we’ll be discussing with many of you shortly – and we’ll also support employees looking for roles outside of the company” Lindsay wrote in the memo to employees.

Amazon Care launched in 2019 as a pilot program for employees in the Seattle area where Amazon is headquartered. Last year it expanded to non-Amazon employees across the nation.

It is a hybrid of virtual in-home primary care and urgent care services without brick-and-mortar clinics or physical locations.

Chrissy Farr a health tech investor at OMERS Ventures said there may have been potential overlap with One Medical “that may have been awkward to navigate.” One Medical also sells into employers and offers telemedicine services.

“It could be a signal of where Amazon plans to focus its energies” Farr said noting that she did not have first-hand knowledge of the reasons for the decision.

Amazon became a leader in giant industries such as online shopping and cloud computing but successfully transforming the “huge troubled tangled health care sector” won’t be easy noted a recent Harvard Business Review analysis that detailed significant challenges facing the company’s foray into primary care.

Given the size complexity and potential for technology to further transform the healthcare market the sector has emerged as one of the most likely industries where Amazon could find a fourth pillar of its business alongside its existing three: Amazon Web Services Amazon Prime and Amazon Marketplace.

The company launched its Amazon Pharmacy service in November 2020 following its $753 million acquisition of prescription-by-mail company PillPack in 2018.

Amazon is known for sticking to a long-term vision while experimenting with different approaches to achieve its goals. In fact Amazon Care not the first high-profile healthcare initiative from Amazon to close down. The company last year ended its Haven joint venture with Berkshire Hathaway and JP Morgan Chase.

Up to this point Amazon Care appeared to be moving steadily forward.

In February Amazon said in-person Amazon Care services were expanding to 20 new cities in 2022. Companies such as Hilton TrueBlue Silicon Labs and others use Amazon Care as a benefit for employees.

Amazon was preparing to add behavioral health support to Amazon Care Insider reported earlier this month teaming up with mental health company Ginger as part of the expansion.

Speaking at Wall Street Journal event last year Amazon Care executive Babak Parviz said the company needed “thousands of employees” to help grow the service and hinted that Amazon Care could expand to rural areas.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy called out Amazon Care in his first shareholders letter published in April.

The company said earlier this year that Amazon Care had a “patient satisfaction rating” of 4.7 out of 5. The Amazon Care app has a 4.9 rating on Apple’s App Store and a 4.8 rating on Google Play.

In hindsight one hint of the decision may have come earlier this month: Kristen Helton who was general manager in charge of Amazon Care was reported by Bloomberg News to be taking an “extended break.”

The Washington Post last week reported on tension between Amazon and medical staffers who questioned how the company was balancing growth and efficiency with traditional medical safeguards. The report also highlighted how the national nurse shortage has curbed Amazon Care’s expansion.

A recent analysis from Trilliant Health shows that telehealth demand declined nearly 60% from April 2020 to April 2022 “suggesting that expanded availability of virtual care options has not shifted widespread consumer preferences.”

Amazon says Amazon Care patients can request copies of their medical records by emailing help@amazon.care or calling 1-855-594-6478. Amazon says it complies with all applicable laws for patient medical records. The company says it will also work with enterprise customers to support their needs through the end of the year.

Here is the full text of Lindsay’s memo to employees.

Health Services team We are working on an important missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast but we believe it matters.

You’ve heard me say it before but I believe the health care space is ripe for reinvention and our efforts to help improve the health care experience can have an immensely positive impact on our quality of life and health outcomes. However none of these reasons make this decision any easier for the teams that have helped to build Amazon Care or for the customers our Care team serves. Our priority right now is to support you regardless of the path you take. Many Care employees will have an opportunity to join other parts of the Health Services organization or other teams at Amazon – which we’ll be discussing with many of you shortly – and we’ll also support employees looking for roles outside of the company. To the Amazon Care and Care Medical teams thank you for all of your hard work over these last several years. You should be very proud of what this team has been able to accomplish in a short period of time. I am also thankful to our members and business customers for entrusting us with their care; this is not a responsibility we take lightly. As we take our learnings from Amazon Care we will continue to invent learn from our customers and industry partners and hold ourselves to the highest standards as we further help reimagine the future of health care.

Amazon will shutter the service after Dec. 31 Amazon Health Services lead Neil Lindsay announced Wednesday in a company email. The e-commerce giant decided to make the move after determining it wasn't ""the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers"" Lindsay wrote in the memo which was previously reported by GeekWire.

""This decision wasn't made lightly and only became clear after many months of careful consideration"" Lindsay said. ""Although our enrolled members have loved many aspects of Amazon Care it is not a complete enough offering for the large enterprise customers we have been targeting and wasn't going to work long-term.""

Even though the service is ending Amazon gained a deeper understanding of ""what's needed long-term to deliver meaningful health care solutions for enterprise and individual customers"" through its rollout of Amazon Care Lindsay wrote in the memo.

Amazon Care launched in 2019 as a pilot program for employees in and around the company's Seattle headquarters. The service provides virtual urgent care visits as well as free telehealth consults and in-home visits for a fee from nurses for testing and vaccinations.

The service was several years in the making. In 2017 Amazon held a secret meeting in Seattle to learn more about patient care that was attended by heavyweights from the health care industry CNBC reported. It then hired a small group of doctors to start a pilot clinic for some employees.

In February the company rolled out Amazon Care's virtual offerings nationwide for its employees and other companies signaling it had greater ambitions for the service.

It's unclear how much traction Amazon Care had gained. Last June Babak Parviz a vice president working on Amazon Care said Amazon had attracted multiple companies interested in using the service. Its corporate customers include Hilton Silicon Labs TrueBlue and Whole Foods the company-owned upscale grocer.

Amazon is sunsetting the service even as CEO Andy Jassy has committed to make inroads in the health care industry. Last month Amazon acquired boutique primary care provider One Medical for $3.9 billion. It also has sought to develop at-home medical diagnostics. And earlier this week The Wall Street Journal reported Amazon is bidding for home health services provider Signify Health .

Following a trend that started during the pandemic many supermarket delis are focusing on meat products that offer convenience while keeping products fresh longer which is largely a function of their packaging solutions.

“Innovative and unique look and feel from print technologies continues to evolve and innovate into new and trending technologies” said Melanie Bandari senior marketing manager for meat poultry and seafood at Amcor Flexibles North America Oshkosh Wis. “New entrants in the deli meat space focus on smaller more premium brands versus large mass-produced brands.”

Ryan Spencer product market manager for chambers portioning and slicing at Multivac Inc. Kansas City Mo. has noticed more demand for grab-and-go packaging that is designed to look like it was cut and packaged at the in-store deli counter.

“The footprint of the in-store deli in many grocery stores is either shrinking or disappearing entirely as offerings such as prepared meals in-store restaurants sushi bars and the like are becoming more prevalent” he said. “Grab-and-go packaging allows retailers to provide sliced meats and cheeses in a familiar-looking package that customers are seeking without requiring a fully staffed deli section.”

Multivac offers many solutions in this area starting with slicing and running all the way to palletizing.

“When it comes to package design we have the experience to provide best practices and ideas or we can take concepts from the customer and recommend the best way to achieve it” Spencer said.

Furthermore grab-and-go pre-packaged deli meat packaging is a growing segment for enhanced retailer convenience with the added benefit of a product delivered safely direct from the manufacturer.

“Our pre-packaged grab-and-go deli line offers a freshly sliced deli packaging’s look and feel but the retailer doesn’t incur the labor costs of packing it on premises” Bandari said. “The products are packaged on TFFS as well as new HFFS flow wrap lines.”

For 40 years Kansas City Mo.-based Weber has been a global leader in industrial high-speed slicing systems. Five years ago Weber acquired a thermoform packaging company and got into the packaging game.

“There’s a ton of innovation that we’ve rolled out where we feel we are pushing the industry forward in how these solutions are put together holistically” said Zach Bearson director of new business development for Weber. “Instead of 6-7 machines on a line that work together in a simple way we’re thinking of these lines as one solution that works within itself communicating within machines.”

For instance customers utilize Weber’s solutions from hygienic product preparation to weight-accurate slicing and automated insertion to the desired presentation in the packaging whether they want trays or tubular bags.

“We can integrate tray sealers or flow packers into the Weber line as alternative packaging machines to the thermoformer and take care of seamless integration without interfaces for a smooth production process” Bearson said.

Carlo Bergonzi product manager for Tray Seal at Harpak-ULMA Packaging noted in terms of pre-made containers there’s been an increased need for reclosability whether it’s peel/reseal or rigid lid.

“Easy open and re-close is key so you can use a portion of the product and open and close as much as a dozen times” he said. “Grab-and-go is big right now so anything that offers convenient packaging is in vogue.”

Dave Favret product manager for Thermoforming at Harpak-ULMA Packaging added that suppliers are slicing and delivering grab-and-go packages that are being handled at a facility outside of the grocery store though it looks like it is done on site.

“The perception of freshness is important” he said. “But there’s a number of different things that are on the mind of consumers such as packaging formats that use less plastic are easier to manufacture and are more sustainable.”

Environmentally sound

Sustainability continues to be important and top of mind for environmentally conscious consumers and resealability is a very important function of deli packaging today.

“The focus on sustainability continues to grow and mature” Spencer said. “Customers are not only more concerned with the product inside the package but with the package itself as well. What materials is it made of? Is it recyclable? If not has the packaging been reduced to limit the impact on the environment? These are not theoretical questions anymore. Consumers are making buying decisions based on the answers to these questions.”

A good example from Multivac is the spray interleaving system on its slicer. Instead of using paper or plastic sheets between pieces of sliced meats and cheeses to allow for proper slice release its spray system applies a small amount of oil that is allergen-free tasteless and does not produce any additional waste.

Bergonzi has recently seen more interest in sustainability with molded fiber trays with a pouch inside and a rigid lid or a PED tray with reseal — something that’s reducing plastic as much as possible but also re-closeable.

“They are trying to use as much sustainable material as they can — with some deli products even packaged with a paper-feel material” he said. “That has an appeal to many.”

Amcor’s SmartTack EZ Peel Reseal and SmartTack Die Cut Resealable Label lines are popular as they allow customers the convenience of resealable packaging while maintaining the freshness consumers expect in a deli meat package. These resealable options also offer substantial tamper evidence for added consumer safety.

“Our Catalyst program helps our customers solve market and sustainability needs through packaging innovation” Bandari said. “Through smart insight imagination and innovation we collaborate to spark meaningful ideas accelerate growth and move brands forward. Amcor’s ASSET is a third-party certified tool for performing new package sustainability metrics and can support customers’ on-pack messaging.”

On the rise

One area poised for significant growth is paper-based solutions as they offer consumers a positive end of life story with existing curbside recycle streams.

With this in mind Amcor is bringing multiple high barrier paper-based formats to market including Amcor Packpyrus a new line of thermoformable paper in combination with high oxygen barrier materials for extended shelf life and a significant reduction in fossil derived materials.

“The product is widely sold in Europe today for deli meats and is expanding into the Americas” Bandari said. “The structure is 85% paper with a barrier layer to ensure product freshness and maintain shelf life. Its lightweight footprint offers space reduction with upscale merchandising for shallow draw applications like shingled deli meats.”

The labor market was a catalyst for many companies automating and reducing the lines on the floor and Weber is coming up with solutions so customers can repurpose labor and be more efficient through its packaging solutions.

“From a manufacturing perspective we take a different approach” said Mike King technical solutions manager of packaging for Weber. “We own our own vision company so all the components on the line are engineered and programmed by Weber in-house which is a completely different philosophy than what else is going on out there.”

Looks matter

Packaging in the cluttered retail environment requires an exclusive look and premium appearance to stand out on the shelf and to attract consumers.

For instance Amcor’s Amplify finishing technologies create a “stop the cart” experience with a portfolio of sensory solutions designed to create engagement opportunities according to Bandari.

“Amcor has invested in another Amplify production asset in order to meet the high demand for shelf differentiated print technologies” she said. “This asset came on-line in 2022 and was built for handling shorter runs with added flexibility. We are now equipped to handle demanding flexo and roto designs covering short to long run production needs with redundant manufacturing operations.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wZW5wci5jb20vbmV3cy8yNzE0NjY4L3NxdWVlemUtdHViZS1wYWNrYWdpbmctbWFya2V0LWdyb3d0aC1vdXRsb29rLTIwMjItYnVzaW5lc3PSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Squeeze Tube Packaging Market Growth Outlook: 2022 Business Experts Industry Trends and Development ...,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wZW5wci5jb20vbmV3cy8yNzE0NjY4L3NxdWVlemUtdHViZS1wYWNrYWdpbmctbWFya2V0LWdyb3d0aC1vdXRsb29rLTIwMjItYnVzaW5lc3PSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159B8C82680>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wZW5wci5jb20vbmV3cy8yNzE0NjY4L3NxdWVlemUtdHViZS1wYWNrYWdpbmctbWFya2V0LWdyb3d0aC1vdXRsb29rLTIwMjItYnVzaW5lc3PSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,

Yet coal continues to produce the lion’s share of greenhouse gas emissions associated with U.S. power production. Last year coal was responsible for 22 percent of the country’s electricity generation but 60 percent of power-sector CO2 emissions according to federal data.

The dynamic is owing in large part to a series of large coal plants that continue to churn out power and pump CO2 into the atmosphere. The 10 top CO2 emitters accounted for 9 percent of total U.S. power-sector emissions last year according to EPA figures.

These plants are outliers of sorts in the U.S. power system. Where many coal plants have reduced power generation or closed altogether these coal giants continue to churn out electricity around the clock. And while their parent companies increasingly plan to phase out coal to satisfy ambitious midcentury climate goals these plants are generally scheduled to run well past 2030.

“It’s slowly bifurcating into two very different types of coal plants” said Joe Daniel an electricity analyst at RMI.

In most cases utilities are moving away from coal for economic reasons he said. That was especially evident last year when an increase in natural gas prices resulted in only a modest increase in coal generation.

“Low gas prices killed coal but high gas prices don’t seem to be bringing it back” Daniel said.

Yet in a small number of instances some coal plants continue to run hard. In some cases the reason might be regulatory. Daniel pointed to the example of West Virginia where utility regulators are exploring a minimum generation threshold for the state’s coal fleet. Others may not be subject to stringent air quality rules.

And in still other cases power companies may elect to run their power plants regardless of short-term fluctuations in electricity prices. Some coal plants struggle to ramp up and down quickly giving utilities a reason to keep them operating outside short-term market conditions.

“Most utilities to their credit have seen the light. They realize now the writing is on the wall and they’re following” Daniel said. “But the ones that haven’t you’re getting a concentration and bifurcation of where the outliers are.”

The following is a list of the country’s top polluting power plants. All of them are coal facilities. The list is based on emissions data from EPA and power plant information from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Emissions from any one plant can fluctuate from year to year because of market conditions or maintenance schedules. To account for that the list also provides emissions for the last decade to give a better sense of which plant’s are traditionally among the country’s dirtiest and which have more recently moved into the top 10.

Most of the plants here are traditionally among the country’s top emitters but there are some exceptions. Several coal giants have seen their power production decline in recent years prompting their emissions to fall. That has opened up slots to facilities that traditionally fell just outside the top 10.

1. James H. Miller

Owner: Southern Co.

State: Alabama

Capacity (megawatts): 2820

Began operations: 1978

2021 CO2 emissions (million tons): 23

2012-2021 emissions (million tons): 214

2012-2021 emissions ranking: 1

Retirement date: none

Plant Miller has recorded the highest CO2 emissions in America for eight consecutive years. In 2021 its CO2 emissions were nearly 23 million tons about 5 million tons more than the second-largest emitter.

Miller’s position atop the emissions rankings is owing to its size and generating prowess. The plant’s nameplate capacity of 2820 megawatts ranks fifth most among coal plants nationally. But where other coal giants have seen their output decline in recent years Miller’s boilers continue to hum. In 2021 it ran 83 percent of the year according to federal statistics far eclipsing the average run time of 49 percent for a U.S. coal plant.

While Southern Co. has announced plans to shut down half its coal fleet in the coming years it has offered no indication it will shutter any of Miller’s four generating units anytime soon (Energywire May 27 2021). Southern has promised to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

2. Labadie

Owner: Ameren Corp.

State: Missouri

Capacity (megawatts): 2388

Began operations: 1970

2021 CO2 emissions (million tons): 17

2012-2021 emissions (million tons): 161

2012-2021 emissions ranking: 4

Retirement date: two units in 2036; two units in 2042

Like many of the utilities on this list Ameren has announced plans to achieve net-zero emissions. It recently updated its plan to reach the target by 2045. It plans to run Labadie its largest coal facility almost until then. It plans call for closing two of the plant’s four units in 2036 and the remaining two in 2042.

Labadie’s 17.2 million tons of CO2 emissions is its highest annual total since 2011. It ran 79 percent of the year in 2021 taking it higher in the emissions rankings than the plants that often record higher emissions.

3. Monroe

Owner: DTE Energy

State: Michigan

Capacity (megawatts): 3280

Began operations: 1971

2021 CO2 emissions (million tons): 16

2012-2021 emissions (million tons): 163

2012-2021 emissions ranking: 3

Retirement date: 2040

Monroe has seen its emissions fall slightly in recent years. Where the southeastern Michigan plant emitted around 19 million tons in 2008 its emissions were 15.7 million tons last year. Still that amounts to the third most of any power plant in the nation in 2021.

DTE is currently planning on closing Monroe in 2040 but has said it will study an earlier retirement date as part of its long-term plan submitted to Michigan utility regulators. The Detroit-based power company has pledged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

The W.A. Parish Generating Station in Texas. | RM VM/Wikipedia

4. W.A. Parish

Owner: NRG Energy

State: Texas

Capacity (megawatts): 4008 (2736 coal)

Began operations: 1958 (first coal 1968)

2021 CO2 emissions (million tons): 15

2012-2021 emissions (million tons): 153

2012-2021 emissions ranking): 7

Retirement date: none

Parish is the fourth-largest power plant in the country in terms of capacity. Unlike the other facilities on this list Parish also boasts significant gas generation to complement its coal units. One of its smaller coal units was even equipped with carbon capture and sequestration between 2016 and 2020 when the CCS unit was taken offline.

Parish has struggled with mechanical issues more recently. It experienced a hydrogen fire earlier this year and reported outages during Winter Storm Uri in 2020 (Energywire July 11; Climatewire March 18 2021). And several of its generating units were offline earlier this summer when power demand in Texas was surging.

While the first three plants on this list are run by utilities that operated as regulated monopolies Parish is a participant in Texas’ competitive wholesale market for power. That makes its long-term future more difficult to predict since the plant’s fortunes are dependent on market conditions. NRG has not outlined a closure date for the plant.

5. Martin Lake

Owner: Vistra Corp.

State: Texas

Capacity (megawatts): 2379

Began operations: 1977

2021 CO2 emissions (million tons): 14.8

2012-2021 emissions (million tons): 151

2012-2021 emissions ranking: 8

Retirement date: none

Before 2011 this plant in northeast Texas regularly reported annual CO2 emissions in excess of 20 million tons. Last year it posted CO2 emissions of 14.8 million tons. The decline in CO2 output has coincided with a drop in electricity production. In 2011 the plant ran 84 percent of the year. Last year Martin Lake was on 63 percent of the time.

The Gen. James M. Gavin Power Plant in Cheshire Ohio. | Analogue Kid/Wikipedia

6. Gen. James M. Gavin

Owner: Lightstone Generation

State: Ohio

Capacity (megawatts): 2600

Began operations: 1974

2021 CO2 emissions (million tons): 14.7

2012-2021 emissions (million tons): 156

2012-2021 emissions ranking: 6

Retirement date: none

Lightstone Generation a joint venture of ArcLight Capital and the Blackstone Group bought Gavin from American Electric Power in 2016. Gavin’s electricity production and the emissions it creates has held relatively steady in the PJM Interconnection the gas-reliant wholesale electricity market encompassing much of the Mid-Atlantic and parts of the Midwest. Gavin posted a run time of 61 percent in 2021.

Earlier this year EPA denied Gavin’s application for an extension to keep operating coal ash ponds at the power plant (Greenwire Jan. 11). The ponds are used to store fly ash and sludge left over from burning coal in boilers. In a subsequent regulatory filing Gavin’s owners said they were moving to adopt a new method of handling coal ash to meet EPA’s regulations.

7. Oak Grove

Owner: Vistra Corp.

State: Texas

Capacity (megawatts): 1794

Began operations: 2010

2021 CO2 emissions (million tons): 13.8

2012-2021 emissions (million tons): 135

2012-2021 emissions ranking: 10

Retirement date: none

Oak Grove is the first of two relatively new coal plants to make this list. It is part of the last wave of coal plants built in the United States making it a baby compared with most American coal plants.

Its spot here reflects the steady nature of its power production and falling output from its older counterparts. In 2012 Oak Grove recorded emissions of 12.4 million tons making it the 27th-largest CO2 emitter in the country that year. Last year its 13.8 million tons of CO2 ranked seventh nationally.

8. Prairie State Energy Campus

Owner: nine public power companies

State: Illinois

Capacity (megawatts): 1776

Began operations: 2010

2021 CO2 emissions (million tons): 13.6

2012-2021 emissions (million tons): 113

2012-2021 emissions ranking: 23

Retirement date: Prairie State must be 100 percent carbon free by 2045 under Illinois law.

The other baby to make this list Prairie State could well be the last coal plant operating in Illinois. That’s because Illinois passed a law last year requiring all privately owned coal plants in the state to close by 2030 (Climatewire Dec. 7 2021). The law contains a carve-out for Prairie State which must reduce its emissions 45 percent by 2035 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2045. The plant is owned by a group of public power cooperatives.

The John E. Amos Power plant in West Virginia. | Tikilucas/Wikipedia

9. John Amos

Owner: American Electric Power

State: West Virginia

Capacity (megawatts): 2932

Began operations: 1971

2021 CO2 emissions (million tons): 12.6

2012-2021 emissions (million tons): 132

2012-2021 emissions ranking: 12

Retirement date: 2040

John Amos’ power generation rebounded slightly after 2020 when electricity demand was depressed due to Covid-19 lockdowns. Still the plant only ran 47 percent of the year in 2021 according to federal data. That helps explain John Amos’ emissions of 12.6 million tons last year which were less than the 13.2 million tons the plant averaged over the last decade.

John Amos has been at the center of a three-state controversy in recent years. Utility regulators in Kentucky and Virginia barred AEP from charging ratepayers to upgrade the facility’s wastewater system. That tab will now be picked up by West Virginia consumers (Energywire Oct. 14 2021).

10. Sam Seymour Power Plant (also known as Fayette Power Project)

Owner: Lower Colorado River Authority and Austin Energy

State: Texas

Capacity (megawatts): 1660

Began operations: 1979

2021 CO2 emissions (million tons): 12

2012-2021 emissions (million tons): 114

2012-2021 emissions ranking: 22

Retirement date: none.

Sam Seymour is not a regular in the top 10. The Texas power plant averaged annual emissions of about 11 million tons over the last decade. But as other coal plants have seen their power output decline a relatively normal year from Sam Seymour puts it among the top CO2 emitters in the nation.

Austin Energy had proposed retiring its share of two units this year but was unable to agree to a deal to do so with the Lower Colorado River Authority.

Notable omissions

A number of large emitters are notably absent from this year’s list.

Plant Scherer a Georgia coal plant emitted 177 million tons over the last decade the second most of any power plant in the country. But Scherer’s electricity generation has plunged in recent years prompting its emissions to also fall. The plant reported carbon emissions of roughly 10 million tons last year.

Two Florida utilities announced in 2020 that they would retire one of the plant’s four units this year (Energywire June 30 2020). Southern Co. which operates the plant and owns a stake in the plant’s three other units plans to retire another unit in 2028.

Scherer is not the only mega-emitter to fall out of the top 10. Another is Duke Energy’s Gibson Station in Indiana which recorded emissions of 156 million tons over the last 10 years. That was the fifth most of any power plant in the country. Duke’s current plans call for gradually phasing out the plant by 2035.

The last big emitter notably absent from the top 10 is Colstrip Generating Station in Montana which ranked ninth among power plant emitters over the last decade. Colstrip closed two of its smaller units in 2020 which has reduced its CO2 output somewhat. It nevertheless remains a larger emitter. Colstrip reported CO2 emissions of nearly 11 million tons in 2021 the 15th most in the country.

Aug 23 2022 10:30 AM ET

American Airlines announced a donation of $1.5 million to the Organization of Black Aerospace Professionals (OBAP) Luke Weathers Flight Academy during the organization’s 46th annual conference held Aug. 10–12. American served as the title sponsor of OBAPs 46th annual conference which included several notable industry speakers aerospace professional development workshops and networking opportunities.

“Our strength lies in having a team especially pilots that represent the diverse communities we serve” said American CEO Robert Isom. “We must expose young people to careers in aviation provide relief to financial barriers and increase the number of underrepresented minority pilots on the flight deck.”

The contribution will provide resource grants and scholarships to the Lieutenant Colonel Luke Weathers Flight Academy to recruit and train pilots with diverse backgrounds and support the airline’s efforts to help the industry diversify the flight deck.

“The Luke Weathers Flight Academy is a one-of-a-kind training ground where students of all backgrounds especially aspiring pilots of color can receive the training support and mentorship pivotal to their success in the pilot profession” said Ret. Captain and Co-Director of the Luke Weathers Flight Academy Albert Glenn. “American’s support will only amplify our ability to prepare more aviators for successful careers.”

The conference also featured a career exhibit hall where qualified pilots were able to interview with dozens of participating carriers including American who extended job offers to 45 diverse aviators. American was the only mainline carrier to extend job offers to pilots at this year’s conference.

Providing students access to the aviation industry

American has been working with community organizations to help foster access to aviation. To help introduce youth to a variety of career opportunities American hosted more than 150 students systemwide at its facilities throughout the summer as a part of OBAP’s Aerospace Career Education (ACE) Academy. The Academy provides hands-on experience on the fundamentals of aerodynamics in fun innovative ways for middle and high school students.

In July American flew nearly 100 young aviation enthusiasts on a private charter from Chicago to Oshkosh Wisconsin for the annual EAA AirVenture. Students spent the day trying out flight simulators learning more about different careers in aviation and exploring various aircraft at the largest airshow in the world.

The flight was serviced by an all-Black flight crew including Captain David Ricketts OBAP member and mentor to many up-and-coming pilots.

“I joined OBAP over 25 years ago at a time when I was finding my way as a pilot and there weren’t many people who looked like me” Captain David Ricketts said. “And now I am grateful to be on the other side where I can use my platform to mentor diverse youth to be successful pilots.”

American announced the creation of the Elise Eberwein American Airlines Pilot Scholarship earlier this summer in honor of the executive leader devoted to our team members and creating a workforce that mirrors the communities the airline serves. The scholarship commits $1 million over the next 10 years to further the airline’s extensive efforts to increase and diversify the pilot ranks.

The donations are intended to help relieve financial barriers increase the number of underrepresented minority professionals engineers and scientists and ensure the future of aviation is diverse by exposing young people to careers in aviation.

Further the American Airlines Cadet Academy established in 2018 helps bridge the gap between a future pilot’s dreams and reality by not only connecting with flight schools but by connecting prospective pilots with financing and mentoring opportunities for the journey ahead. It’s the only program of its kind with two financial partnerships dedicated to supporting cadets and increasing the accessibility of the profession for prospective pilots.

Jayaram says he’s“transitioning from a memorable journey with one great American icon and taking to the skies with another” according to a recent LinkedIn post. As he reflects on his nearly 16 years at Deere he says Winnie the Pooh author A.A. Milne sums it up best: “How lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard.”

At Deere Jayaram worked with global IT team members to engineer the ongoing digital transformation of the company into a “smart industrial leader.” His roles included being vice president of information technology and vice president of corporate strategy and business development.

Before that Jayaram worked at Danaher Corporation and Canon USA Inc. and began his career at Boston Consulting Group. Jayaram holds a Bachelor of Technology from the Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi and a doctorate in Materials Science and Engineering from Northwestern University.

Since May the company has been searching for a replacement for Maya Leibman who has been CIO since 2012. Liebman previously announced she would relocate to the United Kingdom for family reasons and will take on new international responsibilities next year.

Leibman will help with the transition until the end of the year.

“[Liebman] has been a central leader in American’s evolution over the past decade” said Isom. “Her leadership has left an imprint on our entire organization and we are thankful for all that she has done. She has set us up well for this transition and we look forward to her continued leadership at American.”

Yet coal continues to produce the lion’s share of greenhouse gas emissions associated with U.S. power production. Last year coal was responsible for 22 percent of the country’s electricity generation but 60 percent of power-sector CO2 emissions according to federal data.

The dynamic is owing in large part to a series of large coal plants that continue to churn out power and pump CO2 into the atmosphere. The 10 top CO2 emitters accounted for 9 percent of total U.S. power-sector emissions last year according to EPA figures.

These plants are outliers of sorts in the U.S. power system. Where many coal plants have reduced power generation or closed altogether these coal giants continue to churn out electricity around the clock. And while their parent companies increasingly plan to phase out coal to satisfy ambitious midcentury climate goals these plants are generally scheduled to run well past 2030.

“It’s slowly bifurcating into two very different types of coal plants” said Joe Daniel an electricity analyst at RMI.

In most cases utilities are moving away from coal for economic reasons he said. That was especially evident last year when an increase in natural gas prices resulted in only a modest increase in coal generation.

“Low gas prices killed coal but high gas prices don’t seem to be bringing it back” Daniel said.

Yet in a small number of instances some coal plants continue to run hard. In some cases the reason might be regulatory. Daniel pointed to the example of West Virginia where utility regulators are exploring a minimum generation threshold for the state’s coal fleet. Others may not be subject to stringent air quality rules.

And in still other cases power companies may elect to run their power plants regardless of short-term fluctuations in electricity prices. Some coal plants struggle to ramp up and down quickly giving utilities a reason to keep them operating outside short-term market conditions.

“Most utilities to their credit have seen the light. They realize now the writing is on the wall and they’re following” Daniel said. “But the ones that haven’t you’re getting a concentration and bifurcation of where the outliers are.”

The following is a list of the country’s top polluting power plants. All of them are coal facilities. The list is based on emissions data from EPA and power plant information from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Emissions from any one plant can fluctuate from year to year because of market conditions or maintenance schedules. To account for that the list also provides emissions for the last decade to give a better sense of which plant’s are traditionally among the country’s dirtiest and which have more recently moved into the top 10.

Most of the plants here are traditionally among the country’s top emitters but there are some exceptions. Several coal giants have seen their power production decline in recent years prompting their emissions to fall. That has opened up slots to facilities that traditionally fell just outside the top 10.

The James H. Miller Jr. Electric Generating Plant in Alabama. | Jet Lowe/Library of Congress



1. James H. Miller

Owner: Southern Co.

State: Alabama

Capacity (megawatts): 2820

Began operations: 1978

2021 CO2 emissions (million tons): 23

2012-2021 emissions (million tons): 214

2012-2021 emissions ranking: 1

Retirement date: none

Plant Miller has recorded the highest CO2 emissions in America for eight consecutive years. In 2021 its CO2 emissions were nearly 23 million tons about 5 million tons more than the second-largest emitter.

Miller’s position atop the emissions rankings is owing to its size and generating prowess. The plant’s nameplate capacity of 2820 megawatts ranks fifth most among coal plants nationally. But where other coal giants have seen their output decline in recent years Miller’s boilers continue to hum. In 2021 it ran 83 percent of the year according to federal statistics far eclipsing the average run time of 49 percent for a U.S. coal plant.

While Southern Co. has announced plans to shut down half its coal fleet in the coming years it has offered no indication it will shutter any of Miller’s four generating units anytime soon (Energywire May 27 2021). Southern has promised to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

2. Labadie

Owner: Ameren Corp.

State: Missouri

Capacity (megawatts): 2388

Began operations: 1970

2021 CO2 emissions (million tons): 17

2012-2021 emissions (million tons): 161

2012-2021 emissions ranking: 4

Retirement date: two units in 2036; two units in 2042

Like many of the utilities on this list Ameren has announced plans to achieve net-zero emissions. It recently updated its plan to reach the target by 2045. It plans to run Labadie its largest coal facility almost until then. It plans call for closing two of the plant’s four units in 2036 and the remaining two in 2042.

Labadie’s 17.2 million tons of CO2 emissions is its highest annual total since 2011. It ran 79 percent of the year in 2021 taking it higher in the emissions rankings than the plants that often record higher emissions.

3. Monroe

Owner: DTE Energy

State: Michigan

Capacity (megawatts): 3280

Began operations: 1971

2021 CO2 emissions (million tons): 16

2012-2021 emissions (million tons): 163

2012-2021 emissions ranking: 3

Retirement date: 2040

Monroe has seen its emissions fall slightly in recent years. Where the southeastern Michigan plant emitted around 19 million tons in 2008 its emissions were 15.7 million tons last year. Still that amounts to the third most of any power plant in the nation in 2021.

DTE is currently planning on closing Monroe in 2040 but has said it will study an earlier retirement date as part of its long-term plan submitted to Michigan utility regulators. The Detroit-based power company has pledged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

The W.A. Parish Generating Station in Texas. | RM VM/Wikipedia

4. W.A. Parish

Owner: NRG Energy

State: Texas

Capacity (megawatts): 4008 (2736 coal)

Began operations: 1958 (first coal 1968)

2021 CO2 emissions (million tons): 15

2012-2021 emissions (million tons): 153

2012-2021 emissions ranking): 7

Retirement date: none

Parish is the fourth-largest power plant in the country in terms of capacity. Unlike the other facilities on this list Parish also boasts significant gas generation to complement its coal units. One of its smaller coal units was even equipped with carbon capture and sequestration between 2016 and 2020 when the CCS unit was taken offline.

Parish has struggled with mechanical issues more recently. It experienced a hydrogen fire earlier this year and reported outages during Winter Storm Uri in 2020 (Energywire July 11; Climatewire March 18 2021). And several of its generating units were offline earlier this summer when power demand in Texas was surging.

While the first three plants on this list are run by utilities that operated as regulated monopolies Parish is a participant in Texas’ competitive wholesale market for power. That makes its long-term future more difficult to predict since the plant’s fortunes are dependent on market conditions. NRG has not outlined a closure date for the plant.

5. Martin Lake

Owner: Vistra Corp.

State: Texas

Capacity (megawatts): 2379

Began operations: 1977

2021 CO2 emissions (million tons): 14.8

2012-2021 emissions (million tons): 151

2012-2021 emissions ranking: 8

Retirement date: none

Before 2011 this plant in northeast Texas regularly reported annual CO2 emissions in excess of 20 million tons. Last year it posted CO2 emissions of 14.8 million tons. The decline in CO2 output has coincided with a drop in electricity production. In 2011 the plant ran 84 percent of the year. Last year Martin Lake was on 63 percent of the time.

The Gen. James M. Gavin Power Plant in Cheshire Ohio. | Analogue Kid/Wikipedia

6. Gen. James M. Gavin

Owner: Lightstone Generation

State: Ohio

Capacity (megawatts): 2600

Began operations: 1974

2021 CO2 emissions (million tons): 14.7

2012-2021 emissions (million tons): 156

2012-2021 emissions ranking: 6

Retirement date: none

Lightstone Generation a joint venture of ArcLight Capital and the Blackstone Group bought Gavin from American Electric Power in 2016. Gavin’s electricity production and the emissions it creates has held relatively steady in the PJM Interconnection the gas-reliant wholesale electricity market encompassing much of the Mid-Atlantic and parts of the Midwest. Gavin posted a run time of 61 percent in 2021.

Earlier this year EPA denied Gavin’s application for an extension to keep operating coal ash ponds at the power plant (Greenwire Jan. 11). The ponds are used to store fly ash and sludge left over from burning coal in boilers. In a subsequent regulatory filing Gavin’s owners said they were moving to adopt a new method of handling coal ash to meet EPA’s regulations.

7. Oak Grove

Owner: Vistra Corp.

State: Texas

Capacity (megawatts): 1794

Began operations: 2010

2021 CO2 emissions (million tons): 13.8

2012-2021 emissions (million tons): 135

2012-2021 emissions ranking: 10

Retirement date: none

Oak Grove is the first of two relatively new coal plants to make this list. It is part of the last wave of coal plants built in the United States making it a baby compared with most American coal plants.

Its spot here reflects the steady nature of its power production and falling output from its older counterparts. In 2012 Oak Grove recorded emissions of 12.4 million tons making it the 27th-largest CO2 emitter in the country that year. Last year its 13.8 million tons of CO2 ranked seventh nationally.

8. Prairie State Energy Campus

Owner: nine public power companies

State: Illinois

Capacity (megawatts): 1776

Began operations: 2010

2021 CO2 emissions (million tons): 13.6

2012-2021 emissions (million tons): 113

2012-2021 emissions ranking: 23

Retirement date: Prairie State must be 100 percent carbon free by 2045 under Illinois law.

The other baby to make this list Prairie State could well be the last coal plant operating in Illinois. That’s because Illinois passed a law last year requiring all privately owned coal plants in the state to close by 2030 (Climatewire Dec. 7 2021). The law contains a carve-out for Prairie State which must reduce its emissions 45 percent by 2035 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2045. The plant is owned by a group of public power cooperatives.

The John E. Amos Power plant in West Virginia. | Tikilucas/Wikipedia

9. John Amos

Owner: American Electric Power

State: West Virginia

Capacity (megawatts): 2932

Began operations: 1971

2021 CO2 emissions (million tons): 12.6

2012-2021 emissions (million tons): 132

2012-2021 emissions ranking: 12

Retirement date: 2040

John Amos’ power generation rebounded slightly after 2020 when electricity demand was depressed due to Covid-19 lockdowns. Still the plant only ran 47 percent of the year in 2021 according to federal data. That helps explain John Amos’ emissions of 12.6 million tons last year which were less than the 13.2 million tons the plant averaged over the last decade.

John Amos has been at the center of a three-state controversy in recent years. Utility regulators in Kentucky and Virginia barred AEP from charging ratepayers to upgrade the facility’s wastewater system. That tab will now be picked up by West Virginia consumers (Energywire Oct. 14 2021).

10. Sam Seymour Power Plant (also known as Fayette Power Project)

Owner: Lower Colorado River Authority and Austin Energy

State: Texas

Capacity (megawatts): 1660

Began operations: 1979

2021 CO2 emissions (million tons): 12

2012-2021 emissions (million tons): 114

2012-2021 emissions ranking: 22

Retirement date: none.

Sam Seymour is not a regular in the top 10. The Texas power plant averaged annual emissions of about 11 million tons over the last decade. But as other coal plants have seen their power output decline a relatively normal year from Sam Seymour puts it among the top CO2 emitters in the nation.

Austin Energy had proposed retiring its share of two units this year but was unable to agree to a deal to do so with the Lower Colorado River Authority.

Notable omissions

A number of large emitters are notably absent from this year’s list.

Plant Scherer a Georgia coal plant emitted 177 million tons over the last decade the second most of any power plant in the country. But Scherer’s electricity generation has plunged in recent years prompting its emissions to also fall. The plant reported carbon emissions of roughly 10 million tons last year.

Two Florida utilities announced in 2020 that they would retire one of the plant’s four units this year (Energywire June 30 2020). Southern Co. which operates the plant and owns a stake in the plant’s three other units plans to retire another unit in 2028.

Scherer is not the only mega-emitter to fall out of the top 10. Another is Duke Energy’s Gibson Station in Indiana which recorded emissions of 156 million tons over the last 10 years. That was the fifth most of any power plant in the country. Duke’s current plans call for gradually phasing out the plant by 2035.

The last big emitter notably absent from the top 10 is Colstrip Generating Station in Montana which ranked ninth among power plant emitters over the last decade. Colstrip closed two of its smaller units in 2020 which has reduced its CO2 output somewhat. It nevertheless remains a larger emitter. Colstrip reported CO2 emissions of nearly 11 million tons in 2021 the 15th most in the country.

It was recently updated to 2045.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cmVwdWJsaWMuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMTY3NTA0L2VsZWN0cmljLWNhcnMtbWFkZS1pbi1hbWVyaWNh0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Making Electric Vehicle Parts in America Could Take Time,"“Some of these economic benefits need to happen domestically” he told me. “Politically it’s not sustainable to switch to technologies that are almost entirely produced abroad and need public money to be commercially attractive.” While the U.S. is still likely to import clean energy components from China for at least a decade he said “the more we do domestically the less upset we might be about the things that are coming in from abroad.”

Trying to protect the nascent domestic clean energy industry however could run up against international trade rules that the U.S. has had a heavy hand in crafting. One provision in the IRA—to give bonus credits for the purchase of electricity generated by domestically made wind turbines and solar panels—could run afoul of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement since it doesn’t also offer an exemption for free trade partners. The U.S. has recently raised complaints against Mexico under the same treaty arguing that state ownership in the Mexican energy sector unfairly disadvantages U.S. firms including clean energy companies. Already the European Union and South Korea—a leading battery producer—have raised alarms that E.V. tax credits in the IRA violate World Trade Organization rules barring discrimination against foreign producers.

“There’s a very clear double standard between the embrace of industrial policy and Buy America positions in the IRA and in the CHIPS Act [the $52 billion bill aimed at jump-starting semiconductor manufacturing] versus their continued attempts to impose the old neoliberal rules against those sorts of policies when it comes to other countries” said Tobita Chow director of Justice Is Global an organizing project focused on trade and industrial policy. “I don’t see how you can say that these sorts of policies are good when it comes to the U.S. but that they are unfair or a form of cheating when it’s Mexico or China or some other developing country doing it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ibG9vbWJlcmcuY29tL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAyMi0wOC0yMy9jYW4tdC1wYXktdXRpbGl0eS1iaWxscy0yMC1taWxsaW9uLXVzLWhvbWVzLWJlaGluZC1vbi1wYXltZW50cy1mYWNpbmctc2h1dG9mZnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can't Pay Utility Bills? 20 Million US Homes Behind on Payments Facing Shutoffs,"Why did this happen?

Brian Netzel who worked a decade for Amex until he was terminated in 2020 told FOX Business that he sued the company on behalf of himself and potentially thousands of other similarly situated employees following ""an avalanche of bad things coming to White people in that company once George Floyd was killed.""

The lawsuit alleges that amid the racial tensions roiling the U.S. in 2020 Amex implemented ""anti-racism"" policies throughout its corporate structure that ""gave preferential treatment to individuals for being Black and unambiguously signaled to White employees that their race was an impediment to getting ahead in the company.""

Netzel said such policies fostered a workplace rife with ""a tremendous amount of animosity"" in which White employees were unfairly punished or passed over for promotions while some Black employees were promoted merely to meet racial quotas and employees were encouraged to ""root out in McCarthy-era fashion people who didn't agree with this overall philosophy.""

AMERICAN EXPRESS ENGAGES IN ‘REVERSE DISCRIMINATION’ AGAINST WHITE PEOPLE CURRENT AND FORMER EMPLOYEES SAY

Netzel pinpointed the origin of such policies at the top recalling company town halls in which CEO Stephen Squeri reportedly engaged in ""what amounted to an emotional tirade against police against systemic racism in the U.S. and within American Express.""

""He made it clear that you needed to fight this with him or you needed to find another place to work"" Netzel said of Squeri who assumed his current position at the company in 2018.

Netzel maintained that this created an atmosphere in which White employees were treated disparately and forced to undergo trainings in which they were told to treat Black coworkers differently.

""We weren't allowed to talk before they talked in a meeting"" he said adding that they were explicitly advised against things such as touching Black people's hair as if it were a frequent occurrence. According to the lawsuit ""no admonishments were given to Black employees nor did the trainings direct Black employees on how they should conduct themselves around other races.""

Netzel also noted that Squeri was open about the company's intention to fill the company's leadership roles with more African Americans.

AMERICAN EXPRESS CRT TRAINING URGED STAFF TO ADOPT A HIERARCHY PUTTING ‘MARGINALIZED’ ABOVE ‘PRIVILEGED’

Netzel alleged in his complaint that his female manager who is Black would ""aggressively harass and berate White employees"" overworking them and retaliating with poor performance reviews. He also claims that Amex was aware of her behavior and that she was one of the executives who received financial incentives to reduce the number of White people in her department.

A spokesperson for Amex described Netzel's allegations as ""false and without merit"" telling FOX Business that the company has ""a longstanding commitment to living our company values which include fostering a diverse and inclusive culture where all colleagues can thrive.""

The spokesperson maintained that Amex provides no incentive for behaviors that discriminate against or favor any group of employees and also pushed back against any claim that advancement hiring and compensation at the company is based on anything other than individual qualifications business and leadership performance.

Netzel however believes Amex's policies are racist and he hopes his class action manages to convince the company to back off of them and apologize to the employees he says have been hurt.

""American Express has an opportunity to reverse their policies apologize and make the people that were harmed whole"" he reflected. ""Whether they'll do it is unknown. But if not then we're going to expose exactly what was done there through discovery and through trial and we're going to let a jury and ultimately consumers decide.""

The lawsuit's claims echo previous allegations of discrimination Amex has faced. In 2021 five current and former employees told FOX Business on condition of anonymity that the company engaged in ""reverse discrimination"" against White employees barring them from promotions and steeping the workplace in the tenets of critical race theory. Amex categorically denied the accusations at the time.

CRITICS SLAM AMERICAN EXPRESS CEO FOR ‘FUNDAMENTALLY RACIST’ WOKE POLICIES: ‘WE’RE COMING AFTER YOU'

According to internal documents reviewed in 2021 by Christopher F. Rufo a senior fellow at The Manhattan Institute Amex executives subjected employees to a CRT-based training program during which they were made to map their own intersectional identities and ""privilege"" based on ""race sexual orientation body type religion disability status age gender identity [and] citizenship."" They were then reportedly expected to adjust their behavior in the workplace based on their position in the intersectional hierarchy.

Netzel said he is in contact with other Amex employees who are fighting similar battles but he acknowledged that many fear the potential consequences of speaking out.

""The overall tone I think is that most people are just afraid to go up against American Express"" he said.

Netzel's attorney David Pivtorak told FOX Business that White employees have been treated like second-class citizens at Amex for several years.

""They’ve been subjected to seminars and trainings that labeled them as bigots denied opportunities due to the color of their skin and — to add insult to injury — punished and fired for asking to be treated equally"" he said adding that his firm filed the class action ""to deliver justice for these workers many of whom have been forced to choose between their principles and their livelihoods.""

""Once the truth about American Express’s virulent discrimination is exposed in court I have no doubt that it will be a clear warning to the rest of the country about the dangers of woke capitalism"" he added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8yNC9pbmRpYS1hbWVyaWNhbi1leHByZXNzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India lifts ban on American Express,"India has lifted business restrictions on American Express once again permitting the U.S. giant to onboard new customers in the South Asian market after the firm demonstrated “satisfactory compliance” with local data storage rules the local central bank said Wednesday.

In a series of moves last year the Reserve Bank of India indefinitely barred Mastercard American Express and Diners Club from issuing new debit credit or prepaid cards to customers over noncompliance with local data storage rules (PDF). The business restriction allowed the firms to continue to serve their existing customers in the country. India lifted the ban on Mastercard in June this year.

“In view of the satisfactory compliance demonstrated by American Express Banking Corp with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) circular… on Storage of Payment System Data the restrictions imposed… on onboarding of new domestic customers have been lifted with immediate effect” the central bank said in a statement.

Unveiled in 2018 the local data-storage rules require payments firms to store all Indian transaction data within servers in the country. Visa Mastercard and several other firms as well as the U.S. government previously requested New Delhi to reconsider its rules which they argued were designed to allow the regulator “unfettered supervisory access.”

“We welcome today’s decision by the Reserve Bank of India which enables American Express Network to onboard new customers effective immediately. India is a key strategic market for American Express and today’s decision is the result of our significant local investments in technology infrastructure and resources” said Sanjay Khanna interim CEO and COO of American Express in India in a statement.

“American Express’ ability to deliver best in class value and customer experiences will enable us to meet the increasing demand for premium products and services and grow our business in India.”

The resumption of American Express’ business in India should provide a boost to the local banks and fintechs that for over a year have been able to largely offer customers debit and credit cards powered by Visa and Rupay a homegrown card network that is promoted by the National Payments Corporation of India a special body of RBI.

The business restriction on the global cards giants took many banks by surprise last year. RBL Bank for instance scrambled to transition to Visa and took weeks to complete the process.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5lcmR3YWxsZXQuY29tL2FydGljbGUvdHJhdmVsL2FtZXgtbG91bmdlLWxhcy12ZWdhcy1jb252ZW50aW9uLWNlbnRlci1ndWlkZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Las Vegas Convention Center AmEx Lounge,"One of the best-known benefits of The Platinum Card® from American Express is Centurion Lounge access — which admits you into a luxurious world of free food and comfy seats at a handful of major airports. But one of the least-known and hardly-advertised benefits of that card is American Express Business Lounge Access. Terms apply.

There are currently two American Express Business Lounges in the world: one at the Las Vegas Convention Center and the other at Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City. Inside you’ll find complimentary snacks free Wi-Fi and myriad outlets to recharge your electronics — all in a place to recharge yourself with plentiful plush couches.

Your ticket in? Simply holding certain American Express cards. We headed inside the American Express Lounge at the Las Vegas Convention Center to learn everything you need to know about this customer benefit including what to expect and how to get in.

How to get into the AmEx lounge

Lounge access is complimentary for American Express customers who hold either a Business Card or a Corporate Card from American Express as well as those who hold either The Platinum Card® from American Express or the Centurion Card from American Express. Terms apply. Once inside you’ll have to flash your card as well as a government-issued ID card.

Guests are allowed too. Each cardmember can always bring up to one other guest with them. An American Express spokesperson said that up to two guests per cardholder would be admitted when space permits. (So three people total in your group are allowed on low-traffic days.) Children are welcome though a parent or legal guardian must be present with anyone under the age of 18.

As far as hours well they’re vague. The official word from AmEx is that the lounge is open “during busy days at select conferences and trade shows.” A spokesperson from American Express clarified to NerdWallet that the lounge operates during show hours which are typically 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. If there are multiple shows running at the same time the lounge would open when the earliest show’s trade show floor opens and close when the floor closes for the latest show.

So there’s hope that hours could be extended during the biggest Vegas events. But on days when there's nothing going on the lounge might be closed.

What to expect inside the AmEx lounge

The American Express Lounge is a sort of antithesis of your standard trade show or conference. It’s roughly 3500 square feet of relative calm with an abundance of power outlets and free coffee.

Instead of being accosted by exhibitors trying to shove yet another free keychain in your swag-filled hands you’ll be gently offered a drink or snack served in an individually packaged bag for you to eat there or save for later.

When we visited the snack bag had a small assortment consisting of chocolate sandwich cookies pretzel sticks dried bananas and malt balls.

There’s a station to grab beverages including tea and sparkling water. There’s also one of those automatic espresso machines that’ll make you a latte or cappuccino.

Beverages are fairly simple limited mostly to teas coffee drinks and sparkling water. (Photo by Sally French)

As far as setup goes there’s plenty of couch seating. When you’re exhausted from networking with people you might opt to zone out and watch TV.

If you’ve got work to do bring your laptop as there are plenty of outlets. Pre-pandemic the lounge offered guests free use of wireless printers and laptops. Those never returned when the lounge reopened after shutting down at the start of the pandemic but a spokesperson for American Express told NerdWallet that those amenities would return again soon (though did not specify a date).

Coffee drinks and outlets are plentiful. (Photo by Sally French)

Perhaps most delightful though is the lounge's free Wi–Fi. Sure free Wi-Fi is the norm almost everywhere these days — but Las Vegas is no normal place.

While there is free Wi-Fi in some spots of the Las Vegas Convention Center it’s mostly limited to lobby and registration areas. For free Wi-Fi throughout you’ll have to pay up.

During a visit to the Las Vegas Convention Center in July here were the Wi-Fi options:

That’s no typo. That’s $80 for one day of Internet access.

While the free American Express Lounge Wi-Fi will only help you while you're in the lounge (it won’t work out on the show floor) people needing Wi-Fi will almost certainly prefer to duck into the lounge to access the Internet than to pay $80 for it throughout the convention center.

How to find the American Express Lounge at the Las Vegas Convention Center

The lounge is located on Las Vegas Convention Center property and is tough to miss as it’s situated at the main entrance of Central Hall just off of Convention Center Drive.

(Map courtesy of American Express)

That said the convention center is huge and Central Hall might be more than a short stroll depending on where you’re coming from — especially if you’re wearing your fancy (and uncomfortable) business shoes and it’s triple-digit temperatures.

For those of you who aren’t trying to get some cardio in mid-conference just to get some free snacks and a coffee try the Tesla tunnel.

Riders can get to the lounge by taking the LVCC Loop. (Photo by Sally French)

Officially dubbed the Las Vegas Convention Center Loop the tunnel was built by The Boring Company which was founded by Elon Musk. The only traffic inside is a series of Tesla cars that drive you through the tunnel. The tunnel has a few stops including Resorts World (which is Hilton-owned and one of the newer hotels on the Las Vegas Strip).

In addition to the Resorts World stop on the west side of the convention center there’s also a stop on the south side. From the West Hall which is one of the newer parts of the convention center having opened in 2021 it can take about 25 minutes to walk to the American Express Lounge.

Or you can hop in a car (there’s usually no wait) and tell your driver that you’re headed to the Central station. Soak up that Tesla ambience quickly as the journey from West Hall to the lounge takes roughly two minutes.

The lounge is also just a couple hundred feet from the Convention Center Monorail Station which connects the convention center with the Las Vegas Strip. It runs as far north as the Sahara Las Vegas and as far south as the MGM Grand with stops along the way that include the LINQ.

Monorail tickets are $5 per ride or $13 for a one-day pass.

How AmEx Centurion Lounges compare

When most people think of AmEx lounges the luxurious airport lounges (dubbed Centurion Lounges) likely come to mind. There are a few ways to gain entry to these lounges but it’s most common to get in by holding The Platinum Card® from American Express. Terms apply.

These oases are known for offering civility that contrasts with the hectic nature of airports. Instead of overpriced airport food you’ll dine on a chef-curated buffet entirely for free (though of course you did pay $695 for the card’s annual fee).

In lieu of a firm oddly-inclined seat certainly not designed for a human you’re afforded a plush armchair or perhaps a desk. Some even offer sweet amenities such as video games foosball tables spa treatments showers and Peloton bikes.

The convention center lounges are far simpler — and far fewer. While there are more than a dozen Centurion Lounges in airports around the world there are only two convention center lounges.

Besides the Vegas outpost there's one at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City tucked past the Starbucks at the 11th Ave entrance on the 4E Terrace.

At the convention center lounges the refreshment options are limited and there’s no Peloton to get your sweat on. But if you need Wi-Fi and you just want a quick replenishment of your glucose stores or a jolt of caffeine before you slug through another networking session having an AmEx lounge in the convention center might be your saving grace.

Compared to the $200 airline incidental credits the $15 monthly Uber credits the Clear membership credits and everything else that comes with holding The Platinum Card® from American Express this lounge is unlikely to be one of the top perks of card ownership.

But it can certainly be a nice addition to the dozens of benefits of The Platinum Card® from American Express. Terms apply.

And hey once you’ve conferenced until you can conference no more you’ll likely head off to Las Vegas’ McCarran International Airport. And once there — assuming you hold The Platinum Card® from American Express — you can swipe yourself into the Centurion Lounge too.

The complaint filed by Brian Netzel who worked at Amex for a decade until he was terminated in 2020 alleges the company began incentivizing executives via their end of the year bonuses to decrease the percentage of white employees in their departments under the direction of CEO Stephen Squeri.

Prior to Squeri coming on board as CEO in 2018 Netzel claims the hiring practices at the company were transparent and based on merit. Netzel alleges that changed dramatically once Squeri came aboard especially following the murder of George Floyd in May 2020.

According to the complaint Floyd's murder spurred even more ""aggressive and overt"" tactics.

Those who were unwilling to make employment decisions based purely on race rather than merit were lambasted punished and even terminated""

After Amex's announcement of its ""anti-racism initiative"" following Floyd's death the company's entire outward focus became how they could best cater to black customers and employees Netzel claims.



The initiative coincided with new policies ""meant to create discomfort in white employees because of their race"" according to the complaint. One was a ""Stasi-like"" policy according to Netzel urging people at the company to anonymously report their co-workers for violations of the new rules.

Netzel and his attorneys also chronicled the story of an executive who explicitly told directors in his department ""we are only hiring black people from now on"" and who reprimanded one of his hiring managers for bringing on someone who was white.

This situation and many like it played out throughout the company"" Netzel's complaint reads. ""In recent mass layoffs the burden was disproportionately felt by white employees where in some teams the only individuals who were not let go were black.""

The complaint also said Amex reiterated its discriminatory policies through race-based trainings and messaging to employees and that favorable treatment towards black customers and employees was evident.

The work-life culture at Amex began to get ""toxic"" as a result according to Netzel and based on his ""information and belief"" hundreds of white employees had been terminated or forced to leave ""because they could not tolerate the racially repressive environment"" the complaint alleged.

Kenny Xu president of Color Us United has argued American Express is making a concerted effort to implement “woke racial preferences” according to  backing up Netzel's claims. Xu's group is circulating a to challenge American Express's ""harmful"" and ""divisive"" race-based policies.

American Express allegedly gave preferential contracts to suppliers just because the heads of those companies happen to be Black the petition claims.

In a statement to The National Desk (TND) an American Express spokesperson said the allegations in the lawsuit are ""false and without merit.""

""We have a longstanding commitment to living our company values which include fostering a diverse and inclusive culture where all colleagues can thrive. Advancement hiring and compensation within our company is based solely on individual qualifications business and leadership performance. Any claim to the contrary is wrong and we do not provide any incentive for behaviors that discriminate against or favor any group of employees"" the Amex spokesperson told TND."
AIG,American International Group,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpZy5jb20vaG9tZS9uZXdzcm9vbS9zdG9yaWVzL3ByZXBhcmluZy1idXNpbmVzcy1sZWFkZXJzLWZvci10b21vcnJvd3MtZ2xvYmFsLXJpc2tz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Preparing business leaders for tomorrow’s global risks,"When AIG’s Paul Greensmith started his career in insurance 25 years ago the risks businesses faced looked far different than they do today.



And in many ways Paul notes companies are operating in a far riskier world:

“If you think back on the risk landscape for a typical large- to medium-sized business the issues would have been around very traditional types of risks related to product liability and welfare of workers” says Paul recalling his days as an insurance policy underwriter.

“If you ask CEOs or risk managers today what their biggest concerns are they’ll talk about the impacts of climate change ESG cyber risks supply chains or political risks.”

Such risks are increasingly interrelated and are likely to continue to evolve Paul adds.

As Head of AIG’s Global Specialty Insurance business Paul is leading strategies to develop insurance products aimed at helping business leaders manage evolving risks covering unique events. Whether helping clients think through challenges amid a global crisis or providing importers/exporters with ways to mitigate risks as they navigate supply chain disruptions AIG has the capabilities and expertise to support brokers and clients in virtually every part of the world.

“AIG’s global footprint is what differentiates us in the insurance market” Paul adds.

“We have the ability to manage and write complex global insurance programs helping clients and business partners manage local regulations premium collection payment of claims and other uncertainties they may face.”

Anticipating evolving risks

AIG is also thinking ahead about the needs of brokers and clients designing insurance products to help them manage new and emerging risks.

This includes for example risks that some energy industry leaders anticipate particularly as more investors prioritize environmental social and governance-related business principles.

Paul notes that as more global energy companies consider transitioning away from fossil-based systems of energy production and consumption they will also need to address the risks involved in the complex processes of decommissioning power stations plants facilities and other infrastructure.

As a result AIG is working with energy clients as well as third-party energy experts to develop insurance products designed to support their transition to different energy sources.

“This goes beyond writing extra coverage onto an insurance product” Paul says. “We are strategically thinking about ways AIG can grow and support our brokers and clients for years to come.”

Prioritizing ease of doing business

For Paul a key priority is to make it easier for brokers and clients to do business with AIG’s Specialty Insurance experts.

This takes clear communication which involves listening to the needs and challenges of brokers and clients and having conversations with them early on about the types of risks that AIG is willing and able to help manage.

“Our goal is to be responsive and solutions-oriented.”

Paul underscores the importance of empowering brokers and clients to make thoughtful decisions so AIG’s Global Specialty team devotes significant time to speaking with them about their exposures and ways to mitigate or transfer their risk.

For example AIG’s underwriters are encouraged to deepen relationships with brokers and clients – many of whom are eager to understand how insurers arrive at certain policy decisions including limits on coverage and premiums.

“This doesn’t mean we say ‘yes’ to every single deal that comes through our door but what it does mean is that when business comes our way brokers and clients have access to our risk experts to help them make the right business decisions for their organization.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNlcGFsLm9yZy9lbi9ldmVudHMvc2VsZWN0aW9uLWFjdGl2aXRpZXMtY2FycmllZC1vdXQtbWVtYmVycy1yZWdpb25hbC1ncm91cC1leHBlcnRzLXdhdGVyLXJlc291cmNlcy1sYXRpbi0w0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Selection of activities carried out by the members of the Regional Group of Experts on Water Resources of Latin ...,"The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is supporting the organization of the first regional workshop for Latin America and the Caribbean of the Subnational Climate Finance Initiative (SCF) under the title “Invest in Sustainable Subnational Solutions for Climate nature and people

The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) report entitled The State of the Climate in Latin America and the Caribbean 2021 highlights its profound repercussions on ecosystems food and water security people's health and the fight against poverty. The report was presented on July 22 2022 within the framework of a regional technical conference for South American countries organized by the WMO in Cartagena (Colombia).

“The report shows that unfortunately hydrometeorological hazards - such as droughts heat waves cold waves tropical cyclones and floods - have caused the loss of hundreds of lives caused serious damage to agricultural production and infrastructure and have caused population displacement. ” said WMO Secretary-General Professor Petteri Taalas.

“Sea level rise and continued warming of the oceans are projected to continue to affect livelihoods tourism health food energy and water security in coastal areas particularly in coastal areas of small islands and the countries of Central America. For many Andean cities the melting of glaciers represents the loss of an important source of freshwater currently used for domestic use irrigation and hydroelectric power generation. In South America the continued degradation of the Amazon rainforest remains a major concern for both the region and the global climate given the role that this type of forest plays in the carbon cycle"" explained Professor Taalas.

You see the curve of the taillight matches the curve of the tank matches the curve of the front fender matches the curve of the bikini fairing matches the curve of the tailpipe. That’s art.”

In 2021 when visiting his daughter who lives in the Hill Country Massie decided to buy a historic building in the heart of Johnson City that had been a showroom for Model A Fords in the 1930s. After moving from the Woodlands Massie opened the Texas Vintage Motorcycle Museum in the spring of 2022 to pay tribute to the art of the vehicle. Now his 81-piece collection of beauties is on display for people to admire and fantasize about the freedom of life on two wheels.

For Massie his love for motorcycles helped him survive what may be the hardest loss of all: the death of a child. After his son Hunter died in 2021—just three years after the death of his wife Barbara—Massie grappled with depression. “Have you ever heard of a long dark night of the soul?” he asked. “That’s where I was.” But a lifelong passion for riding collecting restoring and customizing vintage motorcycles—a perfect metaphor for boldly moving forward—helped him get off the couch sell his suburban Houston home and move to Johnson City.

“I think it goes back to resiliency” Massie explained. “If you’ve had experiences where you’ve struggled and survived it gives you the guts to try it again. And this was a gutsy move. I had to shoot from the hip and make all kinds of decisions and trust myself and have faith that things will work out. And so far so good.”

These are not new themes for Massie. In 1985 when he was in his early 30s Massie was hired by American General Corp. an insurance and financial services business where he worked his way up to executive vice president managing billions of dollars in high-yield bonds. When American International Group bought AGC in 2001 Massie discovered inaccuracies and malfeasance hidden in their books. Digging deep to figure out the best path forward given what he knew Massie decided to expose the fraud a choice that resulted in professional ostracism—he lost his job and eventually won a legal settlement. In 2010 he published The Whistleblower’s Dilemma a lively read on the risks and rewards of calling out corruption. The book which has been taught in business schools reveals how the ethics that guided Massie link back to wisdom offered from his father who advised Massie when he faced a tough choice as a teenager at his first job working at a gas station.

It was the first time that an influence campaign pushing U.S. interests abroad had been discovered and taken down from the social media platforms. The operation which ran for almost five years on eight social networks and messaging apps promoted the views values and goals of the United States while attacking the interests of Russia China Iran and other countries the researchers found.

The accounts behind the operation often posed as news outlets or took on the personas of people who didn’t exist posting content in at least seven languages including Russian Arabic and Urdu. The posts criticized countries like Russia for engaging in “imperialist wars” in Syria and Africa while praising American aid efforts in Central Asia and Iraq.

Meta which owns Facebook Instagram and WhatsApp said the “country of origin” of the accounts was the United States while Twitter said the “presumptive countries of origin” for the accounts were the United States and Britain according to the report."

It’s young – just about 6 years old – and it’s building its assets from scratch.

Privately held the company boasts more than 2500 assets built and under its management across the U.S.

Earlier this year Suruchi Ahuja 35 was appointed CEO after having served as CFO since the company was established in 2016. Tillman Infrastructure is a subsidiary of Tillman Global Holdings which was founded by her father Sanjiv Ahuja a former CEO of Orange and LightSquared.

In early August global investment firm Carlyle announced that funds managed by its global infrastructure platform committed up to $1 billion to partner with Tillman Global Holdings to accelerate its investments in Tillman Infrastructure.

Ambitious buildout plans

Tillman Infrastructure is ambitious: It plans to double its nationwide footprint over the next couple of years.

A big part of Tillman Infrastructure’s focus is providing long-term sustainable infrastructure to mobile operators in the most cost-effective way and it’s particularly focused on rural and suburban America where there’s a ton of white space still left to be covered and densified she said.

“We’re actually really unique in the market in that we are an organic growth story” she said. “We have built all of our assets in the last six years. We build entirely on order we don’t build on specs so we partner with mobile operators” as well as wireless internet service providers (WISPs) and regional carriers. “We are the most prolific builder of new macro tower assets in the country today.”

Tillman works with all the major U.S. service providers – AT&T T-Mobile and Verizon – and it’s been a partner to Dish Network as well over the past 18 months or so. “We’re seeing a big focus on network expansion from all of our partners” she said.

Bridging the digital divide is a big part of it. “We build for a variety of reasons” she said including where carriers have no coverage as well as areas where they have assets but want to densify.

How much is driven by C-band? “It is definitely a driver of the work that we’re doing but really every site can have a variety of reasons that the carriers need coverage” she said. In some cases the existing assets are overloaded and they need to augment them.

New kid on the block

American Tower Crown Castle and SBA Communications are the big three publicly traded tower companies in the U.S.

What’s it like coming in as the new kid on the tower block? The U.S. is home to one of the most mature tower industries in the world and she gives credit where due to the larger established companies that have been at it for several decades now.

It helps that Tillman Infrastructure has a lot of seasoned executives with industry experience she said. The former CEO Bill Hague is now vice chairman; he previously was with AT&T and before that held positions at Pacific Northwest Cellular/Western Wireless Communications.

It also doesn’t hurt that it’s bringing a slightly different take on the business model which is “how do we provide our customers with a fair transparent and long-term solution” she said. “We really came with a partnership approach” and a long-term view that includes making sure carriers have enough space on structures in case future equipment gets larger or heavier.

The company says on its website that it doesn’t require costly amendments for equipment changes and doesn’t charge administrative fees when carriers swap out equipment.

“We really focus on future-proofing both the physical and the financial business model so that the customers have a solution that works for them over the coming decades” she said.

It’s certainly not an easy market to break into she acknowledged. But they entered the market at what looks to have been the right time. “We’ve been excited about it” she said. “I love this business.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9uYXRpb25hbC1zZWN1cml0eS8yMDIyLzA4LzI0L2thYnVsLWFpcnBvcnQtYm9tYmluZy1hZmdoYW5pc3Rhbi1ldmFjdWF0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,For U.S. troops who survived Kabul airport disaster guilt and grief endure,"The U.S. military’s treacherous evacuation of Afghanistan continues to haunt those who were there

From a guard tower overlooking Kabul’s airport two U.S. Marines spotted a man matching the description of a suspected suicide bomber. They radioed their commanders: “Do we have permission to engage?” Request denied one of the Marines Sgt. Tyler Vargas-Andrews recalled being told. Too many civilians nearby. The man vanished from view among a crush of people clamoring outside the airport’s Abbey Gate he said. It was Aug. 26 2021. Hours later an explosion ripped through the crowd killing an estimated 170 Afghans along with 13 U.S. troops.

Vargas-Andrews contends that “unfortunately a lot of people died” because he was directed to stand down. “That’s a hard thing to deal with” he said. “You know that’s something that honestly eats at me every single day.”

The 24-year-old from Folsom Calif. climbed down from the tower a short time before the explosion went off and suffered catastrophic wounds in the blast. He has undergone 43 surgeries since losing his right arm left leg left kidney and parts of his intestines and colon. At least 15 metal fragments remain embedded in his body he said silent reminders of the day he almost died.

It’s unclear if the bombing at Abbey Gate could have been averted. The event was a low point in the United States’ exit from Afghanistan and the treacherous operation that began when Taliban foot soldiers swept into the capital 11 days prior. For the American military personnel involved much of their experience throughout those two weeks is still coming into focus now a year later as they process the suffering they witnessed and cope with lasting feelings of anger guilt and grief.

This account of the deployment and the attack carried out by an Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan is based on interviews with 14 service members involved including the top military commander who planned and directed the operation.

As part of this project The Washington Post produced a companion episode of its podcast “Post Reports” where listeners will hear directly from the U.S. troops who shared their recollections of these events. In blunt often visceral detail those who survived the final days of America’s longest war made clear that what endures is an incalculable sense of loss.

The commander Marine Gen. Kenneth “Frank” McKenzie said that he too continues to process what occurred and regrets both the Abbey Gate bombing and a drone strike U.S. forces carried out three days later near the airport killing 10 civilians. U.S. troops involved mistakenly believed they were targeting another suicide bomber the Pentagon later concluded.

“We all feel bitterly what happened at the end” the general said.

Heart-pounding and heartbreaking

Nearly 6000 U.S. service members were dispatched to Afghanistan as Kabul fell in what would be the greatest test of the Pentagon’s emergency-evacuation planning since the Vietnam War’s devastating conclusion decades earlier. Nearly 125000 people were rescued over 17 days. But tens of thousands more were stranded many with no clear path to be reunited with family in the United States.

For many of the troops rushed to Hamid Karzai International Airport — named for Afghanistan’s first leader after U.S. forces ousted the Taliban from power as vengeance for quartering the terrorist group responsible for 9/11 — it was their first taste of a war that after nearly 20 years already was lost.

The sudden crisis undercut President Biden’s promise of a “safe and orderly” withdrawal and prompted McKenzie to cut a deal with the Taliban in which coalition troops controlled Kabul’s airport while America’s longtime battlefield adversary pledged to maintain order outside.

U.S. personnel involved in the mission said the arrangement was exasperating with militants beating and executing Afghans as they approached the airport. McKenzie described it as a strained but transactional relationship that provided U.S. troops with a measure of security from the Islamic State which also is in conflict with the Taliban.

A Defense Department review of the operation first detailed by The Post in February exposed sharp disagreements within the U.S. government over how to carry out the withdrawal. State Department officials wanted to keep the U.S. Embassy in Kabul open as long as possible frustrating the military brass who wanted to begin the evacuation of American citizens and Afghan allies sooner.

Top commanders including McKenzie had advised Biden against withdrawing all U.S. forces from Afghanistan preferring to keep a force of about 2500 in place that would be reinforced by a similar number of coalition troops and backed by air power. But when the president announced in April 2021 that he wanted the military out by that September the Pentagon began preparing for an evacuation.

A few hundred soldiers from the Army’s 10th Mountain Division were positioned at the airport in spring of 2021 to maintain security in Kabul. They were intended to be a safety net as the administration leery of Taliban gains elsewhere had hoped to retain a diplomatic presence after the military withdrawal was complete.

The Afghan government’s collapse on Aug. 15 triggered mass panic leading tens of thousands of Afghans many of them American allies who aided the war effort to rush the airport. First Sgt. Andrew Kelly of the 10th Mountain Division said his unit tried but failed to prevent the chaos that unfolded as people desperate to flee swarmed the flight line and attempted to reach any aircraft they could find.

In the hysteria Kelly and other U.S. soldiers responded to a report of gunshots at a traffic circle outside the airport’s commercial terminal. As civilians scrambled for cover a firefight broke out when gunmen brandished weapons at the Americans. U.S. soldiers killed three of them and wounded a fourth.

The small contingent of U.S. troops linked arm-in-arm at times attempted to hold back the masses. But the determined civilians broke through with some boarding parked C-17 cargo planes without permission and others climbing onto the outside of aircraft before takeoff only to fall to their death moments later.

“That’s how desperate they were to get out of there” said Army 1st Lt. Timothy Williams. “It was one of those defining moments I think for everybody where it was just like ‘Wow this is terrible.’ ”

As C-17s carrying American reinforcements touched down Marines and soldiers were assigned to secure the airport’s gates and to assess search and admit evacuees. It was heart-pounding often heartbreaking work.

Among the units instructed to reopen Abbey Gate was the 1st Platoon of Ghost Company 2nd Battalion 1st Marines. Comprising less than 45 troops it had been in Jordan serving as part of a crisis-response force when commanders ordered their departure for Kabul. The group was tightknit and had been training for months said Gunnery Sgt. Jonathan Eby the platoon sergeant.

Eby a 17-year Marine with previous experience in Iraq and Afghanistan said they formed a line and surged toward the crowd trying to move people backward. There was a writhing anxious energy he said likening the crowd to a mosh pit.

“I would compare it to whatever Leonidas and his Spartans felt like trying to hold back all those people” Eby said referring to the ancient Greek king and his warriors who were vastly outnumbered in a famous battle depicted in the movie “300.”

In the ensuing days the Marines maintained a barricade at the gate adjacent to a fetid drainage canal along the facility’s southeastern edge. Many Afghans figured out that wading through the filth was the easiest way to bypass the crowd. Those flashing the requisite paperwork were hoisted to safety. U.S. troops carried out similar work at other entry points.

Teams of U.S. service women formed on the fly in preparation for the evacuation supplemented the mission by searching women and assisting children hundreds of whom had reached the airport without any parent or guardian or wound up separated along the way.

Warrant Officer Sasha Savage who led a team of eight women said the effort never truly found a rhythm but they assisted who they could. Photographs of her teammates caring for babies went viral online. It was clear that the evacuees were “going through the hardest time of their life” arriving dehydrated bloody or scared because their families had been separated in the mayhem she said.

“It feels like you’re making impact at that point” Savage said.

To get around the airport U.S. troops hot-wired baggage carts forklifts and other vehicles. They pilfered tools found in shipping containers figuring they might prove useful. Vargas-Andrews grabbed a pair of 18-inch bolt cutters.

At Abbey Gate he and his scout-sniper teammates took turns scanning the crowd from the guard tower. Several times he said Marines interfacing with those hoping to flee retreated into the base of the tower to cry. The Taliban were posted at checkpoints just yards away and watching them act so ruthlessly made it difficult to maintain restraint.

Vargas-Andrews recalled that after a few days of observing Taliban abuses he crept closer to their checkpoints to photograph corpses nearby — people the militants had killed he surmised. He relayed the images to commanders he said but understood there would be no recourse.

“If we start firing at them they’re going to start firing at us. Do we want to get in that scenario?” he said. “I get it. But it’s a hard thing.”

A flash and then ‘Boom’

Fire from the explosion swallowed the tightly packed corridor outside Abbey Gate ejecting ball bearings that cut down those closest to the epicenter and left a gruesome path of carnage. U.S. personnel manning the gate had been warned that a suicide bomber was likely to be nearby but they had not received orders to suspend operations.

Asked about Vargas-Andrews’s contention that the bomber could have been killed before the explosion McKenzie said that no request to do so reached his level or surfaced during a military investigation of the incident that included testimony from more than 100 U.S. personnel. Vargas-Andrews said he was never interviewed as part of that inquiry as he underwent numerous surgeries.

Eby who also was at Abbey Gate when the bomb exploded said that there was a “known threat” in the area but he was unaware of any service member identifying the bomber. “All that was ever said was ‘Look for a black bag’ ” Eby said.

Shortly before the blast Vargas-Andrews had climbed down from the tower to help people into the airport. He recalls seeing a flash. And then “Boom — this massive wave of pressure just hit me” he said.

“The next time I opened my eyes I’m on the ground” Vargas-Andrews recalled. To his left a sea of people were down and lifeless.

The military investigation released earlier this year determined the loss of life from the bombing was from a single catastrophic explosion. Some dispute that though. Multiple personnel posted at Abbey Gate said they heard gunfire as well — and that they shot back.

Vargas-Andrews and others with him at the time remain convinced the bombing was part of a complex attack. As he lay in the dirt his arm and leg shredded the sound of gunfire crackling overhead urged him to seek cover he said. There was a hole in the fence line about 70 yards away but his wounds made it impossible to drag himself there.

Investigators concluded that gunfire was sporadic and that those believing otherwise may have been disorientated by the explosion.

Those unharmed — or not incapacitated — scrambled to save as many lives as possible.

Among them was Marine Sgt. Wyatt Wilson who sustained grievous shrapnel wounds in the blast and was thrown off his feet by its force. Despite his injuries he tried to drag another severely wounded Marine to safety but he had lost too much blood. The woman Wilson tried to help Cpl. Kelsee Lainhart was left paralyzed by the explosion.

Teammates of Vargas-Andrews knew he was in trouble after the blast. Sgt. Charles Schilling a close friend raced to him screaming Vargas-Andrews’s name repeatedly. Using the bolt cutters his friend had commandeered Schilling ripped open a hole in the fence to shorten the distance they’d need to traverse for medical care. The injured were whisked away on any vehicle available.

“Patients kept coming in five six at a time” said Capt. Carlos Mendoza an Air Force flight nurse who was working at the airport’s hospital a few miles from the blast site. “It just didn’t stop.”

The wounded were splayed out on the floor waiting for care as doctors triaged them. Mendoza recalled encountering one service member who had died and another who was mortally wounded. Chaplains arrived and administered last rites.

A doctor split open the chest of one Marine using a pair of scissors as they searched for interior bleeding and then rushed him to surgery Mendoza said.

“I heard that he survived” he added though he is unsure.

Thirty-seven Marines were awarded Purple Hearts for injuries sustained in the attack said Maj. Jordan Cochran a spokesman. More than 300 received ribbons stipulating that they engaged in direct combat over the course of the evacuation.

In the Army at least four soldiers have received Purple Hearts for injuries suffered in the evacuation said Maj. Jackie Wren a service spokeswoman. Nearly 330 soldiers were recognized for experiencing combat during those weeks.

About 45 U.S. troops were wounded in the bombing and survived the Pentagon said. The Americans killed:

Marine Lance Cpl. David Espinoza 20.

Marine Sgt. Nicole Gee 23.

Marine Staff Sgt. Darin Taylor Hoover 31.

Army Staff Sgt. Ryan Knauss 23.

The recovery

McKenzie the commanding general retired in April. He marvels at the courage and professionalism rank-and-file troops showed during the evacuation and said his greatest fear was a bomber sneaking onto a plane and detonating in the air killing hundreds of people.

Service members reflecting on the operation should “decouple their actions and their enormous courage on the ground” from decisions made by more senior U.S. officials that put them there he said.

“If you’re going to bring people in you have to search them” he said. “You’ve got to be confident that you’re not going to let someone with an explosive device get on an airplane because that is the point of greatest vulnerability.”

Eby the platoon sergeant lost nine men in his unit all 23 or younger. During an interview last month at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina he paused several times to regain composure while recounting stories about the fallen. He considers the surviving members of the platoon to be family.

“We are inseparable” he said. “I still get called ‘Dad’ by most of them.”

Savage who led a female search team wears a black metal bracelet engraved with Gee’s name. The weightlifting enthusiast had been meritoriously promoted and was among the Marines pictured caring for Afghan children.

“She had a certain light and happiness about her that would make things positive no matter the situation” Savage said.

Vargas-Andrews said he hopes the military enhances its recognition of those who saved his life and the lives of others. He singled out Schilling who tore open the fence and Hospitalman 3rd Class Jorge Mayo who raced among the blast victims and treated Vargas-Andrews.

A memory from a few days before the explosion sticks with the Marine as he continues physical therapy at Walter Reed National Military Medical outside Washington. In the crowd at Abbey Gate he spotted a sobbing girl in tattered clothes maybe 8 years old. She held an infant in one arm and the hand of a boy about 4 years old in her other hand. The baby wasn’t breathing.

Vargas-Andrews said he hustled the infant who was turning blue to an Air Force medic and they resuscitated the baby. But the girl continued to cry.

He scrambled to a higher perch on top of a vehicle and spotted a man with his head in his hands. It was the children’s father. The man had paperwork needed to evacuate but had been separated from his children in the melee. Their family was reunited moments later.

Vargas-Andrews said the moment was “huge for me” his voice thickening with emotion as he recalled it.

“I look at my injuries every day” he said. “And that one family they have a life now. And that’s something that won’t be taken away from them.”

He shifted his weight in his chair a prosthetic leg beneath him.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmNpbm5hdGkuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyMi8wOC8yMy9jYXJldy10b3dlci1pbi1jaW5jaW5uYXRpLXNvbGQvNjU0MTU1NzgwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carew Tower in Cincinnati sold,"CORRECTION: The Carew Tower and attached hotel now called the Hilton Cincinnati Netherland Plaza were built together at a cost of more than $30 million not the office tower alone.

After months of delays Downtown's landmark Carew Tower has been sold.

Greg Power who owns the iconic 49-story office-and-retail tower at 441 Vine St. first told a bankruptcy judge in March that he had entered into a purchase-and-sale agreement with a new owner that would resolve all the issues in the foreclosure lawsuit filed against him and his company Carew Realty Inc. in October 2021 The Enquirer reported.

Power was facing foreclosure for defaulting on a $9.7 million loan according to court documents and owed hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid utility bills.

Who bought Carew Tower Cincinnati?

The sale of the office tower was originally set to close in April but Power asked Hamilton County Common Pleas Court Judge Tom Heekin to extend the deadline for responding to a foreclosure lawsuit more than a half dozen times including his last request for an extension through Aug. 15.

The property finally sold on Aug. 18 for $18 million to an affiliate of New York-based Veles Partners LLC according to Hamilton County property records.

What's next for Carew Tower?

It's not clear what's next for the tower which was once the tallest building west of the Alleghenies. Veles officials could not be reached for comment.

Workers began construction of the Carew Tower and the old Netherland Plaza Hotel which is connected to the office tower just before the Great Depression and completed it in 1930 at a cost of more than $30 million − more than $500 million in today's dollars.

The hotel also owned by Power and now called the Hilton Cincinnati Netherland Plaza was not part of the foreclosure filing or sale.

It was celebrated for its art deco architecture and it was added to the register of National Historic Landmarks in 1994.

In 2010 Carew Tower was displaced as the city's tallest building by Great American Tower at Queen City Square which has eight fewer floors but is 86 feet taller than the 574-foot Carew Tower thanks to its spire.

Power who acquired the building in 2014 could not be reached for comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3RlbGVjb20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2hpZ2hsaW5lLXdpbnMtYnJhemlsaWFuLXRlbGVjb20tb2ktdG93ZXItYXVjdGlvbi13aXRoLTMzMC1taWxsaW9uLWJpZC85MzczMzgwMtIBhAFodHRwczovL3RlbGVjb20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9oaWdobGluZS13aW5zLWJyYXppbGlhbi10ZWxlY29tLW9pLXRvd2VyLWF1Y3Rpb24td2l0aC0zMzAtbWlsbGlvbi1iaWQvOTM3MzM4MDI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Highline wins Brazilian telecom Oi tower auction with $330 million bid,"Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals Subscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.

Camden-based American Water launched its charitable arm in 2010 to support the communities it serves.

In that vein the American Water Charitable Foundation announced Aug. 23 that it had awarded a total of $1.5 million to 36 organizations in 12 states including New Jersey as part of its 2022 Water and Environment grant program.

The New Jersey recipients are:

Girls Inc. of Greater Philadelphia and Southern New Jersey which received $20000 to support an environmental science afterschool program for Camden City girls ages 9 through 11.

Woodford Cedar Run Wildlife Refuge which received $10000 to support water resource education materials and models for New Jersey youth.

Participating in an Aug. 23 press conference to celebrate the awards were Carrie Williams president of the foundation; Dena Herrin executive director Girls Inc. of Greater Philadelphia and Southern New Jersey; Darren Spielman executive director of Pennsylvania Resources Council; Mike O’Malley executive director Woodford Cedar Run Wildlife Refuge; Erin Kiefer-Rounds director of education Woodford Cedar Run; and a unique guest — “wildlife ambassador” Aldora a red-tailed hawk.

“The American Water Charitable Foundation is pleased to partner with organizations across American Water’s footprint to provide equitable and accessible projects and programs focused on clean water conservation environmental education and water-based recreation” Williams said in a statement. “The Water and the Environment grant program gives us the opportunity to continue to focus on our core passion of water while engaging community members in learning how every drop counts.”

The grant is part of the Keep Communities Flowing program which focuses on three pillars of giving: Water People and Communities. The $1.5 million will support projects and initiatives that further the company’s commitment to the environment social and governance issues as well as inclusion diversity and equity.

That couldn't be further from the truth.

Water has always been part of African life.

Paul Best a historical consultant for the Independence Seaport Museum in Philadelphia says water was part of African rituals and religions.

""They had deities called Orishas. So Obatala Yemaya Oshun these were gods of rivers and bodies of water” Best says.

African nations along the coast were home to expert divers swimmers and boatmen.

They were so skilled that Africans were sought out by enslavers during the trans-Atlantic slave trade.

A plaque at the Fairmount Water Works' exhibit called ""Pool: The Social History of Segregation” explains that the swimming skills of American Blacks far exceeded those of white Americans well into the 19th century.

A racist cliche that Black people can't swim is often traced to the Middle Passage when Igbo warriors chose death by water once the ships landed at Dunbar Creek on St. Simons Island in Glynn County Georgia in 1803.

Several dozen warriors who were masters of the sea chose to jump from the slave ships and sank to the bottom of the ocean as a protest to being enslaved.

“The water after (that) turns into this sacred space this place of pain and trauma” Best says. “We then see it turn into a place of freedom because they also had people who were escaping through the same passage the Middle Passage escaping and moving back to Africa to start lives again.""

The Africans who chose to stay in the Americas influenced American maritime trade.

Their stories are among the many that are part of Philadelphia's long deep African American history. NBC10's “Race in Philly” special airing Tuesday Aug. 23 at 7:30pm and viewable afterward on this page on NBC10.com is highlighting some of these stories. Black history in Philadelphia stretches from the founding of the country through the 21st century.

Africans Influenced American Maritime Trade

After emancipation Africans ""took jobs in maritime trade. And so in the early 1800s American shipping was booming exponentially. At that time about 100000 men were sea workers and a fifth of them about 20000 were Black men” says Best of the Independence Seaport Museum.

Black sea workers took jobs as oystermen boatmen fishers and whalers and thanks to the Delaware River Philadelphia grew rapidly throughout the 19th century.

""The role of sea work for Black people turned into this foundation for our communities” Best says. “The money that they used supported the homes and supported Black communities.""

As American maritime trade boomed so did immigration.

This kind of migration was not forced by enslavers but by nature.

Helena Olea associate director of programs in Alianza America says ""The lack of water precisely the dry season has impacted particular areas of both Central America and Mexico and it’s a cause why many migrate. In others it’s the excess of water: rainfalls hurricanes that in some cases destroy their homes.”

Saturnino ""Nate"" Garrido has called Philadelphia home for more than 30 years.

He left his home in the Dominican Republic at 25 years old seeking a better life in the United States.

After being denied a green card Garrido got on a homemade wooden boat with more than 50 migrants leaving the Dominican Republic.

He nearly drowned after his boat capsized from bad weather on that trip.

He was taken back to the Dominican Republic.

On his second trip he successfully made it to Puerto Rico before catching a plane to New York.

He lived for a few months there before relocating to Philadelphia permanently.

Throughout the years thousands of immigrants have died on the same journey Garrido took through the Mona Passage.

He saw migrants drown fighting for freedom but he said he'd risk everything again for his family.

“The water symbolizes for me life” Garrido said.

Now he says his family is now better off for his sacrifice.

He did however face discrimination because of how he got to the United States.

“They call you wet in Spanish ‘mojado’” Garrido says.

Nelly Jiménez CEO of Aclamo says ""There are a lot of traumas that a lot of people that are crossing the border go through. Even if they are successful they see other people falling staying behind and there is nothing that they can do. They want to belong they want to be respected they want to work.”

It’s a similar struggle African Americans faced.

Although they were long masters of the water they were stripped of their connection to it during the Jim Crow era.

Public pools were segregated. After integration many public pools closed and private pools or swim clubs opened with ""whites only"" as a policy.

The outcome was devastating.

“A lot of those folks were not able to access pools in their neighborhoods” Zindzi Harley curator at Philadelphia’s African American Museum says “possibly due to the fact that they were predominantly white institutions that were frequented by white community members that didn't want them in those spaces.”

She says that's why we see the disparities among Black youth when it comes to not being able to swim and having higher mortality rates when it comes to drowning.

According to the USA Swimming Foundation 64% of African American children can't swim.

Compare that with 45% of Hispanic and 40% of white children unable to swim.

Studies show the drowning rate is 5 1/2 times higher for Black children than white children ages 5 to 19.

Cullen Jones four-time Olympic medalist and the first African American to hold a world record in swimming almost drowned at Dorney Park in Lehigh County Pennsylvania.

Now he's one of the fastest swimmers alive.

Cullen Jones and Simone Manuel are breaking records and smashing stereotypes in swimming.

To this day swimming is a predominantly white sport.

But community leaders are working to change that narrative.

Barriers to Pool Access Bore Ingenuity

The Nile Swim Club in Yeadon Pennsylvania surfaced when Black people were denied access to segregated pools.

The current president of the swim club says ""Instead of some of those members fighting and protesting to join that swim club they came back to our community and said let’s open our own swim club"".

In 1959 the nation's first private swim club owned and operated by African Americans opened just outside of Philadelphia.

It helped swimming become a way of life for generations of local families.

For the families who had to rely on city pools barriers were based on their zip codes.

Today the city Department of Parks and Recreation manages 70 outdoor pools throughout Philadelphia.

It offers swim lessons at the pools that are open.

Finding an open pool has been a challenge in recent years.

The city was short 85 lifeguards and 90 pool attendants for this season.

As of Aug. 1 25 city-run pools were closed with nearly a dozen more closing soon well before the summer ends.

The last city pool closes on Sept. 7.

Kathryn Ott Lovell city parks and recreation commissioner says her department decides which pools to open and close based on geography and equity.

“We certainly certainly paid attention to race” she said. “But most importantly we paid attention to those communities where there's a high heat vulnerability and a high crime level you know where violence prevention is going to be a real opportunity through pools.”

But NBC10 showed the commissioner a map displaying where most city pools are closed: predominantly black and brown communities.

She says the reason is because North Philadelphia has a larger concentration of pools so that area would have more closures.

Still that leaves areas – like 12th and Cambria street and North 21st Street and Cecil B Moore Avenue – without pools.

Community leaders say having pools in those areas would help keep youth out of trouble.

Keeping youth away from crime and gangs was one of reasons famed Philadelphia swim coach Jim Ellis started his own swim program.

""I wanted to make a difference in the world” Ellis says. “Swimming is what I knew what I love. Swimming was good to me growing up.""

In the 1970s Ellis founded PDR Swim Team at the Sayre Recreation Center pool.

It was the first Black swim team in the country.

His coaching achieved national fame.

Black children from Philadelphia became elite swimmers.

His program was also a pipeline for city lifeguards.

Ellis says having no city-run indoor pools is part of the reason why more youth of color in the city aren’t involved in swimming.

“A pool being opened on a regular basis is where someone can say 'Hey this is part of my lifestyle’” he says “where a family can say 'Well every Friday and Saturday we're going swimming at a pool' that they know they'll enjoy being at. I think that makes a big difference.”

Ellis' program is no longer all Black.

It draws swimmers from all nationalities.

His program is now at the salvation army Kroc Center in Nicetown-Tioga.

Barriers Become Skin Deep

While we've witnessed the success of people of color when they immerse themselves in water for years and still to this day many have aversions it. That’s because of the impact moisture has on their hair.

Many women won't get into the pool and they avoid workouts.

Water can cause straightened or processed hair to curl back into its natural state which for a long period of time wasn’t considered socially acceptable.

A recent Nielsen report shows Black people spend nearly nine times more than their counterparts on hair and beauty products.

Letitia Barnes hair stylist at Rasa Hair Salon in Philadelphia's Germantown neighborhood says ""It’s just because for lack of a better word (we are) brainwashed with society and media and movies and how we are [told we’re] supposed to look.”

Rasa Hair Salon styles mostly natural hair that’s locked twisted or curly.

“It kind of sounds funny because we’ve been born with this hair but we never actually got the training like what do i do with it” stylist Alana Sewell says.

The lack of knowledge about Black hair goes back as far as the 1600s.

Slave masters viewed African hair as unruly unsightly and unmanageable.

To thrive Black women and men would straighten their hair.

This practice passed down through generations that has affected other areas of life and leisure.

“One of the main excuses for missing a session or rescheduling a session or not starting when they said they wanted to start – maybe pushing it to a different day to start is ‘Oh girl I’ve got a hair appointment I don’t want to sweat out my hair” Sheena Ohlig says.

Ohlig is an award-winning professional bodybuilder with the International Federation of Bodybuilding and Fitness.

She says historically women in her sport wore straight hair but she's been donning her natural curls as she competes in shows.

She says she's beginning to see a shift with women embracing their natural hair.

""There are a lot more competitors that are wearing their hair more naturally curly or with the faux locks or with the twists” Ohlig says. “I think on a more professional level the H.R. level the executive level there has to be change there.”

Embracing natural beauty restores the rights of passage to the water not just submersion but using water to keep natural hair moisturized daily to avoid breakage.

Water is not just good for our hair but also our bodies.

In 2017 and 2018 Philadelphia's Department of Public Health did a study in conjunction with the city Department of Parks and Recreation to see what would happen if they switched out old water fountains and replaced them with new hydration stations that keep the water chilled.

""We found that water consumption doubled just with the introduction of this newer higher quality water fountain"" according to Mica Root.

Root works with the city’s Division of Chronic Disease and Injury Prevention.

""One of the places where we as the health department have done a lot of work is in conjunction with the school district in schools because studies have shown that even mild dehydration affects children’s ability to learn” Root says.

From our humanity to our health water is the one thing that touches all of us.

“There is a strong bond between watermen regardless of race” William Wallace descendant of African American skipjack captains from Deal Island Maryland is quoted as saying in the book “African Founders: How Enslaved People Expanded American Ideals” by David Hackett Fischer. “Water bonds them together.”

The World Meteorological Organization presents the report The State of the Climate in Latin America and the Caribbean

The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) report entitled The State of the Climate in Latin America and the Caribbean 2021 highlights its profound repercussions on ecosystems food and water security people's health and the fight against poverty. The report was presented on July 22 2022 within the framework of a regional technical conference for South American countries organized by the WMO in Cartagena (Colombia).

“The report shows that unfortunately hydrometeorological hazards - such as droughts heat waves cold waves tropical cyclones and floods - have caused the loss of hundreds of lives caused serious damage to agricultural production and infrastructure and have caused population displacement. ” said WMO Secretary-General Professor Petteri Taalas.

“Sea level rise and continued warming of the oceans are projected to continue to affect livelihoods tourism health food energy and water security in coastal areas particularly in coastal areas of small islands and the countries of Central America. For many Andean cities the melting of glaciers represents the loss of an important source of freshwater currently used for domestic use irrigation and hydroelectric power generation. In South America the continued degradation of the Amazon rainforest remains a major concern for both the region and the global climate given the role that this type of forest plays in the carbon cycle"" explained Professor Taalas.

But Congressman Brian Higgins says the state is only expected to get a little more than $600 million right now. New York has approximately 360000 lead service lines which would cost an estimated $883.7 million to be addressed.

He says that's because the most recent survey for these needs was done in 2015 and is no longer accurate.

""One of the goals of the Infrastructure Law was to remove and replace every lead service line in America ensuring every child family and household has access to clean drinking water"" said Congressman Higgins. ""There is funding is in this law to finally make that happen we just have to work to ensure it reaches the communities that need it most.""

Higgins along with other members of Congress are asking for a new survey to update how money is split up among states.

In the letter from Higgins and his colleagues they note “According to two surveys sponsored by the American Water Works Association the seven states with the greatest prevalence of LSLs had 50% of the nation’s total. Yet based on the 2015 DWINSA EPA would only allot 18% of LSLR funding to those seven states bearing the majority of LSL burden.""

The funding is part of The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

* Fed expected to remain hawkish at Jackson Hole

* Treasury yields touch multi-week peaks

* U.S. core capital goods orders rise but momentum slows

By Herbert Lash and Alun John

NEW YORK/HONG KONG Aug 24 (Reuters) - The dollar rose and Treasury yields jumped on Wednesday ahead of a speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in two days that may affirm the U.S. central bank's aggressive policy to tame inflation or signal a ""pivot"" to subdued interest rate hikes.

U.S. and European shares gained in choppy trade as investors tried to divine whether the U.S. central bank was more likely to slow its rate hikes or stay aggressive until it brings inflation down to its target of 2%.

Yields on both German and U.S. benchmark 10-year notes rose to eight-week highs. British short-dated government bond yields hit 14-year highs. Soaring energy prices in Europe raised fears of more inflation in Germany and the UK.

The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries rose further above 3% signaling to some that the bounce-back in stocks will be short-lived. The German 10-year bund hit 1.388% and two-year UK gilts hit 2.955%.

""When the 10-year climbs above 3% all of a sudden stocks have a harder time. We saw that in May we saw that in June we're seeing it again now"" said Anthony Saglimbene chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy Michigan.

""That will be a headwind as long as the 10-year remains above 3%"" he said.

Bets that the Fed will raise rates by 50 basis points at its policy meeting in September have whipsawed to 75 basis points.

Traders of fed funds futures last priced in a 60.5% chance that the Fed will raise rates by 75 basis points next month and a 39.5% probability of a 50 basis points increase.

""The market is gyrating between this ultra ultra hawkish view and this ultra ultra dovish view"" of Jackson Hole Saglimbene said. ""It's going to be somewhere in the middle.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.08% the S&P 500 gained 0.19% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.42%.

In Europe the pan-regional STOXX 600 index closed up 0.16% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe was essentially flat up 0.02%.

The euro fell to a two-decade low and was last down 0.02% at $0.9965. The dollar index rose 0.074%.

Portfolio managers were awaiting Powell's commentary and everything else is merely speculation said Michael James managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.

""The market is trading around on not much other than sentiment and the fact that we got pretty overbought and kind of due for a pullback"" he said. ""Now we're bouncing a little bit positioning into the Fed chair's commentary at Jackson Hole.""

Economic data showed new orders for U.S.-made capital goods increased in July but the pace slowed from the prior month suggesting business spending on equipment could struggle to rebound after contracting in the second quarter.

Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft a closely watched proxy for business spending plans rose 0.4% last month the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. These so-called core capital goods orders surged 0.9% in June.

Oil prices rose in volatile trading on concerns that the United States will not consider additional concessions to Iran in its response to a draft agreement that would restore Tehran's nuclear deal and potentially the OPEC member's crude exports.

Benchmark Brent crude retreated after rising above $100 a barrel. Saudi Arabia has suggested that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries may consider cutting output though bearish economic signals from central bankers are weighing.

U.S. crude futures settled up $1.15 at $94.89 a barrel and Brent rose $1.00 to $101.22.

U.S. gold futures settled unchanged at $1761.50 an ounce.

The biotech has confirmed it will not launch the biosimilar until March 2025 however honouring the terms of its 2020 agreement with Alexion that resolved litigation over the validity of patents covering Soliris (eculizumab) in the US.

The phase 3 trial was carried out in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) one if the indications on Soliris' label and showed that there was no difference between the biosimilar – called ABP 959 – and Soliris on key measures of disease activity.

Specifically ABP 959 was as effective as Soliris at controlling intravascular haemolysis one of the hallmarks of PNH based on its effects on lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. The safety and immunogenicity profile of the biosimilar was also comparable to Alexion's drug said Amgen.

The results with ABP 959 ""demonstrate similar efficacy safety and immunogenicity as the reference product further highlighting Amgen's commitment to providing patients with access to high-quality biologic therapies"" said David Reese Amgen's R&D head.

""We look forward to working with regulators to make this potential biosimilar option available to patients.""

Complement C5 inhibitor Soliris is the flagship product in AZ's $39 billion acquisition of Alexion which closed last year making $2 billion in sales in the first half of this year although it is in the final years of its patent-protected life.

Alexion already has a newer product to defend the franchise in Ultomiris (ravulizumab) a longer-acting C5 inhibitor that requires dosing every eight weeks while Soliris is given every two weeks.

That convenience is helping to drive a rapid uptake with sales rising 28% to $853 million in the first half in part from switching of patients to the newer drug from Soliris.

AZ anticipating more to come as Ultomiris is approved for additional indications on Soliris' label like generalised myasthenia gravis (gMG) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD).

I’ve been struggling particularly to pull together this edition of Galaxy Brain because I can’t seem to stop procrastinating by playing guitar. Like every fifth white dude in their mid-30s I picked up the hobby again during the pandemic and enjoyed relearning some basics but I’d still describe my approach to the instrument as relatively shallow. Guitar was supposed to be a fun distraction so whenever I hit a wall I’d bail and return to familiar territory: a style of noncommittal half-songs and scales that I have dubbed “ambient noodling.”

But in the past two months my mindset’s shifted. When I hit the wall now I try gently to climb it. This started when I found an archived Instagram Live video that my favorite guitarist did during the pandemic: an introductory music lesson that includes an exercise he uses to warm up his hands to play. It consists of every combination of the ways you can move your four fingers on a guitar string 36 sequences in all. I printed out a little chart of the combinations and started trying the exercise out.

A screenshot of the chart

To be honest it’s dull rote practice work. The sound it makes isn’t particularly soothing or cool and it’s not exactly easy at my level. When I first started doing it my fingers moved in a stilted confused manner. The exercise also hurt my brain at first; continually flubbing the sequence or having my hands and brain out of sync made my synapses feel all tangled. I finished the exercise and every part of me felt spent. Sometimes I felt worse at the instrument than when I’d started.

What follows is predictable: I’ve stuck with the exercise and gotten better. Every time I’ve done it my fingers and brain have moved with a touch more fluidity. Mentally it is still exhausting but there is something satisfying about the energy expense. The only way I can describe it is by likening it to shoveling a path out of deep snow watching the path as it is chiseled out of the landscape with each heave.

I’ve adopted this kind of rote practice with other aspects of guitar play as well and while I’m still not very good I find I’m having microscopic breakthroughs every day. A little piece of theory will click in or a riff I’m trying to pin down will for the first time lock into place as my fingers unexpectedly sync with my brain. Even if the task itself is mundane the feeling is transcendent—made all the more so by every previous failure.

I’m deeply fascinated by the art of this kind of slow progress especially when it involves physical activities that engage both mind and body. In addition to guitar I’ve become equally obsessive about learning how to hit a golf ball straight and long for the same reason: It’s this incredibly complex physical process where minuscule adjustments and repetition give way to small-seeming but big-feeling improvements. I’m fully addicted. Last week for the first time I dreamed about the guitar fretboard and notes moving across it. It was weird and cool.

I’m not suggesting that I’ve stumbled onto anything new here. Learning to play guitar is fun! is not exactly a scorching hot take. Still I’ve spent a good bit of time trying to think about why this appeals so much to me especially right now. The most obvious reason is that learning an instrument is decidedly not a screen-based activity (though I am using YouTube quite a bit for my instruction). I’ve spent the bulk of my adult life reading writing and focusing my attention on overwhelming streams of constantly updating and intruding information. Big chunks of my days require some kind of mental dexterity but much less tactile engagement so it checks out that a hands-on endeavor might feel extra satisfying. But I have a hunch that there might be more to it.

I started hunting around to see if there were more scientific-sounding explanations for this particular flavor of gratification. What I stumbled on instead was an old idea but one new to me: the theory of “calm technology” a phrase coined in a 1996 essay by the computer scientists Mark Weiser and John Seely Brown. Weiser and Brown who both worked at Xerox PARC predicted that the growth of the internet and microprocessors would help usher in an era of “ubiquitous computing” sometime between 2005 and 2020. This era they suggested would be dominated by the rise of “imbedded [sic] computers” in all kinds of formerly analog devices: “in walls chairs clothing light switches cars—in everything.” The pair also anticipated that the ubiquitous-computing era would erode our sense of calm. As computers were initially intended for limited daily interaction Weiser and Brown argued that they were designed to excite by delivering information quickly perhaps even in overwhelming ways. Naturally they worried about what might happen to our senses when computers were everywhere and in everything. It’s safe to say that they were onto something.

Weiser and Brown went on to suggest that technology doesn’t have to overwhelm and that if designed correctly it can even soothe. They define calm technology as a tool that “engages both the center and the periphery of our attention and in fact moves back and forth between the two.” Why is this calming? The pair said that we do actually absorb a lot of things that happen on the periphery—“thus the periphery is informing without overburdening.” The second reason is that “by recentering something formerly in the periphery we take control of it.” From the piece:

Peripherally we may become aware that something is not quite right as when awkward sentences leave a reader tired and discomforted without knowing why. By moving sentence construction from periphery to center we are empowered to act either by finding better literature or accepting the source of the unease and continuing. Without centering the periphery might be a source of frantic following of fashion; with centering the periphery is a fundamental enabler of calm through increased awareness and power.

Reading this reminded me of my colleague Ian Bogost’s recent ode to the stick shift and reflections on the end of manual transmission in cars. Bogost writes “The manual transmission’s chief appeal derives from the feeling it imparts to the driver: a sense whether real or imagined that he or she is in control.” The stick shift is a great example of calm technology that blends physical and tactile skills with mental focus asking the operator to move information from the periphery to the forefront of their attention. When driving a stick shift you’re primarily paying attention to traffic patterns and the road but you’re also keeping portions of your peripheral attention focused on going in and out of gears. Once you learn the basics the sensation of operating the manual transmission is empowering not overwhelming.

I am not sure whether Weiser and Brown would consider the guitar to be a piece of calm technology but their definition resonates with my experience especially when I’m playing along with a backing track to a song on YouTube. Playing with other musicians or along with a recorded song means absorbing and processing a great deal of information in real time. But so much of that information is kept on the periphery of my attention as I switch my focus between my movements and the world around me. Balancing those needs creates a real feeling of autonomy. One might even call it a sense of calm.

It seems almost too obvious to point out that most of our technologies are designed to obliterate any surrounding context and to make the object itself the absolute center of one’s attention. Weiser and Brown suggested that the best way to combat this experience of information overload would be to design tools that hold excess information on the periphery—that let people know the information is there but help them focus elsewhere until it’s needed. What we got instead were interruptive communication tools dominated by push notifications that rocket peripheral information into our faces constantly. The result is a feeling that we can’t parse what ought to be peripheral and what ought to be central. We feel as if we don’t have control over our attention which makes us feel unmoored and on edge.

Weiser and Brown suggest that calming technologies on the other hand make you feel “at home” which is something I feel less and less as even the digital tools I enjoy seem to shift and pivot and rebrand. I think this is why people love old websites and forums that still look and feel like they did 15 years ago and why some people feel a sense of loss when a platform or tool is redesigned. I think this is also why analog or tactile tools more easily fall into the calm-technology bucket.

I worry that once again I sound a million years old or like I’m advocating for a return to a wholly analog world. I’m not! I am still a total sucker for the conveniences of a ubiquitous-computing world and I love my information on demand and watching new cultures and subcultures explode out of new apps and tools. But I’m also deeply resentful of the ways that an attention economy has put pressure on everyone to build and design for interruptive experiences over calming ones. I’ve long told people that I am exhausted by the internet (shorthand for what is basically our information ecosystem) but I think what I’m really exhausted by is feeling like I don’t have control over what I’m attending to.

What I love about some of my hobbies is that they offer a space that respects my attention and my ability to apply and direct it where I see fit. The satisfaction of slow improvement certainly isn’t relegated to musical pursuits—it happens everywhere in my life. The difference is that the calm technologies offer me the space to focus my attention and perceive that shift happening. This experience is a joy and an increasingly rare gift.

Shameless media plugs: I was absolutely thrilled to go on The Ezra Klein Show last week to talk about future-of-work stuff and all the botched back-to-the-office plans. It’s one of the deepest conversations I’ve had about the subject. Listen and read the transcript here.

I was also really pleased with how this podcast with The Bulwark’s Charlie Sykes turned out. It builds on my interview with Josh Owens about Alex Jones and branches out from there.

Nowhere is this transformation more critical than in national defense.

Under the Joint All-Domain Command and Control project the Pentagon is working to connect sensors from all of the military services — Air Force Army Marine Corps Navy and Space Force — into a single network. JADC2 will replace the separate incompatible tactical networks that each of these entities normally maintain according to the Congressional Research Service.

The Department of Defense anticipates that such a tactical network will be needed to connect military ground personnel ships aircraft and satellites into a single cyber-secure fighting unit. The JADC2 network would enable data sharing between hundreds or thousands of sensors simultaneously even in a chaotic battle environment. Automated redundancy will be built in: If one sensor temporarily loses sight of the target other sensors will be able to cover it. The ambition and complexity of this project has led some analysts to express doubt that the necessary technology is available and can be made to work in these conditions.

“They raise questions about its technical maturity and affordability and whether it is even possible to field a network that can securely and reliably connect sensors to shooters and support command and control in a lethal electronic warfare-rich environment” notes the same CRS report.

While these concerns may be valid a solution is already on the horizon: multi-physics engineering simulation built on proven physics-based simulation software.

Engineering simulation is a mature technology that continues to develop constantly increasing in scope speed and capability. Simulation accurately applies the laws of physics to predict how a system will work — without building expensive physical prototypes. And it is already widely used across the DoD to design and test products such as weapons systems. Simulation speeds the delivery of innovative weapons systems at lower cost and improves their availability and reliability which are essential to mission success.

In the case of JADC2 we are trying to understand the positions and behavior of all the personnel and equipment on a battlefield both friendly and adversarial. To do this data from a range of sensors will need to be collected communicated combined and presented in a manner that enables battlefield decision makers to rapidly understand it make a decision and take action. Data from radar lidar optical infrared and radio-frequency sensors will have to be communicated through antennas to processors that use recognition software based on artificial intelligence and machine learning to understand the battlespace.

Fortunately the automobile sector has been working on a these very same sensor and antenna technologies in the last decade to solve the challenges of autonomous driving. While perhaps differing in scale the process of autonomous vehicles sensing their surroundings communicating with satellites and other nearby vehicles while taking action (braking accelerating changing lanes etc.) based on combined sensor data is comparable to the complex battle scenario we outlined earlier.

The radar lidar optical infrared and radio-frequency sensors along with the antennas used in both autonomous vehicles and battlespace sensors are being developed and tested using engineering simulation as a primary tool for verification and validation. Automobile and communications companies have made great progress toward the deployment of fully autonomous vehicles and in a sense have been doing much of the legwork that the military will need to make JADC2 possible.

Undoubtedly the consequences of success or failure are greater in war than on the highway. And while autonomous automobiles can operate for the most part by selfishly attending to their own priorities battlefield commanders must have a comprehensive plan that considers all the fielded personnel and equipment along with the goals of the engagement. That’s where digital mission engineering is effective.

Digital mission engineering is a digital plan that combines models of individual components (satellites ships aircraft tanks etc.) into a “system of systems” — a connected digital thread containing all components and interactions involved. Commanders can plan how the whole mission should unfold and then check on actual operations in real time giving them 360-degree situational awareness and coordination for better quicker decision making. The ultimate mission is our national defense strategy.

Digital mission engineering has been important to the growth of the space industry and the accuracy of simulation today has made possible a range of missions that were previously in the realm of science fiction. Just as the JADC2 project will require complex and interdependent analyses the space industry has been leveraging commercial software for digital mission engineering to design and operate ever more complicated missions such as visiting a small asteroid.

After years of identifying and establishing best practices the automotive industry standardized on physics-based simulation for sensor fusion and the rapid training of AI/ML applications for situational awareness and decision making. Likewise the satellite and aerospace communities have been using mission-based engineering for mission planning and test range management.

Development validation and adoption of these capabilities across such high reliability applications should provide the DoD with the assurance they are looking for when questions of maturity and affordability arise. By combining these two well-established simulation capabilities JADC2 milestones can be met more quickly and drive advanced features to the warfighter.

One you may not know about is Ansys a US public company that makes engineering simulation software and has been around since 1970. Dr. Prith Banerjee is its Chief Technology Officer and I spoke to him last week about his vision for the metaverse — and specifically why he thinks the metaverse can’t reach its full potential without “optimum physics-based modeling and simulation.”

Ansys it turns out already has a number of partnerships with companies building the metaverse — including global telecoms companies microchip and GPU manufacturers data center and storage companies and “all the cloud providers” according to Banerjee. He said that Ansys provides a mix of hardware and software expertise to these customers; everything from building hardware to designing a structural electromagnetics system.

Banerjee himself has had a distinguished career as a specialist in electronic design automation including founding a couple of companies in the 2000s and leading HP Labs from 2007-12. Originally he was a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois during the 1980s and 90s (indeed he was there when the Mosaic web browser was released in 1993).

Banerjee harkened back to those early days of the web in describing how he views the metaverse. The largely text-based internet of the Mosaic era was the first generation he said. The second generation is based on 2D images and 2D video which he said “is the world we live in now.” He thinks the metaverse will be the third generation of the internet since it will enable you to “interact with things in 3D.”

Physics Needed for Consumer Metaverse too

Surprisingly he is adamant that we will need what he terms “optimum physics-based modeling and simulation” not just for the enterprise metaverse but for the type of consumer internet that Mark Zuckerberg and others are espousing.

I can understand why physics modeling is important in creating digital twins one of the key concepts of the enterprise metaverse according to Microsoft Nvidia and others. It’s critical that a 3D “digital twin” object such as a digital car or a twin of a piece of medical equipment mimics its real-world counterpart precisely. But what does it matter if say a 3D equivalent of Facebook doesn’t have precise physics? Indeed the 3D avatars from Horizon Worlds a VR social app by Meta are currently far from realistic — they’ve been mocked for being cartoonish and anatomically deficient.

“I would say that the physics-based simulation is more important for enterprise customers today which is most of our customers […] but consumers will need this in the future” said Banerjee. He pointed out that movie animation has become very realistic down to the strands of hair on an animated character. Physics-based computer simulation will eventually bring that same level of detail to the metaverse although Banerjee gives it a timeframe of about 50 years.

Web Technology Will Drive Frontend

Given Banerjee’s framing of the metaverse as the third generation of the internet I asked him what role web technologies will play in the metaverse. After all the web was what brought the first generation into existence and (along with the mobile internet) it played a major role in the second.

“We will rely on web display technologies like React and so on but we will feed the 3D data for the simulations into that” he replied. He referenced specifically the open web technologies managed by The Khronos Group (a non-profit industry consortium in which Ansys is a member). That means open standards like WebGL OpenXR glTF and more.

So essentially he’s saying that the frontend of the metaverse will be web-based. I noted that currently native game engines like Unity and Unreal Engines are preferred for high-end graphics. So will the web be able to compete with that?

“The frontend will be the web tools — all the things like React Angular and so on — but these frontends will work with a backend” said Banerjee. “And our tools will run on the backend on the cloud. It’s not like this fast simulation will run using the web on your phone right? The compute capabilities on your phone are not good enough. So essentially […] we’ll have a frontend connection to the backend the compute will happen in the backend on the cloud — on Azure or whatever — and it will be visualized on the frontend with the web.”

Solving Connectivity

Another key part of the technical infrastructure of the metaverse will be connectivity — specifically the ability of mobile networks to consume high-fidelity graphics content. Ansys thinks the metaverse will “require unprecedented levels of connectivity in a 5G and eventually 6G world.” I asked Banerjee how difficult it will be to reach that level of connectivity given that we are barely in the 4G era currently.

He replied that it is a significant hurdle since “in simulation we are solving matrix problems” — which involves millions or billions of data points. To solve this complexity AI and ML techniques like “reduced order models” can be used to reduce the data processed from say 1 billion points to 1 thousand points.

There are also encoding techniques to help. Banerjee asked me to imagine you have a 3D frame with 1 billion points. “Now in the next frame are all the things changing? No it’s only that left part of that scene” he said. “So using very smart encoding you can actually mimic as if you’re showing all billion points but you’re only sending the deltas which is 1000.”

All 5 Senses in the Metaverse

Towards the end of the interview Banerjee told me he thinks the metaverse will — in 30-40 years’ time — be able to simulate all five human senses. This is something that some of us have written science fiction books about but Banerjee is a distinguished computer science professor and the CTO of a large engineering company. He thinks both smell and taste will be a part of the metaverse joining the touch sight and hearing that we have today in VR.

“I was at the University of Illinois [and] we had this virtual reality lab” Banerjee said. “We were actually testing all of these senses. Now they have not come to market but in 50 years they will.”

Eventually Ansys wants to open up its simulation technology for everyday people to use. Currently Banerjee said only a select few highly skilled engineers can use the type of advanced simulation tools that Ansys makes — such as Ansys Fluent its fluid simulation software that has “advanced physics modeling capabilities.” The ultimate goal he continued is “democratizing simulation.”

According to Banerjee “all 9 billion people on the planet will use simulation to do whatever things that they want. So that’s like a grand plan which is beyond the metaverse.”

The pipeline of run-off transactions remains “incredibly strong” as carriers increasingly recognise legacy deals as an “effective capital management tool” according to Aon Reinsurance Solutions’ head of capital advisory Kelly Superczynski.

Speaking to The Insurer TV Superczynski said there was “a lot of appetite” from both buyers and sellers in the legacy space with simultaneous growth in supply and demand for reserve transactions.

She explained that this was driven by the recognition that legacy is an effective capital management tool with the “stigma” that has previously been associated with the sector having now been removed.

“There’s no longer the stigma – if I do an adverse development cover it doesn’t imply that my reserves are inadequate” Superczynski explained.

Superczynski said that carriers now explore legacy transactions as they recognise that reserves associated with certain portfolios can act as a drag on capital requirements.

“Companies are required to hold a ton of capital for a book of business that’s in run-off” she explained.

“And so to be able to free up that capital in order to be able to give those liabilities to somebody who’s willing to buy them it’s really impactful on a company’s capital adequacy position and enables the company to hopefully be able to take that capital that’s freed up and be able to invest in ongoing opportunities” Superczynski said.

She also highlighted the growth in the number of legacy counterparties that carriers can transact with fuelled by fresh capital entering the sector.

As this publication has tracked there has been a wave of investment from private equity houses in recent years as run-off specialists look to scale up in response to the increase in appetite for legacy solutions among P&C players.

“There’s so much capital coming into the space” Superczynski said.

She referenced a recent Aon study which found capital supporting dedicated legacy specialist businesses has exceeded $21bn in 2022 up from ~$6bn in 2016.

“So you can just see the amount of capital coming into the legacy space.”

In addition to the surge in number – and size – of run-off counterparties able to structure legacy deals Superczynski noted that the portfolios coming to market are also evolving.

“We’re starting to see companies and investors really diversify and look at different portfolios that haven’t been historically done.”

In this 10-minute interview Superczynski discusses the following topics:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy53aW5keWNpdHlncmlkaXJvbi5jb20vMjAyMi84LzI0LzIzMzE5MzE5L2NoaWNhZ28tYmVhcnMtYXJlLXdvcnRoLTUtOC1iaWxsaW9uLW1jY2Fza2V5LWFybGluZ3Rvbi1oZWlnaHRzLWZyYW5jaGlzZS1uZmwtZGFsbGFzLWNvd2JveXMtZm9yYmVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Chicago Bears are worth $5.8 billion,"According to a recent article by Forbes the Chicago Bears are worth $5.8 billion which makes the franchise the fifth most valuable in the NFL. Numbers one through four are the Dallas Cowboys ($8 B) New England Patriots ($6.4 B) Los Angeles Rams ($6.2 B) and the New York Giants ($6 B).

Chicago’s one-year increase in value of 42% is the fourth most in the league behind the Buffalo Bills (50%) Las Vegas Raiders (49%) and the Cleveland Browns (48%).

The Bears have shown tremendous growth at a time when they haven't had much success nor do they have the luxury of being in a state-of-the-art stadium.

However the franchise has a very positive outlook for its future bottom line.

“The Bears are the lone NFL team in the country’s third-largest market a big attraction for a wealthy buyer looking to break into the league” writes Forbes. “In addition the Bears are moving toward getting either a new stadium in suburban Arlington Heights or a renovation of Soldier Field. Both scenarios would add a lot of money to the team’s coffers.”

A move to the suburbs seems the most likely outcome for the Bears and the village of Arlington Heights appears to favor the move. In a recent poll 72% of their residents are ready for the Navy and Orange to come to town although 68% of those polled do not want their tax dollars going towards the project.

The initial proposal was that India acquire 30 drones with reconnaissance surveillance and hunting capabilities; the Army Navy and Air Force would get 10 each for force application. Originally the lead player in the acquisitions was the Navy which already operates two surveillance versions of Predator drones from its base in Tamil Nadu for maritime domain awareness from the Gulf of Aden to the Sunda Straits beyond Malacca.

This week a report by news agency PTI quoted Dr Vivek Lall CEO of General Atomics as saying India is in 'advanced stage of negotiations' with the US for acquisition of 30 MQ 9B drones to crank up surveillance capabilities.

While the acquisition of the Predators - if it takes places - from the US through foreign military sales route will be a political decision the era of armed drones has now dawned in the Indian sub-continent with countries like China Pakistan Iran the United Arab Emirates Saudi Arabia and Turkey equipped with these standalone weapon systems.

A proven and capable system the Predator is prohibitively costly - the entire project will cost India upwards of $3 billion if approved.

It may be pointed out India is looking for an armed drone but would not like to spend huge amounts for purely a surveillance drone - a job done satisfactorily by the Israeli Heron upgraded drone for the Indian military at much cheaper costs.

Although the Modi government stands committed to developing armed drones through the indigenous route the matter has acquired urgency with China developing armed drones with both turbo-prop and turbo-fan engines at a rapid pace. It has also supplied Pakistan with the armed turbo-prop version of Wing Loong II drones while Islamabad is also looking towards Turkey for acquisition of much cheaper but effective Bayraktar TB 2 drone.

It is a matter of concern to India that Turkey which still thrives on its Ottoman legacy of the past is involved in upgrading Pakistani weapon systems including submarines.

India in the meantime has upgraded its Israeli Heron drones with better data link and force capability. It may not have a Predator in its arsenal but has the capability to take an unmanned aerial vehicle to fight the enemy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzLXJlcG9ydGVyLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvZnJvbS1jcnlwdG8tdG8tYWktZGVjb2RpbmctdGhlLXRlY2gtbWEtc3BhY2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,From crypto to AI: Decoding the tech M&A space,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error:  for url: https://www.business-reporter.co.uk/news/from-crypto-to-ai-decoding-the-tech-ma-space on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzLXJlcG9ydGVyLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvZnJvbS1jcnlwdG8tdG8tYWktZGVjb2RpbmctdGhlLXRlY2gtbWEtc3BhY2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

HOUSTON — APA Corp. has made its first oil discovery in Block 53 offshore Suriname.

The Noble Gerry de Souza drilled the Baja-1 well in 1140 m (3740 ft) of water and to a subsurface depth of 5290 m (17356 ft) with the well intersecting 34 m (112 ft) of net oil pay in a single interval in the Campanian.

Initial fluid and log analysis shows a light oil with a gas-oil ratio (GOR) of 1600 cf/bbl to 2200 cf/bbl in a good-quality reservoir. The discovery is a downdip lobe of the same depositional system as the Krabdagu discovery drilled 11.5 km to the west in offshore Block 58.

Evaluation continues of openhole well logs cores and reservoir fluids.

CEO and president John J. Christmann said “This result confirms our geologic model for the Campanian in the area and helps to de-risk other prospects in the southern portion of both blocks 53 and 58.”

Recently APA gained regulatory approval for an amendment to the Block 53 production sharing contract with options to extend the exploration period by up to four years.

APA has a 45% operated interest in Block 53 with Petronas holding 30% and CEPSA 25%.

The Noble Gerry de Souza drillship will shortly mobilize to Block 58 to drill the Awari exploration prospect for APA and operator TotalEnergies 27 km north of their Maka Central discovery.

In the same block the Dikkop exploration well has been plugged and abandoned after encountering water-bearing sandstones in the targeted interval.

The Maersk Valiant drillship will relocate to drill a second appraisal well at Sapakara South where the partners conducted a successful flow test late last year.

Apple Inc. plans to begin manufacturing the iPhone 14 in India about two months after the product’s initial release out of China narrowing the gap between the two countries but not closing it completely as some had anticipated.

The company has been working with suppliers to ramp up manufacturing in India and shorten the lag in production of the new iPhone from the typical six to nine months for previous launches according to people familiar with the matter. Apple which long made most of its iPhones in China is seeking alternatives as Xi Jinping’s administration clashes with the US government and imposes lockdowns across the country that have disrupted economic activity.

Analysts such as Ming-Chi Kuo of TF International Securities Group have said they anticipate Apple will ship the next iPhone from both countries at roughly the same time which would have been a significant benchmark in Apple’s efforts to diversify its supply chain and build redundancy.

Foxconn Technology Group the primary manufacturer of iPhones studied the process of shipping components from China and assembling the iPhone 14 device at its plant outside the southern Indian city of Chennai said the people who asked not to be identified because the efforts are confidential. That included looking at ways to maintain Apple’s high standards for confidentiality.

Apple and Foxconn ultimately determined a simultaneous start in India and China isn’t realistic this year although it remains a long-term goal said the people. The first iPhone 14s from India are likely to be finished in late October or November following the initial September release they said. An ambitious target would be the Diwali festival that begins Oct. 24 one person said.

A spokesman for Cupertino California-based Apple declined to comment. Foxconn did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Redington India Ltd. which distributes Apple products in the country rose as much as 9.5% after Bloomberg’s initial report.

Matching China’s pace of iPhone production would have marked a major milestone for India which has been touting its attractiveness as an alternative at a time when rolling Covid lockdowns and US sanctions jeopardize China’s position as factory to the world. Assembling iPhones often entails coordination between hundreds of suppliers and meeting Apple’s infamously tight deadlines and quality controls.

Some people within Apple and Foxconn had hoped to begin simultaneous production in India this year but that was never an official plan. To ensure a smooth launch Apple wanted to focus on getting the China operations up to speed first and then work out the India production one of the people said.

Apple’s partners began making iPhones in India in 2017 the start of a yearslong effort to build manufacturing capabilities in the country. Besides offering backup to its existing operations the country of 1.4 billion people is a promising consumer market and the Modi administration has offered financial incentives for tech production under its Make in India program.

One challenge in narrowing the cap on India production is secrecy. Apple goes to extreme lengths to keep new product details confidential and imposing the same rigorous controls in a second country would prove difficult.

Local executives in India examined entirely cornering off a section of one of Foxconn’s multiple assembly lines sequestering workers and scrutinizing all possible ways in which the security around the device could be compromised according to two of the people. Thus far the drastic security controls and stringent seclusion of its China facilities would be challenging to replicate one of the people said.

Apple has also been concerned about Indian customs officials who typically open up packages to check whether imported materials match their declarations another potential vulnerability for product secrecy.

Even if Apple and Foxconn intended a simultaneous launch supply-chain challenges would have stymied the goal. China the source of many iPhone components has gone through successive waves of lockdowns complicating the process of shipping components through the country.

India’s workforce and factories haven’t easily adopted the highly controlled practices that Apple requires from suppliers. Since Apple began assembling iPhones in India through contract manufacturers Foxconn and Wistron Corp. five years ago workers have revolted over salaries and the quality of food in two prominent incidents.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluYy5jb20vamFzb24tYXRlbi83LXllYXJzLWFnby1hcHBsZS1tYWRlLWEtYmlnLWJldC10aGF0LWlzLXF1aWV0bHktZG9taW5hdGluZy10aGlzLTItdHJpbGxpb24taW5kdXN0cnkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,8 Years Ago Apple Made a Big Bet and It's Quietly Dominating this $2 Trillion Industry.

Steve Daines took a tour of the new Applied Materials facility in Kalispell on Wednesday.

The company manufactures subassemblies and process equipment used in semiconductor production for electronic devices including everyday items like televisions phones and computers.

Daines says the recently passed CHIPS and Science Act will help Montana tech businesses create jobs invest in research and development and boost national security.

The new facility will employ up to 250 people at full capacity.

Daines' office released the following:

Today Senator Daines toured Kalispell’s new Applied Materials facility where they are manufacturing subassemblies and process equipment used in semiconductor production for electronic devices. The new Applied Materials facility will employ up to 250 people at full capacity. The recently signed “CHIPS and Science Act” championed by Senator Daines will help Montana tech businesses create jobs invest in research and development and boost our national security.

“Companies like Applied Materials are driving American innovation and leading the world in cutting edge technologies that will help us win the race against China. The bipartisan ‘CHIPS and Science Act’ will help support Montana’s tech sector create good-paying STEM jobs and support research and development—it’s good for Montana good for our economy and good for our national security” Daines said.

In 1990 the U.S. accounted for 37% of global semiconductor fabrication capacity. By 2020 our share had to 12%. In contrast China had no capacity to produce semiconductors in 1990 but by 2020 it had nearly 13% of production. The Chinese share of global manufacturing is to reach 24% by 2030 which would make it the world leader.

The “CHIPS and Science Act” will:

Boost national security by ensuring the U.S. stays on the cutting edge of semiconductor research design and manufacturing





Invest in American innovation and technology to ensure the U.S. maintains its competitive edge over China





Promote high paying U.S. technology and manufacturing jobs

The bill includes Daines’ “FABS Act” “Endless Frontier Act” and “National Science Innovation and Technology Strategy Act.” It also includes funding for “CHIPS for America Act” which Senator Daines championed in the NDAA.

Semiconductors are used in many everyday items including cars televisions phones refrigerators radios and computers as well as advanced technologies important for our national security.

“I saw it as a pretty high-quality experience for a teacher like myself to go into an industry setting and see exactly what employees are doing. Now when I go back to the classroom and students ask me what it’s like to work in that field or they ask me what do I need to know to do this I can tell them” Butts said.

The externship which was offered to teachers throughout Montana was developed through a partnership between Reach Higher Montana and the Montana Manufacturing Extension Center. Both organizations are members of a state work-based learning collaborative that seeks to address Montana’s workforce needs by tapping into student potential according to a Reach Higher Montana. According to the 2021 Montana Manufacturing report more than 3900 manufacturing firms are in operation throughout the state.

Butts was able to choose from a list of manufacturers with a few participants located right in the valley. He chose Applied Materials a global semiconductor and display equipment company with locations in Kalispell and Evergreen because he thought it would apply to the engineering and drafting classes he teaches.

While he had toured Applied Materials in the past the externship brought a more in-depth experience that included hands-on opportunities. He completed a portion of Applied Materials’ training which included practicing different job tasks.

He said much of the work requires a grasp of basic math and reading skills particularly when it comes to measuring (using both U.S. and metric systems) counting and following directions accurately.

“All employees are not necessarily people with master’s or engineering degrees but you need to know basic stuff — measuring counting — and have pride in your work with attention to detail” he said.

“You might be counting out 100 tiny screws. If you put 103 screws in the bag someone is going to lose money down the road or if you short them [the customer] wouldn’t be able to finish assembling the part” he said as an example.

He said engineers who designed various parts and projects were usually available on-site to help assemblers assist with project changes and escalations.

“The one thing I really noticed is how they worked well as a team to accomplish an end goal to get their product out the door and shipped” Butts said.

In addition to teamwork and motivation other soft skills he noticed were important were communication organization and adaptability. As a result of the experience he hopes to put more emphasis on soft skills in the classroom.

“Just like regular academic skills … those are all things that make it easier to do your job be recognized and level up positions at a company like Applied” he said.

The average annual pay of manufacturing jobs was roughly $52000 according to the Montana Manufacturing report. Compared to the state average that is a percentage increase of 11%.

“The old myth that manufacturing jobs are dangerous dirty dead-end and depressing couldn’t be further from reality” Montana Manufacturing Extension Center Director Paddy Fleming said in the press release. “Manufacturing today offers career opportunities that are high-paying high potential important and interesting. We want teachers to experience the industry first-hand to help bring relevant real-world contact into classrooms throughout Montana.”

Recently a research group led by Prof. Sheng Zhigao from the High Magnetic Field Laboratory Hefei Institutes of Physical Science (HFIPS) of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) investigated an active and smart terahertz electro-optic modulator.

Their related results were published in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.

Terahertz (THz) technology has attracted considerable attention in recent years for its promising applications in the fields of imaging communication medicine and security. These applications drive the urgent needs for high-performance THz devices. Among them active and smart THz modulators were highly desired to realize smart THz beam scanning automatic THz imaging and other smart applications.

In this study the researchers proposed an active and smart THz electro-optic modulator based on VO 2 film. It stood out with many advantages.

Besides transmission and the absorption it could electrically modulate the reflection and phase of THz waves.

By utilizing an electric current induced IMT in VO 2 film the team achieved near-perfect antireflection (99.9% modulation depth) and 180° phase switching. By utilizing a feedback loop of ""THz-electro-THz"" geometry they also realized smart electro-optic THz control in the VO 2 structure.

The desired THz amplitude could be achieved accurately no matter what the initial condition was and how the external environment changed.

This proposed electro-optic THz modulation method taking advantage of strongly correlated electron material opened up avenues for the realization of THz smart devices.

While the corporate world in general was negatively impacted by the pandemic the widespread technology adoption triggered by the crisis came as a double-edged sword for semiconductor companies.

Most chipmakers witnessed a surge in orders as the digital shift gained steam — mainly to meet the remote-work/study requirements and facilitate the mass migration of workloads to cloud networks. On the other hand the companies struggle to meet the high demand due to short supply of raw materials and choked supply chains. Though recovery is picking up amid improvements in the pandemic situation the continuing chip shortage remains a concern.

The market headwinds came as a setback for Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) since the chip giant has been losing market share to its competitors lately. Also INTC was left out when tech stocks recouped a part of the losses they suffered in the market selloff casting doubts over the company’s ability to meet its ambitious five-year plan.

In a dismal show Intel posted weak revenues and profit for the June quarter that fell short of expectations. Adjusted earnings plunged 79% annually to $0.29 per share hurt by a 22% fall in revenues to $15.3 billion. The stock fell sharply soon after the announcement in late July and languished at a multi-year low since then.

The stock has lost about 35% so far this year dragging down investor sentiment amid fears that it might not regain the lost strength in the near future. Interestingly from the investment perspective the only bright spot is the cheap valuation. But investors might not find it attractive because better options are available.

Making Inroads

The growing demand for high-tech semiconductor products – supported by new technologies like AI and deep learning– is ushering the semiconductor industry into a new era where players with advanced technology will get a significant advantage. It seems Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) knows the pulse of the market better than others. The company continues to grab market share from Intel on the power of its futuristic products and innovation. As a result it has consistently generated stronger revenues and earnings with the bottom-line beating estimates almost every quarter in the recent past. In the second quarter revenues surged 70% year-over-year to $6.6 billion driving up adjusted profit to $1.05 per share which is up 67%.

The good news is that the moderation in AMD’s market capitalization — thanks to the market selloff — has created a great investment opportunity that is significant because the stock is expected to make solid gains going forward. The management believes that growth would accelerate in the coming quarters. The portfolio is balanced and revenue contributions from all operating segments – Datacenter Client Gaming and Embedded – keep growing.

In the first half the company successfully weathered the slowdown in the PC market by leveraging the strength of its smartphone and commercial notebook segments. The trend is expected to continue given the multiple design wins and high demand for AMD’s new-generation chips among OEMs. The stock looks like a safe bet and the time is ripe to invest in it.

Graphic Power

Meanwhile both Intel and AMD lag behind Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) when it comes to graphic chips. The graphic cards of Nvidia which pioneered the GPU technology are widely used in gaming PCs and cryptocurrency mining systems across the world. Though AMD has made significant progress in tapping into the GPU market it still has a long way to go before catching up with Nvidia. The latter also holds major partnerships with auto manufacturers and mobility service providers to offer advanced processors for self-driving.

The fabless chipmaker has an impressive track record of posting better-than-expected quarterly earnings over the years reflecting the stable revenue growth. It entered fiscal 2023 on a positive note reporting a 46% growth in first-quarter revenues to $8.3 billion and a 50% rise in adjusted earnings to $1.36 per share. However of late elevated operating expenses have put margins under pressure.

NVIDIA Corporation Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript

Though the stock experienced volatility after retreating from last year’s peak it mostly outperformed the market during that period.

Compared with general additive manufacturing (AM) methods Multi-material additive manufacturing (MMAM) enables a higher level of design freedom such as integrating materials structure and function to achieve tailorable functionalities (e.g. local wear resistance high thermal conductivity thermal insulation and chemical corrosion resistance etc.). However MMAM of metallic materials is a recent research activity still in its embryonic stage. Notably there has been so far no comprehensive review about metallic MMAM covering both macroscale fabrication to microscale fabrication.

A study in the International Journal of Extreme Manufacturing summarised the recent progress on laser-based multi-material additive manufacturing (MMAM) technologies including laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) laser-baseddirected energy deposition (L-DED) and laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT) for macro-and micro-scale fabrication of multiple metallic materials.

The use of LPBF method and L-DED method to produce large multi-material parts has become a reality because of various new inventions of the dissimilar powder materials deposition mechanisms. The potential applications of these technologies are to fabricate functionally integrated components widely used in aerospace marine nuclear power and medical industries.

As for micro-AM of multiple metallic objects solid LIFT and fluid LIFT are the technologies mainly employed currently because their material transfer mechanism jetting metallic droplets from one donor plate to the building substrate is very suitable for printing dissimilar materials together. There is no contact between the donor and the printed object during material depositing hence the dissimilar raw material cross-contamination problem is avoided. The potential applications of micro-scale metallic AM technologies include: 3D micro-scale metallic structures energy storage components electronic components biomolecules biochemical sensors and cells and even directly transferring functionally devices to the surface of other parts.

Laser-based MMAM technologies are still at their early stage hence many scientific and technical challenges are waiting for solutions. The research team led by Prof Lin LI from the University of Manchester reported the state of the art of this field and pointed out both the urgent challenges and relevant high-value future research topics.

The equipment of MMAM technologies may be significantly different from the standard single-material AM processes due to the dissimilar material dispensing challenge (i.e. how to deposit the right material at the desired region in the spatial space). This work summarises the material delivery method joining of dissimilar materials processing parameters and printed MMAM components' performance. The material delivery methods for each MMAM method are introduced and their merits are compared. Three typical dissimilar material joining methods are presented. The material composition of MMAM-printed functional gradient materials (FGMs) is constantly changing. Therefore the optimized laser parameters for each material composition are essential to achieving good printing quality.

The laser parameter-induced influence on the MMAM-printed microstructure may also be significantly different from the conventional AM technology such as for the phase transition the formation of intermetallic compounds and the final mechanical properties. The current commercial 3D design software phase transition prediction software and simulation & modelling software are usually designed for single-material processing and lack the thermodynamic databases required for multi-materials processing.

All above issues are the knowledge gaps that need to be filled to push the MMAM technologies from the laboratory investigation to the actual industrial application. Professor Chao WEI explained"" we need to choose the appropriate technology based on the requirement of the final component. Before that understanding the existing methods is very important for the user to choose the manufacturing method.""

As an emerging field MMAM has significant advantages in endowing different properties within one component via combining different materials which is a new degree of freedom to the AM components. Among the potential fields Professor Chao WEI said"" laser-based MMAM has great potential in the metal functional 3D structures energy storage components and print tissues and organs in the biomedical fields.""

One of the lead researchers Professor Lin LI commented"" Laser-based MMAM technologies have obvious advantages in simplifying the manufacturing process increasing design freedom and reducing the time and costs of prototype manufacturing compared with conventional manufacturing methods. Our work only opens the door to this new research paradise. We hope that more researchers can enter this field and jointly promote the development of MMAM technologies. ""

The future MMAM research is obviously multidisciplinary involving mechanical engineering manufacturing engineering materials science electronics photonics biology and other disciplines. Integrating complex hybrid manufacturing systems establishing new laws for MMAM designing and manufacturing high-throughout optimizing processing parameters artificial intelligence-based quality monitoring and controlling and assessing the long-term reliability of printed parts need to be further studied. However we believe that under the guidance of the actual industrial application demand and through the collaborative research of the academic community these problems will eventually be solved.

Under a legislative mandate to move from Chapel Hill to Raleigh later this year UNC System leaders are subleasing the top two floors of The Dillon office building in downtown’s Warehouse District from the insurance company Arch Capital which rented four floors of the building in 2018.

Arch Capital terminated its incentives deal with the N.C. Department of Commerce earlier this year citing a shift toward remote work and fewer in-person positions based in Raleigh Triangle Business Journal reported.

Arch Capital’s downsizing opened up 51000 square feet of prime office space for the UNC System’s leaders for the coming years while work begins on a permanent building housing UNC community colleges and the Department of Public Instruction next door to the Legislative Building on West Jones Street.

The sublease terms call for quarterly rent payments of $937500. That works out to around $73 per square foot per year. The document was released through a public records request this week.

The sublease will run from October through September of 2026 with options to extend the term. That could prove handy because it’s unclear exactly when the new state-owned building will open. The agreement also includes 154 parking spaces for UNC employees in the building’s garage.

The cost of the move had prompted criticism from some UNC Board of Governors members who noted that the staff had already moved from its longtime home off Raleigh Road in Chapel Hill to space in the Friday Center complex – both spaces owned by the university.

The cost per square foot is higher than the $41-per-square-foot lease rate listed for The Dillon building in Triangle Business Journal’s latest “Space” guide.

But UNC System spokesman Josh Ellis noted that the space comes fully furnished with parking included and The Dillon sublease was among several downtown office buildings where UNC officials obtained quotes.

“The average cost for finished space in a short-term lease was at minimum $97 a square foot annually which did not include parking – more expensive than the $73-per-square-foot annual cost of the System Office’s lease at The Dillon” Ellis said in an email. “Short-term leases are generally more expensive.”

The legislature budgeted $15 million for the cost of the temporary Raleigh space.",,,,,,,,,,,,

You’ll often see this in respect to gold. The U.S. dollar is on the verge of collapsing so act now and buy gold. For some reason people really like the idea of a crisis befalling their fellow man while they rise to the top. We’re not sure if becoming wealthy while watching others experience misfortune is the ultimate rush but it’s a good way to get clicks. Unfortunately the title of this article is anything but clickbait.

The Coming Food Crisis

There’s trouble brewing and it’s not just the domain of conspiracy theorists. Put together the pieces and there’s every reason to be alarmed. Sri Lanka is simply a remarkable country to visit or at least it used to be. Months ago the country defaulted on its debt amid massive protests. Inflation surpassed 50% in June while nine out of ten Sri Lankan families are skipping meals. The straw that broke the camel’s back was when the president decided last year to (checks notes again) ban fertilizer a move that decimated crop production. When the country started subsidizing fertilizer in the 1960s they saw rice production triple. Now the reverse is happening. A recent piece by Bloomberg talks about how “rice production in the last harvest season had already plunged 40% to 50%” while “seed and fertilizer scarcities could shrink crop yields by as much as 50% this year.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndpb25ld3MuY29tL3dvcmxkL2ZvdXItZ2xvYmFsLWdyYWluLWZpcm1zLXJlY29yZC1wcm9maXRzLWFtaWQtZm9vZC1jcmlzaXMtY2FsbHMtZ3Jvdy1mb3Itd2luZGZhbGwtdGF4LTUwOTU5MtIBfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndpb25ld3MuY29tL3dvcmxkL2ZvdXItZ2xvYmFsLWdyYWluLWZpcm1zLXJlY29yZC1wcm9maXRzLWFtaWQtZm9vZC1jcmlzaXMtY2FsbHMtZ3Jvdy1mb3Itd2luZGZhbGwtdGF4LTUwOTU5Mi9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Four global grain firms record profits amid food crisis calls grow for levying of windfall tax,"There are growing calls for a windfall tax to be imposed on grain trading companies who profiteered amid soaring food prices around the world following the Russian-Ukraine war.

The International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems (IPES-Food) has claimed that the world’s top four grain traders which have dominated the global grain market for decades have witnessed record or near-record profits or sales reports The Guardian.

The group is forecasting that demand outstripping supply would remain until 2024 leading to higher sales and profits in the next two years and keeping the grains beyond the reach of the poor the report added.

“The fact that global commodity giants are making record profits at a time when hunger is rising is clearly unjust and is a terrible indictment of our food systems. What’s even worse these companies could have done more to prevent the hunger crisis in the first place” Olivier De Schutter a co-chair of IPES-Food and UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights was quoted as saying.

The four trading companies that are said to have profiteered are— the Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Bunge Cargill and Louis Dreyfus.

These companies known collectively as ABCD control an estimate of 70 to 90 per cent of the global grain trade the UK-based news outlet said.

“Global grain markets are even more concentrated than energy markets and even less transparent so there is a huge risk of profiteering” De Schutte was quoted as saying.

Cargill saw a 23 per cent increase in revenues to a record $165bn (£140bn) for the year ended 31 May whereas Archer-Daniels-Midland reported the highest profits in the second quarter of the year.

Bunge’s sales surged by 17 per cent year on year in the second quarter and Louis Dreyfus recorded profits for 2021 up by more than 80 per cent on the previous year The Guardian reported.

Rising food prices are causing widespread suffering in developing countries and even in the rich world the combination of high food and fuel prices threatens hardship for millions.

Food prices have surged by about 20% this year and about 345 million people are experiencing acute food insecurity compared with 135 million before the Covid-19 pandemic.

Alex Maitland of Oxfam told the Guardian the current crisis was “the latest in a long series of failures in the global food system” which has been made even more fragile recently owing to extreme weather and the impacts of the climate crisis economic upheaval and the pandemic.

He said: “The war in Ukraine has caused massive price volatility and disruption of food supplies globally but this is just the latest blow facing a global food system that was already broken. Global food chains are dominated by a small number of multinational corporations. It’s unsurprising that these corporations can squeeze such massive profits.”

The Guardian revealed this week that the ABCD companies (Archer-Daniels-Midland Bunge Cargill and Louis Dreyfus) – which control 70-90% of the global grain trade – have been making a record bonanza as food prices have soared in the wake of the Ukraine war. It appears that some have also been increasing their profit margins further putting the squeeze on consumers.

Campaigners are concerned that seeds and agricultural chemicals are similarly controlled by a handful of companies with just three multinationals – Bayer-Monsanto Dupont-Dow and Chem-China Syngenta – controlling 60% of the trade. Among retailers there has also been consolidation with only 10 grocery businesses accounting for half of all food sales in the EU.

Consumers are not the only victims: farmers too struggle to make a living when big companies abuse their dominance. Maitland said: “The people who produce and buy food are the ones who suffer from a system that puts shareholder profits over people. Half of the world’s undernourished are smallholder farmers and their families. The poorest spend far more of their income on food than the richest.”

Vicki Hird head of sustainable farming at Sustain a coalition of civil society groups in the UK said: “Farmers have no control over setting prices and are ever poorer for it. It’s estimated that 25% of farm households [in the UK] are living under the poverty line.”

She added: “The current food crisis is not a new one just accelerated due to the Ukraine invasion and unless governments recognise this and act to tackle the real causes – the corporate profits at the expense of farmer incomes workers’ wages consumers and the environment – we will just lurch from this crisis to the next.”

She called for government action to halt the worst abuses and restore balance to the food system. “Strong supply chain regulation and curbing financial speculation on food crops is key to ensure that everyone has enough food now and in the future.”

Tim Lang emeritus professor of food policy at City University of London said both developed and developing countries were seeing the impacts of years of increasing distortion in food markets. “We are not giving enough attention to food – there’s a lot of attention on the energy markets but not so much on food” he said.

The concentration of power in the hands of a few secretive companies made for a less transparent market so it was hard to judge whether or where profiteering or dangerous speculation was happening. But this was just one aspect of a food system that was not working in the interests of consumers or farmers he said.

“We need to rethink the food system. People can’t afford a healthy diet and this is a very serious problem. A lot of people are making a huge amount of money out of food but food producers get about 8% of the £250bn a year we spend on food” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jby51ay9uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzLTYyNjM0OTgz0gEwaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvYnVzaW5lc3MtNjI2MzQ5ODMuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inflation: Who is benefiting from soaring prices?,Many of its rivals have backed away from coal but Glencore has argued it will be an important fuel in the process of the transition to greener forms of producing energy in some countries and that it will look to wind down production across the next few decades.

The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum couldn’t help but get emotional while sharing a glimpse at the back-to-school shopping she recently did for her college-bound son.



On August 15 Adrienne took to Instagram to capture how she helped her son prep for life in a dorm. The mom of three shared a photo of various shopping bags and household items loaded in the trunk of her car.



“Getting supplies for my son who is preparing for college... So sad” she wrote in the caption of the snapshot also adding a teary face emoji. She also added the hashtags “college bound” and “bittersweet.”

On August 19 Adrienne also posted a photo of her recent Target run. “More college stuff…” she wrote in the caption. “Today is Gavin's first day at school I had to leave him and it was the saddest day! Definitely one of the saddest of my life... “

She concluded the message with hashtags that read “college bound” and “parenting.”

Adrienne is only the latest Bravoleb to share an update on her kids moving out to college.

As our sibling site The Next Platform reported in 2015 Google calls its datacenter networking tech Jupiter which uses a mixture of merchant silicon and custom code to connect the kit that runs Search YouTube Gmail the G-cloud and plenty more besides.

On Tuesday the advertising giant published a paper and summary explaining the last decade or so of work on Jupiter.

The headline figures in both documents detail 5x higher speed and capacity 30 percent reduction in capex and 41 percent reduction in power consumption.

Plenty of those improvements are the result of Optical Circuit Switches (OCSes) that use mirrors mounted on Micro-ElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) to map an optical fiber input port to an output port dynamically.

And yup we're aware that MEMS-based and non-MEMS optical mirror switching has existed for computer networks for years and years. What's cool here is the density and throughput Google says it has developed and now documented for its own globe-spanning use.

Well we found it interesting anyway.

How Google's mirror-filled optical switch moves traffic ... Source: Google. Click to enlarge

In Google's switches a signal reaches a ""fiber collimator array"" that offers 136 physical I/O paths or individual fibers. An incoming signal emerges from one of those fibers then bounces off a splitter before hitting a MEMS device that has 136 micro mirrors. The MEMS device moves in two dimensions and reflects the signal to one of the 136 fibers in the outgoing collimator array.

The tech was needed because Google wanted its network to ""support heterogeneous network elements in a 'pay as you grow' model adding network elements only when needed and supporting the latest generation of technology incrementally.""

That means ""allowing the incremental addition of network capacity – even if of a different technology than previously deployed – to deliver a proportional capacity increase and native interoperability for the entire building of devices.""

Achieving that vision is not easy because Google's datacenter networks need to be deployed ""at the scale of an entire building – perhaps 40MW or more of infrastructure.""

""Further the servers and storage devices deployed into the building are always evolving for example moving from 40Gbit/sec to 100Gbit/sec to 200Gbit/sec and today 400Gbit/sec native network interconnects. Therefore the datacenter network needs to evolve dynamically to keep pace with the new elements connecting to it.""

Google also recognizes that its network is not a single entity.

""Datacenter networks are inherently multi-tenant and continuously subject to maintenance and localized failures"" Google's description from infrastructure VP Amin Vahdat explained. ""A single datacenter network hosts hundreds of individual services with varying levels of priority and sensitivity to bandwidth and latency variation.""

""For example serving web search results in real time might require real-time latency guarantees and bandwidth allocation while a multi-hour batch analytics job may have more flexible bandwidth requirements for short periods of time"" Vahdat stated. ""Given this the datacenter network should allocate bandwidth and pathing for services based on real-time communication patterns and application-aware optimization of the network.""

That kind of dynamic reconfiguration also helps resilience.

""Ideally if ten percent of network capacity needs to be temporarily taken down for an upgrade then that ten percent should not be uniformly distributed across all tenants but apportioned based on individual application requirements and priority"" Vahdat explains.

But networks are hardwired to do certain things well and even Google's software-defined networking can only do so much to reconfigure them to adapt to new requirements.

MEMS and OCS also make it possible to upgrade and reconfigure networks without having to rewire (or re-fiber) a datacenter.

Vahdat concluded that its network ""delivers 50x less downtime than the best alternatives we are aware of.""

So take that Cisco Juniper Arista and pals. And for the rest of us take comfort that this stuff usually trickles down over time – as happened with Kubernetes and cloud-inspired consumption based IaaS models. ®",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vaW5mb3RlY2hsZWFkLmNvbS9kZXZpY2VzL3JldGFpbC1idXNpbmVzcy1zdGVwcy11cC1zcGVuZGluZy1vbi1tb2JpbGUtcm9ib3RzLTc0MDk30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Retail business steps up spending on mobile robots,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='infotechlead.com', port=443): Read timed out.

A Daily Paws Investigation,"Brie Passano

When you think of popular dog names Max or Fido might quickly come to mind. But these days a different name has snagged the No. 1 spot in the United States and that name is ... Luna!

According to Bark (the makers of those lovely boxes) Luna is the country's favorite dog name by miles claiming the top spot in 35 states. In the remaining states Luna was beat out by Bella (seven states) Charlie (three) Daisy (one) Max (one) Lucy (one) Sadie (one) and Kona (one).

Bark based its rankings on 10 years of customer data so maybe Luna isn't the top name for all dogs. (Though pretty much all of us know a dog named Luna or Max right?)

So why has the name Luna claimed the top spot so soundly? We've investigated throughly to concoct several theories ...

Fondness for Luna Lovegood

Our very favorite Ravenclaw in the beloved Harry Potter series made such an impact on a generation of dog owners that she's become their most popular namesake. Luna was known for being quirky and kind in the book series two traits many dog owners might see in their four-legged friends.

Ends With A

We seem to like dog names that end in the letter A. Other top contenders for favorite dog names include Bella Nala Koda Stella Lola and Nova—and those are just the names we picked out of the top 20! They are pretty fun to say.

A Reason That's Actually Helpful

Many dog trainers suggest picking a moniker that has two syllables—these names are easy for dogs to learn and easy to spit out in a rush if you need to get your dog's attention quickly. Luna is an absolutely adorable option that fits the bill!

It's a Good (Fur) Baby Name

Luna has been an incredibly popular human baby name for years and we all know our dogs are basically our children (no matter what our desperate-for-grandkids parents say). There are a few popular baby names mirrored on Bark's list of most popular dog names including Oliver Nova Willow Layla and Leo.

It's Good Enough for a Famous Child!

John Legend and Chrissy Teigen have long been regarded as a Hollywood power couple so it's no stretch to think they might influence what we name our pets. The two have an adorable daughter named Luna and we're sure more than a few people used her name as inspiration when they were brainstorming dog names. Teigen also has a pup named Penny—another popular dog name that slides onto the list at No. 26!

But folks there are plenty of other excellent names for dogs that aren't Luna. If you're still looking for the perfect name for your pup check out our comprehensive lists of dog names covering everything from the best space names for your dog to the best Marvel-themed names."

Apple faces plenty of challenges this year including regulatory scrutiny in Washington sluggish sales in China and a competitive landscape in AI. Now its leaders also have to contend with labor unrest.

Apple store workers in Towson Maryland made history in June 2022 when they voted to form the first union at one of the tech giant’s sleek US stores. Since 2023 the worker group outside of Baltimore has been in contract negotiations with Apple management. Now workers are weighing a strike.

Saying management has yet to meet their core demands the Maryland workers are holding a strike authorization vote on Saturday one of the strongest labor actions taken against the Big Tech company yet. And it’s far from the only labor challenge Apple is battling in the US.

Employees in New Jersey are holding a union election this weekend. In addition the National Labor Relations Board this week upheld a decision alleging Apple’s union-busting tactics in New York City. The company also has unfair labor practice complaints against it in front of labor judges right now (Apple denies these allegations).

The labor wave that has hit Apple retail stores echoes the mass organizing that began at other influential companies in the United States such as Starbucks and Amazon. As Apple grew to become the world’s first $3 trillion company a tight labor market coming out of the Covid-19 pandemic exposed labor conditions and inequalities front-facing workers in places such as stores and warehouses faced.

“It speaks to a growing frustration among workers and also a contagion in labor activity which is when one group of workers stands up and inspires others” Kate Bronfenbrenner the Director of Labor Education Research at Cornell’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations said.

So far workers at two Apple store locations – Towson Maryland and Oklahoma City – have voted to unionize. But the union vote in New Jersey this weekend along with other efforts across the country could just be the beginning.

Apple is a high profile company – and many many Americans have at least one Apple product.

“This whole segment of the economy that didn’t have a lot of activity suddenly has activity. The Apple workers (possibly) going on strike is going to be a spark for other workers” Bronfenbrenner said.

“At Apple we work hard to provide an excellent experience for our retail team members and empower them to deliver exceptional service for our customers. We deeply value our team members and we’re proud to provide them with industry leading compensation and exceptional benefits. As always we will engage with the union representing our team in Towson respectfully and in good faith” an Apple spokesperson said in an emailed statement to CNN.

A possible strike

The Maryland workers are considering a strike because after over a year of negotiations management had yet to come up with solutions to core issues such as “work-life balance unpredictable scheduling practices that disrupt personal lives and wages that do not reflect the cost of living in the area” a release by the union said.

A strike sanction vote doesn’t mean the store is going on strike. It’s one step of a longer process that ends with a final strike authorization vote.

The workers at the Maryland Apple store are members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Coalition of Organized Retail Employees (IAM COTE).

“This strike sanction vote sends a strong message that the workers want Apple to recognize the need for an equitable and respectful work environment for all its employees” IAM District 4 Directing Business Representative Jay Wadleigh said in a statement.

The Maryland store has an ongoing complaint filed against Apple which alleges the company provided improved health and education benefits to non-union employees and not the unionized employees.

Bronfenbrenner said a big motivation behind organizing is the gap between corporate profits in America’s biggest companies – such as Apple Amazon and Google – and worker wages and benefits especially for workers in retail stores or warehouses.

“There’s just a lot of anger. And the corporations like Apple have made huge profits while the workers feel like their wages have stagnated” Bronfenbrenner said.

Union drives in full swing

Apple like other big companies is cracking down on union activities. The NLRB found that Apple went too far in trying to crack down on a union drive in New York City.

The NLRB ruled this month that Apple unlawfully interrogated employees and confiscated and prohibited union flyers while allowing non-union materials at the World Trade Center location in 2022.

The NLRB held up the US Labor Board judge’s decision from last year – which was the first time a labor judge ruled against Apple. The affirmation from the NLRB is a win for labor organizers.

But across the river in New Jersey there is a union election for employees in Short Hills a New York City suburb.

There are other unfair labor practice complaints against Apple before labor judges at the moment.

Similar to New York City workers in Atlanta issued a complaint in 2022 alleging Apple illegally interrogated employees about union support and tried to convince them not to join one.

The labor action is not just taking place at Apple’s front-facing retail stores. In its Cupertino California headquarters a decision is pending for a complaint that alleged Apple illegally fired disciplined threatened and interrogated an employee for “engaging in protected concerted activity.”

Big Tech traditionally seen as a prestigious and secure field has been hit with mass layoffs. These workers “tend to be higher paid positions and more technological positions. And those are workers that traditionally were not seen as organizing” Bronfenbrenner said.

In a statement regarding the open complaints Apple said “We strongly deny these claims and look forward to providing the full set of facts to the NLRB.”

Four decades after it got its start in southern Marin County now-global design software maker Autodesk has given notice that its gradual headquarters relocation to San Francisco will soon be complete.

As of Oct. 14 the company will be officially closing its former headquarters at 111 McInnis Parkway in San Rafael and reassigning the 578 Marin employees to its San Francisco base in the Landmark at One Market building according to an Aug. 15 filing with the state Employment Development Department.

“Most of these employees are now designated as hybrid employees and therefore do not have mandatory weekly in-office days” wrote Rebecca Pearce chief people officer to the agency. “Five of the employees are office-based and will therefore be required to work in the San Francisco office consistent with our internal guidelines.”

In January Autodesk it was giving up leases on two other office locations in San Rafael and San Francisco even as the company continued to hire in the Bay Area to support growth and replace turnover said to be below industry average.

At the time surges of infections from the delta and later omicron variants of the coronavirus were sweeping through the country and a number of Bay Area technology firms were slowing or reversing their return-to-office plans. Likewise Autodesk accelerated its “flexible workplace” program based on input from employee surveys.

Autodesk started April 1982 with 13 programmers working from the Mill Valley home of co-founder John Walker according to the Marin Independent Journal. Its main product was AutoCAD which became a popular driver for the transition from mainframe-based design to work done on personal computers.

The software maker now has global operations with $4.39 billion in revenue last fiscal year from multiple software lines in construction engineering manufacturing and media production.

The company on Wednesday reported second-quarter revenue of $1.24 billion up 17% from a year ago.

Soon after its founding the company expanded to a Mill Valley office complex then in 1984 grew again in a move to Sausalito. In 1994 the company moved to San Rafael into the newly built 115000-square-foot 111 McInnis building which remains under lease through 2024.

The offices Autodesk leaves behind in Marin may not stay empty for long according to Haden Ongaro who leads North Bay operations for real estate services firm Newmark.

“It’s unfortunate to see companies leave but we have a history of success backfilling the space” Ongaro said. “I’m confident someone will come in and take the Autodesk space as we’ve seen before.”

In its Marin expansions and contractions in recent years Autodesk left behind large spaces at 4000 Civic Center Drive which were filled by Sutter Health and at 4040 Civic Center now home to multiple companies.

When Lucasfilm left Marin for San Francisco its office and industrial portfolio in San Rafael was mostly occupied within 18 months. Glassdoor also exited Mill Valley for San Francisco last year and its former 42000-square foot space is now leased.

(NASDAQ: ADSK) on Wednesday said its second-quarter 2023 earnings increased aided by strong revenue growth.

Adjusted earnings of the San Rafael California-based tech firm rose to $1.65 per share in the July quarter from $1.21 per share in the corresponding period of last year. The reported net income was $186 million or $0.85 per share in the latest quarter compared to $115 million or $0.52 per share in the second quarter of 2022.

The company reported total revenues of $1.24 billion for the second quarter which is up 17% from the prior-year period. The top line also beat the market’s forecast.

The news was an all-around win sufficient enough to send the companys shares up in after-hours trading on Wednesday.

Autodesk posted adjusted earnings of $1.65 per share which handily beat analysts estimates calling for $1.57 per share. Revenue also came out ahead of projections. While the consensus called for $1.22 billion in revenue Autodesk posted $1.24 billion.

The last 12 months for Autodesk shares were on a fairly steady decline. At least until recently. This time last year Autodesk shares were up over $342 per share. The value slipped going into September but saw a rally in mid-October that saw shares ultimately hit just over $329.

The rally lost steam in mid-November and began a slump that lasted all the way to mid-June. That was when the company hit $164. Another rally followed and now the company is challenging $230 per share in Wednesdays after-hours session.

It was a win for Autodesk no matter how you slice it but can Autodesk keep its streak alive? A look at the conditions and Autodesks prospects suggests something of a dim picture. Thus I stand at neutral on Autodesk a company with a great product line geared toward a target market thats likely to come under heavy fire with an economic downturn.

Investor Sentiment is a Little Mixed for ADSK Stock

Analyst enthusiasm aside there are some clear signs of concern coming out of the investor sentiment metrics around Autodesk. Currently Autodesk has a 7 out of 10 Smart Score on TipRanks. Thats the highest level of neutral and suggests a somewhat better than even chance that the company will ultimately outperform the broader market. Despite this however insider trading is heavily sell-weighted. In the last three months insiders sold $311200 worth of Autodesk shares.

However theres one key point worth considering here. Yes insiders sold off a larger quantity than they bought in aggregate but more insiders bought in the last three months than sold. Autodesk saw 10 buy transactions but just seven sell transactions.

A look at the last 12 months suggests a larger problem in the making. Sell transactions led buy transactions by 33 to 24. While sellers are leading buyers by about three to two the latest figures are increasingly buy-weighted. In fact the buying activity started in earnest around January when the company was into its big leg down ahead of the June recovery.

A Solid Win but an Encore is Uncertain for ADSK Stock

Heres the problem in a nutshell with Autodesk. It had a great quarter. There are no two ways about that. It beat estimates on every front but the problem is can it keep going? Certainly there are those who see a path to victory here and theyve got a solid rationale. For instance one report points out that the companys share price has already been beaten down pretty heavily as a result of the general tech meltdown.

It also notes that the companys subscription-heavy business model gives it a nice source of recurring income. Plus that recurring income has already proven durable in the past. To top it off its extensive product portfolio gives it an edge in diversification.

These are all perfectly valid points but theres a problem; none of these points were really proven during an economic downturn. Subscriptions do tend to be durable. After all 78% of adults paid for a subscription service in the U.S. last year.

A subscription that has a direct impact on business operations is likely to be one of the last expenses thrown over. Thats particularly true in the case of low-cost subscriptions. If theres a $500 per month subscription and a $1 million capital budget where do the most savings lie? Canceling the subscription? Or cutting the capital budget by 10%?

Those are strictly hypothetical numbers of course but the value of a subscription backed up by sheer inertia is likely to keep a subscriber in the fold except for when money is particularly tight. Then even that modest subscription fee may not hold out.

Autodesk is working to prevent this however by changing its subscription basis. The company is introducing “Flex Tokens” which allows customers to budget their use of Autodesk services by buying a block of time on these platforms.

Further Autodesk is stepping up its connection to customers by offering training programs. Thats likely to prove a smart move; trainers tend to be respected in their fields. The old adage about those who cant do teach usually doesnt apply in a field like this and should those respected trainers promote their own products in the process its just good business.

However there are also troubles emerging. Autodesk has been cutting back on features in its products. Now Autodesk is removing local simulations regardless of what license tier is involved. There can be something to be said for simplifying a product but simplification can strike customers as a bad deal if the simplification allows less to get done.

Is Autodesk Stock a Buy or Sell?

Turning to Wall Street Autodesk has a Strong Buy consensus rating. Thats based on 13 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The average Autodesk price target of $259.07 implies 20.82% upside potential. Analyst price targets range from a low of $220 per share to a high of $290 per share.

Conclusion: Paths to Victory and Calamity for ADSK Stock

There is absolutely a case for Autodesk to succeed. The problem however is that theres almost an equal case for Autodesk to not succeed. If the subscription model has sufficient value and inertia behind it then it will likely come out the other side. That assumes that its client companies will at least pursue the status quo for a while. Autodesks training efforts should cement its brand in customers minds as a valuable source of information and insight as well as products.

Throw in the fact that Autodesk is trading just inches above its lowest price targets and theres plenty of upside to help sweeten the pot.

However there are significant problems too. If enough companies fold or cut back during the economic downturn thats going to hit Autodesk where it hurts. The reduction of features doesnt exactly help. Insider trading isnt exactly looking for a home run either though the resurgence of buying could prompt optimism.

So with almost equal cases for win and loss before us I stand neutral on Autodesk. It might deliver a big success. It might crash and burn. With no clear winner ahead Ill stay off the trail altogether.

With equity diversity and inclusion high on the agenda for corporates In-House Perspective considers how counsel can help drive effective change.

Corporations worldwide have declared equity diversity and inclusion (EDI) a strategic imperative but the adoption of a formal EDI policy outlining a company’s position on the issue is far from a simple catch-all solution.

In-house counsel can play a pivotal role in designing an effective EDI strategy which goes beyond legal compliance and adds real value to an organisation’s operations from improving employee wellbeing and engagement to boosting profit margins.

EDI policy: a North Star for business

‘For many companies there is a genuine deep conviction at different levels of the organisation that EDI leads to a stronger and more successful company with better results better communication better retention’ explains Graham Wladimiroff Chair of the IBA Corporate Counsel Forum and Vice President and Assistant General Counsel at Avery Dennison who’s based in Hong Kong.

This conviction is underpinned by countless studies over recent years that have proved the causal link between a business’ focus on EDI and financial performance. For example in Diversity wins: How inclusion matters global management consultants McKinsey & Company followed the trajectories of 1000 companies across 15 countries from 2014 to 2020.

The study found ‘ample evidence that diverse and inclusive companies are likely to make better bolder decisions’ and that a visible commitment to EDI is ‘likely to strengthen companies’ global image and license to operate’.

For Iván Suárez Co-Chair of the IBA Diversity and Equality Law Committee and a partner at Suárez de Vivero in Barcelona EDI has become an ‘unstoppable movement’. He compares making a public commitment to EDI as akin to adopting an environmental policy for private sector companies which have heard the message loud and clear that those that don’t embrace it will see the impact on their balance sheets.

‘Organisations know that what’s on your corporate agenda is very important’ says Suárez. ‘As a company you’ll find it increasingly difficult to sell your products without a visible commitment to EDI over the coming years. And internally without instilling an EDI culture you will struggle to recruit – and keep – talent. Employees are demanding employers uphold their promises to improve EDI.’

“Internally without instilling an EDI culture you will struggle to recruit – and keep – talent

Suárez warns that while an EDI policy is ‘a fantastic marketing tool it doesn’t automatically guarantee that you are practising positive EDI – nor that you have a structural framework in place to protect it. A formal policy should reinforce a company culture rather than stand as proof of it.’

Wesley Bizzell Senior Assistant General Counsel and Managing Director of Political Law and Ethics Programs at financial services company Altria Client Services agrees that having a publicised mission is not enough.

‘Organisations are mission and values-driven from a business and financial perspective’ he says. ‘A formalised EDI statement that is used both internally and externally is important as it sets the standard and goals of the organisation’s values and outlines where they want to be as an entity. Without it organisations can lose sight of what they’re trying to achieve.’

But he stresses ‘you need to have the practices and procedures in place to effectuate cultural change internally’.

Putting policy into practice

In early 2022 the IBA European Regional Forum Diversity and Inclusion Working Party carried out a survey to understand how EDI is perceived by European law firms. One result from the survey was that the majority of law firms don’t have an internal policy on EDI.

‘While it’s not a must for a workplace to have a written EDI policy it is a must for it to follow EDI principles in practice’ says Antonia Verna Vice-Chair of the Working Party and a partner at Portolano Cavallo.

‘But in our opinion having a written policy does make it easier for the institution to follow those principles for everyone to be on the same page about what those principles are and to monitor whether they are being followed’ says Margareta Sovova Chair of the Working Party and a partner at bnt attorneys in Central and Eastern Europe.

Verna and Sovova explain that of the EDI policies in place they found that the majority are very general. In the main policies outline the importance of EDI but don’t identify specific actions or provide a concrete programme for cultural change.

The next step in the project is therefore to draft an EDI toolkit (due to be published in early 2023) ‘to help firms begin thinking of how to draft and implement EDI policies. The aim is to embed the idea that a successful EDI policy involves putting concrete and effective actions into practice’ says Verna.

While this resource is targeted specifically at law firms in a region where Margareta explains ‘most countries have no regulations for legal services or businesses when it comes to EDI’ its approach may well be relevant for corporates around the world as the focus on EDI gathers momentum.

Ajay Singh Solanki is Co-Chair of the IBA Disability Rights Working Group and Leader of the Labour & Employment Law Practice at Nishith Desai Associates in India.

He argues that larger organisations will be more likely to implement such processes. In a landscape where in-house counsel are already vying for an adequate slice of the corporate budget ‘smaller organisations may invariably be more inclined not to pursue these action points as they often require additional infrastructure and financial support’.

And with some jurisdictions lacking a mandatory obligation for private sector companies to have a formal EDI policy in place in-house lawyers may also find that there are conflicting expectations and duties when it comes to furthering the EDI agenda – at least in writing.

‘In-house lawyers have a duty to advise the organisation with respect to the legal risks of including a long list of protected characteristics in their EDI policy in the first place’ Solanki says. ‘For example if the law of the country in which the corporation operates provides lesser protection to the individual than what is outlined in the company’s EDI policy what is the level of litigation exposure? In some jurisdictions having contractual protections in the EDI policy may mean having to defend additional discrimination claims in court.’

In these cases a company may need to choose its approach carefully while drafting its EDI policy.

However D’Arcy Kemnitz Co-Chair of the IBA LGBTI Law Committee and Executive Director of the US National LGBTQ+ Bar Association says that having something in writing is ‘a baseline floor’.

‘Having an EDI policy isn’t reaching for the ceiling of celebration of cultural diversity’ she says. ‘It can be minimal and dry with the aim of demonstrating an understanding of the law and the legal minimums a company is beholden to.’

Challenges for multinationals

The question of how multinational corporations in particular might enforce even a ‘baseline’ EDI policy internally remains a complicated issue – one that’s based on the specific characteristics protected under the law in local jurisdictions in which they operate.

For example more than 70 countries worldwide still criminalise consensual same-sex sexual activity – 11 of which are jurisdictions that still impose the death penalty – so while a corporate policy may make a multinational’s global stance very clear LGBTI employees may still be at risk of exposure to potentially significant problems by bringing their whole selves to work.

And if an international company policy recognises a protected characteristic under its EDI policy but the local jurisdiction doesn’t escalating an issue to the courts is fraught with challenges.

‘Employment laws are mostly specific to the location and it can be very difficult for an individual to go through the international human rights system. Even assuming the whole thing was done pro bono it’s slow traumatic and exposing’ explains Joseph J Catanzariti AM a Member of the IBA LGBTI Law Committee Advisory Board.

Notwithstanding these difficulties he argues it’s ‘still very important that international companies have EDI policies in place. Employees need to see that the corporation is trying to embrace EDI’.

Having an internal structure for addressing complaints is imperative. But Catanzariti says in this context the position of in-house lawyers can be difficult to navigate.

‘In-house counsel can end up in the middle standing both as a senior leader and as a regular employee’ he says. ‘While it’s very important that they have a clear influence in the corporate governance of the company internal investigations can cause tensions if the employees involved feel they’ve not been treated fairly.’

Outsourcing complaints to an independent body is one solution. Catanzariti is also a vice president of Australia’s independent workplace tribunal the Fair Work Commission (FWC). The FWC through Australian legislation has been given specific powers to deal with bullying and sexual harassment claims.

‘While most cases are focused on monetary compensation at the FWC we have the jurisdiction to issue a stop order where we believe there is a risk to an individual’s health safety and wellbeing as a result of bullying or sexual harassment’ he explains. ‘We also have the power to issue non-monetary orders such as monitoring a workplace for compliance.’

Catanzariti says the benefit of this model is that it’s focused on stopping the behaviour in the immediate and long-term. ‘If somebody has a judicial finding that says “This person has engaged in discrimination” it can be Googled forever. It affects your future employment prospects.’

Leveraging in-house perspective and position

Practising positive EDI in the workplace is undoubtedly a complicated issue. While EDI applies to every company worldwide the issue cannot be addressed in the same way with the same speed everywhere.

‘Companies oftentimes are looking for that silver bullet but EDI is too systemic an issue to be addressed by one particular programme’ says Wesley Bizzell. ‘Companies have to address this on multiple fronts. You can’t have a siloed approach to move the needle on EDI; you have to do multiple things all at once.’

For Bizzell in-house lawyers are therefore uniquely positioned to effectuate fairly dramatic change in an organisation’s culture from an EDI perspective because they ‘see the full enterprise’.

‘We have a special perspective to understand cultural differences that may exist in different parts of the organisation’ he adds. ‘Having someone who is passionate about EDI in the legal department who is working hand-in-hand with the broader EDI advocates is really essential.’

For Wladimiroff while every employee has a responsibility to make the EDI agenda a success he underlines the large role the Human Resources department plays in supporting the company and its management to drive the EDI agenda.

‘In-house teams can contribute through ensuring the agenda can be as effective as possible in a given local legal environment as well as support the effort in applying a degree of judgement where it comes to communication and policies in particular in regions where some aspects of the EDI agenda can be quite sensitive’ he says.

Furthering the EDI agenda

Going beyond legal compliance there are other specific actions in-house lawyers can take to further the EDI agenda in their organisations and more widely.

Solanki emphasises the importance of in-house counsel ‘seeking examples from across the globe’ and bringing these lessons into their day-to-day practice. Attendance at conferences and seminars is essential he says. ‘There are so many examples and experiences from across the world that may be picked up in these specific legal forums.’

Suárez echoes this sentiment. ‘What lawyers learn from those forums about how to communicate combined with their understanding of the local jurisdiction means in-house counsel can really help in shaping a company’s training programme for HR managers business partners etc on how to be truly inclusive.’

He also highlights in-house lawyers’ role in signing off the fine print from who best to contact in case of a problem to outlining the company’s stance on whistleblowing and confidentiality. ‘These things are so important for in-house counsel to advise on as their inclusion in formal policies bring clarity and certainty on a company’s position which strengthens trust in the organisation.’

Catanzariti meanwhile places emphasis on in-house counsel having a hand in developing training – and undergoing it themselves. ‘As much as people think repetitive training isn’t useful the aim isn’t to learn facts but to change behaviour. Interactive training modules should be repeated every 12 or 18 months with the organisation making sure they’re short friendly pitched at different levels clear and practical.’

Another tangible way in which in-house counsel can make an impact in the EDI space is to learn lessons from their organisation’s consumers; that is by using their buying power as leverage – in particular when it comes to their suppliers.

And law firms are increasingly aware of this. During Verna and Sovova’s study for the Diversity and Inclusion Working Party they learned that this is a specific motivation for law firms to implement EDI policies.

‘In speaking to law firms we learned that if corporate clients have an EDI policy in place they expect the law firm to have one as well’ explains Sovova. ‘It’s a bit of a driving force for the law firms. Even though it might not be the ideal motivation it creates the impetus for law firms to embark on this journey.’

It’s not a moment too soon. Despite anti-discrimination laws having been in existence for decades in many jurisdictions in the main corporate law firms have dragged their feet when it comes to incorporating EDI into the typical partnership structure.

Indeed a 2021 Bloomberg investigation found that major global companies such as Facebook HP and Novartis have warned ‘they’ll take their work elsewhere or cut fees unless they see more racial and gender diversity in the law firms they hire’.

Many corporates are following suit increasingly building EDI targets into their procurement practices as a standard procedure and requesting the data to prove it.

‘Requests for proposals are often accompanied by questions not only around a law firm’s EDI policies but what the data shows in terms of gender ratio percentages of protected characteristics geographical area educational background etc’ says Solanki.

He emphasises however that this is a two-way conversation. ‘Similarly corporates approach their law firms not just for legal advice but also for best practice and insight as to how other clients are implementing such policies.’

A duty to fairness and equality

For D'Arcy the duty of in-house counsel – and indeed all lawyers – goes beyond their day-to-day services to the organisation that employs them.

‘In the United States we have a public obligation to carry out neo-platonic justice that other professionals such as journalists or doctors just don’t have’ she says. ‘For example we have an obligation for continuing legal education credits and for dedicating a certain amount of hours to pro bono work.’

‘People come to us to answer really hard conversations about what is “fair” and “equal” and we’re supposed to have answers’ she explains. ‘In-house lawyers then not only have a certain privilege and standing within their organisation to influence its approach to EDI from the top down but an obligation to have answers that they can pass out and apply in a fair and equal manner to all colleagues and stakeholders who come to them for advice.’

D'Arcy gives the example of a franchise structure where the in-house counsel employed by the parent organisation are in a position to advise independent business owners on EDI issues they may be facing.

‘We’re trusted advisors and in order to maintain that privilege and trust you have to really earn it by leaning into these conversations across the board’ she adds.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nbG9iZW5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2UvMjAyMi8wOC8yNC8yNTAzNTI2LzI4MTI0L2VuL1dvcmxkd2lkZS1CYXJjb2RlLVByaW50ZXItSW5kdXN0cnktdG8tMjAzMC1TaXplLVNoYXJlLU91dGxvb2stYW5kLU9wcG9ydHVuaXR5LUFuYWx5c2lzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Worldwide Barcode Printer Industry to 2030 - Size Share Outlook and Opportunity Analysis,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMipQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nbG9iZW5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2UvMjAyMi8wOC8yNC8yNTAzNTI2LzI4MTI0L2VuL1dvcmxkd2lkZS1CYXJjb2RlLVByaW50ZXItSW5kdXN0cnktdG8tMjAzMC1TaXplLVNoYXJlLU91dGxvb2stYW5kLU9wcG9ydHVuaXR5LUFuYWx5c2lzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159B8AFCB50>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nbG9iZW5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2UvMjAyMi8wOC8yNC8yNTAzNTI2LzI4MTI0L2VuL1dvcmxkd2lkZS1CYXJjb2RlLVByaW50ZXItSW5kdXN0cnktdG8tMjAzMC1TaXplLVNoYXJlLU91dGxvb2stYW5kLU9wcG9ydHVuaXR5LUFuYWx5c2lzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5zcGFja2FnaW5nLmNvbS9uZXdzL2ltY2QtYWNxdWlyZXMtcHJvbWFwbGFzdC10by1leHBhbmQtaW4tYWR2YW5jZWQtbWF0ZXJpYWxzLW1hcmtldC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IMCD México acquires materials distributor PromaPlast,"PromaPlast offers a range of resins and compounds to serve the packaging footwear consumer goods home appliances automotive and other industrial markets

Two propositions on the November ballot Proposition 26 and Proposition 27 offer competing visions of legalized sports betting. Each needs to surpass 50% to become law and if they both do the one that gets more votes will win out though litigation is expected in that scenario.

But Chris Curtin whose duties at Bank of America include heading up social media thinks a great place to learn from are the branding efforts of colleges and universities.

Many collegiate brands are masters of branding he says. “They have each created an identity that people apply to be part of” says Curtin. “They apply the brand to themselves while they are there and then they carry that brand with them for the next 40 years or so.”

“Collegiate branding permeates culture it permeates merchandise and even employees and students says Curtin. He suggests that companies could turn their branding into something that employees might carry with them even after leaving creating a sort of “alumni base” of former staff that becomes an extension of the current community.

Curtin’s choice comes after extensive experience in branding and social at several blue-chip companies. He arrived at BofA in April 2022 as SVP and Head of Digital Social and Rewards after a seven-year stint at Visa ultimately as its chief brand and innovation marketing officer. Before that he served in marketing and innovation posts for Hewlett-Packard and The Walt Disney Company.

Yet Curtin’s involvement at Disney didn’t begin in marketing or innovation at all but with a five-year job in government relations. Curtin has a law degree from Georgetown — law was a family business — but he suggests that marketing is not that far away from the law in a broad sense.

“With hindsight being 20/20 careers make sense looking backwards and rarely make sense looking forward” says Curtin. “But there’s a lot about the law and marketing where skill sets overlap. One such overlap is advocacy. Another is the ability to find a way to articulate arguments in favor of a vantage point.”

Tapping the Power of Social Media for Customers’ Good

Social media platforms aren’t courtrooms but Curtin says there’s considerable power in them that can be used in multiple ways.

“There’s a lot of good that can come from social platforms and channels and there are also risks and concerns” says Curtin. “Social channels can unite the world and advance the world but they can also be abused.”

At its best social media is a marketplace of ideas according to Curtin and financial marketers need to think of this ahead of the goal to push product.

“You have to think about the ‘social’ part long before you get to the word ‘media.’ There should be a sharing of ideas thoughts perceptions and beliefs where people can sift out the best insights.”

—Chris Curtin Bank of America

This comes down to creating content large and small that provokes thinking and Curtin says he encourages his social team to work towards content that is responsive to what is on people’s minds. This entails observation and listening before sending messages — and not getting sucked into every bit of noise trending on social channels.

“I start with ‘What is the world talking about?’ ‘What are they sharing?’ ‘What are they tweeting?’ ‘What are they posting?’ ‘What’s the zeitgeist of the world today? That’s the starting place.” Then he continues the question is where and how does that intersect with what Bank of America does?

Right now consumers and businesses are still acclimating to a severe change in circumstances with inflation higher rates and the potential for a recession in mind.

“People are looking to trusted sources to provide guidance and thought leadership not just products and solutions” says Curtin. “They want thought leadership regarding where we are today where we could be tomorrow and what the best path forward is.”

Because of this while BofA does promote products through social a common thread on the platforms it uses has been educational. The stress is on practical perspectives on how to make it through tougher times.

Using Each Social Platform’s Strengths to Send BofA Messages

Some financial institutions treat social media as a set of interchangeable pipes all of which carry social media “water.”

That’s a mistake according to Curtin. “I don’t believe each platform and channel is just another street to drive down. The best brands approach them for what they are and use what they offer to best advantage.”

Underscoring this Curtin adds: “One of the reasons the big brands have built audiences of the size they have is because they are not facsimiles of their competitors. It would be narrow-sighted for a brand to sit back and say ‘This content works in radio therefore it works on social. Or that what works on Pinterest is going to work as well on Twitter.”

An example of applying this approach is an effort BofA has on social that uses the occasion of a wedding — the same wedding — very differently depending on the social platform.

On YouTube below the viewer zooms in on a couple dancing at the wedding. The woman speaks to the audience and points out all the people around the room who are using a moment here and there during the reception to check something on their BofA mobile banking app.

At the end of the spot her partner asks “Who are you talking to?” Nobody she replies.

In a Pinterest treatment of the same wedding above five different characters — the bride a cousin who forgot to bring a present a waiter pouring champagne into tiers of goblets a saxophonist whose credit card has been compromised and a woman checking her balance while dancing — all use the app.

On Instagram a woman offers her commentary in slices tailored to this platform’s style.

Treating Followers Like A Valued Audience

Marketers can speak so much in terms of “eyeballs” that it’s possible to forget that there are people attached to them. Curtin thinks a financial brand that has amassed millions of followers has established an obligation to them that demands what he calls “white-glove service.”

He adds that followers are an asset that should be treated as such.

“This is a community that has expressed to you that they care about you. They want to hear from you. They want to know what’s new about you. And they want to have your voice potentially shape some of their actions and decisions.

“That’s a community you should be looking to first. You should be thinking that before you speak to anyone else you want to make sure that those people along with your customers hear from your directly.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbmtyYXRlLmNvbS9maW5hbmNlL2NyZWRpdC1jYXJkcy9ob3ctdG8tZ2V0LXByZS1hcHByb3ZlZC1mb3ItYmFuay1vZi1hbWVyaWNhLWNyZWRpdC1jYXJkcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How To Get Preapproved For A Bank Of America Credit Card,"Advertiser Disclosure

Bank of America class action overview:

Who: A Bank of America credit card customer is suing the company.

Why: The customer says the bank does not properly investigate unauthorized card use claims and instead places liability for such transactions

Where: The lawsuit was filed in a Hawaii federal court.

Bank of America (BoA) does not properly investigate unauthorized card use claims and instead places liability for such transactions on its customers a new class action lawsuit alleges.

Plaintiff Ji-Hye Park filed a complaint against Bank of America N.A. Aug. 18 in a Hawaii federal court alleging violations of the Truth in Lending Act.

According to her lawsuit Park received a “fraud alert” text message from Bank of America in January asking whether she had used her bank card for three attempted transactions one of which was approved on her card for $2000.

Park says she replied to her bank saying she had not authorized the transaction however BoA still posted two $2000 charges to her account that were unauthorized. She disputed the charges and a $4000 credit was issued however she says the charges were reposted to her account about a month later with no explanation given.

Later disputing the transactions again BoA told Park that a company named Axus provided documentation confirming she received its services. When she asked to see the documents she said they were “scattered” and unconvincing.

“Most notably the documents identified the plaintiff’s IP address… as ‘Taipei Taiwan.’ Plaintiff of course lives in Hawaii” the lawsuit states. “She also has never been to Taiwan or used her Bank of America credit card there.”

BoA didn’t do due diligence in investigation lawsuit alleges

Park alleges that BOA didn’t do its due diligence in investigating the fraud instead relying “blindly” on documents furnished by Axus.

In doing this the bank violated Section 1643 of the Truth in Lending Act which prohibits credit card issuers from holding cardholders responsible for unauthorized charges “without complying with specific requirements” she says.

“Bank of America refuses to undertake any meaningful investigation because shifting the loss to the cardholder is more cost-effective than ruling for the cardholder and risking a prolonged dispute with the merchant” the complaint states.

The city was founded in the first century by the Romans who used its natural hot springs as a thermal spa. But a dip in those steaming waters in an elaborately engineered underground temple dedicated to Minerva goddess of healing is off limits to visitors who wander through the historic site today.

At the Cleveland Pools however you can once again take the plunge. This equally impressive water complex was built in 1815 and continuously used for bathing until 1984. Following a nearly £10-million restoration the complex believed to be the oldest surviving outdoor public swimming pool in the United Kingdom reopened to the public in the fall. Its main attraction is a large curvilinear pool originally reserved for male bathers who had been banned from swimming nude in the adjacent river.

Cleveland Pools can only be reached on foot through the scenic trails of a quiet residential cul-de-sac which contributes to its somewhat secret status. Travelling there takes you through layers of Saxon medieval and Tudor architecture and most notably neoclassical Palladian buildings constructed during the 18th century under the reign of George III. Accented with honey-coloured limestone pediments and Corinthian pilasters these landmarks give the city its distinctive glow even in the pouring rain.

The direct 90-minute train from London Paddington means that Bath population 100000 sees a significant influx of visitors particularly for weekend getaways. Many of those tourists come to town to experience the waters and the historic cityscape to follow in the literary footsteps of Mary Shelley (who wrote much of her landmark gothic Frankenstein while attending lectures in town) and Jane Austen (who lived here briefly) and to hop between filming locations of Netflix’s blockbuster Regency-era series Bridgerton. Lately the city is also becoming a destination for fans of a branch of contemporary British design that’s anchored in history.

Bath’s influx of weekenders also includes more than a few hen and stag parties which is why during my visit in October I opted to stay in Bathwick. It’s a quiet area on the opposite bank of the River Avon and only a 10-minute stroll across neoclassical Pulteney Bridge from the bustling city centre. I enjoyed coming and going along Great Pulteney Street a wide formal avenue flanked by the unspoiled Georgian architecture of luxurious terraced townhouses.

Open this photo in gallery: Holburne Museum Bath's first public art gallery and former home of Sir Thomas Holburne.

At its east end is the Holburne Museum. Doubling as the stately residence of Bridgerton’s formidable Lady Danbury in real life it’s the onetime home of Sir Thomas Holburne a lifelong collector of quirky miniatures old masters and objets d’art he later bequeathed to the city. A recent exhibition was devoted to painter Gwen John whose reputation only emerged out the imposing shadow of her artist brother Augustus and lover Auguste Rodin after her death in 1939.

Great Pulteney Street is only one of the city’s architectural set pieces. The Circus a round residential street of townhouses from 1754 is another masterpiece of graceful urban planning. Its streetscape overflows ornamentation in the forms of friezes decorative emblems and triglyphs. The curving Palladian façades of nearby Royal Crescent overlook the vast Royal Victoria Park lawn. Among them No. 1 is the city’s most prestigious address housing a museum styled entirely in the Georgian manner (and doubling as another Bridgerton backdrop the Featherington family’s abode).

The Assembly Rooms referenced by Austen was one of the legendary dance halls at the heart of aristocratic socializing in her day and it still drips with crystal chandeliers and ornate mouldings. During a visit you can practically hear the gossiping ghosts of socialites past. At the nearby Jane Austen Centre those ghosts are in fact real-life guides costumed in Regency garb who lead tours in character.

All this history – and occasional kitsch – forms the groundwork for the contemporary designers galleries and quirky shops that draw on the city’s heritage values. Nowhere is this more in evidence than at the influential design boutique Berdoulat. Based in Margaret’s Buildings a historic pedestrian street lined with independent design shops Berdoulat is Patrick Williams’s architectural design practice which specializes in period building restoration. It’s also the three-storey Georgian shopfront he co-founded with his wife Turkish and Bulgarian photographer Neri Williams.

The wood countertops brass scales and antique apothecary jars are heirlooms just as Berdoulat’s many tableware and interior accessory collaborations with local artisans will eventually become. From cutlery baskets by Bath’s Willow pottery to canelé-shaped ceiling fixtures by Devon ceramicist Feldspar all its pieces are designed in collaboration with regional makers. The simple refectory tables lipped bowls and oak egg racks highlight craft and epitomize beautility the latest buzzword for functional home essentials in modest materials.

As someone who thrills at the archaic terminology of estate interiors – think “boot rooms” “butler’s pantries” and anything featuring the word “scullery” – the new DeVOL Kitchens showroom tucked in the corner of a historic building block nearby is a twofold pleasure. The firm specializes in (and popularized) handmade kitchen furniture inspired by historic home aesthetics that fuse classic unfitted Georgian and farmhouse styles with modern conveniences. The copper worktops Shaker wainscotting aged brass taps slatted plate racks and fluted marble bib sinks of the three atmospheric showroom kitchens are swoon-worthy – and could easily have been plucked out of any of the high-ceilinged townhouses on the street.

Niche bookshop and publisher Persephone Books sits next door in the Edgar Buildings. It was established 25 years ago to excavate a more recent history: neglected works (mostly by women) from the mid-20th century. As much as I adore Austen Persephone is the reason I’ve come to Bath: a pilgrimage to the bookshop that has unearthed so many of my favourite reads. The publisher’s attention to design detail rivals that of its neighbours. The vestibule and fixtures are done up in the same signature dove grey as its books each with individual endpapers reproducing period textiles and wallpapers chosen to complement the material. A period upholstery fabric for example lines an edition of the once-forgotten 1938 charmer Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day by Winifred Watson that is Persephone’s perennial bestseller.

Among the cluster of well-curated art and antique shops up the hill Francis Gallery is set inside another of these heritage-listed Georgian townhouses with wood furnishings and plinths in tonal shades of ecru arranged like a living space. Korean-Canadian founder and director Rosa Park grew up in Vancouver. Prior to opening the gallery (which also has an outpost in Los Angeles) to present the work of emerging international artists she created Cereal an acclaimed indie magazine about travel and lifestyle. The space is as warm and understated as her magazine pages with diffused lighting like something out of a Hammershøi painting adding to the moodiness of the ghostly Krista Mezzadri monotype prints on show when I visited.

Retracing my steps to explore an area around the railway station I took the invigorating waters of a different kind at Bath Botanical Gin Distillery & Herbal Apothecary the passion project of medical herbalist Sue Mullett. As a one-woman operation its hours are limited but I stopped by at just the right time to sample the micro-distillery’s offerings of boozy small-batch tonics inspired by traditional apothecary tinctures. Mullett’s crisply refreshing No.1 Gin is the only authentically Bath-produced gin and every wax-sealed bottle comes out of the copper still that is the petite room’s centrepiece. It is yet another example of how Bath’s modern sense of craft and culture flourishes because of the reverence for the city’s history.

Text description provided by the architects. Jocheon is a small village on the northeastern coast of Jeju. It is a seaside village known as a great place to see the sunrise every day. To the north is the blue sea of Jocheon and freshwater springs from the ground near the beach. Jocheon has been a clean and abundant village with clean spring water which was used by the people for washing and drinking before the waterworks were installed. This plot of land silently watching over the sea is about 18 square meters in size and is on the boundary between the beach of Jocheon and the freshwater springs.

This was a place for the travelers to begin and end their day. So what did it have to offer? We focused on the element of ‘water’ as harbored by the beach of Jocheon. We wanted the most daily element to give the most non-daily experience in this space. ‘Taking a bath’ is a very simple and daily action yet a powerful ritual of rearranging one’s mind and relieving the physical and mental fatigue. The Chinese character for bath is 浴 (Yok).

It represents the pouring water and means to clean the wastes with the force of water flowing downwards. We planned this space to be a place for relaxing and recharging focusing on the acts of washing and wiping in a space filled with various forms of water such as pouring water gushing water still water gazing water and steam.

The Jocheon Yokjang is a small bath place consisting of 3 floors that are about 15 square meters each. The building was designed to be within 50 square meters without a parking area so that the yard can be used more widely and it is a private space for only 2 people. The 3rd floor is a bathing space with an ocean view and various washing experiences. The 2nd floor is the bedroom and the 1st floor is the kitchen. The vertical concrete building is only open on the sides that come in contact with nature.

A federal judge in Chicago ruled that BD’s PhaSeal system for transporting hazardous drugs between syringes and vials doesn’t infringe two patents belonging to Baxter.

U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow granted BD summary judgment on two patent claims and resolved all claims in its favor. She denied BD’s motion for summary judgment on willfulness and damages as moot. She also denied Baxter’s motion for partial summary judgment as moot terminating the case.

Baxter had alleged that the combination of two components of the PhaSeal system — the “protector” and “injector” — form a device that infringes on three of its patents each entitled “Sliding Reconstitution Device With Seal.”

Lefkow said in the decision that the PhaSeal system doesn’t violate Baxter’s patent rights in the “reconstitution” device for diluting liquid drugs. The judge concluded that the patents weren’t violated because components for the PhaSeal system aren’t purchased in an infringing manner as they can be used for purposes beyond “reconstitution.”

Reuters first reported on the decision yesterday. According to the outlet the suit dates back to 2017 and BD and its CareFusion subsidiary still face a separate patent case from Baxter regarding the Alaris infusion pump system. Alaris faces its own issues mostly over recalls with the most recent setback coming in the form of a shareholder lawsuit against BD over communications of company performance amid the recalls.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iaW9zcGFjZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9yZWxlYXNlcy9kaWFiZXRlcy10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWxlYWRlci1hbmQtZ2xvYmFsLWJ1c2luZXNzLWV4ZWN1dGl2ZS1kb3VnLWxhd3JlbmNlLWpvaW5zLWh5Z2llaWEtYXMtY2VvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Diabetes Technology Leader and Global Business Executive Doug Lawrence Joins Hygieia as CEO,"LIVONIA Mich.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Hygieia Inc. a digital therapeutics company for insulin therapy has appointed Doug Lawrence its chief executive officer responsible for leading operations development and global growth of the company and its d-Nav® Insulin Management Program.

Berkshire Hathaway’s (BKR) share price soared to a record high this year – but will the increases persuade the company to split its stock?

The conglomerate run by billionaire investor Warren Buffett enjoyed an impressive start to 2022 despite global uncertainties. The strong performance has made investors question whether the company could follow fellow corporate giants like Amazon and Tesla in carrying out a BRK stock split.

Here we take a look at the company’s stock price history consider the pros and cons of stock splits and ask analysts what they expect to happen over the coming months.

What is Berkshire Hathaway?

Berkshire Hathaway is a holding company based in Omaha Nebraska US that’s involved in a wide variety of areas including insurance real estate and energy. Its chairman and CEO is Warren Buffett whose investment success over many decades has led to him being dubbed the ‘Sage of Omaha’.

In his most recent letter to shareholders Buffett pointed out that the company’s shareholders own many dozens of businesses.

“Some of these in turn have a collection of subsidiaries of their own” he wrote. “For example Marmon has more than 100 individual business operations ranging from the leasing of railroad cars to the manufacture of medical devices.”

Currently its largest holdings include a cluster of insurers technology giant Apple (AAPL) US freight railroad operator BNSF Railway and energy holding company Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BNE).

Berkshire Hathaway: How has it performed?

It’s been a good year for Berkshire Hathaway with investors attracted by its mix of reliable trusted companies at a time of global uncertainty. The company has two classes of common stock designated as Class A and Class B which are both listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

Berkshire’s A-class stock is the original stock. It is the world’s most expensive share having closed at $447154 on 19 August 2022. It reached an all-time high of $539180 on 28 March 2022 just over 20% higher than its current level.

The price of the more affordable B-class shares stood at $297.28 as the market closed on 19 August 2022. The all-time high for this stock was $359.57 on the same date in March.

According to a recent broker note from Greggory Warren a sector strategist at Morningstar the shares are “modestly undervalued”. As of 23 August he had a fair value rating of $537000 a share on the A-shares and $357 on the B-shares.

What is a stock split?

A stock split is a corporate action that involves the division of each of a company’s shares into multiple shares which increases the total stock in the company. This has the effect of revaluing the price per share. The company’s overall market capitalisation does not change.

For example if an investor owns 100 shares valued at $50 each the total value of their investment is $5000. If the company splits its stock by 2 the investor will own 200 shares but each will only be worth $25. Their total investment will still be worth $5000.

Stock splits: Good or bad news?

There are a number of reasons why a company may look to split its stock according to Susannah Streeter senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown:

“Dividing the shares into smaller units can increase demand for the shares making an individual share a little more affordable for individual investors.”

Lower share prices are also useful when it comes to remunerating staff with share options which is often used to incentivise employees.

“A company might want to give a junior member of staff a bonus in shares worth a few thousand pounds or dollars but if the share price is too high then it can’t do that very easily.”

Streeter also pointed out a soaring stock price can present other challenges noting that “in more extreme cases a high share price can also make mergers and acquisitions more difficult”.

So is a stock split good news or bad? Well the overall value of shares won’t change after a stock split apart from the usual market movements. The only discernible difference as far as an investor is concerned according to Streeter will be that the number of shares they own will have gone up.

“A little extra demand for the shares might make a slight difference to the share price and the split has probably made life a little easier for management but stock splits don’t change the intrinsic value of a company or your shareholding” added Streeter.

Berkshire Hathaway’s stock split history: What has happened?

What is the BRK stock split history? This is a slightly complicated question as Berkshire Hathaway has two classes of common stock designated as A-class and B-class. Buffett has never sanctioned the splitting of A-class shares as he believes this would go against his buy-and-hold investment philosophy.

However the company introduced B-class shares in 1995 after the share price soared above $30000 prompting him to face longer-term concerns. In his letter to shareholders that year Buffett explained the new class was a response to the “threatened creation of unit trusts” that would have marketed themselves as Berkshire lookalikes.

“In the process they would have used our past and definitely non-repeatable record to entice naïve small investors and would have charged these innocents high fees and commissions” he wrote.

So when did Berkshire Hathaway stock split?

The B-class shares were split in January 2010. At the time they were around $3500 which put them out of many investors’ reach.

Berkshire shareholders approved a 50-for-1 stock split as a way to improve accessibility to potential investors. The stock price subsequently went down to around $66.

Berkshire Hathaway stock split: Will it follow others?

A number of corporate giants have split their stock this year. Back in March Amazon (AMZN) revealed a 20-for-1 stock split in filings to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The split the fourth since the company went public in 1997 saw Amazon shareholders receive 19 additional shares for each one held.

In mid-July Alphabet (GOOG) the parent company of Google executed a stock split for the second time in the company’s history. The 20-for-1 split which comes just over eight years since the previous such action meant investors received an additional 19 shares for every one they owned.

The most recent addition to this list is Tesla (TSLA). The electric vehicle manufacturer (EV) announced in early August a three-for-one split to make stock ownership more accessible to employees and investors. Each stockholder of record on 17 August will receive two additional shares for each one they hold.

What do the analysts predict?

How likely is another Berkshire Hathaway stock split? Is the company likely to follow the route taken by other major companies and split the stock this year?

It’s not very likely according to Streeter who doesn’t expect Buffett to sign off on a stock split any time soon.

“I haven’t seen any reason to expect a stock split for Berkshire Hathaway” she told Capital.com. “Its shares have been trading higher than this current level and it did not prompt a split.”

Whether a split would ever be on the cards could depend on the company’s overall aims and objectives according to Streeter.

“Stock splits don’t alter the overall value of the shares an investor owns” she said. “They’re designed to attract new investors. That does not seem to have been a priority for Berkshire Hathaway.”

Only 12 people attended the annual meeting of Warren Buffett's company Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.78%) (BRK.B 0.64%) back in 1965. But the number has grown a bit: According to Reuters it hit 1000 in 1986 13000 in 2000 21000 in 2005 and a whopping 42000 in 2015 -- the 50th anniversary of Buffett being at the helm of the company.

Buffett is turning 92 in August and his longtime business partner Charlie Munger is 98 and they're still presiding over the annual meetings which are sometimes referred to as ""Woodstock for capitalists."" If you're wondering what the attraction is for so many attendees here are some answers.

The annual movie

While many companies' annual meetings last an hour or two at most Berkshire meetings last all day. The doors typically open at 7 a.m. -- which is when many thousands of people who have been waiting in line outside (some since the early hours of the morning) get to rush in and grab seats in the CHI Health Center which has an arena seating more than 18000. (There are designated overflow areas as well.)

The first formal event of the meeting is the annual movie which is always an entertaining 45-minute (or so) montage of commercials for various Berkshire companies and investments (such as GEICO and Coca-Cola) with segments featuring Buffett Munger and often some celebrities interspersed within it. There's also always a tribute to the managers of all the companies Berkshire owns with each of them named and their photo shown and each year's movie also includes a clip from 1991 of Buffett testifying before Congress regarding the Salomon scandal. Buffett had been brought in to lead the company temporarily following a scandal and he stressed that the company would comply with regulators and investigators and that he expected integrity from employees because the company's reputation could take no hit.

A warm welcome

Warren Buffett likes to point out that the company's shareholders are co-owners of it -- as are any shareholders of publicly traded companies -- and he treats them accordingly. Those who send in an order form for (free) ""credentials"" to admit them to the meeting receive a printed guide that offers details on the meeting. It also offers a lot of information on Omaha hotels restaurants and attractions along with details on other Berkshire events such as an evening reception at the massive Borsheim's jewelry store and the annual Brooks-sponsored 5K race.

Shopping

Another big attraction for many attendees is simply shopping. The CHI Health Center along with previous venues for the meeting features a massive space for exhibitors and most of Berkshire's subsidiaries are there selling wares and/or sharing displays and information. You can buy Dairy Queen ice cream Fruit of the Loom t-shirts and underwear Brooks shoes GEICO insurance Pampered Chef cookware chocolates from See's boots from Justin's and much more. Many shareholders shop on the Friday before the meeting and many shop during the meeting.

There's also shopping to be had at the huge Nebraska Furniture Mart and Borsheim's jewelry store each of which offer special discounts to shareholders.

Buffett and Munger answer questions for hours

The main event of course is this: Buffett and Munger answer questions for more than five hours -- often tackling around 60 or so in total. The questions include those from shareholders stationed at microphones around the arena and those emailed in to one or more journalists asking them of Buffett.

Some questioners ask for advice on leading a good and successful life (after all these are successful and happy nonagenarians) while many ask for investing guidance or for insight into Berkshire's business. The fact that Buffett and Munger spend so much time answering questions reflects the respect they have for their shareholders.

Should you attend?

So -- should you attend or at least tune in to the live webcast? Consider doing so. The meetings with both Buffett and Munger may not go on for too many years as they're both no longer spring chickens.

Going in person to Omaha can be best. (Book your hotel room early and perhaps airfare too!) The 2023 meeting will be held on Saturday May 6. Note that many well-known value investors attend each year and many of them host gatherings over the weekend too. If you follow or invest with any perhaps look into what events you might attend.

But while the news does not concern Bitcoin (BTC) directly it may still be a clue to the downside potential for its price in the short term.

Berkshire Hathaway seeks safety in T-bills

Treasury bills or T-bills are U.S. government-backed securities that mature in less than a year. Investors prefer them over money-market funds and certificates of deposit because of their tax benefits.

Berkshire’s net cash position was $105 billion as of June 30 out of which $75 billion or 60% was held in T-bills up from $58.53 billion at the beginning of 2022 out of its $144 billion total cash reserves.

The move is likely a response to bond yields jumping massively since August 2021 in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s hawkish policies aimed at curbing inflation which was running at 8.4% in July.

For instance the three-month U.S. T-bill returned a 2.8% yield on Aug. 22 compared with a near-zero yield a year ago. Similarly the yield on the U.S. one-year T-bill climbed from zero to 3.35% in the same period.

Meanwhile non-yielding assets like gold and Bitcoin have dropped roughly by 2.5% and 57% respectively since August 2021. The U.S. stock market benchmark S&P 500 likewise saw a decline losing nearly 7.5% in the same period.

Such a difference in performance presents T-bills as an ultra-safe alternative for investors compared with gold Bitcoin and stocks. Buffett’s T-bill strategy suggests the same namely a bet on more downside for risk-on assets in the near term — particularly as the Fed gears up for more rate hikes.

“Buffett is a value investor so he won’t allocate much when the equity markets are as overvalued as they have been for the last five years” Charles Edwards founder of quantitative crypto fund Capriole Investments told Cointelegraph.

Meanwhile Andrew Bary an associate editor at Barron’s underscored the market’s potential to tail Buffett’s strategy saying:

“Individual investors may want to consider following Buffett’s lead now that they are yielding as much as 3%.”

Bitcoin: Safe haven or risk-on?

The risks of positive-yielding debts are dampening the demand for other potential safe havens Bitcoin included. In other words increasingly risk-averse investors could be opting for assets that offer fixed yields over those that don’t.

The performance of Bitcoin-focused investment funds in August supports this argument with capital outflows for three weeks in a row including a $15.3 million exit in the week ending Aug. 19.

Overall these funds have lost $44.7 million on a month-to-date basis according to CoinShares’ weekly report. In total digital asset investment products including BTC have witnessed month-to-date outflows totaling $22.2 million.

Does that mean Bitcoin will continue to lose its sheen against positive-yielding U.S. government debts? Edwards disagrees.

“Allocation to Treasurys and other low-yield cash products is really a decision that needs to be made case-by-case depending on an individual’s goals and risk appetite” he explained adding:

“In the short-term there are times it makes sense to hedge against Bitcoin’s volatility with cash the best cash being the U.S. dollar. But in the long term I think all fiat currencies tend toward zero against Bitcoin.”

Edwards also pointed out that Buffett's long-term strategy remains largely risk-on. Notably Berkshire deployed 34% of its cash holdings to buy equities in May and over 70% of its portfolio is still made up of risk-on assets.

“Looking at Buffett’s 75% risk allocation and knowing that Bitcoin has been the best-performing asset of all asset classes in the last decade having the highest risk-adjusted returns I know where I would be putting my money” he added.

Buffett’s portfolio however will likely continue to eschew direct BTC investment as the ""Oracle of Omaha” remains a fierce critic. In February 2020 he said that it “does not create anything” adding:

“I don’t own any cryptocurrency. I never will. […] You can’t do anything with it except sell it to somebody else.”

Earlier this year however Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway increased itsexposure to a Bitcoin-friendly neobank while reducing its stake in Visa and Mastercard.

That’s usually a challenge in New York City when buying a place to rent out means you’re up against lots of competition from buyers who are shopping for a primary residence.

But this is a very unusual and interesting moment to invest in NYC residential real estate. Sales are turning out to be “absolutely dead” this summer because buyers are scared—they’re waiting out rising mortgage rates and current economic instability by parking themselves in the rental market. That’s sending rents soaring: The average monthly rent for a Manhattan apartment hit a new record high of $5000 in June according to the Elliman Report. Both factors work in your favor if you’re buying a condo to rent out (co-ops are not well-suited for investors because of restrictions on sublets and boards' traditional antipathy toward investor-owners).

[Editor's note: This article was originally published in July 2022. We are presenting it again here as part of our summer Best of Brick week.]

“People don’t like to make decisions when things are unstable” Kobi Lahav senior managing director at Living New York previously told Brick. “It feels like the world is going to hell so now is not the time” to buy. But buyers are “willing to pay more for rentals. It feels more flexible and they’re willing to pay a premium” he says.

Most investors are “savvy and happy to buy right now” he says calling now “the best time to negotiate.” An offer that’s 8 to 10 percent lower than asking is no longer considered insulting. “Just a month ago if you put a low offer in a broker wouldn’t even respond. Now they’re texting back” Lahav says.

So ok you’re sold on buying in NYC. That leaves the important question: Which neighborhoods should you consider buying in?

One tactic is to see where renters are hunting for apartments. According to Allia Mohamed CEO of rental listings and building review platform openigloo since May 2022 there has been an increase in searches for the Upper East Side Lower East Side and the East Village. In the months before May the top searched neighborhoods were the Upper West Side West Village and Chelsea. A lack of listings among popular West Side Manhattan neighborhoods “drove renters to search elsewhere” she says.

For more intel Brick spoke to brokers about how to strategize your search as an investor including which neighborhoods attract young renters places where inventory is limited where to hunt for new development and areas where you can get a deal. Here’s what they had to say.

Buy where young renters want to be

Lower East Side East Village Bushwick and Bed-Stuy

Even though they suffered during the pandemic and haven’t yet fully recovered the Lower East Side and the East Village are still top choices for young renters who like the authentic ""gritty"" feel of living Downtown Lahav says.

He says prices on the Lower East Side “took a major hit” and the neighborhood has “problems with homeless and retail hasn’t returned.” If you’re thinking “ugh”—then you don’t get the appeal.

“Rents are through the roof. People will pay a lot of rent here” Lahav says pointing out how easy it is to get from the LES to other hot destinations. “They’re willing to pay $5500 a month because the same place would be $7000 or $8000 in Soho.”

The East Village—which also is near lots of places that appeal to a young renter—is also a good choice for an investor. Lahav says prices there have also “taken a beating” and can give an investor a “really nice return.”

The pandemic put a crimp in the ongoing gentrification for the Lower East Side’s Alphabet City—and the same holds true for Brooklyn neighborhoods like Bushwick and Bed-Stuy.

“Bushwick prices started coming down but rents are going through the roof” Lahav says making the neighborhood another example of a place buyers can find a good deal. Bed-Stuy is also seeing lower prices “but rents have never been higher. Like Bushwick it has bars restaurants and is close to the subway” he says. Plus it’s likely to see more development.

Buy somewhere where inventory is limited and unique

Tribeca and the West Village

New Yorkers (and those that want to live here) have strong even illogical preferences for certain neighborhoods says Vickey Barron a broker at Compass.

“Most people are neighborhood specific” she says. “Even people relocating to NYC for jobs people who never lived here before already have a preconceived idea of where they want to be.”

With that in mind her advice to investors is to buy where there’s less inventory and lots of demand: The West Village and Tribeca.

For example if you search StreetEasy for one bedrooms for sale—you’ll find there are currently 33 in Tribeca 55 in the West Village and on the Upper East Side—over 470. Rentals in these neighborhoods show a similar disparity leaving you with less competition for renters if you stick to Tribeca and the West Village.

“When you invest in something unique and what you have is not easy to find you bring value” Barron says.

The East Village and the West Village both have “around 150 properties available making competition a bit stiffer and prices less negotiable. Still the rental rates in these neighborhoods are some of the highest in the city and should yield investors a strong return” says Garrett Derderian director of market intelligence at SERHANT.

A client of Kimberly Jay’s a broker at Compass recently bought in the West Village a neighborhood she describes as likely the most desirable neighborhood with the lowest number of units available.

“My buyer purchased a one-bedroom condo for $1700000 and we quickly rented the unit for $7000 a month” she says.

Buy in new development with lots of amenities

Downtown Brooklyn Fort Greene Dumbo Williamsburg and Clinton Hill

For many New Yorkers renting in a new development is a way to get nicer finishes and amenities that they could not otherwise afford if they were buying says Gerard Splendore a broker at Coldwell Banker Warburg.

“Renters are drawn to new shiny developments with amenities and perks. Gyms pools roof decks and doormen are catnip to renters who may not be able to afford to purchase apartments in buildings with ‘glamorous’ perks” Splendore says.

These renters want apartments with washer/drivers terraces spa-like baths and “impressive kitchens even if they do not cook” he says.

Head to downtown Brooklyn near the Brooklyn Academy of Music Fort Greene and Dumbo for neighborhoods attractive to renters who want new development and look at buildings surrounding the Barclays Center in Brooklyn a shopping entertainment and transportation hub.

Derderian suggests investors check out Brooklyn Point a condo tower with a long list of luxury perks.

The building “not only offers a convenient location with multiple transit options but also has one of the last 25-year tax abatements available in the city. By purchasing in a building with an abatement the carrying costs for the buyers are significantly reduced while still commanding a high rent” he says.

Downtown Brooklyn Williamsburg Greenpoint and Clinton Hill draw high-earning young professionals who are putting off ownership because of the economy says Seth Levin a broker at Keller Williams NYC.

“New developments in Downtown Brooklyn are a great place for investors to look. The neighborhood is connected to all major subway lines and amenity rich buildings are garnering top rents. The returns are higher than what we are typically accustomed to here in NYC” Levin says.

There are several condo buildings in Williamsburg and Greenpoint that still have a few years left on their tax abatements presenting opportunity for investors he adds. “Two-bedroom condos that would trade close to $2000 per foot in comparable Manhattan buildings are trading around $1350 per foot.”

Finally Levin says “we really like Clinton Hill as well since it is priced below neighboring Prospect Heights and Fort Greene. Inventory is scarce and rents are similar to higher-priced Brooklyn locales.”

Buy where you can get a discount

Washington Heights Central Harlem Yorkville Hell’s Kitchen and Midtown East

If you’re an investor looking for a more affordable apartment Derderian suggests Yorkville on the Upper East Side.

“Since the expansion of the Q train more renters have flocked to the neighborhood. Currently there are just under 400 homes available for sale with a median asking price of $998000. Values have held steady increasing 0.3 percent from last year” he says. (Compare that to Lenox Hill the neighborhood just to the south where the median asking price in the neighborhood $1900000 is up 2 percent year-over-year.)

Another relatively more affordable neighborhood to consider is Hell’s Kitchen. Derderian says listings here have increased 13 percent year-over-year to nearly 350 homes for sale.

“As one of the more affordable options south of 59th Street there is opportunity for investors looking at both resales and new developments. Proximity to the Theater District and Midtown offices are also a benefit especially as the city more fully looks like its pre-pandemic self” he says.

New developments offer investors negotiability and the ability to achieve high rent Levin says.

“We just listed a new development unit for one of our investor clients in Midtown East for $14000 per month. Within days we had multiple offers and just accepted one above our ask. A couple years ago we wouldn't have imagined that this could rent above $10000 per month. We were able to negotiate the purchase price on that particular unit down more than 10 percent from its asking price which was around $4000000.

“Luxury two-bedroom inventory in particular in these neighborhoods is incredibly low right now and prospective tenants are not balking at the asking rents” he says.

Consider the frenzy over a studio represented by Michael Biryla an agent at The Agency who listed apartment #3C at 342 East 53rd St. The studio had 25 showings and received six offers he says. The apartment was asking $325000 and ended up in contract for $5000 over the asking price.

Co-ops like this in Midtown East are desirable because they’re within walking distance of many office buildings. “Lot of companies are going hybrid” and workers want to live nearby even if they’re only going to the office some days Biryla says.

With that sort of desirability in mind this studio “could be rented out at $3000 tomorrow” Biryla says.

Prices in Central Harlem are “a little soft” compared to prime Manhattan but rents are on rise says Douglas Wagner manager of brokerage services at BOND New York. Prior to 2019 you didn't see rents above $4000 but that’s changed with new buildings going up in the area from 125th to 155th streets where a two bedroom can rent for $4200-$4500 and a three bedroom can get $5000 to $6500 he says.

For some investors it “may be an opportunity that didn’t exist a year ago” Wagner says. “If you can buy an apartment for $400000 to $500000 those rents makes sense.”

Farther north in Washington Heights is 1950 Amsterdam a new building which recently launched sales. A studio here starts at $405000 and could rent for $2400. The building wasn’t there before the pandemic and is benefiting from the “ripple effect” of people being priced out of other neighborhoods he says.

“You wouldn’t see the space or finishes 20 or 30 blocks south for the same price. You don’t see studios in the low $40000s on the Upper West Side unless they’re in co-op buildings that are 50 years or older” he says.

The final word on choosing a neighborhood

Look beyond the building you are considering buying in—and think about what the future holds Barron advises.

The private-equity firm Blackstone Group bought a minority stake in Sunstone Hotel Investors which owns and operates 15 U.S. hotels according to financial documents filed last week.

The investment was notable less for its size than what it indicated about market trends. Blackstone bought about 8.65 million shares in the small publicly traded Aliso Viejo California-based hotel real-estate investment trust.

Blackstone’s move gave it control of about 4 percent of shares outstanding and made the firm one of the five largest shareholders as of June 30. Sunstone’s largest investors such as BlackRock Vanguard and StateStreet have invested passively holding the stock in their mutual funds and other offerings.

Blackstone and Sunstone didn’t respond to requests for comment.

While small Sunstone owns full-service hotels under the Marriott Hilton and Hyatt brands in popular locations such as the Montage Healdsburg resort in California wine country. It has carried out nearly $700 million in transactions this year including its purchases of the Hilton San Diego Bayfront and the Confidante Miami Beach managed by Hyatt. In comparison $5.3 billion worth of hotels were sold in the second quarter across the U.S said LW Hospitality Advisors.

“Sunstone’s balance sheet is healthy” said a J.P. Morgan research report issued before the Blackstone move. Joseph Greff and other analysts forecast that the company will end the year with its debt only about three times its adjusted earnings.

But Sunstone may only have the capital firepower to make one or two more hotel acquisitions in the next year. The company generated $37.7 million in net income on $251.2 million in revenue in the second quarter.

“It’s better positioned than others to be a likely net buyer over the near term” wrote analysts at Jefferies in a report titled “Locked Loaded and Looking for Targets.” But the Jefferies analysts writing before the Blackstone investment were cautious about the company’s “ability to deploy increased liquidity through the next economic cycle.”

Blackstone’s Puzzling Intentions

The world’s largest private equity firm may see hotels as a category that will be more resilient during economic cycles than other real-estate assets. Hoteliers can adjust rates nightly to adapt to inflation or demand shifts unlike the managers of commercial real estate with long-term tenants.

So Blackstone may be an early leading contender to buy Sunstone and take it private. The firm’s support could grow to enable Sunstone to speed up acquiring hotels while streamlining operations and applying best practices from its other hotel portfolio companies.

Blackstone a veteran real-estate investor has notched many wins with its hotel investments and may be looking for more. An 11-year investment in Hilton led to a tripling of its returns in 2018. Its sale of The Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas was its most profitable investment ever netting the company about $4.1 billion in profit. Earlier this year Blackstone joined Starwood Capital in buying 111 WoodSpring Suites properties from Brookfield Asset Management for $1.5 billion. Last year Blackstone and Starwood Capital bought Extended Stay America chain and its approximately 650 hotels for $6 billion.

Veteran private equity firms such as Blackstone may often have the edge over other hotel investors over the next year because their scale and diversified portfolios may help them complete more hotel company acquisitions despite rising interest rates driving up the price of debt.

On a side note a modest benefit for Blackstone of its ownership stake in Sunstone is that the firm might be better able to cross-sell the software service of Groups360 a platform that helps match meeting planners with venues — that Blackstone Innovations Investments owns a minority stake in. Group travel accounted for 44 percent of Sunstone’s business in the second quarter.

“Group room nights for the third and fourth quarter 2022 are pacing at approximately 82 percent of pre-pandemic levels at an average rate that is 5 percent higher than 2019” said CEO Bryan Giglia on an earnings call this month. “This would imply that our overall group revenue pace for this time period is down only 15 percent from the same time in 2019.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2YzMDdhYThiLWI5MWItNGVlYy1hNDZhLTMwMzFmMTYwYzNjMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Another brick in the Wall Street as Blackstone seeks Pink Floyd catalogue,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.ft.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /content/f307aa8b-b91b-4eec-a46a-3031f160c3c0 (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159BA3CB070>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2YzMDdhYThiLWI5MWItNGVlYy1hNDZhLTMwMzFmMTYwYzNjMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVmaW5hbmNpYWxjYXJlZXJzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2ZpbmFuY2UvcHJpdmF0ZS1lcXVpdHktcGF5LXBlLWdpYW50cy10cGctYmxhY2tzdG9uZS1ra3ItY29tcC1pbi10aGUtdXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How much private equity giants Blackstone Carlyle and KKR pay in the U.S,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVmaW5hbmNpYWxjYXJlZXJzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2ZpbmFuY2UvcHJpdmF0ZS1lcXVpdHktcGF5LXBlLWdpYW50cy10cGctYmxhY2tzdG9uZS1ra3ItY29tcC1pbi10aGUtdXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159BA3C97E0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVmaW5hbmNpYWxjYXJlZXJzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2ZpbmFuY2UvcHJpdmF0ZS1lcXVpdHktcGF5LXBlLWdpYW50cy10cGctYmxhY2tzdG9uZS1ra3ItY29tcC1pbi10aGUtdXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWxmb3JkZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS9waWN0dXJlLWdhbGxlcnkvc3BvcnRzL2hpZ2gtc2Nob29sLzIwMjIvMDgvMjMvcGhvdG9zLWJsYWNrc3RvbmUtdmFsbGV5LXRlY2gtc3Rhci1hdGhsZXRlLWVtbWEtYmFsbGFyZC83ODc5Nzc4MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,photos blackstone valley tech star athlete Emma Ballard,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWxmb3JkZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS9waWN0dXJlLWdhbGxlcnkvc3BvcnRzL2hpZ2gtc2Nob29sLzIwMjIvMDgvMjMvcGhvdG9zLWJsYWNrc3RvbmUtdmFsbGV5LXRlY2gtc3Rhci1hdGhsZXRlLWVtbWEtYmFsbGFyZC83ODc5Nzc4MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159BA3CBA90>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWxmb3JkZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS9waWN0dXJlLWdhbGxlcnkvc3BvcnRzL2hpZ2gtc2Nob29sLzIwMjIvMDgvMjMvcGhvdG9zLWJsYWNrc3RvbmUtdmFsbGV5LXRlY2gtc3Rhci1hdGhsZXRlLWVtbWEtYmFsbGFyZC83ODc5Nzc4MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL2xhLzIwMjIvMDgvMjQvYmxhY2tzdG9uZS1zZWxscy1yaXZlcnNpZGUtYXBhcnRtZW50LWNvbXBsZXgtZm9yLTEwMm0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Blackstone Sells Riverside Multifamily Complex for $102M,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL2xhLzIwMjIvMDgvMjQvYmxhY2tzdG9uZS1zZWxscy1yaXZlcnNpZGUtYXBhcnRtZW50LWNvbXBsZXgtZm9yLTEwMm0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159BA3CB010>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL2xhLzIwMjIvMDgvMjQvYmxhY2tzdG9uZS1zZWxscy1yaXZlcnNpZGUtYXBhcnRtZW50LWNvbXBsZXgtZm9yLTEwMm0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

One of the most important reasons to avoid investing in semiconductor stocks is because of industry cyclicity. As technology trends ebb and flow spending on chips in the global economy can be highly volatile. A couple of years of boom time can be followed by sales droughts -- leading to some wild swings in stock prices.

Nevertheless as volatile a space as it might be it's also profitable -- global demand for chips is poised to rise over the next decade. That's why Synopsys (SNPS 0.91%) might be worth a look. It offers the growth of the chip industry but with the more steady predictable financial results of a software business. Here's why it's a top buy right now.

A critical industry partner you've never heard of

Synopsys specializes in what's known as electronic design automation (EDA). EDA is software that helps a semiconductor company design and test chips. Additionally Synopsys also provides chip design templates that a company could license and incorporate into its own custom design. This helps simplify the process of engineering new chips and computing systems by utilizing a tried-and-true blueprint in areas not needing new work.

Synopsys and Cadence Design Systems (CDNS 0.31%) are the top two players in the EDA space although Synopsys says there are other software companies that dabble in this area too. Many chip designers out there also have their own licensing and software businesses -- like Nvidia and Qualcomm for example. Thus some of Synopsys' customers are also competitors.

However due to the subscription software-based nature of its business model Synopsys offers investors far more steady predictable returns than chip companies themselves that rely on final hardware sales. While Synopsys may not be the fastest-growing business in the semiconductor world it hasn't been prone to some of the wild swings in sales other top chip companies have been over the last decade.

Steady growth highly profitable

Besides enjoying steady growth in revenue over time Synopsys is also highly profitable. Over the last 12 months the company has generated $1.58 billion in free cash flow a very healthy free cash flow profit margin of nearly 32%. And as the company expanded over the last decade free cash flow has grown at an even faster rate than revenue. That's exactly the kind of dynamic investors want to see: better operating efficiency as a company scales up.

The company's outlook for fiscal 2022 is solid as well even as the overall chip industry begins to enter a cyclical downturn in some areas (most notably in consumer electronics). Synopsys said it expects revenue to be at least $1.26 billion in its fiscal 2022 fourth quarter up at least 10% year over year.

That expectation will cap off a stellar year for Synopsys. Thanks to a few tuck-in acquisitions and general chip industry growth revenue should exceed $5 billion for the year an increase of nearly 20% from 2021.

Also of note Synopsys reported over $1.5 billion in cash and short-term investments on hand at the end of July offset by minimal debt of just $22 million. In addition to free cash flow generation that provides a nice cushion from which the company can make other small acquisitions of software peers and repurchase stock. On that latter note Synopsys has returned $717 million in excess cash to shareholders through the first nine months of fiscal 2022 in the form of share repurchases.

As of this writing Synopsys trades for 33.6 times enterprise value to free cash flow. Despite chip industry headwinds this software design and tech licensor is a great buy right now if you're looking for steady profitable growth from the semiconductor industry over the next decade."

But one of the unchanging constants through most of the time has been the economic base upon which the entire city has been built. That base has been farming. The business of this city traditionally has been serving the needs of farmers.

In the 10th decade however some rather remarkable changes took place. Worthington’s economic base began to broaden from the narrow pedestal of farming to the much broader one of agriculture. Where the main business was supplying farm and household needs of farmers it shifted perceptibly toward processing the produce of farmers. Where Worthington had been supplying labor for farmers it began to be a place where the sons and daughters of farmers found employment when squeezed off land by the technological revolution.

In the process the city cast off its traditional social make-up and became multi-racial and vastly more cosmopolitan in its social outlook. And the city was forced to strengthen its municipal skeleton at vast expense to meet the needs.

In the closing years of the 1950’s Campbell Soup Company bought from the Swanson Company what had been the old Worthmore creamery complex and went into heavy production of chicken and turkey soup components. Employment shot upward toward a thousand people. This followed by other major developments. In 1962 the city opened its northeast industrial tract. Fleetwood Homes was the first tenant. Factory built housing components were the product and many farm and non-farm homes began to roll out the wide doors by Christmas of that year.

On March 14 1963 Armor & Co. announced it would close its Sioux City Iowa plant a facility which employed 1100 persons with a payroll of $7 million. The reason given was the fact the plant could not be modernized economically.

ADVERTISEMENT

Among the workers transferred in were 39 blacks and several Native Americans and for the first time the city became truly multi-racial. That didn’t prove to be as much of a problem as did the matter of finding housing for new citizens. Worthington had filled every existing dwelling. Two families lived for much of that fall in the city park in tents. A housing bureau was set up and volunteer workers manned the phones. Some workers lived for weeks in hotels and motels but finally a place was found for everyone wanting one and Armour became an important corporate citizen. Mayor Joe Roos appointed the city’s first human relations council on Dec. 22 1965.

Satellite industries sprung up around Armour. The largest was Worthington Freezer Warehouse which was built in 1965. Late in the decade another major industrial development came.

Star Homes a division of Boise Cascade Corporation announced July 16 1969 that it would build a plant in Worthington to produce mobile homes. It became the second major industry in the decade to build here.

As a result of these activities Worthington’s employment shot upward. In fact it grew substantially faster than the population. In January 1960 the total number of job-holders was 3553. It went past the 4000 mark to 4035 in mid-1963 the first time in history it had done so. It went to 4372 in November 1964 and hit its all-time peak of 5077 on July 15 1968. It fell back in response to national trends but still stood at 4884 in the summer of 1970.

Most employees were engaged not in farming but in processing of agricultural production.

The city invested heavily in public facilities during the decade. It put $1.5 million into the new sewage plant and another $500000 into new lagoons. Sewage treatment is for a population of 100000.

It invested $1.4 million in 1963 to improve local water mains build additional storage capacity and to develop the south well field. Included was 10.25 miles of 20-inch pipeline which took 65 railroad carloads of pipe to build.

The city found it necessary in 1964 to invest heavily in school additions at West and at the high school. At the time the schools were 12 classrooms short.

The new county library was built in 1963 at a cost of $250000.

Late in the decade hospital improvements costing $2.8 million were planned including a 40-bed convalescent and rehabilitation wing.

Worthington was quite a different town in 1970 than it was in 1960. It had 20% more people at work. They were doing in many cases work that wasn’t even thought of 10 years previously. The companies for which they worked were pouring dollars into the economy. Campbell’s announced at the end of 1967 that it had spent $9 million for wages supplies and services that year in the local area. Armour said it paid out $43.35 million to area farmers for livestock in the year ending October 1969. It paid out $300000 on one single day of October that year.

Hog production shot upward. From 1964 to 1969 it was reliably estimated production went up 20% in the area and prices were holding 50 to 75 cents above the regular market.

And the city looked different even though cynics said it smelled the same. The aromatic old sewer plant across the street from the high school was gone. In its place was the facility near the airport and the aromatic lagoons to the northeast. A single quarter in Section 18 of Lorain Township which had grown corn in 1960 had sprouted millions of dollars worth of industries by 1970.

ooking for evidence of a strongly rebounding state economy? Consider this: in 2021 Illinois recorded 480 corporate facility expansion projects good for third in the country behind only Texas and Ohio.

Large investments from Amazon Cardinal Health Unis Company and Expeditors led the way. The world’s largest e-commerce company Amazon added a 1.16 million-sq.-ft. warehouse in Huntley and a 700000-sq.-ft. facility in DeKalb. Cardinal took up 635000 sq. ft. in Decatur Unis added 574000 sq. ft in Bolingbrook and Expeditors grew by 424000 sq. ft. in Joliet.

At the helm of this expansion wave is Sylvia Garcia director of the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity. She leads a team of 12 core bureaus and various administrative offices focused on modernizing the state’s workforce and supporting the growth of businesses large and small.

Coming out of a deep recession induced by the global COVID-19 pandemic Illinois faced a challenging time in 2021 as several major industries needed to revamp and rebuild. Illinois government stepped up to the plate by facilitating the start of 200000 businesses a new state record. “We are seeing a lot of positives” says Garcia. “We have the lowest unemployment number since the start of the pandemic.”

On July 21 the Illinois Department of Employment Security (IDES) released a report showing that the state unemployment rate dropped to 4.5% the lowest rate recorded in Illinois since March 2020. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 18800 in June IDES noted.

“With the statewide unemployment rate at its lowest since the onset of the pandemic the data released today is a further reflection of continued economic recovery and evidence of a strengthening Illinois labor market” said Deputy Governor Andy Manar. “As continued claims volumes reach record lows the Pritzker Administration and IDES working with local partners are committed to providing employment and training resources to ensure a competitive labor force while assisting employers in finding versatile workers.”

Garcia noted that “Illinois had made tremendous strides in the labor market adding nearly 250000 jobs over the past year and reaching the lowest unemployment rate since the onset of the pandemic. Illinois remains laser-focused on supporting the state’s positive gains by expanding workforce training opportunities attracting job creators and making resources available for priority industries such as tourism and hospitality and small businesses.”

Among the fastest-growing employment sectors in Illinois this year are leisure and hospitality manufacturing construction and educational and health services.

We recently caught up with Garcia who elaborated on the economic recovery taking place in the Land of Lincoln.

Which industries are growing at the fastest rate in Illinois right now and why?

SYLVIA GARCIA: We have a diversified economy. We are seeing growth in the food and beverage industry; transportation and logistics; technology and other key sectors. We are particularly seeing a lot of growth in emerging industry sectors such as fintech and quantum. A lot of this has to do with the environment that we are creating in Illinois — one that fosters innovation and entrepreneurship. With Rivian and other electric vehicle makers located here Illinois is rapidly becoming the North American hub of the EV revolution.

Tell me about the Reimagining Electric Vehicles (REV) incentive program.

SYLVIA GARCIA: We are really excited about REV Illinois. Legislation was passed last fall and signed into law in November 2021. Illinois was the first state to sign a specific program into law to benefit EV manufacturers and create the whole EV supply chain. We are offering competitive incentives to companies. The goal is to have 1 million EVs on the road by 2030. We want these vehicles to be made here in Illinois. We are currently the fourth largest vehicle manufacturing state. We are focused on the training components of that too.

Economic Development for a Growing Economy Tax Credit (EDGE) has been around for a while now. How would you evaluate the achievements of that program?

SYLVIA GARCIA: EDGE is an important incentive that has let us compete with other states. The question is how can we build on that? We are continually evaluating what works and what does not work. One change we recently made is the creation of the EDGE for startups program which will start this year. We also rolled out our Prime Site capital grant program in the last year which provides support to companies as they invest and grow in Illinois.

Workforce development and community investment have long been two hallmarks of DCEO. What accomplishments are you most proud of in these two areas?

SYLVIA GARCIA:Talent is one of our biggest selling features. We have done a lot of things in the last year in this area. The top three are $20 million focused on a job training program for those in the hardest hit communities; the $10 million Illinois Works pre-apprenticeship program; and $15 million for two manufacturing training academies. On community investment we have our $45 billion capital program called Rebuild Illinois which has supported a number of community investments including our shovel ready sites program.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3VzL2JsYWNrLWNhbGlmb3JuaWFucy1kZXRhaWwtcmFjaXNtLWFsbGVnZWRseS1mYWNlZC1sYXRpbm8tY28td29ya2Vycy1tYXNzaXZlLXJhY2UtYmlhcy1zdWl0c9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3VzL2JsYWNrLWNhbGlmb3JuaWFucy1kZXRhaWwtcmFjaXNtLWFsbGVnZWRseS1mYWNlZC1sYXRpbm8tY28td29ya2Vycy1tYXNzaXZlLXJhY2UtYmlhcy1zdWl0cy5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Black Californians detail racism they allegedly faced from Latino co-workers following massive race bias suits,"Black Californians are detailing racism they claim to have experienced at warehouses from Latino co-workers after companies in the state settled lawsuits with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

""We are seeing an increase in larger race harassment cases"" Anna Park regional attorney for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s Los Angeles district office told the Los Angeles Times. ""The nature of them has gotten uglier. There’s a more blatant display of hatred with the N-word with imagery with nooses. All the violence you’re seeing in the news it is manifesting in the employment context.""

Cardinal Health a medical supplier and Ryder Integrated Logistics a transport company subsidiary settled the EEOC lawsuits last year after accusations that supervisors ignored harassment claims at the warehouses located in California’s Inland Empire area. The Los Angles Times spoke to a handful of the Black employees who detailed the racist names and discrimination they allegedly faced from Latino co-workers and others.

""‘Hey monkey! Yeah you!’ and waved a banana in her hand. A group of women burst out laughing"" Benjamin Watkins told the LA Times of what a Latina co-worker said to him at a Moreno Valley warehouse.

SESAME PLACE CONTROVERSY: BLACK FAMILY FILES $25M RACIAL DISCRIMINATION LAWSUIT AFTER VIRAL CHARACTER SNUB

""When they look you right in the eye and call you the N-word to your face that’s dehumanizing"" a Black Ontario warehouse employee Leon Simmons told the outlet referencing the racial slurs he witnessed his Latino co-workers using.

The accusations also included claims that Black employees were often given more labor-intensive jobs compared to other employees were denied promotions and faced retaliation from both Latino and White supervisors if they complained about harassment and racism according to the court filings reviewed by the LA Times.

About 300 Black workers are set to receive compensation stemming from the settlements which also include payments from a staffing service company that helped supply workers to Ryder. The cases mark the largest race bias suits brought forward by the federal government in California over the last 10 years according to the Los Angeles Times.

Cardinal agreed to pay $1.45 million and Ryder agreed to pay $1 million. Ryder’s staffing service Kimco also agreed to pay $1 million to the Black workers. AppleOne a staffing service used by Cardinal agreed to hold harassment trainings in both English and Spanish and monitor any racism and abuse.

Data reported by the LA Times shows that the EEOC has won 171 race discrimination settlements involving Black employees over the last 10 years 59 cases involving Latino workers and 12 involving Asian workers. The agency has won six settlements involving White employees.

The outlet also found that a third of the cases brought forward by EEOC offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles over the last decade involved Latino discrimination against Black co-workers while White discrimination against Black co-workers made up another third of the cases at the offices.

""Two decades ago discrimination was viewed as a Black-white paradigm"" Park told the LA Times. ""The feeling was minorities can’t be discriminating. But it could be Asians discriminating it could be Latinos discriminating. Regardless of what color you are you don’t get a free pass.""

Other workers described how Black employees ""started disappearing one by one"" after they complained about discrimination how they reportedly did not receive a pay bump if they were moved to a job with higher-paying wages and how they repeatedly found racist graffiti in warehouse bathrooms.

Cardinal acknowledged ""derogatory graffiti"" and said it was promptly removed according to a court filing. Cardinal Health told Fox News Digital that it does not have ""anything to add beyond the facts about the settlement provided in the EEOC press release"" following last year’s settlement. A representative directed Fox to statements from the EEOC commending the company and AppleOne for ""establishing changes within their workplaces that will have a positive impact on their employees and the communities they reside in.""

AppleOne did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.

A recent investigation at Ryder found that both its employees and Kimco staffers had used racist language against Black employees and that managers failed to report the incidents. The companies however have denied widespread harassment accusations the LA Times reported.

A Ryder representative told Fox News Digital on Tuesday that the matter was settled more than a year ago and sent Ryder System Inc.'s statement on the matter from 2021.

""The claims in this particular case arose out of unfortunate events between employees of a former staffing vendor. While Ryder management was not involved and we were not aware of complaints related to the events while the individual was employed by the staffing vendor we are taking responsibility because the alleged conduct occurred on our premises"" the statement said.

""Ryder has long been committed to principles of diversity and inclusiveness and looks forward to partnering with the EEOC to continue those efforts"" the statement added.

According to a Lexington Police Department statement Eyvette Renee Hunter 52 was indicted and arrested Tuesday for distributing lorazepam (Ativan) on April 30 to James Morris age 97 against orders from a nurse practitioner and physician at Baptist Health. Hunter ""performed actions of medical maltreatment"" to Morris and he died on May 5 ""as a direct result of those actions"" according to the statement.

The hospital fired her the same day of the incident and ""Baptist Health Lexington has been cooperative and aided in the investigation"" according to the police.

Hunter's nursing license was suspended indefinitely on August 22 after the Kentucky Board of Nursing looked into a complaint from the hospital. According to the suspension order Morris had been admitted for a slip and fall injury.

""The report nurse informed Respondent [Hunter] that the patient had been restless and spent most of the previous night in the hallway sitting in a recliner"" according to the suspension order. Hunter alleged that she assisted the patient to his chair but he became ""became agitated and aggressive so she went to get restraints.""

After her request to medicate Morris was denied Hunger obtained 2 mg of lorazepam that was intended for another patient the suspension order states. When Morris tried to get up and set off a chair alarm Hunter came back in with other staff and gave the patient an injection. After Morris was sedated Hunter was asked what she had given him and she replied ""something special"" per the suspension order.

Another nurse found Morris struggling to breathe and his oxygen monitor disconnected; Hunter ""had disarmed/lowered the oxygen monitoring system several times as to not set off an alarm at the bedside"" according to the suspension order. The patient had low blood oxygen and after a respiratory therapist gave him breathing treatment and suctioned him they found ""a grayish/black substance that was thought to be food and/or medication."" This indicated he had breathed food or medication into the lungs according to the suspension order.

Morris was given medication to reverse the effects of the lorazepam and was responsive but ultimately succumbed to ""aspirational pneumonia"" according to the suspension order. Hunter's statement and written response to the Board confirmed she had given Morris the medication without an order and fed him afterward. She also changed documentation for the patient for whom the medication was intended to state ""not given"" per the suspension order.

Morris' obituary stated that he was a retired federal government employee and a World War II veteran as well as a Korean War vet.

Hunter's LinkedIn profile indicates she was a graduate of Washington Adventist University in Takoma Park Maryland and had previously worked as a hospice nurse and as a nurse at Cardinal Hill Rehabilitation Hospital in Lexington.

North America dominates the colorectal procedure market. North America is the dominating region in the colorectal procedure market. The growth can be attributed to age-related problems increasing government funds and continuous regional technology improvements. The growth of colorectal procedure market in the region is expected to grow significantly due to rising incidences of colorectal cancer across the country and growing government support for research in colon cancer. Moreover the government provides multiple programs for the betterment of the population.

On the other hand the US holds the largest market share in the region. Colorectal cancer is among the five most common cancers diagnosed in the US. The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be approximately 106000 new cases of colorectal cancer and nearly 45000 new cases of rectal cancer nationwide in 2022. More than 600000 surgeries are performed annually in the US to treat colon diseases. According to the American Cancer Society the 5-year survival rate for localized colon cancer is 91% and for localized rectal cancer is 90%. Overall colorectal cancer mortality rates have tended to decline with better screening and treatment over the past 20 years. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention adults aged 45 to 54 experienced a small but significant increase in colorectal cancer death rates. In 2021 the recommended minimum age for routine colorectal cancer screening was lowered from 50 to 45 years. Such factors mentioned above are responsible for the high adoption of colorectal procedures in the US.

Increasing Prevalence Of Colorectal Cancer Positively Influences Overall Market Growth:

Colorectal cancer is one of the most commonly found and lethal cancers developed in individuals with the combined influence of genetic and environmental factors. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) colorectal cancer is the third most prevalent form of cancer with ~1.93 million global cases in 2020. Furthermore colorectal cancer mortality and incidence rates vary globally and ~916000 deaths in 2020 were due to colorectal cancer. It is the third most common cancer in men and the second most common cancer in women. The lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer is about 1 in 23 for men and 1 in 25 for women. About 9555027 cancer deaths were recorded in 2018 of which 880792 were related to colorectal cancer. Therefore colorectal cancer was identified as the third most common cancer and the second most death-causing cancer. Colorectal cancer is increasingly affecting the populations in Asian countries. For instance according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer & GLOBOCAN the estimated incidence of colorectal cancer in Asia reported ~1009400 new cases in 2020. Japan China Malaysia Singapore Korea and Turkey are witnessing high prevalence rates compared to the other countries in Asia Pacific.

These statistics showcase increased demand for advanced cancer diagnostics and therapeutics in various regions. Thus the rising number of patients suffering from the disease is driving the growth of the global colorectal procedure market.

Ever since the outbreak the COVID-19 pandemic challenged healthcare systems globally. According to the Japan Society of Coloproctology report in October 2021 the total number of COVID-19 cases exceeded 240000000 and the total number of deaths was close to 5000000. Such high prevalence has several restrictions on the medical systems owing to shifts in medical care with the drastic drop in surgical and endoscopic treatments for colorectal cancer. For example the number of laparoscopic colorectal surgical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak severely dropped due to concerns regarding possible virus transmission during laparoscopic surgery. For instance the Istanbul University Yayinevi report states that the surgery of a 73-year-old man diagnosed with a partially obstructing middle rectal mass had been postponed for two weeks owing to the pandemic until he was admitted suffering from an ileus in April 2020. Therefore in the future colorectal surgery services seek significant new planning and arrangements for the preoperative preparation postoperative surgical care and delivery of complicated wound and stoma care.

Six Cuban migrants adrift at sea on a makeshift raft were rescued by a cruise ship last week video shared with CNN shows.

The video captured the impromptu encounter Friday as the Carnival Cruise liner Carnival Paradise sailed from Tampa Florida to Cozumel Mexico.

The clip shows passengers clapping and cheering as the migrants neared the ship.

“They didn’t have paddles” said passenger Cintia Zingoni who filmed the video. “It wasn’t really a boat. It was a piece of furniture maybe a cabinet and they made it as a boat.”

Zingoni a real estate agent from Orlando Florida was on the ship with her family and friends when they witnessed the event.

Her video shows what appears to be a small piece of fabric the migrants were using as a sail and styrofoam attached to the sides of their vessel for flotation. Zingoni said it also appeared the migrants were using a pot lid to paddle.

The migrants were welcomed on board the ship where they received a medical check-up food and clothes according to Carnival Cruise Lines spokesman Matt Lupoli. When the boat reached Cozumel they were turned over to Mexican officials he said.

According to Zingoni the ship’s captain announced to passengers that the migrants were dehydrated but otherwise fine.

“I felt sad. Everyone on the boat was dancing and having fun and they were dying” Zingoni said. “That was almost a suicide mission to go inside that piece of wood.”

Fellow passenger Lee Smith said the weather that evening took a turn for the worse.

“As we headed toward Mexico we were going fast to make up for lost time but there was a thunderstorm and lightning behind us in the area where we had left” he said. “Good thing we picked up the people in the raft.”

The dramatic rescue comes as US officials report a spike in Cubans trying to leave the communist-run island where ruling officials blame US sanctions for a cratering economy.

Cubans who reach the United States and ask for asylum are typically able to gain permanent residency under a special status granted by the 1962 Cuban Adjustment Act. Cubans picked up at sea by the US Coast Guard are usually returned to the island.

As Cuba deals with growing power outages and food shortages a record number of Cubans have left the island either by crossing into the US from the southern border with Mexico or by taking to the seas in small boats and rafts that US officials say are often pushed off course by ocean currents.

According to US Customs and Border Protection more than 175000 Cubans have arrived in the US from Mexico since July last year. In the same period more than 4500 Cubans intercepted at sea have been returned to Cuba the Coast Guard said in a statement Tuesday.

It’s not unusual for cruise ships to assist in maritime rescues. On June 4 Carnival Cruise ship Mardi Gras rescued 16 stranded Cubans about 60 nautical miles from Key West Florida.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vY3J1aXNlLmJsb2cvMjAyMi8wOC8xMi10aGluZ3Mtc3VycHJpc2VkLW1lLWFib3V0LWdvaW5nLW15LWZpcnN0LWNhcm5pdmFsLWNydWlzZS1kZWNhZGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,12 things that surprised me about going on my first Carnival cruise in a decade,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='cruise.blog', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2022/08/12-things-surprised-me-about-going-my-first-carnival-cruise-decade (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159BAB93820>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11004] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vY3J1aXNlLmJsb2cvMjAyMi8wOC8xMi10aGluZ3Mtc3VycHJpc2VkLW1lLWFib3V0LWdvaW5nLW15LWZpcnN0LWNhcm5pdmFsLWNydWlzZS1kZWNhZGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2Nhcm5pdmFsLWx1bWlub3NhLW9wZW5zLWZvci1zYWxlLWFzLXRoZS1uZXdlc3QtZnVuLXNoaXAtcHJlcGFyZXMtdG8tam9pbi10aGUtY2Fybml2YWwtY3J1aXNlLWxpbmUtZmxlZXQtMzAxNjExODU2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CARNIVAL LUMINOSA OPENS FOR SALE AS THE NEWEST FUN SHIP PREPARES TO JOIN THE CARNIVAL ...,"Now Accepting Reservations for Australia and Alaska Sailings from Nov. 6 2022 through April 2024

Memories of my annual treks for the past eight years to islands including Trinidad Barbados Anguilla Antigua and the Cayman Islands colored my mind with the sweetest reminders of what freedom looks and feels like.

The history of Carnival is deeply tied to this same sentiment—when enslaved Africans banned from participating in the masquerade and Lent celebrations of plantation owners created their own rituals of song dress and dance as a means of autonomy against their oppressors. The burning of sugarcane the splashing of paint and powder on the body the ringing of steel pans and cowbells—these symbols of revelry and defiance are still used in Carnival celebrations today. Experiencing it firsthand is addictive and so I didn’t hesitate to plan my return—this time to Grenada’s celebration called Spice Mas . This was my second time joining the bacchanal on the eastern Caribbean island often referred to as Spice Isle because of its mass production of nutmeg and other spices.

Resting before the back-to-back Carnival parties (called fetes) is key so I checked into the ultra sleek Silversands Grenada for a proper respite. The luxury resort sits on one of the island’s most prized white-sand beaches Grand Anse but it’s the nearly 350-foot pool framing the lobby entrance and spilling into the distant ocean that’s the star of the show. Thirty-nine rooms four suites and nine pool residences line the property and two restaurants—Grenadian Grill and Asiatique—serve Caribbean and Asian cuisine respectively. Knowing that my body would soon experience very little sleep I enjoyed a massage at Silversands quiet oasis of a spa and lounged in a shaded cabana by the pool as often as possible.

And then the show began: fetes on boats and on land all fueled by soca music and rum; linked arms with strangers jumping in unison; bodies pressed against each other in dance; smiles both large and unwavering painted on thousands of faces; a quick nap before sunrise to do it all again gladly. If you do not believe adults can feel the joy of children book a ticket to a Caribbean carnival.

On my second day I woke up to participate in a Grenadian tradition both sacred and powerful in its roots: playing jab. Also known as j’ouvert the celebration calls people to gather before the sun rises to prepare for hours of dancing chanting and symbolic representations of the rebellion and defiance that enslaved Africans upheld. These symbols include wearing devil horns to mock colonizers covering the body in tar-colored paint as a celebration of Blackness and even dragging broken chains to signify a breaking from slavery. By the time the sun was out my entire body alongside hundreds of others was covered in black paint and oil.

On Tuesday bright regalia lined the streets of the island for the final parade. This year I played “mas” (short for masquerade) with a band (group) called Oro . Costumes bedazzled in black sequins and feathers reminiscent of Maleficent glowing hues of yellow and the shimmering pink of my own costume’s crown were all on full display. We spent hours on the road connected by the sounds of soca and our longing to return to these same streets. At night trucks still blaring music and serving rum into plastic cups parked curbside and the energy was palpable.

Grenada’s carnival is small but mighty in comparison to other larger islands’ celebrations and though I selfishly hope it remains that way it likely won’t. Around the world the hype and images of Carnival continue to grow giving a glimpse into the electric colors movement and traditions that many Caribbean islands have been celebrating for centuries. Trinidad’s bacchanalia is often considered the greatest example of the celebration drawing thousands of people from as far as Japan to its shores each year but just northwest there’s a magic happening in its own right in Grenada untouched by commercialization and deeply tied to specific traditions like jab.

I don’t just plan to return solely for Carnival again next year because Grenada is a place I’ve considered calling home one day. My first visit to the island six years ago included a stay at Spice Island Beach Resort —the only Black-owned five-star luxury resort in the Caribbean. That introduction to the island included impeccable hospitality and an ease that drew me to Grenadian culture. Dishes of grilled kingfish curry-filled roti and a dangerously strong rum punch remain some of the best meals I’ve had at a hotel. The sunsets from Spice Island’s prime location on Grand Anse beach are also unlike anywhere else I’ve seen in the world. It’s hard to capture the turquoise ocean swallowing a fiery orange sun in a fuschia sky with my camera phone as many times as I’ve tried.

In the town of St. George pastel-colored homes mounted on hillsides glow onto the yacht-dotted ocean below. My favorite farewell to the island is at BB’s Crabback a family-owned restaurant overlooking St. George’s Harbour that serves fresh catches of the day like mahi mahi curried goat and the dish that I dream of often: crabback. Fresh crab meat melds with herbs wine and cheese then is stuffed into a crab shell and served alongside warm bake (deep-fried dough). This last supper was just as special as the first time I had it years ago as was the entire experience on beautiful Spice Isle.
