According to Huntington Ingalls Industries the ship’s sponsors are the six women of the historic group known as the Little Rock Nine the first African American students to attend all-white Central High School in Little Rock Ark. during desegregation. The Little Rock Nine are Thelma Mothershed Minnijean Brown Elizabeth Eckford Gloria Ray Jefferson Thomas Melba Beals Terrence Roberts Carlotta Walls and Ernest Green.

The Little Rock Nine made history in 1957 with their response to the Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education declaring racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional. Faced with shouting mobs threats of violence and hostile state leaders who blocked their way the teenagers were escorted into the school by federal troops at the direction of President Dwight Eisenhower.

“Their courageous spirit will forever inspire Arkansas and her crew. This group forever changed our nation’s history and their submarine will help ensure their legacy continues” Newport News Shipbuilding (NNS) President Jennifer Boykin said in a statement. “The bravery and resilience of the Little Rock Nine sparked a fire of change and demonstrated the strength of blending different perspectives and backgrounds.”

During Saturday’s ceremony NNS welders etched a historic six sets of initials of the Little Rock Nine onto metal plates signifying the keel of SSN 800 as being “truly and fairly laid.” The metal plates will remain affixed to the submarine throughout its life.

“(Former Navy) Secretary Ray Mabus asked us to be supporters of the ship and its crew. I signed on to be a foster grandmother” said Eckford a member of the Little Rock Nine who spoke on behalf of the group during the ceremony. “President Eisenhower sent 1000 paratroopers to Little Rock to disperse a mob bring order and they made it possible for us to enter Central High School. From that point I’ve had very high regard for specially trained forces.”

Arkansas is the 27th Virginia-class fast attack submarine being built under the teaming agreement with General Dynamics Electric Boat. The submarine is expected to be delivered to the U.S. Navy in 2025. The cost per submarine in the Virginia class ranges between $2.8 billion and $3.45 billion according to U.S. Navy and Congressional Research Service estimates.

NNS is one of only two shipyards capable of designing and building nuclear-powered submarines. The advanced capabilities of Virginia-class submarines increase firepower maneuverability and stealth.

“With advances in sound silencing acoustic sensors and weapons delivery systems Arkansas will traverse the world’s oceans and seas as an apex predator. Representing our asymmetric advantage in the undersea domain the Arkansas will have no equal” said Vice Adm. William Houston commander Naval Submarine Forces.

According to the Navy the first Arkansas ship was a steamer originally named the Tonawanda that was active during the U.S. Civil War. The second Arkansas vessel was commissioned in 1902 and was a monitor with a single gun turret. It was one of the last monitors of the Navy. The third was one of two Wyoming-class battleships commissioned in 1912. The last Arkansas was one of four Virginia-class nuclear-powered guided missile cruisers. It was commissioned in 1980 and decommissioned in 1998.",,,,,,,,,,,,

[Eivind]’s TinyLlama lets you play DOS games on a board that fits in your hand.

Using the 486 SOM from the 86Duino the TinyLlama adds an integrated Crystal Semiconductor audio chip for AdLib and SoundBlaster support. If you populate the 40 PIN Raspberry Pi connector you can also use a Pi Zero 2 to give the system MIDI capabilities when coupled with a GY-PCM5102 I²S DAC module.

Audio has been one of the trickier things to get running on these small 486s so its nice to see a simple integrated solution available. [Eivind] shows the machine running DOOM (in the video below the break) and starts up Monkey Island at the end. There is a breakout board for serial and PS/2 mouse/keyboard but he says that USB peripherals work well if you don’t want to drag your Model M out of the closet.

The core goal of the project is to optimize resource utilization: storage runtime memory and link-time costs. This is accomplished by not depending on any external libraries and utilizes features provided by the Linux Kernel to the maximum extent possible. The result is a self-contained environment that only depends on the Linux Kernel and the runtime C library.""

One of countless great open-source projects from Intel over the years is IWD as a modern wireless daemon for WiFi devices on Linux. IWD has been in the works for over a half-decade as a new replacement to wpa_supplicant and with time has implemented many features and seen widespread adoption. Released this week was IWD 2.0 as the latest milestone for this open-source wireless daemon.For those not familiar with IWD from past Phoronix articles or experimenting with it yourself the project Wiki sums itself up as: NetworkManager supports IWD as does Intel's ConnMan connection manager. With the recent Ubuntu 22.10 release IWD finally was promoted to main



Intel has done a lot for Linux wireless over the years from WiFi drivers and utilities like IWD and ConnMan to the now dropped WiMAX code to improving Linux networking support/performance in general.

Minichelli Obituary,"Richard J. Minichelli age 90 of Erie died on Wednesday November 16 2022. He was born in Erie on May 3 1932 the son of the late Emidio and Lucia (Pallotto) Minichelli. Richie lived a humble life and was a great man.

Richard graduated from Tech Memorial High School as a printer with Honors and also medaled in Math. He entered the work force at a very early age to help support his family. Richard had a very strong work ethic throughout his career. He was employed and retired as a foreman at the Firch Baking Company and then later worked at the Hammermill and International Paper Companies from which he also retired. He was also a proud Korean War Veteran; serving four years as a radio mechanic in the U.S. Air Force before being honorably discharged.

As a young man Richard loved to bowl play softball and had a passion for playing a challenging game of cards; where he had an ability to easily memorize the deck and know exactly what all the other players were holding in their hands. He was an avid horse racing fan. Over the years “going to the track” with his eye on the prize always became the hot topic of conversation. Richard was a lifelong member of Saint Paul Church.

Richard was preceded in death by his parents his eldest brother; Egidio Minichelli and his niece Jane Marie Minichelli.

He is survived by his two brothers Robert A. Minichelli (Lillian) and Frank D. Minchelli (Constance) four nieces and a nephew; Karen DiMichele (Vincent) Patty Bensur (Dan) Judy Minichelli and Dr. Mark R. Minichelli (Julie). He is further survived by four great-nieces and two great-nephews. To Karen Jane and Mark he was extra special because not only was he their Uncle Rich but also the Godfather to all three.

Nothing was more important to Richard than his family. He was a loyal caring and generous person not only to his family but also to his friends and even strangers. He will be greatly missed by all those who knew him.

Friends are invited to attend a Funeral Mass on Saturday November 26th at Saint Paul Church 1617 Walnut Street at 11:00 a.m. Entombment will follow at Calvary Cemetery. In lieu of flowers memorial contributions can be made to the Second Harvest Food Bank 1507 Grimm Dr. Erie PA 16501.

He received many honours including being named a fellow of the Econometric Society a distinguished fellow of the American Economic Association and a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Ronald Winthrop Jones was born in Louisville Kentucky in 1931. He received a BA from Swarthmore College in 1952 and a PhD from MIT in 1956. After spending a year as an instructor at Swarthmore he received an offer to join the faculty at the University of Rochester. Lionel McKenzie had been hired to build a PhD programme in economics and his philosophy was to hire faculty in applied fields with an interest in theory. That approach combined with the opportunity to teach a graduate course in international trade led Jones to choose Rochester over Princeton (Jones 2012). He served a brief stint in the army before joining the faculty at Rochester in 1958. Ron was one of McKenzie’s first hires and played a key role in building the department into one of the profession’s top programmes.

Starting with his PhD thesis Jones made seminal contributions to the central competitive models of international trade: the Ricardian model the Heckscher-Ohlin model and the specific factor model. For example the concept of comparative advantage in a two-good two-country Ricardian model is well known to undergraduate students but how does that concept extend to a world with many commodities and many countries?

It was known that allocating production on the basis of bilateral comparisons could lead to inefficient outcomes but a general rule had not been derived. Ron’s 1961 paper in the Review of Economic Studies answered that question by showing that characterising the pattern of efficient specialisations in a many-country many-commodity world involved minimising the product of the unit labour requirements. He also derived the range of inefficient allocations that could arise in the presence of tariffs.

Ron’s 1965 paper in the Journal of Political Economy laid out an elegant approach to two-sector two-factor (2x2) models using what would later become known as the ‘hat calculus’ (Jones 1965). He showed how this approach provided a simple way to derive the Stolper-Samuelson and Rybczynski theorems of the Heckscher-Ohlin model as well as providing insights on economic growth and technological change. He subsequently extended this framework to provide insights on trade models with factor market distortions and Marshallian external economies of scale.

One of the special (and striking) features of the 2x2 model of trade is that it generates what Jones termed a ‘magnification effect’: a change in an exogenous variable (price or factor endowment) has a more than proportional impact on one endogenous variable (factor income or output) and a decline in the other. In the 2x2 model the identity of the gainer from the magnification effect is the factor intensity of the sector: a price increase in the labour-intensive good benefits labour and harms capital.

A literature subsequently developed to identify the extent to which this magnification effect would generalise to higher dimension models. How does one think about relative factor intensities of sectors in a many-factor many-good world? Under what conditions will the increase in the price of a good benefit one factor while harming all others?

In generalising the 2x2 model Jones emphasised the difference between even (nxn) and uneven (mxn) cases. He generated insight into this issue by examining a simple three-factor two-good model where one of the factors was mobile between sectors and the other two (sector-specific) factors were trapped in their respective sectors.

His 1973 paper (Jones 1973) showed the differential impact of changes in market conditions on mobile factors and specific factors. The magnification effect of price changes on factor incomes applied to the specific factors but not the mobile factors. Similarly changes in endowments of the specific factors resulted in magnified effects on outputs whereas changes in the endowment of the mobile factor did not.

The specific factor model has been particularly useful in the literature on the political economy of trade policy since the fact that the incomes of specific factors are tied to the price of a particular good gives them an interest in organising in order to influence trade policy regarding that good. It also can be interpreted as a short-run version of the Heckscher-Ohlin model in which labour is mobile in the short run while sector-specific capital only becomes mobile between sectors in the long run.

In subsequent work with Jose Scheinkman (Jones and Scheinkman 1977) Ron examined what can be said about magnification effects in a general m-factor and n-good model. They showed that in the absence of joint production a good must be a ‘natural friend’ of some factor in the economy in the sense that raising its price will raise the factor’s return more than proportionally. A good will also be a natural enemy of some factor. But a particular factor does not necessarily have a friend or enemy.

Jones’ work frequently used low dimensional model of international trade to provide insights about the general equilibrium impact of changes in prices technologies and factor supplies. But as the above examples illustrate he was also interested in identifying what elements of the low dimensional models generalised to higher dimensions.

Ron was one of the first to focus on the expanding role of global supply chains a process he referred to as ‘fragmentation’. In a series of papers with Henryk Kierzkowski beginning in 1990 he emphasised the role of local service links in making it possible for pieces of the production process to be offshored. Jones’ book Globalization and the Theory of Input Trade showed how traditional models of international trade could be expanded to capture the movement of factors of production and the expansion of input trade.

In addition to being a prolific scholar Jones was a great teacher and expositor. His presentations were clear and insightful and he always had an elegant way to express an idea. As a result his graduate international trade class at Rochester was extremely popular and students were eager to work with him and to seek his advice.

Alan Deardorff’s family tree of trade economists lists 29 students and 119 ‘grandstudents’ of Jones. He was also generous with his time with younger faculty in the profession. His talents also extended to the writing and production of musicals to honour various members of the faculty at Rochester.

Ron was a great advocate for the field of international trade. His textbook World Trade and Payments (with Richard Caves and later Jeffrey Frankel) was one of the leading textbooks in the field and its popularity is reflected in the fact that it went through ten editions. Ron travelled extensively giving lectures on his work on international trade and one would not be surprised to run into him anywhere in the world.

The greater availability of data on international trade and production has led to the ability to quantify trade models with data and the general equilibrium modelling approach developed by Jones and others has provided building blocks for the development of the field.

Nasdaq 100 the index primarily comprising technology and communication stocks is down by nearly 28% YTD in 2022. As an Indian investor looking to diversify across foreign stocks some of the most popular stocks are Apple Amazon Tesla Microsoft Meta and Google amongst others. However other than the options available to take exposure in US stocks through an international trading platform the window to buy international mutual funds in India is almost shut.

There are several mutual fund houses in India that offer international mutual funds to Indian investors. The total amount of offshore investment in the mutual fund sector is limited to a maximum of US$7 billion in accordance with SEBI regulations. The maximum amount of overseas investments that any mutual fund house may have is $1 billion USD.

However to buy international stocks in dollars the combined limit of $7 billion was about to be breached by them. SEBI subsequently imposed a restriction on fund houses offering overseas funds from February 02 2022.

The total upper limit of US$7 billion for the sector as a whole includes a separate upper threshold of US$1 billion for mutual fund schemes investing in ETFs (listed overseas) and they are still open to investors. However the pricing of these ETFs may be a concern with restrictions in place.

The revision in the overseas investment limit may be the need of the hour. The US stock market provides ample opportunities to investors for diversifying and managing country risks. Currently two things are not going in favour of US stocks especially from the tech sector – one the high valuation that they enjoyed in the low-interest rate regime is no more there as rates are going up and secondly the changing economic environment is putting pressure on their core business activities.

SV Guide: How To Upgrade Pokemon Mounts & All Titan Pokemons,"When you have your mount Pokemon Koraidon or Miraidon you would want to have all five abilities to swiftly navigate your way to in the Paldea Region. The Path of Legends storyline gives you the opportunity to get all these five abilities but there is a test to get each one of them for your mount. The test consists of defeating Titan Pokemons in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet where you have to help Arven take them all down to finish the storyline.

There are a total of five Titan Pokemons in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet all holding the powerful Herba Mystica where each will give your mount Pokemon an ability. Each Herba Mystica is made into a sandwich which powers up Koraidon or Miraidon. Using these power-ups will acquire their mount skills giving them the ability to dash jump higher swim glide and scale up cliffs.



Here are all the Titan Pokémon in order of level based on Arven's Pokemon level joining you in the battle. You will receive their respective Herba Mystica corresponding ability that unlocks for your mount. Do not rely heavily on Arven's Pokemon as they will just be a meat shield for you to use since most of the time they faint from the battle.

TITAN POKEMON

– Stony Cliff Titan (Klawf)

– Open Sky Titan (Bombirdier)

– Lurking Steel Titan (Orthworm)

– The Quaking Earth Titan (Great Tusk/Iron Treads)

– The False Dragon Titan (Dondozo and Tatsugiri)

DASH – STONY CLIFF TITAN (KLAWF)

Klawf will meet you as a budget version of Kingler but with a derp face instead of a serious one like our King Crab. Klawf is also a rock-type Pokémon which can be easily beaten with Pokemon with move types such as Grass Ground Steel Water and Fighting. These will make the battle easier for you to clear quickly since the battle is pretty much straight forward with you just battling the Titan. Arven will bring out a level 16 Shellder for you to use as a distraction for Klawf.

Sweet Herba Mystica will give your Koraidon or Miraidon to learn how to dash.

MOVE ON WATER – OPEN SKY TITAN (BOMBIRDIER)

Now Bombirdier may look elegant and kind on the outside it packs a punch on each of its attacks. Bombirdier is a dark and flying type Pokémon which can be easily defeated with Pokemon with move types such as Electric Ice Fairy and Rock. These will also make the battle easier for you to clear quickly since the battle is pretty much straight forward with you just battling the Titan. Arven will bring out a level 19 Nacli for you to use as a support for Bombirdier.

Bitter Herba Mystica will be used for your Koraidon or Miraidon to learn how to swim or move on water

JUMP HIGHER – LURKING STEEL TITAN (ORTHWORM)

Another cute but strong Pokemon to fight is Orthworm. Orthworm is a steel type Pokémon which can be easily defeated with Pokemon with move types such as Fire and Fighting. Do take note that it will not take any damage from ground type attacks due to it having an “Earth Eater” abilitiy which absorbs ground type moves converting it to HP. Arven will also bring out a small level 28 Toedscool for you to use as a support for the battle against the giant cute worm.

Salty Herba Mystica will give your Koraidon or Miraidon to learn how to jump higher.



GLIDE – THE QUAKING EARTH TITAN (GREAT TUSK/IRON TREADS)

For this one the Titan Pokemon will depend on the version you are playing. If you are playing Pokemon Scarlet you will face the Great Tusk which is a Ground and Fighting type Pokemon. If you are playing Pokemon Violet you will face the Iron Treads which is a Ground and Steel type Pokemon. Both Pokemon are familiar as they look like separate evolutions of Donphan. You can easily defeat the Great Tusk with Psychic Flying Fairy Grass and Water moves while you would want to use Fire Fighting Ground and Water for the Iron Treads Pokemon. Arven will still assist you but now with a level 44 Scovillain for the fight.



Sour Herba Mystica will give your Koraidon or Miraidon to be able to glide from cliffs close to flying.



MOUNTAIN CLIMB – THE FALSE DRAGON TITAN (DONDOZO AND TATSUGIRI)

In this fight you will be facing 2 Pokemon to get the last Herba Mystica. The False Dragon Titan will show up first after interacting with a Tatsugiri Pokemon in the area shown on the map. The first Pokemon you will face is Dondozo who by the name is a false dragon. It is only a Water type Pokemon so Electric and Grass type moves will defeat it. Arven will also help you out with a level 55 Greedent with him. After the fight with Dondozo the true Titan will show himself the Tatsugiri. Tatsugiri is the dragon of the two which has Water and Dragon as its types. Dragon and Fairy move sets will help you take down this “huge” monster.

Spicy Herba Mystica will give your Koraidon or Miraidon to be able to scale up vertical cliffs with ease allowing you to fully explore Paldea finally.

These are all the Pokemon Titans you need to take down in order to get all the abilities of your mount Pokemon. There's a continuation to the storyline of The Path of Legendsbut that's up to you to find out after defeating all 5 Pokemon Titans. Now you have the ability to navigate and explore the entirety of Paldea Region with ease to find more Pokemon to catch or secret spots to see.

Contributed/Tom Stromme

GRAND FORKS – Last week the swan. This week the goose but a goose of a different kind the cackling goose.

In the great debate over bird species the splitters won this one. Cackling goose was considered a subspecies of the familiar Canada goose but genetics have shown that it is a separate – though very similar – species.

In the past this species then considered a subspecies of Canada goose was called Richardson’s goose or sometimes Hutchin’s goose. Its scientific name is Branta hutchinsii indicating its close relationship to the larger Canada goose tribe which encompasses several subspecies.

Cackling geese can be told from Canada geese though identification requires a close look. Here are the field marks that the Cornell University Laboratory of Ornithology provides on its website.

First it is a small stocky goose. Its legs are short meaning it appears lower to the ground. Likewise the bill is small and joins the forehead as a sharper angle than is the case with other similar geese. Its neck is short adding to the overall compact look of the bird. Finally and perhaps more or less definitively it lacks the white color that Canada geese display. Most cackling geese have only a hint of white where the neck meets the breast of the birds.

I’ve been pondering the cackling goose since I encountered a giant flock of them along the Red River Greenway. They were on the river I was looking down at them from a snow-covered trail. The geese were outrageously noisy. I heard them when I went out the front door of our house which is perhaps a quarter of a mile from the Greenway and perhaps a bit more.

READ MORE ABOUT BIRDWATCHING:





The noise of the geese lured me along. The flock was a nervous bunch of birds. Groups of two dozen or more kept rising with some returning and some apparently heading south.

Their calls are another hint at identification. Their calls are higher pitched than Canada geese. So I was pretty sure I was tracking cackling geese as soon as I left the house.

Unlike the Canada goose which has become re-established in the north central states the cackling goose is an Arctic nester. Its breeding range runs from the Bering Sea coast of Alaska across Arctic Canada to the southern tip of Baffin Island.

Cackling geese winter on the southern Great Plains from the Texas Panhandle to southern Nebraska and on the Gulf Coast of Texas and Louisiana. Smaller numbers winter on the Pacific Coast from the San Francisco Bay to Puget Sound as well as interior California and Nevada.

Of course the birds from the central part of the range pass through our area on their way south.

Cackling geese do flock with Canada geese so it’s possible to score a birding twofer by examining a flock of geese.

The emergence of the cackling goose as a separate species is relatively recent. Richard Crossley treats them separately in his “Crossley Guide” which was published in 2011. He adds a couple of other identification clues. One is that the breast is paler than Canada geese tending to be a little more gray than brown – but not always. Plus he points out that most cackling geese “look small and cute compared to Canada geese” but again “not always.”

He also warns that both Canada and cackling geese “show great variation in characters such as shape of white throat patch white ring at the base of the neck and paleness of underparts.” He adds that “these features are too variable to be of significant use in field ID.”

So there you have it – the swan last week the goose this week.

And next week the turkey.

Tinashe and Dove Cameron wore the same look on the 2022 American Music Awards red carpet on Sunday November 20.

Cameron 26 arrived at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles donning a sexy white corset top by Marc Jacobs. The Descendants star paired the cropped number with leather gloves and a balloon skirt made from deconstructed jackets. For her glam Cameron rocked dramatic winged liner glossy lips and black and white nails. She had her hair styled in a high ponytail with braided strands cascading down her face.

It was a big night for the ""If Only"" artist as she scored the Best New Artist of the Year Award beating out Gayle Latto Maneskin and Steve Lacy. ""This is so meaningful. I want to start by saying that every award that I ever win will always first and foremost be dedicated to the queer community at large"" she said on stage. ""I've never felt more loved and supported and I hope I can give you some semblance of that same feeling in my music.""

Tinashe 29 for her part teamed the skintight corset with a low-rise black skirt that covered her towering platform heels. Like Cameron the ""2 On"" songstress accessorized with black leather gloves. She kept the edgy theme going with square sunglasses by Marc Jacobs and wore her hair in sleek bantu knots.

The Kentucky native has been turning heads in the fashion department over the past few weeks.

For the 2022 GQ Men of the Year party in Los Angeles on Thursday November 17 Tinashe took a major style risk by opting to go braless under an unbuttoned blazer. She complemented the outerwear piece with high-waisted pants that featured gathered fabric. Two days earlier she attended the Mugler Couturissime Exhibition opening at the Brooklyn Museum in a shiny cutout top and an asymmetrical skirt. The garments showcased her killer abs. Tinashe finalized the look with pointed-toe pumps paired with knee-high socks.

The ""Player"" singer also slayed at the CFDA Fashion Awards on November 7 dazzling in a vintage Dior leather dress. Tinashe added even more pizazz with a layered choker necklace and wore her hair in French braids.

The hitmaker opened up about her style choices to Billboard in 2017 sharing: ""As I grew up I gained an appreciation for Aaliyah and most recently Solange. I would say that she's currently my biggest icon; she just embodies what it means to be a style icon by having a huge sense of identity and ability to take risks."""

You’ve talked a lot with him through these negotiations. Do you agree with that?

I don’t know if I’m in any position to diagnose his mental acuity. But look I will say it’s not personal but everyone ages differently. It’s physiology or what have you. Everybody’s different. My father-in-law is the same age as Joe Biden and he acts as though he’s 20 years younger. He’s vibrant he works long days he still runs his business that he’s been running for many years. He’s on his A-game.

To be candid I don’t believe President Biden is. And it concerns me deeply. I take no pleasure in saying that because I think it’s a dangerous thing for the country. I think that our adversaries see him in the same way that many Americans do. And I think that’s a very dangerous thing for us right now because that’s why our adversaries are acting so provocatively. I believe in Reagan’s principles. He reminded us that we maintain peace through strength. And if America doesn’t project strength it’s a great concern to free people around the world. And you see the results.

Bade: What gives you the impression that Biden has lost a step a little bit with age?

You know I don’t want to violate any personal confidences or anything but I’ve had private conversations with him of course. But you don’t need to rely upon my reflection of a private conversation. You can see him in public in his public statements. And it’s important.

Lizza: One more thing about President Biden. POLITICO reported in a very important investigation that billions of dollars from Biden’s four big 2021 and 2022 legislative packages remain unspent. Have you thought about clawing back that unspent money from those four bills and what you might spend it on?

Well the principle of clawing back unspent dollars is an easy yes. But of course the devil’s in the details. I’m not sure what categories those are what accounts they’re in what it was dedicated for. If we have the ability to claw it back we could certainly use that money.

Right now we’ve got $35.5 trillion in federal debt. And we’re working every day on restoring the principles of fiscal sanity here. One of the things we’re trying to do for example is break up the governance by omnibus. We got a first stab at it. We broke the last spending package into two minibuses. And now we’re going to actually endeavor to do 12 separate appropriations bills for fiscal year 2025.

Bade: How are you going to do that when a bunch of your members are sinking rules left and right? You weren’t able to do all 12 bills last time. What makes you think you can this year?

Well the reason I’m such an optimist about this is because I handle this situation and this challenge like every other. We’re going to set up listening sessions when we get back next week to have everybody come in. We’ll begin with the topline spending numbers build consensus on that.

We’re going to do something that’s also innovative: We’re going to start with an actual number that everybody can agree to on the front end not waste time negotiating that. Then the appropriators can begin their process methodically taking each of the bills working that through the committee process.

I met with Tom Cole who’s our Appropriations chair and he says “We can do that.” We can produce those bills by the end of the summer and get them ready for movement on the floor. We’d like to do that and get it through the House and send it over to the Senate and then dare Chuck Schumer not to do his job. I think that that would be fun for the House to jam the Senate for a change.

Bade: Tom Cole said that you were going to mark up the bills at the levels that have already been negotiated with Democrats not try to do this thing that McCarthy did where you cut like $100 billion or some such. Again you think conservatives are going to vote for appropriations bills at that level?

Well I can tell you I’ve talked to a number of House Freedom Caucus members Chip Roy and others and many of them have already said it’s the number that was already negotiated. I think it’s $1.606 or $1.621 trillion.

But there is a number that everyone has already agreed to. The thing that people rejected last time was the so-called “side deals” and “gimmicks” and all the other stuff on the outside.

Lizza: We want to ask you about some of your fellow leaders in Congress. Let’s start with Hakeem Jeffries the House Democratic leader. Like you he’s a religious man. Have you gotten to know Jeffries as a brother in Christ?

I have. Hakeem is a good man. We’ve worked well together. We have a lot more in common than people might think. You know he’s from New York and I’m from Louisiana. While we have lots of disagreements on policies and the fine points of policy I think you can appreciate people for who they are as a person. I think that’s what we’re called to do. And he and I both kind of share the worldview on that. I can appreciate that he’s a good family man. We have a lot in common in that regard. And he lost his father recently I lost mine three days before I got elected to Congress. We’ve talked about that.

We’ve talked about how he and I both came to our leadership positions in a rather circuitous fashion that neither of us predicted or expected in terms of timing and how we would be elevated as we were. He’s been here a little bit longer than I have been. But there are things that we have in common.

And I think what we’ve appreciated about one another is that I believe that when Hakeem Jeffries is telling me something I believe he’s telling me the truth. I believe he is a man of his word. And I think he believes that about me as well. That’s a big thing in Washington. You know trust is a rare commodity around here.

While we don’t agree on many things it’s really refreshing to sit across the table from someone who is your political adversary and know that they’re shooting straight. I wish that we could have a lot more of that around here because it would solve a lot of problems. Look I’m a Reagan Republican. I love the way he did the job. He was a happy warrior you know?

He was a hero to all of us. I think to all Republicans he’s still the standard-bearer. And the reason is because of the way he did the job. He’s very principled. But he didn’t hate anybody right?

Reagan and [Democratic Speaker] Tip O’Neill famously had this great relationship. And after his assassination attempt Tip O’Neill goes to the hospital and kisses him on the forehead. They didn’t agree on almost anything but they had respect for one another. And I think we’ve got to get back to that. I think America needs more of that.

The person on the other side of the aisle is not an enemy. They’re a fellow American. Our enemies are like Hamas and Hezbollah and the people who are trying to kill us. These are our political adversaries. The Founders anticipated that you have people with very different philosophical ideas very different principles and ideas about government but we would come here sit around a table and arm wrestle together and kind of get to a point of consensus so that we can govern the country. This system doesn’t work unless you understand the principles that undergird it. And I think restoring those principles is really important for this institution to endure.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L3Bob3RvLXBlZHJvLXBhc2NhbC1kYWtvdGEtam9obnNvbi0xNDUyMDAwMjguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Photo of Pedro Pascal and Dakota Johnson Kissing Passionately on the Street Has Gone Viral,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L3Bob3RvLXBlZHJvLXBhc2NhbC1kYWtvdGEtam9obnNvbi0xNDUyMDAwMjguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E60F681870>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L3Bob3RvLXBlZHJvLXBhc2NhbC1kYWtvdGEtam9obnNvbi0xNDUyMDAwMjguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndqaGwuY29tL25ld3MvY3JpbWUvdGJpLTMtY2hhcmdlZC13aXRoLW11cmRlci1pbi1qb2huc29uLWNpdHktb3ZlcmRvc2Uv0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2pobC5jb20vbmV3cy9jcmltZS90YmktMy1jaGFyZ2VkLXdpdGgtbXVyZGVyLWluLWpvaG5zb24tY2l0eS1vdmVyZG9zZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TBI: 3 charged with murder in Johnson City overdose,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.wjhl.com/news/crime/tbi-3-charged-with-murder-in-johnson-city-overdose/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndqaGwuY29tL25ld3MvY3JpbWUvdGJpLTMtY2hhcmdlZC13aXRoLW11cmRlci1pbi1qb2huc29uLWNpdHktb3ZlcmRvc2Uv0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2pobC5jb20vbmV3cy9jcmltZS90YmktMy1jaGFyZ2VkLXdpdGgtbXVyZGVyLWluLWpvaG5zb24tY2l0eS1vdmVyZG9zZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL21hcmtldHMvY29tbW9kaXRpZXMvcGxhdGludW0tc2V0LWJpZ2dlc3QtZGVmaWNpdC1kZWNhZGUtMjAyNC1zYXlzLWpvaG5zb24tbWF0dGhleS0yMDI0LTA1LTA4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Platinum set for biggest deficit in a decade in 2024 says Johnson Matthey,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL21hcmtldHMvY29tbW9kaXRpZXMvcGxhdGludW0tc2V0LWJpZ2dlc3QtZGVmaWNpdC1kZWNhZGUtMjAyNC1zYXlzLWpvaG5zb24tbWF0dGhleS0yMDI0LTA1LTA4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E60F6807F0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL21hcmtldHMvY29tbW9kaXRpZXMvcGxhdGludW0tc2V0LWJpZ2dlc3QtZGVmaWNpdC1kZWNhZGUtMjAyNC1zYXlzLWpvaG5zb24tbWF0dGhleS0yMDI0LTA1LTA4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vY2hpY2Fnby5zdW50aW1lcy5jb20vc3ByaW5nZmllbGQvMjAyNC8wNS8wOC9tYXlvci1icmFuZG9uLWpvaG5zb24tc3ByaW5nZmllbGQtcHJpdHprZXItY3BzLWJlYXJzLXN0YWRpdW0tZWR1Y2F0aW9u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Johnson’s Springfield trip was for relationships not budgets or Bears,"SPRINGFIELD — Mayor Brandon Johnson said he came to Springfield on Wednesday to fight for equitable education funding and to make sure Chicago receives its fair share of resources.

But there was more geniality than specificity in private meetings with Gov. J.B. Pritzker and legislative leaders just three weeks before a self-imposed May 24 spring session adjournment date.

Democrats were prepared to talk to Johnson about his Monday reference to $1 billion owed to Chicago Public Schools due to years of underfunding under the state’s school funding formula — but the issue wasn’t even broached during a nearly 30-minute meeting with the governor.

And the mayor’s controversial support for a new lakefront Chicago Bears stadium also wasn’t a focal point of the meeting.

Johnson told reporters he reminded Pritzker and legislative leaders that Chicago is the economic engine of the state and deserves its “fair share of resources.

“It’s also to continue to build relationships with the opportunity that we have in this moment as a state to really build the type of operation that speaks to equity injustice. This is a unique chance for us to do that” Johnson said of his trip. “So it’s a level-setting. It’s making sure that we’re building on relationships but it’s also clear that in order for the state of Illinois to be the great state that it is that the city of Chicago has to have its fair share of resources.”

Johnson called discussions with the Illinois General Assembly about the Bears “ongoing” dubbing Soldier Field a “structural damaged situation that really needs a solution.” The Bears last week met with Pritzker aides who highlighted their opposition to the plan. The governor’s office last week called the proposal a “nonstarter” after the meeting.

“And that’s what this is about providing solutions to a problem … like everything else I’ve inherited” Johnson said.

It was the Chicago mayor’s first trip to the state capitol since taking office. Johnson also met with Pritzker and legislative leaders in Springfield in April 2023 in a ceremonial visit weeks before he was sworn in.

Johnson defended the timing of his visit — and his late-in-the-game budgetary asks — saying “We’re at the right time.”

“You know when stuff gets done. So we’re down here at the right time” Johnson said.

Several members of the Chicago City Council Black Caucus also met privately with Illinois House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch on Wednesday in what was dubbed an informal city lobbying day. Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) the mayor’s hand-picked Education Committee chair said it marked the first time in five years that members of the caucus had come to Springfield.

“The thing we’ll do next year is we’ll come in January. We come earlier. We get earlier access” Taylor said. “We can get a lot of those things that we’re looking for.”

Taylor said her requests included funding for infrastructure and investments in education some narrower than the mayor’s.

“He’s advocating for some of the same things we are but remember it’s 50 other folks. It’s just 20 of us as the Black Caucus and so he’s advocating on the entire city. We have specific asks for the South and West sides” Taylor said.

“Him coming down is a great thing. Him coming down with us didn’t make or break us because now the other caucuses have to do their due diligence to come down here as well.”

During Johnson’s closed-door meetings the Illinois Senate Executive Committee quietly cleared an education measure that Johnson and the Chicago Teachers Union had opposed.

The bill was initially intended to stop the Chicago Board of Education from closing or making any changes to selective enrollment schools until 2027 when the board will be fully elected. It was a response to a resolution passed by the CPS board that called for a plan to invest in neighborhood schools and move away from school choice.

The measure the Senate committee passed Wednesday cleared the House last month. It included a moratorium on all Chicago school closings until 2027 — and it would also stop the Chicago Board of Education from changing standards of admission for selective enrollment schools. The measure must still clear the full Senate.

Johnson said he has had discussions with lawmakers to amend the measure: “Those amendments are being assessed and analyzed now.”

As for whether he felt snubbed by the Senate’s approval during his visit the mayor countered that he understood the “process.”

“There’s a process that the General Assembly goes through” Johnson said. “I understand that process and we’re going to stick to that process.”

They have everything imaginable. Most Walmart locations even have an auto maintenance section known as the Auto Care Center. These Walmart garages are mainly known for affordable battery replacement services. However if you are considering getting a Walmart brand car battery it is essential to know what the brand is and where it comes from.

What services does Walmart offer at its auto centers?

For those unfamiliar with Walmart Auto Care Centers the idea of having maintenance done on their cars at Walmart may seem like an odd idea. However these centers are legitimate garages and Walmart states that the employees at Auto Care Centers are certified technicians.

You can get oil changes tire services and general maintenance at a Walmart Auto Care Center. For oil changes Walmart offers standard semi-synthetic and synthetic oil. The technicians at the Auto Care Center can also install new oil filters.

Walmart sells tires and the Auto Care Center offers tire mounting services. Technicians also can check tire pressure rotate tires and repair flats. They perform various other maintenance services as well including headlight restoration and wiper blade installation. Finally Walmart Auto Care Centers are known for their battery services.

Walmart brand batteries explained

Walmart brand batteries are known as EverStart batteries but Walmart does not manufacture these car batteries. Instead Drivin’ & Vibin’ states that multiple manufacturers produce EverStart batteries for Walmart. This sets Walmart apart from other retailers with car battery brands as other stores typically have a single manufacturer that produces batteries.

One manufacturer responsible for Walmart brand batteries is Clarios. This name may be unfamiliar but its previous name Johnson Controls may be more recognizable. Clarios is a major manufacturer of car batteries and the Drivin’ & Vibin’ article states that up to a third of the world’s cars have Clarios batteries.

East Penn Manufacturing is another EverStart battery producer. Walmart has worked with East Penn Manufacturing for a long time and the manufacturer may be the most well-known company that makes Walmart batteries.

Lastly Exide manufactures Walmart EverStart batteries. Exide is an Indian company that is one of the world’s largest lead-acid battery manufacturers. They are famous for producing submarine batteries for the Indian Navy.

Battery installation at Walmart

EverStart batteries are known for their reliability and affordable prices. The convenience of buying batteries at Walmart also comes from Walmart’s battery installation services. The store offers free installation if you buy an EverStart battery at a Walmart location with an Auto Care Center. Walmart will also take your old battery and you can even get a discount for this.

As for the different types of batteries you can buy at Walmart the entry-level option is the EverStart Value. That name is not a misnomer either as EverStart Value batteries sell for less than $50. Replacement warranties for these batteries are only for a year but the overall value is still hard to beat.

The next tier of Walmart battery is the EverStart Plus which costs less than $80. This added cost comes with an extra year on the battery’s replacement warranty so it would be worth it for drivers worried about needing to replace their batteries.

At the top of Walmart’s battery list is the EverStart Maxx. This high-tier battery can typically be found for less than $120 which is considerably more expensive than the other batteries on the list but it does justify its cost. EverStart Maxx batteries are known to last more than five years and Walmart offers a replacement warranty of three years for them.",,,,,,,,,

The expanded leave policy will take effect Jan. 1 according to an internal memo shared with the Observer.

The previous policy only gives 16 weeks of leave to employees who were considered the primary caregiver. Non-primary parents are eligible for six weeks of leave. JPMorgan’s parental leave was the target of a 2017 complaint filed by a male employee at the bank who said it was biased against fathers. The plaintiff who filed his complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) applied for 16 weeks of leave but was denied it because he didn’t qualify as the primary caregiver which was presumably the birth mother. At the time JPMorgan only offered two weeks of parental leave to non-primary caregivers. In 2019 the bank agreed to pay $5 million to settle the claim and clarify its gender neutral parental leave policy.

With its expanded policy JPMorgan is catching up with its competitors most of whom now offer at least 16 weeks of paid leave to both parents. But just because parental leave is becoming more equitable on Wall Street doesn’t mean all employees are taking advantage of it. Only 72 percent of male financial professionals said they were comfortable taking all the paid parental leave offered to them according to a February 2020 LinkedIn survey compared to 92 percent of women.

Here’s how JPMorgan’s new policy stacks up against several other major banks.

Goldman Sachs

In 2019 Goldman Sachs bumped up its parental leave to 20 weeks and extended the benefit to all parents regardless of who is the primary caregiver. The investment bank also offers stipends for family planning services such as adoption surrogacy and egg retrieval or donation.

The policies come as the company has been working to recruit more women into its ranks although the highest levels of the bank remain dominated by men. Its 2022 partner class the most diverse ever is 29 percent female.

Bank of America

Bank of America offers new parents up to 16 weeks of paid leave as well as an additional 10 weeks of unpaid leave. The leave applies to both parents regardless of gender and can be split up if it’s taken in the first year that a child is born. If a parent wants to take eight weeks of leave then return to work for three weeks before taking another eight weeks of leave for example that’s possible under Bank of America’s benefits.

The bank first expanded its parental leave from 12 weeks to 16 weeks in 2016.

Morgan Stanley

In December Morgan Stanley announced it would expand its parental leave to 16 weeks for all parents. Previously the bank had only offered four weeks to non-primary caregivers. It also began offering six to eight additional weeks of medical leave to employees following pregnancy.

The bank was scrutinized for its treatment of pregnant employees back in 2019 when a former Morgan Stanley vice president filed a complaint with the EEOC alleging she received a negative performance review when she revealed she was pregnant and was later fired after her maternity leave ended. At the time Morgan Stanley said it was “committed to a workplace that is supportive of working mothers.”

Citigroup

The bank expanded its parental leave policy in 2020 to offer all “birthing parents” a minimum of 16 weeks leave. Those who don’t give birth receive eight weeks of paid parental leave—this benefit applies to all employees regardless of gender or the type of birth such as adoption or surrogacy.

Citigroup originally increased its maternity leave policy from 13 weeks to 16 weeks in 2016. The bank’s parental leave policy is less generous than some of its peers given non-primary caregivers receive less time off.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyL25vdi8yMC9zdGFrZWhvbGRlci1jYXBpdGFsaXNtLWpwLW1vcmdhbi13YWxtYXJ00gFZaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjIvbm92LzIwL3N0YWtlaG9sZGVyLWNhcGl0YWxpc20tanAtbW9yZ2FuLXdhbG1hcnQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The savior CEO and the empty promise of ‘stakeholder capitalism’,"American CEOs are a self-assured bunch but it takes a certain level of hubris to conclude that your skills making money and climbing the corporate ladder also equip you to solve social and environmental challenges.

While promising to save the world is increasingly part of the chief executive’s job description two timely new books make clear that this grandiose notion remains little more than a self-serving fantasy.

No matter how earnestly they proclaim their support for “stakeholder capitalism” – the popular promise that companies now take care of employees communities the planet and other “stakeholders” not just themselves – profits still come first.

Few chief executives have embraced the CEO-as-world-saver conceit as enthusiastically as Jamie Dimon the head of the $2.6tn investment bank JP Morgan Chase. There’s Dimon lamenting in Time magazine that “policymakers governments and business leaders have done a poor job of helping those who have been left behind.” There’s Dimon concluding a shareholder letter with a rousing call to “acknowledge our problems and work together” to “lift up those who need help and society as a whole”. And there’s Dimon taking a knee at a Chase bank branch ostensibly in solidarity with the global Black Lives Matter uprising.

New York Times reporter Emily Flitter captures the insurmountable contradictions of stakeholder capitalism in her important and infuriating new book The White Wall: How Big Finance Bankrupts Black America. In 2014 Flitter recounts JP Morgan started making philanthropic contributions and “for-profit capital allocations” to the city of Detroit Michigan to “address some of Detroit’s biggest economic hurdles” as Dimon would later phrase it. Accompanying each investment was Flitter writes “a media blitz that made it seem like JP Morgan bankers had galloped into a completely deserted hellscape and brought it back to life”.

Over the next five years the bank directed some $155m to Detroit. That’s not an insignificant amount of money – unless you compare it to JP Morgan’s own earnings or its CEO’s compensation. As Flitter points out that $155m represented “0.03% of its profits over the same period”. A Guardian review of JP Morgan’s annual proxy statements calculates that between 2015 and 2019 roughly the same window as JP Morgan’s work in Detroit the bank’s board (which Dimon chairs) awarded Dimon more than $135m in compensation.

Part of the justification the company gave for Dimon’s 2019 pay was his support for “a diversity and inclusion strategy that attracts motivates and retains top talent”. In a memo to JP Morgan employees a few weeks after the murder of George Floyd Dimon wrote: “Let us be clear – we are watching listening and want every single one of you to know we are committed to fighting against racism and discrimination wherever and however it exists.” Yet as Flitter reveals with devastating clarity from sidelining Black employees to offering Black customers inferior lending terms and investment products to promoting predatory practices in predominantly Black communities such commitments are often little more than empty rhetoric.

Empty rhetoric does nothing to address the racism that remains deeply entrenched in finance but that doesn’t mean rhetoric is pointless – at least for executives. “The anodyne talk of diversity can be used as a shield against discussions of specific and unflattering problems” Flitter writes which “also helps keep the topics of racism and representation on the margins of corporate life”. The ultimate outcome of performative anti-racism is the preservation of the status quo – which is of course the point.

High-profile pledges are also fantastic PR. Flitter notes for instance that “from start to finish” a JP Morgan investigation into its predecessor banks’ historical ties to slavery “was handled by one of the bank’s public relations specialists”. Of the $30bn that formed JP Morgan’s landmark “racial equity commitment” announced to great fanfare in October 2020 Flitter finds that some $28bn “was made up of activities that were part of the bank’s normal business and were now being counted as specifically good for closing the racial wealth gap”. (Earlier this year JP Morgan agreed to a third-party audit of the $30bn pledge.)

In the fall of 2019 rhetoric also helped land Dimon and two other CEOs on the cover of Fortune magazine. At the time Dimon was leading the Business Roundtable a lobbying group for CEOs of American companies. During Dimon’s tenure the organization earned glowing headlines and effusive praise from business and media elites by issuing a statement that claimed to “redefine … the purpose of the corporation to promote ‘an economy that serves all Americans’” including by “foster[ing] diversity and inclusion dignity and respect”. (The statement came less than a year after JP Morgan paid some $24m to settle a racial discrimination lawsuit filed by employees.)

According to Fortune Dimon and the Business Roundtable had begun a “reexamination” of the group’s stated commitment to prioritizing stock prices at a “testy dinner” the previous year. One person who attended that dinner with Dimon was Rick Wartzman the author of the new book Still Broke: Walmart’s Remarkable Transformation and the Limits of Socially Conscious Capitalism.

Soon after the Business Roundtable released its statement Dimon was succeeded as head of the group by a fellow stakeholder capitalism enthusiast and a key player in Wartzman’s narrative: Doug McMillon Walmart’s chairman and CEO. McMillon speaks incessantly about how Walmart is committed to all of its stakeholders particularly its 2.3 million employees. The company Wartzman writes “very much sees itself as part of this new wave of capitalism”.

Still Broke traces Walmart’s history through the lens of the company’s employees. This unexpectedly engaging book portrays a company making progress but of a very narrow sort: the type of progress that happens on executives’ terms not workers’; the type of progress that is considered progress only because the starting point was so bad. It’s the type of progress in other words that aptly reflects most corporations’ social and environmental responsibility efforts.

Walmart’s approach to worker organizing serves as a case in point. “If there is one thing that runs as deep in Walmart’s DNA as its devotion to keeping costs down and prices low it would have to be its antipathy toward organized labor” Wartzman writes. In the 1990s the company “tracked employee attitudes” to generate a “Union Probably Index” that would allow it to better target stores that might be inclined to organize.

Years later Walmart hired the elite PR firm (and vocal stakeholder capitalism proponent) Edelman to fight labor efforts; one outcome was “Working Families for Walmart” an astroturf organization paid for by Walmart and “housed in Edelman’s Washington offices”. Wartzman also highlights a 2012 Bloomberg investigation that discovered that Walmart was so afraid of the employee organizing initiative Our Walmart that the company “hired an intelligence-gathering service from Lockheed Martin contacted the FBI staffed up its labor hotline ranked stores by labor activity and kept eyes on employees (and activists) prominent in the group”.

Throughout Still Broke Wartzman wrestles openly with two tensions. One is the contrast between Walmart’s genuine progress on certain issues – such as its sustainability efforts or its philanthropic undertakings including its admirably generous response to Hurricane Katrina – and its stubborn unwillingness to raise hourly wages or allow employees to organize. (As the book reveals Walmart’s anti-labor efforts have continued under McMillon.)

The more foundational tension is whether it’s even possible for companies to solve the societal challenges they claim to be determined to fix. In 2015 Walmart finally announced that it would raise its minimum hourly wage to $9 with a further increase to $10 the following year. Like JP Morgan’s investments in the city of Detroit Walmart’s pay bump was a PR bonanza for the company: President Obama called to congratulate McMillon and the company was named to Fortune’s “Change the World” list. Walmart has made that list every year since and the company continues to be celebrated as a paragon of corporate progress.

Yet as Wartzman’s account makes abundantly clear the “mantle of social responsibility” that corporate and media elites have bestowed on Walmart does little for the people who depend on it the most: employees. “After all of that – after all the protests and HR focus groups the headlines and hearings the self-congratulatory speeches and board meetings – here’s where Walmart landed: as of summer 2022 at least half of its US hourly workers still make less than $29000 a year many of them a fair bit less” Wartzman concludes.

As the civil rights activist JoAnne Bland tells Wartzman after she meets with McMillon “They know people can’t live off those wages. How much profit do you need?”

The country’s biggest bank has been quietly piloting a special-purpose credit program this year here and in Dallas Detroit and Miami that allows it to offer more loans to business owners who might have otherwise been rejected.

JPMorgan isn’t changing its lending rules based on race. Instead it is targeting minority-majority neighborhoods across the country with loans and business mentoring. All customers who apply in those areas will benefit from the changes.

Other banks have been working on similar projects and pilots but JPMorgan’s is the first with national reach. The bank says the lending and a program starting next year on credit cards will help the bank open 100000 new accounts over five years.

Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said the bank put a focus on small-business lending when looking at its broader commitment to spend $30 billion on racial equity because of feedback from communities.

“One of the biggest things we heard was ‘Go help our minority small businesses’ "" he said.

In 2021 small businesses owned by people of color were more likely to apply for financing than white-owned firms but were about half as likely to get all the funding they requested according to a Federal Reserve survey. Even minority applicants with good credit scores were less likely to get financing.

The JPMorgan Chase Institute the bank’s in-house think tank found that 90% of businesses in majority-Black Hispanic and Latino communities had less than two weeks of cash on hand compared with a third of businesses in white areas.

In 2019 Dr. Tennille Johnson a pharmacist and admitted fashionista grew tired of her scrubs. She and two partners decided to launch a side business Scrubs to the Rescue selling higher quality and better-fitting uniforms. A longtime Chase customer Dr. Johnson tried to get a loan but was rejected. She was told she hadn’t been in business long enough and didn’t have enough profit.

“What do I need to do to qualify next time?"" she asked herself.

This year Dr. Johnson dove in more fully. She started working with a Chase mentor quit her day job and bought out her partners. She was able to get a Chase credit card and $100000 in loans to expand offerings and hire more staff including her daughter Imani Wilson. Dr. Johnson wants to sign contracts with local medical offices to land bigger sales. She is on track to double her revenue this year to $300000 and expects to do the same next year.

She is working with Chase now on a line of credit that will help her pay for inventory technology and more staff. The 45-year-old says she needs to fund her growth with ideas such as scrub subscriptions. “We want to innovate"" she said.

Banks seek to strike a balance in creating special-purpose lending programs. They don’t want to make loans that are bad for the bank or the customer. They have struggled to change the credit criteria including credit scores cash flows and business history that make it more likely minority applicants are rejected.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has been urging banks to try to solve the issue. As part of that program Citigroup Inc. this summer started a pilot program to lend to minority small-businesses in Los Angeles by changing rules concerning credit scores and requirements around how a business operates.

This summer Chase revamped its small-business lending procedures to consider more information about an entrepreneur including cash flows in and out of their deposit accounts and third-party and fintech data about their businesses. In the few minority cities Chase took the new data and tweaked the criteria for approval including taking lower credit scores.

Chase found that it was increasing lending to minority borrowers said Ben Walter the head of business banking.

“It appears to be doing exactly what it was supposed to do which is closing the gap"" he said.

Sherice and Steve Garner Chase customers who started SouthernQ BBQ and Catering in Houston in 2010 didn’t think the banks would help them. They used their personal bank account and bought equipment with cash after another bank turned them down for a loan for a food truck.

One day Ms. Garner was trying to get a Chase teller to come buy some barbecue when the teller told her she should meet the business bankers.

When Chase lent them $110000 to finish a renovation they were surprised. This March they fulfilled one of their top goals buying their location with a $1 million loan from Chase. They have gone from $400000 in annual revenue to $2 million Ms. Garner said.

“They were supporting us"" Ms. Garner said. “We were doing it the hard way and we didn’t even know it.""

The McKindra family’s dedication to the military dates back to Alex’s great-great grandfather. His father retired from the military as a colonel and McKindra graduated from West Point in 1993 as a captain and then completed a tour of duty as captain in the Air Force.

During his time at Los Angeles Air Force Base McKindra was already planning his post-military career as he also pursued his masters from the University of Southern California during evenings and weekends.

“During my MBA studies I found the coursework on corporate finance to be really interesting” McKindra said. “So I decided to pursue a career in both investment and corporate banking once I graduated with the MBA and left the military.”

These days investment and banking and the military cross paths for McKindra who is the managing director and co-head of Veterans Initiatives for JPMorgan Chase Commercial Banking.

RELATED

Upon leaving the military McKindra felt a strong sense of responsibility to help veterans succeed in their careers. That was inspired by his great-grandfather Reuben Frank McKindra who funded and maintained a schoolhouse in his hometown of Union Chapel Arkansas.

The elder McKindra moved his family to Union Chapel in the late 1800s and also started a family farm in the town that was originally settled by freed Black slaves.

In a JPMorgan Chase profile McKindra talked of the opportunities his great-great grandfather provided community members in the form of mentorships both to start and grow the family farm.

“I would not be in the position I am today if not for the opportunities that mentorship provided” McKindra said. “The farm my family was able to start through the support and mentorship of others has helped to educate and put clothes on every generation of my family since the 1880s.”

His family’s military background made it natural for McKindra to help the many veterans who need a helping hand to find success in the business world after their military days are done.

“Paying it forward to me is very important because the transition from the military to the corporate world can be extremely challenging” he said. “I was fortunate enough to build a strong network through my MBA program. However other vets who leave the military don’t necessarily have that strong business network to tap into.”

After taking the co-head of Veteran Initiatives position McKindra has worked with plenty of military peers through the many programs JPMorgan Chase offers. By serving veterans acquire the leadership skills that can help them succeed in whatever they choose to after their military days are over.

“I strongly believe that veterans have the ability to be successful in any profession or business venture that they choose just based on the leadership and teamwork skills which they gained in the military” McKindra said. “In my view veterans have the super power of both thinking quickly on their feet and finding creative solutions to solve any problems that are unexpected. Based on my experience that’s foundational to being a successful business owner.”"

Network segmentation is a security strategy based around dividing a large network into smaller sections each one isolated from the other.

These distinct network segments are there to limit damage during a breach. If one fails and the bad actors enter the theory is that the remainder of the network will stand strong.

It is a good strategy but it may not be infallible. The segments are there to limit damage during a breach. If one is penetrated the others remain afloat – unless the equivalent of a cyber-iceberg is unleashed.

At the moment cybercriminals gaining enter to one segment can cause damage there. But they are learning ways to infiltrate the other segments once they have established a beachhead in the initial segment. Still segmentation is an important safeguard and will at least slow the bad actors down considerably perhaps giving security enough time to prevent further encroachment once the initial breach is uncovered.

Here are some of the top trends in network segmentation in 2022:

1. Network segmentation growth

Network segmentation in the cloud and the need for network segmentation tools to manage multicloud environments has been a growing trend since 2020 and possibly before according to Davis McCarthy Principal Security Researcher at Valtix a Santa Clara Calif.-based provider of cloud native network security services.

“Many organizations that began migrating their workloads to the cloud during the pandemic are now encountering stringent compliance standards and security risks that are commonly mitigated by adhering to defense in-depth best practices — like network segmentation” McCarthy said.

“Software-defined networking solutions allow for flexible policy management while removing the blind spots for network defenders operating in the cloud.”

2. Zero trust comes of age

As more companies adopt a zero-trust approach to security they are realizing its value in implementing technology solutions such as identity and access management (IAM) and behavioral analytics spheres said Drew Simonis CISO Juniper Networks.

“People will begin to see zero trust as a business transformation not a security program and they will begin unlocking new technology delivery models because of that” Simonis said.

3. SASE adoption accelerates

Secure access service edge (SASE) adoption is another area that Juniper Networks believes to be critical to enterprise security. Thus its growth is expected to accelerate.

However users are now more carefully assessing the solutions and path that’s right for them. Teams are being more careful in calculating the operational costs of disparate policy formats. They are also considering the additional burden placed on the teams responsible for managing heritage on-site firewalls while adding the new service-based cloud offerings. Conclusion: existing data center investments and private applications aren’t going away anytime soon according to Mike Spanbauer senior director and technology evangelist Juniper Networks.

“Format inconsistencies create fractures in policy and security efficacy which actors look for” Spanbauer said.

“All that’s needed is one foothold and once the initial policy barrier is bypassed a critical line of defense is disarmed.”

SASE is one way to limit the damage from incursions.

4. Microsegmentation

Network segmentation cuts the network into a few slices.

Microsegmentation takes things a stage further by splitting it into scores of distinct elements each one with some degree of separation.

This is largely being driven by cloud adoption and by the major cloud service providers.

According to Omdia research 57% of virtual machines and 45% of software containers are expected tp be located in CSP-owned data centers by the end of 2022. This is giving rise to growing usage of container-as-a-service whereby the CSP engineers the features of the clouds they create for customers to eliminate the need for in-house skills. As CSPs are orchestrating the cloud and using more software containers microsegmentation of application architectures has become increasingly necessary. Omdia notes that CSPs now offer services that include automated orchestration for software containers and OpenStack orchestrated clouds for virtualized as well as bare metal servers.

Looking ahead expect CSPs to continue to enhance their as-a-service portfolios such as PaaS and IaaS via the introduction of innovative services like deep learning data analytics and IoT solutions designed for the latest edge deployments. These services will require fine-tuned network segmentation and microsegmentation as an essential security feature.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzExLzIwL2lzLWNpc2NvLXN5c3RlbXMtc3RvY2stYS1idXktbm93L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Cisco Systems Stock a Buy Now?,"The networking giant's growth is accelerating again.

Cisco's (CSCO -0.44%) stock price jumped 5% on Thursday Nov. 17 after the networking hardware and software giant posted its latest earnings report. For the first quarter of fiscal 2023 which ended on Oct. 29 Cisco's revenue rose 6% year over year to $13.63 billion and beat analysts' estimates by $340 million. Its adjusted earnings rose 5% to $0.86 per share which also cleared the consensus forecast by two cents.

Does that steady growth indicate Cisco's stock is worth buying again after being buffeted by macroeconomic headwinds over the past year? Let's review its previous challenges and its recent progress to decide.

Why were investors worried about Cisco?

Last September Cisco set some promising long-term goals during its investor day presentation. It predicted its revenue and adjusted EPS would both increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5% to 7% between fiscal 2021 and 2025 driven by the expansion of its subscription-based software and cybersecurity businesses.

But over the past year Cisco's secure and agile networks division (which houses its switches enterprise routers and other wireless and access point hardware) struggled with supply chain disruptions component shortages and rising freight costs. The growth of that segment -- which generated 46% of its revenue last year -- decelerated throughout all of fiscal 2022 and declined 1% year over year in the fourth quarter. Its collaboration business which brought in 9% of its revenue last year also continued to wither as it struggled to keep pace with Zoom Video Communications and Microsoft Teams.

Those headwinds offset the stable growth of its end-to-end security and optimized applications businesses (16% of its fiscal 2022 revenue) as well the inorganic growth of the internet of the future division (10% of its revenue) which had been driven by its acquisition of Acacia Communications last March. As a result Cisco's revenue growth flatlined in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2022 -- which cast a dark cloud over its ambitious investor day targets.

Why did Cisco's latest report clear away those clouds?

Cisco's first quarter report allayed those fears for three reasons. First its secure and agile networks revenue rose 12% year over year -- on top of its 10% growth a year ago -- driven by strong sales of its networking hardware and a gradual easing of the supply chain headwinds. Its end-to-end security and optimized applications segments also continued to grow.

Those improvements boosted Cisco's revenue by 6% year over year during the first quarter. It expects that momentum to continue with 4.5%-6.5% growth in both the second quarter and the full year. CFO Scott Herren also reaffirmed the company's investor day goals of achieving 5%-7% revenue and earnings growth over the ""long term"" during the conference call.

Second Cisco's margins are stabilizing. Its adjusted gross margin still shrank 150 basis points year over year to 63% in the first quarter -- mainly due to the impact of supply chain headwinds on its product gross margins -- but only declined 30 basis points sequentially. That compares favorably to its sequential drop of 200 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2022. Looking ahead Cisco expects its adjusted gross margin to finally rise sequentially to 63%-64% in the second quarter. That's a bright green flag that suggests its supply chain headwinds are finally dissipating.

Lastly that gross margin expansion prompted Cisco to provide upbeat earnings guidance for the rest of fiscal 2023. It expects its adjusted EPS to increase 0%-2% in the second quarter and to rise 4%-7% for the full year. That's slightly higher than its prior full-year guidance for 4%-6% growth.

Cisco's stock is finally worth buying again

Cisco's stock lost more than a quarter of its value this year as investors fretted over its supply chain challenges and shrinking gross margins. However its first-quarter report suggests those problems are transitory -- and that it's still well-poised to generate stable growth for the foreseeable future.

At $46 per share Cisco trades at just 13 times this year's earnings. It also pays an attractive forward dividend yield of 3.3% which accounts for less than half of its projected EPS for fiscal 2023. By comparison Cisco's smaller rival Juniper Networks also trades at 13 times forward earnings but pays a lower forward dividend yield of 2.8%.

Cisco certainly isn't a stock for growth-oriented investors. However investors who are looking for a stable blue-chip tech stalwart that is cheap and generates consistent dividends should consider picking up some shares today.",,,,,,,,,

Companies can still sign up

Companies that still sign up for the pioneer pilot until 15 January 2023. Companies will complete a two-week intensive onboarding to get ready.

Karen Lowe director of 4 Day Week SA says thanks to the growing interest in a reduced hour working week a second pilot is planned to start in May 2023.

“Smaller companies and those in the professional services sector are generally the early trialists of a four-day week because it is easier for them to make big changes but we help companies of all sizes across different industry sectors to take a carefully imagined approach to adopting this new way of working.”

She says the organisation is actively recruiting for the second pilot with signup closing on 28 February 2023.

Lowe says South African pilot participants will test out a new way of working recognised as a way to support and empower workers enhance organisational productivity and have a positive impact on societies and the environment.

It is based on the 100-80-100™ model which prescribes 100% of the pay 80% of the time in exchange for a commitment to delivering 100% of the output. They will be supported by 4 Day Week Global the experts running trials all over the world in collaboration with 4 Day Week SA.

Research findings from trials across the globe make a clear case for the four-day week. Lowe says this is illustrated by the fact that midway through the current trial in the UK most participating companies say they had no loss of productivity during the experiment and a significant improvement in some cases.

There were also positive results from trials run in Ireland and the US expected to be released at the end of November.

60% would be happy to work 4 days a week

A recent survey conducted by Auto & General Insurance among 3 500 participants found that 71% of the respondents were once again office bound following the Covid-19 shut-down and 52% of them said their workplace did not offer a flexible working policy.

It is therefore no surprise then that over 60% thought the 4-day work week was an excellent idea.

When asked what they would do with the extra day 32% said they would spend more time with family 18% would use the time to study 16% would explore personal business endeavours and 12% would rest and recharge.

“The workplace of the future prioritises wellbeing flexibility and sustainability. Whether that comes in the form of a 4-day week a hybrid policy or a commute-worthy office environment it is the cornerstone of an attractive employee value proposition” Ricardo Coetzee head of Auto & General Insurance says.

He says he noted an uptick in requests for Auto & General’s drive less/pay less vehicle insurance product Coffee which was launched during the height of the pandemic.

“While work from home may now be a pipedream for many South Africans it is still business unusual. At Auto & General a number of our employees are blending in-office and remote work and the popularity of our Coffee product suggests that our customers’ employers are too.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZm1hbHRhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2Jlc3Bva2UtZWR1Y2F0aW9uYWwtc29sdXRpb24tZGVzaWduZWQtY29tcGFueS1zLW5lZWRzLjk5NTY5N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A bespoke educational solution designed for any company's needs,"KPMG’s educational arm draws on a vast compliment of lecturing staff all of whom are experienced in their own field to provide an unrivalled multidisciplinary skill set. Education is often referred to as the key to the future. The younger generations are encouraged to extend their studies further to obtain qualifications with a view to be more competitive on the labour market. Equally persons who are already in the workforce are encouraged to keep up to date with the latest developments in their field and gain new skills throughout their lives.

This relatively new reality has meant that several educational institutions have started to offer their services in Malta yet few have the added advantages that KLA offers as Jonathan Dingli Partner and Head of KPMG Learning Academy (KLA) explains.

“KLA is a unique educational institution that welcomes students from the business world providing a bespoke offering” Dr Dingli said.

“KLA’s tutors and lecturers are all seasoned professionals who have a wealth of experience to share with their students. In fact subjects at KLA are all taught by specialist practitioners in their own field who are best positioned to provide their students with actual insights and anecdotes that help them understand the subject matter better. Our lecturers can also share their experience from the field and apply the theory to actual real-world circumstances providing this unique combination of academic training and hands-on experience” Dr Dingli added.

Filling a gap in the market KLA started providing Online CPE courses in 2013 and hasn’t looked back since.

“Back then an eternity before COVID or before any of us could ever predict how the online world would become such a natural extension to our physical lives we had started offering online CPE courses. This was an innovative solution for the busy professionals who found it to be more convenient to obtain precious CPEs from the comfort of their offices” Dr Dingli recalled.

Assures a superior service

KLA soon started providing ACCA tuition which today is a core service the academy provides and a backbone to the accounting profession. Dr Dingli himself a lecturer has taught ACCA in a number of countries including Poland Greece The Netherlands and China. KLA jointly offers the ACCA qualification with Kaplan a prestigious and world-renowned ACCA tuition and content provider having specialised tutors with experience in each practice.

“Today we have grown to provide a myriad of subjects from the technical to the softer skills as the academy is looking to diversify its educational offering. For example we have now started offering a learning suite dedicated to ESG (Environment Social and Governance) a crucial subject for any company. Another suite of subjects we offer is dedicated to leadership which provides courses that cover topics such as emotional intelligence and other softer skills that are required for any professional not just accountants” Dr Dingli said.

In fact the subjects delivered by KLA can vary from Organisational Psychology to Value Added Tax legislation and requirements Valuations Financial Reporting and Complex Consolidations Accountancy for non-Accountants ESG and several others.

In addition KLA is exceptionally geared towards designing specialised ad hoc solutions for companies according to their specific needs.

“At KLA we are proud to offer a bespoke B2B service which is designed to help companies avail themselves of the courses they truly need as opposed to enrolling their employees for seminars that would contain elements which are not required by their team” Dr Dingli remarked. “Apart from the standard packages that our academy offers we are also open to design courses according to the needs of our customers following an informed conversation with the client. Our expertise in the field assures a superior service and exceptional attention to detail”

KLA in fact draws on the vast compliment of lecturing staff all of whom are experienced in their own field to provide an unrivalled multidisciplinary skill set.

“This way we live up to our promise of cutting through complexity by turning it into simplicity throughout the process. A Human Resources Manager won’t need to deal with five or six different training institutions to make sure their teams are being given all the tools needed to be at the top of their game – we are confident that we can provide excellent tuition and training in all fields” Dr Dingli added.

KLA also forms part of the wider KPMG international network making it part of a large network of professional firms. “The opportunities are virtually endless and resources limitless” Dr Dingli claims as KLA from time to time brings over specialist international speakers who continue to add more value to the KLA educational offering.”

Looking to the future Dr Dingli is quite ambitious for the academy which has been very successful in the last years.

“We want to continue building on the excellent results we have achieved and continue providing quality education and training to more and more companies in the future” Dr Dingli asserts. “We have the potential of turning KLA into a fully-fledged campus which on top of the undergrad certifications we already offer would confidently venture into Master’s Degrees Bachelors and Diplomas territory” Dr Dingli affirmed.

“We have the experts in the various fields and the drive to make KLA a leading educational institution in Malta. We can’t wait to help more and more companies gear up through a bespoke educational journey.”",,,,,,

Way in the back of the grocery store at the end of the sleepy baking aisle sits a brand decades past its prime: Jell-O gelatin.

Today Jell-O is served to patients at hospitals. Or schoolchildren throw it around during food fights at lunch and college kids swallow it down with alcohol shots. Others associate Jell-O with the disgraced comedian Bill Cosby who was the face of the brand for 30 years. Jell-O molds and now-defunct flavors like Italian salad and mixed vegetables are in recipe books for “nauseating” foods.

“Jell-O is kind of associated nowadays in our culture with illness and frailty and vulnerability. So it certainly doesn’t have the fun associations that it did when I was growing up” said Rachel Herz a neuroscientist and the author of “Why You Eat What You Eat.”

But Jell-O once gave middle-class consumers access to a luxurious food that had only been accessible to the wealthy. Then Jell-O turned into a salad a staple dish of the mid-twentieth century and morphed into a fun snack for kids. It was adaptable and versatile. Jell-O became a figure of speech and the state food of Utah where the state’s large Mormon population is known for its devotion to the product. Jell-O even went to space.

It was this country’s national dessert eaten by presidents at the White House depicted in advertising by leading actors and artists and a symbol of Americana.

Jell-O “displays so many elements of the American character” wrote Carolyn Wyman in her 2001 book “Jell-O: A Biography.” Jell-O is the “food that most resembles a toy.”

But how did a brand once marketed as “America’s Most Famous Dessert” become an afterthought today?

A dessert for the rich

The genius of Jell-O was to transform an elegant complex dessert and make it cheap and easy to make.

Desserts with gelatin which is essentially purified glue have a luxurious history. During the Victorian era in Europe decorative gelatin molds were a symbol of high society and served to royalty. Gelatin desserts were for the elite who had cooks and servants to labor through the elaborate and time-consuming process of making gelatin often extracted from the feet of calves or other animal parts.

“If ever there was a food calling out for a convenience product solution it was gelatin” Wyman wrote.

In 1897 Pearle Wait a carpenter in LeRoy a small town outside of Rochester New York found an answer to the problem. Wait who dabbled with developing cough remedies and teas added flavoring and coloring to granulated gelatin a flavorless food ingredient.

Wait came up with a sweet flavored powder that could be added to boiled water cooled and was ready to serve. The first flavors of his product which were extracted from natural fruits were orange lemon strawberry and raspberry. (It’s not known exactly how he added the colors.)

Wait trademarked a name for his invention Jell-O based on an idea from his wife May. How she landed on the name has been lost to history but some historians believe it was inspired by the product Grain-O a substitute for coffee that was also made in LeRoy by the Genesee Pure Food Company.

Wait couldn’t get his new product off the ground. In 1899 he sold the rights to Jell-O to Genesee for $450.

Jell-O’s fortunes quickly changed under Genesee. Orator Woodward the owner of the company turned over the advertising which was in its nascent stages to ad firms in New York.

The advertising targeted at women in magazines like Ladies’ Home Journal stressed how easy the new product was to make — and for only 10 cents about the cost of a loaf of bread.

Genesee tried to turn Jell-O into a brand consumers would ask for by name and salesmen would go door-to-door to local grocers to persuade them to place ads of Jell-O in windows and behind the counters. The ads depicting fancy Jell-O molds in startling new colors stood out. Jell-O also distributed free recipe books a new marketing strategy at the time.

By 1907 Jell-O sales crossed $1 million.

Jell-O Girl

Early Jell-O advertising depicted women as inept needing the help of a simple recipe like Jell-O.

“How often some ingredient is forgotten or not rightly proportioned and the dessert spoiled” ran another ad. “I couldn’t keep a house without Jell-O.”

Early ads emphasized the beauty and glamor of these desserts that were formerly unattainable to the average household said Wendy Woloson a historian at Rutgers University-Camden who studies consumer culture in 19th-century America. “Even you can serve this dessert to your family without the use of a servant.”

Jell-O “was able to democratize access to a dessert that had formerly been a high end luxury type of dessert only available to the rich” Woloson added. “That was really significant.”

In 1904 Jell-O introduced the Jell-O Girl which helped reinforce the idea that children loved Jell-O and that it was so simple to make a child could do it.

The Jell-O Girl was the face of the brand for almost 40 years. Rose O’Neill a famous artist who created the Kewpie doll created “Jell-O and The Kewpies” ads for the brand featuring the dolls and the Jell-O Girl.

By 1925 Geneese sold Jell-O to the Postum Cereal Company (which would eventually become the giant General Foods and is Kraft Heinz today) for $67 million.

Jell-O salads

Jell-O shifted during its next phase.

During the Great Depression and World War II era Jell-O was pitched as an affordable food a way to turn a few ingredients into a family meal people could use to stretch their dollars.

Again Jell-O leaned on new advertising to stand out.

It was one of the first companies to advertise on radio sponsoring popular comedian Jack Benny’s radio program in 1934. Benny popularized the jingle “J-E-L-L-O” to millions of listeners and it was one of the most successful partnerships in radio advertising history. “Jell-O again! This is Jack Benny talking.”

Although Jell-O initially was marketed primarily as a sweet dessert it took on a new life as a savory salad driven in part by the introduction of lime Jell-O in 1930.

“Jell-O Salads Welcome! say the women of America!” read an early ad displaying Jell-O as a salad.

“Shimmering…luscious…Jell-O salads are making this a salad nation!” said another ad in The Farmer’s Wife magazine.

Jell-O congealed salads often made with fruits vegetables Cool whip or other foods were used to show off at dinner parties and a form of creative expression.

Jell-O released flavors such as seasoned tomato celery mixed vegetable and Italian salad and Jell-O salads were a colorful way to use leftovers in side dishes. In 1955 the company introduced the slogan “A Jell-O salad makes the meal.”

“The Jell-O salad really hits the American sensibility and palate perfectly. Americans have a longtime sweet tooth” said Laura Shapiro a culinary historian and author of “Perfection Salad” about women and cooking at the turn of the twentieth century.

“This is the most American thing of all. Nobody but us thinks that a salad is a red molded strawberry flavored thing on a lettuce leaf. But that was one of the big attractions of Jell-O – you could eat a dessert and call it a salad.”

Jell-O was marketed as a light satisfying ending to a meal even if people were stuffed – typified by its successful 1960s campaign slogan “There’s always room for Jell-O.”

But as more Americans traveled and global cuisines entered the mainstream the simplicity of Jell-O salads became a downside. Julia Child brought French cooking to American kitchens and Jell-O seemed bland.

“Upscale becomes the new mainstream and Jell-O salads moves into a niche” Shapiro said. “Jell-O salads started to look unsophisticated and kind of an antique. They started to look a little silly.”

Jell-O sales peaked in 1968 and then begin a decline of about 2% of a year for two decades according to Jell-O biographer Wyman. By 1987 the company sold about half as many boxes as it did two decades prior.

Cosby

With Jell-O salads becoming less popular the brand looked for its next hit.

But it had a problem: With the increase in women entering the workforce families weren’t sitting down for as many meals and eating dessert like they once did. And new ready-to-eat foods were hitting the market that were more convenient.

What was once considered a quick and easy dessert now took too long to make for consumers especially moms Jell-O’s longtime target customer.

“It was starting to be looked at as a chore in the mid 1980s” said Chris Becker who led the Jell-O account at Young & Rubicam Jell-O’s longtime advertising agency. “It was perceived as old-fashioned and was creating dust in the cupboard.”

Jell-O began to pivot into new products such as single-serve cups ready-to-eat Pudding Pops and frozen Gelatin Pops. It transitioned from targeting moms to marketing the product as a snack for kids and one time-starved parents could bond with their kids over making together.

In 1990 Jell-O launched a new product that would transform the brand: Jigglers. It was based on a recipe that used four times the usual amount of Jell-O and could be cut into squares. Jell-O launched a marketing blitz with supermarket displays Jiggler giveaways and ads with Bill Cosby.

Cosby had been working with Jell-O since the 1970s as the face of Jell-O’s pudding lineup but Jigglers was the first gelatin commercials he appeared in. An ad showed Cosby and kids at a formal dinner tossing their spoons to eat the new Jigglers “with our bare hands.”

Cosby “brought that advertising to a different level” Chris Becker said. “He became the brand.”

While no longer the powerhouse it once was Jell-O continued to innovate to meet changing consumer tastes.

Kraft in the early 2000’s shifted the focus of Jell-O’s advertising away from kids and toward adults. It pitched sugar-free Jell-O for example as a treat for Atkins dieters. But as the Atkins diet slipped in popularity it took Jell-O down with it.

Jell-O sales fell 19% from 2009 to 2013 to $753 million the Associated Press reported at the time. Jell-O’s sales have stagnated since. In 2022 they were $688 million according to IRI.

Reviving Jell-O

Jell-O has slumped in recent years because of competition and a lack of investment in the brand.

Kraft tried to restart its Jell-O business when it split into two companies in 2012 said Erin Lash an analyst at Morningstar.

“It never seemed to get off the ground in terms of resonating with consumers and getting over the overhang of being an unhealthy snack” she said.

But perhaps Jell-O’s decline had less to do with the perception that it’s unhealthy than changes in consumers’ lifestyles. New salty and sweet convenience snacks with exciting tastes have emerged. Big brands including Jell-O have faced competition from a proliferation of startups and direct-to-consumer brands.

“Over the course of the last 10 years you’ve had a period where social media and online commerce has made it easier for smaller niche startups” Lash said. “Consumers have been more willing to purchase brands that they were unfamiliar with.”

Jell-O has also become a smaller focus at Kraft Heinz its parent she said and is a tiny piece of its business. Kraft Heinz’s “easy indulgent desserts” business which includes Jell-O makes up just 4% of the company’s total sales.

Jell-O has little presence on Instagram TikTok and social platforms that are crucial to reaching younger shoppers. It also doesn’t advertise on television to try to reconnect Baby Boomers with the brand.

But Kraft Heinz said big changes are coming to Jell-O next year.

“Jell-O is a beloved family brand with an incredible amount of opportunity” Emily Kerschner the vice president of marketing and strategy at Kraft Heinz said in an email.

Next year Jell-O will “undergo its first brand renovation” in a decade and increase its advertisement spending she said. It’s also exploring adjusting the recipe to reduce sugar.

Jell-O still remains a cultural curiosity said Lynne Belluscio the former director of the LeRoy Historical Society and the curator of the Jell-O Museum in the brand’s birthplace.

“We have people come through and they say you know I really like Jell-O. I’m going to go home and have some.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bi5pZS9tb25leS85NzY0NzYyL2hlaW56LWNocmlzdG1hcy1kaW5uZXItc291cC_SAURodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVzdW4uaWUvbW9uZXkvOTc2NDc2Mi9oZWluei1jaHJpc3RtYXMtZGlubmVyLXNvdXAvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Heinz relaunches ‘yummy’ Christmas dinner in a tin with turkey spuds & pigs in blankets – how to get yours...,"XMAS TINNER Heinz relaunches ‘yummy’ Christmas dinner in a tin with turkey spuds & pigs in blankets – how to get yours

(Bill Roth / ADN)

A $25 billion deal that would unite Fred Meyer and Carrs Safeway grocery stores under one corporate umbrella is raising unique concerns in Alaska where the stores are the dominant urban grocers in an isolated state with limited competition.

Kroger the parent company of Fred Meyer and Albertsons parent of Carrs Safeway announced plans to merge last month. The deal if approved by the Federal Trade Commission would create a grocery behemoth affecting food shopping and delivery across most of the U.S.

The two retail giants have said they will invest to improve the customer experience reduce prices and increase wages and worker benefits. Experts say the combined chains will likely be required to sell off some stores in Alaska and other states to keep competition alive though that raises concerns about whether any company can successfully compete against them.

Critics in Alaska echoing national concerns argue that the deal could lead to higher prices as competition and potentially stores are reduced harming neighborhoods jobs and food selection.

But they also point to Alaska’s unique conditions. Nearly all food consumed in the state is shipped here over the ocean and many store shelves already run bare when winter storms delay shipments heightening serious concerns about what a long-running disruption to the state’s food supply would mean.

The Alaska Department of Law which oversees the Consumer Protection Unit would not comment about whether or how it might address the proposed merger.

But a consumer advocacy group and two Alaska lawmakers have separately called on the Federal Trade Commission to stop it.

Anchorage Democratic Reps. Zack Fields and Ivy Spohnholz said in an Oct. 31 letter to commission Chair Lina Kahn that food price increases they say will result from the merger would be “devastating” and “most acute” in Alaska where “food costs are already well above the national average due to high transportation costs.”

[Alaska’s overall economic performance among the worst in US for several years research finds]

“There is extensive peer-reviewed data about the anti-competitive inflationary impacts of reduced competition” the lawmakers wrote. “A transition from a competitive to a largely monopoly market results in higher prices for consumers and less market power and income for front-line workers in the industry.”

A big deal’

Kroger and Albertsons are the nation’s two largest grocery stores with Kroger the biggest. They own 5000 stores nationally serving more than two-thirds of U.S. households. They employ 700000 workers.

“We are bringing together two purpose-driven organizations to deliver superior value to customers associates communities and shareholders” Rodney McMullen the Kroger chairman and CEO said in the announcement last month. McMullen would keep those roles for the combined company.

The companies’ Alaska operations consist of 12 Fred Meyers and 35 Carrs Safeways said Dan Robinson an economist with the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development. The stores compete in the state’s urban areas from Fairbanks to Anchorage to the Kenai Peninsula and in Juneau in Southeast sometimes in close proximity. Many Alaskans just call them “Freddies” and Carrs.

Robinson said he could not disclose the chains’ Alaska employment numbers due to confidentiality laws.

“This is a big deal because those are the two big food and grocery stores especially in urban Alaska and the question is what this will do to competition and prices” Robinson said.

A spokesman with Fred Meyer this week declined to comment. Representatives with Carrs Safeway could not be reached for comment.

In Alaska some stores may need to be sold

The companies anticipate spinning off 100 to 375 stores to create a “new agile competitor” to address regulatory concerns about competition.

Doug Ross an antitrust expert with the University of Washington School of Law said in an interview that the chains’ divestment plan likely includes Alaska because of the close competition in the state though he said the specific stores for divesting have not yet been disclosed.

“I’d say surely the parties understand they have an antitrust issue in Anchorage (and Alaska) and they can’t get their merger through unless they propose a solution to that overlap” he said.

For the merger to happen stores that are divested to other companies must be able to compete as robustly as they did before the merger he said.

But many fear that the combination of Albertsons and Kroger will create a giant with such dominant buying power that any new competitors can’t survive he said.

“They have not indicated how this (divestment plan) will work so it’s possible that the plan provides competition that’s as meaningful as it is today” Ross said. “But if not the FTC will disapprove the merger and I think a federal court would be inclined to disapprove it too.”

‘Carrs-Fred Meyer juggernaut’

Matt Berman an economist with the Institute of Social and Economic Research at the University of Alaska Anchorage pointed out that Alaska has previously experienced a grocery merger that tried to address anticompetitive concerns but failed.

When Safeway took over the Alaska-based Carrs chain for $330 million in 1999 the state under then-Gov. Tony Knowles ordered Safeway to sell seven stores including four in Anchorage.

Alaska Marketplace acquired six of the stores under a consortium that included Associated Grocers of Seattle Alaska Commercial Co. with its rural grocery stores and Bristol Bay Native Corp.

But all six stores closed within 15 months. Critics asserted that the state erred by allowing Safeway to sell off lower-performing stores.

Berman said he foresees challenges to the Albertsons-Kroger plan before the Federal Trade Commission particularly for areas such as Alaska where nearly all store products arrive at the Port of Alaska in Anchorage.

Carrs Safeway and Fred Meyer have a strong supply chain shipping product to the port and in Alaska he said. That’s a critical part of their success and replicating that could be a challenge for any possible competitor he said.

“The question is how could a competitor put that together and compete against a Carrs Fred Meyer juggernaut” he said.

An already ‘fragile’ supply chain

Graham Downey consumer advocate with Alaska Public Interest Research Group said he shops at the Fred Meyer and Carrs Safeway stores in Midtown Anchorage. They’re just a hop across Seward Highway from each other and they often sell food made by different manufacturers.

Downey said he envisions the combined chain downsizing two stores into one in that situation and others in Alaska. That would lead to higher costs for essential foods and household items less product selection and fewer jobs hurting the Alaska economy he argued.

The consumer advocacy group signed onto a letter from the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 400 based in Maryland asking the Federal Trade Commission to block the merger he said. The organization’s Alaska chapter Local 1496 did not respond to requests for comment for this article.

Downey said the proposed merger raises food security concerns because of Alaska’s isolation from the Lower 48.

“More consolidation will make the supply chain more fragile in Alaska” he said. “There will be fewer people making decisions about bringing food up here.”

Alaska Public Interest Research Group is also asking members to sign a letter opposing the merger. The letter will be sent to the state’s congressional delegation Downey said.

Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan a Republican and Rep. Mary Peltola a Democrat did not respond to requests for comment.

Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski’s office said the Federal Trade Commission will evaluate the merger and has responsibility for preventing it from happening if it will cause higher prices reduced competition or negative workforce impacts.

“However this potential merger is still very early in the process and there is not enough existing information for Senator Murkowski to fairly weigh in at this time” Murkowski’s office said in a statement.

Alaska Department of Law mum

Officials with the Alaska Department of Law including its consumer protection division declined to discuss the proposed merger.

Patty Sullivan a spokeswoman with the department said it could not provide details about any future actions it might take. Because of confidentiality laws the department could neither confirm nor deny the existence of antitrust investigations regarding the merger she said.

“The Department of Law is aware of the transaction and is committed to protecting consumers through the vigorous enforcement of Alaska’s antitrust laws” she said.

There are smaller stores selling groceries such as New Sagaya and Natural Pantry in Anchorage Three Bears Alaska in Chugiak and elsewhere in Alaska. But Fields the Alaska lawmaker said smaller stores aren’t true competitors to Carrs and Fred Meyer.

Officials with those smaller stores declined to comment. An official with Alaska Commercial with 34 stores in rural Alaska said the company will continue to focus on its rural operations.

Fields pointed out that Anchorage has other supercenters that sell groceries such as Walmart and Costco. But they’re not full-service grocery stores they’re few in number and they aren’t easily accessible to most neighborhoods.

Fields said he doesn’t see any positives if the stores unite in Alaska.

“This is huge for Alaska” he said. “It will mean loss of jobs higher prices and less selection all negative.”

Live Nation and Ticketmaster merged in 2010 but have come under scrutiny for largely dominating the live event ticket sales market. Ticketmaster has received renewed attention after it dropped the ball with Taylor Swift ticket sales this week.

The DOJ has reached out to venues and “players in the ticket market” in recent months to ask about the company’s practices according to the NYT meaning the probe predates this week’s debacle. DOJ spokesperson Arlen Morales declined to comment.

Live Nation issued a response to antitrust concerns in a post on its website and argues that its practices aren’t anticompetitive. “The Department of Justice itself recognized the competitive nature of the concert promotion business at the time of the Live Nation-Ticketmaster merger” the post reads. “That dynamic has not changed.”

Many government officials have Live Nation and Ticketmaster in their sights as well. The attorneys general of North Carolina and Tennessee are each investigating Ticketmaster. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) the chair of the Senate subcommittee on competition policy antitrust and consumer rights wrote a letter to Live Nation CEO Michael Rapino (pdf) on Wednesday expressing “serious concerns” about competition in the ticketing industry. And Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) tweeted Tuesday that “Ticketmaster is a monopoly” and called for it and Live Nation to be broken up.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb25vbWlzdC5jb20vdGhlLWVjb25vbWlzdC1leHBsYWlucy8yMDIyLzExLzE5L2lzLXRpY2tldG1hc3Rlci1hLW1vbm9wb2x50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Ticketmaster a monopoly?,"N OVEMBER 18TH should have been a momentous day for Taylor Swift’s fans. Tickets for the American leg of the pop star’s tour next year—her first since 2018—were due to be released to the general public on Ticketmaster an online ticket vendor. But on November 17th the company abruptly cancelled the sale saying it had too few tickets left and problems with its ticketing system after a botched early release on November 15th. Ticketmaster had invited fans to register for the pre-release and verified those who could take part. This was an attempt to crack down on bots and ticket touts and to manage high demand. But the sale was plagued with glitches and delays. The firm said over 2m tickets were sold—but many soon appeared on resale sites for eye-watering sums.

The bad blood extends beyond the ranks of infuriated Swifties (as Ms Swift’s vociferous fans are known). The pop star herself expressed frustration with Ticketmaster on social media. Jonathan Skrmetti the Republican attorney-general of Tennessee a state with a huge music industry said he would look into the pre-release fiasco. On Friday Amy Klobuchar the Democratic chair of the Senate antitrust subcommittee said Congress would hold a hearing on Ticketmaster before the end of the year. The New York Times reported that in recent months America’s Department of Justice ( DoJ ) has been investigating whether Live Nation Entertainment ( LNE ) Ticketmaster’s parent company is a monopoly. Is it?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWxtdXNpY25ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvMjAvbGl2ZS1uYXRpb24tc3RvY2stcGx1bmdlcy1mb2xsb3dpbmctdGF5bG9yLXN3aWZ0LXRpY2tldGluZy1maWFzY28v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Live Nation Stock Plunges Following Taylor Swift Fiasco,"Live Nation Stock Plunges Following Taylor Swift Ticketing Imbroglio

Live Nation stock plunges following Taylor Swift ticketing imbroglio.

Shares of Live Nation Entertainment plunged Friday following the Taylor Swift ticketing fiasco of its subsidiary Ticketmaster. Live Nation also issued a statement in defense of Ticketmaster in the wake of the platform’s tech issues against unprecedented demand for Taylor Swift’s upcoming tour.

Additionally reports surfaced that the Justice Department is looking into widespread complaints over Ticketmaster’s handling of the pre-sale auction and first-day rush to buy tickets to Taylor Swift’s tour. Between the imbroglio and subsequent fallout Live Nation saw its shares drop nearly 8% in trading on Friday closing at $66.21.

“Ticketmaster has a significant share of the primary ticketing services market because of the large gap that exists between the quality of the Ticketmaster system and the next best primary ticketing system” Live Nation says in its vigorous defense of the platform asserting that Ticketmaster is “the most transparent and fan-friendly” service of its kind.

“The market is increasingly competitive nonetheless with rivals making aggressive offers to venues. That Ticketmaster continues to be the leader in such an environment is a testament to the platform and those who operate it not to any anticompetitive business practices” the statement continues.

“5 years ago tickets were paper. Now you scan in with your phone and can transfer tickets to your friend with one tap. We innovate and invest in our technology more than any other ticketing company and we will continue to do so.”

Despite Live Nation’s statement in its platform’s defense Ticketmaster has long faced criticism and scrutiny for its business practices. The service suffered a long-running feud with Pearl Jam in the 90s over disagreements concerning pricing and fees.

Now the highly public Swift ticketing issue is hot on the heels of the Justice Department beginning its probe into whether Live Nation has too much control over the live music marketplace. Live Nation is undeniably prominent as a promoter of events while dominating the ticketing sector via Ticketmaster.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvdGF5bG9yLXN3aWZ0LXRpY2tldG1hc3Rlci0xLjY2NTY4MDHSASBodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYmMuY2EvYW1wLzEuNjY1NjgwMQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Taylor Swift breaks silence on Ticketmaster's 'excruciating' meltdown,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvdGF5bG9yLXN3aWZ0LXRpY2tldG1hc3Rlci0xLjY2NTY4MDHSASBodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYmMuY2EvYW1wLzEuNjY1NjgwMQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E60FC4CBE0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvdGF5bG9yLXN3aWZ0LXRpY2tldG1hc3Rlci0xLjY2NTY4MDHSASBodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYmMuY2EvYW1wLzEuNjY1NjgwMQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay8zYW0vdXMtY2VsZWJyaXR5LW5ld3MvdGlja2V0bWFzdGVyLWFwb2xvZ2lzZXMtdGF5bG9yLXN3aWZ0LWZhbnMtMjg1MzU3ODbSAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5taXJyb3IuY28udWsvM2FtL3VzLWNlbGVicml0eS1uZXdzL3RpY2tldG1hc3Rlci1hcG9sb2dpc2VzLXRheWxvci1zd2lmdC1mYW5zLTI4NTM1Nzg2LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ticketmaster apologises to Taylor Swift fans as Justice Department launch probe,"Ticketmaster has apologised after they came under fire to failure to perform a reliable sale of tickets to her latest US tour after she expressed her frustrations

Ticketmaster has issued an apology to fans of Taylor Swift after ticket sales for her Eras tour were plunged into chaos.

The ticket sales business published a statement when fans were left frustrated as their website repeatedly crashed when they were logging on to try and nab a ticket to see Taylor.

They uploaded the apology when Taylor herself also expressed her anger at the failed sale of tickets to her string of shows launched to coincide with the recent release of her album Midnights.

The selling outlet said: “We want to apologize to Taylor and all of her fans – especially those who had a terrible experience trying to purchase tickets. Next we feel we owe it to everyone to share some information to help explain what happened...""

They then outlined a series of reasons for the failure to deliver a reliable sale admitting that their technical infrastructure was not up to the task.

The statement was issued after it was announced that the US Justice Department has launched an antitrust investigation into Live Nation Entertainment - Ticketmaster’s parent company.

The probe will investigate if Live Nation Entertainment is guilty of an abuse of its power in the live music industry.

A New York Times report says that the investigation actually predates this latest controversy.

The investigation has members of the Justice Department’s antitrust division speaking with music venues and industry workers about Live Nation with them maintaining anonymity to aid the probe.

Taylor meanwhile sympathised with her fans in an Instagram post where she admitted her anger at the situation.

She said: “It’s really difficult for me to trust an outside entity with these relationships and loyalties and excruciating for me to just watch mistakes happen with no recourse.

""I’m not going to make excuses for anyone because we asked them multiple times if they could handle this kind of demand and we were assured they could. It’s truly amazing that 2.4million people got tickets but it really p***es me off that a lot of them feel like they went through several bear attacks to get them.”

Taylor then admitted her hope for anyone who had failed to get a ticket to be provided with a fresh opportunity.

She added: “And to those who didn’t get tickets all I can say is that my hope is to provide more opportunities for us to all get-together and sing these songs” she wrote. “Thank you for wanting to be there. You have no idea how much that means.”

Tickets for Taylor's tour went on presale on Tuesday (November 15) but the Ticketmaster website crash left fans disappointed when they could not secure tickets - with many appearing on resale sites for staggering amounts up to $22000 shortly afterwards.

A further general sale was due to go live on Friday (November 19) but was cancelled due to “extraordinarily high demands on ticketing systems and insufficient remaining ticket inventory.”"

Earlier this month at Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works facility in Palmdale California the F414-GE-100 engine was installed. This marks a major milestone as the X-59 approaches the completion of its assembly.

The F414-GE-100 engine from General Electric Aviation measures 13-foot-long and packs 22000 pounds of propulsion energy and will power the X-59 as it flies at speeds up to Mach 1.4 and altitudes around 55000 feet.

“The engine installation is the culmination of years of design and planning by the NASA Lockheed Martin and General Electric Aviation teams” said Ray Castner NASA’s propulsion performance lead for the X-59. “I am both impressed with and proud of this combined team that’s spent the past few months developing the key procedures which allowed for a smooth installation.”

The X-59 team will follow the aircraft’s assembly with a series of ground tests and ultimately first flight in 2023.

NASA’s X-59 is the centerpiece of the agency’s Quesst mission. The aircraft is designed to reduce the sound of sonic booms which occur when an aircraft flies at supersonic speeds to a quiet sonic “thump.” This will be demonstrated when NASA flies the X-59 over communities around the U.S. starting in 2025 with the goal of providing the data necessary to open the future to commercial supersonic flight over land greatly reducing flight times.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS8yMC9wb2xpdGljcy91cy1oeXBlcnNvbmljLWNoaW5hLXJ1c3NpYS1jb21wZXRpdGlvbi9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFSaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMi8xMS8yMC9wb2xpdGljcy91cy1oeXBlcnNvbmljLWNoaW5hLXJ1c3NpYS1jb21wZXRpdGlvbg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US is increasing pace of hypersonic weapons development to chase China and Russia senior admiral says,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS8yMC9wb2xpdGljcy91cy1oeXBlcnNvbmljLWNoaW5hLXJ1c3NpYS1jb21wZXRpdGlvbi9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFSaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMi8xMS8yMC9wb2xpdGljcy91cy1oeXBlcnNvbmljLWNoaW5hLXJ1c3NpYS1jb21wZXRpdGlvbg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E61019F580>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS8yMC9wb2xpdGljcy91cy1oeXBlcnNvbmljLWNoaW5hLXJ1c3NpYS1jb21wZXRpdGlvbi9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFSaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMi8xMS8yMC9wb2xpdGljcy91cy1oeXBlcnNvbmljLWNoaW5hLXJ1c3NpYS1jb21wZXRpdGlvbg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

12 Young Joe The Forgotten Kennedy (1977) This made-for-television movie based on Hank Searls’ book is the story of the oldest and boldest of the Kennedy tribe the confident and charming Joseph P Kennedy Jr. Groomed for greatness by his father — most notably for the presidency — he was the Kennedy child “in whom the parents invested their deepest hope” wrote JFK adviser and Harvard professor Arthur Schlesinger. That hope died when young Joe’s plane exploded in mid-air while on a mission during World War Two. With Peter Strauss as young Joe the movie is entertaining enough although a bit heavy on cheesy script and family frolics — with more than a dollop of Oirishness added into the mix.

11 RFK (2002) Once you get your head around seeing Ken Barlow’s real-life son on screen in the shape of Bobby Kennedy things start to gel reasonably well. Linus Roache ain’t half bad in the role. If you’re looking for a ‘life and times of RFK’ movie though this isn’t it. It deals only with the last few years of the senator’s life. From his brother’s assassination in Dallas to his own fatal shooting five years later in a Los Angeles hotel this film still manages to give a real sense of the man. His daggers-drawn relationship with his brother’s successor Lyndon Johnson is particularly good. JFK appearing as a ghost however is gimmicky and ridiculous.

10 PT 109 (1963) Named after young war-hero JFK’s torpedo boat that was taken out by a Japanese destroyer the making of this movie certainly wasn’t all plain sailing. This being the first time a major studio made a movie about a still-sitting president the White House had approval over everything — including the actor playing Kennedy. JFK requested Warren Beatty. He turned it down. Eventually it went to Cliff Robertson with JFK pronouncing the finished film “a fine job”. But perhaps the most interesting thing of all about PT 109 was the appearance on set of a 15-year-old schoolboy who was keen to watch proceedings. That boy was Steven Spielberg.

9 Bobby (2006) With interesting potential as an ensemble piece that focuses on the lives of some ‘ordinary’ people in the Ambassador Hotel in LA on the night Bobby Kennedy is shot there this shuffles along until the moment of the assassination itself. Then — boom! — the pace picks up and with real footage thrown in for good measure the film finds a rhythm. A big-name movie with Sharon Stone Demi Moore William H Macy Helen Hunt Anthony Hopkins and Martin Sheen all in attendance. The only thing missing here is a conspiracy theory. Let’s at least be thankful for that.

8 Executive Action (1973) This is the first of the JFK conspiracy-theory movies — it’s all rogue FBI agents right-wing industrialists and disgruntled politicians slyly plotting against Kennedy and what they consider to be his liberal agenda. Rattling along at an engaging enough pace it’s big bad Burt Lancaster in the role of black-ops specialist James Farrington who dominates the screen. A mixture of fact and fiction its timing is notable — released almost 10 years to the day after Kennedy’s assassination. But is it convincing? Maybe maybe not…

7 Jackie (2016) The cinematic flashback device is a distraction. The breathy voice of Natalie Portman’s Jackie is irritating — are we supposed to think ‘Marilyn’ every time she opens her mouth? Leaving those two quibbles aside this is an absorbing and visually beautiful film. We are in the days straight after the assassination and Portman plays the stunned and stricken widow with considerable aplomb. Her anxiety distress uncertainty and determination are all writ large — often all at the same time. And the real Jacqueline Kennedy’s patrician sense of entitlement and that hauteur of hers are never far from the surface. Terrific performance.

Full of tension and flitting between exchanges with shady and unscrupulous Soviet diplomats and all kinds of skulduggery from a plethora of war-hungry officials in the Pentagon the drama unfolds through the eyes of presidential aide Kenny O’Donnell — a convincing Kevin Costner. Tottering on the edge of nuclear war it’s touch-and-go all the way. We know the outcome of course. But you won’t breathe easy until the final frame.

""Full of tension the drama unfolds through the eyes of presidential aide Kenny O’Donnell — a convincing Kevin Costner."" Costner left Bruce Greenwood and Steven Culp at the premiere of Thirteen Days on December 19 2000.

5 Chappaquiddick/The Senator (2017) Another Kennedy another drama — and this time it’s Teddy’s turn. Based on the 1969 scandal of the Massachusetts senator leaving young Mary Jo Kopechne to drown after he drove them off a bridge near Martha’s Vineyard this is a disturbing exploration of that event — and the fallout afterwards. The film differently titled on each side of the Atlantic is a great take on the scramble to salvage a political career. Jason Clarke as the terrified but no-blood-on-my-hands Teddy is both convincing and unpalatable. No he wasn’t drunk. No he had no sexual designs on Mary Jo. Really? Bruce Dern’s cameo as Ted’s stroke-ridden but vicious-as-ever father steals the show.

4 Killing Kennedy (2013) The name Kennedy may be prominent in the title but this is Lee Harvey Oswald’s movie. Flitting as it does between the lives of the two men in the years leading to Dallas it’s Will Rothhaar as Oswald who leaves a lasting impression. Rob Lowe covers all the bases as JFK — the presidential election marriage to Jacqueline Bouvier Cuban missile crisis etc. And there’s more than a nod here too to his womanising ways. It’s Oswald’s story though — encompassing his time in Russia his marriage to Marina and his return to downbeat life in Dallas — that is utterly engrossing. And strangely affecting.

""Flitting between the lives of the two men in the years leading to Dallas it’s Will Rothhaar as Oswald who leaves a lasting impression."" (L-R) Actors Jack Noseworthy Will Rothhaar Michelle Trachtenberg director Nelson McCormick and screenwriter Kelly Masterson attend the premiere of Killing Kennedy.

3 Love Field (1992) What’s not to love about Love Field? Here the Dallas assassination (and Love Field airport) is only peripheral to the gentle understated story of Lurene a young Dallas housewife who worships Jackie Kennedy and sets off to Washington DC for the president’s funeral to pay her respects. Effectively a road movie Michelle Pfeiffer plays the beautiful Lurene with great subtlety and grace. It’s a film about loyalty and respect about race relations in 1960s America about friendship and ultimately about love. Michelle Pfeiffer is a knockout. She was robbed of the Oscar in 1993.​

2 JFK (1991) It’s Jim not Jack who is centre stage here — that’s Kevin Costner as former New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison. Riveting brilliantly acted pacy tense and long — very long — this ultimate Kennedy conspiracy movie presents a vision of the assassination that is well simply not true. But this is Oliver Stone’s movie after all so it is in-your-face film-making of the highest order. All the ‘greats’ are in attendance: Tommy Lee Jones Joe Pesci Kevin Bacon Jack Lemmon — and a magnificent Donald Sutherland. It’s a roller coaster of a movie. Supposition? Speculation? Distortion of reality? Yep all of those. But don’t let that spoil the ride.

""Oliver Stone’s movie is in-your-face film-making of the highest order."" Kevin Costner who plays former New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison in the film JFK 1991.

1 Parkland (2013) With its focus on the ‘ordinary’ (but real-life) players on the day of the Dallas assassination this is first-class film-making. From edgy Feds to the doctors and nurses in Parkland hospital this ensemble movie is overwhelming in its depiction of chaos fear disbelief grief and exhaustion. You want to look away but you can’t. And in the quiet confusion yet stoic acceptance of Robert Oswald the assassin’s brother we too find ourselves grieving for all that was lost that day. With factual detail followed to the letter we see how when people simply slip up on the job conspiracy theories can flourish. There’s no conspiracy here. Just ordinary people doing their jobs as best they can. Simply superb.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vYW1jbi5jb20uYXUvZWRpdG9yaWFsL3JhY2UtdHdvLXBoaWxsaXAtaXNsYW5kLXdvcmxkc2JrLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WORLDSBK 2022 | PHILLIP ISLAND RACE TWO,"Bautista Wins Final Race

A red flag stoppage after a two rider crash saw Alvaro Bautista (Aruba.it Racing – Ducati) just ahead of Jonathan Rea (Kawasaki Racing Team) to take his 16th and final race win of his championship winning season.

Alex Lowes (Kawasaki Racing Team) had passed Toprak Razgatlioglu (Pata Yamaha WorldSBK Team) in the race and in doing so he scored a podium finish at the red flag which brought out the chequered flag on the year.

It was an unfortunate end to the final WorldSBK race of 2022 as this was Eugene Laverty’s farewell race to the category and he was one of the riders who fell in the red flag incident suffering a pelvic injury. He was transported to hospital by helicopter for further assessments.

Behind the top four riders Andrea Locatelli (Pata Yamaha WorldSBK Team) beat Alex Lowes to overall fifth place in the championship by two points after finishing fifth in the race.

Scott Redding (BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team) accidentally found a new set-up possibility in the wet and dry race one on Saturday and used it in the shortened final race to finish sixth.

Michael Ruben Rinaldi (Aruba.it Racing – Ducati) had another disappointing PI race but finished fourth in the championship overall.

Philipp Öttl (Team GoEleven Ducati) super-sub Tetsuta Nagashima (HRC Honda) and finally Loris Baz (Bonovo Action BMW) completed the top 10 in the last race of 2022.

Garrett Gerloff (GRT Yamaha) and Xavi Vierge (HRC Honda) crashed out for the race.

In the final Championship points Bautista ended his year with a walloping 601 Razgatlioglu 529 Rea 502 Rinaldi 293 Locatelli 274 and Lowes 272. Top Independent rider of 2022 Axel Bassani (Motocorsa Ducati) was seventh overall with 244 ‘real’ championship points.

Previously oil and gas companies made numerous aggressive tactical or cyclical acquisitions in the wake of a price crash after many distressed assets became available on the cheap. However the 2020 oil price crash that sent oil prices into negative territory has seen energy companies adopt a more restrained strategic and environment-focused approach to cutting M&A deals. According to data released by energy intelligence firm Enverus cited by Reuters U.S. oil and gas dealmaking contracted 65% Y/Y to $12 billion during the second quarter a far cry from $34.8 billion in last year’s corresponding period as high commodity price volatility left buyers and sellers clashing over asset values.

But dealmaking in the U.S. oil patch is now slowly starting to recover with Enverus noting that mergers and acquisitions picked up pace to $16 billion in the third quarter the most this year.

In its quarterly report Enverus notes that the 3rd quarter was the most active quarter in oil and gas so far this year. Still deal value in the first nine months only totaled $36 billion significantly less than the $56 billion recorded in the same period last year.

“Companies are using the cash generated by high commodity prices to pay down debt and reward shareholders rather than seeking out acquisitions. Investors still seem skeptical of public company M&A and are holding management to high standards on deals. Investors want acquisitions priced favorably relative to a buyer’s stock on key return metrics like free cash flow yield to give an immediate uplift to dividends and share buybacks” Andrew Dittmar director of Enverus told Reuters.

Third Quarter M&A Deals

According to Enverus the biggest M&A deal last quarter was EQT Corp’s (NYSE: EQT) $5.2 billion purchase of natural gas producer THQ Appalachia I LLC as well as associated pipeline assets of XcL Midstream. THQ Appalachia which is owned by privately held gas producer Tug Hill Operating.

EQT said the assets acquired include ~90K core net acres offsetting its existing core leasehold in West Virginia producing 800M cfe/day and expected to generate free cash flow at average natural gas prices above ~$1.35/MMBtu over the next five years. The company also doubled its buyback program to $2B and said it is increasing its year-end 2023 debt reduction goal to $4B from $2.5B.

Last year EQT unveiled a plan centered on producing more liquified natural gas by dramatically increasing natural gas drilling in Appalachia and around the country's shale basins as well as pipeline and export terminal capacity which it said would not only boost United States energy security but also help break the global reliance on coal and on countries like Russia and Iran. Its latest acquisition will therefore help the company meet its goal. EQT shares have nearly doubled in the year-to-date.

The second-largest deal last term was German asset manager IKAV’s $4 billion deal for Aera Energy a California oil joint venture between Shell Plc (NYSE: SHEL) and Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM). Operating mostly in central California's San Joaquin Valley Aera is one of California's largest oil producers at 125K bbl/day of oil with 32M cf/day of natural gas generating ~$1B in cash annually. A year ago Reuters reported that Shell wanted to exit the venture and Exxon later joined the effort assisted by financial advisor JPMorgan Chase.

Back in September oil and gas mineral and royalty company Sitio Royalties Corp. (NYSE: STR) is merged with Brigham Minerals (NYSE: MNRL) in an all-stock deal with an aggregate enterprise value of ~$4.8B thus creating one of the largest publicly traded mineral and royalty companies in the United States.

Like the rest of the industry Sitio and Brigham have seen both their top-and bottom-lines expand at a brisk clip on the back of rising oil prices. Combining the two companies will allow the new entity to achieve significant economies of scale and become a leader in the minerals-rights industry.

The merger created a company with complimentary high-quality assets in the Permian Basin and other oil-focused regions. The combined company will have nearly 260K net royalty acres 50.3 net line-of-sight wells operated by a well-capitalized diverse set of E&P companies and a pro-forma Q2 net production of 32.8K boe/day. The deal is also expected to bring in $15 million in annual operational cash cost synergies.

Sitio and Brigham shareholders received 54% and 46% of the combined company respectively on a fully diluted basis. Sitio Royalties recently reported a Q2 net income of $72M on revenues of $88M.

Another notable deal: Diamondback Energy Inc. (NASDAQ: FANG) has entered a deal to acquire all leasehold interest and related assets of FireBird Energy LLC for $775 million in cash and 5.86 million Diamondback shares with the deal valued at $1.6 billion.

Eagle Ford In Focus

The Eagle Ford was the hardest-hit region in the U.S. shale patch and has lagged behind other regions during the ongoing ramp-up in production. But as energy analytics company RBN Energy has noted M&A and drilling have lately been surging in the shale play.

To wit two weeks ago Marathon Oil (NYSE: MRO) announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the Eagle Ford assets of Ensign Natural Resources for $3 billion. Marathon says it expects the deal will be ""immediately and significantly accretive to key financial metrics"" and will drive a 17% increase to 2023 operating cash flow and a 15% increase to free cash flow immediately enhancing shareholder distributions.

In late September Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN) closed on the $1.8 billion acquisition of privately held Eagle Ford producer Validus Energy. According to Devon this acquisition secured a premier acreage position of 42000 net acres (90% working interest) adjacent to Devon’s existing leasehold in the basin. Current production from the acquired assets is ~35000 Boe per day and is expected to increase to an average of 40000 Boe per day over the next year.

Earlier EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG) announced plans to significantly expand its production of natural gas at its Dorado gas play in the Eagle Ford. EOG has estimated that its Dorado assets hold ~21 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of gas at a breakeven cost of less than $1.25/MMBtu.

Drilling activity is also up in the Eagle Ford with the region now home to 71 rigs compared to just 20 a year ago.

Overall the U.S. shale drilling and fracking activity is showing good signs of a rebound with current rig count of 779 a good 223 rigs higher than a year ago. But a full recovery is far from guaranteed: EOG has forecast that overall U.S. oil output will increase by between 700000 and 800000 barrels per day this year. However EOG's top executive has warned that next year's gains will likely trend lower. Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE: PXD) has an even gloomier outlook predicting that U.S. production will only increase around 500000 barrels per day this year one of the lowest forecasts by any analyst and fall even lower than that in the coming year.

Whereas RBN Energy has been touting the ongoing resurgence in the Eagle Ford looking at the bigger picture reveals the rebound is far from established and is yet to measure up to the sharp ramp up in the 2012-2015 period. This applies across the entire U.S. Shale Patch as oil executives limit their expansion and prefer to return excess cash to shareholders.

A week ago the Energy Information Administration (EIA) released its latest Short Term Energy Outlook (STEO) wherein it revised its 2022 and 2023 oil production outlooks. The new projections have elicited mixed reactions across the board with Bloomberg saying “The projection suggests the pace of U.S. shale growth one of the few sources of major new supply in recent year is slowing despite oil prices hovering at around $90 a barrel about double most domestic producers’ breakeven costs. If the trend continues it would deprive the global market of additional barrels to help make up for OPEC+ production cuts and disruption to Russian supplies amid its invasion of Ukraine.”

Recently Norwegian energy intelligence firm Rystad Energy revealed that a mere 44 oil and gas lease rounds will take place globally this year the fewest since the year 2000 and a far cry from a record 105 rounds in 2019. According to the Norwegian energy analyst only two new blocks had been licensed for drilling in the U.S. as of the end of August this year with no new offers for oil and gas leases originating with the Biden administration itself. Indeed the handful of auctions that have gone ahead under Biden or bled into his presidency were decided upon during the presidency of Donald Trump. Meanwhile Rystad has revealed that Brazil Norway and India are the world leaders in terms of new licenses.

We can therefore surmise that a rebound in M&A as well as drilling activity might not necessarily translate into a full shale comeback especially given the new shale playbook of limiting spending high inflation as well as high cost of labor and equipment.

GARYVILLE — Women in Trucking (WIT) announced Marathon Petroleum as one of the top companies for women to work for in transportation. The award is given to companies with a corporate culture that fosters gender diversity competitive compensation and benefits flexible hours professional development opportunities and career advancement opportunities.

“As a female in a male-dominated field you have to overcome many obstacles” said Katie Zalat Marathon Petroleum Transport & Rail (T&R) Operations Director – West. “Advocating for women is something that brings me joy and guides my actions. I’m thankful to work for a company that fosters inclusion and happy we are being recognized as a top company for women to work.”

Marathon’s T&R organization formed partnerships with WIT and the Women in Trucking Foundation. WIT’s broader mission is to encourage the employment of women in the trucking industry promote accomplishments and minimize obstacles. The non-profit organization brings together companies from a range of industries that have the common goal of diversity and inclusion.

“This partnership with Women in Trucking is a great opportunity to help us with some of those actions to improve – in recruiting women in benchmarking and in learning because we have more room to grow” said Zalat. “I am excited for what’s to come and to see more faces like me in T&R as a result of this partnership – behind the wheel of a transport behind a wrench in the maintenance garage or behind a desk working to support our fleets. The sky is the limit!”

Beyond the support of WIT T&R drivers at Marathon have an extensive benefits package. It includes eight weeks of fully paid maternity leave four weeks of fully paid paternity leave adoption assistance tuition reimbursement four-day work weeks a 401k employer match a company pension plan and the opportunity to be home every night.

The Eagle Ford was one of the early shale breakout plays and it now appears to be getting its second wind.

Over the last year the Eagle Ford Shale play has seen a lot of renewed interest in investment as well as M&A activity. Just this November Marathon Oil Company (NYSE:MRO) announced in their quarterly earnings call they had acquired the Eagle Ford assets of privately held Ensign Natural Resources. For a sales price of ~$3.0 bn in a combination of cash and debt instruments MRO got 67000 BOEPD of production 130000 bolt-on acres and 600 new derisked drilling locations. Not a bad deal at ~$23000 per acre on its face but what drove the deal in the Eagle Ford as opposed to other shale plays? Clearly as you look at the deal slide from MRO below the synergies become apparent. The legacy MRO acreage lies in the Volatile Oil and Condensate region of the play. The Ensign acreage continues in the Condensate region and dips down into the Wet Gas region bringing a new horizon to MRO. The Ensign deal brings a double-down focus on the condensate and new horizons in Wet Gas to Marathon. This focus gives us a clue to the question posed in the paragraph above and we will expand on this thinking as we go forward in this piece.

In this article we will review some of the recent Eagle Ford M&A activity over the last year or so. The deals have been coming fast and furious in this play recently and we think some common threads between them are being driven somewhat by takeoff realities coming out of the Permian presently and the lure of the ease of access to Corpus Christie export and LNG facilities.

The rediscovery of the Eagle Ford

The Eagle Ford was one of the early shale breakout plays as companies like EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG) began to ramp up drilling and production from 2010 on. Crude oil and gas production rose rapidly from less than 50K BOEPD in 2008 to over 1.7 mm BOEPD in 2015. A function of a rocketing rig count and cracking the code of shale with fracturing. Things tapered off in the late teens and average production in the Eagle Ford gradually dropped toward 1.0 mm BOEPD a level which it sustained until earlier this year when it rebounded toward 1.2 mm BOEPD.

The Eagle Ford began to shake off its sleepy “end of life” reputation with Penn Virginia and Lonestar Resources merger that gave the combined company — an Eagle Ford pure-play that rebranded as Ranger Oil (NYSE:ROCC) — 140000 net acres in South Texas production averaging more than 40K BOEPD and almost 20 years of inventory.

This was closely followed by Devon Energy’s (NYSE:DVN) acquisition of Validus Energy last year for $1.9 bn. This followed on the heels of spate of smaller deals that included SilverBow Resources’ April 2022 announcement deal to acquire Sundance Energy’s Eagle Ford holdings for $354 million and SandPoint Operating’s holdings in the play for $71 million.

So we can say the Eagle Ford is back but we need to understand the core drivers to know the rest of the story.

EOG and the Dorado discovery

First announced in 2018 low gas prices muted the impact of the massive Dorado find in the Eagle Ford. As noted in an article carried on RBN Energy’s blog in 2021 market conditions shifted in Dorado’s favor.

“EOG Resources’ plan to significantly expand its production of natural gas at its Dorado gas play in the Eagle Ford. EOG which controls about 516000 net acres in the Eagle Ford’s oily areas and another 160000 net acres in the basin’s dry gas window in Webb County has estimated that its Dorado discovery has about 21 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of gas and a breakeven cost of less than $1.25/MMBtu. In February 2022 the company reached an agreement to supply another 420 MMcf/d of gas to Cheniere Energy’s Corpus Christi Liquefaction Stage III project — a seven-train 10-Mtpa expansion of Cheniere’s LNG export terminal in Corpus on top of the 300 MMcf/d EOG had already agreed to provide to the project as its new trains come online.”

EOG does a good job of spelling out the market dynamics in play for Eagle Ford in its November Investor Presentation slide below. Among other things noting the proximity of Dorado to the Corpus Christie export hub pictorially.

Wrapping it up

It looks like the far-sighted producers we have discussed in this article frustrated with the takeaway difficulties in the Permian due to the rising GOR’s made a sound strategic move into the Eagle Ford.

When you combine the significant volumes of Rich Condensate NGL’s and Wet Gas with the proximity to the processing and export market in nearby Corpus Christie the Eagle Ford competes for capital on a par with top-tier acreage in other plays.

Investors wishing to take advantage of the continued growth in the Eagle Ford might do well to have a look at Marathon. The company is trading at 5.5X cash flow or a bit less given the commodity-led sell-off now underway. This is very competitive with other shale players. The current price per flowing barrel is $63K per barrel also very competitive on that metric with some of the big operators going for nearly $100 per barrel.

The adjusted cash flow from Ensign’s 67K boe will add a $1.5 bn of OCF to MRO on an annual basis. Let's say OCF goes to ~$6 bn. In that scenario the OCF multiple drops down to 3.5X and a P/FB basis of $53K per barrel.

To get back to a 5.5X MRO shares need to adjust toward $51-$53 per share. Analysts still need to adjust for this acreage pickup as their top estimate is $42 so I may be out over my skis a hair here. I don't think so though. The math is straightforward.

Bottom-line MRO shares should continue higher from the Ensign acreage pickup. It should also be noted there are other shareholder-friendly actions being taken by the company to dramatically reduce it share count over the next several years.

Energage

Employers have been forced to focus harder than ever to retain and attract talent amid the disruption of the business environment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Top Workplaces celebrates the employers that are getting it right.

The heart of the Top Workplaces program is an employee survey. The 24-question survey collects feedback from those who know organizations the best: the people who work there. Employee feedback is the sole basis for determining which employers make the Top Workplaces list.

This is the 15th year employee survey company Energage has partnered with the Free Press to identify outstanding workplaces in Michigan.

“The employee experience needs to be on the mission-critical list” said Eric Rubino CEO of Energage. “By giving employees a voice and showcasing an authentic culture organizations can attract those job seekers who complement their culture. Culture drives performance.”

For 2022 200 employers made the winners list. Energage invited 6569 organizations to participate and they were eligible provided they had 50 or more employees in the state. Most of the surveying was done between May and July. Surveys went out to 95000 employees in the state and 60151 responded.

The list this year includes 55 employers that were new to the program and five employers that have been named all 15 years of the program: DFCU Financial Ernst & Young LLP Genisys Credit Union Marsh McLennan Agency and Michigan First Credit Union.

Employers were divided based on the number of employees in the region in order to compare feedback of similar-size groups. Organizations that exceeded benchmark scores for each size group made the winners list. Within those groupings organizations are ranked by the aggregate score based on the employee feedback; the more positive the employee responses the higher the score the higher the rank.

Energage also determines special award winners for some employers who have standout scores in certain areas of the survey such as leadership values direction communication meaningfulness and benefits.

Why isn’t a particular company on the list? Perhaps it did not participate had too few employees to qualify or did not score high enough in the survey process. Each year Energage also disqualifies a small number of participants based on irregularities in the employee survey responses including whether employees say they were pressured into answering positively. To nominate a company for next year’s program go to freep.com/nominate.

Ireland’s Josh van der Flier and New Zealand’s Ruahei Demant have been named World Rugby Men’s and Women’s 15s Player of the Year 2022 in partnership with Mastercard respectively at the World Rugby Awards in Monaco on Sunday.

On a night to remember in the iconic Salle des Étoiles a ceremony under the High Patronage of H.S.H. Princess Charlene of Monaco saw the greats of the game past and present and the rugby family celebrate the outstanding achievers of the year.

Van der Flier was named the World Rugby Men’s 15s Player of the Year 2022 the third Irish winner after Keith Wood (2001) and Johnny Sexton (2018). He received the award ahead of three other nominees in Lukhanyo Am (South Africa) Antoine Dupont (France) and Johnny Sexton (Ireland).

New Zealand co-captain Ruahei Demant was at the heart of the Black Ferns journey to Rugby World Cup 2021 winners on home soil a constant threat to opposing defences. She received the award ahead of four other nominees in team-mate Portia Woodman Canada captain Sophie de Goede England flanker Alex Matthews and France scrum-half Laure Sansus.

The recent Rugby World Cup-winning captain Demant said: ""Like most of our team and like many players in New Zealand I come from a very very small place. And to be able to put on the black jersey it was a dream. I never knew about the Black Ferns growing up as a kid. I guess like most women my age women's rugby was never accessible was never something that you kind of aspired to be like because you never had role models like that to look up to. And that was one of the great things about this World Cup it was free to air so everyone could watch it. But people could turn on the TV or go to the games and see people that look like them and so many strong women out there doing amazing incredible things. We had a great bunch of girls who put their heart and soul and body on the line for everyone regardless of whether or not they're playing. So we got the job done. But we also had a great time a lot of fun doing it as well.""

Josh van der Flier said: ""I've been incredibly fortunate to have great teammates and coaches that have really pushed me on as well as my wife and my family supported me a huge amount. I'm lucky to have some very experienced top quality players and especially in my position both in Ireland and in Leinster so I've always felt I've needed to be playing at my best the whole time or I wouldn't be playing so that's certainly driven me on.""

World Rugby Chairman Sir Bill Beaumont said: “On a special night there was so much to celebrate about a remarkable 2022 but for me it was the power of personality that has stood out this year.

“Rugby World Cup 2021 and Rugby World Cup Sevens 2022 were shining examples of rugby’s personality in action. The way that players engage with fans and their accessibility shows that high performance athletes can and should be themselves and have fun. They inspired they moved and they played brilliant rugby.

“As a sport we must harness and celebrate the power of personality if we are to grow to be relevant and attract new audiences. In our award winners we have superb role models but by being accessible on social media the next generation of players and fans can relate to them.

“Congratulations to all our award winners but just as importantly I would like to congratulate everyone who has played their part in getting our sport back up and running since the pandemic – the coaches match officials players mums dads and fans. Without you there is no sport.”

Nine of the winners were selected by the star-studded World Rugby Awards panels while the rugby family had the opportunity to cast their votes for the International Rugby Players Men’s and Women’s Try of the Year categories on World Rugby social platforms.

World Rugby Women’s 15s Player of the Year in partnership with Mastercard – Ruahei Demant (New Zealand)

Described by Wayne Smith as “one of the best leaders I’ve ever had in a team” co-captain Ruahei Demant was the architect of New Zealand’s Rugby World Cup 2021 success driving the team forward as she led by example and brought the game plan to life. A calming presence when the pressure dial ramped up the fly-half was named Mastercard Player of the Match in the final – her 11th test of the year.

Nominees: Sophie de Goede (Canada) Alex Matthews (England) Laure Sansus (France) Portia Woodman (New Zealand)

World Rugby Men’s 15s Player of the Year in partnership with Mastercard – Josh van der Flier (Ireland)

Flanker Josh van der Flier was at the forefront of Ireland’s play throughout the year including in their historic series victory over the All Blacks in New Zealand. The 29-year-old started all 11 of Ireland’s tests in 2022 scoring four tries. A powerful ball carrier in attack Van der Flier was equally impressive on defence with his relentless tackling and tireless work at the breakdown.

World Rugby Coach of the Year – Wayne Smith (New Zealand Women’s 15s)

Appointed as director of rugby six months out from Rugby World Cup 2021 Wayne Smith transformed a New Zealand side that had suffered record losses to England and France last November into world champions for a sixth time following a 34-31 victory over the Red Roses in the final at a sold-out Eden Park. The Professor as Smith is known implemented a change in mindset and playing style that the players embraced and met his challenge to be true to their DNA and play an attacking and unstructured style of rugby.

Nominees: Andy Farrell (Ireland Men’s 15s) Fabien Galthié (France Men’s 15s) Simon Middleton (England Women’s 15s)

World Rugby Women’s 15s Breakthrough Player of the Year in partnership with Tudor – Ruby Tui (New Zealand)

A former World Rugby Women’s Sevens Player of the Year Ruby Tui has made the switch to 15s look easy since making her Black Ferns debut against Australia in June and was one of the stars of Rugby World Cup 2021. The 30-year-old has started 10 of New Zealand’s 12 tests in 2022 scoring eight tries and setting up countless others as she relished the freedom the Black Ferns’ attacking approach afforded their back three.

Nominees: Maud Muir (England) Vitalina Naikore (Fiji) Maiakawanakaulani Roos (New Zealand)

World Rugby Men’s 15s Breakthrough Player of the Year in partnership with Tudor – Ange Capuozzo (Italy)

Ange Capuozzo announced his arrival on the world stage in March with a bang scoring two tries off the bench against Scotland and then made a length-of-the-field break against Wales to set up the try that ended Italy’s seven-year 36-match losing run in the Six Nations. The livewire full-back epitomises the youngsters coming to the fore for Italy under coach Kieran Crowley and scored twice to help the Azzurri beat Australia for the first time a week ago.

Nominees: Henry Arundell (England) Mack Hansen (Ireland) Dan Sheehan (Ireland)

World Rugby Men’s Sevens Player of the Year in partnership with HSBC – Terry Kennedy (Ireland)

The first Ireland player to receive the coveted award Terry Kennedy enjoyed a remarkable year in the green jersey his lightning footwork and speed making the playmaker a constant threat.

Nominees: Nick Malouf (Australia) Kaminieli Rasaku (Fiji) Corey Toole (Australia)

World Rugby Women’s Sevens Player of the Year in partnership with HSBC – Charlotte Caslick (Australia)

Appointed co-captain a few days before her 27th birthday in March Caslick was at the heart of Australia’s unprecedented treble of HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series Commonwealth Games and Rugby World Cup Sevens success in 2022. Caslick scored 31 tries on the 2022 Series and finished as the DHL Impact Player.

Nominees: Maddison Levi (Australia) Amee Leigh Murphy Crowe (Ireland) Faith Nathan (Australia)

A veteran of 15 tests as referee from 1995-2005 Henning’s contribution to the game since hanging up the boots has been his biggest legacy working with match officials in both South Africa and Scotland as well as in competitions such as Super Rugby and the United Rugby Championship. The South African is also known throughout the refereeing world as the ‘law guru’ and the go-to person for any technical law related questions.

Vernon Pugh Award for Distinguished Service – Dr Farah Palmer (New Zealand)

International Rugby Players Men’s Try of the Year – Rodrigo Fernandez (Chile v USA on 9 July)

With 50 minutes on the clock in the first leg of the Americas 2 qualifier in Santiago Chile fly-half Rodrigo Fernandez fielded a box kick just outside his own 22 and side-stepped the onrushing USA defender. Defying the treacherous conditions underfoot caused by the heavy rain Fernandez wasn’t done there and slalomed his way past five more players to score a sublime 75-metre solo try.

Nominees: Lalakai Foketi (Australia v France on 5 November) Chris Harris (Scotland v Italy on 12 March) Edoardo Padovani (Italy v Wales on 19 March) Louis Rees-Zammit (Wales v South Africa on 2 July)

She set off from behind her own try-line stepping her way through the defence before finding fellow winger Abby Dow in support who then raced 65 metres to score.

Nominees: Sylvia Brunt (New Zealand v Wales on 16 October) Emily Chancellor (Australia v England on 30 October) Linda Djougang (Ireland v Wales on 26 March) Nomawethu Mabenge (South Africa v Spain on 12 August)

The winger helped the Springboks win their second Rugby World Cup crown in 2007 and shares the record as top try-scorer in men’s Rugby World Cup history with Jonah Lomu on 15. Off the field Habana has worked with International Rugby Players and the South African players’ association My Players setting a benchmark for what it means to serve the game beyond the pitch – from his fundraising efforts benefitting hard-hit communities to ensuring players across men’s and women’s 15s and sevens at the highest levels have their voices heard.

Whether it's two absolute heavyweight teams of the sport clashing the biggest stars in the sport locking horns neighbouring countries with massive rivalries or even countries at odds because of geopolitics the narratives that surround some of these fixtures are incredibly tantalizing.

Two of the game's greatest in Argentina's Lionel Messi and Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo can't meet before the semifinals and the same can be said of arch rivals Brazil and Argentina if they were to win their respective groups. Italy are absent after failing to qualify but there are still plenty of storylines to look forward to in the early stages.

These are 11 of the most compelling matchups (not featuring Canada since those go without saying!) to look out for from the 48 group stage matchups CTVNews.ca expects to see:

SENEGAL VS. NETHERLANDS

Monday Nov. 21 at 10:45 a.m. on TSN.

This is the first marquee matchup of the tournament featuring the reigning African champions against arguably the best soccer nation to have never won the World Cup.

Netherlands don't come with the serious contender tags of former teams that boasted legends such as Johan Cruyff or Arjen Robben but they are in the midst of building their next great team with rising stars like Cody Gakpo and Xavi Simons alongside established pillars in Virgil van Dijk and Frenkie de Jong.

Senegal have been dealt a massive blow to their hopes at this tournament after it was confirmed that their Bayern Munich superstar Sadio Mane will miss the tournament with a leg injury sustained during Bayern's final match before the World Cup.

What they'll miss in Mane's attacking prowess they will hope to make up for in stellar defending with the luxury of leaning on Chelsea goalkeeper Edouard Mendy as well as central defenders Abdou Diallo of RB Leipzig and Kalidou Koulibaly also of Chelsea.

BRAZIL VS. SERBIA

Thursday Nov. 24 at 1:45 p.m. on CTV/TSN 1 3.

This will be a first look at tournament favourites Brazil and they can expect a serious battle in the form of Serbia.

The latter has been swiftly rising up the ranks in European football and finished top for their qualifying group ahead of Portugal. A huge question mark for them is the status of their two star forwards Juventus' Dusan Vlahovic who has been battling a groin injury and Fulham's Aleksandar Mitrovic struggling with a foot issue.

It should be noted that Vlahovic featured in their final pre-World Cup friendly 5-1 win against Bahrain and scored.

Serbia can be lethal in attack but come with question marks in defence something the likes of Neymar Vinicius Jr. Gabriel Jesus and co. will be keen to pounce on. Get your popcorn.

ENGLAND VS. U.S.A.

Friday Nov. 25 at 1:45 p.m. on CTV/TSN 1 3.

London or New York? Baseball or cricket? Fish and chips or burgers and fries?

The cultural differences are as stark as the gap between these two teams at the moment with England clear favourites when considering the superior depth in talent as well as the confidence of having made the World Cup semis four years ago and the final of Euro 2020.

If there is cause for concern for England it's the fact that their recent form has been far from ideal including a 4-0 hammering at the hands of Hungary this past June.

The U.S. had a mediocre qualifying campaign finishing third behind Canada and Mexico but will be depending on the good ole American way that saw them snatch a 1-1 draw when the two sides met on this grand stage in 2010.

FRANCE VS. DENMARK

Saturday Nov. 26 at 10:45 a.m. on CTV/TSN.

France are the defending champions but Denmark seem to have the edge in terms of momentum.

Kylian Mbappe is one of the biggest names in the game but the heart of their midfield in N'golo Kante and Paul Pogba and reigning Ballon d'Or winner (annual best player in the world award) Karim Benzema are all missing the tournament due to injury. To make matters worse PSG defender Presnel Kimpembe has also been ruled out due to injury as has forward Christopher Nkunku.

Les Bleus crashed out of Euro 2020 with a shock Round of 16 penalty shootout defeat to Switzerland despite leading 3-1 going into the 80th minute. If you're looking at trends the defending champion has been knocked out in the group stage of the following World Cup in the last three editions and four of the last five (France Italy Spain Germany).

Denmark meanwhile have beaten France 2-1 in Paris and 2-0 in Copenhagen in their two most recent meetings reached the semifinals of Euro 2020 and scorched an albeit comfortable World Cup qualifying group.

Christian Eriksen has made a heartwarming return to the sport after suffering a cardiac arrest during a Euro 2020 match and he leads a very strong midfield while the defence looks equally as strong and organized. They will also be doing their best to send a message for the atrocities happening off the pitch.

The stakes for this match are particularly high as well as first place will likely mean avoiding Messi's Argentina in the Round of 16.

SPAIN VS. GERMANY

Sunday Nov. 27 at 1:45 p.m. on TSN.

A true heavyweight clash. As soon as the tournament draw was revealed fans across the globe salivated at the prospect of seeing these two sides go toe-to-toe in the group stage and the time is almost here.

Spain are long removed from their dynastic run of sandwiching a 2010 World Cup title in between European Championship victories in 2008 and 2012 but look a team on the rise again with young stars such as Pedri Gavi and Ansu Fati all of whom play for Barcelona.

Germany also look a side in a bit of an in between phase after a group phase exit in 2018 coupled with a Round of 16 exit at the Euros. Mainstays in Manuel Neuer and Thomas Muller are still around but this team's success will revolve around Bayern Munich's Serge Nabry Chelsea's Kai Havertz and Borussia Monchengladbach's Jonas Hofmann who may be the most in-form German heading into the tournament.

PORTUGAL VS. URUGUAY

Monday Nov. 28 at 1:45 p.m. on TSN

Turning 38 in February this is Ronaldo's last chance at winning the World Cup. It was Uruguay that ended his dream in 2018 and that should bring some added spice to an already tasty encounter.

As one of the all-time greats starts to fade into the sunset Portugal has plenty of talent to give this World Cup pursuit a serious go but it's head coach Fernando Santos' tactics that seem a bit too defensive for the players at his disposal.

While it would be sacrilegous to Portuguese ears there is a question to be asked if Ronaldo should be starting considering his lack of minutes at Manchester United and recent form. United teammate Bruno Fernandes seems to play his best when Ronaldo isn't on the pitch while Rafael Leao and Joao Felix are probably ready to take over the mantle.

Uruguay also have a couple of stars on their last legs in Luis Suarez and Edinson Cavani but they also have a new generation in Darwin Nunez and Federico Valverde ushering in a new era. The two-time World Cup champions are sure to make it a difficult day for Ronaldo and second place in this group likely means a clash with favourites Brazil.

U.S.A. VS. IRAN

Tuesday Nov. 29 at 12:45 p.m. on TSN 2.

There are certainly quality players in Chelsea midfielder Christian Pulisic and FC Porto forward Mehdi Taremi to look out for but this is one of those fixtures where soccer will be accompanied by the backdrop of the politics between the two countries.

Iran and the U.S. haven't had formal diplomatic relations since 1980 and reached an all-time low during Donald Trump's presidency. Will we see any of that political tension translate into hostility on the pitch? Tune in to find out.

ENGLAND VS. WALES

Tuesday Nov. 29 at 12:45 p.m. on TSN 1 3 4 5.

May as well call it rivalry day because at the very same time as Iran vs. U.S.A. Wales will look to show they are no little brother to neighbours England.

Welsh hopes will wrest on Gareth Bale who despite being in decline at club level still seems to find his Superman cape for country and will be a major point of focus for England's defence.

England have won their last six meetings including a 3-0 win in their most recent battle on Oct. 8 2020.

BELGIUM VS. CROATIA

Thursday Dec. 1 at 9:45 a.m. on TSN 2.

There will already be added incentive for Canadians to keep tabs on this fixture if the men in red and white can secure at least a point from its first two fixtures but there will be plenty of reasons to watch this match regardless.

Real Madrid's Luka Modric and Manchester City's Kevin De Bruyne are two of the best midfielders going in world soccer today Belgium are the No. 2 ranked side in the world while Croatia are last World Cup's finalists and the team that finishes first in the group will possibly be looking at a relatively lighter path to the final.

GHANA VS. URUGUAY

Friday Dec. 2 at 9:45 a.m. on TSN 2.

The last time these two sides met the world bore witness to one of the most dramatic finishes in World Cup history.

Facing each other in the 2010 quarter-finals in the first-ever World Cup held in Africa the sides split two long range strikes for the only goals of the first 90 minutes Ghana seemed destined for victory in the final minute of extra time when a scramble in front of the Uruguay goal saw the ball destined for the back of the net until Luis Suarez raised his hands and batted the ball away volleyball style.

Referee Olegario Benquerenca spotted the infringement and awarded Ghana a penalty while also giving Suarez a red card. Asamoah Gyan had previously scored the two penalties he had taken in the tournament but blasted this one against the crossbar and out with what was the final kick of the match.

A penalty shootout followed and Ghana heartbreakingly crashed out. While no players from that team remain in the current Ghana squad Uruguay have a few members from that 2010 squad including Suarez ready to stir up those unpleasant memories.

SERBIA VS. SWITZERLAND

Friday Dec. 2 at 1:45 p.m. on TSN 2.

The final match of the entire group stage is set to be a thriller with these two sides barring a surprise from Cameroon likely facing a must-win situation to advance out of a Group G that includes Brazil.

It will be a showcase of defence vs. attack as Serbia's potent offence will look to crack through a Swiss defence that can be stubborn with goalkeeper Yann Sommer leading the way after inspiring them to the quarter-finals of Euro 2020.

Serbia qualified for three of the last four World Cups but failed to advance past the group stage each time while Switzerland has reached the Round of 16 in three of the last four World Cups."
MKC,McCormick & Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL3RydW1wLWJhY2tlZC1zZW5hdGUtaG9wZWZ1bC1kYXZlLW1jY29ybWljay1oYXMtZXh0ZW5zaXZlLWRlZXAtc3RhdGUtdGllc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trump-Backed Senate Hopeful Dave McCormick Has Extensive 'Deep State' Ties,"As he runs for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania Dave McCormick’s claims to his “home state” have been a source of contention on the campaign trail: the Republican hedge fund titan spent much of his youth in Pennsylvania but has lived out most of his recent adult and professional days in Connecticut.

While the extent of McCormick’s ties to his “home state” are cloudy his ties to another state—the “deep state”—seem far more clear.

Despite his claims to the MAGA movement McCormick is steeped in the nexus of government intelligence and big business that Donald Trump and his acolytes ambiguously refer to as “the deep state.”

Those connections range from colleagues to boards to corporate investments with additional ties to notorious surveillance systems and an internal monitoring project at McCormick’s firm—the legendary hedge fund Bridgewater Associates—that was directly modeled after the Chinese Communist Party’s autocratic surveillance state.

And in the mind of Trump who is McCormick’s most crucial political ally some of those ties would be about as problematic as a MAGA Republican can get—such as for instance former FBI Director James Comey.

Comey it turns out accepted a senior role at Bridgewater the year after McCormick signed on as the fund’s president. As general counsel Comey oversaw an internal security program whose invasive and sometimes demeaning methods of surveillance and interrogation earned him a reputation as Bridgewater’s “in-house inquisitor.”

Aside from Comey the most prominent of McCormick’s “deep state” affiliations is his recent three-year run as a paid trustee of the secretive government-backed investment group In-Q-Tel—quite literally the Central Intelligence Agency’s very own venture capital firm.

McCormick’s role at In-Q-Tel appears on his candidate financial disclosures where he listed the entity’s name as “IQT.” Tax filings from In-Q-Tel which is registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit show that McCormick joined as a trustee in March 2018 and left in 2022 as he pursued his first Senate campaign. He collected an annual $35000 salary logging five hours of work a week according to the tax records and his election bid has since seen hundreds of thousands of dollars in support from executives tied to IQT and its investments.

For McCormick his deep state connections embody the larger political contradictions he’s already been forced to reconcile as a corporate Republican seeking office in the quasi-populist era of Trump.

That tortured balancing act failed two years ago. In the 2022 GOP primary in Pennsylvania the lifelong moderate failed to land Trump’s endorsement—losing that honor and subsequently the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz.

While McCormick got the coveted Trump endorsement this year—though there weren’t any other viable Republicans running in the primary—the dissonance is starker than ever.

Today the MAGA wing of the Republican Party finds itself fully enthralled with conspiracy theories about the intelligence community which Trump and his allies have for years cast as public enemy No. 1. Trump is vowing retribution as a key 2024 campaign plank.

Given that McCormick’s challenge to Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) will be one of the most contentious races of the 2024 cycle the hedge funder turned true MAGA believer may have to work harder than expected to scrub his deep establishment ties in order to appeal to his new base.

A former colleague of McCormick’s at Bridgewater told The Daily Beast that McCormick was “an honorable man” a “stand-up guy” and an “independent” and “brilliant leader.” But the colleague also put his finger on the Trump issue calling it a “sad reality” that McCormick will have to cave to the whims of the former president.

“He knows that if he wins he won’t get to do what he thinks is right” the person said. “He has his own money and he won’t be so susceptible to outside pressures financially. But he’s still going to have to kiss the ring and that’s unfortunate.”

McCormick’s campaign did not respond to detailed questions for this article.

It’s not clear if Trump knew about McCormick’s work with the U.S. intelligence community including the CIA and Comey. But as it turns out the deep state overlaps in myriad ways with McCormick’s 13-year tenure as a top executive at Bridgewater.

In 2010—the year after McCormick left George W. Bush’s Treasury Department to sign on as Bridgewater’s president—Bridgewater hired Comey who would later come to embody the darkest of Trump’s paranoiac accusations about federal agents.

Bridgewater brought Comey on officially as head of security and general counsel. In practice however Comey’s role more closely resembled that of an “in-house inquisitor” over the first iteration of the firm’s oppressive internal employee monitoring program which would later come to be called “The Politburo.”

Before he led the FBI unleashed a bombshell on Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign and got fired by Trump Comey reportedly raked in $7 million per year at Bridgewater. His task was to keep employees in line with the goals of what firm founder Ray Dalio called “radical transparency.” Those efforts included constant surveillance—including recorded meetings and videotaped internal “trials” of employees—with Dalio telling Bridgewater staff that Comey was “like a godfather adjudicating it all.”

The taped meetings were “just the tip of the surveillance ecosystem” at Bridgewater Vanity Fair reported in its profile of Comey’s time with the firm.

“A slew of ex FBI agents staffed the security team. Not only did cameras cover seemingly every inch of the property but they seemed to be watched in real time. Staffers who left their desks even briefly would return to sticky notes left on their computer monitors admonishing them for failing to put up a screen saver” Vanity Fair reported.

Comey would go through employee cellphone and computer records and was apparently so intrusive that he embarrassed one executive into resigning.

But when Comey’s security posse only turned up “little evidence of actual offending behavior to snuff out they created their own” according to Vanity Fair.

In one instance the report said Comey left an executive’s binder clearly labeled and unattended in Bridgewater offices. He then watched as surveillance cameras captured a low-ranking employee discovering the binder and going through it. Comey put the employee on trial and fired him with the approval of Dalio.

Comey however eventually found himself repelled by Dalio’s extremes resigning after two years. (This month Comey happens to be publishing a murder mystery novel that takes place inside a fictionalized version of Bridgewater.)

Dalio however only ramped things up implementing more and more intrusive policies to fully enact his “radical transparency” dogma.

That program it turns out was literally modeled on the Chinese Communist Party’s social surveillance program which Dalio openly admired. He even named the project after the CCP’s own “Politburo” and compared it favorably to “Big Brother” in a 60 Minutes interview.

China of course is another area where McCormick is against the prevailing GOP winds as Bridgewater’s internal culture “reflects aspects of Chinese political ideology” and invested heavily in the region—after McCormick took over as co-CEO in 2017 the fund’s Chinese investments skyrocketed.

The “Politburo” staffed up with officials from the National Security Agency and the CIA. But Bridgewater workers found it “intimidating” and “humiliating” and so intrusive that in 2017 one whistleblower filed a human rights complaint with the state of Connecticut where the fund is headquartered which was covered at the time in The New York Times.

As detailed in a recent book about Dalio titled The Fund the Politburo essentially pitted its employees against each other assigning roles like “auditors” and “overseers” and recording practically every moment of activity—all in pursuit of Dalio’s core “radical transparency” philosophy.

While the system repelled many employees—including Comey and one-time CEO Jon Rubinstein who both left after disagreements with Dalio—McCormick stayed aboard got a promotion and publicly defended Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Rubinstein quit after a “firing squad” meeting that McCormick personally sat in on according to the book where Rubinstein made the case that Dalio’s increasingly authoritarian policies were creating a “climate of fear.” When McCormick one of a handful of senior executives in the room was personally asked if he agreed with Rubinstein’s take he said he did not according to the book.

McCormick has subsequently defended Dalio. In 2020 when McCormick was asked if he took issue with a fundamental contradiction at the core of the monitoring program—“radical transparency” within the company but kept secret from outside scrutiny—he replied that he “doesn’t think it’s inconsistent at all.”

“Ray has always said this: Radical transparency is not total transparency. There are certain things that we’re not transparent about and consciously so. Personnel and salary discussions for example” McCormick said.

Shortly after rising to co-CEO McCormick joined the board at IQT.

The venture capital nonprofit which former CIA Director George Tenet founded in 1999 has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds to hundreds of technology firms and startups some of which are still secret.

Today IQT oversees more than $1 billion in assets and even has its own special-purpose acquisition company. Though the group keeps a low profile IQT maintains a close relationship with government intelligence and security divisions and runs “almost all investment decisions” by the CIA.

Many IQT investments seek to cultivate the private development of surveillance technology that could one day benefit the intelligence community and some of them overlap with both Bridgewater and McCormick.

One of those companies is Palantir a tech firm closely tied to right-wing financier Peter Thiel whose sprawling government work has made it a lightning rod for civil rights controversy—and whose fate was “rescued” by IQT’s investment.

Bridgewater itself helped fund Palantir and incorporated Palantir technology to advance its own investments as well as to help monitor Bridgewater employees in the fund’s pursuit of Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Palantir executives have contributed thousands of dollars to McCormick’s 2024 campaign.

Additionally one of IQT’s current trustees Howard Fox who also served on the board with McCormick has put serious money—more than $150000—behind McCormick’s candidacy in both 2022 and this cycle.

The same is true of other McCormick supporters like the CEO of Tenable an IQT-backed tech firm which announced its public stock offering shortly after McCormick joined the board.

And while it’s true that McCormick brings his own money to the table that hasn’t stopped Bridgewater donors from chipping in. In all Bridgewater employees mostly executives have contributed about $100000 to McCormick’s political aspirations with current president Kyle Delaney throwing $50000 to a 2022 super PAC backing his old colleague.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcmdhbmZoLm5ldC9vYml0dWFyeS9qb3NoLW1jY29ybWlja9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary | Josh McCormick of Huntington West Virginia,"LEWISBURG WV - Joshua Howard McCormick 38 of Huntington WV formerly of Lewisburg WV passed away May 3 2024 at home.

Why it matters: Pennsylvania's race between McCormick and Democratic incumbent Bob Casey Jr. could determine which party controls the Senate next year — and is a prime opportunity for Republicans to gain a seat.

Driving the news: Keystone Renewal PAC's first ad focuses on McCormick's time at West Point and his earning a Bronze Star while serving in the Gulf War.

The ad promoting the former hedge fund CEO will run for four weeks beginning on cable broadcast and digital platforms in the Pittsburgh Scranton Harrisburg and Johnstown markets.

McMormick's campaign aims to make his military service a constant theme in his campaign against Casey who's seeking his fourth six-year term in the Senate.

McCormick is making his second run for the Senate. In 2022 he lost in the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz who went on to lose to Democrat John Fetterman in the midterm election.

Bob Casey goes after Dave McCormick on Connecticut residency,"PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — The race between Sen. Bob Casey and his Republican challenger former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick is expected to be one of the most hotly contested elections in the nation.

Casey's name is synonymous with Pennsylvania especially Scranton. But it didn't take Casey long to label McCormick a Connecticut Yankee for living outside the state for many years.

""He hasn't told the truth about where he lives"" Casey said. ""He lives in Connecticut. He hasn't been truthful about that. So you have an out-of-state candidate who's being supported by out-of-state billionaires.""

KDKA-TV's Jon Delano: ""Where do you live?""

McCormick: ""I live in Pennsylvania. I live in Pittsburgh.""

Just before his run for U.S. Senate in 2022 McCormick who is divorced and remarried sold his home in Connecticut bought a home in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill and rented another home in Connecticut.

""My youngest daughter lives with her mother in Connecticut so I periodically go back to Connecticut to see my daughter. Being a good dad is even more important than being a good senator"" McCormick said.

McCormick grew up in Bloomsburg where his father was president of Bloomsburg University. But he also lived outside the state working first for the Bush administration and then as president and CEO of Bridgewater Associates a Connecticut-based multi-billion dollar hedge fund from 2009 to 2022.

McCormick sees the Connecticut residency issue as a distraction from Casey's record.

""When you have the results that Bob Casey has with inflation border crime the war on oil and gas the world falling apart what do you do? Well you try to make it about something that is unrelated in your opponent"" McCormick said.

But Casey says McCormick's long out-of-state residency coupled with his work for a hedge fund associated with multi-millionaires demonstrates who he will represent in the Senate.

""He hadn't voted in Pennsylvania in about 16 years. So I think that's going to be an issue. But I think ultimately it's going to be about whose side you are on"" Casey said.

Casey sees himself as representing hard-working middle-class Pennsylvanians while McCormick argues that Casey has failed to deliver any results.

McCormick criticizes Casey for supporting President Biden's infrastructure bill CHIPS and Science Act the Inflation Reduction Act and other bills.

""Bob Casey has been a 98% vote for Joe Biden"" McCormick said.

Casey sees himself as a soft-spoken doer who gets things done for this part of Pennsylvania.

""The bridge investment alone is about a quarter of a billion dollars just for bridges"" Casey said. ""But there's investments for K-12 education investments for communities all across the board whether it was in the infrastructure bill the American Rescue legislation or otherwise. So we've been able to get resources to communities to try to lift them up but we still have work to do so I want to keep delivering.""

The two candidates disagree on other issues as well like abortion. Casey who is personally pro-life supports the Women's Health Protection Act to codify abortion rights nationwide while McCormick opposes abortion with limited exceptions and opposes all federal legislation on the subject.

""Our states should decide"" McCormick said. ""Pennsylvania should decide as it has. My belief is that we shouldn't have bans. We shouldn't have national legislation.""

Casey says McCormick's work at the hedge fund to promote China will be another issue.

""When China cheats Pennsylvania loses jobs. So he's helped to fuel that rise of China and I think that's going to be a major issue in the campaign"" Casey said.

Delano: ""So you're suggesting he's soft on China?""

Casey: ""I don't think there's any question about it compared to what I've been doing.""

""I've been in business"" McCormick said. ""Yes my business did 2% of its business in China. I know what it's like to negotiate against the Chinese in the government and in business. There is no one better equipped to deal with the challenge of China than me.""

These are just a few of many issues on which Casey and McCormick disagree. Given the millions both campaigns will spend expect to hear a lot more in the months ahead."

Burger King's Whopper: We Found Out What Burger Is Better According To Presentation ...,"In terms of presentation here are our ratings:

CHRIS: They were both aesthetically pleasing. The Big Mac was neatly stacked and the lettuce/sauce spillage was just from being picked up and held. As for the Whopper from the side it honestly looked like a cartoon burger with all of the color and that melty cheese. That's something I'd see animated and wish it were an IRL burger. Again both killed it.

BURGER KING: 4.8/5 MCDONALD'S's: 4.6/5



KRISTA: Look both of these in my opinion were too sauce heavy. That makes for a soggy burger and it makes me think you need a lot of sauce to cover up the actual taste of the food...just sayin'. When it comes to size bigger isn't always better — especially when it's fast food. The Whopper looked less appealing to me because it was SO MUCH. In a way it was too big and too overdone. Even the tomatoes felt too big lol. Comparing it to the Big Mac I liked that it had layers and seemed more like a simple burger to eat. ALSO the Big Mac comes in a nice cardboard box that keeps it in-tact and the Whopper just comes wrapped like a plain ol' burger.

Chewing Gum Sub-Industries

Different sub-industries within the larger gum industry however have different dynamics.

The Research and Markets report further went on to say that sugary chewing gums are seeing a relative decline in demand which is being offset by healthier sugar-free gums. Mordor Intelligence forecasts a CAGR of 7.3% for the sugar-free chewing gum sub-industry for the 2022-2027 period with Europe being its largest market and Asia-Pacific being the fastest growing market.

Overall functional chewing gums — gums that serve a beneficial purpose — are rising higher in demand than non-functional gums as consumers become more health-conscious. The tooth-whitening gum industry holds more than 50% share of the functional gum market according to the Research and Markets report.

David Rodriguez Munoz Detroit Free Press

The year was 2011. The location was the kitchen at Linda Cummings’ northwest Detroit home. And Cummings’ 11-year-old son and 9-year-old daughter had an important announcement to make.

“Mom we want to go to U of M” the 59-year-old Cummings said recently in her best ""kid’s voice"" as she replayed the moment when her son Ricardo and her daughter Alia made it clear that their hearts and minds were set on attending the University of Michigan — even before they had completed elementary school.

To Cummings’ best recollection the statement was repeated at least two more times by her son and daughter in unison. Afterward Cummings said there was no doubt in her mind that both of her children would find their way to the University of Michigan campus in Ann Arbor when their time for college came. But first there was work that she needed to do to make her children’s dream a reality.

“It’s a mother’s job to protect her children and keep them healthy and strong so they can pursue their dreams” said Cummings who was born in Albion and moved to Detroit in 1981 which coincided with her admission to Mercy College of Detroit. “For my children to attend the University of Michigan they were going to need to earn scholarships. And to make sure that happened I had to keep them focused.”

For Cummings keeping her children focused by any means necessary also involved a dramatic change in the way she earned a living. For 25 years she had worked in positions — including more than 10 years within the Wayne County Prosecutor’s Office — where she advocated for children and families. However Cummings found a need to shift gears and she used her undergraduate degree in education to become a substitute teacher. What she lost in terms of dollars in her paycheck Cummings said she and her children gained more from the added time she was able to spend with them throughout the remainder of their pre-college schooling.

On May 11 2019 Linda Cummings (left) and Ricardo Cummings (far right) celebrated Alia Cummings’ participation in the 40th annual WXYZ “Brightest And Best” which honors some of the highest achieving graduating seniors from area schools. The event took place outside the WXYZ-TV Broadcast House in Southfield. A 2019 graduate of Detroit Edison Public School Academy Alia Cummings is on track to graduate from the University of Michigan in December 2023. In 2021 Ricardo Cummings the son of Linda Cummings and the older brother of Alia graduated from the University of Michigan and is now a portfolio planning leader for Procter & Gamble in Cincinnati.

“In life sometimes you have to make choices and make changes and parenting is all about being consistent” said Cummings who also holds a master’s degree in counseling. “It’s important for parents to be around their kids and I needed that extra time to provide stability and keep my children focused on their goals.”

The extra time described by Cummings turned out to be time well spent and her children are the proof. In 2021 Ricardo Cummings graduated from the University of Michigan’s College of Engineering with a bachelor’s degree in industrial and operations engineering. The Michigan Wolverine now calls the Buckeye state home while working for Cincinnati-headquartered Procter & Gamble as a portfolio planning leader. And Alia Cummings is on track to earn her own University of Michigan degree a bachelor’s degree in material science and engineering which is scheduled to happen in December 2023.

“My children have been an inspiration to me because I see how they have continued to push” said Linda Cummings who pointed out that her children did more not less during the earlier stages of the pandemic to reach where they are currently in life.

When Linda Cummings talks about her children the prideful tone in her voice cannot be denied. The words that come out of her mouth are equally revealing as she often substitutes her children’s names with the descriptions: “best son ever” and “best daughter ever.” And just as the kitchen in her Bagley community home was once a place where Linda Cummings regularly learned about the exciting choices her children were making about their futures today another kitchen located within the North Rosedale Park Community House (18445 Scarsdale) keeps her connected to her children because within that kitchen Linda Cummings creates the sweet treats sold by her two-year-old company Soul Amazing LLC.

“I had to start my business because I asked myself: ‘What do I have to leave my children?’ ” explained Linda Cummings whose company specializes in sweet potato pies in a variety of sizes and 7-ounce sweet potato bites sold as six or 12-packs.

The sweet potato pies and bites can be purchased with or without pecans on top. And when Linda Cummings further explains her decision to launch her company during a peak period of a global pandemic she goes back to words spoken at her home kitchen table long before her children left for college.

“My children used to always say: ‘Mom you cook with love and one day you’re going to be in a restaurant because you cook with love' ” Linda Cummings who used quarantine periods during 2020 to further sharpen her baking skills recalls. “Whatever I cooked to my children it was the best ever. They didn’t know that we were in a struggle or where the food came from but it was still the best to them. I still hear their words and they give me purpose beyond measure and it has allowed me to continue to dream and push.”

The youngest of six children born to Willie Frank Smith Jr. and Frankie Bell Smith who helped support the family as a cook at Albion College Linda Cummings only knows her mother through pictures because she died when Linda was just a year old. However Cummings received motherly guidance throughout her childhood from her oldest sister Annie Lois Smith. And in recent years when she desperately needed direction with the launch of her business during a most challenging time Cummings said her church Global Empowerment Ministries (17910 Van Dyke) and Pastor Art Cartwright provided the knowledge she needed from a “Biblical standpoint” including information about incorporating a business certification product development packaging pricing and much more. Cummings also expressed her deep appreciation for a very timely $50 gift from Mother Cartwright who gave Cummings instructions to pay the gift forward which led to her giving out free samples of her pies that eventually produced future opportunities.

Because of the many helping hands that have touched her throughout her life including Linda Cummings’ adopted grandmother Claudia Clark who lived to be 105 years old and provided love and guidance to Cummings until Clark’s last days Cummings says her business must have a community mission.

“My goal is to help stop the tears in families by providing employment to single moms and dads” said Cummings whose pies and bites can be purchased at the Meijer Rivertown Market (1475 E. Jefferson) and other area locations and even as far away as the Meijer Capital City Market in Lansing. “I also want to open up a trade center for teenagers in the 10th through 12th grades. Everyone is not for college but the trade center would provide opportunities for teenagers to create their own business or expand with someone else. We don’t have to tell our young people what to do but we can give them options.”

This year will mark the first time that Soul Amazing products will be available in stores during the extended holiday season. And while that is a milestone for the business for Cummings’ children the holidays simply provide the best chance to celebrate mom.

“I am thankful for my mom for so many reasons” Ricardo Cummings said on Wednesday from Cincinnati. “She inspires me on a daily basis to follow my dreams and make the biggest impact possible through interactions with people. Since I was young she’s always baked sweet potato pies. It’s been her staple for many years for birthdays holidays and events. I don’t get to have them as often since I moved to Cincinnati for work but I am looking forward to getting the opportunity to eat her pies this upcoming Thanksgiving. It’s one of my yearly highlights. I appreciate the work she does and wish her success as she follows her passions.”

Ricardo’s words were echoed by his sister who also provided a confession about her feelings surrounding sweet potato pie in general.

“I will legit not eat anyone’s else’s sweet potato pie because I don’t like it but I love my mom’s” said Alia Cummings who shared her thoughts Wednesday from Ann Arbor just hours before her mother headed to the North Rosedale Park Community House kitchen for some late-night baking. “You can feel a sense of joy from the very first bite with one of my mom’s pies. And I believe you feel that because of the blood sweat tears and caring she puts into every pie she bakes. There’s soulfulness behind every pie.”

Simply sign up to the Chinese business & finance myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.

The world’s biggest asset management state pension and sovereign wealth funds are passively invested in companies which have allegedly been involved in the repression of Uyghur Muslims in north-west China’s Xinjiang region a new report says.

According to Hong Kong Watch a UK-based research group and the Helena Kennedy Centre for International Justice at Sheffield Hallam University three major stock indices provided by index publisher MSCI include at least 13 companies which have allegedly used forced labour or have profited from China’s construction of internment camps in Xinjiang and its surveillance apparatus in recent years.

The report which will be published on Monday shows how leading asset managers including BlackRock HSBC UBS and Deutsche Bank are exposed to index funds that include companies accused of being complicit in rights violations.

Hong Kong Watch said pension funds from Canada the US and UK — including the Church of England’s fund — as well as Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund and the New Zealand Superannuation Fund are also exposed. However the Church of England insisted its pension fund does not use the MSCI emerging markets tracker for its passive index.*

“Major institutional investors are funding companies known to be involved and benefiting from the crisis in the Uyghur region” the report said. “It is vital that firms take action and actually live up to the ethical commitments that they have made under ESG frameworks and through signing international human rights compacts.”

China has come under renewed international pressure over its treatment of Xinjiang’s Uyghur population which numbers about 12mn in a region of 25mn. In a landmark report in September the UN’s top human rights body said China’s actions could constitute “crimes against humanity”. Beijing has denied the allegations as a “fabricated lie”.

The Hong Kong Watch report focuses on companies included in the MSCI indices which have been identified in academic research and news reports as allegedly complicit in the human rights violations.

The report lists seven companies that allegedly used Uyghur workers obtained through state-sponsored transfers a form of forced labour. They include electronics group Avary Holding Foxconn the main manufacturer of Apple iPhones in China and Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology China’s biggest wind turbine maker.

It also lists six groups allegedly involved in the construction of prisons internment camps and surveillance infrastructure in Xinjiang including video surveillance maker Dahua Technology speech recognition developer iFlytek biotech group BGI Genomics and telecoms company ZTE.

Twelve of the companies are in the MSCI China index 13 are in the MSCI Emerging Markets index and four are in the MSCI All Country World index.

MSCI told the Financial Times that the only “filters for inclusion” in its global indices are “accessibility and investability”.

“If an international investor is able to access the stock market and invest in companies in the market then the market and those companies are eligible for inclusion in our market indices” the company said.

MSCI added that it has various ESG-focused indices for which its researchers conduct “daily monitoring of controversies and other governance issues”.

Foxconn and Avary denied all allegations of forced labour. Each company pointed to independent audits and investigations in the past two years that found no evidence of labour abuse.

Dahua and BGI two of the groups which allegedly supported the surveillance apparatus have also rejected allegations of human rights abuses. The remaining nine companies identified by Hong Kong Watch did not respond to a request for comment.

Morningstar data show that the stocks flagged in the new report are included in 16 dollar- and sterling-denominated funds benchmarked against the three MSCI stock indices in question representing a combined market value of more than $106bn.

Among the biggest benefits of inclusion in such benchmarks are the passive inflows prompted by these and other stock indices which can provide a substantial boost to valuation by driving demand for the underlying equities.

Taken together the market capitalisation of the 13 listings named in Hong Kong Watch’s report comes to roughly $158bn according to FT calculations based on Bloomberg data.

*This article has been amended to make clear that the Church of England denies its pension fund uses the MSCI emerging markets tracker for its passive index.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vZWNvbm9teS8yMDIyLzExLzIwL3FhdGFyLWdlYXJpbmctdXAtZm9yLWZpZmEtd29ybGQtY3VwLWVxdWl0eS1tYXJrZXQtYm9vbdIBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vYW1wL2Vjb25vbXkvMjAyMi8xMS8yMC9xYXRhci1nZWFyaW5nLXVwLWZvci1maWZhLXdvcmxkLWN1cC1lcXVpdHktbWFya2V0LWJvb20?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Qatar gears up for FIFA World Cup equity market boom,"Historically equity markets of FIFA World Cup hosts have outperformed peers. Qatar is set to do the same.

Doha Qatar – Qatar is gearing up for a FIFA World Cup equity market boom as the country’s stock exchange is all set to benefit from the upcoming colossal event.

With more than $4bn of foreign inflows in the first 10 months of this year alone equity market experts say that Qatar’s stock market like most previous World Cup host markets has outperformed peers in the run-up to the mega contest and is expected to continue along similar lines in the year after the tournament.

Historically the average MSCI country stock market index of host nations of the previous seven World Cups excluding outlier Brazil grew by 21.8 percent in the year leading up to the World Cup and by 13.4 percent in the year after compared with the MSCI World Index average growth of 4.3 percent and 9.5 percent respectively.

Brazil’s MSCI Index was an outlier and declined by 34 percent in the year after the final match in 2014. That drop was on account of domestic economic conditions a political crisis and high inflation prevalent at the time analysts say.

However 2022 is proving to be an extraordinary year as stock markets bear the brunt of interest rate hikes by central banks attempting to fight inflation and turning off the supply of easy money that was started during the pandemic. Qatar’s stock market has not been immune to either.

The QSE Index which measures the 20 largest and most liquid stocks on the Qatar Stock Exchange (QSE) appreciated as much as 24.7 percent from the start of 2022 to April 11 2022 but then declined to almost flattish territory in late June and was again up by 12.1 percent year to date on September 5 2022.

While that may not seem like a lot it still puts the QSE Index as a relative outperformer among most major regional and global markets in the first eight months of this year as per the latest data available.

“Given that the country is preparing for the World Cup for more than a decade to focus on a short period of stock performance won’t be a fair reflection” said Akber Khan senior director of asset management at Doha-based Al Rayan Investment.

“If we look at the performance of Qatar’s stock market in the last five years when preparations related to the World Cup accelerated in terms of the pace of work Qatar’s stock market is up more than 50 percent” Khan added.

During that period the broad index of emerging market equity is down more than 20 percent while the global equity indices are up about 15 to 18 percent he pointed out.

‘Show off a developed Qatar’

Since 2010 when Qatar won the rights to host the World Cup the state has spent more than $300bn to upgrade its infrastructure including the Doha Metro thousands of kilometres of local roads and highways a new port a new airport and even a new city as well as boosting its oil and gas facilities.

“This is really pulling forward a lot of medium-term development projects the state had and in many cases a lot of projects that would have been completed over a decade are already finished to show off a developed Qatar during the World Cup” Khan added.

The World Cup gains on the QSE are expected to carry into the next year as well primarily from construction real estate tourism and retail spending that trickles down to the exchange-listed companies and the broader economy as a whole.

“Specifically Qatar’s objective is to use the event as a springboard to showcase its offerings and hopefully boost international tourist arrivals from 2.1 million in 2019 to 6 million per year by 2030” said Saugata Sarkar head of research at QNB Financial Services.

Qatari equities are already in an investment sweet spot benefitting from unique tailwinds. Adding to high oil and gas prices significant net foreign investment flows given Qatar’s status as a safe haven and hosting the upcoming World Cup the country has also undertaken an expansion of its liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities that will nearly double its gas output catapulting it to the pole position as a major producer.

“We believe that these drivers could be largely priced into the market but should provide the QSE Index with high-quality catalysts that help grow or stabilise the market despite the overall prevalent global risk-off backdrop” Sarkar said.

“While we cannot rule out near-term volatility in the market we continue to remain bullish longer-term on Qatari stocks given their defensive characteristics backed by their strong fundamentals. Net-net we expect strong results from Qatari companies in 2022 largely driven by the FIFA World Cup” he added.

The spoiler will be the war in Ukraine he cautioned which is keeping Qatari and global indices volatile.

However what works in Qatar’s favour as the world deals with the possibility of a recession is the fact that the country’s economic growth is tied to its gas production.

With new demand coming from Europe because of the Ukraine war and the fact that Qatar is the “lowest-cost” producer “it is better prepared to absorb the negative impact a recession may have on energy prices” said Mohsin Mujtaba director product and development QSE. That will also be attractive to foreign investors as they look to rebalance their portfolios in the face of a global slowdown he added.

Long-term effect

According to regional equity experts the projects initiated by the government of Qatar to host FIFA 2022 will have a long-term effect on listed companies across various sectors.

BDSwiss MENA CEO Daniel Takieddine said in an email that while the hundreds of thousands of visitors coming for the month-long football tournament will have an immediate effect “more lasting consequences on the economy and financial markets in the country could be recorded. The widely followed event could draw attention from individuals and companies alike to Qatar as a tourism spot and as an investment destination boosting inflows of capital.”

Oliver Kent managing director at Dubai-based ZK Sports & Entertainment said he looks at the World Cup as “just the start of a series of large-scale events that will draw visitors in large numbers boosting the tourism sector over the longer term” citing a Formula 1 race and the 2023 Asia Cup that the country will host next year.

Qatar 2022 CEO Nasser al-Khater expects that the FIFA World Cup will contribute $17bn to Qatar’s economy during the event down from an initial estimate of $20bn.

While the primary beneficiaries will be the hospitality industry including hotels malls shops and retail Al Rayan Investment’s Khan said several listed small and mid-cap companies that won government contracts as suppliers to larger firms over the last several years will equally benefit. These include firms that provide paving stones and building materials as well as apartment rental and security services among others he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbWFya2V0cy9zdG9ja3MvbmV3cy9waXJhbWFsLXBoYXJtYS1wbHVuZ2VzLTQ4LXNpbmNlLWxpc3Rpbmctb24tc2VsbGluZy1wcmVzc3VyZS9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NTYxNjU1My5jbXPSAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL21hcmtldHMvc3RvY2tzL25ld3MvcGlyYW1hbC1waGFybWEtcGx1bmdlcy00OC1zaW5jZS1saXN0aW5nLW9uLXNlbGxpbmctcHJlc3N1cmUvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk1NjE2NTUzLmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Piramal Pharma plunges 48% since listing on selling pressure,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbWFya2V0cy9zdG9ja3MvbmV3cy9waXJhbWFsLXBoYXJtYS1wbHVuZ2VzLTQ4LXNpbmNlLWxpc3Rpbmctb24tc2VsbGluZy1wcmVzc3VyZS9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NTYxNjU1My5jbXPSAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL21hcmtldHMvc3RvY2tzL25ld3MvcGlyYW1hbC1waGFybWEtcGx1bmdlcy00OC1zaW5jZS1saXN0aW5nLW9uLXNlbGxpbmctcHJlc3N1cmUvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk1NjE2NTUzLmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E611FD0400>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbWFya2V0cy9zdG9ja3MvbmV3cy9waXJhbWFsLXBoYXJtYS1wbHVuZ2VzLTQ4LXNpbmNlLWxpc3Rpbmctb24tc2VsbGluZy1wcmVzc3VyZS9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NTYxNjU1My5jbXPSAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL21hcmtldHMvc3RvY2tzL25ld3MvcGlyYW1hbC1waGFybWEtcGx1bmdlcy00OC1zaW5jZS1saXN0aW5nLW9uLXNlbGxpbmctcHJlc3N1cmUvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk1NjE2NTUzLmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tLmF1LzIwMjIvMTEvMjAvMy10b3AtZXRmcy1mb3ItYXN4LWludmVzdG9ycy10by1idXktYW5kLWhvbGQtZm9yLWEtZGVjYWRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 top ETFs for ASX investors to buy and hold for a decade,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tLmF1LzIwMjIvMTEvMjAvMy10b3AtZXRmcy1mb3ItYXN4LWludmVzdG9ycy10by1idXktYW5kLWhvbGQtZm9yLWEtZGVjYWRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E611FD2E60>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tLmF1LzIwMjIvMTEvMjAvMy10b3AtZXRmcy1mb3ItYXN4LWludmVzdG9ycy10by1idXktYW5kLWhvbGQtZm9yLWEtZGVjYWRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,
