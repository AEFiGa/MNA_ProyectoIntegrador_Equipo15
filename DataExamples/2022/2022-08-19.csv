The researchers found that average costs per employee will reach $13800 in 2023. This is more than double the 3% increase that employers saw in 2022 but far below the current inflation index according to Aon.

On average employers budgeted $13020 per employee for the 2022 plan year. Much like the rest of the industry employers saw far lower medical claims costs during the COVID-19 pandemic with costs returning to more typical growth levels over the past year and inflation likely to play a role in driving up costs moving forward.

""In complete contrast over the last decades we are measuring that health care budgets for U.S. employers will come in nearly three times lower than the Consumer Price Index this calendar year"" said Debbie Ashford the North America chief actuary for health solutions at Aon in a release. ""Despite this historic occurrence employer health costs are expected to increase 6.5 percent in 2023 due to economic inflation pressures.""

The data come from the firm's Health Value Initiative database which includes 700 employers with 5.6 million employees in the U.S.

Ashford said that while price increases driven by inflation may not be felt immediately in healthcare due to the long-term nature of provider contacts they will likely become apparent in the coming year. Other factors driving cost increases include new technology blockbuster drugs specialty drugs and severe catastrophic claims.

One key solution for employers looking to address rising costs is to find ways to address chronic conditions the Aon analysts said. These include long-term illnesses as well as complex diseases and Ashford said it's not uncommon to see 1% of an employer's plan membership driving 40% of costs.

Plan sponsors should gather more data and use that information to predict where and when these excess costs may arise Ashford said.

""The effect of chronic conditions has far-reaching implications beyond what we see with health care costs out to the other areas of the business like absence and productivity disability and worker's compensation"" said Farheen Dam Aon's North America health solutions leader in a statement.

International trail runner Erwee’s presence testified to the quality at the sharp end but the turnout of 50 teams featuring people of all abilities showcased the broader appeal of the relays.

There were also awards for top mixed and women’s team – which went to Hedosophia Two and Roadrunners respectively.

At the sharp end Island star James Priest gave his IQ-EQ mixed team an early lead with the day’s best leg of 4-02.

But it was ultimately a race of consistency and after Jake Robin handed off within the top six Ravenscroft took the front through Jake Le Marchant consolidating this through the efforts of Sam McKerrell and anchorman Brown.

They eventually won in 18-01 and Brown said that felt ‘brilliant’.

‘We all set the scene together’ he said.

‘I’ve been doing all the training and I was like “Right let’s rope in a team”.

‘Ravenscroft usually do try and do one every year and we had a couple of teams this year but we had some guys who are half-decent runners and it all came together which is very good.’

He was similarly enthusiastic in his feedback for the event praising the ‘completely different mix of people’ who take part among other things.

‘It’s nice to do something different and there’s so much support – we had a load of guys waiting down at Balthazar so we had all the cheering there. You get loads of people who wait and cheer.

‘Actually it’s quite good fun to run through Town as you spend so much time walking through it so yeah it’s a good chance to have a crack at that.’

Mike Batiste of Guernsey Press: Print Runners (Hacks) also posted a notably fast leg at 4-05 as HSBC PMT’s Sam Hall ran 4-17 for third individual.

Roadrunners’ Susie Armstrong 4-50 topped the women’s standings with both her teammate Savannah Goddard and Distance Matters’ Liz Dudin sharing the same time of 5-08.",,,,,,

AAPL,Apple Inc.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlY3VyaXR5bWFnYXppbmUuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzk4MTk4LWFwcGxlLXdhcm5zLW9mLWN5YmVyc2VjdXJpdHktdnVsbmVyYWJpbGl0aWVzLWFmZmVjdGluZy1taWxsaW9ucy1vZi1kZXZpY2Vz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple warns of cybersecurity vulnerabilities affecting millions of devices,"Apple has released updates for two disclosed security vulnerabilities with the potential to be exploited on millions of Apple devices.

According to the tech company a kernel vulnerability — CVE-2022-32894 — and a WebKit vulnerability — CVE-2022-32893 — are present on various devices including iPhones (6s or later) all iPad Pros iPad Airs (2 or later) iPads (5 or later) iPad minis (4 or later) seventh generation iPod touches and Mac computers running macOS Big Sur Catalina or Monterey.

Cybersecurity vulnerabilities open devices up to threats

Apple has pushed updates patching the vulnerabilities out to users of iPhone iPad and Mac devices. Anonymous security researchers uncovered the vulnerabilities and the tech company stated that they are ""aware of a report that [these issues] may have been actively exploited.""

The kernel vulnerability (CVE-2022-32894) may allow applications to ""execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges"" while the WebKit vulnerability (CVE-2022-32893) may allow arbitrary code execution if malicious web content is processed via Safari according to the company's disclosure statements.

The vulnerabilities may be related to one another according to TechCrunch.

Mobile device security remains a critical enterprise security strategy

The vulnerabilities have the potential to expose enterprise networks via mobile devices says Richard Melick Director of Threat Reporting at Zimperium.

""Mobile is a critical part of the enterprise workforce but remains a largely unaddressed attack surface ripe for exploitation and compromise"" said Melick. ""These latest exploits and vulnerabilities revealed by Apple are just a few of the mobile-specific attacks we have seen this year. Last year the data showed a 466% increase in mobile-specific zero-day vulnerabilities accounting for one in three of all reported zero-day attacks. So far this year we have seen roughly the same volume of zero-day attacks against mobile with seven of the 23 in the wild attacks being mobile specific. All it takes is one mobile device to fall victim to an exploit as part of a larger attack chain leaving enterprise data integrity compromised.""

Mobile device security is also a critical part of executive protection. With these high-profile cybersecurity vulnerabilities affecting Apple devices enterprise security leaders should assess their business leaders' cyber risk. Rajiv Pimplaskar CEO of Dispersive Holdings Inc. highlighted the cybersecurity risks threatening executive devices. ""According to BlackCloak research 87% of executive devices have no security measures at all installed and 76% are actively leaking data. The Apple security vulnerabilities taken in this context are a stark reminder of the dangers of an expanded attack surface with the proliferation of mobile endpoints"" he said.

Affected organizations and users can install the updates released by Apple to protect their devices from exploits of the disclosed vulnerabilities. According to Corey Sinclair Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyst at Horizon3ai ""We often find that malicious threat actors do not take advantage of zero-day vulnerabilities. Rather successful cyber threat actors target companies and organizations that run outdated software and operating systems by using years-old vulnerabilities and weaknesses that vendors have already issued patches and/or published fix-or mitigation actions.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA1LzA1L2Fib3J0aW9uLXRyYXZlbC1iZW5lZml0LXViZXItYXBwbGUtYW1hem9uLWx5ZnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Abortion cost benefits: Amazon Apple more help employees with travel,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA1LzA1L2Fib3J0aW9uLXRyYXZlbC1iZW5lZml0LXViZXItYXBwbGUtYW1hem9uLWx5ZnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159B87A15D0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA1LzA1L2Fib3J0aW9uLXRyYXZlbC1iZW5lZml0LXViZXItYXBwbGUtYW1hem9uLWx5ZnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy90ZWNobm9sb2d5LTYyNjAyOTA50gEwaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RlY2hub2xvZ3ktNjI2MDI5MDkuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hackers may have exploited security flaws - Apple,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vbWFya2V0cy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL25ld3Mvc3RvY2tzL3doeS15b3VyLXNoaW55LW5ldy1hcHBsZS13YXRjaC04LW1heS1ub3QtYmUtbWFkZS1pbi1jaGluYS0xMDMxNjk1MzMw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Your Shiny New Apple Watch 8 May Not Be 'Made In China',"Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) next smartwatch iteration could be mostly shipped from a non-China country according to TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.

What Happened: In Kuo’s estimate the shipment proportion of the Apple Watch emanating out of Vietnam will “significantly rise” to 60-70%.

Electronic components manufacturer Luxshare is “the leader in building production lines in non-China countries among Chinese Apple suppliers” Kuo said in a tweet on Thursday.

The analyst said that “the first mover advantage” enjoyed by Luxhsare is conducive to its “long-term development amid the deglobalization trend.”

The media reported that Apple Watch would start mass production in Vietnam. But it's already shipping as I know. Luxshare ICT Apple Watch's major assembler has production lines in China and Vietnam and has shipped from Vietnam since Apple Watch 7. — 郭明錤 (Ming-Chi Kuo) (@mingchikuo) August 19 2022

Kuo said though it has been reported that Apple Watch mass production will begin in Vietnam but it’s already shipping from there.

“Luxshare ICT Apple Watch's major assembler has production lines in China and Vietnam and has shipped from Vietnam since Apple Watch 7.”

Why It Matters: Luxshare was founded by Wang Laichun after she spent a decade at important Apple supplier Hon Hai Precision Industry Company Ltd (OTC:HNHPF) also known as Foxconn reported The Telegraph.

Foxconn has previously taken exception to its rivals shifting base to Vietnam and allegedly poaching its workforce.

It was reported that Apple is looking to increase its production outside China. The Tim Cook-led company is said to have told some of its manufacturers that due to stringent COVID-19 norms across China it wants to boost production out of that country.

Price Action: On Thursday Apple shares declined 0.2% to $174.15 in the regular session according to data from Benzinga Pro.

You need to get over your reclining seat rage,"Editor’s Note: Heather Poole is a flight attendant for a major US carrier and author of “Cruising Attitude: Tales of Crashpads Crew Drama and Crazy Passengers at 30000 Feet.” The views in this commentary are her own.

CNN —

Last night on a flight from London to New York a passenger rang his call light and when my colleague walked over turned off the light and asked him if he needed something he simply pointed to the reclined seat in front of him.

The flight attendant told him that his seat was also in the reclined position and then mentioned that the seat next to him — the aisle seat — was available and that he could sit there. The man said he didn’t want to move to the aisle seat because he wanted to sit by the window.

Sometimes there are no solutions to problems like this.

Another day another flight: “If you put your seat back one more time I’m going to punch you in the face” said an older woman to a teenage girl seated in front of her. The young girl’s eyes looked like they might pop out of their sockets.

While standing in the aisle pouring a can of Diet Coke into a cup of ice I told the aggrieved passenger that nobody was going to punch anyone and that if she said another word about it or did anything to anyone authorities would be called to meet the flight.

“He’s in my lap!” cried a different passenger on a different flight. This one sat in the window seat.

I looked at the woman and then at the man in front who was clearly not in her lap. He was close though about a foot away. Sorry I mouthed. I handed her a can of club soda and a cup of ice and communicated to her in words I knew she’d understand: “Unfortunately he’s allowed to be in your lap.”

Besides lack of wifi or a broken entertainment system flight attendants hear more complaints about reclined seats than anything else.

The heart of the problem is that airlines are packing too many seats too closely together into a tight space. Remember legroom? But this squeeze doesn’t give passengers the right to react in such a way that the crew feels the need to divert a flight to have a passenger removed. That’s a really big deal that usually ends up with someone in police custody.

While I dread these altercations I think some passengers need to chill out — people have the right to recline their seat. Nobody has to ask for permission to recline their seat. Some people believe passengers have to put their seats in the upright position during the meal service. This isn’t true. At least not with US carriers even though it’s a nice thing to do.

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. Heather Poole

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. If you kick the seat or threaten to punch someone in the face you’ll be the one removed from the flight — not the person who moved their seat back two inches.

Not all airlines are created equal. Yes some airlines are taking away the recline option on all seats but these are mostly low-cost carriers which should tell you something about what those passengers want: cheap flights … including seats that don’t recline. (A friend who often flies Air France on short and medium-hop routes in Europe tells me that their seats are all locked upright. “I’ve never seen anyone get worked up about it” he said.)

Airlines are desperate to cut costs. It’s rumored that American Airlines removed a single olive off of business class meal trays and saved $40000 a year. So you’d think that 150 lighter seats per flight will certainly save an airline a ton of money. Remember the recline mechanism in the seat makes it heavier which increases fuel costs for the airline. A lighter seat that doesn’t recline is also a seat that is less likely to break which saves an airline money in repairs.

Non-reclining seats are nothing new. Major carriers have always had a few seats that don’t recline. Think exit rows and the last row. While some passengers aren’t always happy to get one of these seats it never seems to be that big of a deal.

But after 28 years in the job I’ve found there’s some basic reclining etiquette that makes for a smoother flight for everyone.

A reminder: chances are the person in front of you has no idea they’ve crossed that mental barrier between you and the rest of the world. You can’t kick them or scream at them but you can politely ask if they’d mind putting their seat back up. I bet if you ask nicely they’ll do it.

If you’re a passenger who likes to recline it’s always a good idea to be mindful of the situation that we are all collectively in and do so slowly. Yanking the seat back too quickly could make a mess if the person behind you has their tray table down.

Sure everyone feels cramped in coach seats. But the bigger you are the tighter the squeeze so consider glancing back before you adjust your seat. If it’s Shaquille O’Neal behind you maybe give the guy a break.

We do see spilled drinks and from time to time broken laptops. Seasoned business passengers know what to expect and book seats with more legroom. But on coach middle seat passengers struggle to type because there’s no arm space. The table is so much smaller these days and there’s barely room for a drink. So if you think you’re going to work on your laptop and balance a cup of coffee on that table well you might need to seriously rethink your spatial judgement.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned flying the unfriendly skies it’s this: you can’t please everyone. Somebody is going to suffer somebody is going to have a miserable flight somebody will be assigned the last row or a middle seat or will have to come into contact with a child. Now I’m going to tell you what I used to tell my son when he was little every time we traveled together: there’s no crying in flying. Toughen up.

Really this isn’t a war on reclined seats. This is about space and most airlines give you the option to purchase more space. So remember that next time you’re searching for the cheapest flight.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2RhdmlkYXhlLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvYS11a3JhaW5pYW4tbS0yLWZpZ2h0aW5nLXZlaGljbGUtc25lYWtlZC11cC1vbi1hLXJ1c3NpYW4tdC04MC10YW5rLWF0LW5pZ2h0LWFuZC1oaXQtaXQtd2l0aC1hLW1pc3NpbGUtZnJvbS1hLW1pbGUtYXdheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Ukrainian M-2 Sneaked Up On A Russian Tank—And Hit From A Mile Away,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2RhdmlkYXhlLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvYS11a3JhaW5pYW4tbS0yLWZpZ2h0aW5nLXZlaGljbGUtc25lYWtlZC11cC1vbi1hLXJ1c3NpYW4tdC04MC10YW5rLWF0LW5pZ2h0LWFuZC1oaXQtaXQtd2l0aC1hLW1pc3NpbGUtZnJvbS1hLW1pbGUtYXdheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159B7F9EA10>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2RhdmlkYXhlLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvYS11a3JhaW5pYW4tbS0yLWZpZ2h0aW5nLXZlaGljbGUtc25lYWtlZC11cC1vbi1hLXJ1c3NpYW4tdC04MC10YW5rLWF0LW5pZ2h0LWFuZC1oaXQtaXQtd2l0aC1hLW1pc3NpbGUtZnJvbS1hLW1pbGUtYXdheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9vcGluaW9ucy8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L3Jmay1icmFpbi13b3JtLWtlbm5lZHktc2F0aXJlLXBldHJpL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion | I'm the worm that ate part of RFK Jr.'s brain and I'm asking for your vote,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9vcGluaW9ucy8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L3Jmay1icmFpbi13b3JtLWtlbm5lZHktc2F0aXJlLXBldHJpL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159BA3C89A0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9vcGluaW9ucy8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L3Jmay1icmFpbi13b3JtLWtlbm5lZHktc2F0aXJlLXBldHJpL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Copenhagen travel to Türkiye defending a 2-1 first-leg lead as their UEFA Champions League play-off against Trabzonspor concludes with both sides eager to end lengthy absences from the group stage.

The Danish champions took a firm grip on the first leg in Copenhagen thanks to goals early in each half from Viktor Claesson (9) and Lukas Lerager (49) but Trabzonspor gained a foothold in the tie thanks to Tasos Bakasetas' deflected strike 11 minutes from time– the club's first goal in Denmark and the first conceded at home to a Turkish side by Copenhagen.

While Trabzonspor's sole previous group appearance came 11 seasons ago Copenhagen are aiming to reach the competition's last 32 for the first time in six years.

The first leg was the sides' first fixture and while Copenhagen have plenty of recent experience of Turkish opponents – including at this stage of last season's UEFA Europa Conference League – Trabzonspor had not faced a Danish club in more than 30 years before this tie.

Trabzonspor are unbeaten in their two home matches against Danish visitors although Copenhagen claimed their first win in Türkiye on their most recent visit.

Form guide

Trabzonspor

Trabzonspor are bidding to reach the group stage for only the second time. In 2011/12 they finished third in Group B behind Inter and CSKA Moskva having picked up seven points their sole victory a 1-0 win in Milan on Matchday 1.

That season was also Trabzonspor's third and most recent previous appearance in UEFA Champions League qualifying after 2004/05 and 2005/06. They lost to Benfica in the third qualifying round (0-2 a 1-1 h) but were subsequently installed in the group stage after Fenerbahçe were disqualified.

The Black Sea team who were beaten by PSV Eindhoven (1-2 h 1-4 a) in the 2011/12 UEFA Europa League round of 32 after transferring across from the UEFA Champions League have subsequently featured in that competition's group stage three times reaching the last 32 in 2013/14 and 2014/15 but making no further progress in 2019/20.

In 2021/22 Trabzonspor overcame Molde 4-3 on penalties in the UEFA Europa Conference League third qualifying round (3-3 h 1-1 a) only to lose to eventual champions Roma in the play-offs (1-2 h 0-3 a).

Trabzonspor claimed their first Turkish Süper Lig title since 1983/84 and their seventh overall last season under coach Abdullah Avcı and are now attempting to become only the fourth club from their country to feature in multiple UEFA Champions League group campaigns after Galatasaray (16 appearances) Beşiktaş (eight) and Fenerbahçe (six).

All four of Trabzonspor's previous games with Danish opponents before this tie came against B1903 København one of the clubs that merged to form F.C. Copenhagen in 1992. The Turkish side won 1-0 at home in the 1977/78 European Cup first round first leg but were eliminated following a 2-0 away defeat; they were also beaten on their next visit to Copenhagen 1-0 in the 1991/92 UEFA Cup third round first leg before drawing 1-1 at home.

Trabzonspor are without a win in their last six European home games (D2 L4) since a 2-1 defeat of Sparta Praha in the 2019/20 UEFA Europa League third qualifying round second leg.

Trabzonspor have won only one of the 13 UEFA competition ties in which they lost the away first leg most recently going out to Rabotnički in the 2015/16 UEFA Europa League third qualifying round (0-1 a 1-1 h aet). Their sole aggregate win came after a 2-1 away defeat however against Slovan Bratislava in the 1996/97 UEFA Cup qualifying round (4-1 h); in the only other tie in which they were beaten 2-1 away in the first game against Oțelul Galați in the 2007 UEFA Intertoto Cup third round they went down by the same score at home.

Trabzonspor's record in two UEFA penalty shoot-outs is W1 L1:

2-4 v Videoton 2012/13 UEFA Europa League qualifying play-offs

4-3 v Molde 2021/22 UEFA Europa Conference League third qualifying round

Copenhagen

Copenhagen are aiming to reach the group stage for the fifth time and the first since 2016/17. No other Danish side has featured more than twice.

On their last group stage appearance six seasons ago Copenhagen finished third in Group G behind Leicester City and Porto despite taking nine points from their six fixtures losing only once. That was the third of their four campaigns in the UEFA Champions League proper to have ended at that point the exception 2010/11 when they lost to Chelsea in the round of 16.

Copenhagen's record in UEFA Champions League play-offs is W2 L5 the most recent tie bringing defeat on away goals against Qarabağ in 2017/18 (0-1 a 2-1 h). A loss on penalties to Crvena zvezda in the 2019/20 third qualifying round made it ten eliminations in their 13 previous UEFA Champions League qualification campaigns.

In 2021/22 Jess Thorup's team came through three qualifying rounds to reach the inaugural UEFA Europa Conference League group stage where they won five of their six games to top Group F. However they were subsequently brushed aside by PSV Eindhoven in the round of 16 (4-4 a 0-4 h).

Copenhagen claimed their 14th Danish league title all since 1993 and their fourth in seven seasons in 2021/22.

The Danish side won away (2-1) and home (5-0) against Sivasspor in last season's UEFA Europa Conference League qualifying play-offs. Their overall record against Turkish sides is now W5 L2. That win at Sivasspor was their first in Türkiye after two defeats in Istanbul.

Copenhagen are unbeaten in their last eight away European games (W6 D2). Their last defeat came in Türkiye – 0-1 against İstanbul Başakşehir in the first leg of their 2019/20 UEFA Europa League round of 16 tie which they won thanks to a 3-0 second-leg victory in Denmark.

Copenhagen have won 17 of the 21 European ties in which they were victorious in the first leg most recently beating Torpedo Zhodino in last season's UEFA Europa Conference League second qualifying round (4-1 h 5-0 a). However they have lost both ties where they won the home first leg 2-1 against Lazio in the 2001/02 UEFA Champions League third qualifying round (1-4 a) and Ajax in the 2016/17 UEFA Europa League round of 16 (0-2 a).

Copenhagen's record in three UEFA penalty shoot-outs is W2 L1:

3-2 v Ferencváros 2003/04 UEFA Cup first round

4-3 v Atalanta 2018/19 UEFA Europa League qualifying play-off

6-7 v Crvena zvezda 2019/20 UEFA Champions League third qualifying round

Bob Casey goes after Dave McCormick on Connecticut residency,"PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — The race between Sen. Bob Casey and his Republican challenger former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick is expected to be one of the most hotly contested elections in the nation.

Casey's name is synonymous with Pennsylvania especially Scranton. But it didn't take Casey long to label McCormick a Connecticut Yankee for living outside the state for many years.

""He hasn't told the truth about where he lives"" Casey said. ""He lives in Connecticut. He hasn't been truthful about that. So you have an out-of-state candidate who's being supported by out-of-state billionaires.""

KDKA-TV's Jon Delano: ""Where do you live?""

McCormick: ""I live in Pennsylvania. I live in Pittsburgh.""

Just before his run for U.S. Senate in 2022 McCormick who is divorced and remarried sold his home in Connecticut bought a home in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill and rented another home in Connecticut.

""My youngest daughter lives with her mother in Connecticut so I periodically go back to Connecticut to see my daughter. Being a good dad is even more important than being a good senator"" McCormick said.

McCormick grew up in Bloomsburg where his father was president of Bloomsburg University. But he also lived outside the state working first for the Bush administration and then as president and CEO of Bridgewater Associates a Connecticut-based multi-billion dollar hedge fund from 2009 to 2022.

McCormick sees the Connecticut residency issue as a distraction from Casey's record.

""When you have the results that Bob Casey has with inflation border crime the war on oil and gas the world falling apart what do you do? Well you try to make it about something that is unrelated in your opponent"" McCormick said.

But Casey says McCormick's long out-of-state residency coupled with his work for a hedge fund associated with multi-millionaires demonstrates who he will represent in the Senate.

""He hadn't voted in Pennsylvania in about 16 years. So I think that's going to be an issue. But I think ultimately it's going to be about whose side you are on"" Casey said.

Casey sees himself as representing hard-working middle-class Pennsylvanians while McCormick argues that Casey has failed to deliver any results.

McCormick criticizes Casey for supporting President Biden's infrastructure bill CHIPS and Science Act the Inflation Reduction Act and other bills.

""Bob Casey has been a 98% vote for Joe Biden"" McCormick said.

Casey sees himself as a soft-spoken doer who gets things done for this part of Pennsylvania.

""The bridge investment alone is about a quarter of a billion dollars just for bridges"" Casey said. ""But there's investments for K-12 education investments for communities all across the board whether it was in the infrastructure bill the American Rescue legislation or otherwise. So we've been able to get resources to communities to try to lift them up but we still have work to do so I want to keep delivering.""

The two candidates disagree on other issues as well like abortion. Casey who is personally pro-life supports the Women's Health Protection Act to codify abortion rights nationwide while McCormick opposes abortion with limited exceptions and opposes all federal legislation on the subject.

""Our states should decide"" McCormick said. ""Pennsylvania should decide as it has. My belief is that we shouldn't have bans. We shouldn't have national legislation.""

Casey says McCormick's work at the hedge fund to promote China will be another issue.

""When China cheats Pennsylvania loses jobs. So he's helped to fuel that rise of China and I think that's going to be a major issue in the campaign"" Casey said.

Delano: ""So you're suggesting he's soft on China?""

Casey: ""I don't think there's any question about it compared to what I've been doing.""

""I've been in business"" McCormick said. ""Yes my business did 2% of its business in China. I know what it's like to negotiate against the Chinese in the government and in business. There is no one better equipped to deal with the challenge of China than me.""

These are just a few of many issues on which Casey and McCormick disagree. Given the millions both campaigns will spend expect to hear a lot more in the months ahead."

McDonald’s Chicken Big Mac was a huge hit in the United Kingdom. Now it’s crossing the pond.

Beginning later this month the burger chain is testing the fan favorite at select restaurants in Miami for a limited time. The Chicken Big Mac is similar to its meaty sibling however it replaces the two burgers with two tempura chicken patties. Of course it also includes the signature Big Mac sauce pickles shredded lettuce and a slice of American cheese.

McDonald's is testing the Chicken Big Mac in Miami.

McDonald’s briefly sold the limited-time offering earlier this year in the UK. The Chicken Big Mac was so popular that it sold out about 10 days after it made its debut. The chain said that it was its “most popular launch ever” in the UK and Ireland.

In a statement McDonald’s said that it’s “always looking to give our fans more ways to enjoy the classic menu items they know and love.” However it cautioned that the Chicken Big Mac is just being tested and it will use “this time to gather feedback from both customers and restaurant crew as we consider opportunities to offer more delicious options in the future.”

Chicken is cheaper than beef and is a favorite among fast food eaters (see: the ongoing chicken sandwich war). Poultry is also a “priority area” for the company according to McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski.

“Chicken continues to be a significant opportunity for us” he said in an recent earnings call. “We’ve got some great global equities already in our McNuggets and with McChicken but we also have some equities in McCrispy and McSpicy that we think we’ve got an opportunity to do more with globally.”

McDonald’s said in July that sales at its US restaurants open at least 13 months jumped 3.7% in the second quarter with growth being driven by higher menu prices and “value offerings” on its regular menu as well as through its app.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vZm94NTkuY29tL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uYWwtd29ybGQvbWNkb25hbGRzLXRlc3RpbmctY2hpY2tlbi1iaWctbWFjLXdoYXQtd2Uta25vdy1zby1mYXIv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly9mb3g1OS5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXRpb25hbC13b3JsZC9tY2RvbmFsZHMtdGVzdGluZy1jaGlja2VuLWJpZy1tYWMtd2hhdC13ZS1rbm93LXNvLWZhci9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald’s testing Chicken Big Mac; What we know so far,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://fox59.com/news/national-world/mcdonalds-testing-chicken-big-mac-what-we-know-so-far/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vZm94NTkuY29tL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uYWwtd29ybGQvbWNkb25hbGRzLXRlc3RpbmctY2hpY2tlbi1iaWctbWFjLXdoYXQtd2Uta25vdy1zby1mYXIv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly9mb3g1OS5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXRpb25hbC13b3JsZC9tY2RvbmFsZHMtdGVzdGluZy1jaGlja2VuLWJpZy1tYWMtd2hhdC13ZS1rbm93LXNvLWZhci9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnpkbmV0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL21jZG9uYWxkcy13YW50cy1jdXN0b21lcnMtdG8tdXNlLWl0cy1hcHAtZm9yLWEtdHJ1bHktcGl0aWZ1bC1yZWFzb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's wants customers to use its app for a truly pitiful reason,"Oh his lover will really appreciate this. (A screenshot from a McDonald's ad.) Chris Matyszczyk/screenshot

It's all about the money.

It's always about the money.

When one of your favorite brands begins to encourage you to use its app there's really only one reason -- to get you to buy its wares more often.

That's where the pandemic suited fast-food brands perfectly. People were stuck at home. They could use apps to get pick-up or delivery. For the likes of McDonald's and Chick-fil-A business did rather well.

You might wonder though what McDonald's is thinking now. I might tell you that it wants you to use its app for well please take a little saunter with me.

The burger chain's UK arm has just released an ad that may boggle minds and even stomachs.

It features a long-distance truck driver. It's a tough job. It requires a lot of sitting. It requires a lot of pining for your loved one who in this case is called Lorraine. It also apparently requires a lot of eating at McDonald's.

Here you see our trucker passes his time by singing -- just one song in fact. ""Coming Home"" by Leon Bridges. He also passes his time stopping at every conceivable McDonald's he can.

""Why would he do that?"" you might ask. Perhaps that's all that's open on his travels. Perhaps it's the sheer convenience and value that seduces him.

Or perhaps it's the fact that he feels an urgent need to use his app to rack up as many McDonald's MyRewards points as he can.

One or two people may fear for his health. All he seems to eat is more and more McDonald's. A lot of McDonald's.

The points are mounting at a precipitous pace. Could this truck driver have really eaten every breakfast lunch and dinner at the same place?

Could the people who approved this ad not have wondered that this doesn't set a healthy example for those who'd like to live a long time?

Why is he really doing this? It's here that McDonald's tries to turn on the charm. This truck driver you see has earned enough points to get himself a free McChicken sandwich.

Free always has its attractions. How lovely that he won't have to pay for this delicacy.

Oh but then there's a twist.

The lovely Lorraine is there to meet him at the door of what one presumes is their home. Our hero saunters into the kitchen clutching a gift for her behind his back.

You're already there aren't you? It's the McChicken Sandwich.

Also: McDonald's and Chick-fil-A both have a big problem. Only one has a solution

Yes our hero loves his Lorraine so much that he's stuffed his face for days and days just so that he can avoid paying $1.29 -- at least in the US -- for a gift to impress his Lorraine.

Oh it's all played as if this is something of a joke.

But how many on watching this ad might consider a few things?

One a fast-food brand encouraging its customers to constantly fill their gullets with rather unhealthy food may not be acting entirely responsible.

Two love may not revolve around money but there's still something entirely unloving about bringing a now-cold McChicken Sandwich back to your lover in order to inculcate your questionable eating habits into her life and tell her how much you care.

And three Lorraine is this really the right man for you?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbG9uLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzE5L21jZG9uYWxkcy1pcy10ZXN0aW5nLWEtY2hpY2tlbi12ZXJzaW9uLW9mLWl0cy1tb3N0LWljb25pYy1idXJnZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's is testing a chicken version of its most iconic burger,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbG9uLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzE5L21jZG9uYWxkcy1pcy10ZXN0aW5nLWEtY2hpY2tlbi12ZXJzaW9uLW9mLWl0cy1tb3N0LWljb25pYy1idXJnZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159B9B038E0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbG9uLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzE5L21jZG9uYWxkcy1pcy10ZXN0aW5nLWEtY2hpY2tlbi12ZXJzaW9uLW9mLWl0cy1tb3N0LWljb25pYy1idXJnZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluYy5jb20vYmlsbC1tdXJwaHktanIvYWZ0ZXItNTUteWVhcnMtbWNkb25hbGRzLWp1c3RtYWRlLWEtbG9uZy1hd2FpdGVkLWFubm91bmNlbWVudC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After 55 Years McDonald's Just Made a Long-Awaited Announcement,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/after-55-years-mcdonalds-justmade-a-long-awaited-announcement.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluYy5jb20vYmlsbC1tdXJwaHktanIvYWZ0ZXItNTUteWVhcnMtbWNkb25hbGRzLWp1c3RtYWRlLWEtbG9uZy1hd2FpdGVkLWFubm91bmNlbWVudC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

This includes leveraging Ontada’s RWE platform to “improve community education on the financial impact and value of cancer drugs” as well as looking to “improve patient access to oncology medicines” BeiGene said in a press release.

The exact details of how the Chinese biopharma will do that were not shared though it said that as part of the collaboration the companies “will optimize the use of RWE” to talk up the value of cancer drugs in general across “key stakeholders” which includes patients providers and payers.

Ontada is also on deck to develop what the press release calls “timely education” on emerging science and therapeutic differentiation i.e. highlight new cancer tech coming out of oncology companies such as BeiGene.

The companies will also look to boost use of RWE in both healthcare and regulatory decision-making to “increase timely and affordable patient access to life-saving oncology therapies.”

In a nutshell the idea is for the companies to extoll the virtues of cancer drugs and their inherent value—and partly justify their often-high price tags—using RWE while also hoping to boost their use across the market to increase uptake.

In recent years BeiGene has become a big name in cancer and has an increasing stake in the oncology drug market: It has three approved drugs including BTK inhibitor Brukinsa which won FDA approval in the U.S. back in 2019 as well as PD-1 antibody tislelizumab and PARP inhibitor pamiparib which are both approved in China.

On top of that portfolio the company has a host of pipeline meds and a series of commercial clinical and manufacturing collabs with the likes of Novartis Bristol Myers Squibb and Amgen.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL2NoaWNhZ28uc3VudGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvOC8xOS8yMzMwOTg4MC9vcGlvaWQtY3Jpc2lzLWRvbi1oYXJtb24tam9obnNvbi1qb2huc29uLWFiYnZpZS1hbGxlcmdhbi1jYXJkaW5hbC1oZWFsdGgtbWNrZXNzb24tYW1lcmlzb3VyY2VuZXJnZW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Illinois Senate President Don Harmon other pols keep taking money from pharma companies implicated in opioid crisis,"In 2017 Ohio’s attorney general sued Johnson & Johnson and other drugmakers saying they had wrongly “led prescribers to believe that opioids were not addictive that addiction was an easy thing to overcome or that addiction could actually be treated by taking even more opioids.”

In 2019 government lawyers in Oklahoma called Johnson & Johnson the “kingpin” of the opioid crisis likening the pharmaceutical giant to a Mexican drug cartel.

In 2021 New York’s top law enforcement figure declared that opioids “wreaked havoc on countless communities” and that Johnson & Johnson “helped fuel this fire.”

But Illinois politicians keep taking campaign money from Johnson & Johnson and other companies paying $26 billion to settle lawsuits that accused them of fueling the opioid crisis campaign-finance records show.

Illinois Senate President Don Harmon D-Oak Park is the most prominent among them. Harmon has accepted these campaign contributions tied to the companies that have been painted by government lawyers across the nation as corporate bad guys in the opioid crisis:



$2000 last September from a Johnson & Johnson political action committee.

$2000 in 2020 from a Johnson & Johnson fund.

$2000 in December from Fidelity Consulting Group LLC a Rosemont lobbying firm that lobbies for Johnson & Johnson.

$7500 over the past two years from firms that lobby on behalf of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America a Washington D.C. trade group to which Johnson & Johnson and other opioid sellers belong.

Harmon won’t talk about taking campaign contributions from companies linked to the opioid crisis.

Opioid cash won’t ‘compromise his values’

Asked about why he keeps taking that money a spokesman for the Illinois Democrat rather than answering questions says: “Over two decades in office President Harmon has tirelessly fought for progressive policies that make the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share lower health care costs for working families and protect consumers from abuse. No donation from any source will ever compromise his values.”

Asked about its political contributions a Johnson & Johnson spokeswoman points to a statement on the company’s website that says: “We do not expect candidates who receive contributions from our employee political action committee or our company to agree with our positions on all or any specific policy issues. Rather we seek to support candidates who recognize the importance of medical innovation in improving lives and that a fair market-based system provides the best environment for continued innovation. We also seek to support candidates who recognize the importance of broad access to quality affordable health care.”

Earlier this year Johnson & Johnson was among four companies that agreed to pay $26 billion to settle lawsuits that accused them of making money off the highly addictive painkillers while ignoring the health and well-being of users.

Hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths nationwide have been reported in recent years including according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention more than 75000 opioid-related deaths from mid-2020 to mid-2021.

In Cook County more than 10000 deaths since 2016 have been linked to opioid overdoses. Statewide the number is nearly 23000 from 2008 through 2021.

Opioid payout coming to Illinois

State governments are among those that stand to get a piece of the $26 billion settlement — with an estimated $760 million destined for Illinois — to put toward drug-abuse treatment and prevention.

At a news conference last month Harmon’s fellow Democrat Gov. J.B. Pritzker talked about how that money will be handled and called the opioid crisis “one of the most disturbing examples of corporate greed and medical mismanagement in human history.”

Gov. J.B. Pritzker looks on as Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul speaks in Chicago during a campaign event in 2018. Both of their offices are involved in a legal settlement — with an estimated $760 million destined for Illinois — with four companies sued over the opioid crisis. Ashlee Rezin / Sun-Times

Among those involved in the settlement Johnson & Johnson manufactured opioids and Cardinal Health McKesson Corp. and AmerisourceBergen distributed the narcotic painkillers.

Under the settlement each of those companies will pay out billions of dollars. Johnson & Johnson — which like the others who settled rather than face trial hasn’t acknowledged any wrongdoing — also agreed to stop selling opioids in the United States.

Harmon who was elected Senate president in 2020 got a $2000 campaign contribution from McKesson in 2021.

The same year the company also gave $750 to state Rep. Barbara Hernandez D-Aurora. Hernandez who didn’t respond to calls or emails seeking comment was appointed to the Legislature in 2019 when Pritzker tapped her predecessor to head the Illinois Department of Veterans’ Affairs.

Harmon who’s been in the General Assembly since 2003 accepted $250 from Cardinal Health in 2004 according to Illinois State Board of Elections records that show he’s gotten a total of about $150000 from the pharmaceutical industry during his political career.

Campaign-finance records also show:



Illinois House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch who assumed that top legislative post in January 2021 accepted a $2000 campaign contribution from Johnson & Johnson in November $1500 in 2020 and $500 in 2019. Welch also got $750 in 2020 from McKesson. Welch and his aides would not answer questions about those contributions.

Altogether since 1994 Illinois politicians’ campaign funds collectively have gotten about $450000 from the four companies involved in the opioid settlement including about $360000 from Johnson & Johnson.

The pharmaceutical research and manufacturers group gave more than $300000 over the past two decades to Illinois politicians including nearly $140000 to campaign funds that were controlled by Welch’s predecessor former House Speaker Michael Madigan. Sarah Sutton a spokeswoman for the trade group says: “We engage with policymakers from both sides of the aisle who have a wide array of health care opinions and priorities.”

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul whose office is overseeing litigation in Illinois against the pharmaceutical industry took a $1000 campaign contribution from the pharma trade group in 2006 and $500 from Johnson & Johnson in 2015 both while he was in the General Assembly. Elected to his current post in 2018 he took contributions during that campaign from pharmaceutical firms including $500 from AbbVie.

AbbVie also gave pols money

Last month AbbVie which is based in North Chicago agreed to pay more than $2 billion to settle lawsuits over how its Allergan unit which it bought in 2020 marketed opioids.

Teva Pharmaceuticals which bought part of Allergan in 2016 announced a settlement agreement last month that could see it pay more than $4 billion to settle claims over opioids.

Harmon has gotten $25000 in campaign contributions from AbbVie since 2013 including $5000 in June and $15000 in 2021 records show.

AbbVie has given Welch $21500 including $5000 in June and $15000 in 2021 records show.

AbbVie which like Teva is a member of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America the trade group that has given heavily to Illinois politicians gave $1000 to then-state Rep. Christian Mitchell in 2018. After Pritzker took office in early 2019 he named Mitchell as one of his deputy governors.

Mitchell also got a $500 campaign contribution in 2015 from Fidelity Consulting Group. Neither of the lobbyists who run the company returned calls or emails.

Asked about the contributions Mitchell’s response was “Let me talk to my team see if it’s appropriate” to discuss this issue “and get back to you.” He didn’t.

Fidelity gave $1000 in 2021 to state Rep. Robyn Gabel D-Evanston who also got $500 from Johnson & Johnson in December.

Gabel also took $500 in 2016 from Purdue Pharma. The company long run by members of the billionaire Sackler family pleaded guilty in 2007 and 2020 to criminal charges stemming from marketing practices that “downplayed” the addiction risks of the opioid OxyContin.

Gabel has worked in public health for years.

“I’ve worked with pharmaceutical companies around immunization issues for many years for children’s immunizations” Gabel says. “So they throw me a little bit of money once in a while.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1cGVybWFya2V0bmV3cy5jb20vcmV0YWlsLWZpbmFuY2lhbC9tZXRyby1uYW1lcy1uZXctcHJlc2lkZW50LWplYW4tY291dHUtZ3JvdXAtcGhhcm1hY3ktYXJt0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Metro names new president for Jean Coutu Group pharmacy arm,"Jean-Michel Coutu has been appointed president of The Jean Coutu Group the pharmacy division of Canadian food and drug retailer Metro Inc.

Plans call for Coutu to take the reins from current Jean Coutu Group President Alain Champagne on Sept. 26 Montreal-based Metro said. Champagne who has served in the role since May 2019 is leaving the company to become president and CEO of Le Groupe Maurice a senior housing development firm based in Montreal.

Jean-Michel Coutu is the grandson of Jean Coutu Group founder Jean Coutu. Metro acquired the Quebec drug chain in a $4.5 billion (Canadian) deal that was announced in October 2017 and closed in May 2018. The agreement added about 420 Jean Coutu drugstores to Metro’s approximately 260 retail pharmacies under the Brunet Metro Pharmacy and Drug Basics banners.

Metro noted that Coutu has been with the company since 2009 after working in the industry for several years.

“As a pharmacist and a business executive who has worked in the United States and Canada he has deep knowledge of the industry our operations and our opportunities” Metro stated. “Mr. Coutu will continue to execute our strategy and business plans which have allowed Metro to remain the leader in pharmacy in Quebec through our Jean Coutu and Brunet banners while supporting the success of the pharmacists owners affiliated to our banners.”

According to Metro Champagne (pictured left) will work closely with Coutu until the end of September to ensure a smooth leadership transition. Le Group Maurice reported that Champagne is slated to take the helm in October.

Champagne came to Jean Coutu Group effective May 31 2019 with the retirement of François Coutu son of Jean Coutu. Previously Champagne served as partner and CEO at sales training and development firm Optimé International after spending more than six years as president of McKesson Canada. Earlier he spent more than 11 years in regional vice president and sales roles at PepsiCo/Frito-Lay.

Metro noted that Champagne played a pivotal role in the integration of Jean Coutu Group.

“Since joining Metro in 2019 Mr. Champagne has successfully led the combination of the Jean Coutu Group and Metro delivering the synergies required while ensuring the profitable growth of our banners” Metro stated. “He leaves our pharmacy division our banners and our pharmacists owners well-positioned for the future. We thank him for his contributions and leadership and wish him well in his new position.”

Currently Metro’s retail base in Quebec Ontario and New Brunswick includes more than 960 food stores under the Metro Metro Plus Super C Food Basics Adonis Marché Richelieu and Première Moisson banners as well as about 650 drugstores and pharmacies under the Jean Coutu Brunet Metro Pharmacy and Food Basics Pharmacy banners.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9tZGpvbmxpbmUvbmFtZS90aG9tYXMtbGVvbmFyZC1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNjI3ODQwMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Thomas Leonard Obituary (1959 - 2022) - Marietta GA - Marietta Daily Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/mdjonline/name/thomas-leonard-obituary?id=36278401 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9tZGpvbmxpbmUvbmFtZS90aG9tYXMtbGVvbmFyZC1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNjI3ODQwMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

The FDA has identified this as a Class I recall the most serious type of recall. Use of these devices may cause serious injuries serious health consequences or death.

According to a Medtronic spokesperson Medtronic has received FDA approval and CE Mark for a software update to help mitigate this issue. The company began deploying the update into already-implanted Cobalt XT Cobalt and Crome devices via in-clinic device checks in mid-August 2022. Newly manufactured devices will have the update pre-installed starting this month.

Recalled Product

Device Use

Medtronic Cobalt/Crome Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs) and Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillators (CRT-Ds) are implantable cardiac devices that are intended to monitor and regulate heart rate and rhythm. These devices can deliver a pacing impulse to correct a slow heartbeat (bradycardia) provide biventricular pacing/cardiac resynchronization therapyExternal Link Disclaimer or produce an electric shock (cardioversion or defibrillation) to restore a regular heartbeat if a life-threatening arrhythmia occurs.

Reason for Recall

Medtronic is recalling Cobalt/Crome Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs) and Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillators (CRT-Ds) after receiving reports of devices with a short circuit protection (SCP) alert resulting in reduced-energy electric shock delivery instead of delivering a second phase of high voltage therapy.

A reduced-energy electrical shock may fail to correct an irregular heartbeat (arrythmia) or may cause an irregular heartbeat. The harms associated with a reduced-energy electric shock or an inaccurate response to an SCP alert may cause serious injury or death.

There have been 27 complaints no injuries and no deaths associated with this issue.

Who May Be Affected

Patients who have been implanted with Cobalt and Crome ICDs and CRT-Ds

Clinicians who implant and manage patients with Cobalt and Crome ICDs and CRT-Ds

What to Do

On June 22 2022 Medtronic issued a communication to customers. The communication offered the following patient management recommendations and considerations to customers and/or users:

Do not prophylactically replace devices for this issue.

Remotely monitor patients following normal clinical protocol follow-up.

Encourage patients to attend their next scheduled follow-up in-clinic for device reprogramming (if necessary). Programming all high voltage therapies to 40J with a B>AX pathway and Active Can/SVC Coil set with Active Can enabled across all therapy zones. A software update to correct the issue will be available in late 2022. Another in-clinic follow-up will be needed when the software update is available so it can be installed into a patient’s device. The update will ensure the full shock energy is delivered in the presence of a secondary low-level current pathway in the high voltage circuitry.

Be aware the following are signs that a short circuit alert is a result of a reduced-energy shock and not a problem with a device’s leads If the delivered energy during the episode is ~79% of the programmed energy AND the SCP alert indicates an RV Defib Lead impedance alert reporting exactly zero (0) ohms this is an indication of a second-phase SCP event (as described in this letter) and not a lead issue.

Contact Medtronic Technical Services (1-800-723-4636) or your local representative if an RV Defib Lead Impedance Alert reporting zero (0) ohms is observed. This is an indicator that an SCP event was detected during HV therapy. Consider device replacement only after observing and confirming the cause of an SCP event with a Medtronic representative.

Note that several device functions are not impacted after an SCP alert: Pacing Sensing Episode detection Anti-tachycardia pacing therapies High voltage charging Battery longevity Bluetooth telemetry

At the time of his ban from Meta's platforms Tate had amassed over 4.7 million followers on Instagram.

Bans from Facebook and Instagram mean the former kickboxer turned multimillionaire influencer is now de-platformed from the big three social media platforms. He was banned from Twitter in 2016 after stating women should ""bear responsibility"" for being sexually assaulted. Meta banned Tate for violating its policies on “dangerous organizations and individuals"" The Guardian confirmed.

Tate's videos — which are cartoonishly misogynistic —amassed a large amount of attention this summer due to their controversial and over-the-top nature and their ubiquity. Tate's questionable source of income appears to involve inducing customers at his ""Hustler's University"" business to create social media accounts clipping short vignettes from Tate's podcast and interview appearances and dispersing them to as many people as possible.

What appeared to have been Tate's official Tiktok account has been banned for quite some time now but his various fan accounts on TikTok have hundreds of thousands of followers. The #andrewtate hashtag alone has 13.4 billion views on Tiktok. A spokesperson with Tiktok told The Guardian that the platform has been ""removing violative videos and accounts for weeks and welcome[s] the news that other platforms are also taking action against this individual.""

In a statement to The Guardian Tate told the outlet that most of his videos are parody and that ""Internet sensationalism has purported the idea that I'm anti-women when nothing could be further from the truth."" Tate appeared with popular Twitch streamer Adin Ross and spoke about the claims further. He stated that everything said about him was a false narrative created by people who dislike him.

""What they've done is found all the little clips across six years of content a total of three or four minutes and are trying to make it look like I'm out there trying to hate on women when I'm the one out here donating to women trying to prove that my influence has an effect and that I need to be very very careful with it"" Tate said on Ross' stream. ""It's a truly false narrative."" Tate has so far been unapologetic about the many controversial statements that he claims are being used to construct this supposedly false narrative.

The UK advocacy group Hope Not Hate told the BBC that Tate is a “dangerous misogynist” and called on more social media companies to deplatform him. Joe Mulhall director of research at the group told the BBC that ""Mr. Tate poses a genuine threat to young men radicalizing them towards extremism misogyny racism and homophobia.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vc2xhdGUuY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvMjAyMi8wOC9tYXJrLXp1Y2tlcmJlcmctbWV0YXZlcnNlLWhvcml6b24td29ybGRzLWZhY2Vib29rLWxvb2tzLWNyYXBweS1leHBsYWluZWQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mark Zuckerberg's metaverse demo of Horizon Worlds looks so crappy for a reason.,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='slate.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /technology/2022/08/mark-zuckerberg-metaverse-horizon-worlds-facebook-looks-crappy-explained.html (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159B89813F0>, 'Connection to slate.com timed out.

Through sublime singles meat dresses at MTV Video Music Awards egg hatchings at the Grammys an Oscar win duets with Tony Bennett and oh so so much more Gaga has (purposefully) muddied that mantra.

Gaga’s current tour – The Chromatica Ball which stopped at Fenway Park on Friday night – does get back to the dancing. But instead of just dance it’s dance and think dance and cry dance and marvel at the P. T. Barnum-on-acid spectacle of it all. And in its best moments it’s sit down and just listen.

Like in the past with Gaga that spectacle can threaten to crowd out the pop. Towers of fog a dozen dancers video screens as tall as the Green Monster more pyro than Motley Crue Gaga singing while enveloped in a cocoon straight out of Tron and stuck on a slowly rotating lazy Susan. This was the first song “Bad Romance.”

The spectacle was one of the biggest boldest ever put on in Fenway. But it only works because it stands on such glorious music. In a tiny club or eyes closed these songs make you shake your hips. Early on Gaga crammed the set with thumpers: “Just Dance” (naturally) into “Poker Face” three of the top boogie tracks from new album “Chromatica” crammed together (“Alice” Replay” and “Monster”) and the banging double shot of “Telephone” and “LoveGame.”

The hour-plus of the two hour show leaned hard into the dance party. It seemed she’d forgotten her deeply introspective stuff – sadly tracks from “Joanne” were nowhere to be found. Then Gaga sat down at a piano – on a mini stage on the field right where Dustin Pedroia used to stand – and abandoned the disco enormity.

Coming out of “Babylon” a track that screams out to be compared to Madonna’s “Express Yourself” Gaga proved (once again) why the Madonna comparisons are tiring (if not flattering). Minus the video walls fire and lasers without the backing tracks and poor pacing that comes with costume changes every four songs Gaga and 35000 little monsters got intimate with her songs.

She transformed “Born This Way” into a piano power ballad. She delivered all the tenderness “Shallow” demands. She awesomely took “1000 Doves” – another one of those slamming club tracks from “Chromatica” – and restored it to what it was when she wrote it: a melodically magnetic lyrically vulnerable little gem framing one of pop’s all time great voices (the range! the force! the visceral magic of it!).

Gaga returned to the bombastic dance numbers – “Stupid Love” and “Rain on Me” standing out and reminding everyone that “Chromatica” is a killer LP. But it’s key that she always indulges that part of her that doesn’t want to just dance that wants to just listen.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55ZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzIwL2dyaWRsb2NrLXNhbS1hLWJpZy1sb2NhbC1zcG9ydHMtd2Vlay1tZWFucy10cmFmZmljL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GRIDLOCK SAM: A big local sports week means traffic,"Sunday Aug. 21- Saturday Aug. 27

Dear Gridlock Sam

The exit off the Long Island Expressway at Van Dam St. has people constantly pushing their way into the people waiting in the proper lanes. They even get all the way up to the exit and intimidate to get in. Something has to be done; I think there should be a traffic camera at these exits to take photos and issue tickets similar to red light cameras and speed and bus lane cameras.

Joe

Dear Joe

I hate “cheaters.” That’s what I call drivers who go to the very end of a long line of cars and cross over the channelization (hatched lines). The Van Dam exit is one of the worst locations in the city because it is the last exit before the toll at the Queens Midtown Tunnel.

Once congestion pricing goes into effect there will no longer be an incentive for drivers to hop off at Van Dam unless they have a local destination. Until then I’ve asked NYPD to enforce the rule but even then I don’t see the problem eliminated. The legislation for cameras doesn’t extend to crossing channelization but maybe it should. Readers?

Time is our most valuable asset. Bakers balance many responsibilities while running their operations so finding any spare moment to slow down take a step back and consider whether they can improve their methods for conducting daily tasks is not something that comes along very often. But when an opportunity presents itself to help you take back your time not only can it improve the efficiency of your operation but it can also become a catalyst to positively influence others throughout your organization and the entire baking community.

For the R&D team at Puratos Serbia—a division within the global Puratos family of business units serving the bakery and patisserie producers—time is always at a premium. The team is responsible for developing powdered products used in baking and oversees the development and quality control for Puratos’ extensive line of semi-finished baked product mixes. The Puratos company produces hundreds of pre-mixed baked product recipes including pan bread buns rolls and patisserie products.

Many food-producing companies from industrial producers large restaurant chains to cafes rely on mixes from Puratos Serbia so they can provide a variety of freshly baked products to their customers on a daily basis. Each mix is distributed with all ingredients in exact ratios to produce a particular baked product easily and efficiently.

“As a producer of high-quality product mixes we need to have a full view of everything that is actually going into our products” says Ivana Aničić R&D manager for Puratos Serbia. ""Our customers simply take our mixes pour water add yeast and begin their baking process. It is up to us to ensure that our products meet their consumer’s expectations with each mix we distribute.”

Because they are the main line of defense for products design and quality Puratos Serbia spends significant time conducting baking trials on their products in their Innovation Center and QC lab. In the past with each new flour batch the team would run several baking trials on a specific product tweaking their recipes as needed before finding a ratio of flour and ingredients that was on-brand for product expectations. Each additional round of testing leads to more time lost and spent ingredients impacting the company's bottom line.

What makes a good baked protein mix?

Like any baked product recipe developing a product mix is a trial and error process to find the right balance of ingredients enzymes improvers and other recipe components. However even if all other variables are controlled to the finest detail one element in a baked product mix can offset the entire process: flour quality.

For practical reasons due to rising wheat prices millers are more likely to make their raw wheat purchase from their suppliers based on cost rather than quality. However this produces a trickle-down effect where final product quality can suffer and reflect poorly on a baking operation.

Flour quality is typically measured based on the availability of a few standard quality parameters. Protein content has traditionally been a priority for baking operations but amylase activity and dough rheology (water absorption and dough behavior) among others also factor into flour quality.

Determining whether a flour batch is ""good"" or ""bad"" is not always a straightforward answer. Certain types of flour are better suited to produce one kind of product over another (e.g. the flour used for pizza dough may not offer the same properties to make crackers). Also regional tastes or expectations for a specific baked product may factor into the flour selection (e.g. a baguette produced in France may have a different texture or crust than one made in China).

Another variable is the availability of high-quality flour within a specific region. Many regions import their flour from parts of the world that may not have access to advanced wheat harvesting or flour milling equipment and storage which also presents additional challenges when assessing this vital ingredient.

To truly understand how a batch of flour will adapt to a particular product bakers are left with few options other than putting the flour through the baking process analyzing results and adjusting as needed.





Discovery of a new method to interpret baking trial results

While baking trials provide the outcome of the production process they can sometimes prompt more questions than answers. Rarely is there clear reasoning as to how or why the results occurred the way they did from one trial to the next leading the baker to rely on subjective interpretation.

In 2020—at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic—the R&D team at Puratos Serbia used the lockdown to return to their roots reintroducing themselves to the science of baking. With so much product variation that would often occur during their trials the team began researching new methods to help reduce the subjectivity in their R&D and quality assurance programs for their product mixes.

Through these efforts they discovered the CHOPIN Technologies Mixolab 2: a universal dough characterization tool bakers use to simulate their baking process in a fraction of the time and ingredients involved with baking trials. As an all-in-one instrument Mixolab 2 collects information on flour or mixes' water absorption mixing behavior gluten resistance to heating viscosity amylase activity and other processes to present the results in a data curve.

“We started our journey with this dough characterizer as a pioneer within the Puratos group” says Aničić. ""We would typically send the flour samples to an external lab to make rheological analyses adding more steps to our quality control protocol. We realized to bring this analysis in-house we could help improve our operations in many ways.”

The Puratos Serbia team first began by analyzing incoming flour to gain a preliminary understanding of what is happening during the baking process. The team then began introducing functional ingredients to the process including enzymes emulsifiers and others to see how those variables could influence their data curve.

As R&D team member Nemanja Mandic recalled these preliminary trials led to a breakthrough moment for him and Puratos Serbia. ""We began to perform trials in parallel with our baking trials using the same ingredients in the mix and water content ratios. From there we realized that we could match our baking trial result with the output from the instrument which would help us apply quantifiable data to determine whether any variations could have affected final product results.”

“When you match product result with the curve from the instrument you have a benchmark for what the 'ideal' product should look like. This is information we never had access to before"" says Mandic.

The product database building begins

One-by-one the Puratos Serbia team began building “profiles” for the company’s many product mixes. As Aničić states the database building project has been a lot of work but Puratos Serbia has realized paybacks for their efforts in many different ways.

""We have run thousands of analyses spending a lot of time trying to crosslink our baking trial results with our dough characterizer"" says Aničić. “But this process has allowed us to obtain a baseline expectation for how a particular flour will impact the quality of a specific product. Now we have a much clearer idea of flour quality and make corrective adjustments to our mix recipes before we even begin a baking trial. This process has proven to be repeatable and saved our operations costs in both R&D and quality control efforts.""

Armed with a ""dough interpreter"" Puratos Serbia shares experiences and insights

Puratos Serbia team's efforts have not gone unnoticed by their parent company. After sharing their successes the team began collaborating with others in the organization to help solve quality control challenges they frequently encounter.

Assessing causes of wholemeal wheat flour quality variations

In this experiment Puratos Serbia tested 15 different flour samples from their local mill in order to try and determine how there could be such significant variations in their final products. These flour samples were collected from different harvests at different points from May 2020 until March 2021.

After running each flour sample through their flour profiling process the team noticed that the flour's gelatinization amylase activity and retrogradation readings (relating to product shelf life) displayed significant variations from one sample to the next. ""For us it's a big problem if you have viscosity and amylase index variations. It can lead to poor structure poor fermentation and other issues so this was very useful for our team to see"" says Mandic.

Most importantly this exercise demonstrated how important it is to make flour quality analysis an essential part of a quality control regimen. ""With this data we have a better idea of what to expect from our flour quality not just from different regions of the world but from different harvests throughout the year” says Aničić. “In fact we can use these flour quality benchmarks to effectively see when our miller is switching their product from one harvest to the next. The dough characterizer helps us see whether our flour is behaving oddly then correct our mix to compensate the product or send our delivery back to the supplier.”

Enhancing data from texture analysis

The texture is a crucial measure of quality for many baked products. As an additional step in their quality assurance program Puratos Serbia uses a Texture Analyzer to quantify the textural characteristics of their products after baking trials.

With each flour test that same data can also align with the results from their Texture Analyzer.

""When we have a project relating to analyzing freshness from products like toast or buns we perform parallel tests with our dough characterizer then align the Texture Analyzer results from the products produced from our baking trials"" says Aničić. ""This gives us objective results relating to the finished product characteristics including mouth feel resilience short bite and others and we combine those results into our protocol.""

Improving communication with suppliers and customers

Quality assurance is also at the forefront in all of Puratos Serbia’s business transactions—whether purchasing flour from their miller or working with a customer to solve a specific challenge.

Recently Puratos Serbia has begun using their dough characterizer as a flour quality verification tool with one of its millers. This miller who owns the same instrument submits their flour delivery along with a datasheet of readings from the dough characterizer. The Puratos Serbia team will still conduct their trials on the new flour to ensure their results are comparable with their miller. This process has significantly reduced any of their flour delivery rejections from this supplier says Aničić.

""When we communicate with our customers that we own Mixolab 2 as our tool we usually present it as something that gives us full insight on raw materials and our final products. It gives our brand security that our customers trust while allowing us to develop customized product solutions to serve their consumer's demands"" says Aničić.

Leading the way to improve quality control methods within Puratos

Puratos Serbia continues to lead many company-wide quality assurance efforts within the Puratos organization. While still in the process of developing product profiles for each of the company's vast and growing product line the team is also leading educational efforts within the company all to improve quality through every step of their process.

""Before any of these efforts it was like a fog when assessing flour quality for a particular baking mix"" says Aničić. “Now we have much clearer methods that have helped us reduce baking trials and focus our efforts to help our colleagues and customers solve their challenges relating to flour or dough quality analysis.”

And the same holds true for dining at a favorite restaurant where a revamped menu brings the thrill of discovery. At The Mayfair Supper Club both of those happened in recent weeks when not only a new show debuted but several dishes joined a cast of favorites.

The show was conceived by No Ceilings Entertainment the creators of Mayfair’s first production and brings an updated concept characters and songs. During the evening you’ll meet Mae Montgomery a powerhouse voice portrayed by Claire Souliér and her counterpart Fred Lowell played by Jason Martinez. They are joined by four dancers piano drums bass trombone—it’s the whole package. “The new production maintains everything audiences love about The Mayfair’s vibe with a completely fresh entertainment experience” said Ari Kastrati MGM Resorts International’s chief hospitality officer in a release when the new show was introduced.

The performance begins a little after 7 p.m. and we recommend you try for a reservation around that time. You’ll be ushered into the environs of The Mayfair Supper Club a long room with plush booths tucked along two sides a bar at one end and a central area with tables and the performance stage. Behind that a wall of arches frames another dining area that looks out onto the Fountains of Bellagio an attraction that provides a secondary show throughout the night.

As your decadent delicious drinks the Copacabana with SelvaRey silver rum pineapple and coconut and the Lola with Awayuki strawberry gin lychee and mint arrive you’ll notice activity all over the restaurant. Aerialists twist on hoops in several places in the dining room pearl-draped ladies sidle along the aisles and sequined-suited gentlemen hang out on the railings.

Soon the show performers make their way to the stage as you make your way through the hamachi crudo a delicate bite with thin slivers of calamansi and Fresno chili; you learn that Montgomery and Lowell were friends who have reunited for a final performance (Adam North wrote the underlying story).

As you work your way through the heirloom tomato with olives and cured lemon Souliér and Martinez work their way through songs such as “Crazy Little Thing Called Love.” Before you the decadent wagyu handroll arrives anointed with caviar wasabi soy glaze and gold leaf; the performers are anointed with glamorous costumes in bright pink red gold and metallic colors; every movement reminds you of another era when glam evening wear was everything.

There are a surprising number of musical genres represented in the show from jazz to postmodern jukebox interpretations. While you’re waiting for your entrée Souliér regales you with “Ex’s & Oh’s” joined by two talented female dancers whose energy is incredible. Sushi dishes are slid before you and the vegetarian tiger roll makes a lovely bite. Choreographers Dean Lee Keo Motsepe and Shannon Mather all with extensive pedigrees of working with top singers and dance series developed the dance numbers.

You’ll adore Martinez’ team-up with the talented pianist for an energetic version of “Twist and Shout.” Garlic-crusted prime rib slow roasted for 10 hours does not last so long on the plate. For a close-up bit of magic whole Dover sole is delivered via cart and deboned tableside and served with a caviar beurre blanc sauce. The Weeknd’s “Blinding Lights” and Prince’s “Purple Rain” are delivered with equal amounts of deep-seated feeling by Souliér as you wait for vegetarian pappardelle in a rosy pomodoro sauce with gremolata and burrata atop. Etta James’ “At Last” rings out as the Ōra King salmon arrives to the table.

Dessert deserves a special part in this evening and as a conga line wends its way through the dining room bringing smiles to everyone who remembers Harry Belafonte’s “Jump In the Line” another cart rolls on up and your server proceeds to bring a cherries jubilee to life through the medium of fire. On the table a hickory smoke-filled glass dome conceals the Cigar an edible chocolate and hazelnut cigar showpiece from which wafts an intoxicating aroma. And the soft-serve sundae dominates the little space left with a variety of toppings that give you a perfect moment.

There’s so much happening during your evening that there’s no way to catch it all; you’ll surely have to schedule a return trip. Said No Ceilings Entertainment co-founder Dennis Jauch “We’re honored to have so many guests return to The Mayfair time and again—they have become regulars and we love it. Whether you are a fan or a first timer to Mayfair this production will make for an incredible night out.”

And if you can’t swing a dinner date do not despair. The Mayfair Supper Club brings a nightlife vibe to Friday and Saturday nights with Mayfair After Dark a wildly delicious lounge-style experience that runs until late in the evening. “We’ll continue delivering ‘wow’ moments and creating memories for everyone who walks through our doors” said Kastrati.

They’re used in computers machinery phones and many other electronics and appliances we use on a daily basis. Of course various metal parts and components are integral to the manufacturing of these microchips. How has the microchip industry been impacted by current global events? Moreover what does the future hold for US microchip supplies?

Microchips in the Automotive Industry

A recent article noted how a global surge in automobile prices caused a huge spike in microchip demand. This proved one major catalyst for worldwide microchip shortages. With advances in automotive technology especially in the growth of EV vehicles this assumption doesn’t sound farfetched.

However technological advancements continue to happen all the time. As a result microchips and commodities like silicon which go into manufacturing them will continue to grow in demand.

US and China Race Taiwan with Microchip Technology

Currently Taiwan remains one of the world’s top manufacturers of microchips and semiconductors. However US manufacturers are trying to catch up to Taiwan’s microchip production rate. That said currently the US produces only about 12% of the world’s microchip supplies.

These valuable components are incredibly difficult to manufacture not just for the US but for most nations. Computer chips and semiconductors consist of numerous delicate layers of silicon with labyrinths of patterns between them. Because of this manufacturing these crucial parts is not only time consuming but also expensive.

Taiwan manages to produce an abundance of microchips partially in thanks to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd. one of the world’s top chip producers. The country also excels at semiconductor manufacturing technologies making it a major player in the global microchip industry.

Some speculate that this makes Taiwan a target for China as many Chinese microchip parts come from Taiwan. Therefore if any type of conflict were to occur involving Taiwan it could lead to immediate global ramifications in the microchip industry.

Make sure you are following the 5 best practices of sourcing silicon and other metals.

US Making Strides

Recently President Biden signed a microchip bill aimed at bolstering the US microchip industry. After all since the early 1990’s the US’ microchip and semiconductor manufacturing industries have been cut in half. Difficulties with manufacturing as noted above are a huge contributor to this. That’s why the goal of this new bill is to jump-start the US’ semiconductor manufacturing efforts once again.

Yet another layer of incentive can be found in the new bill. It states that companies who invest in microchip manufacturing facilities will receive a 25% tax credit. Despite the good news moving semiconductor manufacturing into the US will come with challenges. For instance microchip manufacturing like many industries saw a significant slow down with the pandemic. This caused a temporary halt in technological advancements. Of course supply chain shortages have not helped.

Still issues like this are ones which the new bill strives to minimize. Hopefully the new bill will easy microchip shortages and aid the US in catching up to Taiwan in the new race for microchip manufacturing dominance.

Market Lifecycle Stage

There has been a constant shift in the satellite's electronic technologies due to the increased demand for small satellites. Extensive research has been conducted on new global information networks and electronic information management systems to improve the satellite's efficiency and cost and size reduction. The space industry has embraced commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components which provide efficient radiation shielding without compromising the quality. COTS components are used to reduce costs and the development time of space electronics.

Several projects are currently in progress to produce advanced commercial-off-the-shelf components with enhanced capability to shield space perturbations at low cost which are expected to increase with the launch of upcoming mega-constellations as well as with the rising COTS demand is ubiquitously profitable for the component developing companies since the demand for customization in the COTS components is least for such mission profiles and ""as it is"" components are more preferred.

The satellite operators are trying to deploy components of lower screening levels more quickly and cheaply than the conventional qualified manufacturing list (QML). This involves anything from pure plastic-packaged COTS parts all the way to screening just below QML or sub-QML levels. As a result the market for satellite commercial-off-the-shelf components is well-established.

Impact

The increasing number of satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) with the upcoming mega-constellation has placed a high demand for the production of satellite commercial-off-the-shelf components during the forecast period.

Furthermore rising demand for reconfigurable satellite payloads has resulted in the need for miniaturized satellite commercial-off-the-shelf components to support complex missions for significantly longer periods.

Samsung Electronics Co. the world’s top memory chipmaker plans to spend 20 trillion won ($15.1 billion) by 2028 on an advanced semiconductor research and development complex to secure a competitive edge in an intensifying battle against rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC).Samsung on Friday broke ground for the complex in Giheung Yongin about 50 kilometers south of Seoul earmarked for key R&D in its memory fabless system semiconductors foundry and other sectors. The company is poised to operate a dedicated production line for the R&D center from 2025.“We begin a new challenge on the Giheung campus where the first shovel hit the ground 40 years ago to build a semiconductor factory” Samsung Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee said in the groundbreaking ceremony with the slogan “We create the future with technology that does not exist in the world.”“We need super excellent technology that can lead the global market without being hit by a crisis” Lee stressed in his first public appearance since he has had his right to work restored.

US Micron Technology Inc. last month announced mass production of the world’s first 232-layer NAND chip while China's Yangtze Memory Technologies (YMTC) said it has delivered samples of its in-house developed 192-layer 3D NAND flash memory to a few customers.Vice Chairman Lee decided to develop technologies to overcome those issues.“The US and China cannot directly put pressure on Samsung because it has technology and production capabilities” said an industry source. “Samsung has no choice but to maintain its technological leadership.”Cutting-edge technologies helped Samsung control global markets. Samsung kept the throne in the memory chip sector with the DDR5 DRAM which has doubled the performance compared to the DDR4. The prices of DDR5 products were immune to the recent drops in the overall DRAM prices as the models were suitable for artificial intelligence and machine learning drawing strong demand. Samsung currently led the DDR5 DRAM market.South Korea the home to Samsung and the world’s No. 2 memory chipmaker SK Hynix Inc. has been relatively passive in semiconductor technology investments.Samsung last year spent $6.5 billion on R&D for the semiconductor business less than half of the $15.2 billion of Intel Corp. according to the industry research firm IC Insights.The South Korean tech behemoth aims to quickly catch up with TSMC the global foundry leader with the investment in the R&D complex. Samsung was known to narrow the gap with the Taiwanese maker in the sector for below 10-nanometer process nodes. Samsung’s technologies on the 3-nm process node the industry’s narrowest circuitry are superior to those of TSMC. Samsung plans to manufacture products below 3 nm sooner improving its competitiveness.Samsung the country’s largest company by market capitalization aims to build the new R&D complex as a state-of-the-art facility for future semiconductor technologies.The planned exclusive fab for the R&D center in the complex is expected to shorten the development period and improve product quality industry sources said.“The dedicated production line to the R&D with cutting-edge equipment will allow researchers to conduct various experiments more freely and actively” said one of the sources.The R&D complex is expected to help the local semiconductor industry’s ecosystem leap to the next level as it provides a wide range of foundations for delicate and comprehensive research that cover the technologies of each sector.The semiconductor industry needs systematic and collaborative developments in each field including design materials equipment components process and inspection.

Following our D-Bus blog post that focused on Linux we searched for similar D-Bus patterns on other platforms by auditing D-Bus services and their handler code. After locating a local memory corruption issue we discovered the vulnerability could be remotely triggered by manipulating audio metadata. Attackers could have lured users into meeting these conditions such as by simply playing a new song in a browser or from a paired Bluetooth device or leveraged adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) capabilities to exploit the vulnerability remotely.

After carefully reviewing the implications a Microsoft security researcher shared the vulnerability with Google in April 2022 and also reported it with the Chromium bug tracking system. Fixes for the vulnerability which is assigned as CVE-2022-2587 and has a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score of 9.8 (classifying the vulnerability as critical) were quickly released and have been successfully deployed to end users. We’d like to thank the Google team and the Chromium community for their professional resolution and collaborative efforts.

This research coupled with the recent release of ChromeOS Flex which can convert various legacy PCs and Macs into Chromebooks emphasizes the importance of analyzing and monitoring security for devices running ChromeOS. Moreover as even the most hardened operating systems might contain security bugs we emphasize the need for strong monitoring of all cross-platform devices and operating systems. The best approach for protecting unmanaged devices is by using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint’s device discovery capabilities to monitor suspicious traffic and help detect attacker activities on such devices.

In this blog post we share some information about the vulnerability and examine how it could be triggered as well as the possible implications. Displaying how our cross-domain expertise helps us uncover new and unknown threats in the effort to continually improve security for all we also share details from our research with the larger security community to emphasize the importance of collaboration to secure platforms and devices.

An overview of ChromeOS security

One well-known operating system that uses D-Bus is ChromeOS. ChromeOS is a Google-proprietary Linux-based operating system that runs on Chromebooks Chromeboxes Chromebits and Chromebases. ChromeOS is a closed-source system with open-source components that are derived from ChromiumOS and the operating system uses Google’s own Chrome browser as its principal user interface.

In terms of security ChromeOS is well hardened; some of the security features on ChromeOS include:

Hardened sandbox (called minijail)

Verified boot

Locked-down filesystem (mounted with noexec nosuid nodev) and dm-verity

Root user restrictions (SECURE_NOROOT)

When development mode is entered all locally stored data is wiped

As with other modern browsers exploiting ChromeOS usually requires chaining vulnerabilities together. Due to hardening measures in ChromeOS discovering vulnerabilities became a specific niche and therefore the number of public vulnerabilities is quite low compared to other operating systems. ChromeOS vulnerabilities generally fall into one of three different classes:

ChromeOS-specific logic vulnerabilities ChromeOS-specific memory-corruption vulnerabilities Broader threats such as Chrome browser vulnerabilities

In this case the discovered vulnerability falls under the second class ChromeOS-specific memory-corruption vulnerabilities.

Bug hunting

Having discussed and extensively researched D-Bus we continued this analysis by enumerating the D-Bus services offered on ChromeOS. In general D-Bus is an Inter-Process-Communication (IPC) mechanism that’s popular on desktop platforms specifically Linux.

ChromeOS’s developer mode offers the dbus-send utility to send messages over D-bus. As there are many D-Bus services offered on ChromeOS (usually identified by the “org.chromium” prefix) we automated the process and used the dbus-send utility to fetch the full tree of services and their exported methods and signals.

Because most D-Bus services support the org.freedesktop.DBus.Introspectable interface it’s possible to dynamically fetch exported methods and signals without reading the source code or reverse-engineering the binaries.

Fetching all the exported service names can be performed using the following command:

dbus-send --system --dest=org.freedesktop.DBus --type=method_call --print-reply /org/freedesktop/DBus org.freedesktop.DBus.ListNames

Using org.chromium.ResourceManager as an example each service can then be enumerated for its declared methods and signals via the following command:

dbus-send --system --dest=org.chromium.ResourceManager --type=method_call --print-reply /org/chromium/ResourceManager org.freedesktop.DBus.Introspectable.Introspect

Considering that the more input a method receives the higher the probability of finding a security issue we then focused on methods that export arbitrarily large inputs such as strings or arrays. It wasn’t long before we found an interesting service: org.chromium.cras.

The vulnerability

The org.chromium.cras D-Bus name is owned by CRAS (ChromiumOS Audio Server) which has a well-documented architecture under the ChromiumOS wiki pages. In essence CRAS is a server that resides between the operating system and ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) as a means of routing audio to newly attached audio-supporting peripherals like USB speakers and Bluetooth headsets.

Reviewing the exported methods uncovered one method with a particularly interesting handling function: SetPlayerIdentity which gets one string (an argument called identity) as an input. Since ChromiumOS is open-sourced tracking the calls is straightforward:

In cras_dbus_control.c the handler function for SetPlayerIdentity is handle_set_player_identity which extracts the identity argument from the D-Bus message and invoke the cras_bt_player_update_identity function. In cras_bt_player.c the function cras_bt_player_update_identity that was called checks that the identity input value is not null and is different than the current player identity string (saved under player.identity). If so it copies the identity variable to player.identity using the C library function strcpy. Of note “player” is a global variable in the cras_bt_player module and includes an identity field in it among others.

To the experienced security engineer the mention of the strcpy function immediately raises red flags. The strcpy function is known to cause various memory corruption vulnerabilities since it doesn’t perform any bounds check and is therefore considered unsafe. As there are no bounds checks on the user-supplied identity argument before invoking strcpy (besides the default message length limitations for D-Bus messages) we were confident we could trigger a heap-based buffer overflow therefore triggering a memory corruption vulnerability.

Heap-based buffer overflows can be the cause of multiple vulnerabilities most notoriously leading to arbitrary code execution through various means. This could include overriding a function callback in an allocated object or overriding chunk metadata which can trigger other unexpected behavior during the lifetime of a program.

Checking how the player.identity string is initialized shows that it’s set in the cras_bt_player_init function as the result of malloc(128) which means it’s allocated on the user’s heap with 128 bytes.

Figure 1. The vulnerable function with the strcpy invocation in it

Therefore the vulnerability could be triggered using a single command line by sending the identity user-controlled D-Bus argument with more than 128 bytes as displayed in our example code below:

dbus-send --system --dest=org.chromium.cras --type=method_call --print-reply /org/chromium/cras org.chromium.cras.Control.SetPlayerIdentity string:AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

As most users don’t need to enable ChromeOS’s developer mode and thus can’t use the dbus-send utility our next task was to find a way to trigger the bug without using developer mode.

Triggering the bug remotely

Thinking we spotted a local memory corruption issue we wanted to better understand how to trigger the bug. Since the involved functions exclusively get triggered from D-Bus we looked for functions that trigger the SetPlayerIdentity D-Bus method—if the arguments to those don’t have bounds checks then those functions could be used to trigger the vulnerability.

Examining the open-source ChromiumOS repositories found that the CRAS audio client invokes the SetPlayerIdentity method (and exports a function with the same name). In turn it’s called by the CRAS audio handler component’s method MediaSessionMetadataChanged which extracts the identity from a metadata structure representing a song’s title:

Figure 2. SetPlayerIdentity triggered from metadata changes

At this point it was clear that the vulnerability could be triggered via changes to the audio metadata. Looking for MediaSessionMetadataChanged invocations revealed two interesting cases that could both be triggered remotely:

From the browser: the browser’s media component invokes the function when metadata is changed such as when playing a new song in the browser. From Bluetooth: the media session service in the operating system invokes the function when a song’s metadata changes which can happen when playing a new song from a paired Bluetooth device.

Figure 3. Call tree displaying how browser or Bluetooth media metadata changes ultimately trigger the vulnerable function

Implications and reporting

We reported the vulnerability to Google in April 2022 as a part of the Chromium bug tracking system and were assigned Issue 1320917 which immediately got assigned as a priority 1 security bug. In parallel we tracked the issue internally in Microsoft Security Vulnerability Research (MSVR) while using OSINT to look for indications of that vulnerability being used in the wild. We did not find any indications of in-the-wild exploitation.

The impact of heap-based buffer overflow ranges from simple DoS to full-fledged RCE. Although it’s possible to allocate and free chunks through media metadata manipulation performing the precise heap-grooming is not trivial in this case and attackers would need to chain the exploit with other vulnerabilities to successfully execute any arbitrary code. Given the potential impact of the vulnerability coupled with the fact that it could be remotely triggered it’s a security risk that justifies the bug priority and how fast the fix was issued.

We were impressed with the speed of the fix and the effectiveness of the overall process. Within less than a week the code was committed and after several merges made generally available to users. We thank the Google team and the Chromium community for their efforts in addressing the issue.

Improving security for all through research and threat intelligence sharing

As the threat and computing landscape continues to evolve Microsoft strives to continuously improve security for all through research-driven protections and collaboration with customers partners and industry experts regardless of the device or platform in use.

To defend against the evolving threat landscape organizations must closely monitor all devices and operating systems across platforms including unmanaged devices. Unmanaged devices are sometimes ignored or missed by security teams at join time making them attractive targets for compromising quietly performing lateral movements jumping network boundaries and achieving persistence for the sake of launching broader attacks. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint’s device discovery capabilities help organizations find certain unmanaged devices including those running ChromeOS and can detect if they are being operated by attackers when they start performing network interactions with servers and other managed devices.

Microsoft security researchers continually work to discover new vulnerabilities and threats turning knowledge of a variety of wide-reaching issues into improved solutions that protect users and organizations across platforms every single day. This case displays how vulnerability disclosures and threat intelligence sharing are essential to effectively mitigate issues and protect users against present and future threats. Moreover by expanding upon our prior research we can also continue to make positive contributions to the overall security of devices worldwide even on platforms we currently don’t directly support.

In a video released by Oracle at the time of its breakthrough multi-cloud announcement with Microsoft last month Carter offered some compelling perspectives in the broader context of FedEx’s overall business and the impact that the new multi-cloud agreement will have.

The endorsement from the highly regarded Carter is a big boost for what Oracle and Microsoft hope to achieve with their new multi-cloud offering which was announced last month with considerable fanfare in a video conversation between Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Oracle chairman Larry Ellison.

As I remarked at the time the Oracle-Microsoft collaboration is more than just a tech agreement between two big companies. Instead I believe it will trigger a new wave of customer expectations and demands for all cloud providers to step up the level of seamless interoperability and blended capabilities as Oracle and Microsoft have put together. You can see my analyses of this far-reaching joint announcement in:

To those far-reaching visions from two of the world’s top brains we can now add the thoughts of FedEx’s Carter who’s been with the company for almost 30 years and has won in his 15+ years as CIO every conceivable award and recognition.

You can watch the two-minute video to hear Carter’s comments in the context of some intriguing visuals and here’s a transcript of his remarks — set off in italics and quotation marks — sprinkled with a few comments and reactions of my own.

FedEx CIO Executive VP Rob Carter on the Oracle-Microsoft Multi-Cloud

“FedEx connects the world. We have more than 700 aircraft 200000 service vehicles and a half-million team members all over the world who connect people and possibilities.

“Data is the first-class citizen when we look at our technology stack these days. Having access to data in multiple clouds is really something we’ve always wanted.” My reaction: I suspect every CIO in the world has had that same aspiration but FedEx has been out in front of most businesses in becoming a data-driven digital powerhouse in parallel with its vast physical-world capabilities.

FedEx Executive VP Rob Carter

“We’ve deployed a lot of technology into both OCI [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure] and Azure. For many years we’ve deployed Oracle databases as a key part of our data strategy. We’ve been doing a lot of analytics these days in Azure. What this allows us to do is bring the two so much closer together.” My comment: In the old world a database vendor might have said “I’ll be damned if I’m going to do anything to help my customers use somebody else’s analytics tools in my database.” But that old-world thinking will prove deadly in the world of the customer-centric cloud.

“We’ve always believed in a multi-cloud architecture that allows us to put the right data and technology in the right cloud at the right time. It’s a value-creation capability that’s serving us really well all around the world.” My comment: these two sentences should be the foundation for every CIO’s strategy around multi-cloud.

“We’ve put platform services to work that allow us to move workloads around to the most-appropriate most-economical and highest-value implementation.” My comment: customers are putting a premium on choice flexibility and freedom — and there will be no going back on these requirements.

“The future is always a little unknown. Having multi-cloud capabilities really allows us to adapt quickly to whatever circumstances the world and the marketplaces bring to us.” My comment: adaptability and speed flexibility and freedom—those are the new imperatives in the cloud.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlZWt3aXJlLmNvbS8yMDIyL2hvdy1taWNyb3NvZnRzLWFpLWNvbnZpbmNlZC1tZS10by1zd2l0Y2gtdG8tZWRnZS1hbmQtd2hlcmUtdGhlLWJyb3dzZXItc3RpbGwtZmFsbHMtc2hvcnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Microsoft's AI convinced me to switch to Edge and where the browser still falls short,"Microsoft’s Edge browser comes with a built-in “Read aloud” feature. (GeekWire Illustration)

I finally broke down and switched to Microsoft’s Edge browser this week on my Windows PC after many years of using Google Chrome.

No it wasn’t the incessant and annoying prompts in Windows 11 urging me to make Edge my default although the nagging did keep the Microsoft browser top of mind.

For me the tipping point was Edge’s built-in “Read aloud” feature and what sounds to my ears like major advances in some of Microsoft’s synthesized voices to the point that they’re almost indistinguishable from human narrators.

I’ve long been a fan of text-to-speech for listening to articles and long emails.

Combined with wireless headphones or earbuds it’s a great way to get up from your desk and do something else (clean the room stretch brush your teeth etc.) while the text is being read.

When writing or editing the extra step of listening to the audio helps me catch missing or errant words or notice awkward sentences I might otherwise miss.

In a world of distractions following along with the text as it’s being read is one way of improving focus.

I’ve used various apps and browser plugins over the years some of them more seamless than others.

Pocket is a good tool to save stories from the web for listening on a phone but I found there were also many instances when I wanted to listen directly from the browser on my computer.

There are a bunch of text-to-speech browser extensions but I’ve found the experiences somewhat disjointed. I like the “Read Aloud” browser extension for Chrome Edge and Firefox for example but you control and interact with it using an alternative version of the text that pops up from the toolbar not the native text on a web page.

Microsoft Edge’s “Read aloud” feature is controllable directly from a web page after activating it from a menu accessible under the three dots in the upper right of the browser frame or by right-clicking on the text.

As it reads you can click on the actual text on the page to go to a particular section.

As with most automated text-to-speech technologies sometimes you do have to put up with some minor annoyances such as the voice reading fine print menu items or disclaimers on a site. The ability to select the text to be read or jump around by clicking on the text helps to overcome that when listening via the browser.

Significant improvement in voice quality: But the grabber for me is the increasing authenticity of some of the Microsoft voices: the inflections the pauses the lack of the tell-tale robotic vocal fry. For example here is “Microsoft Michelle Online (Natural)” reading this paragraph.

It’s not perfect. The AI can still sound briefly robotic. Unusual names can also cause problems. Reading this story today about Geocaching by my colleague Kurt Schlosser for example “Michelle” pronounces it “Geo-coshing.”

Still the quality is much better than the drone voices that had my friends and colleagues making fun of my attempts to use text-to-speech tools in the past.

Microsoft Edge’s features for importing data and passwords standard in browsers these days made the switch relatively easy. Edge’s use of Chromium the underlying open-source engine that powers Chrome also helped ease the transition. Edge debuted in 2015 and the company officially retired Internet Explorer this year.

Mobile syncing benefits and bugs: The feature is also available in the Edge browser for smartphones and it works well there. You can access “read aloud” by clicking on the three dots at the bottom of the Edge mobile app.

But this also shows where Microsoft is falling short. Edge’s “Collections” feature for saving web pages is supposed to sync across PCs and mobile devices when logged in via Microsoft account. I’ve set up a “Read Later” collection where theoretically I can save articles in my PC browser for the AI to read aloud later in the Edge app on my Android phone.

The articles do save in my PC browser but my Edge Collections won’t sync to my phone. I’ve checked all the settings gone through all the troubleshooting steps without any luck. All of my other data is syncing. This appears to be a problem for many others as well.

I’ll keep trying to find a fix and I’ll update this story if I do. Even if it is a case of user error it shouldn’t be this hard.

Amazon Alexa and audiobooks: This is probably a subject for another post but I’m also a fan of Amazon Alexa’s feature for reading Kindle books on Echo devices but the implementation in my experience is less than ideal frequently forgetting where you were when you stopped having Alexa read to you.

It’s going to be fascinating to see the impact that the growing authenticity of synthetic voices has on Amazon’s Audible audiobook subsidiary in the years ahead.

In the meantime if anyone out there has any feedback ideas or different approaches for making the most of text-to-speech technology in your daily work please let me know via Twitter LinkedIn or my email address below."

Carpet maker Bremworth isn't wavering from its move to ditch synthetic alternatives for strong wool carpets even though it has come at a cost and a court case.

A legal stoush between Mohawk Industries-owned Godfrey Hirst - with revenues of $US11 billion last year - and Bremworth turned a corner about three weeks ago.

Godfrey Hirst abandoned its claim for damages at a High Court hearing.

It brought the case against Bremworth saying the company's claims around wool carpets being ""better for the environment"" and that a switch from synthetics to all wool carpets was ""changing for good"" were misleading.

Bremworth said this was despite Godfrey Hirst making similar claims including that it took pride in making the most environmentally friendly carpet on the planet.

Bremworth adopted a new strategy in which it shifted to only producing wool carpets in mid-2020.

Chief executive Greg Smith told 300 delegates at a red meat sector conference in Christchurch that it had looked at all the signs to see where consumers were heading and realised it could not compete in the cheap market.

""What did it all mean? It meant dropping around $60 million in revenue to reinvent the business to rebalance the business and grow again.

""That takes courage and that's the No 1 reason I joined Bremworth because there's a ton of businesses with words on the wall but not many places are prepared to take that type of decision and drop that type of income and grow again.""

The father of five children said Bremworth had reinvented itself as a premium design soft flooring and furnishing business with a focus on sustainability and like-minded consumers.

""Not everyone's happy with what we did. Not only did we make the big decision to drop the synthetics we actually made it very clear why we were doing that why we were going good.

""So we were very aggressive in extolling the virtues of strong wool and very aggressive in showing exactly what goes into synthetic carpet and our competitors really didn't like it.

""In fact on my first day at Bremworth they sued us.""

He said that had since changed with damages dropped against them.

""We are still going to court in September 2023 but somehow it's believed that mining subterranean carbon and the byproduct of that being plastic is more sustainable than sheep on hills on grass.

""So we look forward to that and won't shy away from that and that's the challenge we all have in front of us today to be bold to be courageous and make a line in the sand.""

Bremworth had gone from the darling of the sharemarket in the 1980s to the early-2000s with a share price at about $5 and dividends being paid 75 per cent of profits to at its worst 15c.

""That's a tough pill to swallow but the majority of shareholders have stuck with us and we hope to reward them over the coming years with the dividends they've been denied and with the value of the share price going up as a result of our success.""

About $10 million had been spent in marketing over the past two and a half years to talk about why strong wool was ""awesome"".

This was partly financed by the sale of plant land and buildings at Papatoetoe for about $24 million and through profits.

Smith said it would continue to invest more money over the next two years in New Zealand Australia and North America because perceptions of wool were changing to it being more sustainable and natural.

It would continue to make it clear that synthetics were man-made he said.

He said it was important to make profits because meaningful change would not be made otherwise.

It was committed to a $4.9 million sustainability programme and had just released a compostable rug that could be returned to the Earth.

Ultimately it could be upcycled into carpets rugs or other products such as insulation and underlay he said.

Another focus was on energy efficiency and carbon reduction.

Smith said better returns for farmers were important as wool supply was its No 1 threat with strong wool being stored in sheds because of low prices.

Before ""big oil"" came in with synthetic carpet wool was being picked off barbed wire fences at one stage because of its value.

He said wool carpet went on the backfoot when synthetic carpets were marketed as being cheaper and able to be recycled as it was plastic and then became softer with more lustre.

Bremworth entered the synthetic market but could not keep up with sole-business brands.

""But nothing lasts forever and fast forward a decade and consumers are waking up to the fact that plastic-based products are a problem and plastic doesn't go away or break down it only breaks up and as a result it pollutes our waterways our oceans and gets into our food chain.""

Smith said companies he had previously worked for - Icebreaker and Michael Hill Jeweller - were started by business founders prepared to challenge the norm when their industries faced enormous change and challenges.

He said the red meat sector should not be afraid of being bold while it faced challenges with the movement away from farming and real food towards plant-based products.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Samai is its foundation brand the name derived from Quichua Ecuador’s most widely spoken indigenous language which translates into ‘breath of the rainforest’.

The mission-driven producer works to deliver more than just tasty and nutritious snacks and partners with local farmers who hand-pick topical fruits and veg.

It also places sustainability front and centre and has established several initiatives focused on reforestation to reduce greenhouse gases such as the Armadillo Wildlife Corridor and Care Enough which helps health and education programmes in rural Ecuadorian communities.

In a recent study Samai even came out as a carbon negative snack.

We caught up with Wladimir Torres at Snackex to find out more about the chips.

Simply put: they’re good for you to snack on

“Our chips are 100% natural and plant-based. Our main line are plantain [vegetable banana] and we them fresh and season them. So it's a very simple good for you to snack”​ Torres told BakeryandSnacks.

The Santo Domingo-based company is looking to spread its wings further into Europe having already established partnerships with distributors in the UK Spain France and Switzerland.

“We’re looking to spread out business to the Netherlands Germany and Eastern Europe … so we’re kind of going from south to north northeast.”​

The rise of climate positive snacks

There is a marked trend towards snacks that are not only good for people but the planet too and ‘snack-ifying climate change’ is now de rigueur.​

Some of the biggest food players are in on the movement including Mondelez with NoCOé its first net zero carbon cracker; Impact Snacks’ superfood bars; Zeelandia and FrieslandCampina’s carbon-free cheesecake; and the AAB EverGrain and Post Holding’s Bright Future Foods JV with Airly crackers.

Samai is right there at the forefront of this emerging megatrend.

“The outcome of this study that we conducted a couple years ago about the carbon emissions that we actually produced through our processing process came out carbon negative” ​said Torres.

“We thought we were carbon neutral that for every kilo of Samai snacks that people enjoy we put away 11kg of CO2. So [the result of the study] was kind of a surprise to us … and we are very happy.”​

Giving back to people and the planet

A major initiative set up by the company is the Armadillo Wildlife Corridor born in 2018 to capture greenhouse gases through reforestation recuperate pristine water sources and protect the endemic flora and fauna of Santo Domingo de los Tsáchilas (Ecuador) – where Samai chips are produced.

The region is known for its rich culture and beautiful cloud forest but has unfortunately been subject to mass deforestation.

The wildlife corridor has its own learning centre where the local community is educated on preserving the environment.

“It is an initiative that we worked out with the local government to a connect patches of natural forest left in the province of Santo Domingo de los Tsáchilas Ecuador. We put together an area that was an isolated [patch] of rainforest so now the fauna and flora are actually connected”​ said Torres adding the biocorridor starts at the Samai processing plant and stretches for around 25-27km into the rainforest.

Exotic Blends also set up the Care Enough programme to support health and education programmes in rural Ecuadorian communities.

“One of our most important initiatives is supporting Hogar Valle Feliz (Happy Valley Orphanage) in Santo Domingo de los Tsáchilas Ecuador. Valle Feliz is a home and school for underprivileged youth currently housing 60 children.”​

Looking forward Torres said the Ecuadorian producer will maintain its mission to produce simple natural snacks while giving back to the community and the earth.

“Being able to keep that in our minds and in our business you know locally sourced snacks or raw materials make them available to the global market taking into account our responsibility to our people and planet.

Negotiations between the two companies – reported by Bloomberg – are said to be in an early stage with a price yet to be finalised. Sources close to the matter said the deal may be valued at more than US$3bn although another source said the price would be closer to $2bn.

Neither Keurig Dr Pepper nor VPX responded immediately to Just Drinks’ requests for comment.

Bang was created in 2012 and was initially introduced to the US market by VPX as a low-sugar carbonated energy drink. VPX has production facilities in Florida and Arizona.

In April 2020 the company entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with PepsiCo which saw the Pepsi Max owner become the exclusive distributor for Bang in the US. The deal quickly turned sour however with VPX filing a lawsuit in which it accused PepsiCo of intimidation tactics and of “gross misconduct” in the distribution of Bang.

An arbitration ruling meant VPX was forced to continue using PepsiCo as its distributor until October 2023 but the dispute was later resolved allowing VPX to leave the exclusive agreement in June of this year.

US energy drinks M&A boom

The US energy drinks category is buoyant registering sales of $22bn in 2021 according to GlobalData. The category’s healthy growth is set to continue reaching US$30bn by 2026. The five-year compound annual growth rate of the category is set to be 4.05%.

As a result global beverage giants are increasingly investing in smaller fast-growing brands in the category. Last year The Coca-Cola Co. completed the purchase of sports beverage brand Bodyarmor in a deal worth US$5.6bn. Last month PepsiCo which already owns the Rockstar Energy brand took an 8.5% stake in Celsius for US$550m.

Monster Energy which is itself part-owned by The Coca-Cola Co. has also been the subject of speculation linking it with a possible merger with Constellation Brands.

Alfred Garza III wakes up around 11 a.m. most days and downs a can of Monster Energy drink. After a shower he heads to a popular eatery here El Herradero de Jalisco and orders a fajita chicken salad. Then he makes his way to his father’s mechanic shop where he hangs out until evening.

Then he goes home to watch Netflix or YouTube videos until he falls asleep around 1 a.m.

That’s been the grieving father’s routine since May 24 when a gunman killed 10-year-old Amerie Jo Garza his only child along with 18 other students and two teachers at Robb Elementary. Since that day he’s been unable to muster the will to return to his old life and his job as a salesman at a local auto dealership.

Garza 35 worries he’ll fall behind on his mortgage and car payments. He’s scrounging to pay for gas and food. And he’s confused about why he’s been unable to find meaningful financial assistance from nonprofits or the state despite millions of dollars being made available to the people of Uvalde after the shooting.

“I’m not expecting life-changing money out of the situation” Garza said from his living room where the last school portrait of his daughter hangs on the wall. “It’s just to get me through this rough patch until I go back to work.”

After the shooting Gov. Greg Abbott announced he would allocate $5 million for Uvalde to open a social services center for grieving residents. That created confusion for many in the community including the mayor and a state senator for the area who said they expected those dollars to flow directly to residents.

“It’s just ridiculous it’s almost like where’s this money going? Like ‘Hey I need help I need money’” Garza said.

Separately at least $16 million has been raised from thousands of donations from across the country flowing into GoFundMe accounts and local nonprofit organizations. But that money hasn’t yet been distributed to the people it’s intended for and it could take months before that is sorted out — the local committee overseeing the largest donation fund wants to wait two more months before the money is distributed.

Garza’s not the only one struggling to get by. One in five Uvalde residents — who are mostly Mexican American — live below the federal poverty line. And the trauma of Texas’ most deadly school shooting touches the victims’ families and friends the survivors and the students teachers and staff at Robb Elementary.

Several funds each with their own rules

Mickey Gerdes a local attorney who chairs the 10-member committee in charge of the Uvalde Together We Rise fund said donations have reached $16 million so far collected through a GoFundMe account for the victims’ families survivors of the shooting and other local and regional organizations that have been fundraising.

Since it was formed on June 22 the committee has held two town hall meetings the latest one last week to allow families to share how they feel the money should be divided and who should qualify. The committee also needed time to research laws and make sure that recipients don’t get taxed for relief money and that they don’t lose other benefits such as Medicare and Medicaid after receiving financial help Gerdes said.

He said he understands families need the money now so the committee has agreed to start giving advances from $10000 up to $25000 after the application process opens on Sept. 8. Those advances will be deducted from the overall amount each recipient receives he added.

Gerdes said the committee chose an Oct. 20 cutoff date for donations “to maximize the number of funds” and will start accepting applications for the money on Sept. 8 through the National Compassion Fund. The committee has partnered with the nonprofit which has helped distribute $105 million since 2014 to victims and victims’ families of mass shootings.

In the meantime families who lost loved ones or were injured in the shooting can apply for emergency funds to help pay for rent mortgages groceries or gas at hopeforuvalde.org. That fund is designed to help in the short term before the National Compassion Fund begins to distribute the larger funds.

Garza and others have turned to other places for financial help which can be a time-consuming process. Garza said he filled out a nine-page application for help from the state attorney general’s Crime Victims’ Compensation Program a 43-year-old program open to anyone in Texas who has been the victim of a crime. Two weeks later Garza said he received $1000 just enough to make one mortgage payment.

After the Uvalde shooting the attorney general’s office promoted the program in a news release saying the “team is working around the clock to ensure all qualifying applications are expeditiously reviewed approved if allowed under Texas law and reimbursed.”

The agency’s website says awards are capped at $50000 and are meant to cover the costs of lost wages medical expenses or funeral costs. According to the office $36213 had been paid “to or on behalf of victims” of the Uvalde shooting as of Monday.

The attorney general’s office “has not denied any claims related to the Uvalde shooting to date” said Josh Reno deputy attorney general of criminal justice. “It’s also worth noting that Texans have been extraordinarily generous in supporting the Uvalde community and victims of the horrific murders. The demand on the [Crime Victims’ Compensation] Program may therefore be less than it would be otherwise.”

“My heart breaks for the families and community in Uvalde. Words can hardly do justice — let alone money” said Attorney General Ken Paxton in a statement in May. “I encourage all victims their families and providers to apply for this program to help ease the burden they’re carrying.”

Garza also said he received some cash and gas station and grocery store gift cards which helped him pay for his June and July expenses. He said he wasn’t clear on who gave this money out but the Community Council of South Central Texas and the state Department of Housing and Community Affairs have provided more than $400000 in gas cards hotel stays mortgage assistance and utility assistance to at least 192 Uvalde households.

“Our heads are not in the right place to be even doing any of that [paperwork] stuff” Garza said. “It’s just very inconvenient to have to go through that to get help.”

Confusion about state money causes friction

In May Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin and state Sen. Roland Gutierrez whose district covers Uvalde wrote a letter to Abbott that said the family of a shooting victim was at risk of having their power cut off while their daughter was in the hospital while other families were offered compensation of two weeks’ pay which they called “meager.”

The letter didn’t say who or what agency offered the two-week pay for some families.

In the letter McLaughlin and Gutierrez asked Abbott to remove Uvalde District Attorney Christina Mitchell Busbee from overseeing the $5 million grant the state provided to Uvalde.

“These families cannot begin to heal unless they are given time to grieve free from financial worry” Gutierrez said in the letter. “In short the State of Texas ought to use every available resource in law to make these families whole.”

Abbott’s office responded by saying the governor would support whoever local officials put in charge of the social services center funded by the $5 million grant.

Busbee said the $5 million was never meant to be given directly to families. Instead the grant required Uvalde to create the Uvalde Together Resiliency Center where Uvalde residents can receive free services including counseling help applying for unemployment benefits and services from the Mexican consulate by request.

Busbee said that she worries that McLaughlin and Gutierrez’s letter caused misinformation to spread.

“The [$5 million] grant actually prohibits me from taking money and giving it specifically to individuals” she said. “That’s not what it’s for. It’s to run the resiliency center on behalf of the Uvalde community.”

The mayor didn’t respond to an interview request regarding the $5 million grant.

Gutierrez said in a phone interview the intention of his letter was to bring attention to the families who are struggling to get by. He said if families can’t receive money from the $5 million grant he wants the Texas Division of Emergency Management to assign case workers to help families fill out the paperwork for other programs and help them navigate any other bureaucracy.

“The biggest thing that families are needing more than anything is essentially resources to pay the bills” he said. “There are people that they’re simply traumatized and can’t go to work.”

He said some families have received donations directly through their own GoFundMe accounts “but not everybody had the same successful GoFundMe page.” He said the governor should be doing more to help families because Abbott has “failed to understand the problem on the ground.”

Renae Eze a spokesperson for Abbott said in a statement that the governor “has taken immediate action to address all aspects of the heinous crime committed in Uvalde working with state agencies to deploy all available resources and provide support to the victims’ families and the Uvalde community.”

Eze said that apart from the $5 million grant for the center Abbott has provided $1.25 million to the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District for counseling another $105.5 million for school safety upgrades and mental health services across Texas and issued a disaster declaration in Uvalde so that agencies such as the Texas Division of Emergency Management could set up the temporary facility to house the resiliency center.

“I’m trying to put it back together”

The new resiliency center is now in a temporary location just outside of the city limits behind the Uvalde County Fairplex an event venue and indoor arena. The center is made up of a tent and 10 air-conditioned pods where counselors conduct sessions with residents.

Mary Beth Fisk the interim executive director of the Uvalde Together Resiliency Center said that since the center opened in June it has received 3000 visits from local residents mostly for counseling services.

Fisk said that while not everybody may be ready to see a counselor she wants the community to know that there are services available. They have done different outreach campaigns buying ads in the local paper telling religious leaders to tell their congregations about the center and spreading the word on social media.

“The commitment is for the long term. We’re here to serve so families get what they deserve” Fisk said.

The goal Busbee said is to keep the center open for at least four years using the state money. Uvalde County commissioners recently approved the purchase of a building where the center will be located for the long term using $700000 in state funds separate from the $5 million grant. The building which used to house a bank will be renovated using a separate grant or Uvalde County general funds Busbee said.

Garza who says he’s gone to one counseling session said he hasn’t gone back to work because he doesn’t think he can focus on work. All he thinks about is Amerie Jo and “what my life was like when I had my daughter what my life is like now without my daughter and what my life is gonna be going forward.”

He misses his daughter’s infectious laugh. Amerie Jo he said was a witty girl who like him loved to socialize with people. He said he thinks he needs at least another two months before he feels “ready to go back out into the world.”

But whether he can afford to be out of work for two months is something he also considers. He said he is hoping he could get an advance from the National Compassion Fund once that becomes available.

“That’s kind of what I’m trying to process right now” said Garza who wore a cap with his daughter’s initials embroidered in red letters. “My life is kind of like in pieces right now and I’m trying to put it back together.”

Lucadano alleged that the federal judge who signed off on the settlement agreed to a deal in which not all class action members suffered a sufficient injury and the Ninth Circuit Court agreed with him. He was with Morgan Stanley from 2009-2014 and is now with LPL.

Chen was with Morgan Stanley as a broker/rep from 1999 until 2013 when he was terminated by the wirehouse for allegedly requesting and receiving reimbursement from the company for expenses described as client gifts when the orders for the gifts were canceled by the rep according to FINRA.

Chen joined Oppenheimer & Co. but was allowed to resign after being barred from the industry by FINRA for allegedly converting firm funds falsifying firm records and causing Morgan Stanley’s books and records to be inaccurate according to FINRA.

Big Tech critics are wary of the power they hold in the digital worlds

US tech giant Alphabet is the largest among publicly-traded companies that invested in the space between September 2021 and June 2022.

Crypto intelligence platform Blockdata used the size of funding rounds as a proxy for investor involvement. The Google parent invested in funding rounds that totaled $1.5 billion across four blockchain companies — Fireblocks Dapper Labs Voltage and Digital Currency Group — in the last 10 months Blockdata’s study found.

“In most cases we cannot determine how much money these corporations have invested as they participate in funding rounds with multiple or many other investors” the platform noted.

Alphabet which held cash reserves of nearly $125 billion by the end of June is one of the most prolific investors in the startup ecosystem through its investing vehicles. Crunchbase data shows Google Ventures has made 990 investments CapitalG counts 106 and Gradient Ventures has 158.

Other top companies participating in the funding of blockchain companies over the same time frame are BlackRock and Morgan Stanley according to the study. Top Wall Street banks Goldman Sachs BNY Mellon Citi and Wells Fargo also feature on the list.

Overall 40 companies invested about $6 billion in blockchain-related investments in that time period. Investments covered in the study would’ve partly been carried out during the cryptocurrency market downturn triggered by TerraUSD’s crash in May.

Alphabet boss Sundar Pichai confirmed earlier this year that the company was exploring how to integrate blockchain technology into its services like YouTube and Google Maps.

“Anytime there’s innovation I find it exciting and I think it is something we want to support the best we can” Pichai said during an earnings call.

“The web has always evolved and it’s going to continue to evolve and as Google we have benefited tremendously from open-source technologies so we do plan to contribute there” he said.

Worries over Big Tech influence

Critics of Big Tech firms have previously lashed out over them wielding too much power. Web3 companies built on the premise that future companies will live on the blockchain operate with the same idea that supports cryptocurrencies. They won’t be controlled by single entities like Facebook or Google.

Yat Sui board chairman at Animoca Brands recently described the empires of Meta and Microsoft as “digital dictatorships” in a Bloomberg interview. Animoca which itself is a big blockchain investor says its goal is to give people ownership of their digital property and dissolve the influence of Big Tech.

Correction Aug. 19 2022 at 9:09 am ET: The size of the individual investments from Alphabet-affiliated companies and others studied is not known. Blockdata used the total amounts companies fundraised as an approximation of the relative size of investments.

""From Brussels to Tokyo to Washington governments are determined to lower their dependence on Beijing"" it underlined.

Explaining it by an example it said It was a difficult balancing act for New Delhi when it decided to abstain from the 15-nation UN security council vote to condemn Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The stance was clear that Delhi didn’t want to alienate Russia an important historical friend which supplies 46% of its military equipment without also antagonizing the U.S. its largest trading partner.

The global brokerage feels India's geographical stance makes economic condition of the country favuorable for a decade.

However it feels the India is yet to realise the kind of industrial transformation that turned countries like China and South Korea into miracle economies by building their manufacturing capabilities.

But this is changing with the government's efforts to actively incentivize large scale manufacturing capacities through production linked incentive (PLI) schemes. ""India’s economic growth was led by services unlike the Asian tigers. PLI schemes have attracted interest across 14 sectors including automobiles solar panels and advanced batteries. Buoyed by the government’s PLI scheme India now is an exporter of mobile phones"" it underlined.

India Vs China

Delhi is also focusing on import substitution in manufacturing to enhance domestic capacity and reduce external dependence. ""As firms everywhere reconfigure supply chains to lessen their reliance on China India has an opportunity to increase its manufacturing helped by a $26 billion subsidy scheme.

As per Morgan Stanely while India has been reducing dependence on China and working on generating employment China struggles with working-age population which has been decreasing .

""Emerging sectors such as aerospace semiconductors and renewables should help increase youth employment. The reform measures are starting to pay off. The “Make in India” initiative encourages both foreign and domestic investment in the manufacturing sector; “Smart Cities” aims to eradicate urban squalor and “Digital India” targets an overhaul of government services with electronic identity digital payments and bank accounts"" it said.

On the contrast China’s economy is slowing down faced with a shrinking workforce industrial overcapacity a floundering property market a mountain of debt and renewed COVID lockdowns.

Speaking on status of the real estate in the two countries it said while investment to GDP ratio in India hovers at 30% China’s has peaked at 45% and a big share of that is real estate investment. The real estate sector accounts for around 29% of GDP in China more than double the ratio in India according to IMF economist Yuanchen Yang.

The working-age population in China is now shrinking which will further erode the demand for housing over the coming years hurting future growth it said.

""The reverse holds in India. After being in doldrums for the past 3 years India’s real estate sector is set to recover. As more of India’s population heads to the cities demand for housing increases"" said the brokerage."

Hello I'm Oscar. In this trailer I introduce the new features of Season 02 of the Mosaic of China podcast. This includes the PREMIUM version of the show with 10-15 minutes of extra content for every episode.

Transcript

OF: Hello this is Oscar Fuchs. And welcome to Season 2 of the Mosaic of China podcast. Just like Season 1 over the next 30 episodes we will be hearing from a diverse group of 30 people who are making their mark in China. I don't want to ruin any surprises so let me just say that there are some great stories from both Chinese and non-Chinese guests on their way over the coming weeks.

If you're a new listener welcome and here's a quick recap of how the show works. There are three parts to each interview. The first part is a straightforward two-way conversation which starts with the guest introducing an object that in some way describes their life in China. In the second part I ask every guest the same 10 China-related questions all on the theme of their personal experiences tastes and opinions. And the final part is just one extra question where I ask each guest to nominate someone for the next Season of Mosaic of China. And this is how the tiles of this Mosaic will connect and continue to build out in future seasons.

There are also a few things that are new in Season 2 one of them being that this is the first time that we can link new guests back to the people who nominated them from the previous season of the show. So you'll hear how that works in the first episode coming next week. Secondly there will be transcripts available now on https://mosaicofchina.com/transcripts. These have been designed for anyone whose first language isn't English or of course for listeners with hearing impairments or for any English speakers who want to follow the words spoken in Chinese. Thirdly if you'd like to join the community and track all the images alongside each episode on WeChat I've finally been able to rename the WeChat account to ID: mosaicofchina all one word so please add me there from now on and I'll add you to the group. That's consistent now with the accounts that already exist at @mosaicofchina_* on Instagram and @mosaicofchina on Facebook if you would still prefer to follow there.

And finally the biggest difference for Season 2 is that there will now be TWO versions of the show. The normal version will be exactly the same as last season. But I'm also releasing an extended version of the show where there will be an average of 10-20 minutes of extra content for every episode. These will accumulate to up to 10 hours of extra content over the course of the entire season and they can be accessed for the tiny cost of US$2 per month at https://patreon.com/mosaicofchina.com all one word. This is the way I came up with to keep the show free from advertising to still allow you to listen to the series for free while at the same time create a a way to accept donations towards the cost of putting this all together. So if you have anything to spare and you want to help fund this independent project as an early Christmas present please head over to patreon.com/mosaicofchina and you can look forward to getting some great extra content too.

Thanks to all of you for your continued support and I hope to see you back here next week for Episode 1 of the Season.

There could be numerous reasons behind this behavior and this can be resolved without any technical know-how. We have listed some methods that are easy to follow and will not take much time to follow and replicate.

Without any further ado let’s just quickly jump onto the four quick ways you can follow right away to fix your Android WiFi limited connectivity issue:

#1. Restart Your Android Device

Restarting the device has proved from time to time that it can fix a lot of known issues as well as the issues related to cache data temporarily stored in the device because it clears most of the temporary cache data.

The method is one of the simplest and takes about two minutes to complete. Here’s how:

Press and hold the power button until a menu pops up on the screen. On the menu you should be able to see the restart option. Tap it. Now wait for the device to reboot.

If in case you are unable to find the restart or reboot option then simply power off and then power on your Android device a process that is also known as power cycling and gives a similar effect.

#2. Restart your Internet Router

Restarting your internet router is highly recommended as there have been issues where the router malfunctions and is unable to transmit specific signals but restarting it fixes this issue and the router establishes a new connection from the beginning.

Once the internet connectivity becomes stable you can then try to browse the internet on your Android device and see if the network is working fine or not.

#3. Double Check Date and Time Settings

Making sure that your device has properly configured date and time settings is important. Not only that but the time zone should be correct too. If any of those settings are incorrect then your Android device will not be able to initiate a connection to the internet.

Here’s what you need to do to verify the date and time settings on your Android:

Go to Settings. Look for General Management or System option. Tap on Date and time. Now you need to double-check if the time zone date and time are properly configured according to your local timings.

Once verified you can now retry using the internet and see if it’s working.

#4. Forget WiFi Network and Reconnect

The Android operating system automatically stores the details of the WiFi network whenever your device successfully connects to the one for the first time allowing your device to automatically reconnect to the network without asking for permission or password over and over again.

To forget this network we have a simple fix for this here’s what you need to do:

Go to Settings. Tap on Connections and then select WiFi. On the top right corner you should see Advanced tap it. In the list you will find Manage networks. Tap it. Here you will be able to see a list of all the saved WiFi networks with their SSID name. Tap on the one that you are having issues with and then select Forget. This will remove the network from your device. You can now go back to the main WiFi settings menu select your wireless network and enter the password to connect to the network.

Use the internet and see whether the issue is resolved.

For more than a decade Horizons ETFs has managed one of the largest covered call suites in Canada. Effective on June 27 2022 they’ve added another to their covered call suite: the Horizons Nasdaq-100 Covered Call ETF (QQCC) which trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). For the first time investors now have a Canadian-listed opportunity to gain exposure to the Nasdaq-100 Index® (NDX®) while enhancing distribution yield and income through an actively managed options strategy.



Like the Global X Nasdaq-100 Covered Call ETF (QYLD) listed on Nasdaq in the U.S. QQCC will have exposure to 100 of the largest domestic and international non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market. QQCC seeks to provide to the extent possible and net of expenses: (a) exposure to the performance of an index of the largest domestic and international non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock market (currently NDX); and (b) monthly U.S. dollar distributions of dividend and call option income. To mitigate downside risk and generate income QQCC will employ a dynamic covered call option writing program. QQCC will not seek to hedge its exposure to the U.S. dollar back to the Canadian dollar.

While not explicitly a downside protection strategy QQCC could function as a conservative income-generation vehicle for Canadian investors where more stable cash flows compensate for the diminished upside that investors receive from any price appreciation in NDX®. The upside is capped directly because of the call options that the fund sells in the market.

Prior to the launch of this product Canadian investors who wanted to implement a covered call strategy on the NDX® had to build and structure their own portfolios or invest in U.S.-listed ETFs. Most investors and financial advisors do not have the time or expertise to run a covered call fund but now they can let experts execute the strategy on their behalf through an ETF.

QQCC is co-managed by Hans Albrecht and Nick Piquard – both are Vice Presidents Portfolio Managers and Options Strategists at Horizons ETFs. Albrecht who has been overseeing Horizons ETFs’ day-to-day options activities for nine years was previously a floor options market maker and traded a large volatility book for National Bank Financial. Piquard spent nearly 15 years as an institutional derivatives trader with Canadian and international brokerage firms. He specializes in quantitative strategies trading options volatility and relative value. The two portfolio managers have over 50 years of collective experience in trading options and derivatives.

According to Albrecht QQCC’s approach is slightly different from QYLD. QYLD is a passive strategy that executes its mandate on the same day each month. The portfolio managers sell options or potentially cover in-the-money options regardless of the environment. QQCC on the other hand is a strategy that adjusts to the prevailing regime and the portfolio managers decide when to sell options. As such the approach is more opportunistic.

“We look at things from a volatility and options pricing perspective and we apply that active outlook to the strategy” Albrecht explains. “QYLD sells 100% coverage so options are fully written against the underlying holdings whereas we can be 25% written 50% written and even higher. We can adjust that as we see opportunities arise.”



Generally QQCC will write shorter-dated out-of-the-money covered calls. Shorter-dated options with an expiry of less than two months tend to provide a balance between earning an attractive level of premium while increasing the likelihood that the options will expire without being in the money. This strategy is designed to preserve a portion of the upside price potential of the underlying securities.



Historically the Nasdaq-100 Index® has not offered a very high dividend yield relative to other U.S. equity benchmarks. This is because many high-growth companies especially in the Technology sector do not pay dividends; those that do tend to have a low dividend yield. A covered call strategy is a way to potentially increase that income stream substantially through the use of covered calls that can help generate an income premium.



Typically when the constituents in an underlying index are under pressure and volatility rises options pricing improves and provides additional income and yield for the fund’s investors. Conversely when underlying index constituents are performing well and volatility is low the income from writing options is expected to be lower.



Recently volatility has been high and risk assets have corrected driven by inflation rising interest rates and geopolitical concerns. This environment has hit the Technology sector particularly hard. But Albrecht points out that Nasdaq-focused covered call strategies have continued to bring in assets during 2022 despite the real reset in the NDX®. Overall he is positive about the longterm prospects of the high-growth companies in the NDX® because their products are shaping the future of our society.



“What better time to launch a fund than when everything has pulled back and we see valuations at a much more compelling level compared to a few months ago” he concludes. “Fundamentally we still have these incredible narratives with staying power these stories that have 10 20 30 years of runway left to them as our world becomes more and more digital.”

Unfortunately Pure in their most recent ESG report appears to have published unsubstantiated and unrepresentative comparisons with an unnamed competitor. On the face of it these comparisons are so unlikely that it’s hard to assume that the company is acting in good faith. This ESG report infuriates me because as I type this large swathes of northern Europe are aflame. Summer temperatures are breaking records and scenes that I came to accept growing up in some of the more fire-prone regions of Australia seem bizarre and almost surreal when seen as part of the English countryside. Many people believe that these conditions are just a part of a natural cycle of weather events. However that belief is not reflected in significant sections of the investment community. As a result ESG investing has become in the words of The Economist one of “the hottest trends in finance.” In fact “the titans of investment management claim that more than one third of their assets or $35trn in total are monitored through one ESG lens or another.”

ESG is at the heart of our core values

Unfortunately there is a fair amount of debate about the validity and comparability of ESG efforts. With such large amounts of money involved some less ethical companies try to game the system or to misuse the metrics. This practice undermines the trust that ESG reporting is meant to create the very trust we are trying to build to make the world a better place. I know that sounds corny or like the tagline to a TV program but it's true. At least for the people I work with at NetApp; we want to leave this place better than we found it and the ESG report is one of the tools we use to do that. NetApp has a long history of measuring our efforts to improve in all three of the ESG areas. One of the goals of NetApp’s founders was to “build a model company” and it is often said that you cannot manage what you cannot measure. As a result a high level of intentional accountability is built into the NetApp culture. NetApp isn’t perfect but I’m proud of the work we do in continuing to build that model company after 30 years and to hold that work up against the work of our peers. Although it’s tempting to use ESG reports to compare companies there are good reasons why it should be done with great caution. Each company is unique each faces different challenges different supply chain environments different risks and different ways of collecting data all of which make direct comparisons almost impossible with any validity.

Too good to be true

Which brings me back to Pure and their most recent ESG report. Specifically Pure claims that an //X70 storage system consumes 61917 megajoules of power per year while their unnamed competitor’s array consumes 405360 megajoules. Both of these figures include roughly 30% overhead for cooling which would equate to a competitive all-flash array that requires around 9KW of power. As an indication of how unlikely it is for that to be a fair or representative comparison a NetApp® AFF A800 all-flash storage system delivers significantly better performance and scalability than an //X70 but consumes an average of only 1.4KW of power when filled to its maximum internal capacity. Even though Pure’s comparisons are suspect they take these figures and dumb them down to “84% Lower CO2 Emissions—Pure is responsible” at the top of their main webpage. That 84% figure appears to be entirely unrepresentative of the industry at large and therefore these claims undermine everything that a responsible ESG disclosure should be about.

Understanding lifecycle emissions

I’m not saying that Pure doesn’t try their best to reduce their environmental impact. Good people work there some of whom I consider to be my friends. But calculating lifecycle emissions is difficult and the way it’s done is unique to each company due to a wide range of factors including differences in supply chains business practice and more. ESG reports like the NetApp report aim to help us identify what we can do better and to track our progress against these important sustainability objectives. For example Dell understands this in their outline of what can and cannot be inferred from their life cycle analysis (LCA) and product carbon footprint (PCF). What is streamlined LCA intended for? In general LCA and PCF can be used to: provide a reasonable estimate of the range of carbon impact of a product. identify the major drivers of impact or carbon intensive hotspots in the lifecycle of the product thus identifying where reduction strategies should be focused. estimate changes in the environmental impact of a process or product over time. spark conversations related to sustainability with suppliers or to innovate new processes/materials uses

What streamlined LCA cannot be used for? In general LCA and PCF cannot be used to: compare results of ICT products head to head (i.e. laptop A against laptop B) in terms of carbon impact. compare products between other manufacturers. aggregate individual LCA/PCF studies to derive a figure for the total carbon impact of ICT and use this figure as a benchmark for reduction targets.

This summer I’ve raided my local bookstore on many occasions to find a new story to fall into while sitting on the beach the train or the porch of my childhood home. My enthusiasm for cheesy tales of love has even manifested in binging romances on streaming services — everything from “The Summer I Turned Pretty” to “Purple Hearts” to“Bridgerton” dominates my list of recently-viewed shows and films.

With “Bridgerton” in my back pocket I approached Netflix’s adaptation of Jane Austen’s beloved “Persuasion” a similar period piece and romantic drama with open and excited arms. I’ve been a fan of Dakota Johnson who portrays Austen’s main character Anne Elliot ever since she came clean about lying in her Architectural Digest house tour in which she proclaimed her undying love for limes. Johnson is sharp witty and mysterious. She brings these traits to all of the characters she portrays.

The emotional lead character of Austen’s novel makes a strong case for hiring an actress such as Johnson —whose talents would seemingly do the role justice. Elliot is a strong-willed young woman from high society in love with a sailor Frederik Wentworth of no rank or class. She is persuaded out of her love by both her family and society. The film adaptation offers a brief explanation of this past romance before jumping eight years into the future where fate will have it that Elliot and her sailor now a well-respected and wealthy captain cross paths again. Their families become intertwined as Wentworth’s sister and her husband unknowingly move into the longtime home of the Elliots who have been forced to downsize due to financial distress. A story of untold feelings broken betrothals and true love unfolds.

The trailer for “Persuasion” clues into the lightheartedness of the film portraying it as a tongue-in-cheek modern adaptation of Austen’s work. On the surface it sounds like the perfect addition to my summer spent searching for playful romances. But as the film began my excitement quickly turned sour.

Scenes that made my heart flutter as Elliot spoke of her love for Wentworth ended unceremoniously with a deadpan look to the camera — not unlike an episode of “The Office.” And with the inclusion of modern colloquialisms like “he’s a 10; I never trust a 10” combined with the “playful instrumental music” — as described by the closed captions — that followed each pitiful attempt at humor I found my skin crawling so much that I almost left the room. Austen’s dramatically romantic style was tarnished by these unceremonious attempts at humor dulling the plot and running the grandeur of the genre.

Through their overuse of on-trend anachronisms director Carrie Cracknell and writers Ron Bass and Alice Victoria Winslow show us that they did not trust a younger audience to relate to the central themes of Austen’s novel without overbearingly trying to connect to my generation’s tastes. But these themes — from heartbreak and second chances to family pressures and social inequality — continue to persist universally no matter the generation. As a viewer I’m truly saddened by the idea that the creative team behind such a film would think so little of their audience.

While taken aback by the dry attempts at humor the film continuously pushes I tried to follow the remnants of romance woven throughout the story as Wentworth played by Cosmo Jarvis and Elliot grapple with their feelings for each other even as new loves enter into their lives. However the character arcs in the film only confused me. Wentworth painted by Elliot as an intense intellectual and escape from her traditional life does not live up to this description. Instead on screen Jarvis is barely present and lacking in the charisma expected in a love interest. I almost find myself agreeing with Elliot’s family’s decision to persuade her out of marriage to him.

As the film progresses Louisa Musgrove Elliot’s young lovable and intelligent sister-in-law played by Nia Towle becomes very suddenly enamored by Wentworth. She pursues him after Elliot shuts down Musgrove’s heartfelt questioning of her feelings for the captain. Both Towle and Henry Golding playing Anne’s cousin William Elliot are welcome respites who bring much needed energy back into the washed out storyline. And it is only when William heir to Anne’s father’s fortune takes an interest in Anne that we see emotion flow back into our main characters. Golding plays William with the intellectual spark that Jarvis’s Wentworth is so heavily lacking. William and Anne’s periods on screen together filled with romantic banter are the only times within the film that true chemistry was achieved. I craved more screen time for the duo. William’s presence also gives Wentworth a momentary flicker of liveliness as he becomes jealous of his involvement with Anne but this is short-lived.

The tortured emotions that envelop Austen’s novel are cast aside for the sake of a laugh in the film. The storyline is stretched thin and I never find myself completely persuaded — for lack of a better word — by any character even with such a star-studded cast. Many of them seem just as rattled by the story’s progression as I do in their portrayals. The only exception was Mia McKenna-Bruce. The film may be worth watching if not only for her vain and egotistic portrayal of Mary Anne’s younger sister. She is self-aware in a way completely different from Anne — and she does so without having to repeatedly break the fourth wall.

As a Netflix film the settings of each scene range beautifully from dramatic to playful and they are as intricately detailed as the costume design itself. But it seems that not even a big budget could save this production from its poor execution. Johnson’s witty personality shines through as Anne Elliot but she is dampened by the objectively dull and unpleasant film she finds herself in.

Rating: ★★☆☆☆",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vbWFzaGFibGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvbmV0ZmxpeC1hZHMta2lkcy1zaG93cy1tb3ZpZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Netflix won't play ads on children's shows or movies,"Netflix’s new ad-supported plan won’t put ads on everything on the service.

The popular streaming service has informed its partners that children’s programming and original movies will be immune to advertising on its new cheaper ad-supported plan according to a report from Bloomberg . The plan is set to launch near the start of 2023 and will cost less than the current “standard” plan  which runs customers $15.49/mo for HD streaming. It’s possible it could replace the $10/mo standard-definition plan that’s already in place but Netflix has yet to confirm pricing for the new ad-supported tier.

The price isn’t the only part of this report that’s still up in the air. Netflix’s “no ads on kid’s content or original movies” edict could have some carve-outs. For one Bloomberg says only “some” third parties that license children’s programming have asked Netflix not to run ads on their shows so it’s possible that others will have ads on them after all. In addition original movies could get ads eventually; Bloomberg’s report said they could only be ad-free “at first.”

One thing that’s more certain about the new ad-supported plan is that anyone who pays for it will lose one feature that comes with more expensive versions of Netflix. Namely they won’t be able to download shows or movies for offline viewing. If you want to watch Stranger Things on an airplane you better pay for slow airline WiFi or shell out for a higher tier of Netflix.

Still that said Netflix turning off ads on children’s shows is probably for the best. Kids don’t need to have things sold to them. They’ll have their entire adulthoods for that.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9maWxtLzIwMjIvYXVnLzE5L2ktY2FtZS1ieS1yZXZpZXctaHVnaC1ib25uZXZpbGxlLWdldHMtbmFzdHktaW4tc2lsbHktbmV0ZmxpeC10aHJpbGxlctIBcmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9maWxtLzIwMjIvYXVnLzE5L2ktY2FtZS1ieS1yZXZpZXctaHVnaC1ib25uZXZpbGxlLWdldHMtbmFzdHktaW4tc2lsbHktbmV0ZmxpeC10aHJpbGxlcg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I Came By review – Hugh Bonneville gets nasty in silly Netflix thriller,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.theguardian.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /film/2022/aug/19/i-came-by-review-hugh-bonneville-gets-nasty-in-silly-netflix-thriller (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159B981BD30>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9maWxtLzIwMjIvYXVnLzE5L2ktY2FtZS1ieS1yZXZpZXctaHVnaC1ib25uZXZpbGxlLWdldHMtbmFzdHktaW4tc2lsbHktbmV0ZmxpeC10aHJpbGxlctIBcmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9maWxtLzIwMjIvYXVnLzE5L2ktY2FtZS1ieS1yZXZpZXctaHVnaC1ib25uZXZpbGxlLWdldHMtbmFzdHktaW4tc2lsbHktbmV0ZmxpeC10aHJpbGxlcg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Celebrating 50000 vaccine doses given at the SuperVax vaccine clinic on Amazon’s Seattle campus

Amazon and Virginia Mason Franciscan Health are celebrating a milestone in COVID-19 vaccinations. On April 24 the 50000th vaccine dose was administered at the SuperVax vaccine clinic at the Amazon Meeting Center in Seattle.

In addition to the clinic in Seattle Amazon has collaborated with Arlington County Health and JBG Smith on a clinic at its HQ2 location in Arlington Virginia. Since March 29 more than 14000 doses have been administered at this location.

Amazon has also been providing surge support to the Washington State Department of Health’s 2-1-1 call center amid a spike in COVID-19 questions. The center was overloaded with wait times of up to an hour and a backlog of 4500 voicemails until a new system using Amazon volunteers and Amazon Connect technology was launched in March. The center has since processed over 100000 calls. The center also eliminated wait times by immediately connecting callers to a response system that uses the same natural language-understanding technology that powers Alexa.

Amazon updates return to office guidance

Today we shared this update with our teams globally:

Many of you have been asking for some guidance around returning to the office so you can better plan the next several months (including school plans for those with kids). We wanted to share our thinking and provide an update beyond the June 30 guidance we’ve provided to date.

Our plan is to return to an office-centric culture as our baseline. We believe it enables us to invent collaborate and learn together most effectively.

The timelines for returning to the office will vary by country depending on the infection and vaccination rates and we expect our return to the office to be gradual. In many parts of Asia our employees are already back in the office. In the U.S. as vaccines become broadly available in the next few months we expect more people will start coming into the office through the summer with most back in the office by early fall. In some countries in Europe we expect in-person working to take longer given recent setbacks. As we get closer to the summer we’ll develop more country-specific plans and post all updates to Inside Amazon under Local News.

As a reminder Amazon offices remain open and about 10% of our corporate population currently works from an office each day.

But the paper may have buried the lede running five paragraphs off page one and splashing instead with a story about the teacher brain drain while highlighting another about John Howard. Perhaps the broadsheet’s underplaying of the story is why the nation’s media largely ignored the bombshell for 48 hours.

The Australian had the first exclusive extract from Plagued a new book by its political editor Simon Benson and chief political correspondent Geoff Chambers in the Inquirer section. The accompanying news story ran on page two.

Benson and Chambers who had access to the PM and his inner circle for two years as the Coalition government managed Covid-19 revealed that Morrison “hatched a radical and until now secret plan in March 2020 with then-attorney general Christian Porter to swear himself in as health and finance minister alongside Greg Hunt and Mathias Cormann”.

View image in fullscreen John Howard on the front page of the Weekend Australian above the Scott Morrison story.

Like Morrison who was later to confirm he freely volunteered the information the authors appeared to underestimate the fury this – and later revelations of additional secrecy and a total of five portfolios – would unleash.

The two journalists framed the story of Morrison’s extraordinary move not as an affront to democracy and the Westminster system of government but as “an elegant solution to the problem they were trying to solve”.

Benson a friend of Morrison and a journalist known for getting “drops” from the former government was granted access to the prime minister during the pandemic to chronicle his leadership through the Covid-19 crisis.

Morrison confirmed at his marathon press conference on Wednesday that the book “was written based on interviews that were conducted at the time in the middle of the tempest”.

While Plagued revealed that Hunt was aware of the appointment of the PM to his portfolio there was no mention of whether Cormann was in on the secret.

There was also no hint of the problematic nature of Morrison’s secret appointments or a prosecution of why he didn’t tell the public. As the Australian’s editor-at-large Paul Kelly wrote two days later in the same newspaper: “The dilemma for Morrison is the secrecy. Secrecy is the curse in this fiasco.”

After Saturday the Australian moved on from the story and it was not mentioned in Monday’s paper at all. The authors served up a separate story from the book about China’s under-reporting of surging Covid-19 cases.

It was Samantha Maiden political editor of news.com.au who churned out a series of scoops. She revealed on Sunday night that the portfolios that Morrison secretly swore himself into also included the resources portfolio. Now there were three.

“In that case however it was unrelated to the pandemic” Maiden wrote. “It did not occur at the same time as the 2020 changes in the health and finance portfolios.”

It was up to Maiden and Andrew Clennell the political editor of Sky News Australia to reveal on Monday that Cormann in fact did not know about the secret portfolios a crucial detail that was left out of the book.

On the same day on RN Breakfast Patricia Karvelas revealed the prime minister had asked for legal advice about Morrison swearing himself into multiple portfolios and Nationals leader David Littleproud told her what Morrison had done was “pretty ordinary”.

Maiden wrote on Tuesday that in a “stunning journalism fail it appeared that no outlet followed up the Oz scoop for nearly 48 hours” over the weekend.

Breaking: @aclennell reports @MathiasCormann did not know that Scott Morrison had sworn himself in as Finance Minister during the pandemic #auspol — Kieran Gilbert (@Kieran_Gilbert) August 14 2022

It wasn’t until Tuesday’s paper that the Oz grasped the enormity of what they’d been sitting on although Chambers did follow the new developments online on Monday.

Now the Australian was conveying the gravity of Morrison’s actions: “The revelations – in a new book Plagued to be released on Tuesday – have shocked Mr Morrison’s most senior Coalition colleagues – including now Liberal leader Peter Dutton – who say they were blindsided by the former prime minister’s actions and opposition MPs are demanding he explain himself.”

Even the now prime minister commented on the way the story was handled saying he was stunned “it wasn’t front page of every newspaper on Sunday”.

“Because I found those revelations quite extraordinary” he said.

BREAKING: Former Finance Minister Matthias Cormann was NEVER told PM has sworn himself into his portfolio. Only found out when read it in paper this weekend https://t.co/EpBreosYij — Samantha Maiden (@samanthamaiden) August 14 2022

There has been some criticism of the authors for sitting on the dynamite revelations for two years especially as the news may have affected the way the public voted in the election. The fact that Bridget McKenzie confirmed in January 2021 that she was in a relationship with Benson has added to the intrigue of who knew what when. The Nationals senator and former minister has been interviewed and called the developments “concerning” but has not been asked when she knew.

It's astonishing that journalists sat on this news for a book published after Morrison's term is over rather than recognising it as the momentous front page bombshell it was at the time #auspol — Sarah Holland-Batt (@the_shb) August 17 2022

It is common for journalists to hold back material for a book especially if they gave the subject an undertaking.

However such an undertaking may prevent political journalists from informing their readers about something which is in their interest to know.

Asked on Sky News by Kieran Gilbert when he and Benson became aware of the secret portfolios a question which was raised by Albanese Chambers said: “Well we spoke to dozens of people over two years and this was part of the story and well the story is out now. So that’s my response.”

Outfoxed

It’s not the first time Foxtel boss Patrick Delany has made a silly remark while giving a speech at an event.

Hosting a red carpet premiere in Sydney for HBO’s House of the Dragon the Game of Thrones prequel Delany said he was initially bemused when he heard about Game of Thrones and said “What’s this show with the dumpy-looking girl who walks into the flames?”

Delany has apologised saying the comments were meant to be “self-deprecating and lighthearted”.

It’s not as off-colour as the recent gaffe but in 2018 Delany raised eyebrows at another event when he admitted he’d never heard of another HBO show Barry an American black comedy which was running on Foxtel. “I didn’t even know about that show and I’m the CEO of Foxtel!”

Gender reveal

When ABC broadcaster Caroline Jones who died this year aged 80 was appointed to anchor Four Corners 50 years ago the headline was “Girl will take over Four Corners”.

That is no doubt why Jones was the driving force behind the establishment of Women In Media a not-for-profit organisation that assists with scholarships mentoring and post-maternity reskilling sessions for women in the business.

The first Women in Media Industry Insight Report released this week found more than one in two women think media bosses are still not serious about gender equity and an above average 16% weekly earnings pay gap persists between men and women in the sector.

According to Victoria Laurie the national co-patron women have long overtaken men among graduates of journalism schools yet 56% of surveyed members wonder where their careers are going. “They are dissatisfied with their advancement and see lack of opportunity as leading to male-dominated senior roles” Laurie said.

News Corp axe falls

Despite reporting an almost doubling of profits in 2021-22 to a record US$760m (A$1.1bn) this month Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation has taken an axe to the Australian newspaper business.

Weekly Beast can reveal News Corp Australia has identified 15 editorial positions as redundant: five at the Australian; two at the Daily Telegraph three at the Herald Sun two at the News Network and three in the production hub.

A News Corp spokesman declined to comment.

At the same time the editor-in-chief of the Australian Christopher Dore is losing a sizeable chunk of his senior staff who have each clocked up decades with the paper.

The redundancies across the group coincide with the departure of several veterans some of whom put their hands up for a package including the sports editor Wally Mason; the Melbourne-based business columnist Richard Gluyas; and the editorial writer and unofficial transgender issues correspondent Bernard Lane.

The editor of the Weekend Australian Magazine Christine Middap is stepping down and taking up a writing role and Alice Workman who was the editor of a daily column Strewth is leaving the paper.

We hadn’t noticed that Strewth once a must-read column when it was written by James Jeffrey who is now Anthony Albanese’s speechwriter has not appeared in print since 6 May. It was put on ice after the election and then quietly put to sleep.

Dore has been approached for comment.

No joke

News Corp will stop printing comic strips once a staple of the daily print newspapers in all its newspapers from 11 September.

The Australian cartoonists who will lose their gigs are Jason Chatfield (Ginger Meggs) Gary Clark (Swamp) Tony Lopes (Insanity Streak) and Allan Salisbury (Snake Tales).

The rest are US syndicated strips.

A spokesperson for News Corp said it was a reflection of the changing readership habits as audiences are more interested in puzzles games and crosswords.

“Our editorial cartoonists remain as loved and valued as ever and continue to play a critical role in both our print editions and increasingly in our digital growth strategy” he said. “It also reflects a worldwide trend where the audience for comic strips has moved to movies and events rather than newspapers.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vanVua2VlLmNvbS9zb25ueS1iaWxsLXdpbGxpYW1zLWhpamFiLzMzOTI0MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,News Corp Slammed For Disrespectful Old Photo Of Sonny Bill Williams' Wife,"""It's absolutely creepy behaviour toward a Muslim woman.""

News Corp is being criticised after using old revealing photos of Sonny Bill Williams’ wife for a story about her decision to wear a hijab.

Online masthead news.com.au wrote about an Instagram post the New Zealand boxer and former NRL player shared on Thursday of wife Alana Williams and their four young kids.

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sonny Bill Williams (@sonnybillwilliams)

“My wife’s a hijabi! Alhambudillilah my wife decided to put the head scarf on” wrote the 37-year-old. “One of the proudest moments of my life.”

“What makes it so special is knowing she has done it for Allah SWT and no one else” he said. “May the most high always bless you with good health plenty of wisdom contentment and happiness.”

However in the leading image the News Corp outlet posted a side-by-side of Alana Williams in the hijab with a photo of her in a gold bikini from her time working in nightclubs and included an additional picture of her in the costume being held by a male dance partner.

The Murdoch Media will always be scum. Sonny Bill Williams happily posted about his wife wearing the hijab and they decide to post revealing pictures of her past work before she became Muslim defeating the purpose of women wearing the hijab. Pure scum. — Hanan Dover (@HananDover1) August 18 2022

The Daily Mail parasitically latched on to the backlash like maggots drawn to poo using the same unearthed images and also referring to Williams’ past as a “womaniser”.

Under Islamic faith women who wear the hijab can only have their hair seen by certain men in their lives — including their husband relatives and pre-pubescent boys. It is therefore insensitive to post or share old photos of a Muslim woman with her hair visible once she becomes a hijabi.

“This is pretty awful nobody deserves to have images of their past that don’t reflect who they are now circulated by a media organisation” wrote journalist Najma Sambul on Twitter. “It’s absolutely creepy behaviour toward a Muslim woman.”

“All strength and power to Sonny Bill Williams and his wife Alana who have been ridiculed by news.com.au for practicing their faith” said Sambul. “That article was so wrong on many levels.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxlc3RhdGUuY29tLmF1L25ld3MvZGFyaXVzLWFuZC1rYXlsYS1ib3lkcy1kcmVhbS1ob21lLWNyZWF0aW9uLXJpc2VzLTEwMDAtYS1kYXktaW4tdmFsdWUtc2VsbHMtZm9yLTI4bS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Darius and Kayla Boyd's dream home creation rises $1000 a day in value sells for $2.8m - realestate.com.au,"Broncos legend Darius Boyd had made a tidy profit on his ‘dream home’.

Retired NRL legend Darius Boyd and wife Kayla who make millions flipping luxury rebuilds have a new feather in their caps after their first home’s value grew by over $1000 a day.

The Boyds’ first dream home creation sold in an offmarket deal for $2.815m Place Ascot and Nundah director Drew Davies confirmed.

The Boyds had started out with a rundown 1955 three bedroom home at 78 Harding Street Hendra which they bought for $810000 four years after they married.

They then proceeded with brainstorming and approvals with the help of Base Architecture for design and Graya Construction for building – transforming the property into a striking black-on-black designer home.

Mr Davies sold the property for the couple sealing a deal just as Covid-19 began to break out across the country getting the Boyds a $1.86m price in February 2020.

“I sold it originally for $1.86m and then I just resold it offmarket at $2.815m. I also sold their new place (in Paddington) for $4.2m so they’ve seen the benefit of the market growth as well as their buyer” Mr Davies said.

“If anything it goes to show that Darius and Kayla have good vision.”

The director said she had been dealing with the buyer of the Hendra home for eight months “showing them property after property”.

“I approached the owner of that property and said I’ve got a buyer who would be interested.”

The deal was sealed cementing a price rise of over $31000 a month for the home.

“Anything that’s new product or freshly renovated is seeing strong interest” Mr Davies said

Celebrating 50000 vaccine doses given at the SuperVax vaccine clinic on Amazon’s Seattle campus

Amazon and Virginia Mason Franciscan Health are celebrating a milestone in COVID-19 vaccinations. On April 24 the 50000th vaccine dose was administered at the SuperVax vaccine clinic at the Amazon Meeting Center in Seattle.

In addition to the clinic in Seattle Amazon has collaborated with Arlington County Health and JBG Smith on a clinic at its HQ2 location in Arlington Virginia. Since March 29 more than 14000 doses have been administered at this location.

Amazon has also been providing surge support to the Washington State Department of Health’s 2-1-1 call center amid a spike in COVID-19 questions. The center was overloaded with wait times of up to an hour and a backlog of 4500 voicemails until a new system using Amazon volunteers and Amazon Connect technology was launched in March. The center has since processed over 100000 calls. The center also eliminated wait times by immediately connecting callers to a response system that uses the same natural language-understanding technology that powers Alexa.

Amazon updates return to office guidance

Today we shared this update with our teams globally:

Many of you have been asking for some guidance around returning to the office so you can better plan the next several months (including school plans for those with kids). We wanted to share our thinking and provide an update beyond the June 30 guidance we’ve provided to date.

Our plan is to return to an office-centric culture as our baseline. We believe it enables us to invent collaborate and learn together most effectively.

The timelines for returning to the office will vary by country depending on the infection and vaccination rates and we expect our return to the office to be gradual. In many parts of Asia our employees are already back in the office. In the U.S. as vaccines become broadly available in the next few months we expect more people will start coming into the office through the summer with most back in the office by early fall. In some countries in Europe we expect in-person working to take longer given recent setbacks. As we get closer to the summer we’ll develop more country-specific plans and post all updates to Inside Amazon under Local News.

As a reminder Amazon offices remain open and about 10% of our corporate population currently works from an office each day. Restaurants cafes and shops in our buildings are planning to re-open soon as well. As always we maintain strong safety protocols such as temperature screenings upon entry physical distancing guidelines face covering requirements office occupancy limits and enhanced cleaning in all offices. As we transition back to the office please continue to follow health authority and local government guidelines.

The health and safety of our employees is and has been our top priority as we’ve thought about how and where people should work during the pandemic. Over the past year teams have done incredible work under difficult circumstances and we’ve learned a lot about the pros and cons of remote work. We look forward to the day in the not-too-distant future when we can again invent together—safely and in person—on behalf of customers.

Amazon Web Services helps customers developing COVID-19 test result notification systems

Several AWS customers are working on ways to reduce the spread of COVID-19 by developing systems that can instantly notify patients of their test results and monitor how the virus is spreading. In New South Wales (NSW) Australia NSW Health Pathology developed an SMS (text message) solution that reduced wait times for negative test results from 7 days to within hours of a patient taking a test. By automating this process NSW Health Pathology has saved the equivalent of three years' worth of time—the time individually contacting tens of thousands of people with their negative test results would have taken. New Zealand’s Orion Health which develops software to improve healthcare outcomes for more than 100 million patients developed a pandemic monitoring platform to help providers identify and curate lists of patients—both COVID-19 negative and positive—who would benefit from active monitoring or care and tracking their ongoing progress.

Improving the COVID-19 patient experience

COVID-19 patients are often cut off from visitors making it challenging to keep family members up-to-date on the health of their loved ones and leaving patients feeling isolated. AWS customers have stepped in to offer solutions EASE Applications sends HIPAA-compliant text updates to families from the emergency room operating room intensive care unit and medical floor. During the COVID-19 crisis the company is using Amazon Chime SDK to incorporate two-way video communication into its mobile apps so that families of COVID-19 patients have reliable remote communication with the patients and their doctors. CareMonitor a provider of remote health monitoring expanded its platform to monitor the daily health status of COVID-19 patients with low-level symptoms so they can recover from the virus in their own homes. In the CareMonitor app patients are asked daily symptom questions and collect biometric data like temperature heart rate and oxygen saturation to gauge their current health status. The app is integrated with Amazon Chime a set of real-time communications components to send messages and connect via video to health care providers. Current Health is enabling more than 40 hospitals and care facilities in the UK and U.S. to free up beds applying its remote monitoring technology to track patients' vital signs outside of the hospital or clinic. Using a medical device that patients wear on their arms clinicians can continuously monitor patients who are at risk of deteriorating enabling them to perform triage and consult with patients over video.

Nepal has signed a pact with an Indian company to develop a hydroelectric plant in the west of the nation years after a Chinese firm backed out officials said.

Nepal has opened its rivers which it sees as having a combined potential to generate more than 42000 megawatts of hydroelectric power to foreign players to develop its economy and export electricity to narrow the trade deficit of more than $13bn.

Officials said India’s NHPC Ltd signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on Thursday allowing it to study details like feasibility environmental effects inundation of land and construction costs for two projects – West Seti (750 megawatts) and SR 6 (450 megawatts).

Both plants are to be located on the West Seti River in Nepal’s least-developed far western region.

China’s biggest hydropower developer Three Gorges International Corp was previously lined up to develop the West Seti plant but Nepal scrapped the deal in 2017 amid haggling over the terms officials said.

“After decades of delays we would not have plunged into another uncertainty” chief executive officer Sushil Bhatta of the state-run Investment Board Nepal told Reuters news agency.

“NHPC has a good track record of developing such projects in similar terrain in neighbouring areas in India and has the potential to ensure India’s market for electricity” he said adding that he hoped for more projects in the region.

Abhay Kumar Singh managing director of NHPC Ltd was similarly optimistic. “When we enter a project we complete it” he said.

India is already constructing a 900-megawatt hydropower project on the Arun River in eastern Nepal at a cost of $1.04bn.

China and India usually jostle for influence in Nepal.

Currently Nepal generates about 2000 megawatts or less than five percent of its total hydroelectric potential due to a lack of funds technical know-how and the absence of political consensus on how to develop the resource.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vanVua2VlLmNvbS9zb25ueS1iaWxsLXdpbGxpYW1zLWhpamFiLzMzOTI0MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,News Corp Slammed For Disrespectful Old Photo Of Sonny Bill Williams' Wife,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vanVua2VlLmNvbS9zb25ueS1iaWxsLXdpbGxpYW1zLWhpamFiLzMzOTI0MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159B8D1F820>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vanVua2VlLmNvbS9zb25ueS1iaWxsLXdpbGxpYW1zLWhpamFiLzMzOTI0MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Ground zero in the conflict is Wyoming a stronghold for golden eagles that soar on 7-foot (2-meter) wings and a favored location for wind farms. As wind turbines proliferate scientists say deaths from collisions could drive down golden eagle numbers considered stable at best.

Yet climate change looms as a potentially greater threat: Rising temperatures are projected to reduce golden eagle breeding ranges by more than 40% later this century according to a National Audubon Society analysis.

That leaves golden eagles doubly vulnerable — to the shifting climate and to the wind energy promoted as a solution to that warming world.

""We have some of the best golden eagle populations in Wyoming but it doesn't mean the population is not at risk"" said Bryan Bedrosian conservation director at the Teton Raptor Center in Wilson Wyoming. ""As we increase wind development across the U.S. that risk is increasing.""

Turbine blades hundreds of feet long are among myriad threats to golden eagles which are routinely shot poisoned by lead hit by vehicles and electrocuted on power lines.

The tenuous position of golden eagles contrasts with the conservation success of their avian cousins bald eagles whose numbers have quadrupled since 2009. There are an estimated 346000 bald eagles in the U.S. versus about 40000 golden eagles which need much larger areas to survive and are more inclined to have trouble with humans.

Federal officials have tried to curb turbine deaths while avoiding any slowdown in the growth of wind power as an alternative to carbon-emitting fossil fuels — a key piece of President Joe Biden's climate agenda.

In April a Florida-based power company pleaded guilty in federal court in Wyoming to criminal violations of wildlife protection laws after its wind turbines killed more than 100 golden eagles in eight states. It was the third conviction of a major wind company for killing eagles in a decade.

Despite the deaths scientists like Bedrosian say more turbines are needed to fight climate change. He and colleague Charles Preston are finding ways wind companies can reduce or offset eagle deaths such as building in areas less frequented by the birds improving habitat elsewhere or retrofitting power poles to make them less perilous when eagles land.

""It's robbing Peter to pay Paul but it's a start and I think it's the way to go"" Preston said. ""It's a societal question: Is there room for them and us? It's not just golden eagles. They are kind of a window into the bigger picture.""

Dangling from a rope 30 feet (9 meters) above the ground with a canvas bag slung around his neck Bedrosian shouldered his way into a golden eagle nest lodged in a cliff ledge in northwestern Wyoming. As an adult eagle circled in the distance the scientist made an awkward grab for the young eagle in the nest slid a leather hood over its head then wrestled the bird into the bag.

The 6-week-old bird was lowered and carefully extracted by Preston a zip tie around its feet as a precaution against talons more than an inch long.

""The key is not to forget later to cut the zip tie"" Bedrosian said.

The eaglet went on a scale — about 7 pounds (3.2 kilograms). Bedrosian drew some blood from a wing to test for lead exposure and Preston clamped onto each leg a metal band with numbers for identification if the eagle's recaptured or found dead.

Golden eagles don't mate until about 5 years old and produce about one chick every two years so adult eagle deaths have outsized impacts on the population Bedrosian said.

Illegal shootings are the biggest cause of death killing about 700 golden eagles annually according to federal estimates. More than 600 die annually in collisions with cars wind turbines and power lines; about 500 annually are electrocuted and more than 400 are poisoned.

""Wind mortality wasn't a thing for golden eagles 10 years ago"" Bedrosian said. ""I don't want to pick on wind as the only thing. ... But it's the additive nature of all these things and several are increasing. Vehicle strikes are increasing. Climate change is increasing. Wind is increasing.""

Federal officials won't divulge how many eagles are reported killed by wind farms saying it's sensitive law enforcement information. The recent criminal prosecution of a subsidiary of NextEra Energy one of the largest U.S. renewable energy providers offered a glimpse into the problem's scope.

The company pleaded guilty to three counts of violating the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and was ordered to pay more than $8 million in fines and restitution after killing at least 150 eagles — including more than 100 goldens at wind farms in Wyoming California New Mexico North Dakota Colorado Michigan Arizona and Illinois.

Government officials said the mortality was likely higher because some turbines killed multiple eagles and carcasses are not always found.

Prosecutors said the company's failure to take steps to protect eagles or to obtain permits to kill the birds gave it an advantage over competitors that did take such steps — even as NextEra and affiliates received hundreds of millions of dollars in federal tax credits for wind power.

The company remained defiant after the plea deal: NextEra President Rebecca Kujawa said bird collisions with turbines were unavoidable accidents that should not be criminalized.

Utilities Duke Energy and PacifiCorp previously pleaded guilty to similar charges in Wyoming. North Carolina-based Duke Energy was sentenced in 2013 to $1 million in fines and restitution and five years probation following deaths of 14 golden eagles and 149 other birds at two of the company's wind projects.

A year later Oregon-based PacifiCorp received $2.5 million in fines and five years probation after 38 golden eagle carcasses and 336 other protected birds were discovered at two of its sites.

The number of wind turbines nationwide more than doubled over the past decade to almost 72000 according to U.S. Geological Survey data with development overlapping prime golden eagle territory in states including Wyoming Montana California Washington and Oregon.

USGS scientists concluded in a recent study that if anticipated growth in wind energy by 2040 occurs increased turbine-caused deaths could cut golden eagle populations by almost half over 10 years.

However the fact that no population-wide declines have been seen in recent years suggests some uncertainty in the projections. said lead author Jay Diffendorfer.

Federal wildlife officials are pushing wind companies to enroll in a permitting program that allows them to kill eagles if the deaths are offset.

Companies with permits can pay utilities to retrofit power poles so lines are spaced far enough that eagles can't be easily electrocuted. Every 11 poles retrofitted typically means one eagle death avoided annually.

Nationwide 34 permits in place last year authorized companies to ""take"" 170 golden eagles — meaning that many birds could be killed by turbines or lost through impacts on nests or habitat.

For each loss companies are responsible for ensuring at least one eagle death is avoided somewhere else. Using conservative estimates that overcount potential deaths could even mean a gain of eagles in the long run said Brian Millsap who heads the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's eagle program.

""This sounds crass but it's realistic. Eagles are going to be incidentally killed at wind farms"" he said. ""We've got to reduce other things that will allow wind energy development.""

Agency officials would not disclose which companies hold permits. An Associated Press public records review shows most are wind farms.

Federal officials collect golden eagle death data through an online reporting system used by government agencies companies scientists tribes and private groups.

Fish and Wildlife Service officials declined to release the data because they said it could be used in future law enforcement cases.

The nests where Bedrosian and Preston are doing population studies are about 60 miles (96 kilometers) from the nearest wind farm — 114 turbines that PacifiCorp began operating about two years ago near the Wyoming-Montana border.

Personnel on site scan the skies with binoculars for eagles and can shut down turbines when the birds approach.

""We tend to see more golden eagles in prairie areas where you're going to have the best wind regimes"" said Travis Brown a biologist with PacifiCorp. ""It's almost like competition for the wind resource because the birds are using it for movement.""

Ten PacifiCorp wind farms have permits authorizing the incidental killing of eagles and an application is pending for two more the company said.

Company representatives declined to say how many eagles have died under its federal permits. They said PacifiCorp's been building a ""bank"" of retrofitted power poles to offset eagle deaths and also wants to try new approaches such as painting turbine blades to be more visible and easier to avoid.

Can the Color Make a Comeback (Again)?,"Pink for as long as it’s been around is still a hotly contested color. Headlines aplenty ponder whether men should wear it still…even though they have been for decades if not centuries. In fact in a widely circulated trade journal published in 1918 pink was the de-facto color for boys everywhere.

“If you go back to the 18th century little boys and little girls of the upper classes both wore pink and blue and other colors uniformly” Valerie Steele director of the Museum at FIT the Fashion Institute of Technology told CNN. Later on though manufacturers made a push to codify color codes. “In America by the 1890s and the early 20th century manufacturers attempted to sell more children’s and infants’ clothes by color-coding them.”

Consensus was divided still though on which corresponded with which gender pole. Popular lore attributes the final verdict to the high-profile acquisition of two pieces of 18th century art Steele explains to CNN a painting of a boy in blue called Boy in Blue and a painting of a young girl wearing a pink dress called Pinkie.

Ever since pink has sustained through subversion: “Real men wear pink” and “Who cares? Wear what you like” represent two widely-held sentiments about the hue. Popular in prep circles and in streetwear pink thrives as an extremity: a bright pink polo with navy slacks or bright pink accents on an otherwise all-black or all-white sneaker. Nike however is testing our tolerance for rose-colored sneakers with its upcoming release calendar.

Although one has already come out the Stüssy x Nike Air Max 2013 Nike is readying three more pink sneakers for later this year: the expressive Nike Air Pesto ‘Triple Pink’ and Nike Air Max 270 ‘Triple Pink’ as well as the tame Nike Air Force 1 ‘Low Desert Berry’ (seen above). There are also two more sneakers with pink accents a new Air Max 95 with pink laces and pink foam plus an Air Pegasus with (kind of random) pink laces. Are they for everyone? Well no but there’s certainly something to Nike’s new penchant.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vc25lYWtlcmJhcmRldHJvaXQuY29tL25pa2UtZHVuay1sb3ctd2hpdGUtc2FpbC1kZDE1MDMtMTIxLXJlbGVhc2UtZGF0ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike Dunk Low White Sail WMNS DD1503-121 Release Date | SBD,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vc25lYWtlcmJhcmRldHJvaXQuY29tL25pa2UtZHVuay1sb3ctd2hpdGUtc2FpbC1kZDE1MDMtMTIxLXJlbGVhc2UtZGF0ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159B6BD7280>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vc25lYWtlcmJhcmRldHJvaXQuY29tL25pa2UtZHVuay1sb3ctd2hpdGUtc2FpbC1kZDE1MDMtMTIxLXJlbGVhc2UtZGF0ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVyc2UuY29tL2lucHV0L3N0eWxlL25pa2UtYWRpZGFzLWxhd3N1aXQtZmx5a25pdC1wcmltZWtuaXQtc2V0dGxlbWVudNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike and Adidas settle a lawsuit over Flyknit technology,"Nike and Adidas have settled a lawsuit over their respective knit footwear technology. In a lawsuit filed in December Nike accused Adidas of making unauthorized use of its “game-changing” and patent-protected Flyknit technology. According to The Fashion Law the two parties have now informed the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon that they’ve reached a private settlement in which they each cover their own attorney fees and costs.

It’s a well-known fact that Nike isn’t afraid to take anyone to court: In the last year alone the sportswear company has sued small-time customizers designer John Geiger and reselling platform StockX — all in the interest of protecting its intellectual property. And when it comes to the brand’s Flyknit a feature it spent more than a decade and upwards of $100 million dollars researching and developing Nike is fiercely defensive. The brand alleged that Adidas challenged its patents associated with its Flyknit technology for “much of the past decade” writes TFL alleging the German brand continued to use Nike’s patented technology without permission through Adidas’s Primeknit.

What happened — In the since-settled case nine of Nike’s 300-or-so utility patents for Flyknit were violated by many of Adidas’s “so-called ‘Primeknit’ shoes” the Swoosh alleged. According to the brand’s complaint Adidas announced its Primeknit shoes only five months after Nike announced Flyknit and the industry “immediately took note of the similarities between Nike’s patented Flyknit technology and the adidas Primeknit offerings.” Both use yarns made of recycled materials to knit a sneaker’s upper.

Nike Inc. v. adidas AG 3:21-cv-01780 (D. Or.).

The similarities between Flyknit and Primeknit however weren’t necessarily what Nike took issue with in the resolved case. Rather Nike complained that while Adidas could’ve sought to license its Flyknit patents it instead opted to challenge several of them all while marketing its allegedly infringing Primeknit sneakers. As such Nike sought injunctive relief and enhanced damages for its nine claims of patent infringement but ultimately reached a settlement with Adidas.

An ongoing suit — There’s much more than one legal battle between the two brands though. Earlier this year Adidas filed suit against Nike and claimed the company infringed on nine of its patents pertaining to mobile applications and smart technology. The pair has also been tangled in a lawsuit spanning almost a decade fighting over Nike’s 2013 patent concerning its “Knitted Textile Upper Family.”

Per TFL Adidas argued against the patent the same year it was filed pointing to earlier art and claiming Nike shouldn’t be the sole owner of “single flat-knit textile elements.” The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit agreed with Adidas but the lawsuit has been drawn out as Nike continues to try to patent its knit uppers under other wording. As Nike has proven brands don’t become industry leaders without protecting (or monopolizing?) their property.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vaG9uZWhlYWx0aC5jb20vZWRnZS9saWZlc3R5bGUvbmlrZS16b29tLXgtdmFwb3JmbHktbmV4dC0yLXJldmlldy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vaporfly Review: Nike Zoom X Vaporfly Next%2 Running Shoes,"We all have our vices. For some it’s expensive cars for others gambling and then there’s me: running shoes. I never intended to burn small fortunes on something that simply gets me from point A to B but after I slipped into my first pair of the Nike Zoom X Vaporfly 2 I knew I was a goner.

My initial few steps may have been all Bambi legs and headlights (they’re literally shaped like a rocking horse to propel you forward) but I quickly slipped into a natural cadence. Running at my usual 9-minute mile pace felt good but when I rolled up the speed to a 7-minute mile pace it felt great.

The clash of speed and ease force and grace—things I rarely experience in tandem on a run—didn’t go unnoticed.

So began my love affair with the Vaporfly.

My husband claims they’re cheating (and as a lifelong runner and a running shoe tech we value his opinion)—they’re too fast too aggressive he says. And he’s not alone. Many people argue their efficiency is considered “technology doping.”

But if the Vaporfly is wrong I don’t want to be right. It’s a bitching shoe. One that all runners owe themselves to experience at least once."

Neither railroad has been able to handle freight demand and both have lost traffic to trucks as on-time performance has faltered.

But NS CEO Alan Shaw says service improvements over the past month have prompted some carload shippers to divert loads back to rail. “They’re talking to us about transitioning more business back to Norfolk Southern” he says.

NS now has 260 more conductors on duty than it did in May and has more than 800 in training classes.

The new hires have helped improve operations. “Our train speed is at levels we haven’t seen in over a year and our terminal dwell is now at the best levels it’s been at this entire year” Shaw told an investor conference this week.

Shaw emphasized that while he’s encouraged by the railroad’s progress NS’s service is nowhere near where it needs to be. A return to 2019 operational performance he says likely won’t come until late this year or early next year.

The railroad’s new operating plan TOP | SPG “is about optimizing our most precious resource which is crews” Shaw says. Since the railroad began to roll out the new plan in June the number of unplanned recrews has fallen substantially he notes.

Shaw credits the operational improvements to the railroad’s focus on hiring the new operating plan and new operating department leadership.

NS reactivated idled humps at its classification yards in Macon Ga. and Bellevue Ohio as part of TOP | SPG. When there’s enough traffic density using humps to classify traffic is more efficient than flat-switching and can help ease congestion Shaw says. Cars are spending 18% less time at Macon now than they did prior to the resumption of hump operations he notes.

Kevin Boone CSX’s executive vice president of sales and marketing says conductor training classes are “bursting and the seams” with a record number of people in the railroad’s Atlanta training center.

CSX’s crew availability problems have shifted. Six to nine months ago the South was the hardest hit area but now the Midwest and Northeast are the hot spots. Hiring has helped in the South Boone says and the railroad expects northern areas to improve after Labor Day due to a combination of hiring and fewer workers taking vacations.

CSX’s intermodal traffic is running well Boone says but merchandise and bulk operations remain challenged. “There’s no question we’re not where we want to be from a service level” Boone told the investor conference.

Once the railroad’s staffing levels are back to full strength CSX expects to be able to gain new intermodal and merchandise volume Boone says. “I think we are on the cusp of that” he adds.

There are strong opportunities to convert freight from truck to rail partly due to high diesel fuel prices that have a larger impact on truckers than railroads. “We truly believe there’s a big opportunity out there almost across every market” Boone says.

Both railroads say that factors outside their control — from a lack of chassis for international containers to slow and unreliable interchanges with the western railroads — are hampering their service.

Last week NS delivered 63% of its carload traffic within 24 hours of the original estimated time of arrival up from 52% in May according to the latest data reported to the Surface Transportation Board. Intermodal traffic is running 96% on time.

CSX meanwhile reported that 70% of its merchandise traffic was delivered within 24 hours of when promised up from 66% in May. CSX reported that 99% of its intermodal trains were on time.

It's easy and will only take a moment.

A MUM from Elgin says that her trust in Dr Gray's Hospital has been broken after she was forced to rush her son to Aberdeen for lifesaving treatment.

Lyle with David his dad mum Nicola and his sister Lacey.

Nicola McLellan's son Lyle (6) suffers from a rare bowel condition called Hirschsprung's disease. If left untreated he can become seriously ill very quickly.

On July 10 this year Nicola took Lyle to Dr Gray's for treatment. He received his usual round of fluids and was sent home after his condition improved.

However Lyle had to be taken back to the hospital on July 11 July 12 and July 13. On each occasion Nicola says that the paediatrician told her that Lyle looked ""clinically fine"" before sending them home without treatment.

""Because of his condition it's important that Lyle gets the treatment he needs when he needs it"" Nicola said.

""That's why he has an advanced clinical care practitioner in place at Dr Gray's and a plan in place for his treatment.

""But he didn't get that treatment from the paediatrician on the Monday Tuesday or Wednesday when he had got it from a different paediatrician on the Sunday.

""I made it clear that he needed his fluids but they just kept telling me he looked clinically fine.

""They also failed to contact Aberdeen as Lyle is under their care to let them know about any of this.""

Lyle after receiving fluids on July 10. Nicola says that his condition became worse over the next three days.

Nicola says that she contacted Aberdeen Royal Infirmary herself after becoming increasingly concerned about Lyle's condition.

Within minutes of sending a photo of Lyle Nicola was advised to get him to Aberdeen immediately for treatment.

A chaotic journey from Elgin to Aberdeen followed with Nicola describing it as one of the ""scariest experiences"" of her life.

""I was driving him but he was obviously deteriorating very quickly"" Nicola said.

""Eventually I pulled over in Huntly because it wasn't safe for me Lyle or other people on the road.

""At that point I phoned 999 and an ambulance arrived to take us the rest of the way.

""They were great because up until that point I had just felt totally alone after essentially being rejected by Dr Gray's but they reassured me and kept me calm.""

Lyle was treated for strep throat as well as three infections in his stomach at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary - all of which had not been diagnosed at Dr Gray's Hospital.

Nicola claims that the oversight could have cost her son his life.

""That was a lot for my son's body to try and fight"" She said.

""He just needed his fluids. Had they done that in Elgin we would never have got to that stage.

""They didn't X-ray to see if there was a blockage in the stomach didn't do the blood work just didn't want to do their job if I'm being totally honest.""

Lyle looking and feeling a lot happier after being treated in Aberdeen.

Lyle has recovered and is back home with Nicola his dad David and his sister Lacey.

And Nicola has since met with representatives from both Dr Gray's and NHS Grampian.

NHS Grampian said that they cannot comment on ""individual patient cases"" but added that steps are always taken to learn from mistakes to ensure they aren't repeated.

A spokesperson for NHS Grampian said: “When a patient or their representative makes direct contact with us we are more than willing to discuss their case with them – including diagnosis treatment and any further care.

“In instances where mistakes are found to be made we apologise to those involved and take steps to learn and avoid recurrences in future.”

However Nicola says they have ""been here before"" after a mix-up at Dr Gray's in 2018 led to Lyle being airlifted to Edinburgh.

Nicola said: ""You would think that they would have learned from it the first time after he ended up on a life support system when Dr Gray's was operating on a reduced service on weekends and the on-call doctor had forgotten to tell people they had swapped their shift.

""It was scarier this time though because it felt like Lyle had been refused treatment and I was totally on my own so I just hope they do learn from it this time.""

Nicola says that although her trust in Dr Gray's has been broken she is hopeful that over time it will return.

""I'm not bashing the NHS"" she added.

""Lyle needs these doctors more than anything but I do need to raise awareness because it could have ended very differently.""

It's safe to say it did not all go according to plan.

Sure some travelers finally made it on their trips of a lifetime many of which had been postponed for years. However an often-debilitating combination of inflation sluggish staffing and Mother Nature not only caused prices to soar but also upended itineraries. This left travelers wondering if services would ever be restored to what was once ""normal.""

While hours-long waits and piles of luggage proved nightmarish for travelers overseas flight disruptions in the U.S. surpassed ordinary frustration. The four biggest U.S. airlines canceled 3% of their flights in June according to data from FlightAware. That might not sound like much but it amounted to more than 11000 flights. And though a handful of U.S. airlines saw cancellations drop in July cancellation rates rose again during the first couple weeks of August.

All the while delays held steady with more than a quarter of flights affected through the summer. Additionally the length of a typical delay has crept upward each month since May to an average of 53 minutes per delay during the first half of August.

The source of the problems is a complex web no doubt. But it has nonetheless sparked finger-pointing.

Now just like Americans have seen at the gas pump there are at least modest signs of relief when it comes to the price you're paying to fly. Recent numbers from booking and airfare analysis site Hopper show August airfare not only down a great deal from earlier this summer but dipping slightly below August 2019 levels.

Likewise far fewer travelers see transportation costs as a key factor in whether to plan a trip than even a month ago according to August survey results shared by Miles Partnership and Longwoods International.

At the same time if you're hoping for a sudden rebound in reliability from airlines you may be waiting a while longer — until 2023 even.

""We're not going to get back to normal utilization and normal staffing levels until next summer"" United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said in a July interview on CNBC.

Experts fear the same could be true for hotels that have yet to restore the full complement of amenities customers enjoyed before COVID-19 stymied travel more than two years ago.

""Most of it will really be driven by the labor situation"" said Karthik Namasivayam a hospitality industry expert as well as professor and department chair of the School of Hospitality Business at Michigan State University's Broad College of Business.

""It's going to take a little longer to figure out exactly where we are"" Namasivayam added in an interview with TPG.

Across the industry things are shifting. But things may not truly get back on track until 2023.

Air travel

There is hope that the airline industry will stage a strong recovery by 2023 — but many factors will likely cause issues for years to come.

Some encouraging signs for air travel

The industry has a good chance of fully recovering its capacity by 2023 leaving consumers with more choices for flights and potentially lower fares. In its most recent guidance United Airlines predicts its full-year 2023 capacity to be up 8% compared to 2019. In the airline industry capacity (a key metric that is also known as available seat miles) is measured by multiplying the number of seats by the number of miles flown.

To operate all those flights the industry will also have more aircraft on hand. Deliveries of Boeing 787 Dreamliners resumed on Aug. 10 — welcome news at American Airlines which had to cut its summer 2022 schedule due to the pause in deliveries of the wide-body aircraft stemming from quality control issues.

United Airlines is in the process of returning 52 of its Boeing 777s to its fleet which had been grounded after a February 2021 incident near Denver and which had negatively affected the airline's schedule.

And Delta Air Lines has finally begun to take delivery of its Airbus A321neos of which it has 155 on order. That aircraft will become an integral part of its fleet for years to come.

U.S. airlines are also hiring more staff: They employed 3.21% more workers in June of this year than they did in June of 2019 according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. As a whole U.S. airlines have avoided many of the staff-induced meltdowns that have plagued airlines in Europe this summer.

Airline staffing problems aren't a quick fix

But there are still some staffing-related issues on the horizon specifically with pilots and air traffic controllers.

A pilot shortage has been exacerbated by the pandemic. As major airlines have had to replace pilots that took early retirement packages a major source of pilots has been regional airlines. This downstream effect has caused regional airlines to shrink and many communities to lose some or all air service during the pandemic — a trend that is expected to continue.

Replacing pilots is not a quick or easy task: The cost of flight training can be more than $100000 and earning the 1500 flight hours required to fly for an airline can be a long slog of low-paying jobs.

Then there's the issue of air traffic controllers. There have been multiple staffing-related issues at ATC facilities across the country in recent months most acutely at a facility near Jacksonville Florida that handles high-altitude traffic.

Hiring and training controllers can be a multi-year process. While the Federal Aviation Administration the employer of the nation's controllers touts strong interest in its job openings (it recently accepted nearly 58000 job applications for 1500 openings) it will be years before those hired will work traffic — and retirements will continue.

So there is hope that 2023 will be a more normal year for airline travel but also some reason to be skeptical too. — By senior aviation reporter Ethan Klapper.

Hotels

The hotel landscape this year is one of sky-high rates and a customer experience that often doesn't match the soaring costs. Hotel owners and the major lodging conglomerates blame it all on everything from labor shortages to supply chain issues.

Travelers were patient and forgiving of service gaps in the early days of the pandemic but that goodwill is wearing thin more than two years later.

Room rates may start to stabilize

Signs indicate the tides are turning at least on pricing. U.S. inflation data released in mid-August shows hotel rates (a major driver of inflation earlier in 2022) declined slightly by 3.2% from June to July. Rates were also only up by 1.3% from a year ago which is a win given hotel rates surged 25.5% from November 2020 to November 2021.

But now is not necessarily the time to wave a victory flag in the name of stabilization for the hotel industry.

Publicly traded hotel company executives signaled during the second-quarter earnings reporting season that they see additional elements in the pandemic recovery that could continue to increase hotel rates. In short: Rates aren't going to settle at a new normal until we see what business and group travel look like in the fall typically when both sectors revive to their peak levels. Further the return of Chinese customers to the global travel sector could send rates higher based on their demand levels.

""We expect the global [performance] recovery to continue each quarter through the end of the year driven by improving occupancy and [average daily rates] compared to 2019"" Leeny Oberg Marriott's chief financial officer said on an August investor call.

A recent U.S. Hotels State of the Union report from CBRE indicated analysts at the real estate brokerage firm a leading player in the hotel transaction space expect daily rate growth to moderate in the back half of this year.

Questionable future for housekeeping and amenities

The biggest question mark rests on customer experience and brands offering consistency across various properties and cities. The major hotel companies like Marriott International and Hilton relaxed brand standards which dictate everything from signage to food and beverage offerings and daily housekeeping during the pandemic to provide owners with some degree of financial relief through the uncertainty and record low-demand levels.

But swelling customer dissatisfaction at hotels (i.e. the hotel experience better start matching the sky-high rates these owners are charging) has the industry bracing for the return of brand standards. Oberg previously indicated Marriott would revive brand standards at some point this year and the rest of the industry is widely expected to follow suit.

This doesn't mean a switch will flip overnight. After all there was a hotel labor shortage prior to the pandemic and the health crisis enabled the hotel industry to step back and figure out where permanent efficiencies could play out.

Daily housekeeping as we knew it will likely never return to the entire industry. The opt-in model already in place at Hilton is probably the new norm. Marriott executives still haven't gone public with their strategy but IHG Hotels & Resorts plans to focus on select areas in daily room ""refreshing.""

It could be years for other elements of the hotel guest experience to stabilize to a consistent product however. The expected return of brand standards likely means widespread orders for new furniture and other fixtures: Eliminating daily housekeeping means accelerated wear and tear on just about everything that goes into a hotel.

But supply chain issues plague the industry already. So imagine the delays sparked by a massive wave of existing hotels suddenly needing new furniture.

""It's already at an all-time level of demand over the last 50 years for hotel capital expenditures and renovations and demand is only going to increase in 2023 and 2024"" said Alan Benjamin founder of leading hotel furniture fixture and equipment procurement firm Benjamin West.

On the other hand new hotels are opening left and right that were delayed during the pandemic — and then delayed again for a slew of reasons like the aforementioned labor shortages and supply issues. These new hotels range from budget-friendly accommodations to the most luxe of luxury hotels.

The good news is that whenever rates do finally start to soften there are plenty of exciting new hotels to visit on every corner of the planet.

The only question is will the experts who think we'll soon see rates taper off in the fall be right or are we in for another round of questioning how anyone can afford the vacations they're posting about online? — By senior hotel reportersTanner Saunders and Cameron Sperance.

Cruises

Even cruise lines which hire employees for their ships from around the world have been facing a worker shortage in some cases — though not on a scale that could cause a huge effect on the passenger experience.

Cruise staffing has affected services somewhat

Among the lines that have been the most affected by staffing issues are Carnival Cruise Line which has had to cut back the hours of some onboard dining venues on ships due to a lack of enough workers and Princess Cruises. The latter canceled more than two months' worth of sailings out of San Diego on short notice due to what it called ""labor challenges.""

Still cruise industry executives suggest they're not facing the same sort of worker shortages found at some hotels and airlines.

""The internationally sourced crew that makes up the abundance of our staffing on board it's pretty back to normal"" Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings president and CEO Frank Del Rio said during a recent conference call with Wall Street analysts. Del Rio noted that only one of the company's 28 ships was having significant trouble maintaining proper staffing levels the Hawaii-based Pride of America.

The U.S.-flagged ship is unique among vessels in the company's fleet in that it must operate with mostly American workers by law due to its all-U.S. itinerary and U.S. workers right now are particularly hard to come by he suggested.

""We are having issues sourcing labor and crew for that [one] vessel"" Del Rio said. ""We've purposely kept the load factor since she's returned to service at 40% ... because of labor shortages.""

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings is the parent company of Norwegian Cruise Line Regent Seven Seas Cruises and Oceania Cruises. Like Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings most cruise companies that have faced worker shortages for specific ships have chosen to operate them at a lower passenger occupancy or cancel their sailings outright to ensure that service levels on the vessels remain at normal levels rather than operate a diminished product.

Even the most budget-focused cruise lines have notably maintained twice-a-day room cleaning on vessels throughout the pandemic — a sharp difference from the diminished service levels seen at hotels on land. — By Gene Sloan principal writer cruise and travel.

Bottom line

While COVID-19 was the common thread that connected the challenges across various sectors of the travel industry in 2020 and 2021 in 2022 it was a combination of high costs and lackluster service sparked by everything from low staffing levels to supply chain tie-ups.

Are some of the changes we've seen unfold over the last couple of years permanent? Perhaps some experts say.

""It's a question of consumers becoming used to the new normal"" said Namasivayam the Michigan State hospitality expert. ""I suspect some of this is going to remain the same going forward.""

Whether you're flying staying in a hotel taking a cruise or all of the above there are reasons to be optimistic that improvements could be around the corner. At the same time the complex nature of the problems makes it likely travelers could continue to feel the effects well into 2023.

Auburn kicked off the 2022 season with a 1-0 victory over Old Dominion thanks to a decisive goal from junior midfielder Anna Haddock.

“""Tonight was a really good start"" Haddock said. ""Under the circumstances we rose through the adversity. There were some really promising things out there. I think if the ball bounces a couple of different ways then the score sheet looks a little different. The grit and overall determination are something we can build on.""

The Tigers didn't come in expecting an easy win in the season opener as Old Dominion who is spending its first season in the Sun Belt was picked to win the eastern division of its conference.

Last season the Monarchs won the Conference USA Tournament on its way to its second NCAA Tournament appearance in program history.

Furthermore Auburn was without head coach Karen Hoppa due to illness and also missing sophomore defender LJ Knox. Associate head coach Ben Madsen served as the head coach for the season opener and the defense had no trouble shutting out Old Dominion.

“First off we're thinking about LJ and obviously Coach (Hoppa)"" Madsen said. ""It's been a long couple of days but I think the kids responded with their play and we're real proud of them. Tonight I saw a team that showed grit fight and never gave up. That's all we ask for.""

Auburn had its fair number of chances within the first 10 minutes but was unable to find the net. Haddock had her first shot from the top of the box saved while redshirt junior Marissa Arias saw her prime chance of a goal fade as a heavy touch forced her into a shot off target.

Old Dominion finally recorded its first shot 30 minutes into the game after some flashy linkup play saw the Monarchs reach the box but goalkeeper Maddie Prohaska came out of goal to record an easy save near the touchline.

The missed chances for Auburn continued later in the half creating a theme for the Tigers through the first 45 minutes of play.

With six minutes remaining until halftime Sabrina McNeill saw a clever pass fall to her feet at the top of the box but McNeill lost her balance while taking the shot resulting in a weak shot that rolled into Old Dominion’s Erin Jones’ hands for a routine save.

After 45 minutes the whistle sounded and the two teams remained deadlocked without a goal. Auburn attempted five shots in the first half and was in good position for many of them but all fell off target.

Meanwhile the backline for Auburn stood strong holding the Monarchs to three shots with just one on target.

The defense also got involved in the attack with Hailey Whitaker consistently providing some danger at left back - getting up field with some fancy dribbling and feeding the forwards in the middle of the pitch.

The theme of missed opportunities for the Tigers was finally erased inside the first 10 minutes of the second half. After the Monarchs were dispossessed in their own half Haddock corralled the ball and went towards goal.

With her eyes set on giving Auburn the lead the junior blew past her defender and guided one into the left side of the net - rooting the keeper to her spot and putting the Tigers on top 1-0.

Fifteen minutes later Old Dominion won a free kick. In desperate need of a goal the Monarchs worked a tricky free kick to see its best chance of the game.

However the Auburn backline being called upon for the first time in the second half answered the call. They threw their body at the shot blocking it then clearing the ball without surrendering the lead.

For the final 20 minutes the Auburn defense continued its dominating performance - knocking away crosses putting in key tackles to stop in attack and most importantly holding possession to drain the clock and lead Auburn to a season-opening 1-0 win.

The lecture highlights varied and historically specific sovereign arguments made in multiple media by participants in the premodern Pali arena (13th-16th centuries).

Professor Blackburn studies Buddhism in South and Southeast Asia at the intersection of Buddhist institutional history literary studies intellectual history and political economy with a particular interest in Buddhist networks (literary monastic institutional political and trade) linking Sri Lanka and mainland Southeast Asia before and during colonial presence in the region. Her publications include Buddhist Learning and Textual Practice in Eighteenth-Century Lankan Monastic Culture (Princeton 2001) Locations of Buddhism: Colonialism and Modernity in Sri Lanka (Chicago 2010) ""Buddhist Connections in the Indian Ocean"" (JESHO 2015) and ""Buddhist Technologies of Statecraft and Millennial Moments"" (History and Theory 2017).

Her current research focuses on monastic scandals and the monastic body within Thai Buddhism. She is also writing a book on contemporary lived Theravada Buddhism in Southeast Asia.

Blackburn received her MA and PhD from the University of Chicago mentored by Frank Reynolds in a program shaped by historical sociology and hermeneutics. Her secondary supervisor at Chicago Steven Collins conducted research in Buddhist Studies and South Asian Studies working with great originality at the intersection of historical sociology philosophy and the study of Buddhist literature in Pali. In her research Anne Blackburn works at the intersection of Buddhist institutional history political economy intellectual history and literature. She focuses on intellectual-political centers in what is now Sri Lanka (formerly Lanka) during the 2nd millennium A.D. and networked nodes across the Indian Ocean in what are now Burma and Thailand

The Jun Zhou Lecture Series supported through a generous gift by Mr. Jun Zhou allows the Divinity School to offer a series of lectures on topics in Theravada Buddhism.
