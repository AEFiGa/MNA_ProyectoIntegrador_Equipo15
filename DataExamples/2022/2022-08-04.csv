The fourth annual 3M Open – Minnesota’s one and only PGA TOUR event that recently took place at TPC Twin Cities in Blaine Minnesota – is about more than golf for 3M. It’s also a way for the company to give back build stronger communities and highlight how its science helps improve lives.

Each year 3M collaborates with customers partners and celebrities to celebrate the 3M Open by implementing special projects that use 3M’s science and innovation in unique ways to benefit local non-profit organizations.

Here is a recap of a few “surprise and delight” moments from this year’s tournament:

M Health Fairview Masonic Children’s Hospital Music Therapy program

After supporting the M Health Fairview Masonic Children’s Hospital art therapy program in 2021 3M turned its focus to the hospital’s music therapy program this year.

A federal study found young people have reported a significant increase in depression and anxiety over the past two years. The hospital’s music therapy program uses music as medicine to meet patients’ cognitive emotional spiritual physical and existential needs. Board certified musical therapists lead the program that serves outpatient day program children ages 6-18.

3M commercial graphics partner The Vomela Companies updated hospital therapy rooms with calming wall graphics using 3M Print Film and lighting improvements. New musical instruments sensory tools and headphones for the program were sourced through multiple 3M Open pre-tournament drives.

“The updated music therapy rooms are now inviting calming spaces that will inspire patients to express themselves through music to support their mental health. Like our music rooms our instruments were outdated too – some were about 40 years old. The quality of the new instruments will provide an improved experience” said Gene Nisja M.A. LMFT who manages the hospital’s day programs. “We really appreciate 3M for supporting children struggling with mental health and for believing in music as medicine.”

On July 20 Jeff Lavers group president of 3M Consumer Business and interim group president of 3M Health Care visited the hospital to deliver the donation drive items and check out the new décor along with Vomela COO Tim Wieland and a few celebrity guests – country music star Jake Owen Tampa Bay Buccaneers tight end Kyle Rudolph (a beloved former Minnesota Viking and generous supporter of the hospital) and Mardy Fish a former tennis pro and skilled golfer who played in the 3M Open as a sponsor exemption.

In turn they were treated to an inspired musical performance by a former day program participant and handmade thank you cards from current program patients.

Jake delivered a live performance that was televised throughout the hospital from the Zucker Family Suite and Broadcast Studio for all patients and staff to enjoy.

Prior to leaving the hospital and heading to TPC to participate in the 3M Open Pro-Am and Compass Challenge Jake Mardy and Kyle spoke to news media about the therapeutic value of music in their lives and the importance of mental health care.

“The kids really appreciated the visit from Jake Owen Kyle Rudolph and Mardy Fish. They were inspired to hear how music impacts and motivates them and learn how even famous singers like Jake Owen struggle with self-confidence. The visit brought smiles to their faces and I’m sure will be a moment they’ll never forget” said Nisja.

Urban Ventures receives donation of 25 iPads at 3M Open’s inaugural Golf 4 All Day

On July 19 Larry Fitzgerald a Minnesota native and former Arizona Cardinal regarded as one of the National Football League’s greatest wide receivers joined Kady Stoll 3M vice president of global sponsorships and Mike Welch 3M Open tournament director to announce a technology donation to Urban Ventures a Minneapolis-based nonprofit that serves over 1800 youth and families offering 'cradle-to-career' support that helps students graduate high school prepared for college or postsecondary education.

Insight Direct USA a longtime 3M technology supplier donated 25 iPads which 3M equipped with screen protectors. The donation will help Urban Ventures provide technology access for children in its program.

The Urban Ventures group also enjoyed some golf fun at 3M Open’s first-ever Golf 4 All Day. More than 500 kids from youth organizations around the Twin Cities had an opportunity to experience golf in unique ways including golf instruction from famous professional athletes as well as art science music and fashion activities at TPC.

“Urban Ventures is grateful to the 3M Open and The Larry Fitzgerald Foundation for making this special day for our youth possible. Larry embodies the character and leadership our youth aspire to. The gifted iPads will further advance learning within our Innovation Center where kids can explore computer coding robotics and other STEAM-related activities” said Urban Ventures President and CEO Dave Hawn.

Post-event in-kind donations

Two 3M Hydration Station units sponsored by 3M’s Separation and Purification Sciences Division and Elkay to provide complimentary refillable water bottles and filtered drinking water for fans at the 3M Open were donated to Stepping Stone a non-profit organization that provides shelter unique programming and support to adults experiencing homelessness. The contactless water bottle filling stations are the same design as units found in many airports schools offices and gyms.

“Generous donations like this help us by removing the burden of having to purchase expensive equipment. This specific donation has an even more valuable impact on our residents by providing them with peace of mind during an unimaginably stressful time and addressing their basic needs of convenient access to better tasting cleaner drinking water which they wouldn’t otherwise have” said Stepping Stone Executive Director Julie Jeppson.

The Symphonic Swing percussive art installation that entertained many 3M Open event goers near the fan entrance at TPC Twin Cities will also be donated to a non-profit organization to be determined later. The interactive walk-through display is made of 52 golf irons attached to chimes tuned to the natural keys of a piano. The fixture is assembled with 3M™ Scotch-Weld™ Epoxy Adhesive DP420 and it uses 3M™ Sound Damping Foils on the club heads to improve the tone of the ring and lower the volume.

3M Open pillar charities

The 3M Open will donate at least $1.5 million to charities this year with a cumulative total of more than $6 million donated since the event’s inception in 2019. The 2022 tournament supports the following pillar charities by raising awareness and contributing funds once the event is completed: M Health Fairview Masonic Children’s Hospital First Tee Minnesota YWCA of St. Paul YWCA of Minneapolis Greater Twin Cities United Way and Science Museum of Minnesota.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBybmV3c3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvM20tY29tbWVuY2VzLXNwbGl0LW9mZi1leGNoYW5nZS1vZmZlci1mb3ItZm9vZC1zYWZldHktYnVzaW5lc3MtMzAxNjAwMjI2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3M Commences Split-Off Exchange Offer for Food Safety Business,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBybmV3c3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvM20tY29tbWVuY2VzLXNwbGl0LW9mZi1leGNoYW5nZS1vZmZlci1mb3ItZm9vZC1zYWZldHktYnVzaW5lc3MtMzAxNjAwMjI2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D84B79390>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBybmV3c3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvM20tY29tbWVuY2VzLXNwbGl0LW9mZi1leGNoYW5nZS1vZmZlci1mb3ItZm9vZC1zYWZldHktYnVzaW5lc3MtMzAxNjAwMjI2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc3NkZXZpY2UuY29tLzNtLXdvdW5kLWNhcmUtdXBncmFkZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3M announces upgrades to wound therapy tech,"The 3M (NYSE:MMM) Health Care’s medical solutions business announced upgrades to advance the delivery of certain wound care technologies.

A new 3M Veraflo Cleans Choice Complete dressing kit and a software upgrade for the 3M VAC Ulta therapy unit were introduced at no increased cost to the customer.

3M said in a news release that the new offerings help to simplify the care delivery processes for clinicians using Veraflo negative pressure wound therapy with installation and help to make dressing changes easier faster and less painful for patients when compared to previous Veraflo therapy dressings.

Veraflo therapy is used for patients with open soft issue wounds to help cleanse and stimulate the formation of granulation tissue. The company pointed to a recent publication — titled Effects of Negative-Pressure Wound Therapy with Instillation versus Standard of Care in Multiple Wound Types: Systematic Literature Review and Meta-Analysis — that demonstrates significant clinical advantages and economic savings with Veraflo against other advanced wound therapies including traditional negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT).

Used in conjunction with Veraflo therapy the Veraflo Cleanse Choice Complete dressing kit helps to disrupt soften solubilize and remove thick exudate and non-viable tissue when immediate wound cleansing is needed or when surgical debridement must be delayed or is not possible.

“3M offers a broad range of wound care solutions because clinicians need a robust tool selection” Dr. Ronald Silverman M.D. 3M Health Care senior vice president of clinical affairs and CMO said in the release. “We continue to find ways to innovate to meet their unique wound care needs and address the changing nature of wound care. Today’s wound care patients are often sicker and have more comorbidities making their wounds more complex to treat and increasing the demands on clinicians’ time.

“We strive to make our products easier to use to help save clinicians’ valuable time and ultimately transform patient outcomes and improve their lives.”

The new software upgrade — which includes the 3M Smart Instill feature for use with Veraflo therapy — automates therapy initiation to make that process easier. It also features animated video troubleshooting an instill phase postpone feature a therapy inactive alarm time delay and updated default therapy settings. The updated settings were implemented based on the recommendations of a global panel of wound care leaders 3M said.

Software upgrades have been completed in all U.S. rental units and will begin to be implemented in owned units in the third quarter of this year.

3M developed the new dressing kit to simplify dressing application. It is a single piece rather than the current three-piece dressing. The change was made based on clinician feedback.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vaXRlcC5vcmcvY29ycG9yYXRlLW1pbmltdW0tdGF4LWV4YW1wbGVzLWFwcGxlLXdvdWxkLWxpa2VseS1wYXktbW9yZS0zbS13b3VsZC1ub3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Corporate Minimum Tax Examples: Apple Would Likely Pay More 3M Would Not,"August 5 2022 Matthew Gardner

Senior Fellow

August 5 2022

Note: This analysis does not incorporate the recent change that Senate Democrats have made to the minimum corporate tax provision to prevent it from limiting depreciation breaks. It is reported that this will have a small effect on the overall impact of the provision.

Apple one of the largest corporations in the United States despite manufacturing most of its physical products offshore would likely pay the corporate minimum tax that is included in the Inflation Reduction Act that the Senate is debating this week. 3M a manufacturer that has about 40 percent of its workforce in the United States likely would not pay the corporate minimum tax if current trends in the company’s profits and taxes continue because it is already paying above 15 percent of its profits in taxes.

These figures are based on the profits and tax payments that both companies report in the 10-K that they submit to the Securities and Exchange Commission and make public. And they illustrate how two corporations characterized as manufacturers could be affected by the proposal.

The federal corporate income tax applies at a rate of 21 percent but many companies effectively pay far less than that because of the special breaks and loopholes that litter the tax code and many pay no income tax in some years. The IRA’s corporate minimum tax is meant to address this problem.

It would apply to companies with more than $1 billion in average global profits over three years. If such a company pays less than 15 percent of its global profits in income taxes (including both U.S. federal income taxes under the regular tax rules and foreign income taxes paid on offshore profits) then it would pay the difference under the proposed provision to bring its global effective tax rate up to 15 percent.

As illustrated in Table 1 below Apple has reported global effective tax rates of less than 15 percent in two of the previous four years.[1] 3M on the other hand has reported global effective tax rates of 19 to 21 percent during these years. If the corporate minimum tax had been in effect during this period it therefore seems likely that it would have affected Apple but not 3M.[2]

It is impossible to know this with certainty because the 10-K does not include all the information one would need to calculate the precise effects of the provision. And the companies’ tax positions could change over time meaning it is difficult to use this information to predict which corporations would or would not be affected by the provision in the future.

Republicans Cite the Provision’s Likely Effect on Manufacturing but “Manufacturing” Can Mean Different Things

Last week Sen. Mike Crapo the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee released a statement arguing that the provision would “overwhelmingly hit American manufacturers and supply chains.”

As ITEP has explained elsewhere Sen. Crapo’s statement relies on an incomplete analysis from Congress’s official revenue estimators at the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT). It shows that of the $313 billion that would be raised over a decade by the corporate minimum tax about half that amount ($156 billion) would be paid by corporations that describe themselves as mainly manufacturers. Crapo does not mention that the bill would spend $369 billion on energy and climate provisions that would increase manufacturing of electric cars batteries solar panels and other products in the United States.

The principle of the minimum tax – that all successful corporations should pay a reasonable amount of taxes to help finance the public investments that make their success possible – would logically seem to apply to all companies regardless of sector.

Further the JCT report cited by Crapo relies on a broad definition of “manufacturing” that corporations designate for themselves and which includes companies like Apple that do not physically produce much of anything here in the United States. Apple’s physical products are made by suppliers it contracts with including 338 suppliers in Asia (156 in China alone) and only 25 suppliers that are located primarily in the United States.

In fact companies like Apple are precisely why the corporate minimum tax is needed. A 2013 Senate hearing exposed the convoluted accounting gimmicks the company used to claim profits were generated by subsidiaries in Ireland that were for tax purposes not resident of any country and thus not taxed. When under international pressure the Irish government began to crack down Apple shifted its strategy to another tax haven the tiny island of Jersey. This was revealed in the “Paradise Papers” a trove of documents from the Bermuda-based law firm that helped Apple pull off this feat.

3M could not be more different from Apple. Most Americans probably know 3M as a manufacturer of tape sandpaper and medical supplies including masks worn to avoid Covid. 3M is a huge conglomerate but with profits ranging from $5 billion to $7 billion in recent years it seems small compared to Apple with its recent global profits exceeding $100 billion. As of 2020 3M reported that it had 96000 employees and that 39000 of those around 40 percent of the total were in the United States.

There has been little if any attention paid by the media to 3M’s tax strategies. This is not to say that the company eschews tax avoidance for any altruistic or ethical reason. But the simple fact is that its global effective tax rate each year has been a bit higher than Apple’s and high enough to avoid paying under the IRA’s corporate minimum tax.

Table 2 below provides a more detailed version of the information in Table 1 above about the two companies’ profits and taxes.

[1] The federal income tax shown here for the companies does not include a transition tax they both paid in 2018 ($37.3 billion in the case of Apple $97 million in the case of 3M) under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on offshore profits that they had reported in earlier years.

[2] The federal tax shown here is the “current” tax that the companies report for the tax year which is their best estimate of what they will ultimately pay for the tax year. This is the most useful number reported in the 10-K to understand what companies pay for specific tax years. It does not include deferred taxes which are taxes that companies expect and plan to pay in the future. The U.S. profits are taken from the 10-K and state income taxes are subtracted.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL25ld3MuM20uY29tLzIwMjItMDgtMDQtM00tdXBncmFkZXMtbWFrZS1uZWdhdGl2ZS1wcmVzc3VyZS13b3VuZC10aGVyYXB5LXdpdGgtaW5zdGlsbGF0aW9uLWVhc2llci1mb3ItY2xpbmljaWFucy10by1pbml0aWF0ZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3M upgrades make negative pressure wound therapy with instillation easier for clinicians to initiate,"3M upgrades make negative pressure wound therapy with instillation easier for clinicians to initiate

ST. PAUL Minn. Aug. 4 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- 3M Health Care's Medical Solutions Division has advanced the delivery of 3M™ Veraflo™ Therapy. A new 3M™ Veraflo™ Cleanse Choice Complete™ Dressing Kit and a software upgrade for the 3M™ V.A.C.® Ulta Therapy Unit was introduced at no increase cost to the customer. These new offerings help simplify the care delivery processes for clinicians using Veraflo Therapy (negative pressure wound therapy with instillation) and help make dressing changes easier faster and less painful for their patients as compared to previous Veraflo Therapy dressings.

Wound care experts use Veraflo Therapy for patients with open soft tissue wounds to help cleanse and stimulate formation of granulation tissue. A recent publication by Gabriel et al Effects of Negative-Pressure Wound Therapy with Instillation versus Standard of Care in Multiple Wound Types: Systematic Literature Review and Meta-Analysis shows that Veraflo Therapy demonstrated significant clinical advantages and economic savings versus other advanced wound therapies including traditional negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT). When Veraflo Cleanse Choice Complete Dressing is used in conjunction with Veraflo Therapy the combination helps to disrupt soften solubilize and remove thick exudate and non-viable tissue when immediate wound cleansing is needed or when surgical debridement must be delayed or is not possible.

""3M offers a broad range of wound care solutions because clinicians need a robust tool selection"" said Ronald Silverman M.D. 3M Health Care senior vice president of clinical affairs and chief medical officer.

Software upgrade

The V.A.C.® Ulta Therapy Unit is the only negative wound pressure therapy device that delivers four therapy options enabling clinicians in the acute care setting to manage open abdomens closed incisions and open soft tissue wounds across a wide range of complexities including size contamination and etiology.

The device's newly upgraded software which includes the 3M™ Smart Instill™ Feature for use with Veraflo Therapy automates therapy initiation and makes it easier for clinicians to initiate therapy. Additional upgraded functionalities include animated video troubleshooting an instill phase postpone feature a therapy inactive alarm time delay providing clinicians a choice to delay alarms during dressing changes along with the updated default therapy settings. These new default settings are based on the recommendations of a global panel of wound care leaders as outlined in a 2020 NPWT with instillation consensus guidelines update document published in International Wound Journal. Kim PJ Attinger CE Constantine T et al. Int Wound J.2020;17:174–186.

""Veraflo Therapy with Smart Instill Feature helps remove the guesswork and difficult aspects of setting up NPWT with instillation for patients. You push a button or two and the software guides you through the decision-making process significantly decreasing the time involved in administering the therapy"" said Marc Matthews MD MS MCG FACS Arizona Burn Center associate director.

The software upgrade has been completed in all US rental units. Owned units will be upgraded beginning in 3Q22.

Dressing kit

Based on clinician feedback the new Veraflo Choice Cleanse Complete Dressing Kit was developed to simplify dressing application and reduce the number of SKUs and ancillary products used to manage open soft tissue wounds. The kit's new dressing is a single piece which users may find easier to apply than the current three-piece dressing. The three-piece dressing is still an available option for users who are accustomed to this design. This kit is also the first time the 3M™ Dermatac™ Drape is included in a Veraflo Therapy Dressing Kit. Dermatac Drape is constructed of a unique silicone-acrylic hybrid material that is gentler than acrylic drapes on patients' skin at removal leading to less painful dressing changes. During application the drape can also be repositioned which simplifies clinicians' efforts.

The combination of the Smart Instill Feature and the Veraflo Cleanse Choice Complete Dressing Kit make Veraflo Therapy easier than ever to apply. Now clinicians can choose a more innovative therapy option without the challenge of increased complexities or costs while positively impacting the patient's experience.

Smith did not need to repeat itself to make the point clear in this short and to-the-point specification.” – CAFC

On August 3 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) issued a decision in A. O. Smith Corp. v. Bradford White Corp. which affirmed rulings from the District of Delaware that A. O. Smith’s patent covering a hot-water heater system was both infringed by Bradford White and not invalid. The appellate court ruled that the district court’s construction of a contested limitation within claim 1 was supported by the patent’s specification. Judge Timothy Dyk concurred with the majority’s ruling but argued that the majority should have based its decision to affirm claim construction on evidentiary findings made by the district court.

Delaware Bench Trial Results in Infringement No Invalidity Rulings

The patent-at-issue in this appeal is U.S. Patent No. 8375897 Gas Water Heater. Claim 1 the only claim of the ‘897 patent recites:

“1. A method of interfacing a natural convection vent construction with a water heater the method comprising:

providing a water heater having a burner a blower and a flue;

creating products of combustion with the burner;

forcing the products of combustion into the flue under positive pressure with the blower;

interposing an exhaust plenum between the flue and the natural convection vent construction;

dropping the pressure of the products of combustion to near atmospheric pressure within the plenum;

and permitting the products of combustion to rise out of the plenum and into the natural convection vent construction substantially entirely under the influence of natural convection;

wherein the natural convection vent construction includes a draft hood the method further comprising mixing ambient air with the products of combustion as the products of combustion flow into the draft hood.”

A.O. Smith filed suit in March 2018 alleging that Bradford White’s water heaters infringed upon the ‘897 patent. In an early claim construction hearing the Delaware district court dismissed Bradford White’s argument that the permitting limitation specifically the language “substantially entirely under the influence of natural convection” was indefinite “because a relevant artisan would not understand the degree of influence that the power burner and other factors exert on the products as they enter the vent.” Rather the district court found that the ‘897 patent’s specification which included a reference to Category I venting as embodied in the National Fuel Gas Code favored plaintiff A. O. Smith’s construction “[a]t a pressure near or below atmospheric pressure and without the influence of the power burner such that a Category I venting system can be used.” Similarly the district court also construed “natural convection” from the permitting limitation to mean “fluid motion compatible with use of a Category I venting system.”

Following a bench trial the Delaware district court ruled that expert testimony presented at trial established that Bradford White had directly and indirectly infringed claim 1 of the ‘897 patent as construed by the district court. The district court also dismissed Bradford White’s invalidity contentions after the bench trial. Following the adverse ruling Bradford White appealed the district court’s construction of the term “natural convection” as well as arguments that the dropping limitation of claim 1 was anticipated by U.S. Patent No. 5228413 Multiple Boiler (“Tam”).

Under Phillips Category I Requirement in Specification Support Claim Construction

In reviewing the district court’s construction of the claim term “natural convection” for clear error the Federal Circuit opinion authored by Judge Richard Taranto dismissed Bradford White’s arguments that the term must be read in isolation in order to determine its ordinary meaning from dictionary definitions. The Federal Circuit noted that under Phillips v. AWH Corp. (2005) courts are to take into account the context of words surrounding the challenged claim term as well as the patent’s specification. Because “natural convection” was part of a larger claim construction already determined by the district court that was unchallenged by Bradford White the essential context for the claim term “invites clarification from the specification” as was already determined by the district court. The ‘897 patent’s specification discloses the relationship between natural convection and atmospheric venting as well as the retrofitting capabilities of the water heater. The CAFC explained:

“A.O. Smith did not need to repeat itself to make the point clear in this short and to-the-point specification: A requirement of the claimed invention was compatibility with the installed base of Category I venting systems into which the water heater operating according to the invented method could be ‘retrofitted.’”

The Federal Circuit also rejected Bradford White’s argument that the inclusion of the Category I requirement in claim construction was harmful error requiring a new trial. Bradford White had contended that the district court’s conclusions on the permitting limitation of the ‘897 patent rendered immaterial the specification’s discussion of the “velocity” or “flow” of the heater’s combustion products. The Federal Circuit found however that the district court relied upon evidentiary findings including industry standards and expert testimony that reasonably assigned little weight to velocity and instead found that the negative pressure of combustion products leaving the plenum along with the Category I certification of those products proved that the permitting limitation was satisfied. The CAFC also agreed with the district court’s reasoning for not crediting Bradford White’s velocity argument given expert testimony that skilled artisans would recognize that velocity could be a product of natural convection in conjunction with variables other than the water heater’s blower.

Pressure Dropping Limitation Not Anticipated by Tam

Moving on to Bradford White’s contention that the ‘897 patent was anticipated by Tam the Federal Circuit also agreed with the district court that Tam did not disclose the dropping limitation of the ‘897 patent. The district court construed the dropping limitation as requiring the pressure of combustion products to be positive prior to entering the plenum which again was supported by the claim term’s ordinary meaning within the context of the patent’s specification as well as expert testimony regarding the skilled artisan’s interpretation of the term. Although Bradford White argued that this construction read out the “creep and spill” embodiment described in the ‘897 patent’s specification the Federal Circuit found the claim language to be clear enough that the district court’s construction was proper even if it didn’t cover an embodiment outlined in the specification. Although Bradford White presented expert testimony at the district court contradicting this finding the appellate court noted that its proffered expert did not qualify as a skilled artisan as of the ‘897 patent’s priority date and that the expert’s testimony did not justify any departure from the district court’s claim construction.

Judge Dyk: Panel Majority Incorrect to Base Ruling on Post-Trial Claim Construction

Although Circuit Judge Dyk joined the majority’s reasoning with regards to the invalidity arguments surrounding Tam he wrote separately in a concurrence to argue that he would have affirmed the district court’s infringement findings through a path other than claim construction. While Category I compliance was necessary for satisfying the permitting step following claim construction “[a]fter trial the district court appeared to hold for the first time that satisfying the Category I compliance standard itself established infringement of the permitting limitation” Judge Dyk wrote.

While the panel majority approved of the post-trial Category I construction Judge Dyk found that the ‘897 patent’s claim language including the dropping limitation requiring negative pressure along with its specification did not establish that Category I compliance itself sufficiently proved the permitting limitation. Instead Judge Dyk would have rested his infringement ruling on the district court’s evidentiary findings including expert testimony which led the district court to conclude that there was no significant influence from the power burner at the point of the permitting limitation. While Judge Dyk acknowledged that this factual determination created an open question as the ‘897 patent “appears to assume that negative pressure does not preclude influence of the power burner” that factual finding was not challenged by Bradford White on appeal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5qc29ubGluZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9zb2x1dGlvbnMvMjAyMi8wOC8wNS9taWx3YXVrZWVzLWhpc3RvcmljYWwtYnJvbnpldmlsbGUtbGl2ZXMtbmV3LXdlYnNpdGUtYW5kLWFwcC8xMDI0MTc4MDAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Milwaukee's historical Bronzeville lives on at a new website and app dedicated to preserving its stories,"It dawned on Patricia Diggs one day as she chatted with her ailing father: Who would preserve his story his history once he was gone? That nagging question led to another. Who would preserve the stories of other Black elders in Milwaukee?

“We were chatting about the good old days at Allis Chalmers and A.O. Smith (major employers during Milwaukee’s manufacturing heyday) and I stood there and asked myself ‘Who is going to write their stories?’ ”

That was 2003 and those questions have been gnawing at her heart ever since. It led her to help publish a 2006 book by Ivory Abena Black on Bronzeville and to a collaboration with Milwaukee PBS on the 2008 documentary “Punching In” which examined how the loss of manufacturing jobs hurt the city’s middle class.

Telling the stories of Milwaukee’s African American families and businesses in a new way is the goal of a project just launched by Diggs and Kitonga Alexander a doctoral student at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. “Milwaukee Bronzeville Histories” is a website and mobile app that will allow people to learn about the past — and the present — as they walk the northside neighborhood. It went live in time for Bronzeville Week which begins Saturday.

Our Wisconsin Weavers Project is an idea borrowed from The Aspen Institute a global nonprofit headquartered in Washington D.C. Aspen started Weave: The Social Fabric Project in 2018 to help solve the problem of broken social trust that has left many Americans divided. Aspen works to find weavers tell their stories and offer them support and connection.

From Malcolm X to Larry Hill a wealth of stories

Both Diggs and Alexander have strong ties to the city. Diggs was born and raised in Milwaukee before leaving to work for years in public relations in Washington D.C. and now in Los Angeles where she owns her own creative agency. Alexander also a Milwaukee native was a schoolteacher in the city for 12 years and also has worked in human services. His doctoral focus at UWM is Black Milwaukee history since the 1940s.

The website and app they’ve created tell the stories of famous people who once lived in or near Bronzeville — the martyred civil right leader Malcom X (who lived there a couple years as a young boy) the actor and singer Paul Robeson (he played for the Milwaukee Badgers an early NFL football team) and the actress Hattie McDaniel (the first Black actor to win an Academy Award for her performance in “Gone with the Wind” she said Milwaukee had been her ""springboard"" to Hollywood).

But they also tell more prosaic stories — about people like Larry Hill who for years ran Larry’s Lunch-ette at 619 W. Walnut St. or Mattiebelle Woods a prolific journalist who spent decades chronicling the social life of Milwaukee’s Black community. When she died at 102 years of age in 2005 she was believed to be the nation’s oldest working journalist. Or Cleveland Colbert a musician upholsterer crane operator and aviator who flew (against his will) during the Spanish Civil War. He was an early advocate for the idea that African Americans should own their own factories to provide jobs for the community. He was active in local politics and wrote a book in 1951 detailing his ideas.

The mission in telling their stories? To knit the past cleanly with the present and show why Bronzeville mattered — and matters still.

Bronzeville lost and regained

Historic Bronzeville was bordered by North Avenue on the north State Street on the south Third Street on the east and 12th Street on the west. But Walnut Street was its economic heart. In an era of ironclad segregation Milwaukee’s Bronzeville grew into a vibrant and self-sufficient business and cultural community renowned for its nightlife and entertainment. Some of America’s top Black talent including Duke Ellington Billie Holiday and Louis Armstrong played the clubs there.

After World War II though urban renewal and later the construction of I-43 led to the destruction of hundreds of homes and severely disrupted the community. In recent years Bronzeville is seeing a rebirth along Martin Luther King Jr. Drive and North Avenue with millions of dollars of redevelopment including the new home for America’s Black Holocaust Museum Pete’s Fruit Market the Bronzeville Center for the Arts and the relocation of the Greater Milwaukee Foundation’s offices. The foundation is helping to fund the Bronzeville Histories website and app.

The app creates a self-guided walking tour of Bronzeville offering stories and maps that pop up to show where people lived or worked. There are two tours: one of historical Bronzeville and the other of sites in the ""new"" Bronzeville including the arts center and museum.

“I like to say that these were people that made a way out of no way” Alexander said. “These were people who were transitioning a community from surviving to thriving. And that’s what we recognize about them.”

Alexander says the spirit of people like Larry Hill a World War II veteran who was awarded the Purple Heart lives on in the new ventures around the community. “Throughout the community we see sprinkles of that spirit — one example is Sherman Phoenix” he said an entrepreneurial hub at 36th St. and Fond du Lac Ave. that arose as a response to unrest in that area in 2016.

“Efforts like that are we argue the rekindled spirit of Bronzeville.”

Diggs says the goal is two-fold: create a digital library for both scholars and the community “especially young people.”

“We see this as an opportunity for all Milwaukeeans to be able to learn not just about the old Bronzeville but also about the new Milwaukee” Diggs said. “And so that’s something that we’re looking forward to to really weave those threads of understanding and community which we all need right now.”

Alexander and Diggs hope this is just the beginning. They realize there are hundreds more stories like the ones they’ve collected so far. They would like to add to their collection.

As Alexander notes “There is some great information just sitting in somebody’s attic right now.”

A third high-speed aseptic filling line will be installed in the project.

The port authority needed the city’s approval to pursue a project outside of Montgomery County and in Tipp City according to a council-approved resolution.

The port authority involvement in the expansion will include use of its tax-exempt status. The port authority will enter into a lease agreement with Abbott that will allow the company to buy building materials without sales tax.

The city referred project questions to the Dayton Development Coalition which in turn referred inquiries to Abbott’s communications department.

Friday afternoon Abbott officials released a brief statement.

“Abbott is expanding its Tipp City nutrition facility with a new liquid manufacturing line and upgrades to meet the growing global demand for our adult nutrition products including Ensure Glucerna and Pedialyte” said Brandi Martin director of public affairs for Abbott. “We began planning for this expansion more than a year ago and appreciate the support from Tipp City and the state of Ohio.”

Abbott Laboratories filed with the city a request for tax abatement stating the company’s current 317 jobs would be joined by another 123 during the next five years.

The city notified the Tipp City Board of Education about the project plans and the request for 100 percent abatement of taxes for 15 years. The request was filed under the city Community Reinvestment Areas provisions for CRAs created before 1994.

Those provisions did not require board of education approval of the abatement. Changes in the law since 1994 require board approval of a 100 percent abatement.

The schools will benefit from added income tax because the project is to create new employee payroll of more than $1 million City Manager Tim Eggleston wrote in the notice to the schools.

Under state law the city would provide the schools 50 percent of income tax receipts for all new employees during the 15-year incentive timeframe.

The proposed site plan for the expansion project will be before the Tipp City Planning Board next week.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3BvbGl0aWNzLzIwMjIvMDgvMDQvYWJib3R0LXRvdXRzLXRleGFzLXRhdW50cy1jYWxpZm9ybmlhLWFzLWNwYWMtY29uc2VydmF0aXZlLWdhdGhlcmluZy1raWNrcy1vZmYtaW4tZGFsbGFzL9IBmwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3BvbGl0aWNzLzIwMjIvMDgvMDQvYWJib3R0LXRvdXRzLXRleGFzLXRhdW50cy1jYWxpZm9ybmlhLWFzLWNwYWMtY29uc2VydmF0aXZlLWdhdGhlcmluZy1raWNrcy1vZmYtaW4tZGFsbGFzLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Abbott touts Texas as CPAC kicks off in Dallas,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott took aim at Democratic leaders in Texas and across the country in his appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference gathering Thursday in Dallas.

The governor boasted about the state’s business-friendly policies bringing in companies from California and the busloads of newly arrived migrants the state has sent to Washington.

American Conservative Union chairman Matt Schlapp and his wife and CPAC senior fellow Mercedes Schlapp interviewed Abbott about his record on business immigration and education in front of an enthusiastic crowd.

Abbott and the Schlapps took jabs at California and the state’s governor Gavin Newsom who has jousted regularly with Texas Republicans. The California Democrat most recently ran ads in Texas newspapers criticizing Abbott and other Texas Republicans’ policies on abortion and gun control.

Abbott shot back at Newsom on stage.

“He’s just pissed off that all of his businesses are moving to Texas” Abbott said of Newsom.

Immigration and border security were a major talking point for Abbott on stage. He called for Republicans to impeach Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas if the party takes control of the House after the midterm elections.

Abbott also criticized Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser who asked the White House for assistance from the National Guard in managing the thousands of migrants who have arrived on buses sent by Texas and Arizona.

Abbott said the state has transported over 6500 migrants from the border to Washington.

“They cannot handle that one single challenge. We deal with that number every single day” Abbott said. “I have one thing to say to you and to them: There are more buses on the way as we gather at this convention.”

Abbott missed the last CPAC in Dallas. Several other Texas conservatives are set to speak during the conference including Sen. Ted Cruz Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and Attorney General Ken Paxton.

The governor also attacked Democratic rival Beto O’Rourke over school choice and parental involvement in education. The mention of O’Rourke’s name drew raucous boos from the audience.

“You love your children more than any government employee ever can” Abbott said. “You have the right to be the decision maker for health care and educational decisions for your child. You should have the right to choose the school that is best for your child rather than the government mandating what school your child should attend.”

O’Rourke has pushed back against Republican proposals for school choice vouchers.

Abbott could be facing a tighter race than in years past as he seeks his third term as governor. A poll from the University of Houston conducted in late June and early July found Abbott polling five percentage points ahead of O’Rourke.

Though the governor potentially faces a closer race than in previous years Republicans are favored to win back the majority in Congress in the Nov. 8 midterm elections.

Abbott asserted the party’s electoral strength especially among Hispanic voters. He touted Rep. Mayra Flores’ special election win that flipped the majority-Latino 34th district red as an indicator the party will keep winning votes from Latinos.

“For the Hispanic community the core is faith in God putting family first and respecting the freedom that exists in no place better than the United States of America” Abbott said. “That’s what Mayra Flores campaigned on that’s what conservatives believe in and that’s one reason why we are winning Hispanics.”

The decision leaves competitors who want to offer biosimilar drugs—cheaper versions of complex treatments made from living cells— or others hoping for easier access with lengthier and more expensive options. They can either challenge the validity of individual patents or try to prove invalid patents have been asserted in bad faith.

Eli Lilly had some of the most disappointing sales figures in Q2 for its migraine prevention drug Emgality FDA-approved four years ago which saw sales hit $157.5 million an increase of just 1% compared to the year-ago period.

The drop was from the U.S. where sales were just $108.6 million down 3% on 2021’s numbers. This was driven by “lower realized prices” due to higher contracted rebates and an “unfavorable segment mix” Lilly said in its financial statement.

But there was some good news. The decline was “largely offset by increased demand” Lilly found when combing through the numbers and revenue outside the U.S. was $48.9 million up 11%.

Lilly’s other migraine treatment Reyvow was absent from its “select products” list in its Q2 review. Since its 2019 approval the drug has suffered from weak sales amid side effects concerns.

In the first quarter of the year all eyes were on the emerging battle between AbbVie and Biohaven a David and Goliath match-up of two new companies trying to dominate a highly competitive market.

In Q1 both were hit by weak sales. AbbVie’s oral CGRP inhibitor Ubrelvy approved to treat migraine in late 2019 brought $138 million sales in the first quarter which missed Wall Street’s expectations by 18% and marked a 25% decline from the fourth quarter of 2021.

And AbbVie's newly launched Qulipta green lit in September 2021 to prevent migraine generated $11 million in its market debut but analysts had anticipated $20 million.

When AbbVie posted its numbers Biohaven’s stock price dropped because the pharma’s numbers suggested the entire class is facing pricing pressure.

In the end Biohaven reeled in $123.6 million for its migraine treatment and prevention drug Nurtec a major 35% decrease from Q4 which the company said was “largely driven by seasonality related to renewed patient deductibles and prescription reauthorization.”

That news was mostly forgotten in the noise of a buyout from partner Pfizer which snapped up the company predominately for Nurtec. The migraine med was first approved in early 2020.

The second quarter was far kinder to its numbers: Nurtec saw $194 million in sales a 109% increase over the second quarter of 2021 and a 57% increase from Q1.

Biohaven said in its financials that this was “due primarily to increased Nurtec prescription sales volume” and “favorable pack mix per prescription.”

AbbVie meanwhile posted sales of $185 million for Ubrelvy up 48% on last year while Qulipta ticked up to make $33 million.

AbbVie will now have to battle against the marketing might of Pfizer as it subsumes Biohaven into its business so expect this complex market to only heat up in the future but both have seemingly shrugged off the Q1 disappointment.

Amgen’s therapy Aimovig a migraine prevention drug that like Lilly’s Emgality has been on the market since 2018 also saw some good news with sales up 12% year-over-year for the second quarter bringing in $92 million. But sales here were primarily driven by higher net selling price but partially offset by an 11% decline in volume and still doing half of the sales Biohaven is bringing in.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9nbG9iYWwtdG5mLWFscGhhLWluaGliaXRvcnMtbWFya2V0LTExMDQwMDI0MS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Global TNF Alpha Inhibitors Market Report 2022-2026 & 2031 Featuring Major Players - AbbVie Amgen J&J UCB ...,"Company Logo

Global Tnf Alpha Inhibitors Market

These are important treatments in the number of inflammatory conditions including spondylarthritis psoriasis rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).



The main types of drugs in TNF alpha inhibitors are remicade (infliximab) enbrel (etanercept) humira (adalimumab) cimzia (certolizumab pegol) and simponi (golimumab). REMICADE is a prescription drug for persons with slightly to severely active Crohn's disease who haven't had success with other treatments. The different routes of administration include oral subcutaneous intravenous others and involves various types of diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease psoriatic arthritis ulcerative colitis (uc) rheumatoid arthritis ankylosing spondylitis others.



The growing prevalence of inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis is a key factor driving the growth of the TNF alpha inhibitors market. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) inhibitors are commonly used in gastroenterology dermatology and rheumatology for the treatment of various immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.

Globally the prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is about 0.5-24.5 cases for ulcerative colitis per 100000 person-years and 0.1-16 cases for Crohn's disease per 100000 person-years and overall IBD prevalence is 396 cases per 100000 people each year. Thus the increasing number of cases of inflammatory diseases increases the demand for TNF alpha inhibitors contributing to the growth of the market.



The adverse side effects of TNF alpha inhibitors on patients are expected to limit the growth of the TNF alpha inhibitors market. The multiple adverse effects of TNF alpha inhibition identified by clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance include injection site reactions neutropenia infusion reactions and infections.

Story continues

According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) TNA alpha inhibitors can cause serious infections in people with weaker immune systems or low resistance levels. The infections can be bacterial mycobacterial fungal and viral leading to various diseases such as tuberculosis histoplasmosis candidiasis blastomycosis and hepatitis B. These side effects force patients to prefer alternatives such as non-TNF biologics which hampers the growth of the market.



The countries covered in the TNF alpha inhibitors market report are Australia Brazil China France Germany India Indonesia Japan Russia South Korea UK and USA.

In July a cream formulation of ruxolitinib (Opzelura) a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor became the first repigmentation treatment approved by the FDA for nonsegmental vitiligo the most common form of the disease.

Topical ruxolitinib was first approved in September 2021 for atopic dermatitis and dermatologists are already writing prescriptions for its new vitiligo indication.

Dr Seemal Desai

""The FDA approval of ruxolitinib for repigmentation of vitiligo is historic and groundbreaking"" Seemal Desai MD a dermatologist with the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Dallas told Medscape Medical News.

The news brings hope to patients 12 years and older who suffer from the psychosocial effects of the disease which is estimated to affect 1.9 million to 2.8 million adults in the United States.

The announcement followed FDA approval a month earlier of another dermatologic milestone ― an oral JAK inhibitor baricitinib which became the first treatment for patients with alopecia areata.

For Desai the ruxolitinib news is personal. His brother also a physician has lived a lifetime with vitiligo. His family experience Desai said showed him ""what a disease like this can do to a person psychologically.""

Seemal Desai said his early exposure helped lead to his own decision to dedicate his career to pigmentary diseases.

His brother won't personally benefit from the cream because his skin has been completely depigmented and repigmentation is not of interest to him Desai said. But both brothers are excited as physicians. ""It's really quite an emotional moment"" he said.

Getting the News to Patients

As dermatologists introduce the topical treatment to patients common questions center on why this cream is different and whether it is safe.

Dr David Rosmarin

David Rosmarin MD vice chair of research and education Department of Dermatology Tufts Medical Center Boston led the Topical Ruxolitinib Evaluation in Vitiligo Study 1 and 2 (TruE-V1 TruE-V2) conducted in North America and Europe.

He summarized some key findings.

""If patients have involvement on the face trunk or extremities the data show that about half the patients at 52 weeks will get half or more of their pigment back"" he told Medscape Medical News.

Results for the face alone are even better. ""Half the patients will get 75% or more pigment back in the face"" Rosmarin said.

In addition analysis of subgroups shows benefit for all patients. ""Patients seem to respond similarly well across all subgroups ― across gender sex age ethnicity and race"" Rosmarin said.

However anatomic region matters he pointed out. Skin of the head and neck responds the best followed by skin of the trunk and extremities. The hands and feet are the most difficult to repigment because there are few hair follicles which help enable repigmentation.

He added that it's important to understand patients' goals and dermatologists shouldn't assume that all who have vitiligo will want to undergo repigmentation. They may be interested in the new treatment but may not want it for themselves he explained.

Explaining Risks

Patients may ask about the boxed warning on the label that lists risk of heart attack stroke cancer infections blood clots and death. Dermatologists can explain that that warning pertains to the whole JAK class and was based on patients with rheumatoid arthritis Rosmarin said.

He added ""We didn't see a signal for heart attack and stroke for patients using the topical. But it's still important to discuss the label as the FDA states it.""

There are two main side effects Rosmarin said: acne (about 6% of treated patients get it and it's usually mild) and application-site reactions. ""Luckily the medication has a tendency not to sting or burn which is not the case with some of our other treatments. It's very well tolerated"" he said.

Patients should also know that repigmentation can take time because initially the immune system is directed to calm down with treatment and then pigment must travel back to the affected sites.

Some patients may have a response in as early as 2–3 months and others need more time Rosmarin said.

Treatment responses among adolescents have been particularly good. Responses regarding the skin of the face have been similar to those of adults. ""However on the body they respond even better"" Rosmarin said. ""About 60% achieve 50% or more repigmentation on the whole body.""

It's important that ruxolitinib has been approved for persons aged 12 years and older he said because ""about half the patients will develop vitiligo by the age of 20.""

Approval and Insurance Coverage

FDA approval will help with reimbursement for the expensive treatment.

The label indicates that patients should not use more than one 60-g tube a week. Currently the out-of-pocket cost for one tube can be close to $2000 according to GoodRx.

Dr Raj Chovatiya

Raj Chovatiya MD PhD assistant professor of dermatology and director of the Center for Eczema and Itch at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago said that in recent years vitiligo patients aware that their condition could be treated by JAK inhibitors have been paying out of pocket at compounding pharmacies which take oral versions of the medication and compound them into topical formulations.

Unlike baricitinib which is used to treat severe alopecia areata and other oral JAK inhibitors testing for TB and hepatitis is not required for initiating treatment with ruxolitinib so no delay is necessary Chovatiya said.

He noted however that patients with vitiligo may have given up on effective care after experiencing little or no improvement with topical corticosteroids phototherapy or topical calcineurin inhibitors.

""They end up losing steam are less motivated on therapy and are lost to care"" he said.

Dermatologists he said may need to proactively find these patients and tell them the good news. ""Now that we have really good targeted therapeutic options it's really up to us to figure out how to bring these people back to the clinic and educate them"" Chovatiya said.

Unanswered Questions to Address

Some questions are still unanswered lead study author Rosmarin said.

Two big questions are how long people will need to continue using ruxolitinib cream and whether depigmentation will recur if people stop using it.

Another aspect of therapy being studied is whether the cream will be even more effective in combination with other treatments.

""The main combination we think about is ruxolitinib with phototherapy ― a light treatment ― because light could stimulate those pigment cells"" Rosmarin said

He noted that light therapy was included in phase 2 testing and that patients did respond. ""What we need and what's planned is a larger study looking at the combination to see whether it is synergistic or not. The longer patients use the cream the more benefit we see"" Rosmarin said.

Desai has served as an investigator and/or consultant to several companies including Incyte. Rosmarin received honoraria as a consultant for Incyte AbbVie Abcuro AltruBio Arena Boehringer Ingelheim Bristol Meyers Squibb Celgene Concert CSL Behring Dermavant Dermira Janssen Kyowa Kirin Lilly Novartis Pfizer Regeneron Revolo Biotherapeutics Sanofi Sun Pharmaceuticals UCB and VielaBio.

Channel partner giants like Accenture Capgemini Deloitte and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) are some of the biggest and best public cloud IT transformation providers across the globe according to a new report by Gartner.

However depending on the cloud transformation use case—such as modernizing legacy applications and the ability to share knowledge to customers during IT transformation—the worldwide market leaders vary.

IT research firm Gartner recently scored and ranked the top 20 cloud transformation service providers that includes some of the largest MSPs system integrators and channel partners with its new 2022 Critical Capabilities for Public Cloud IT Transformation Services report.

[Related: Aviatrix CEO On Potential Post-Broadcom VMware Layoffs]

Cloud Transformation Key Findings

One of the key findings in Gartner’s new report is that cloud transformation services offered by MSPs system integrators and cloud service providers are more readily available than ever.

This is a reaction to the significant 41 percent annual growth in infrastructure as-a-service (IaaS) and platform as-a-service (PaaS) cloud services in 2021.

Another finding from Gartner is that business outcome models are increasingly being sought by clients and can be now delivered by many providers. Shorter payment transactions time to market and increased customer engagement are just a few of the outcomes now being offered Gartner said.

Gartner’s Scoring System

Gartner ranks each company on a scoring basis from 1.0 to 5.0.

Companies are scored in several areas including their cloud-native and DevSecOps capabilities as well as their professional and managed services abilities.

Gartner’s Critical Capabilities for Public Cloud IT Transformation Services report offers insight specifically focusing on public cloud transformation with partners needing to hold specializations or certifications from the likes Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud and/or Microsoft Azure.

The leading companies that made Gartner’sdeliver positive business impacts born from IT transformation with customer engagements being application-led compared to infrastructure-led.

Other key aspects Gartner took into consideration when scoring these companies were their cloud-native engineering application development multi-cloud and security compliance capabilities. Companies also needed to show large professional and managed services revenues skilled employees and customer-base.

CRN breaks down the top 10 companies that captured Gartner’s highest scores in each of the five use case categories.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhdGFuYW1pLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzA0L29ubHktMTItb2YtYWktdXNlcnMtYXJlLW1heGltaXppbmctaXQtYWNjZW50dXJlLXNheXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Only 12% of AI Users Are Maximizing It Accenture Says,"A new study from Accenture says just 12% of firms have figured out how to deploy AI to “achieve superior growth and business transformation.” In other words there’s quite a bit of work yet to be done when it comes to AI success.

The correlation between AI use and business achievement is still positive. As far back as 2019 Accenture noted that top AI achievers see 50% better revenue growth than their peers who are not AI experts. No one is calling for an AI rethink yet progress seems to be coming painfully slowly in the real-world branch of the AI discussion.

As previously noted in its recently released Art of AI Maturity Report Accenture found that just 12% of companies surveyed are enjoying big success due to AI while another 25% are “somewhat advanced” in their AI maturity. The remaining 63% of the 1200 enterprises surveyed are still “testing the AI waters” the consulting group found.

However that relative low level of AI achievement won’t last long. Accenture predicts that the share of AI achievers will increase rapidly going from 12% today to 27% by 2024. (That prediction comes from Accenture’s machine learning models the firm states.)

The secret to success with AI Accenture says doesn’t come from any one AI capability but instead comes from the ability of an organization “to combine strengths across strategy processes and people.”

Specifically Accenture found five things that high AI achievers do differently including:

Top leaders champion AI as a strategic priority for the whole organization; Invest heavily in talent; Industrialize AI tools and teams “to create a strong AI core”; Design AI responsibly from the start; Prioritize long- and short-term AI investments.

Accenture sees parallels between the AI adoption curve and what companies have experienced with digital transformation (while the two business imperatives are related they are not one and the same). The good news is that based on an analysis of the use of words like “AI” “digital” and “business transformation” in earnings calls with top executives Accenture sees progress coming faster with companies’ AI initiatives than what it saw with digital transformation projects.

“The incentive to move quickly is strong” Accenture wrote in its report. “We found for example that the share of companies’ revenue that is ‘AI-influenced’ more than doubled between 2018 and 2021 and is expected to roughly triple between 2018 and 2024.”

A key element in finding success with AI is operationalizing the technology which is something that has dogged many machine learning projects. Getting from a data science project to full-scale production isn’t easy and requires expertise not only hard skills in data and AI but also soft skills like organizational strategy talent and culture the consulting group found.

The stakes are high–but the opportunities are even higher. Who wins the race to become high AI achievers will determine who wins in business according to Sanjeev Vohra global lead for applied intelligence at Accenture.

“We believe every part of every business must be transformed by technology data and AI in some cases resulting in total enterprise reinvention” Vohra stated in a press release. “AI Achievers are showing their peers what’s possible when you release the full potential of talent and technology working in tandem supported by a clear vision and commitment to change. But even this most mature group has plenty of room for growth. And while most industries have AI Achievers they vary greatly in how AI-mature they are overall and the leaps they will make.”

Establishing a workflow from beginning to end is the best way to get started. This article will guide you through every step of the process.

Getting started in Adobe Premiere Pro can be a daunting task for the first-time user or even those familiar with other Adobe products like Photoshop and Illustrator. When I first started I didn’t even know the proper way to open a project! But after learning a straightforward and structured workflow I was able to learn video editing from start to finish.

To be the most practical let’s go through an example video using a common workflow. These Adobe Premiere tips will take you from the very beginning to the absolute end of the video editing process in Premiere.

1. Gather and log your media

First step -- Collect all the media (footage audio graphics) you plan to use. It’s OK to add more media as you continue through the editing process but it’s most efficient to have the vast majority of your media organized before you get started. Arranging your project folder properly is highly encouraged.

The next step in the pre-editing process is logging footage or labeling your footage. The labels should be a description of the shot to help you easily identify and organize clips. For example a clip may be labeled 12/20/20_coupleinkitchen_CU_03: it has the date a quick description of the shot the shot type and the take number. I suggest logging footage whether your project has two files or two thousand.

If you have only a handful of files you’re working with it’s easy to log the footage prior to opening up a project. If you have far more files you can label the files within Adobe video editor.

2. Create a new project and sequence

When opening a project in Premiere Pro for the first time it’s best to stick with default settings. You only have to pay attention to two things: The project name and the location. The name is self-explanatory but the location is where your project is saved so make sure it’s directed to your project folder and you can find it later.

Once you open up to a blank editing workspace drag and drop your project folder from your hard drive into the project panel. Your files will populate as you have them organized and you’re almost ready to get editing!

To finally get started you need to create a new sequence. You can do this a couple of ways: Drag and drop a clip from your project panel into the timeline and it will create a sequence with the same settings as the clip (e.g. 1920 x 1080 29.97 frames per second).

Or you can use the shortcut Command+N on Mac or Control+N on a PC to open up the settings for a new sequence. When creating a new sequence from scratch take note of these settings:

Timebase: Should match or be lower than that of your footage -- 23.97 and 29.97 are most common.

Should match or be lower than that of your footage -- 23.97 and 29.97 are most common. Frame size: Should match your footage or the platform you intend to post on. For example a typical HD video is 1920 x 1080 with an aspect ratio of 16:9; an Instagram-type video will be 1080 x 1080 with a 1:1 aspect ratio.

Working with frame rates and frame sizes different from your footage will cause issues so to make things easier I recommend dragging and dropping a clip to initiate a sequence. If you’re using your video for omnichannel marketing purposes it is especially important that these settings fit each platform you post to.

3. Create a stringout in the timeline

Now it’s time to start piecing together your video. The process of constructing your story from the media you imported is referred to as creating a stringout -- think of it as a really rough cut.

Depending on the size and type of project you may go through the process of choosing selects before you create a stringout. Choosing selects refers to picking the best takes from each scene. If you’re creating a short social media video you’ll likely skip choosing selects; it’s more common to do this for large TV or movie projects.

To create your stringout:

Navigate to the project panel and double-click the footage or audio you want to work with. The media will populate in the source monitor. Use the source monitor to trim down your footage or audio to the parts you want. Using the command “I” will choose an in point or starting point and the command “O” will choose an out point or ending point. Transfer your selection to the timeline using the comma or period key.

The above system is referred to as three-point editing and is the most efficient way to edit in most video editing software. You can also drag and drop media from your project panel straight into the timeline and trim from there.

4. Fine-tune the edit

Now that you have a rough layout of your video in the timeline it’s time to polish it. This step could consist of a range of actions: trimming clips or expanding clips syncing audio and video more precisely or developing a pace among other things.

There aren’t many practical tips to this step it’s just getting to your video to the point where there is no more trimming cutting or rearranging. You want the placement and duration of your clips to be set before jumping into the next steps.

5. Sound design

Premiere has a good number of tools for audio editing and mixing. At the very least you should adjust your volume levels. For this example there is both a voice track and music track on the timeline and we’ll look at ducking the music levels so the voice track can break through.

There are a few ways to do this but let’s look at Premiere’s audio assign function:

Open the audio workspace Toggle the voice track in the timeline In the right panel under Essential Sound you’ll see the options to assign a tag to the audio clip Assign the Dialogue tag Toggle your music track and assign the Music tag While in the Music tag select the Smooth Vocal Ducking preset Adjust the amount you want the music to fade using the Duck Amount slider Click Generate Keyframes

All done! Now when the voice track comes in the music will fade slightly underneath the voice volume. Audio mixing can sometimes be overlooked but it’s one of the components of a great video.

6. Transitions and effects

Seamless transitions and cool effects are a great way to support a theme add style and assist in timing. Take your time and do a deep-dive into the collection of transitions and effects Premiere Pro offers and the best ways to use them. For this Adobe Premiere Pro tutorial let’s add a push transition between two clips and drop an offset effect on top of one of the clips.

Adding a push transition:

Open the Effects workspace Open the Video Transitions drop down menu Open the Slide drop down menu Drag and drop Push Transition on the end of the first clip Adjust the duration direction and other settings in the Effects Control panel

Adding offset effect:

Open the Effects Workspace Open Video Effects drop down menu Open Distort drop down menu Drag and drop Offset onto the desired clip In the Effects control panel adjust the “Shift Center To” setting

7. Motion graphics

Motion graphics continue to gain popularity and it seems you can’t create a video without them anymore. They are excellent for title sequences lower thirds and more. Let’s add a title to this video using one of the templates in the Graphics workspace:

Open the Graphics workspace. Hover over the templates for a preview until you spot one you like. Drag and drop right onto your timeline. Double-click your template in the timeline to change the text . Adjust all the other settings in the Effects Control window.

As you continue to work with these templates you’ll get a better grasp of the Effects Control window in Adobe video editing and the adjustments you can make there. To start it’s OK to leave the default settings.

8. Export

You’re all done! Now it’s time to export your work to your social media account landing page videographer website and everywhere else. There’s a lot of export settings but we’re going to focus on the format and preset options for quick and easy encoding.

Format: H.264 --The format is also known as a codec and is how the video is compressed and decompressed (CoDec) for sending and opening. I recommend using H.264 almost always because it’s excellent for file size management and is compatible almost everywhere.

--The format is also known as a codec and is how the video is compressed and decompressed (CoDec) for sending and opening. I recommend using H.264 almost always because it’s excellent for file size management and is compatible almost everywhere. Preset: Match Source Medium Bitrate -- The preset will determine your video settings so you want those to match your sequence settings. The bitrate will determine the quality of the video. Unless your video is loaded with 3D rendering heavy color grading and endless effects you’ll be fine with medium bitrate.

Customizing your workflow

The above workflow is a useful basic editing guide for beginners. As you continue to edit you’ll tailor the system to fit your editing style and add steps like color correction and advanced compositing.

Of course you don’t have to follow the outline exactly. But use this template as a starting point and soon enough you’ll have your own workflow down to a tee!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zaWxpdmUuY29tL2RpbmluZy8yMDIyLzA4L2Fkb2JlLWJsdWVzLXVuZGVyLW5ldy1vd25lcnNoaXAtaGVyZXMtd2hhdHMtY2hhbmdlZC1hbmQtd2hlbi15b3UtY2FuLWV4cGVjdC1kb29ycy13aWxsLXJlb3Blbi5odG1s0gGXAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpbGl2ZS5jb20vZGluaW5nLzIwMjIvMDgvYWRvYmUtYmx1ZXMtdW5kZXItbmV3LW93bmVyc2hpcC1oZXJlcy13aGF0cy1jaGFuZ2VkLWFuZC13aGVuLXlvdS1jYW4tZXhwZWN0LWRvb3JzLXdpbGwtcmVvcGVuLmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Adobe Blues under new ownership: Here’s what’s changed and when you can expect doors will reopen,"STATEN ISLAND N.Y. — Earlier this year Adobe Blues changed ownership and almost immediately the new proprietors started sprucing up the long-standing Southwestern-themed saloon.

You can make one in that program ( File > Save as Template ) or download premade templates ( File > New ).

> ) or download premade templates ( > ). Conversions to PDF AI and other formats are supported.

This article explains what an AIT file is and how to open one on your computer or convert one to a different format like FXG EPS and SVG.

What Is an AIT File?

A file with the AIT file extension is an Illustrator template file that's used to create multiple Adobe Illustrator (.AI) files.

AIT files hold the different components of an Illustrator drawing including the images settings and layout and are useful when working with projects that should have a similar pre-formatted design like brochures business cards etc.

Creating an AIT file is done through the program's File > Save as Template menu.

AIT also stands for some terms unrelated to this file format like advanced intelligent tape automated information system and artificial intelligence technology.

How to Open an AIT File

Of course Adobe Illustrator will open AIT files. Some people have had luck using CorelDRAW using the Import function in that program.

How to Save an AIT File

The benefit to an AIT file is that when opened Illustrator makes a copy of it so that you're not editing the original and therefore not overwriting the template with new information. In other words when you open an AIT file make changes and then go to save it you'll be prompted to save it somewhere as an AI file not an AIT file.

Saving the file in the AI format is a good thing because it's the whole point of an AIT file—to provide a similar building block for creating AI files. Of course this also means that you can't make changes to an AIT file as quickly as you can with an AI file.

That said if you do want to edit the template you can save it as a new file but then choose the AIT file extension instead of AI overwriting the existing AIT file. Another option would be to use the File > Save as Template option instead of the regular Save As menu.

How to Convert an AIT File

When you open an AIT file in Illustrator you can save the file to a new format with the File > Save As menu. Some supported formats include AI FXG PDF EPS and SVG.

You can also export the AIT file to a DWG DXF BMP EMF SWF JPG PCT PSD PNG TGA TXT TIF or WMF file using Adobe Illustrator's File Export menu.

Still Can't Open the File?

If Illustrator isn't opening your file check that you're reading the file extension correctly. Many file extensions look incredibly similar but that doesn't mean they can be opened with the same programs.

AIR ITL AIFF/AIF/AIFC ATI (Office Accounting Updated Company) and ALT (Dynamics AX Temporary) files are a few examples.

If you still can't get your file to open try opening it as a text file with a free text editor. Most formats even if they're not text-based have something readable that can help identify what type of file it is.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbXB1dGVyd2Vla2x5LmNvbS9uZXdzLzI1MjUyMzQ5NS9CYXllcm4tTXVuaWNoLXNpZGVzLXdpdGgtQWRvYmUtdG8tZW5oYW5jZS1nbG9iYWwtZmFuLWV4cGVyaWVuY2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bayern Munich sides with Adobe to enhance global fan experience,"Bayern Munich is following Real Madrid in bidding to connect better with its fans globally using Adobe’s Experience Cloud software.

FC Bayern which dominates German football is attracting fans globally in the same way as the Spanish giants Real and Barcelona and English Premiership sides with long-established global brands such as Manchester United Liverpool and Chelsea. Manchester City comes just after United in Statista’s list of the most valuable football brands just ahead of FC Bayern München.

Bayern has been the Bundesliga champions for 10 years in a row with the better-supported Borussia Dortmund – in terms of fans in the stadium – the last other team to come top.

Bayern hopes Adobe’s technology will provide it with the ability to better understand its fans in Germany and beyond to create more engaging and individualised football experiences.

By doing so the club hopes it has found a “new way to attract and retain fans all around the world to stop their supporters overseas being tempted into switching allegiances”. Such international fans are likely to be more fickle than the Ultras of the Sudkurve of the Allianz Arena.

The club will use Adobe Experience Cloud the supplier’s customer relationship management (CRM) platform which includes a customer data platform to create fan profiles. The idea is to enhance the fans matchday experience by giving real-time notifications about merch discounts video content and last-minute ticket availability.

As an example when a goal is scored fans will receive content on their preferred channel as well as post-match video commentary and highlights.

Oliver Kahn CEO of FC Bayern and a former goalkeeper for the side said in a joint statement with Adobe: “Today’s FC Bayern fan is digitally savvy and craves new ways to get closer to our club and players which is why we aim to create sustainable and lasting interactions that bring matchday excitement to our millions of passionate fans across the world.

“We’re investing in a long-term digital strategy with Adobe’s breadth of enterprise applications at the core of our technology to deepen how our fans engage with the club and to inspire the next generation of fans for years to come.”

The club is also using Adobe Document Cloud including Adobe Acrobat Sign to “digitise collaboration with fans employees and partners” it said adding that membership applications will also be faster for fans.

For Adobe Anil Chakravarthy president of Digital Experience Business at the supplier said: “FC Bayern has millions of fans around the world and they are at the forefront of revolutionising fan experiences.

“With this partnership FC Bayern will create more personalised experiences to enable fans to celebrate the passion and heart of the club wherever they may be.”"

Investors had been anxiously awaiting the second-quarter earnings report from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.80%) earlier this week especially after a report from Intel (INTC 0.30%) last week showed it had missed revenue and earnings estimates by a wide margin.

But AMD said it beat analyst estimates for revenue and earnings when it reported on Aug. 2. That strongly indicates Intel's challenges are more internal than a reflection of all semiconductor stocks.

Based on AMD's report investors are now wondering whether AMD will take a permanent lead over Intel or if there's still hope for an Intel comeback?

AMD's earnings and Intel

Despite the stock price dropping in next-day trading AMD's Q2 earnings report actually indicated mostly good news. Revenue of $6.55 billion increased 70% year over year and beat consensus estimates of $6.53 billion. It also outperformed Intel whose revenue dropped by 22% over the same period.

Moreover AMD's non-GAAP income of $1.71 billion or $1.05 per share exceeded estimates of $1.03 per share. But while non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) income increased 119% from 12 months ago GAAP income fell 37% to $447 million. Considerable increases in research and development and marketing general and administrative expenses weighed on GAAP earnings. Also amortization of intangibles related to its acquisitions further reduced GAAP income.

In Intel's defense AMD confirmed sector-related weakness in PC sales and gaming. However AMD reported an 83% revenue increase in data center revenue year over year. This stands in contrast to Intel's 16% revenue decline in its data center and artificial intelligence (AI) group for the same time frame.

Additionally AMD forecasts a 60% revenue increase for 2022. With Intel predicting an 11% revenue decline for 2022 at the midpoint AMD appears poised to continue making gains on its longtime rival.

The ongoing competition

Worse for Intel AMD said on its Q2 2022 earnings call that it will begin selling 5-nanometer (nm) processors in Q2. Soon after Pat Gelsinger became Intel CEO in 2021 he set Intel a goal of catching up to its peers technologically by 2024 and achieving industry leadership in 2025. He reiterated that goal on the Q2 earnings call.

However Intel currently produces 10-nm chips and has not yet released its upcoming 7-nm chip. That places it far behind AMD which has sold 7-nm chips since 2019. Given Intel's performance it is little wonder Intel's stock is roughly flat over the last five years while AMD stock logged massive gains.

Still Intel could recover eventually. The day it released its disappointing earnings report the CHIPS Act passed Congress. With its numerous foundries in the U.S. Intel should gain a considerable subsidy from this legislation. The legislation will not directly help AMD as the company outsources all production to partner semiconductor fabrication plants (fabs) such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing or GlobalFoundries. Also with Intel planning to enter the fab business through Intel Foundry Services it will likely add an additional source of revenue.

Still fabs take years to build and Intel's bid to catch up technologically is a three-to-five-year process. This means that Intel will likely remain behind AMD technologically for a long time to come even if its ambitious plans succeed.

AMD vs. Intel

Intel's Q2 earnings report does not spell permanent doom but the current earnings report indicates any comeback is a long way off assuming it occurs at all. With AMD firing on all cylinders and Intel not yet showing results AMD should lead this competition for the foreseeable future.

Admittedly Intel has steadily improved its technology and entering the foundry business should eventually pay off for the chipmaker. But until Intel's plans begin to produce results investors should consider staying with AMD.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJmh0dHBzOi8vY2FwaXRhbC5jb20vYW1kLXN0b2NrLWZvcmVjYXN00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AMD Stock Forecast | Is AMD a Good Stock to Buy?,"Advanced Micro Devices logo on the building – Photo: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com

The stock price of US tech firm Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has been in the slump for more than seven months.

Despite solid operational and financial performance in the second quarter AMD stock has lost 32% of its value year-to-date (YTD). Weakening global sales of personal computers (PC) due persisted supply chain problems and inflationary pressures have raised concerns over semiconductor demand.

Will these issues continue to cap AMD stock price or will the stock reverse its downtrend? In this article we look into AMD's historical price its latest earnings and news that could help to form a plausible AMD stock forecast.

The Advanced Micro Devices story

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is a global technology company based in the United States that produces a wide range of processors graphics video and multimedia products.

Based in Santa Clara California AMD is a global leader in the microprocessor industry. The company’s products include accelerated processing units (APU) graphics processing units (GPUs) and System-on-Chip (SoC). It also produces server processors and technology for game consoles.

AMD invests in high-performance GPUs and software for markets such as gaming artificial intelligence cloud gaming and virtual and augmented reality.

Jerry Sanders and seven former employees of Fairchild Semiconductor founded AMD in 1969 in Sunnyvale California. Fairchild Semiconductor was a pioneer in integrated circuits and transistors production.

Three years after its establishment the company issued 620000 shares of common stock for over-the-counter (OTC) trading at $15.50 a share on 27 September 1972. It raised a total of $7.5m from the public offering. In October 1979 AMD debuted on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). However it transferred its stock to the NASDAQ Stock Exchange on 2 January 2015.

AMD initially concentrated on producing logic chips. The Am2501 logic counter the company's first proprietary product was released in 1970 and was a huge success. To attract more customers AMD started to broaden its products to include high-performance memories and networking.

The company expanded its business as its customer base increased opening an assembly plant in Malaysia and increasing the size of its headquarters in Sunnyvale. In just five years after its establishment AMD was manufacturing more than 200 products – many of them proprietary and had close to $25.5m in annual sales according to Silicon Valley Historical Association.

Today AMD products power a broad-range of consumer electronic products from laptops personal computers to gaming devices and cloud computing. Clients including Meta (FB) Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT). Its processors power notebooks and PCs produced by top producers including Dell and Hewlett-Packard (HPE).

AMD stock performance

In the past five years the chip maker’s share value has been in the uptrend surging about 656% (as of 3 August 2022).

AMD has also delivered trailing returns of 37.98% over the last 10 years outperforming the industry's 20.38% based on Morningstar’s data as of 3 August.

Buoyed by the semiconductor demand boom during the Covid-19 pandemic the company’s share value nearly doubled in 2020 and gained 56.9% in 2021.

In 2022 the trend reversed and the AMD stock price headed downward.

Monetary tightening in the US and elsewhere has raised concerns about recession which could hurt demand for consumer electronics including PC laptops and games. In addition the slump in crypto markets has heightened worries about demand for GPU used in crypto mining.

The stock was traded at $99.29 on 2 August about 39% below its 52-week high of $164.46 hit in late November 2021. At the time of writing (3 August) the stock has dropped 32% since the start of the year according to TradingView data.

2Q earnings beat estimate

Advanced Micro Devices still delivered better-than-expected earnings results in the second quarter of this year. The chip maker’s revenue in the second quarter jumped 70% to $6.55bn up from $3.85bn in the prior-year period the company announced on 2 August.

Reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.05 beat analysts’ estimates of $0.90 as tracked by MarketBeat.

All four segments – data center client gaming and embedded – reported solid revenue growth in the quarter.

Data center’s revenue grew 83% year-over-year (YoY) to $1.5bn in the second quarter driven by strong sales of its EPYC server processors. Client segment booked revenue of $2.2bn a 25% increase YoY boosted by sales of Ryzen mobile processors.

The gaming segment revenue increased 32% YoY to $1.7bn on higher semi-custom product sales which offset a decline in gaming graphics revenue. Embedded segment revenue soared 2228% YoY to $1.3bn driven by the inclusion of Xilinx embedded revenue. AMD acquired Xilinx in February 2022.

The company generated a record $1.04bn cash from operations in the second quarter compared to $952m a year ago.

For the third quarter of 2022 AMD expects revenue to be $6.7bn plus or minus $200m. It represents a 55% increase YoY led by growth in the Data Center and Embedded segments.

AMD has kept its revenue target for the full year of 2022 at $26.3bn plus or minus $300m which is an increase 60% over 2021 led by growth in the Data Center and Embedded segments.

AMD stock forecast: Latest news and price drivers

Slowing PC sales globally is one of its main concerns including AMD.

According to Gartner global PC shipments in the second quarter of 2022 fell 12.6% YoY to 72 million units the sharpest decline for the global PC market in nine years. The company reported that sales dropped in all regional markets amid geopolitical economic and supply chain challenges.

“The decline we saw in the first quarter of 2022 has accelerated in the second quarter driven by the ongoing geopolitical instability caused by the Russian Invasion of Ukraine inflationary pressure on spending and a steep downturn in demand for Chromebooks” said Mikako Kitagawa Gartner’s research director in a statement on 11 July.

PC delivery had suffered delays due to logistics disruptions with buyers experiencing longer lead times although it has begun to improve partly due to reopening key cities in China from fresh Covid-19 lockdowns by end of the second quarter Kitagawa said.

“To maintain profits as inflation increases costs the PC industry is having to raise average selling prices (ASPs) despite weakening demand” Kitagawa added.

While AMD reported strong revenue for Client segment which include desktop and notebook PC processors AMD Chair and CEO Lisa Su acknowledged softening global PC sales.

“Taking a step back while there has been additional softness in the PC market in recent months we believe we are very well positioned to navigate through the current environment based on the strength of our existing product portfolio and upcoming product launches” said Su in the company’s earnings call with analysts on 2 August.

“We are being more conservative in our PC outlook. Our PC outlook now at mid-teens would kind of put the market at somewhere around let's call it 290 million to 300 million units. So I do think we've appropriately de-risked the PC business” she added.

COLUMBUS Ga. Aug. 4 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Aflac Incorporated today announced the introduction of two new consumer-directed products: Aflac Final Expense Whole Life Insurance and Aflac Medicare Supplement Insurance. These products — underwritten by Tier One Insurance Company a subsidiary of Aflac Incorporated — are part of a robust portfolio of supplemental coverage options for those unable to access Aflac products through the workplace.

""This product expansion represents not only new offerings but a bold new senior strategy that leverages Aflac's strong brand recognition and affinity particularly with retiring Americans who are seeking to continue their trusted relationship with Aflac by supplementing their Medicare benefits"" said Aflac U.S. Deputy President Virgil Miller. ""In providing this competitive product lineup to seniors we have partnered to support product development risk transfer and administration.""

Aflac Final Expense Whole Life Insurance

With Aflac Final Expense Whole Life Insurance policyholders can help protect their loved ones' financial security by helping to pay for end-of-life expenses not covered under Medicare and other programs while also encouraging families to address uncomfortable discussions about final expenses.

""Processing the loss of a loved one takes an emotional toll on families and many often face financial stress while grieving. It is important for families and individuals to be prepared in order to help alleviate the financial burdens placed on loved ones during intensely sensitive times"" said Jeramy Tipton SVP Distribution Expansion and Consumer Markets. ""End-of-life medical legal and funeral costs can be substantial. Aflac Final Expense is designed to help take that weight off grieving families' shoulders so they can focus on what matters.""

The average out-of-pocket medical expenses during one's last year of life can total nearly $10000.1 In addition to these expenses there are often significant costs involved when settling a loved one's estate and the median funeral expenses are almost $8000.2 Considering that nearly 50% of American workers say they would not be able to pay more than $1000 in out-of-pocket medical costs in the event of an accident or injury3 Aflac's Final Expense Whole Life Insurance can help protect loved ones from inherited expenses.

Aflac's Final Expense Whole Life Insurance is available in two options: the Level Plan and the Modified Plan. Both plans include a guaranteed level premium — meaning premiums will never increase — and a guaranteed death benefit paid to the beneficiary while the policy is active. Plans are available for individuals age 45 to 80. Benefit amounts range from $2000 to $50000 depending on the plan selected. The level plan also offers the option to elect accelerated and accidental death benefit riders as well as a children's term insurance rider.

Aflac Medicare Supplement Insurance

While Medicare provides coverage for health-related expenses it doesn't cover all costs — such as copayments coinsurance and deductibles. Because consumers need a way to help manage expenses during retirement Aflac introduced its Medicare Supplement Insurance policies to help fill some of these coverage gaps.

""Seniors have worked their entire lives toward this milestone: retirement"" said Tipton. ""With the addition of Medicare Supplement Insurance we are able to help reduce the burden of financial stress so that policyholders can focus on enjoying their retirement years as much as possible.""

With Aflac's Medicare Supplement plans A F G and N consumers will have the freedom to choose any provider that accepts Medicare at a convenient location that best meets their needs without precertification or pre-authorization. Plan benefits remain the same year after year and are portable so if policyholders move or travel their coverage goes with them.

To better serve the non-workplace individual market Aflac's Final Expense Whole Life Insurance and Medicare Supplement Insurance join other offerings including Accident Cancer and Critical Illness products that launched last year. Aflac's consumer markets portfolio of individual insurance products is available through Aflac Tier One distribution partners and direct to consumers by visiting Aflac.com.

The dollar’s 15 percent rise in value against the yen in the last three months also impacted results with the weaker yen showing up as lower revenue when converted into dollars for accounting purposes.

Overall global profit for the Columbus-based firm grew 25.6 percent to nearly $1.4 billion during the second quarter on slightly lower revenue of $5.4 billion. The increase in earnings was driven in part by more than a half-billion dollars in net investment gains driven by currency and derivative moves.

In Japan however which accounts for about 60 percent of Aflac’s revenues results were more muted. Premiums on a yen basis fell by 4.2 percent during the quarter to Y312.2 billion but investment incomes climbed by 8.4 percent to Y94 billion as interest rates rose and dollar-denominated assets saw their relative value increase. Aflac Japan overall saw revenues fall 1.6 percent to Y408.3 billion or about $3 billion.

Translated into dollars premiums in Japan dropped 19 percent and overall revenues by almost 17 percent demonstrating how the dollar’s dramatic strength is hitting the bottom line in the company’s largest market. Earnings per share were down 8.2 percent to $1.46 on a constant-currency basis from $1.55 in the year-ago period but excluding the impact of the weak yen they fell just 2.5 percent to $1.55.

Japan also saw slow sales growth as it continues to emerge from the worst of the pandemic. Many cancer insurance and other supplemental policies reached paid-up status at the same time in-person sales — the preferred purchase method for citizens who buy at banks department stores and (as of 2015) 20000 Japan Post locations — became challenging as restrictions on movement became more prevalent. New sales in Japan dropped by 10.7 percent in the quarter to ¥24.7 billion or $201 million.

Chairman and CEO Daniel P. Amos said the pandemic “impacted our ability to meet face-to-face with customers which continues to be key to a recovery in sales.”

He expected “stronger sales in the second half of the year assuming that those conditions subside productivity continues to improve at Japan Post and we execute on our product introduction and refreshment plans.”

Patient samples were collected according to Dutch research guidelines of the Federation of Dutch Medical Scientific Societies (FDMSS) as described in “Human Tissue and Medical Research: Code of Conduct for Responsible use”. When required patients provided informed consent for sampling additional tumor tissue for study purposes. Patients did not receive any compensation. In this study we used tumor samples from 52 patients with peritoneal metastases collected at the Amsterdam University Medical Center location VUmc between 2010 and 2018. Eligibility criteria for inclusion were: histologically proven colorectal carcinoma with synchronous or metachronous peritoneal metastasis age older than 18 years and fresh frozen tissue available. The detailed clinical and histopathological characteristics of this cohort are described in Supplementary Data 1.

Tissue sample collection

Tissues were obtained from CRC patients with synchronous or metachronous peritoneal metastases. We collected 172 samples from 52 patients including 8 primary tumors. Fresh tumor tissue was obtained immediately after surgical excision prior to HIPEC treatment and after a macroscopic examination a sample selection of the peritoneal metastasis and for some patients also the primary tumors were frozen down for storage at −80 °C.

Pathological analysis

All samples were reviewed by a gastrointestinal pathologist (L.K.) for tumor content based on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissue sections. From each tumor an H&E section was available of the top and bottom part of the isolated sample. From both slides the tumor content was reviewed. All samples with an estimated mean cancer cell content above 30% were included for isolation. Data on tumor grade and histology were extracted from the original pathological reports. H&E sections were scanned and exported using Philips Digital Pathology software.

RNA and DNA isolation

Frozen tissue samples were cut in 20-µm-thick cryosections with a cryostat up to about 30 mg for each sample. All tissue samples were maintained at −80 °C until RNA extraction. Frozen samples were immersed in RLT buffer (AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit Qiagen) and disrupted and homogenized using TissueLyser LT (Qiagen). Total RNA and DNA were isolated simultaneously from tissue lysates using the AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA and DNA concentration was measured using NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific) and Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The RNA integrity was measured using the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Only samples with an RIN (RNA integrity number) >6.7 were subjected to further analysis.

Bulk RNA sequencing data processing

Libraries were prepared using Kapa mRNA HyperPrep sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq (Single Read 50 bp). The quality control of the single-end reads was assessed by FastQC (available online at: http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). RNA-seq transcript quantification was performed by mapping the high-quality reads to the GRCh38 human transcriptome by using the software RSEM55 and the STAR aligner56. The RSEM output corresponding to the liver metastatic samples were downloaded from the recount2 repository57 using the accession code SRP029880. The RSEM outputs containing the estimated counts were imported into R (R Core Team 2020) and summarized into matrices by the R package tximport (v1.18.0)58. Detailed description of the RNA sequencing analysis pipeline is available at: https://github.com/vermeulenlab/peritoneal_metastasis59.

CMS classification

Molecular subtype classification was performed based on gene profile expression as described before22. Briefly raw count matrix of RNA-seq was transformed by variance stabilizing transformation60 and gene identifiers were converted from gene Symbol to Entrez gene ids using the R package org.Hs.eg.db (genome-wide annotation for Human. R package version 3.8.2. Carlson 2019). The processed matrix was used as input for the ‘single-sample predictor’ (SSP) classifier part of the (‘CMSclassifier’ v1.0.0) R package setting the option method = “SSP”. Since the SSP classifier does not use predefined probabilities for the subtypes misclassification due to altered distribution of CMSs in the peritoneal metastasis set is avoided. The heatmap for visualizing the gene expression of the most discriminant genes across the CMS subtypes was built by the software ComplexHeatMap (v2.6.2)61. Detailed description of the CMS classification methods is available at: https://github.com/vermeulenlab/peritoneal_metastasis59.

Unsupervised sub-clustering of CMS4 samples

Samples of the CMS4 subtype were unsupervised clustered in order to identify intrinsic groups sharing biological characteristics using the R package ConsensusClusterPlus (v1.54.0)62 setting clusterAlg = ”pam” and distance = ”pearson” and using the 500 most variable genes across the samples calculated by the R function median absolute deviation (mad). The optimal number of subgroups was further assessed by the R function silhouette. To evaluate the potential clustering of the CMS4 PM dataset (n = 45) we used Hopkins statistic (R package “Clustertend” version 1.5) to calculate the score representing the clustering tendency. We compared the obtained Hopkins score in the CMS4 PM dataset against: (1) the Guinney CRC dataset22 randomly selecting 1000 samples that were previously classified as one of the CMS subtypes; (2) the Guinney CRC dataset selecting only samples that were previously classified as CMS4 subtype; (3) a simulated dataset containing uniform data distribution and therefore with low potential clustering. Median absolute deviation (MAD) was used to select the 1000 most variable genes used as input for the calculation. Detailed description of scripts used for the sub-clustering of CMS4 PM samples is available at: https://github.com/vermeulenlab/peritoneal_metastasis59.

Deconvolution of RNA-seq

To conduct the cell type deconvolution of the bulk RNA-seq samples we employed the deep learning-based method Scaden (v0.9.4)63. In short the processed single-cell data and metadata of 23 colorectal cancer patients were downloaded from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) accession code GSE132465 and used as a training dataset. The function ‘scaden train’ was applied to construct the Scaden ensemble model using 5000 training steps and 30000 samples. Scripts used for deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq are available at https://github.com/vermeulenlab/peritoneal_metastasis59.

Single nuclei RNA sequencing and data processing

Nuclei were prepared for 10x Genomics-based single nuclei RNA sequencing analysis according to a previously published protocol64. Briefly each frozen sample was thawed and macerated in CST buffer for 10 min filtered (70 micron pluriStrainer) and spun at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet nuclei. Nuclei were resuspended in the same buffer without detergent filtered (10 micron pluriStrainer) and counted using AOPI on a Nexcelom Cellometer. Approximately 10000 nuclei were loaded immediately into each channel of a 10x Chromium chip (10x Genomics) using 5-prime V2 chemistry according to the manufacturer’s protocol (10x Genomics #CG000330). The resulting cDNA and indexed libraries were checked for quality on an Agilent 4200 TapeStation and then quantified and pooled for sequencing on an Illumina NextSeq 550. Single-cell sequencing data were aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh38) and processed using the CellRanger 3.1.0 software from 10x Genomics to generate unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts. The raw gene expression matrices were imported into R (R Core Team 2020) and further processed by the Seurat R package version 3.2.2 (filter < 10% of mitochondrial gene expression and >200 unique gene counts (nFeature_RNA) < 4000) and normalized by SCTransform with regression for nFeature_RNA and the percent mitochondria. Cell clusters were visualized using the UMAP algorithm with the first 10 principal components as input. The major cell populations were annotated by comparing the gene markers for each cluster identified using the Seurat function FindAllMarkers and canonical marker genes. More details on single nuclei RNA-seq data processing are available at https://github.com/vermeulenlab/peritoneal_metastasis59. To compare single cells derived from liver metastasis and paired primary tumors publicly available data was used from Che et al.43.

Mutation analysis

NGS was performed using a custom targeted NGS amplicon panel consisting of the following genes: APC TP53 KRAS NRAS BRAF PIK3CA SMAD4 FBWX7 CTNNB1 POLE POLD1 PTEN ACVR2A BMPR2 RNF43 ZNRF3 MLH1 MSH2 MSH3 MSH6 and PMS2. DNA libraries were produced using the custom Ion AmpliSeq Panel (Life Technologies Bleiswijk the Netherlands) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Libraries were barcoded (Ion Xpress Barcodes adapters kit Life Technologies) and quantified using a Qubit dsDNA HS assay kit (Life Technologies). Tumor DNA libraries were sequenced on a 530v1 chip in the Personal Genome Machine system (Ion Torrent Life Technologies). Torrent suite software v5.10.1 was used for signal processing run quality reports and to generate BAM files. Sequences were analyzed using SeqNext software v4.1.2 (JSI Medical Systems GmbH Ettenheim Germany). The target sequencing depth was 1500× per amplicon. For mutation calling a variant allele fraction (VAF) cutoff value of 5% was used.

Microsatellite instability analysis

MSI status of the samples was determined using the MSI Analysis System version 1.2 (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were considered MSI-high (MSI-H) MSI-low (MSI-L) or MSS when more than two one or zero out of five markers (BAT-25 BAT-26 MON0-27 NR-21 and NR-24) were instable respectively.

DNA copy number analysis

Genomic DNA was isolated from each sample and measured with Illumina GSA Beadchip (Illumina GSA Arrays “Infinium iSelect 24×1 HTS Custom Beadchip Kit”). GenomeStudio was used with standard settings to obtain copy numbers from the SNP data. Generated LogR values were segmented using circular binary segmentation via the DNAcopy R package (version 1.58.0) and frequency plots were generated using the same package. Shallow sequencing and analysis of matching primary CRC and peritoneal metastasis was performed as described previously65. In short DNA from fresh frozen samples was sheared on a Covaris S2 (Covaris) sample preparation was performed with the TruSeq DNA kit V2 (Illumina). After end repair and 39 adenylation adapter ligation was performed with 1 mL of adapter. Final sequence library amplification was performed with 8 PCR cycles using the following program: start with 30 s 98 °C 8 cycles of 10 s 98 °C 30 s 60 °C and 30 s 72 °C end with 5 min 72 °C. Sequence library yield was assessed with a Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 and/or HS DNA (Agilent Technologies). Libraries were equimolarly pooled with 18–22 barcoded samples and 7 pM molarity loaded per lane of a HiSeq Single End Flowcell (Illumina). This was followed by cluster generation on a cBot (Illumina) and sequencing on a HiSeq 2000 (Illumina) in a single-read 50-cycle run mode (SR50). CNVs from liver metastases and matching primary CRCs were obtained from publicly available data52. Distances between primary and metastasis copy number profiles were calculated by taking the mean absolute distance between two segmented log2 profiles divided by the standard deviation after correcting for purity and ploidy differences between the samples. This was done for a range of values for sample purity (0.2 0.21 .. 1) and mean ploidy (1.5 1.51 … 5) for both the primary and metastatic profile and the distance between both profiles was taken as the minimum of all distances across the searching grid. For patients with multiple primary or metastatic samples the mean of all pairwise comparisons was taken.

Single-cell karyotyping

Single-cell karyotype sequencing of matching primary and peritoneal metastasis samples from colorectal cancer (CRC) patients was performed as described previously66. In short nuclei were isolated from lysed fresh frozen tumor tissue single nuclei were sorted and genomic DNA was fragmented and barcoded. Libraries were prepared as described previously and sequenced on an Illumina Nextseq 500 with 1 × 75-bp single-end sequencing. Sequencing reads were aligned to genome build ‘GRCh38.p10’ with bwa (v0.7.12). Quality control was performed with Aneufinder v1.14 with default parameters.

Gene expression analysis (R2 platform)

To perform differential gene expression analysis on CRC cell lines we made use of a publicly available dataset67 (Sanger GSE36133). To analyze gene expression in CRC patients we made use of the following RNA-seq datasets: AMC-AJCCII-90 cohort26 (GSE33113) MATCH cohort68 (EGAS00001002197) TCGA primary colon cancer (COAD) dataset29 (http://gdac.broadinstitute.org/) and the Guinney dataset22 including 3232 colorectal cancer patients (available at: Synapse syn2623706) and GSE50760 for matched CRC and liver metastasis samples69. Gene set enrichment analysis was done using the R2: Genomics Analysis and Visualization Platform (http://r2.amc.nl) website.

Cell culture

Cell lines T84 SW48 HT55 SW948 LS180 HUTU80 SW620 and OUMS-23 were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 medium with L-glutamine 15 mM HEPES (Thermo-Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies) penicillin and streptomycin. Cell lines HCT116 KM12 LS411N SNU-C1 LS513 MDST8 and NCI-H716 were cultured in RPMI 1640 with L-glutamine 25 mM HEPES (Thermo-Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies) penicillin and streptomycin 1% D-glucose solution plus (Sigma-Aldrich) and 100 μM sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies). All cell lines were obtained as a kind gift from the Sanger Institute (Cambridge UK) and authenticated by STR Genotyping and regularly tested for mycoplasma infection. Lentiviral short hairpin RNA constructs against MSN were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Lentiviral overexpression of MSN was obtained by PCR cloning of MSN cDNA derived from pHJ320-MSN (Addgene plasmid # 20671) into the LeGo-iCer2 (Addgene plasmid # 27346) vector.

Cell viability adherence assays and 3D growth

For in vitro proliferation assays 2000 tumor cells/well were seeded in 96-wells plates in 100 µl of medium. At different time points proliferation was measured using the Cell Titer Blue assay (Promega). Fluorescence signal was measured by fluorescence reader (Biotek). To assess the adherence capacity 20000 cells were seeded in 96-wells plates coated with Rat tail collagen I (Corning) in 100 µl of medium. Thirty minutes after seeding the plate was emptied washed with PBS and fresh medium was added. The number of attached cells was measured using the Cell Titer Blue assay (Promega). To assess 3D growth 1000 cells were plated in a drop of Matrigel (Corning) and the well was filled with complete growth medium. Cells were grown for 7 days and colonies were imaged using the EVOS FL auto imaging system (Life).

Animal experiments

All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Experimentation Committee at the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam (AVD118002016493) and conducted in accordance with the national guidelines. Female nude (Hsd:Athymic Nude-Fox1nu) mice (6–12 weeks old) were purchased from Envigo. The mice were housed on a 12 h light-dark cycle at 20–26 °C with 30–70% humidity. Animals were randomly assigned to experimental groups no blinding was performed during these experiments.

Subcutaneous tumor growth

5 × 104 colon cancer cells in medium were mixed at a 1:1 ratio with Matrigel (Corning) and injected subcutaneously into both flanks of female nude (Hsd:Athymic Nude-Fox1nu) mice (6–12 weeks old). Tumor growth was measured twice a week using calipers using the formula 0.5 × length × width × height. Maximum permitted tumor size of 1000 mm3 was not exceeded.

Intraperitoneal tumor growth

1 × 103 tumor cells in medium were mixed at a 1:1 ratio with cold Matrigel (Corning) and injected intraperitoneally in female nude (Hsd:Athymic Nude-Fox1nu) mice (6–12 weeks old) as also described previously36. Ten weeks after injection mice were sacrificed and the peritoneum was analyzed for the presence of tumor lesions.

Immunofluorescent imaging

Immediately after isolation tumors from in vivo models were fixed using 4%-paraformaldehyde followed by 30% sucrose saturation after which tumors were frozen and 20-µm-thick sections were used for stainings.

For in vitro immunofluorescent imaging cells growing on glass coverslips were fixed using 4%-paraformaldehyde and permeabilized using 1% Triton X100. Tissue sections or fixed cells were incubated with the indicated primary antibody for 3 h followed by incubation with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies for 1 h mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and imaged using an SP8-X confocal microscope (Leica) and the Leica Application Suite-Advanced Fluorescence software. To detect nuclei sections were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) (405 nm laser) for F-Actin detection ActinGreen-488 (phalloidin) ready probe (ThermoFisher 1:1000) (488 nm laser) was used. For HE stainings frozen tumor sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-MSN (HPA011135 Sigma 1:100). As secondary antibody goat-anti-rabbit-Alexa546 (A11035 Invitrogen 1:500) was used.

cDNA synthesis and quantitative RT-PCR

RNA from cell lines was isolated using the Nucleospin RNA isolation kit (Macherey-Nagel). 1 μg of RNA was used to synthesize cDNA using SuperScript III according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed with LC480 SYBR green (Roche) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions on a LC480. Used primers were:

GAPDH:

Fw: 5′-CCAGCAAGAGCACAAGAGGAAGAG-3′

By Shilpa Tiku

The U.S. perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) analytical instrumentation market is expected to generate profound growth over the next 7 years. Verify Markets estimates that the market will likely grow over 20% compound annual rate over that span. The current slope of the U.S. PFAS analytical instrumentation market advancement is steep due to U.S. EPA plans to propose water and wastewater regulations for PFAS. Additionally some of the key drivers include an increased awareness about the widespread prevalence of PFAS contamination public outrage funding and litigation scares.

States are increasingly taking action and developing limits. So once PFAS is discovered and determined to be in concentrations that can likely be harmful to human health each individual state will likely implement more stringent limits. This will have a larger economic effect and higher market revenue.

Product Trends

The top three priorities for a customer seeking PFAS analytical instruments are ease of use after sales service and low cost of ownership. Emerging products also provide a variety of advantages to end users which include elimination of extensive and tedious manual handling steps that are known sources of error high data recovery improved reproducibility high sample throughput and reduced exposure of lab staff to hazardous environments.

End-User Trends

Currently the demand for PFAS analytical instrumentation from industrial facilities is mainly driven by the need to control the quality of the internal processes and not from the perspective to meet PFAS regulations. For instance their primary focus is likely to protect a catalyst or maintain the quality of some process.

Most of the utilities send samples for PFAS measurement to commercial testing laboratories because they cannot afford the high capex involved in buying analytical instruments for PFAS. Demand is driven by large wastewater treatment utilities that are predominantly located in areas having industrial waste containing PFAS.

Demand for PFAS analytical instrumentation from regulatory bodies is driven by the need to support ongoing research to help bolster PFAS regulation. Once the regulation is in place utilities for wastewater and drinking water are likely to drive market growth. Utilities are likely to be either the primary driver of the market or they will be on par with private/commercial testing laboratories. Over the next 5-6 years demand from academic research laboratories is likely saturate and the market share of industrial facilities is likely to increase quickly. The focus should increase on industrial pre-treatment and more process control measures will likely be incorporated to minimize or eliminate PFAS discharge.

According to a key industry participant “PFAS measuring instruments are very expensive and there are a lot of utilities that are not willing to invest that much money in the equipment. So a lot of the utilities are likely going to outsource that measurement to commercial testing labs. In addition to utilities there are a bunch of manufacturers that are also worried about being fined from a litigation perspective. It’s unlikely that they will hire highly specialized and trained chemists for PFAS analysis and then go spend half a million dollars on the instrument to do the analysis; these industrial facilities are also going to outsource their measurements. The private labs are likely to get business from both small utilities and industrial customers that are going to be measuring these things. Due to this reason commercial testing laboratories will continue to make up a substantial component of the market share by end users. Once the PFAS regulations are fully launched and everybody knows exactly what they are supposed to go after and what the consequences are the demand for PFAS measuring instruments from municipalities and water treatment facilities will go up without a doubt.”

Key Players In The Market

The market is still emerging and is very nascent. Some of the key market participants include Agilent Technologies Inc. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Shimadzu Corporation and Metrohm AG.

We are proud to share this the second year in a row we’ve received this recognition. The ParityLISTTM recognizes organizations that are creating a culture and conditions in which women can rise through recruiting promotion and compensation practices leadership representation and benefits and policies that collectively help companies achieve gender parity.

“The parity problem is complex–but it’s not insurmountable” said Cathrin Stickney Parity.Org founder and CEO Stickney. “The extraordinary performance of this year’s honorees proves that a genuine commitment and focus coupled with the right tools measures and practices will absolutely move the needle toward fairness.”

Airbnb remains committed to gender equity and parity and making our workplace an inclusive space where everyone can thrive. While this recognition is important it is also a reminder that we must remain steadfast in our commitment in order to continue our progress. Below are some but not all of the policies programs and benefits we’ve implemented to help make Airbnb a place where underrepresented groups including women can thrive and advance:

Setting long-term representation goals: we have committed that by the end of 2025 at every level 50 percent of our global employees who identify in the gender binary will be women.

Each organization within the company has a Diversity and Belonging Plans in place to drive meaningful progress in areas such as growth and development of underrepresented groups including women. Expanding our sponsorship program to help grow and retain underrepresented talent and offering more broadly other growth and development programs such as mentorship.

Prioritizing equal pay for equal work for all: we have conducted a pay equity analysis annually since 2015 to help examine and adjust pay gaps.

Offering US employees 10 weeks of paid parental leave (in addition to 6-12 weeks of paid medical leave for birth parents) and 12 weeks of phased return to work for families which provides a four-day work week for full-time employees. Globally our parental leave programs are comparable. We also offer caregiver leave providing up to 6 weeks of paid time off to care for a family member with a serious health condition. We recently updated our bereavement leave policy to include more time off for loss of pregnancy.

Providing a range of parental and family benefits including a generous fertility adoption and surrogacy policy a range of caregiving benefits and access to family coaching resources.

Offering our employees the choice to work from home or the office based on where they are most productive and what works best for their personal circumstances through our design for employees to Live and Work Anywhere.* We’re hearing from parents that the flexibility this offers as they balance the complexity of work and family life is one of our top benefits.

Growing our inclusive hiring practices including training to help ensure hiring managers have tangible strategies to integrate diversity into hiring. We also implemented inclusive candidate slates in 2017 which we continue to use today.

Expanding the data employees may submit for dimensions of diversity to help us better understand and support our employees. In the US UK and Ireland our employees can voluntarily share if they identify as a parent or caregiver and share their gender identity.

Providing executive sponsorship and support for Women@ our employee resource group for women and their allies.

""Just north of the San Francisco Bay Area I rented a room in a large extremely secluded house. I arrived in the middle of a rainstorm. The house had five bedrooms except my door was locked. There was no internet and spoiled food in the fridge and one entire wall was nothing but huge windows and doors. My room had a door that opened to the inside of the house and doors on the opposite wall that opened up to a metal dog run that spanned three sides of the house. I had my small puppy with me that I carried throughout the house. This upset the large German shepherd that was pacing around outside the house in the dog run. The German shepherd saw my dog and lost its mind and its pacing increased to a full run back and forth. I believed that my dog and I were safe inside my assigned bedroom. All of a sudden the German shepherd burst through the dog run and glass door straight into my bedroom.""

""The shepherd immediately attacked and had my dog by the neck shaking it back and forth. I had to dig my fingers into the German shepherd to get it away from my dog. I opened the other door in my bedroom that led to the inside of the house. I grabbed my dog and threw it on the bed and forced the shepherd in the opposite direction through the other door that led into the rest of the house. The German shepherd paced barked and threw its entire body against the bedroom door trying to get to my dog. I sat on the floor against the bedroom door and examined my dog for bites before I realized that the German shepherd now had full run of the house and I was locked in the bedroom. I had to call 911 to be rescued. They tracked down the property owner in Italy but had a bad English-Italian conversation. The police had to contact animal control to safely corral the German shepherd so that I could get my things and leave. Drove down the road and cried/slept in my car until morning. Airbnb gave me a full refund.""

But Brian Chesky the CEO of the company thinks that's just the beginning.

""We think there are millions more people that could turn to hosting especially during these economic times"" Chesky said in an earnings call with analysts Tuesday. ""Hosting is one of the easiest ways to be able to make money with an asset that you already have. The majority of people get a booking within the first week.""

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

The short-term-rental giant announced what it called its most profitable second quarter ever with $379 million in net income up from a $68 million loss in the second quarter of 2021. Though Airbnb announced a quarterly record of 103 million nights booked analysts said they expected growth to be better.

Chesky said on the call that luring ""the next generation of hosts"" will be the company's top priority in the fall and beyond.

His comments come as domestic vacation-rental listings across platforms reached a record high of 1.5 million in January 2022 according to industry analytics firm AirDNA. With increased competition some hosts have worried about a summer slowdown in bookings and a recent AirDNA report even said that the sky-high occupancy rates of post-lockdown travel might never return.

Occupancy rates nationwide were down 9% in May and 10% in June compared to 2021 levels according to the report.

Chesky also seems to think a potential recession would make hosting — and the extra cash it could bring in — more attractive. He mentioned several times during his remarks that Airbnb got its start in 2008 during the last recession.

""People were worried about being able to pay their bills pay for their homes and their income. And so they turned to hosting"" he said. ""We think a lot of people may turn to hosting once again. So this is a big opportunity for us.""

Chesky said that the company will unveil new features later this year to lure even more new hosts to the platform.

One source of new hosts might be guests who have recently discovered Airbnb he said adding that 36% of new hosts last quarter were prior guests.

Hosts are already grappling with a more crowded field

Earlier this summer hosts were venting about a slowdown in bookings compared to 2021.

""It makes me really nervous"" Pam Reicks a 51-year-old public-school teacher in Phoenix told Insider. She said her cottage in the mountain town of Payson Arizona lost money in May and June and she was concerned about covering her mortgage.

It's not that guests have disappeared. There simply are more bookings than ever to choose from.

Listings nationwide contracted in the early months of the pandemic according to previous reports from AirDNA. About 20% of rooms came offline as owners likely used the spaces themselves or sold their properties Jamie Lane an AirDNA economist told Insider.

When the post-vaccine travel surge hit short-term rental owners who remained active had primed themselves for a wave of bookings — and profits. Now as more hosts jump in owners shouldn't expect those same occupancy rates according to the AirDNA report.

Some hosts have taken that as their cue to jump ship not wanting to compete with the new influx of supply. Rick Carlson a host in Idaho recently told Insider he's taking his four listings offline next month and will pivot to finding long-term tenants.

The regulations will prevent the approval of new vacation rentals in areas that are considered to have an insufficient density of residential housing including parts of the unincorporated communities of Geyserville Glen Ellen Graton and Guerneville.

The board will have latitude going forward to establish limits on vacation rentals in certain areas that have the highest concentration of them such as along the county's coastline and the lower Russian River area.

The ordinance also restricts who can hold a vacation rental permit countywide. Only individual people of trusts can hold only one permit at a time while corporate entities are barred from holding new rental permits according to the county.

""This is not a recent issue"" said Supervisor Susan Gorin who represents the county's first district and noted that her predecessor on the board Valerie Brown worked on similar issues with vacation rentals roughly a decade ago.

""I think as we've moved forward the technology COVID [and] interest in monetizing the livability and visibility of Sonoma Valley in the entire county has overtaken our ability to really get a handle on vacation rentals"" she said. ""So here we are again.""

The updates will not apply to existing vacation rental properties or those who hold valid permits according to the county.

For about two years county officials have been drafting an updated regulatory package for vacation rentals often private residences that are reserved via platforms like Airbnb and Vrbo for periods of 30 days or fewer.

The county first approved regulations on vacation rentals in 2010 and revised them in 2016. In 2020 the board placed a cap on vacation rentals in the first and fifth supervisorial districts which include the cities of Santa Rosa Sebastopol Sonoma and the county's coastline.

That cap according to county planner Gary Helfrich was implemented in response to ""concerns regarding safety conversion of housing stock ... and complaints regarding noise parking (and) trash."" County officials have since worked on the regulatory package supervisors approved Tuesday.

The county has kept a moratorium in place since May on the approval of new vacation rental applications after Permit Sonoma the county's land use and development agency saw a spike in applications after the county Planning Commission voted on March 17 to extend its public hearing on then-potential vacation rental regulations.

Permit Sonoma officials told the board in May that the agency's staff normally receive and process roughly 10 vacation rental applications per month but that average had risen to 50 per month after the mid-March Planning Commission meeting.

At its May 10 meeting the Board of Supervisors approved a temporary moratorium on the approval of permits submitted after March 17 allowing Permit Sonoma officials the ability to catch up to the agency's application backlog and giving the county the time to draft and approve the updated regulatory package.

The board subsequently extended the moratorium in mid-June. On Tuesday the board amended the ongoing moratorium to allow Permit Sonoma to process applications received between March 17 and May 10.

According to county officials the moratorium may remain in place through May 10 2023. If the board chooses to do so the moratorium could be extended an additional year."

DDoS Attacks Intensify Worldwide Amid Geopolitical Unrest

Online attackers converted an Eastern Europe company's online domain into a DDoS frontline through a series of bandwidth-consuming attacks unprecedented in size and scope. Akamai Technologies which detected and halted the attacks says the incident is the largest European distributed denial-of-service attack on record.

See Also: Defining a Detection & Response Strategy

The company isn't revealing the victim. The incident comes amid reports of amped-up DDoS attack global volumes. Akamai rival Cloudflare also recently detected a ""largest attack"" while Ukraine and Russia have each reported intensified DDoS incidents. In Ukraine's case attempts to knock government websites offline began even before the Russian invasion.

DDoS attacks use compromised devices to send malicious network traffic to a targeted server with the intent of overwhelming the target with traffic so it is unable to accept legitimate requests.

Akamai said attackers targeted the Eastern European victim 75 times over 30 days in July. The hackers used well-coordinated global botnets of high-bandwidth IoT devices. The attack traffic peaked at 853.7 gigabits per second or 659.6 million packets per second during a 14-hour period.

Attackers used a number of methods but turned most often to UDP the connectionless and sessionless transport layer protocol. They had global reach and full control of botnets used to launch the spoofed UDP queries says Dean Houari director of security technology and strategy for the Asia-Pacific region at Akamai.

It was unusual to see how the attackers were able to evenly distribute the traffic attack volume across their botnet Houari tells Information Security Media Group. ""These attackers had complete control of how traffic is generated and distributed across the world"" he says.

Escalating Threat

DDoS attacks are becoming more frequent and intensifying in volume.

In April Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky reported DDoS attacks hit an all-time high during the first quarter of 2022 notably due to a spate of attacks on Ukrainian and Russian online resources. Hacking collective Anonymous claimed responsibility for one such attack directed against RT News a Russian state-controlled online propaganda news network.

In June Cloudflare reported that a botnet named Mantis was targeting its customers with ""record-breaking attacks"" of 26 million requests per second. Unlike the usual motley array of hacked internet of things devices used to launch DDoS attacks the Mantis botnet hijacked virtual machines. Hence the botnet's moniker taken from Mantis shrimp which are tiny but forceful creatures.

Omer Yoachimik a product manager at Cloudflare tells ISMG that DDoS attacks tend to be seasonal aligned with geopolitical events around the world. They also correlate to the rise of new botnets.

""While it's hard to say for sure because of the distributed nature of DDoS attacks it may well be tied to events such as the war in Ukraine and additional global events such as elections and even new online game releases"" Yoachimik says.

""In the Ukraine-Russia cyberspace we can see that the war on the ground is accompanied by attacks targeting the spread of information. DDoS attacks target media outlets and publishing companies on both sides of the war to try and stop the spread of information"" Yoachimik says.

The island of Taiwan has also recently experienced a bevy of DDoS attacks timed around the visit of U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi although none have lasted very long and appear to be the work of Chinese hacktivists rather than Beijing-sponsored hackers. One such attack began after Pelosi departed Taiwan and resulted in the website of the Ministry of National Defense going offline for about an hour the ministry says.

Companies should be prepared for DDoS attacks by ensuring that incident response plans are up to date Houari says. He also recommends reviewing the cybersecurity ""Shields Up"" guidance issued by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyZXB1YmxpYy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9jbG91ZC10ZXN0aW5nLXRvb2xzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top cloud automation testing tools for 2022,"With the advantages cloud storage offers over on-premise or traditional storage we will continue to witness more migration of organizational resources to the cloud.

What is a cloud testing tool?

A cloud testing tool offers organizations a form of automated software assessment that utilizes cloud computing resources to test the performance of their software applications. It checks the overall performance of cloud resources to ensure that every element runs efficiently. Cloud testing tools also help organizations to evaluate cloud-based applications for functional and non-functional requirements.

Additionally cloud testing tools are designed to produce a virtual replica of cloud-based resources to test for efficiency in elements such as latency compatibility security and overall infrastructure performance.

Benefits of using cloud testing tools

Low Cost

Testers can attest that the ownership cost of cloud-based testing tools is much lower than that of traditional testing resources. In cloud testing testers can easily reuse the components used in the test environments. In other words you do not need many hardware requirements to conduct cloud-based testing of your cloud resources. These tools also allow testing teams to utilize tools with no-licensing cost.

Virtualization

The use of cloud-based tools brings about the benefits of virtualization. To be more specific businesses have the opportunity to utilize their resources in a way that maximizes effective testing. As applications become more complicated virtualization becomes absolutely necessary.

Continuous access to cloud resources

Cloud testing enables users of cloud-based applications to have uninterrupted access to their applications even during testing. This unbroken access enables them to fulfill consumer needs promptly. Furthermore early in the software development lifecycle testers can spot errors.

Additionally cloud-based environments enable testing teams to effectively have a wider test coverage in a short time because teams can log in to the testing platform wherever they are and begin testing when needed.

Easier disaster recovery

In case of hardware or storage malfunction the backup recovery process for on-premise systems has never been easy due to the additional cost required for recovery upgrades and maintenance. However with the availability of cloud testing software tools organizations can easily recover their valuable information or assets in just a few clicks. This is mainly because the information is also stored on many servers: If one gets bad cloud engineers can easily switch to the other servers to bring back the information.

Facilitates DevOps

DevOps derives its relevance from automation and cloud testing makes enough provision for it. In addition cloud testing enhances DevOps teams in the following ways: Remote monitoring easy deployment reconfigurations and deployment of cloud applications automation of test reporting easy user access to feedback and more. It’s safe to say that cloud testing helps reduce the bottlenecks in cloud monitoring testing and resolution of issues with cloud resources.

Key features of cloud testing tools

Picking the best cloud-based automation testing tools for your DevOps teams can be daunting without knowing some key features to consider. Let’s take a look at some features to consider before making a selection.

It should have dynamic user activities mapping

Ensure that the tool you pick can document upload edit and maintain user activities right inside the testing tool. This feature will help your team have comprehensive information on who changed what and why.

Cross-browser and cross-device automation

If you’re ready to pick a cloud testing tool for your organization check to be sure that the tool can automate testing across different devices. Your product users use your software products on different devices. Hence your testing tool should be able to test for performance across different devices.

There should be a central knowledge repository

Check to find out if your preferred cloud tool can store results and information in a central repository. This is important as this central repository will function as the single source of truth to any information sought. Having a tool that stores information in a central repository also ensures that vital information is not duplicated into several versions using other storage devices.

As the world of customer service becomes more complex and “omnichannel” teams need an aligned environment for accessing valuable information and tracking support tickets.

Helpdesks bring everything your employees need to deliver exceptional service together in one easy-to-use environment. The right tools can make it easier to track customer conversations across platforms from SMS to social media. They also provide knowledgebase articles self-service tools automations and bots to boost agent efficiency.

The question is how do you choose a helpdesk vendor you can trust in 2022? As demand for helpdesk technology increases the available options on the market are evolving too. Here are some quick steps to help you choose the right vendor this year.

Step 1: Understand Your Audience

First things first you’re going to need to determine who you’re going to be serving with your helpdesk technology. The first fundamental audience you’re going to be looking at is your employees. Helpdesk environments are primarily intended to make life easier for your team members so they can manage customer service requests more effectively.

With this in mind think about how your team members are likely to be using your helpdesk tools. Which platforms do they need to align in a unified inbox to track customer conversations (SMS email voice etc)? What kind of resources will they need to have available within the helpdesk to ensure they can deliver the right service such as knowledgebase articles and bots?

You may even want to look into tools to help your employees remain as productive as possible when working in a remote or hybrid environment. Troubleshooting tools and service desk technology built into the helpdesk can make it easier for team members to solve technology problems without IT help.

If you’re going to be serving an audience of B2B customers there’s a good chance you’ll need to think about installing a customer service portal too. This is a portal within your helpdesk where users can submit and track ticket requests access self-service features and even check FAQ articles.

Step 2: Align with Your Existing CX Technology

After you know who you’re serving with your helpdesk solution and what they’re likely to need the next step is making sure everything can align with your existing CX tools. A helpdesk is just one component of a comprehensive service strategy. If you want to be able to align all of your customer data and service requests in one place you’re going to need your desk to integrate with your CCaaS ecosystem. Make sure you can collect data from all the contact centre tools you use.

Since helpdesks are also a source of useful information for employees and customers alike it’s worth ensuring you can link other applications and tools into the environment too. You may want to connect your helpdesk to your ERP system or implement stock tracking tools so you can give your customers an update on their order in seconds.

One of the most common tools to connect with your helpdesk technology is a CRM (customer relationship management) platform. This will give your agents a complete view into your customers and their previous purchases. The more information your agents have about each client the more they can personalise and contextualise the support strategy.

Step 3: Explore Feature Sets

Once you know your vendor can align your tools with your existing strategy for customer service the next step is examining the available features on offer. Most helpdesks will come with a handful of consistent features like omnichannel inbox alignment so you can track a customer conversation and service request across multiple platforms and stages.

However as helpdesk solutions become more advanced we’re also seeing an increase in the number of additional tools offered to make teams more efficient. You might want to consider:

Workflow automation: Workflow automation tools allow you to easily automate repetitive manual actions to make your teams more efficient. This can reduce the amount of administrative work your agents need to do each day.

Workflow automation tools allow you to easily automate repetitive manual actions to make your teams more efficient. This can reduce the amount of administrative work your agents need to do each day. Self-service: Self-service solutions like knowledgebase builders AI bots and FAQs can support both agents and customers alike. You can offer these tools to customers who want to solve their own issues or use them to guide employees.

Self-service solutions like knowledgebase builders AI bots and FAQs can support both agents and customers alike. You can offer these tools to customers who want to solve their own issues or use them to guide employees. Artificial Intelligence: Many vendors are offering AI solutions as part of the helpdesk landscape today. These tools can help with proactively triaging tickets analysing customer sentiment and spotting anomalies in ticket traffic.

Other potential features you might want to consider include built-in CRM technology calling tools and even collaboration features to keep your hybrid workers synchronised.

Step 4: Look for Flexibility

Every company and customer base is different. As you learn more about your audience the way you manage service requests as a team and your workforce you may need to adapt your helpdesk accordingly. A flexible vendor will allow you to embed new integrations or use API connections to link different tools together for productivity purposes.

Flexibility in a vendor also means you can deliver more options to your agents for how they view and manage support requests. For instance a leading helpdesk tool might allow you to set up automatic routing strategies to send tickets to specific agents based on priority. You can even allow your agents to customise their own dashboards and to-do lists with certain tools.

A flexible solution will allow you to adapt your helpdesk to suit the specific needs of your employees even if you’re shifting into a new mode of work like hybrid or remote working. It should also ensure you can embed more intelligent and innovative tools as your company grows. For instance you might use your helpdesk to build a powerful chatbot for customer service in the future.

Step 5: Remember Security

Finally any great helpdesk vendor should be able to offer you exceptional peace of mind. A helpdesk deals with huge amounts of business and customer data on a regular basis. This is excellent for providing you with insights into your audience and team. However it also means you need to be cautious about how data is managed and stored.

Ensure your helpdesk vendor can give you complete control over how people access data in your helpdesk and where that information is stored for compliance purposes. It’s also worth looking for a vendor that adheres to the latest guidelines and regulations in your industry.

If you have specific concerns about things like data sovereignty you can always contact your vendor to discuss the way data is managed in the helpdesk and what you can control.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbnRhbC10cmlidW5lLmNvbS9jL2V4b2NhZC9uZXdzL2V4b2NhZC1pbnRyb2R1Y2VzLWRlbnRhbGNhZC0zLTEtcmlqZWthLXNvZnR3YXJlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dental News - Exocad introduces DentalCAD 3.1 Rijeka software,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.dental-tribune.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /c/exocad/news/exocad-introduces-dentalcad-3-1-rijeka-software/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D82E3DC60>, 'Connection to www.dental-tribune.com timed out.

Live and broadcast audio comms ride on a Dante network

Story Highlights

Known informally as the “Woodstock of fitness” the CrossFit Games might owe more to X Games and its multisite operation across a huge campus than that quaintly one-stage ur-music festival. The 2022 NOBULL CrossFit Games run Aug. 3-7 at Madison WI’s Alliant Energy Center where they have been since 2017 crowning “the Fittest Man and Fittest Woman on Earth.” The complex venue comprises an exhibition center vendor pavilions a sponsors row a beer garden and an outdoor competition area North Park Stadium built specifically for the Games. As physically spread out as the CrossFit Games have become though their digital-audio footprint is apparently smaller this year.

Hearcorp Principal Dave Bjornson a 10-year veteran of the Games as an A2 and A1 serves as audio supervisor and teamed with Justin Gordon lead at sound-reinforcement provider Creative Technologies and CP Communications Senior RF Tech Manager Frank Rafka to create a single Dante-over-MADI IP network for the entire event’s audio needs including live sound and comms.

“Historically” says Bjornson “broadcast audio sound reinforcement and intercoms on this event have been distinct groups living in their own worlds. It wasn’t very efficient and it didn’t always produce the highest-quality end product. This year I approached [CrossFit Senior Coordinating Producer] Joe Novello and [CrossFit event producer Hamilton Road Productions] Principal Charlie Dube about the idea of sharing all of the event’s audio over a large Dante IP network.”

On the network are eight Yamaha live-sound consoles mixing L-Acoustics PA systems at each venue all connected through Dante. NEP SS8 and SS4 mobile units handle the event-long outbound streaming for CrossFit International program global feeds as well as the two-hours broadcast via CBS Sports on Finals Sunday. The result says Bjornson is that most audio content will be available from and to every location in real time. For instance racks of Shure Axient wireless microphones that had been intended for specific venues on the campus are now available for any location and for either live-sound or broadcast uses.

Sound for Secret Events

That capability is particularly important for the CrossFit Games where some of the events are kept secret until hours or even minutes before they’re to be played. In some cases such as last-minute climbing-wall competitions the only audio assets on hand may be installed crowd microphones and wireless-camera mics. In that case says Bjornson wireless lavalier and Hearcorp’s custom contact microphones may be quickly paired with CP’s Axient transmitters in local racks and deployed as effects microphones attached to a nearby wall or beam.

“A camera microphone can get it started” he says “but once an athlete is 20 ft. in the air you’ve got nothing. Being able to throw a lav up on the wall on short notice makes all the difference. And that same microphone can go to the live sound and the broadcast.”

A campus-wide Riedel Bolero intercom system is deployed around the various venues and is also extended to outside events via a Unity IP-based intercom with 48 drops across all venues. Unity Connect from the pool at the Nicholas Rec Center encompasses both talent and effects mics and talent IFBs.

“Everyone has a Bolero beltpack and those can access either the Riedel or the Unity intercoms with the press of a button” says Bjornson whose Hearcorp also operates Tech 25 an after-school education non-profit that has introduced and taught the basics of live-event technology to nearly three dozen teens and preteens in Pittsburgh’s Carrick neighborhood. The comms crew includes Alejandro Olivares who handles Bolero/Riedel programming; Tim Kepner who does the Adam programming; and Andy Strauber who is responsible for trunking the intercom systems of the two trucks together enabling the programming of both trucks from a single location.

Bonded Cellular

Rafka sees the CrossFit Games as a good platform for CP’s extensive foray into cellular-bonding technology which allows two or more cellular modems to be combined in a way that enables the end user to utilize the combined bandwidth. Cellular bonding transmits live streams via multiplexed cellular signals when Ethernet or Wi-Fi isn’t available. Instead of satellite transmissions multiple cellular modems are deployed to combine 3G 4G LTE and other cellular signals to boost connectivity.

CP’s complement for this year’s Games includes seven conventional microwave cameras with full Paint control across all venues one bonded-cell camera with full Paint control across all venues and 11 bonded-cellular cameras across the Outside Events Group competitions happening at the Capitol Building and at the pool at the Nicholas Rec Center. All have full Paint control and video return and use both Mobile Viewpoint and AVIWEST bonded devices.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy53aXNjLmVkdS9kYXktMi1jaGFuY2VsbG9yLW1ub29raW4tZ29lcy1mcm9tLWNhbXB1cy10by1jb21tdW5pdHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Day 2: Chancellor Mnookin connects campus and community,"After a whirlwind first day that included meetings with dozens of students faculty staff and shared governance leaders — not to mention a giant ice cream party for the entire community — Chancellor Jennifer L. Mnookin turned her focus toward UW–Madison’s partnerships with the Madison and Dane County communities.

View photos from the ice cream social and her day one visits.

Her plans for day two include opportunities to meet with local state and tribal officials; a visit to one of Dane County’s most important community organizations the United Way of Dane County; followed by lunch with Zach Brandon of the Greater Madison Chamber of Commerce and local CEOs.

To close her first 48 hours Mnookin is touring two vital hubs for the community: the South Madison Partnership home of UW’s Community Relations and the Odyssey Program and the Urban League of Greater Madison.

Throughout her initial meetings Mnookin has reiterated her desire to learn everything she can while following the vision of the Wisconsin Idea.

“In my first few months as chancellor my focus will be on listening and learning in order to understand more deeply our greatest opportunities as well as our challenges” she says.

To see what else Chancellor Mnookin is up to follow her on Twitter and Instagram.

3 P.M. Aug. 5

Operating in partnership with the community

Chancellor Mnookin walked across the parking lot from UW South Madison Partnership to visit Ruben Anthony and the Urban League of Greater Madison. There she learned more about the challenges and opportunities faced by Madison’s South Side and Dane County’s Black residents.

For instance Anthony shared that though 46 percent of Black Americans across the nation own homes that’s true of just 10 percent of Dane County’s Black residents. And of 10000 businesses in Dane County with more than one employee only 40 are run by Black business owners.

Urban League is working to change that and Anthony president and CEO shared with Mnookin efforts to create the Black Business Hub — a physical space and programming intended to address the disparities between Dane County residents and access to entrepreneurship and wealth from building financial literacy to offering grant funding and loans.

The Black Business Hub will serve as the entryway into the city from the South Side Anthony said. “The road to the university from South Madison is going to look a lot different.”

And there’s a role for the university he told Mnookin including leveraging the university’s resources including through academic programs and expertise.

“I look forward to partnership and calling upon you for counsel” Mnookin told him.

2 P.M. Aug. 5

At South Madison Partnership Chancellor Mnookin found alchemy

Located less than three miles from campus UW South Madison Partnership serves as a gateway between campus and Madison’s vibrant South Side neighborhood. Chancellor Mnookin visited SMP to meet with community relations director Brenda Gonzalez South Side community members UW–Madison student interns for the Literacy Network as well as staff and graduates from the UW Odyssey Project.

Among those graduates was Char Braxton who now works for Odyssey while pursuing degrees in Chinese and creative writing. With overwhelming emotion she read a poem about her educational journey that started with a high school counselor telling her she was not “college material.” She paused; others in the room dabbed tears from their eyes.

“As we think about the impact and lives that have been changed (by education) it’s our responsibility as a public university to make change in all the ways we can but sometimes it takes alchemy” Mnookin said “It’s clear that alchemy is here.”

Founded by UW–Madison’s Emily Auerbach the Odyssey Project offers low-income adults access to education. The program has more than 500 alumni many of whom have — often despite lives affected by homelessness incarceration and substance abuse — gone on to earn bachelor’s and master’s degrees.

Odyssey uses instruction in the humanities to empower people to find their voice increase their confidence create pathways to further educational opportunities and break the cycle of generational poverty.

That’s been the case for Keena Atkinson a 2010 Odyssey graduate who went on to earn her bachelor’s degree in psychology from UW–Madison in 2015. When she started with Odyssey she was sleeping next to a heater on a mattress in her friend’s barbershop. Now her 18-year-old son is headed to his freshman year at UW-Whitewater.

“What you shared was extraordinary. You are extraordinary.” Chancellor Mnookin said. “And this is a space that helped you find your own strengths. To be able to live them is an incredible thing and exactly what we should be doing as a public university.”

Noon Aug. 5

Building a strong economic future with Wisconsin business leaders

Chancellor Mnookin met with several business leaders for lunch at Cooper’s Tavern located on the Capitol Square in downtown Madison to discuss UW–Madison’s continuing work to provide education to develop the state’s workforce along with research and resources to Wisconsin businesses. From the University Research Park’s support of growing businesses to the Office of Business Engagement’s partnerships UW–Madison helps build a strong state economy.

10 a.m. Aug. 5

Planning a better education for all with the United Way

As part of the day’s community outreach Chancellor Mnookin met with Renee Moe CEO of the United Way of Dane County to discuss ways that UW–Madison and the United Way can work together. Making sure that all children have access to a good education is a key part of the United Way’s mission and is also a priority for the university. In 2021 The United Way of Dane County raised more than $18 million to support over 850 nonprofit organizations.

UW–Madison has regularly collaborated with United Way of Dane County throughout the years. In 2016 the organization was awarded a Community Opportunity Grant for the Smart Meds Program aimed at improving health outcomes for vulnerable adults. More recently the university partnered with The United Way of Dane County on DreamUp Wisconsin a community-university collaboration that works to promote shared prosperity and increase American competitiveness.

Francesca Hong Madison Common Council President Keith Furman Dane County Board Chair Patrick Miles and other local and state elected officials. Also in the conversation were UW–Madison Tribal Relations Director Aaron Bird Bear and representatives from the Ho-Chunk Nation.

“They were a very loving couple” said the Muellers’ niece Michelle McNett of Janesville. “They were very very family oriented. I think everyone’s just in shock right now and kind of request privacy.”

She said the couple had five children plus 10 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

McNett said Donna 75 was a teacher and in her retirement worked at the Comfort Shoppe a local furniture store. Jim 76 was a retired contractor who had his own drywall business.

She said she’s not sure why they picked the nation’s capital for their vacation but added “Donna was a constant learner.”

The couple had planned to go to Mount Vernon George and Martha Washington’s historic home 13 miles south of Washington on Friday.

The couple were high school sweethearts who grew up in Cuba City 65 miles southwest of Madison and graduated from Cuba City High School McNett said. They moved to Janesville when Jim got a job there.

They are survived by a daughter Michelle Brookfield; and sons Maurie Oregon Wisconsin; Mark Janesville; Matt Columbus Ohio; and Mitch Texas.

McNett said the couple loved having gatherings and just had a big family gathering a couple of weeks ago.

“They were very religious” she said. “Just the kind of people who would give the shirt off their back to do anything for you both of them.”

The Muellers died of their injuries after the lightning strike in Lafayette Park across the street from the White House the Metropolitan Police Department said.

Two other people a man and a woman also were struck and were in critical condition Thursday the police department said. Their identities were not immediately released.

“We are saddened by the tragic loss of life after the lightning strike in Lafayette Park” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. “Our hearts are with the families who lost loved ones and we are praying for those still fighting for their lives.”

A severe thunderstorm hit the D.C. region around 7 p.m. Thursday.

The victims were riding out the storm under a tree according to a law enforcement source CNN reported.

Key Takeaways

Entrepreneurs often do not know the appropriate amount of capital to raise at each stage of their business life cycle. It’s important that they understand the timeline for capital deployment and what milestones each tranche of capital will allow them to achieve. Most panelists agreed that their funds invest in tranches based upon the achievement of milestones rather than investing all the capital at once.

Before making an investment each venture capital (“VC”) firm spends considerable time evaluating the start-up’s financial model. The key metrics they focus on are revenue growth customer acquisition cost lifetime value of a customer cashflow breakeven and recurring revenues.

VCs certainly like it when a founder has a business plan but most VCs prefer not to read through voluminous business plans at the outset of interactions with a company seeking funding. Most venture investors prefer pitch decks because they force the founder and/or management team to be both concise. For an initial meeting with a VC the shorter and more focused the pitch the better.

VCs can spend a lot of time evaluating the founder and members of the management team. They are looking for a founder and management team who are coachable. Coachability really means being both able and willing to take advice and criticism from others. While most VCs prioritize investing in “the jockey and not the horse” the optimal investment prospect features both.

VCs always like personal introductions to a founder from a respected source—lawyers accountants bankers or other professionals—with whom they work on a regular basis. VCs would usually not advise a founder to hire an investment banker to help them source capital particularly if it is an early-stage company. Instead founders should be entrepreneurial enough to find introductions to potential investors without having to retain the services of a banker and pay investment banking fees.

A single VC may see several hundred deals annually yet makes only a few investments. VCs are generally looking for companies that are disruptive solve big problems and sell into very large viable markets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5leHR0di5jb20vbmV3cy9zcGFuaXNoLWxhbmd1YWdlLXByb2dyYW1taW5nLXNwb3J0cy1ncmV3LWFkLWltcHJlc3Npb25zLWluLWZpcnN0LWhhbGYtb2YtMjAyMi1pc3BvdHR20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Spanish-Language Programming Sports Grew Ad Impressions in First Half of 2022: iSpot.tv,"Liberty Mutual was the top advertiser in the first half of 2022

Companies from Google parent Alphabet Inc. to General Motors Co. to PepsiCo Inc. are among those that have increased spending on big-ticket items such as real estate equipment or technology to fuel growth. The investments are generally intended to expand the companies’ fast-growing operations or even optimize their inventory in the midst of a challenging business environment according to executives.

Capital expenditures among companies in the S&P 500 have been growing at a faster pace than stock repurchases for the first time since the first quarter of 2021 according to data analyzed by S&P Dow Jones Indices from the second-quarter earnings season.

Based on results from roughly two-thirds of the companies in the index capital expenditures have risen 20% from a year earlier to $149.8 billion roughly in line with the first quarter’s growth rate. Meanwhile share repurchases have climbed 10% to $160.8 billion and dividends have increased 14% to $140.6 billion.

The spending boom has offered a leg of support to a stock market that has been buffeted by worries about soaring inflation and the pace of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates. The S&P 500 has slumped 13% this year but has rebounded 13% from its low in mid-June.

“One reason that stocks haven’t absolutely fallen off a cliff right now is because of that increased capex"" said Ben Silverman director of research at investment research firm VerityData. “There’s signaling from the executive suite that they’re comfortable spending money instead of hoarding cash.""

The latest round of corporate earnings reports have offered conflicting views about the economy’s trajectory and whether a recession is on the horizon. Inflationary pressures have driven up the costs of everything from food to fuel and raw materials weighing on corporate profits and weakening consumers’ buying power.

Investors continue to parse mixed data about the health of the economy. Gross domestic product has contracted for two straight quarters a common definition of a recession. Still job gains remain strong and the unemployment rate is holding steady. Investors are awaiting the latest reading on the labor market with July’s jobs report due Friday.

Meanwhile Wall Street sentiment hit its lowest level in more than five years in July according to Bank of America’s latest reading of sell-side strategists released this week. Extreme bearish sentiment is often a contrarian signal for a potential rally the bank’s analysts said.

Companies in the information-technology communications-services and industrials sectors have been the biggest contributors to capital-expenditure growth according to a Bank of America analysis.

Alphabet for one reported last week that its second-quarter capital spending rose to $6.8 billion up from $5.5 billion a year prior. The company said it is spending on technical infrastructure particularly servers.

“With an uncertain global economic outlook our strategy to invest in deep technology and computer science to build helpful products for the long term is the right one"" Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said on the company’s earnings call.

Likewise GM’s capital spending climbed to $2.1 billion in the second quarter from $1.5 billion in the same period a year before. Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson on GM’s earnings call highlighted the auto maker’s push to expand its electric-vehicle fleet. “The investments we have made in these vehicles over the last couple of years…provide a strong bridge to our all-electric future"" he said.

PepsiCo finance chief Hugh Johnston pointed to digital investments to ensure stores are stocked with appropriate inventory as the beverage and snack company reported $1.5 billion in capital spending in the 24 weeks ended in mid-June up from $1.3 billion during that period a year prior.

“If we have a series of earnings here where capital expenditures continue to be quite strong and companies are willing to spend that capital that means they’re giving a pretty optimistic outlook for their business"" said Victoria Fernandez chief market strategist and portfolio manager at Crossmark Global Investments.

Some of the growth in capital spending can be attributed to a restart in typical behavior after companies chose to stockpile cash during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Companies in the S&P 500 held about $1.667 trillion in cash and equivalents on their balance sheets at the end of the first quarter down from $1.797 trillion at the end of 2021 according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. That figure excludes the financials real estate utilities and transportation sectors because those companies normally maintain high cash reserves.

Other companies are spending to bring production to the U.S. to stem persistent supply- chain challenges that have led to shipping delays and shortages of key products such as semiconductors. Mentions of “reshoring"" during earnings conference calls have skyrocketed in 2022 according to Bank of America.

“That’s going to be a longer-term theme that reflects the reality that there’s a compelling opportunity to…manufacture and build in America"" said Rajesh Nakadi head of investments at BNY Mellon Wealth Management Global Family Office.

Some companies are tightening their belts as they brace for a potential recession. Intel Corp. for example last week cut its capital spending forecast for the year. The chip maker reported a surprise quarterly loss and its biggest revenue decline in more than a decade blaming a slump in personal-computer purchases and product delays.

Labor challenges have sparked an increase in investments in automation technology according to investors and analysts.

Companies are still keeping plenty of cash on the sidelines signaling some restraint in capital spending according to Howard Silverblatt senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.

“Is it a record?"" asked Mr. Silverblatt of capital expenditures. “No but they are good numbers. It’s definitely an up quarter despite concerns.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZW56aW5nYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMi8wOC8yODM1OTQwOC9kb25hbGQtdHJ1bXBzLXRob3VnaHRzLWFuZC1vcGluaW9ucy13aWxsLXNvb24tYmUtYXZhaWxhYmxlLXRvLW1vcmUtcGVvcGxlLWhvdy1hbmRyb2lkLXVzZXJzLWNhbi1nZXTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Donald Trump's Opinions Will Soon Be Available To Android Users: How To Get Truth Social,"Social media platform Truth Social is one of the few places left for former President Donald Trump to share his thoughts and opinions.

Here’s a look at how the company could soon be expanding its reach.

What Happened: The social media platform Truth Social announced Wednesday it is now available for pre-order in the Google Play Store. Those who have phones tablets and other devices that operate on the Android operating system a unit of Alphabet Inc. GOOGGOOGL will be able to pre-order the app here.

“Trump Media & Technology Group announced today that an Android App for its free-speech social media platform Truth Social is now available for U.S. based users to pre-order in the Google Play Store” a press release reads.

Trump Media & Technology Group announced a SPAC merger with Digital World Acquisition Corp DWAC in 2021.

Why It’s Important: In the aftermath of the Jan 6. riot on the U.S. Capitol social media companies — Twitter Inc. TWTR and Meta Platforms Inc. META — banned Trump’s accounts on their platforms citing a violation of their policies.

Google-owned YouTube also banned Trump. As a result he has a limited number of places where he can share his thoughts and opinions with the public.

Truth Social saw strong success out of the gates when it was publicly released on the iOS store from Apple Inc AAPL.

Tesla Inc. TSLA CEO Elon Musk even pointed to Truth Social downloads topping Twitter earlier this year.

However downloads of Truth Social fell sharply after the first week it was available on iOS Benzinga reported. Technology issues and a long waiting list of people unable to get into the app could be reasons why some gave up on the platform early.

After not posting on Truth Social for months Trump put out a ""Truth"" in April stating “I’M BACK” which led to a spike in Digital World Acquisition shares.

Truth Social has attracted usage by those banned from other social media platforms including Twitter and YouTube. The platform has other politicians on it and could become an increasingly large network ahead of the election season with Trump exploring a potential run for president in the 2024 election.

A Twitter buyout by Musk could lead to a more open approach and fewer user bans which could hurt Truth Social in the future. Musk said he would unban Trump but the former president said he wouldn't return.

Trump could still maintain ownership of the company if he runs for public office according to a filing for the SPAC merger.

“The company’s principal ownership and position in the company shall be structured in such a way as to eliminate the need for restructuring of ownership or changes in position were a material disruptive event to occur” the filing said.

The filing listed running for public office or being convicted of a felony criminal offense as material disruptive event examples.

Digital World Acquisition was the top performing IPO of 2021 and saw shares hit $175 last year.

Shares of the SPAC have fallen in 2022 with calls that the SPAC merger will not be approved.

Truth Social could see an improvement in its user figures with the addition of Android something that could make shares volatile once again.

Tobacco stocks are a longtime favorite of dividend investors and sister companies Altria Group (MO 0.95%) and Philip Morris International (PM 1.23%) dominate the industry.

Since Altria spun off Philip Morris more than a decade ago the two companies have taken different approaches to ready their companies for a future where cigarettes aren't their main revenue source. Both companies have their advantages but one is likely to outperform the other. Here is how these two dividend stalwarts stack up.

Both companies put cash in your pockets

Altria sells tobacco and nicotine products in the United States headlined by the Marlboro brand of cigarettes. Philip Morris also sells Marlboro but exclusively in non-U.S. markets. Marlboro is the leading cigarette brand in America and while it has more competition internationally it contributed 37% of Philip Morris' shipment volumes in 2020.

Warren Buffett (who doesn't own or advocate owning either stock) once described cigarettes as something that cost a penny to make sell for a dollar and are addictive. In other words Altria and Philip Morris enjoy substantial profit margins routinely getting $0.39 and $0.35 respectively of free cash flow from each revenue dollar.

The addictive nature of nicotine has made tobacco companies resilient through up and down markets and economies. Altria is a Dividend King with 52 consecutive dividend raises. Meanwhile Philip Morris has raised its payout yearly as a public company.

You can see how each dividend compares in the chart below:

Altria's 8.2% dividend yield is excellent but Philip Morris isn't slouching either. You can do great with Altria for income but the dividend payout ratio for Philip Morris is notably lower which leaves more room for the payout's long-term growth.

Going beyond smoking

The public has known that cigarettes are a health hazard since the Surgeon General's first public warning in 1964 (and many knew it even before then). The dividends have flowed for decades despite this but the smoking rate is steadily decreasing and tobacco companies ship fewer cigarettes each year.

There is a common goal for Altria and Philip Morris to build a sustainable business beyond cigarettes but they've taken two different paths to get there. Philip Morris has spent nearly the past decade growing its IQOS brand a heat-not-burn tobacco device that produces inhalable vapor with fewer toxins than regular cigarette smoke. IQOS now contributes 30% of the company's total revenue.

Altria's tried buying assets to diversify beyond smokeable products but hasn't had much luck. It has majority ownership of on! nicotine pouches which have steadily grown in recent years. Altria's 2018 $12.8 billion investment into electronic cigarette maker Juul has already become one of the biggest mistakes in corporate history. A recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ruling has prohibited the sale of Juul in the States which all but makes Altria's investment worthless.

Altria and Philip Morris still rely heavily on smokeable products and they have a long way to go before they can financially stand on their own without tobacco sales. Still Altria seemingly has more questions about its long-term future than Philip Morris at the moment.

Looking at valuation

Wall Street has placed very different valuations on Altria and Philip Morris for as similar as they are. Philip Morris has a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of almost 17.6 while Altria's is just 9.1 nearly 50% lower. Naturally investors want to know if this is justified. It's a tricky question to answer; the companies have similar growth expectations. Analysts believe the companies will grow earnings per share (EPS) by annual averages of 4% (Altria) and 4.5% (Philip Morris) over the next three to five years.

Altria is in Wall Street's dog house for its mistakes in the Juul acquisition. Understandably spending $12.8 billion on something and declaring it nearly worthless less than four years later is not ideal. But the stock's been punished and then some; meanwhile Altria's legacy business continues carrying water for shareholders.

Which stock is worth further consideration?

If you're looking for the total package where both dividends and share price are important to you Philip Morris International has a slight edge. The company's IQOS brand was built within Philip Morris and has enormous potential.

Altria's colossal dividend and dirt cheap valuation could mean it is the better stock in the short term.

Wilson became the national chair of the Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA) in May 2021 and in June 2022 coasted to an easy primary victory for his fourth term as AG—thanks to a 30-to-1 fundraising advantage over challenger Lauren Martel.

The Democrats did not field a candidate.

Every year RAGA accepts millions in unlimited contributions from corporations individuals and special interest groups—including Koch Industries Altria and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce— to fund the campaigns of Republican candidates for attorneys general and coordinate the official actions of Republican AGs.

Together with its affiliates the Rule of Law Defense Fund (RLDF) a 501(c)(4) and the Center for Law and Policy a 501(c)(3) RAGA runs a cash-for-influence operation that sells its corporate funders access to those AGs and their staff.

RAGA AGs are “the object of aggressive pursuit by lobbyists and lawyers who use campaign contributions personal appeals at lavish corporate-sponsored conferences and other means to push them to drop investigations change policies negotiate favorable settlements or pressure federal regulators” the New York Times reported in an extensive 2014 investigation.

RAGA’s 2019 Membership Benefits document details the level of access to AGs and their staff corporate lobbyists receive with contributions from $15000 to $250000 including the opportunity to “lead issue briefings” with the AGs if they pay $50000 or more.

Public records confirm that Wilson has been an active participant in that pay-to-play arrangement.

Dinners and Calls With Donors

Emails obtained by American Oversight from the South Carolina AG’s office reveal a pattern of Wilson meeting with RAGA’s corporate donors when requested followed by those corporations making five-figure donations to RAGA and in some cases to Wilson’s reelection campaign.

For instance at RAGA’s request Wilson had a phone meeting on Sept. 9 2020 with the vice president for corporate affairs at the lawn care company TruGreen. The briefing email RAGA sent in advance included the “ask” that Wilson thank the company’s VP “for their generous support” and a background section that highlighted TruGreen’s Roundtable-level membership which costs the company $25000 a year.

The RAGA briefing email mentions Covid-19 business restrictions and the court case Beyond Pesticides v. TruGreen as public policy areas of interest to the company. Beyond Pesticides sued TruGreen in 2020 for misleading the public about the safety of its products. The complaint alleges that “TruGreen purports to offer environmentally friendly sustainable lawn care services that use no chemicals that may cause cancer allergic reactions or other health or environmental harms” but that these claims are false and deceptive.

Two months after the call with Wilson TruGreen contributed $2500 to his campaign reaching the maximum of $3500 in contributions allowed for the cycle. Overall the company gave a total of $72500 to RAGA during the 2020 election cycle the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) found. RAGA received $20000 of that just two days after the Sept. 9 phone meeting.

TruGreen subsequently contributed $15000 to RAGA in 2021 and $25000 in 2022 according to a CMD analysis of IRS filings.

On July 16 2021 Wilson had a phone meeting at RAGA’s request with two lobbyists from UPS. This time the “ask” was for Wilson to give “an update on RAGA” and “remind them that their membership lapsed in February and ask that they renew this quarter.” RAGA’s 2021 year-end IRS filing suggests that UPS promptly complied renewing its membership with a $15000 contribution just three days later—on July 19 2021. In the 2020 election cycle the UPS PAC contributed $25000 to RAGA.

The briefing email Wilson received before the call lays out the company’s RAGA giving history and public policy interests in great detail. It describes those interests as a proposed SEC rule to require increased “climate change-related disclosures” that RAGA opposed; “claims of labor discrimination or unfair labor practices [that] may be submitted to state attorneys general offices”; “regulation of future technologies”; and a New York lawsuit against UPS for “illegally shipping cigarettes to Native American reservations in circumvention of state tax laws.”

Emails from Wilson’s office also indicate that he attended dinners with RAGA donors. In November 2021 Wilson RSVP’d for a dinner with the “state AG team” of the powerful corporate law firm Cozen O’Connor during RAGA’s Fall National Meeting in California.

“When AGs either alone in multi-state actions or jointly with federal agencies focus their attention on a company’s activities or business practices and an investigation or lawsuit ensues we have the experience and knowledge to mount a vigorous defense” Cozen O’Connor states on its website.

The law firm has contributed over $55000 to RAGA since January 2021 and gave the organization $112650 during the 2020 election cycle

Cozen O’Connor also contributed the maximum $3500 to Wilson’s 2022 reelection campaign a month before the dinner according to a report filed with the South Carolina Ethics Commission.

In 2018 Cozen O’Connor participated in RAGA’s AG Academy a two-day training session for candidates running for state attorney general.

Also on Mar. 2 2020 an email shows that Wilson met at the offices of Altria for “Dine-Around Dinners” during RAGA’s Winter National Meeting in Washington D.C.

One of the world’s largest producers of tobacco products Altria has donated $375000 to RAGA since January 2021 IRS filings show. With $609154 in contributions it also proved to be the organization’s seventh largest donor during the 2020 election cycle.

Altria has also given the maximum of $3500 for Wilson’s 2022 reelection bid.

Serving RAGA’s Top Donor

The top donor to RAGA in 2021 and the first quarter of 2022 is its longtime biggest funder the Judicial Crisis Network (formally registered with the IRS as The Concord Fund). Leonard Leo Trump’s “judge whisperer” and co-chair of the Federalist Society leads the dark money group which has given RAGA $3.5 million so far this election cycle an analysis of IRS filings by CMD found.

On June 10 2021 weeks after becoming RAGA’s national chairman Wilson was scheduled to meet with a “Judicial Coalition” including Mike Thompson and Gary Marx. The Concord Fund’s latest publicly available IRS filing shows that Marx serves as secretary treasurer and director of the organization.

Although Thompson is not affiliated with The Concord Fund he is a senior vice president with Leo’s CRC Advisors which receives a monthly stipend to consult for RAGA.

Peter Bisbee RAGA’s executive director is listed as point of contact (“POC”) on the email along with RAGA scheduler Seline Morrissette. Bisbee previously worked as director of state courts and deputy director of external relations at the Federalist Society when Leo still served as its executive vice president.

Leo’s court capture network has raised at least $600 million since 2014 to reshape laws and shift the federal court system to the far right True North Research reported.

Emails from the South Carolina AG’s office also show that on Apr. 12 2021 Wilson received an election policy proposal from the Honest Elections Project. (HEP)

HEP is a dark money voter suppression group created in February 2020 as a project of The 85 Fund a well-funded cog in the Leo network that distributes millions in grants to an array of rightwing groups. In addition to his roles at The Concord Fund Marx also serves as treasurer of The 85 Fund.

AG Wilson was invited to deliver a keynote speech at HEP’s two-day voter suppression “academy” in conjunction with the July 2021 American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) Annual Meeting emails detail. When Wilson declined Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita an avid proponent of Trump’s Big Lie and a member of RAGA delivered the keynote instead CMD first reported.

ALEC is working with HEP to develop and promote model bills that are less about honesty in elections than voter suppression and perpetuating mistrust in the process CMD revealed.

Wilson Promoted Judge Barrett for Koch Network

Before he became RAGA’s chairman Wilson participated in a Facebook Live event in October 2020 to promote Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court. Americans for Prosperity (AFP) billionaire Charles Koch’s astroturf operation facilitated his involvement.

Koch’s network of companies and political organizations are also among the top donors to the Republican AGs’ group. Since January 2021 RAGA has received $130400 from AFP $375000 from Koch Industries and $1270 from Koch Companies Public Sector. During the 2019–20 election cycle Koch Industries contributed $425000 to RAGA with Koch Companies Public Sector chipping in an additional $23000.

On Oct. 5 2020 Andrew Yates state director for AFP-South Carolina wrote Wilson’s office to ask for his participation in a Facebook Live event supporting Barretts confirmation:

We [AFP] are working hard across the country to get Judge Barrett’s nomination passed through the senate. We have had conversations with friendly AGs in several states with more currently planned out and I would love to set up a FB live with myself and a colleague (cc’d) to discuss the nomination and why it is so vital for our country with AG Wilsons [sic] point of view on the issue and policy.

A week later Wilson and Yates joined AFP’s VP of Judicial Policy Casey Mattox for a Facebook Live event on the morning of Oct. 12 2020 to discuss a series of questions composed by AFP to aid the confirmation effort.

Koch Industries supported Wilson’s reelection campaign in 2018 CMD reported and has contributed the maximum $3500 to his 2022 reelection bid.

RAGA Forever Tied to Jan. 6 Insurrection

RAGA was a member of the March to Save America coalition which organized the Jan. 6 rally in D.C. to overturn the presidential election results that culminated in a violent invasion of the U.S. Capitol. Its former chair Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton spoke at the rally alongside then-President Trump and RLDF ran robocalls ahead of time explicitly urging Trump supporters to travel to Washington and march on the Capitol.

RAGA attempted to distance itself from its involvement in the uprising but many longtime employees resigned when RLDF’s Executive Director Peter Bisbee who was responsible for the robocalls was selected to lead RAGA.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8va2VueWFud2FsbHN0cmVldC5jb20vMjAyMi10aGUtYmVzdC1tYXJpanVhbmEtc3RvY2tzLXRvLWludmVzdC1pbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2022 Marijuana Stocks List | The Best Marijuana Stocks To Invest In Now,"Spreadsheet & table updated daily. Updated on May 24th 2022 by Jonathan Weber for SureDividend

The marijuana industry continues to experience a lot of growth. Multiple countries around the world have already moved to legalized recreational marijuana. In the U.S. 18 states plus DC have legalized recreational marijuana already with many more having legalized medicinal use – 39 in total. It is likely that more states will follow suit in the coming years and eventually there might be federal legalization of marijuana in the US.

While this naturally leads to a potentially significant investment opportunity investors would do well to remember some of the industry bubbles of the past. For example the tech bubble of the late 1990’s is a constant reminder that rapid industry growth alone does not guarantee investing success. Choosing the highest-quality companies (or least risky stocks) in a growing industry can make a world of difference for returns.

This article takes a deep dive into the marijuana industry in search of the best marijuana stocks today. Surprisingly there are over 100 to choose from with full or partial exposure to the marijuana industry.

Industry Overview

The cannabis plant can be divided into 2 broad categories based on tetrahydrocannabinol [THC] content:

High THC – what we often refer to as marijuana

Nearly no THC – what we often refer to as hemp

Marijuana has recreational and pharmaceutical uses while hemp has primarily industrial uses.

Interestingly THC is one of more than 480 known substances in the plant with more than 60 of those being cannabinoids.

Marijuana can be used either by smoking by vaporizing as content in food or beverages or as an extract.

Marijuana Use & Legality Around The Globe

Over the last couple of years marijuana laws around the globe have been relaxed in many cases an increasing number of countries (and US states) have legalized the medical and in some cases the recreational use of marijuana. The drug has so far not been legalized on the federal level in the US though. The image below shows legalization by country/state blue countries and states allow recreational cannabis use while green countries and states allow the medical use of cannabis.

Source

Marijuana has been partially or fully legalized in around 50 countries as of May 2022. In most cases medical marijuana has been legalized while the recreational use of marijuana has not (yet) been legalized.

In Canada marijuana was fully legalized on the federal level in 2018. Several other countries such as Germany and Mexico have decriminalized the use and possession of small amounts of marijuana.

In the majority of US states marijuana has been at least partially legalized and the number of those states has grown steadily in recent years.

Source

18 states as well as the District of Columbia allow the recreational use of marijuana by adults with age restrictions ranging from 18 to 21.

In those countries and US states where marijuana has not been legalized marijuana is still used regularly. It is the most commonly used illegal drug in both the world as well as in the United States where a 2021 study found that 49% of Americans had used the drug at least once. Globally around 190 million people use marijuana for recreational purposes every year according to UN estimates.

Medical Use Of Marijuana

Medical marijuana also called medical cannabis refers to marijuana that has been prescribed by doctors to their patients as a form of treatment for a variety of symptoms. Evidence suggests that the consumption of marijuana (or marijuana-based products) can have positive impacts on patients with certain conditions that are not explained by the placebo effect.

The use cases for medical marijuana include:

The treatment of nausea and vomiting for patients undergoing chemotherapy

Increasing appetite for patients with an HIV/AIDS infection

The treatment of chronic pain (e.g. caused by peripheral neuropathy) and muscle spasms

The treatment of neurological issues such as multiple sclerosis (MS) epilepsy and movement problems.

Sleep improvement

the reduction of tics for patients with Tourette syndrome

the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder

In those countries where medical marijuana has been legalized it oftentimes has only been allowed for a couple of years. The medical marijuana market thus is still in a relatively early phase of growth.

Potential growth catalysts for the industry include:

Rising usage in countries that have legalized the use of cannabis More countries legalizing the use of cannabis

A study from 2022 suggest that the US legal marijuana market (medical and recreational) will grow to as much as $80 billion by 2030. The report that was published by Grand View Research sees an annual market growth rate in excess of 25% in that time frame.

For doctors to increasingly prescribe medical marijuana instead of opioid narcotics (which can cause addiction and serious side effects and are thus not necessarily harmless) is seen as another long-term growth driver for the use of medical marijuana as a form of pain relief.

The most important geographic markets will be those where healthcare budgets are meaningful and where marijuana has been (partially) legalized. This includes the United States (states where the use of medical marijuana has been legalized) Canada Israel Australia parts of Europe (Germany Italy France The Netherlands) and parts of South America (Chile Argentina).

Recreational Use Of Marijuana

Marijuana the world’s most commonly used illegal drug has a potentially very wide (and growing) legal recreational market.

In the US the recreational cannabis market is forecasted to grow to $25 billion by 2025 although growth is forecasted to slow down meaningfully over time – to just 5%-10% a year by the middle of the current decade.

According to this 2022 report the recreational cannabis market in Canada is generating sales of $11 billion a year while also sustaining more than 90000 jobs across manufacturing retail and so on. More Canadians have started using the drug in recent years since it has been legalized while some users who consumed illicit marijuana have shifted towards consuming regulated legal cannabis instead.

Even though marijuana has not been legalized in the United States on a federal level the US still has become the most important market for recreational marijuana over the years. In the 18 states where marijuana has been legalized a number that will likely continue to grow over the coming years recreational marijuana sales outpaced medical marijuana sales.

Forbes has forecasted that medical marijuana will make up just 35% of global legal marijuana sales in 2022 down from almost 100% one decade earlier. We do believe that it is likely that recreational marijuana could continue to gain market share versus medical marijuana especially if recreational marijuana gets legalized in additional countries and states.

The global peer market is projected to be worth $685 billion by 2025. The global tobacco market for reference is worth about $700 billion annually with a low-single-digit growth rate. Compared to those two markets the recreational marijuana market still is rather small which could indicate a lot of future upside. On the other hand investors should consider that beer and tobacco are legal in more markets around the world compared to marijuana which is still restricted in many parts of the world.

Analysts have been projecting significant market growth for the global marijuana markets for years. In recent years the market has indeed grown meaningfully. But if the current growth projections for 2025-2030 do not materialize e.g. due to legalization changes or shifts in consumer behavior or because these projections were wrong in the first place these market size estimates could turn out to be way too optimistic thus investors should take these projections with a grain of salt.

Investors should also keep the following statement by Benjamin Graham in mind:

“Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not translate into obvious profits for investors.”

Market growth rates do not necessarily go hand in hand with high profits for the corporations that are active in this respective market and they especially do not go hand in hand with meaningful shareholder payouts.

Growth stocks that are priced for perfection can disappoint investors and produce underwhelming total returns even if the original thesis about strong underlying growth rates for the industry proves true.

There are credible arguments to be made against high-profit margins in the marijuana industry. These include the fact that market entry barriers are not overly high — there are no substantial network effects entry costs are not overly large and there are no big technological advantages — and the fact that marijuana is an agricultural good.

Margins in the agricultural industry are notoriously low. Half of all agricultural businesses generate operating profit margins (before interest expenses and before taxes) of less than 5%. It is in no way guaranteed that the same will apply to the marijuana market but it is possible that industry-wide profits in the marijuana industry could be relatively meager despite a large market size.

In recent years we have already seen this play out to some degree. Despite further legalization of marijuana in additional countries and states the stocks of many cannabis companies have underwhelmed as profit margins are slim for many of these companies and since valuations were too high which caused multiple compression headwinds over the years.

Investing In The Marijuana Industry

There are a large number of publicly traded marijuana companies with the biggest ones being located in Canada which is not surprising as Canada is one of the largest markets where marijuana has been fully legalized. Companies in this segment have different strategies such as focusing on the medical marijuana market or certain geographic markets.

There are several ETFs which investors can choose if they are bullish on the industry as a whole and if they do not want to choose among single companies. The largest one of these ETFs is the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF (HMLSF) which has a current net asset value of CAD4.45 per share (May 2022).

The Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF has moved down since our last update. Share price declines in a range of cannabis stocks have caused its net asset value to decline and rising interest rates and high inflation lead to lower interest from investors when it comes to investing in oftentimes barely profitable growth stocks.

This ETF made two distributions in 2021 according to its fact sheet but its estimated annualized yield of 0.81% is not attractive for income investors and does not add meaningfully to the ETF’s total return potential. The Horizons Marijuana Life Science ETF has a relatively high expense ratio of 0.86% annually.

‘Pure Play’ Marijuana Stocks

Investors who are interested in this space can choose from a large list of publicly traded companies with direct exposure to the marijuana market i.e. marijuana pure plays. These are companies which derive all or a vast majority of their revenues from the sale of marijuana and marijuana products for medical use and/or for recreational use.

Many large players in this segment are Canada-based but US-based companies with meaningful market capitalizations exist as well. Outside of North America there are no large players in this space since other countries where (medical) marijuana has been legalized do oftentimes import marijuana from North American companies instead of producing marijuana “at home”.

Most marijuana companies do not have a long history of revenues or earnings because the legal marijuana industry is still relatively young. It seems likely that those marijuana companies with the highest sales base and the largest production capacity have the greatest chance of generating above-average margins in the future. Reasons for this include economics of scale operating leverage and the fact that those with the most experience are likely the best at bringing down costs of production.

On the other hand investors should be careful not to overpay for stocks – which is why the price for a stock should always be looked at relative to metrics such as the earnings or the cash flows that the company generates (on a per-share basis).

This is the list of 10 of the largest pureplay marijuana companies by revenue generation:

Aurora Cannabis (ACB)

Canopy Growth (CGC)

Tilray (TLRY)

Cronos (CRON)

Organigram (OGRMF)

Cresco Labs (CRLBF)

Curaleaf Holdings (CURLF)

Green Thumb Industries (GTBIF)

Trulieve Cannabis (TCNNF)

Columbia Care (CCHWF)

Aphria which was one of the largest marijuana companies originally got taken over by Tilray since our last update. Of these our top three picks are the following ones:

Marijuana Pure Play Stock: Trulieve Cannabis Corp

Trulieve Cannabis Corp isn’t the largest marijuana pureplay company by far. But its profitability is compared to most of its peers outstanding which makes it interesting for investors. Trulieve Cannabis operates as a medical cannabis company that cultivates produces and distributes its products itself through dispensaries in its home market Florida but over the years Trulieve Cannabis has also ventured into other markets including California Arizona Nevada and a couple more.

Source

According to its own data Trulieve sells roughly half of the medical marijuana that is sold in Florida despite operating only one-fourth of the dispensaries in the state. Its scale and large market share especially in its most important market allows Trulieve Cannabis to operate with margins that are stronger than what we see from most of its peers.

For the current fiscal year 2022 Trulieve Cannabis is forecasting revenue of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $450 to $500 million. This does not only point to a pretty solid EBITDA margin in the 30% range but the $450+ million EBITDA generation that is expected for the current year also results in a valuation that doesn’t seem high at all. The company’s market capitalization stands at $2.7 billion which means that it is valued at around 6x this year’s expected adjusted EBITDA. Of course net profits are considerably smaller due to depreciation taxes etc. But still Trulieve Cannabis is one of the more profitable cannabis companies and surprisingly inexpensive at the same time.

Marijuana Pure Play Stock: Canopy Growth

Canopy Growth is by market capitalization one of the largest cannabis companies in Canada. One of the poster children of the cannabis investing boom (or bubble) a couple of years ago its price and market capitalization have pulled back considerably over the last couple of years. That has made its valuation improve which is why it seems like a significantly better investment today.

Canopy Growth isn’t profitable unlike Trulieve but is generating solid revenue of around $400 to $500 million per year and the company has recently announced new cost-cutting measures. Combined with some organic revenue growth that should improve profitability over the years all else equal.

Canopy Growth has also been shifting its product portfolio towards branded consumer goods such as its sports nutrition products under the BioSteel label:

Source

BioSteel and some of Canopy Growth’s other branded products had a record quarter in Q1 which indicates that its shift towards this products could help improve Canopy’s business growth over time. This strategy could help differentiate Canopy Growth from its peers over the years and as long as its brands are attractive they could also help Canopy Growth generate improving margins over time compared to the relatively commoditized pure cannabis production business.

Marijuana Pure Play Stock: Cresco Labs

Cresco Labs Inc. cultivates manufactures and sells both medical and retail cannabis products in US states where it is allowed to do so. Its products include flowers vape pens extracts concentrates but also shakes and popcorn. Not surprisingly the company is active in a wide range of US markets including in important ones such as Florida or California:

Source

The company generates compelling business growth as its revenue rose by 20% during the most recent quarter. EBITDA meanwhile was up by 45% year over year climbing to $51 million. That makes for a 24% EBITDA margin which is a little less than that of Trulieve but which is still far from bad.

Based on its current EBITDA run rate Cresco Labs is valued at around 6x EBITDA which is more or less in line with Trulieve’s valuation. It should be noted that Cresco Labs is not expected to be profitable on a GAAP net profit basis this year due to depreciation taxes interest expenses etc. That’s to be expected and holds true for almost all cannabis companies however. Thanks to its encouraging growth and solid EBITDA margins Cresco Labs should be able to reach GAAP profitability in the not too distant future we believe.

Indirect-Exposure Marijuana Stocks

Marijuana pure play stocks have the problem that their valuations are not low at all and that most of these companies are not profitable yet. It is also not guaranteed that they will (all) become profitable (due to possible margin pressures for the industry). Last but not least investors don’t get any meaningful dividend yields from marijuana pure play stocks.

For investors that don’t want to invest in marijuana pure play stocks due to the reasons outlined above and that seek exposure to the growing marijuana industry nevertheless one possibility is to invest in stocks that are not marijuana pure plays but that have some exposure to the industry nevertheless.

This primarily includes consumer goods companies (beverage stocks tobacco stocks) that have ventured into the marijuana space but that continue to generate the majority of their revenues and earnings in another industry. Our top five picks among these companies are analyzed below.

Indirect Marijuana Exposure Stock: AbbVie

AbbVie (ABBV) is a biotech company that is active in oncology and immunology primarily. AbbVie generates revenues of more than $50 billion annually and is highly profitable with its biggest drug Humira playing an important role in both revenue and earnings generation.

AbbVie is seen by some as one of the first medical marijuana companies as its drug Marinol was the first FDA-approved cannabis drug. Marinol is used for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in patients enduring chemotherapy. Marinol is also used for increasing appetite in patients with HIV/AIDS or certain cancers.

Marinol was not a large revenue driver for AbbVie in the past as other drugs were larger in terms of their addressable market and when it comes to the prices the company could demand for them. AbbVie also sold Marinol to Alkem Labs a while ago. One can argue whether AbbVie should be seen as a marijuana stock but the company has been interested in the space and had FDA-approved products on the market. It seems possible that AbbVie develops new products that utilize marijuana in the future although there is no guarantee of that.

Investors don’t have the high risks that are associated with an investment into a marijuana pure play but might still benefit from growth of the medical marijuana industry. AbbVie trades at an inexpensive valuation of just 11 times 2022’s profits right now. AbbVie also offers a sizeable dividend yield of 3.7% right here. Due to its yield its low valuation and its share price upside potential AbbVie is one of our favorite Dividend Aristocrat buys today.

Indirect Marijuana Exposure Stock: Altria

Altria (MO) is one of the largest tobacco companies in the world. Altria produces and sells cigarettes under the Marlboro brand in the US. The company also sells several other cigarette brands cigar brands and non-smokeable tobacco products to round out the company’s product portfolio. In addition Altria owns a 10% stake in Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) which is one of the world’s largest beer companies.

As a tobacco company Altria is primed for an expansion into the marijuana space which is why the company has taken a stake in Canadian marijuana company Cronos. In December 2018 Altria agreed to pay $1.8 billion for a 45% stake in Cronos. Additionally Altria has an option to acquire another 10% at a fixed price. Since then there has been speculation that Altria might make a bid to take over Cronos entirely with these rumors boiling up again in 2021. So far no deal to acquire all of Cronos has been announced however and it is far from certain that such a deal will be crafted in the future.

Compared to Altria’s market capitalization of $96 billion its Cronos stake is not overly large but it provides an entry into this potentially large market. In case marijuana gets legalized in the US on a federal level Altria could likely expand into this space very fast thanks to the know-how that the company acquires through its stake in Cronos and through Altria’s established (tobacco) sales channels across all of the United States.

Altria is highly profitable trades at just 11 times 2022’s earnings and offers a hefty dividend yield of 7.1% which makes it a high dividend stock. We believe that Altria is a compelling pick for investors that seek an income investment with some potential upside through a side-venture in the marijuana space.

Indirect Marijuana Exposure Stock: Associated British Foods

Associated British Foods (ASBFY) is a London UK based company that is active in several industries. The company operates in the sugar production and agricultural industries but it also produces beverages cereals and other food products. Last but not least Associated British Foods has established itself as a low-cost apparel retailer with its Primark brand.

Associated British Foods has ventured into the marijuana industry by becoming a marijuana cultivator and supplier to the medical industry. Unlike many marijuana pure plays Associated British Foods is highly profitable and produces sizeable cash flows thanks to its other businesses which means that this is a lower-risk stock that could potentially grow its marijuana business at a fast pace through organic investments thanks to its cash generation from other business units.

As Associated British Foods is experienced in growing farm products and producing snacks and beverages which gives the company the potential to introduce marijuana-containing products snacks and beverages the expansion into the marijuana industry seems like a reasonable move.

Associated British Foods which is valued at $16 billion today trades at 13 times this year’s earnings which is not a high valuation at all. Associated British Foods offers a dividend yielding 2.7% which is more than what investors can get from the broad market. The company has raised its dividend regularly and at an ample pace in the past.

Indirect Marijuana Exposure Stock: Constellation Brands

Constellation Brands (STZ) is one of the largest alcoholic beverages companies in the world. Constellation Brands is focused on the wine and spirits markets but it owns a small beer segment as well.

Constellation Brands made news when the company announced a $4 billion investment in Canadian marijuana company Canopy Growth. This deal diluted Canopy Growth’s existing shareholders but it gave Constellation Brands a substantial position in the marijuana industry.

Constellation Brands sees significant potential for marijuana-infused beverages and due to its experience in the beverages industry and its existing sales networks Constellation Brands will likely become one of the biggest players in this (potentially large) market.

Even if this venture does not work out Constellation Brands would remain a profitable company and investors would likely not suffer too much from a failure in this space. Today Constellation Brands trades at 21 times this year’s earnings which isn’t cheap but which also isn’t especially expensive compared to how many other alcoholic beverages companies are valued.

Investors get a dividend that yields 1.4% from Constellation Brands which is not really a lot but better than what one receives from pure-play cannabis stocks as those generally make no dividend payments at all. At the same time the stake in Canopy Growth allows for substantial upside potential in case things go well.

Indirect Marijuana Exposure Stock: Molson Coors

Molson Coors (TAP) is a beverage company as well but unlike Constellation Brands it is focused on the global beer market. Molson Coors which is based in Denver CO has moved into the marijuana industry through a joint venture with Hydropothecary a Canada-based marijuana producer. The joint venture focuses on producing marijuana-containing but alcohol-free beverages.

The join venture first moved into the Canadian market when it was legal to do so but international expansion was only natural and additional market should get added over time as cannabis gets legalized in more and more countries and states. Due to Molson Coors’ existing global sales networks it is likely that the venture between Molson Coors and Hydropothecary would be able to capture significant market share in overseas markets if the opportunity arises e.g. when additional countries in Europe or South America legalize marijuana/marijuana products.

Molson Coors is trading at a relatively inexpensive valuation of just 13 times 2022’s earnings and investors get paid a dividend yield of 2.1% at current prices.

The Best Marijuana Stocks

The marijuana industry is still young which means that both risks and potential rewards are elevated.

In the pure play space Trulieve Cannabis looks inexpensive relative to other marijuana pure plays while at the same time it is operating with above-average profitability which reduces financial risks to some degree. Legal and regulatory risks remain of course.

Marijuana pure play companies are mostly not profitable and do not pay dividends. More risk-averse investors with a goal of steady income generation should rather look at companies with some indirect marijuana exposure.

This list includes established companies with long and steady dividend growth records that will be more suitable for many investors compared to the higher-risk pure plays.

Among those stocks with indirect exposure there are several ones that are reasonably to attractively priced and that offer an above-average dividend yield on top of that. These companies give investors the ability to benefit from future growth opportunities in the marijuana industry without taking on a lot of risk.

Of these Altria is our favorite indirect exposure marijuana stock in May 2022 thanks to its low valuation and strong total return outlook driven by its outstanding dividend yield of more than 7%. Its marijuana exposure is not as large as that of pure plays of course but in case marijuana gets legalized on a federal level in the US Altria still could be a major beneficiary. The fact that it is a Dividend Aristocrats that has raised the dividend like clockwork for several decades is also a highly attractive trait for many income investors.

Final Thoughts

When it comes to marijuana there is a clear trend of decriminalization and outright legalization for both medicinal and recreational purposes in the U.S. and across the globe. This means that the potential market for legal marijuana continues to grow.

That said investors should not blindly jump into this industry based solely on the market potential. Many of the companies in this industry are not profitable and may never reach profitability. As a result investing in marijuana stocks is fraught with risk. It is not guaranteed that all major marijuana companies (some of which are valued at several billion dollars) will grow into their valuations in a reasonable amount of time.

Investors should take a close look at all relevant data points before making any decisions especially in a higher-risk environment such as the marijuana industry. Choosing lower-risk stocks which allow for some indirect exposure to the industry could be an opportune move for investors especially for those that desire regular and reliable dividend income from their stock holdings.

Airlines reported record revenues and full planes as issues from staffing to weather and an elevated number of employees out sick with Covid kept capacity constrained.

Sounds like a recipe for financial success right? Well there’s the matter of fuel. The average price per gallon for U.S. Gulf Coast jet fuel reached a record $4.12 in March up from $1.86 per gallon a year earlier — a more than two-fold increase — according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Some airlines though had a secret weapon: fuel hedges. Southwest Airlines is one example. It paid just $3.36 per gallon for its fuel last quarter a big reason why it produced the best second quarter operating margin — 17 percent — of any airline worldwide that’s reported thus far.

Hedges behave like insurance contracts. In Southwest’s case it expects to pay what’s essentially a two-cent per gallon insurance premium this quarter. But at current spot prices it expects to collect a cash settlement of 46 cents per gallon. As of July 28 Southwest had 59 percent of its third quarter fuel needs hedged with contracts currently holding a market value of about $235 million far above the $13 million in premiums the airline paid.

Alaska Airlines was not quite as well hedged but had enough protection to also pay below $4 per gallon for fuel last quarter. The same was true for Delta Air Lines which benefited from its ownership of an oil refinery near Philadelphia.

Most other U.S. airlines burned by fuel hedges in years past largely refrain from hedging today. This lack of protection left Frontier Airlines for one paying $4.41 per gallon. American Airlines JetBlue Airways and United Airlines paid above $4 as well. The non-hedgers argue that in the long-run hedging is a losing proposition with periodic gains outweighed by periodic losses plus the cost of the premiums. During the 2008-09 financial crisis when fuel prices initially plummeted holding wrong-way hedges nearly bankrupted Air Canada. Others like Delta suffered giant hedge losses as well. Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific Airways was another carrier to post extreme fuel hedge losses in recent years.

Fuel hedging is more prevalent among airlines outside of the U.S. So is foreign exchange hedging also a big help this year as a strong U.S. dollar adds to the cost of dollar-denominated input costs including fuel. Aircraft are also generally priced in U.S. dollars.

Like Southwest in the U.S. Ryanair was a big beneficiary of hedging this spring. It currently pays the crude oil equivalent of $62 per barrel for about 60 percent of its needs. That amounts to huge savings — spot prices for Brent crude have been well above $100 per barrel for most of this year. Ryanair reported an 8 percent operating margin for the June quarter the highest among reporting European airlines. Larger airlines like Air France-KLM International Airlines Group and the Lufthansa Group however are active fuel and foreign exchange hedgers too.

The importance of fuel hedging this year is no less evident in Asia. Singapore Airlines for example had one of its best quarters in many years thanks in part to a roughly $150 million gain from its hedging contracts. Its operating margin was 14 percent.

Hedges might prove less of a tailwind in the September quarter. Oil prices are falling and the average cost of a gallon of Gulf Coast jet fuel dropped to $3.48 in July.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmthcmUxMS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9uZXdzL25hdGlvbi13b3JsZC9yZWZ1bmQtcHJvdGVjdGlvbi11cy1mbHllcnMvNTA3LTRlY2I1YjEwLTgyNjQtNDllYy1iYzc3LTI3OTg0OGYxMTdmZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Federal rule change could mean more airline refunds,"Under the proposed rule change a refund would be required if a plane departed or arrived more than three hours behind schedule.

WASHINGTON — The Transportation Department is proposing to require airlines to offer passengers a refund if their flight schedule is changed significantly or the airline makes major changes to their itinerary.

The proposed rule announced Wednesday would require airlines to give refunds if their departure or arrival time changes by three hours or more for a domestic flight or at least six hours for an international one.

Refunds would also be due if the airline changes the passenger’s departure or arrival airport adds stops in their itinerary or causes “a significant downgrade"" in the travel experience by switching to a different type of plane.

The rule would apply even for travelers who buy nonrefundable tickets which usually cost less and are favored by many leisure travelers.

The proposal comes after the department was flooded with complaints by passengers whose flights were canceled or changed — or who were afraid to fly during the early months of the pandemic — and who couldn't get refunds.

Airlines prefer to hand out travel vouchers instead of refunds.

The department proposes to require that airlines and ticket agents give vouchers that don't expire for passengers who are told not to travel during a pandemic for health reasons or because borders are closed.

The proposal faces a public-comment period and likely opposition by airlines. Their trade group Airlines for America did not immediately comment.

Currently airlines are required to offer refunds to passengers whose flights are canceled or significantly changed but it has never defined a cancellation or significant change. Because of that airlines have challenged the Transportation Department’s authority to force them to pay refunds.

“When Americans buy an airline ticket they should get to their destination safely reliably and affordably” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement. “This new proposed rule would protect the rights of travelers and help ensure they get the timely refunds they deserve from the airlines.”

Consumer complaints filed with the department rose nearly seven-fold in 2020 from the year before and 87% were about refunds.

The department will take public comments on the proposal for 90 days. A group that advises the department and includes consumer advocates scheduled an online meeting to discuss the rule on Aug. 22."

Joe Manchin (D-WV) on July 27 2022—offers the best opportunity yet to address the climate crisis. The legislation makes a historic investment of $369 billion in climate action over the next decade through clean energy deployment domestic manufacturing and pollution reduction. Yet these investments add up to more than just the biggest expenditure to tackle climate change in U.S. history; the bill invests in the people and communities that will build and benefit from the clean energy economy lowering costs creating millions of new good jobs and cutting pollution along the way. Here are five ways the Inflation Reduction Act’s climate investments would bring benefits to households and communities across the United States.

1. Households could receive $28500 in up-front incentives to buy electric vehicles and household appliances Using the tax incentives and rebates in the Inflation Reduction Act a low- or moderate-income household could choose from a variety of incentives that add up to $28500 to switch to efficient electric home appliances install rooftop solar and buy new electric vehicles.

Learn more The Inflation Reduction Act makes the transition to an all-electric home more affordable than ever by offering the following incentives which would be available beginning this year if enacted: Purchasing electric vehicles : The Inflation Reduction Act offers up to $7500 toward the purchase of a new electric vehicle or up to $4000 toward the purchase of a used electric vehicle. Eligibility is capped so that these credits are not available to the wealthiest families—those earning more than $300000 per year for new vehicles or $150000 per year for used vehicles.

Eligibility is capped so that these credits are not available to the wealthiest families—those earning more than $300000 per year for new vehicles or $150000 per year for used vehicles. Installing rooftop solar : The Inflation Reduction Act provides for 30 percent off the cost of rooftop solar which amounts to average savings of $7000 according to estimates from the Sierra Club. The bill also offers 30 percent off the cost of home batteries for the first time.

The bill also offers 30 percent off the cost of home batteries for the first time. Switching to electric appliances : The Inflation Reduction Act offers homes up to $14000 in rebates to switch over to electric appliances—covering up to 50 percent of the costs for moderate-income households and 100 percent of the costs for low-income households. The total program is capped at $4.5 billion. This includes up to: $8000 for a heat pump which serves as an air conditioner in the summer and heater in the winter $1750 for a high-efficiency all-electric heat pump water heater $840 for an electric induction cooktop $840 for a high-efficiency all-electric heat pump clothes dryer Up to $9100 for enabling improvements to the electric panel wiring and home insulation

: The Inflation Reduction Act offers homes up to $14000 in rebates to switch over to electric appliances—covering up to 50 percent of the costs for moderate-income households and 100 percent of the costs for low-income households. The total program is capped at $4.5 billion. This includes up to: Improving energy efficiency : An alternative rebate option offers to cover more than 50 percent of the cost of whole-home energy efficiency retrofit or more than 80 percent in the case of homes occupied by low- or moderate-income households. Households that do not participate in either rebate program can still claim a variety of home energy tax credits which are improved and extended for 10 years by the bill.

: An alternative rebate option offers to cover more than 50 percent of the cost of whole-home energy efficiency retrofit or more than 80 percent in the case of homes occupied by low- or moderate-income households. Households that do not participate in either rebate program can still claim a variety of home energy tax credits which are improved and extended for 10 years by the bill. Making major investments in affordable housing and multifamily rental units: The Inflation Reduction Act’s investment incentives aren’t just for individual homeowners; in fact the bill provides rebates of up to $400000 for whole-building energy efficiency retrofits in large multifamily apartment buildings as well as grants and loans worth $1 billion in total for improving efficiency and installing zero-emission equipment in affordable housing units.

2. Families could save up to $1800 in annual costs for gasoline and utility bills as a result of electrification Any family that chooses to take advantage of the many programs within the Inflation Reduction Act to switch to electricity could save up to $1800 per year in energy costs according to Rewiring America. Since energy prices will go down across the board even families who do not electrify will benefit. Nationwide the average family is projected to spend $1025 less on energy in 2030 than it does today according to the Rhodium Group.

Learn more The Inflation Reduction Act’s investments in electrification would reduce household energy costs for the following reasons: Electric appliances are three to five times more efficient than their fossil-fuel counterparts.

More than 100 million American households stand to save money every month on their energy bills from electrifying just their furnaces and water heaters.

Consumer Reports estimates that electric vehicle drivers save between $1800 and $2600 annually which is similar to the Rewiring America estimate but takes into account the reduced maintenance costs as well as the energy cost savings of electric vehicles.

Even families that don’t switch out their vehicles and energy systems will see major cost savings. By 2030 Rhodium projects that electricity rates and fuel prices will decline. Across those who take the electrification credits and those who do not but still benefit from lower energy prices Rhodium expects the average household will spend $1025 less on energy costs than it does today. That includes $63 in estimated savings on electricity bills $105 on other home energy bills and $857 on gasoline.

3. 1.5 million new good jobs would be created in 2030 The investments in the Inflation Reduction Act—including the clean energy tax credits and clean energy manufacturing incentives—could create up to 1.5 million new U.S. jobs in 2030 in construction manufacturing and service according to Energy Innovation. The bill’s investments also expand equitable access to and training for these manufacturing jobs.

Learn more Paired with the CHIPS and Science Act the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and President Joe Biden’s work to expand “Buy America” the Inflation Reduction Act would provide the means for the United States to take control of its own clean energy future—fostering a homegrown robust clean energy manufacturing sector. Expanding domestic clean energy capacity means that energy prices will be less vulnerable to global supply shocks in the future: Establishing wage and apprenticeship requirements: Many wind solar manufacturing and carbon management projects that take advantage of the tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act can get full benefit of those credits only if they pay workers a prevailing wage and include individuals who have completed a registered apprenticeship program which can help diversify the workforce and grow the pool of skilled workers. Moreover many provisions include an additional 10 percent bonus if projects use materials manufactured in the United States.

Many wind solar manufacturing and carbon management projects that take advantage of the tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act can get full benefit of those credits only if they pay workers a prevailing wage and include individuals who have completed a registered apprenticeship program which can help diversify the workforce and grow the pool of skilled workers. Moreover many provisions include an additional 10 percent bonus if projects use materials manufactured in the United States. Revitalizing American manufacturing: The bill’s investments would revitalize U.S. manufacturing including through new tax credits for the production of solar panels and battery cells; $10 billion for reinvestment in manufacturing communities; $5.8 billion for federal procurement of zero- and low-emission manufactured products; $3 billion to expand and establish electric vehicle manufacturing facilities; $2 billion to help current automakers transition to electric vehicles or hybrids; and $6 billion to support technologies that will help heavy manufacturing facilities slash their emissions.

4. Up to 3900 lives would be saved annually by 2030 as a result of cleaner air According to Energy Innovation pollution reductions from the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy investments would save an estimated 3900 lives annually by 2030 avoiding unnecessary premature deaths resulting from bad air quality. Importantly the modeler finds that pollution-related deaths would decline by a greater percentage in communities of color where the burdens of pollution have too long been concentrated.

Learn more The Inflation Reduction Act would cut harmful air pollution which is disproportionately concentrated in communities of color: The Inflation Reduction Act’s pollution reductions would prevent up to 100000 asthma attacks annually by 2030.

In analyzing the tax credits included in the Inflation Reduction Act the Rhodium Group found that the credits together with state and federal regulatory action would cut harmful air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide emissions 86 to 89 percent below 2020 levels by 2030 and nitrous oxide emissions 59 to 63 percent below 2020 levels by 2030.

These strong results were found on the basis of only some of the larger climate-related investments and in spite of the deal’s inclusion of forced oil and gas lease sales; additional significant air pollution reductions are to be expected from dedicated programs including healthy ports the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grants the Neighborhood Access and Equity Grant Program and other programs.

5. Climate pollution would be reduced to 40 percent below peak levels Three independent modelers confirm that the major climate investments in the Inflation Reduction Act are likely to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to 40 percent below peak 2005 levels by 2030. When coupled with continued ambitious action by President Biden and the states this bill would put within reach the United States’ commitment under the Paris Agreement: slashing climate pollution to half of peak levels by 2030.

Learn more Preliminary results from three independent modelers confirm that the combined effects of the Inflation Reduction Act’s investments will amount to major emissions reductions: The Rhodium Group finds that with the Inflation Reduction Act emissions in 2030 would reach 31 to 44 percent below 2005 levels—far better than their business-as-usual projection of just 24 to 35 percent. That means this one bill would close 27 to 60 percent of the gap between business as usual and the climate goal.

Similarly Energy Innovation finds that with the Inflation Reduction Act emissions in 2030 would reach 37 to 41 percent below 2005 levels—far better than their business-as-usual projection of just 24 percent. That means this one bill would close 50 to 66 percent of the gap between business as usual and the climate goal.

To further affirm the emissions reduction benefits the REPEAT Project finds that with the Inflation Reduction Act emissions in 2030 would reach roughly 41 percent below 2005 levels—far better than their business-as-usual projection of just 26 percent. That means this one bill would close 63 percent of the gap between business as usual and the climate goal.

It is important to note that in order to strike this historic climate deal Senate negotiators acceded to some difficult tradeoffs—particularly provisions that may continue the production of dirty fossil fuels. While the net effect of such provisions is included in these modeling results any continuation of oil drilling on our public lands and waters keeps communities that are on the front lines of fossil fuel pollution in harm’s way. The climate and justice investments in the Inflation Reduction Act will supercharge efforts to reduce pollution in overburdened communities but the hard work of pushing back against Big Oil’s influence on policymaking and fighting for a safe future for all communities has not ended.

Seriously?,"“When politicians are out there saying ‘Let’s get rid of all cars using gasoline’ do they understand this?” Toyota President Akio Toyoda asked in 2020 referring to the profound consequences of politicians forcing a transition away from conventional vehicles.

It’s a good question and a proposal in the so-called Inflation Reduction Act being pushed through Congress suggests the answer is “no.”

President Joe Biden has used a variety of policy vehicles to force a transition from the ubiquitous internal combustion engine to electric vehicles. Among them are executive orders procurement mandates for the military and regulations to make it almost impossible to manufacture and sell a conventional car or truck.

The Senate is poised to join in. Heaped on top of tens of billions of dollars in grants taxpayer-backed loans and investment tax credits for EV manufacturers the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act negotiated by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer D-N.Y. and Sen. Joe Manchin D-W.Va. proposes an extension of EV tax subsidies.

The bill offers up to $7500 in tax credits for new EV purchases including bonuses for EVs made by union labor and batteries manufactured or assembled in North America. The legislation also makes the existing EV tax credit even bigger by eliminating caps on sales adding a new tax credit of $4000 for used EVs and extending the credits for the next decade.

While there are some improvements—unlike the existing credit the credit is not available for Americans earning more than $300000 jointly or for EVs containing batteries made with critical minerals from “foreign entities of concern”—they don’t address the real problem.

The problem isn’t the size of the credit or even EVs themselves. The real problem is politicians attempting to force a transition to energy sources they prefer having no inhibitions about the arrogance of such a central planning scheme the restrictions it imposes on freedom or the trade-offs limitations and collateral damage those policies cause at Americans’ expense.

Trade-offs Limitations and Collateral Damage

There’s no perfect vehicle or energy. All involve compromises that individuals families and businesses prioritize differently. Yet too many politicians think they know what’s perfect and the right vehicle for everyone else. And as they inappropriately impose their preferences on Americans they ignore the costs of forcing EVs would impose on the country.

Let’s count some of the ways.

1. The disconnect between reality and political aspirations is wide. A full 90% of Americans’ transportation energy needs are covered by petroleum. EVs make up about 1% of registered vehicles in the U.S. despite years of federal and state subsidies. The International Energy Agency estimates that politicians’ aspirations for EV deployment under the Paris Agreement climate commitments imply a thirtyfold increase in demand for minerals used in EV batteries by 2040. That’s perhaps why the head of EV company Rivian warned that ongoing supply chain problems with “semiconductors are a small appetizer to what we are about to feel on battery cells over the next two decades.”

2. EVs trade fuel dependency for mineral dependency. While conventional cars and trucks rely on global markets for crude oil and refining capacity (both of which the U.S. is a major global supplier of) EVs must rely on global markets for mining and refining of minerals which account for more than half the cost of an EV battery.

Minerals such as lithium cobalt nickel graphite and copper are needed to manufacture batteries and other components in EVs. According to the International Energy Agency EVs use six times more minerals than a conventional car. The agency estimates that it takes more than 16 years on average to get a mine up and running from the moment of discovery of mineral deposits. Yet the Biden administration has done its level best to block new mining capacity in the United States particularly in Minnesota and Alaska.

American miners are a small player in global markets for the minerals needed for EVs: Chile is the world’s largest mining country for copper; Indonesia for nickel; Australia for lithium and—far more troublesome when it comes to human rights abuses and environmental stewardship—China for rare earth minerals and the Democratic Republic of Congo for cobalt.

Refining capacity for these minerals is deeply concentrated in China.

In other words “concerns about price volatility and security of supply do not disappear in an electrified renewables-rich energy system.”

3. EVs are being used as a pretext for big government favors to labor unions. While there is certainly no reason why policies addressing EVs have to be special favors for labor unions the Schumer-Manchin bill would give bonus tax subsidies for EVs made with union labor. This is just good old-fashioned cronyism. Further these policies would inflate EV costs and penalize most workers who prefer not to join a union. It could even backfire and lead to fewer electric vehicles being produced and sold in the U.S. Only about 14% of autoworkers are unionized in the U.S. Meanwhile foreign-owned automakers now employ more U.S. workers than domestic automakers.

4. Policies pushing EVs are corporate welfare and special favors for the wealthy. Of the estimated $7.5 billion in existing EV credits to be claimed between 2018 and 2022 corporations will take about half. Of the other half claimed by individual Americans 78% will go to people making more than $100000 per year. One state leads the pack: California is home to 39% of registered electric vehicles—perhaps unsurprising inasmuch as the state is banning the sale of gasoline-powered vehicles starting in 2035 as part of its radical climate agenda.

5. There’s no guarantee that EVs reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Regardless of how one views the issue of global warming EVs are no surefire solution. EVs have to plug in somewhere and 60% of the electricity consumed in the U.S. is generated from natural gas and coal. Ironically even as the need for electricity generation would grow federal regulators and some states are trying to choke off production and use of natural gas as a power source just as they’ve been trying to do to coal for years. It’s no wonder grid operators have heightened concerns about reliability.

6. EVs come with trade-offs for owners. EVs bring interesting capabilities to the table but they also have detractors. Currently many EVs cost more than their conventional counterparts. Refueling takes time. EV batteries lose an average of 2% of their capacity each year (depending on exposure to temperature extremes how often an owner charges the battery and other habits that degrade batteries) and replacement is costly. Some parking garages even prohibit drivers from parking in them due to the risks of batteries potentially catching on fire. And the driving range of EVs decreases and heating becomes a costly choice in cold weather which is probably why very few EVs are registered in cold-weather states that don’t heavily subsidize them or penalize gasoline cars.

It’s one thing for an individual family or company to weigh trade-offs and make the decision to purchase an EV. It’s a totally different matter for politicians or bureaucrats to force the decision on Americans.

Competition made America a great country in which to innovate run a business and shop for products that meet the diverse needs of Americans. EVs are one of a variety of options out there competing for Americans’ business and should compete on their merits.

Unless Congress comes to its senses American taxpayers will be covering the costs of big government EV policies whether they buy an EV or not.

According to the Society of Human Resources Management's (SHRM's) 2022 Employee Benefits Survey which features responses from 3129 HR professionals the number of companies offering employee mental health-care benefits in 2022 is up to 91% from 85% in 2021 and 2020.

But how can small-business owners whose companies often have less financial resources make meaningful investments in mental health-care benefits?

The answer is a combination of two essential actions: expanding what you consider to be mental health care and taking open and honest action. These tips can help your company build a tailored and competitive mental health-care benefits package.

One of the often overlooked affordable and tailored mental health benefit options is contracting with a small group practice in your area.

—Dr. Janelle S. Peifer clinical psychologist

1. Start with company culture.

Despite the number of companies offering mental health-care benefits there remains a stigma surrounding mental health care. When you make mental health care a part of your company’s benefits package you’re starting a conversation that can change your company culture and societal acceptance of mental wellness.

These two actions can help you begin to transform your company’s mental health-care culture from the inside out:

Create anonymous feedback mechanisms.

A 2021 AllVoices survey of 817 individuals from the U.S. who are employed full time showed that 74% would give employers more honest feedback if it were truly anonymous. You can use free online tools to start inviting feedback at no cost to you and no risk to your team.

Implement and honor an open-door policy.

Forty-one percent of people in the AllVoices survey said they’ve left a job because they didn't feel listened to. After you receive that anonymous feedback boost morale by creating a system to report your actions on suggestions and frustrations back to your team. If you use regular team meetings to report results you could find that team members are happy to help crowdsource solutions too.

2. Ask direct questions.

As a small-business owner you have a unique advantage over larger companies: a smaller employee roster. By asking employees about the benefits that would most improve their mental health you’ll likely some high-demand items aren't necessarily what you’d normally consider mental health care.

For example if you have multiple working parents on your team they might appreciate help with childcare. On the other hand if your team is mostly college students they might appreciate a flexible PTO policy – especially around exam time. To start gathering mental health-care-specific benefits feedback you can:

Create an anonymous poll about your existing health-care plan.

Ask questions about how much employees value your current coverage. These responses give you fuel to potentially reduce coverage to exclude unused services or even change carriers to expand coverage next enrollment period.

Create an anonymous “sleep better at night” survey.

Build a survey filled with open-ended questions that let employees share their top stress-makers. Whatever their responses you have fuel to add meaningful benefits to help alleviate employee stress and improve wellness job satisfaction and retention rates.

3. Rethink your PTO policy.

Small businesses often practice lean staffing principles to reduce costs. So when an employee is out for any reason you have limited opportunities to backfill a shift. However lean staffing and PTO policies that boost employee mental wellness don’t have to be mutually exclusive.

Consider these steps to overhaul your current PTO policies:

Eliminate sick days.

A sick day policy tells your employees they must be physically unwell to take a day off. Consider shifting to a policy where you offer a certain number of PTO days per year that employees can use for any reason.

Implement a flexible PTO policy.

Employees are used to having to accrue days off but consider a flexible PTO policy from day one. By offering a pool of days to all employees to use at any time without an accrual hurdle you can let employees know they’re all equally valued and that certain employees aren’t more valuable than others.

4. Consider mental health-care apps and group solutions.

Could apps truly transform your mental health-care benefits package? On their own likely not but combined with other efforts on this list perhaps. Wanda Tompkins director of operations at Theara – a company focused on helping neurodiverse adults better engage with one another and their environments – encourages companies to explore the potential benefits of tech for employee mental wellness.

You can offer premium subscriptions to popular wellness apps at a low annual cost and employees get the benefit of private moments to focus on their wellbeing. Some popular apps with small-business solutions include:

Calm for Business. The app offers a wide range of guided meditations masterclasses and sleep stories.

Talkspace for Business. This chat-based app lets employees text with a mental health-care professional.

Twill for Business. This tool integrates with your existing health-care plan to offer added benefits like guiding employees to the mental health-care solutions they need.

You could also offer access to virtual support groups that give employees access to therapist-led group counseling sessions. Dr. Patrick Rowley a licensed counselor at Sesh which offers group support for individuals and businesses says the company’s research found that “50% of employee users reported improved productivity and 100% reported improved attitude and outlook after attending a mental health support session.”

5. Seek local solutions.

Your local community can also help your small business connect employees with licensed therapists – and at no cost to you.

Dr. Janelle S. Peifer a licensed clinical psychologist encourages small-business owners to reach out to small group therapy practices in their area.

“One of the often overlooked affordable and tailored mental health benefit options is contracting with a small group practice in your area” she says. “Small-business owners are able to negotiate individual contracts for their employees to get a set number of sessions often at a fraction of the cost of a larger insurance plan.” Peifer says that you can set up similar plans at two separate practices so employees have more choices where to go for care.

Beyond counseling think back to the specific stressors your employees shares in your “sleep better at night” surveys. Peifer’s local business solutions can apply to multiple local business types like childcare facilities family fun centers and more – it’s all about what helps your employee sleep better and enjoy their waking hours even more.

6. Lead by example.

Finally as small-business owners you can – at no cost – take meaningful action to improve companywide mental wellness by leading by example. A few small actions on your part can reinforce the importance your company places on mental wellness.

Skip the weekend emails.

When you stop sending those emails employees can stop stressing about missing an important message from you.

Leave for lunch.

If you leave your desk for lunch your employees see that they can leave their desks too. You can even consider weekly group lunch outings to encourage the “no lunch at your desk” policy.

Be gracious about personal calls.

Everyone’s kids spouse or parent happens to ring in occasionally during the workday. When this happens to you while in a conversation with an employee try saying “This is my spouse. I’ll be back with you in a moment” and take the call. Showing who you value lets your team know it’s okay to openly make time for those they value too.

Reinforce the importance of a good night’s sleep.

Whether through a “no meetings before noon” policy or letting employees enjoy flexible start times during a specified hour range (say 8 a.m. to 10 a.m.) it’s easy to remind folks that great sleep and great work go hand in hand.

Whether belting out her popular songs on stage being her true self on TV or regaining the reigns to her business The Jessica Simpson Lifestyle Collection she listens to her gut instincts takes time for herself and leads with small steps that build confidence. In a recent Office Hours episode Simpson explained that it’s really those small wins that matter most – especially when something seems impossible.

In 2021 Simpson took a larger leap: she bought back her namesake billion-dollar brand from the licensing company that previously owned a majority stake. Now she’s using her strength and authentic voice to guide the Jessica Simpson Lifestyle Collection into a label that encourages people to lead happy confident inspired lives.

Here’s how Simpson used her intuition to take back control of her business and make it shine even brighter than before – one step at a time.

There’s beauty in making small goals because once you achieve them you gain more confidence. Your next goal can be bigger. It’s those small accomplishments that give you value within yourself.

—Jessica Simpson owner The Jessica Simpson Lifestyle Collection

1. Trusting Her Ideas

The idea for launching a fashion brand started with Jessica’s music TV and film career. Fans loved Jessica’s style choices especially her Daisy Dukes and cowboy boots after playing Daisy in the “Dukes of Hazzard” movie as well as her casual outfit choices on the TV show “Newlyweds.” Whatever Jessica naturally felt like wearing her fans wanted to wear it too. Even in her #1 Billboard song “With You” Jessica sang about feeling beautiful wearing a T-shirt.

“It’s nice to be glam but also good to see what’s behind the glamorous” Simpson said. “If you can make a T-shirt glamorous that’s who I am – that’s the DNA of fashion for me.”

At that time most celebrity brands were collaborations rather than solo ventures she noted. Her team which included her parents didn’t know if having a fashion brand would work. But Simpson already a style icon also found inspiration from the styles she saw fans wearing while on tour. Being observant and connecting to her fans proved powerful and she built the brand into a shoe clothing and handbag staple that reflected her own style and her community of fans.

“Most of the time I feel like if you’re focusing on who your audience is those people are the ones that relate to you” Simpson said. “I didn’t know it would be what it is today – that we’d still be going so strong – and that I’d one day be able to own it all. We win when we’re authentic to who we are.”

2. Taking Care of Herself First

To make sure she listens to herself Simpson sets aside time for journaling. That has helped her find her voice both personally and professionally and even led her to write the New York Times best-selling memoir “Open Book” she said.

“It was really to let you in on who I am and who I always have been – growing up the challenges I’ve faced the pain I’ve gone through. You can see all the stories of my life woven to get to where I’m at right now” Simpson said.

With health and wellness a key part of her life Simpson wants to expand her namesake brand to offer products that help people lead healthier lives – both inside and out.

“I want people to feel great – I want people to love themselves” Simpson said. “I want people to have that confidence to go out there and do the things they want to do but they think they’re not good enough for.”

3. Celebrating the Small Steps

Celebrating small wins is important in reaching larger goals according to Simpson. It’s how she’s built her successful career so far.

“I’ve always set small goals in my life” she said. “There’s beauty in making small goals because once you achieve them you gain more confidence. Your next goal can be bigger. It’s those small accomplishments that give you value within yourself.”

It’s also important to pause and listen when you feel inspired she added. That helps you find the next great idea to work toward.

Ultimately trusting your voice and purpose taking care of yourself and following through even in small steps can lead to success. Being authentic throughout every step is the most important thing according to Simpson.

“You can’t be a leader if you’re afraid to be yourself. You can’t be a business owner if you’re afraid to be authentic” she said. “Fear has to be set aside. It’s taken a long time for me to own the Jessica Simpson Collection. Now that I have the power to own that there are so many things we want to do.”

Next the brand will evolve into a larger lifestyle company with health and wellness products home goods and more on the way. Wherever the road goes it will be fully true to Simpson and her unique vision. “Purpose outrides insecurity and there is so much purpose in everything that I do” she said."

Trump signed into law the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (the ""HFCAA""). This law is just one measure among many that have been promulgated by legislative and regulatory authorities in the United States (""US"") amid a backdrop of increasingly heightened scrutiny of US-listed China-based companies (""Chinese Listcos""). The HFCAA in particular threatens to cause delisting of Chinese Listcos from US securities exchanges and prohibit trading of their securities in the US ""over-the-counter"" (""OTC"") market by 2024 if not earlier.

As a result many Chinese Listcos are exploring alternate listings outside the US. The impact of US regulators' increased scrutiny on Chinese Listcos combined with current market conditions also make these issuers ripe targets for going private proposals from controlling shareholders and/or other market participants. A third possible pathway for Chinese Listcos could be voluntary delisting and deregistration in the US (i.e. going dark). In this article we highlight some key features of the HFCAA and discuss some of the key legal considerations around the potential consequences and outcomes for Chinese Listcos.

1. The HFCAA

Under the HFCAA and its implementing rules reporting issuers that are identified by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") as matching certain criteria for three consecutive years would be subject to trading restrictions and additional disclosure obligations.

a. How does the HFCAA operate?

i. Singling out Commission-Identified Issuers: The criteria used by the SEC for identifying the issuers subject to the HFCAA center on whether the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the ""PCAOB"") (the body overseeing the audits of public companies in the US) has determined that the auditors of these issuers were not subject to full PCAOB inspection or investigation. More specifically the so-identified issuers (""Commission-Identified Issuers"") comprise any US-listed company who has retained an auditing firm with a branch or office that (i) is located in a foreign jurisdiction; and (ii) the PCAOB determines it is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in that jurisdiction. Since the enactment of the HFCAA the PCAOB has made jurisdiction-wide determinations in respect of auditing firms headquartered in (i) mainland China; and (ii) Hong Kong covering all PCAOB-registered auditing firms in both jurisdictions. In March 2022 as companies started to file their annual reports (together with the required audit reports) the SEC began to identify numerous Chinese Listcos as Commission-Identified Issuers—156 Chinese Listcos conclusively and six Chinese Listcos provisionally as of the date of this article.1 Under the HFCAA the SEC will repeat this exercise for annual reports filed for fiscal years 2022 and 2023.

ii. Trading prohibition: After a company is conclusively identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer by the SEC for three consecutive years the SEC will issue an order prohibiting the trading of its securities on any US securities exchange or the OTC market which will become effective four business days thereafter. Therefore for a company that is a Commission-Identified Issuer for fiscal years 2021 2022 and 2023 (based on its annual reports filed in 2022 2023 and 2024 respectively) the earliest any trading prohibition would apply would be in 2024. However the US Senate has passed a bill to accelerate the timeline under the HFCAA from three years to two years and a similar bill has been introduced in the US House of Representatives.2 If either of these bills were to be signed into law trading bans could occur as early as 2023.

iii. Delisting: Although the HFCAA does not mandate that securities subject to trading bans be delisted and while neither NYSE nor NASDAQ has issued any statement in relation to the treatment of the securities of the Commission-Identified Issuers we fully expect stock exchanges will delist Commission-Identified Issuers once trading bans are imposed. Under applicable exchange rules for NYSE and NASDAQ3 if the relevant stock exchange has determined (at its discretion) that an issuer's continued listing raises public interest concerns they can delist the issuer. For example in 2021 NYSE delisted China Mobile Limited on the basis that it was no longer suitable for continued listing.4

b. What additional disclosure is required for Commission-Identified Issuers?

Once so identified a Commission-Identified Issuer must submit documents annually (prior to its annual report) evidencing that it is not owned or controlled by a governmental entity in its auditing firm's jurisdiction.

In addition a Commission-Identified Issuer must disclose in its annual report for each year that it is so identified: (i) the accounting firm that has prepared its audit report; (ii) the percentage of its shares owned by governmental entities in the foreign jurisdiction in which it is incorporated or organized; (iii) whether governmental entities in the same foreign jurisdiction as the issuer's accounting firm have a controlling financial interest in it; (iv) the name of any official of the Chinese Communist Party who is a member of the board of directors of the issuer or any of its operating entities including if there are any variable-interest entities (""VIEs"") among its operating entities; and (v) whether the articles of incorporation of the issuer (or equivalent organizational documents) contain any charter of the Chinese Communist Party including the text of any such charter.5

c. What is the status of regulatory discussions around PCAOB inspection?

Regulators in China and the US are discussing possible resolutions to the impasse between the PCAOB and Chinese auditing firms. Practitioners remain optimistic that a suitable resolution will be achieved but it remains to be seen whether an agreement will be reached before the clock runs out for Commission-Identified Issuers.

Calling for continued China-US cooperation on audit oversight China's primary securities regulatory agency the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the ""CSRC"") was recently reported to have indicated that ""positive progress"" had been made in talks on regulatory cooperation with US regulators.6 The CSRC issued a new draft rule regarding access to information by overseas regulators in April 2022 which appears to remove some obstacles to the oversight the PCAOB desires by providing that inspection or investigation of a Chinese Listco by overseas securities regulators and other competent authorities may be conducted ""under cross-border regulatory cooperation"" with CSRC and other Chinese government authorities providing necessary assistance.7 There have also been reports that Chinese regulators have informed auditing firms and Chinese Listcos to prepare for PCAOB inspections.8

On the other hand the PCAOB commented on May 24 2022 that market speculation about an imminent deal between the PCAOB and the CSRC was ""premature.""9 Recently YJ Fisher the Director of the SEC's Office of International Affairs expressed similar cautious sentiment in a public speech and stated that the US and Chinese authorities are engaging in constructive discussions but it remains uncertain as to whether the PCAOB and Chinese authorities will reach an agreement.10 Furthermore even if an agreement is reached by the PCAOB and Chinese authorities the PCAOB would need to determine that it can complete inspections and investigations before any reassessment of its 2021 determination on non-compliant jurisdictions.

2. Alternative listing on the HKSE

Facing uncertainties on a resolution of the PCAOB issue and potential delisting risk Chinese Listcos are actively exploring alternative listing venues and have sought secondary or dual-primary listings where permitted. Given the nexus between Hong Kong and mainland China the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (the ""HKSE"") has been a natural option for many such Chinese Listcos. Based on our search of public records after signing of HFCAA 12 Chinese Listcos have completed a dual-primary listing or a secondary listing on the HKSE making it the most popular dual listing venue for Chinese Listcos.

To qualify for a dual-primary or secondary listing on the HKSE Chinese Listcos will typically first need to qualify as a ""Grandfathered Greater China Issuer"" which is defined under the HKSE listing rules (the ""Listing Rules"") as a company with its center of gravity in Greater China and was listed on NYSE NASDAQ or the London stock exchange (a ""Qualifying Exchange"") on or before December 15 2017 or for companies with weighted voting rights (""WVR"") on or before October 30 2020.11

a. What is a dual primary listing on the HKSE?

With a dual-primary listing on the HKSE Chinese Listcos could concurrently list their shares on the HKSE in addition to their listing and registration in the US. The holders of American depositary shares (""ADS"") of a dual-primary listed issuer could cause their ADSs to be converted into the ordinary shares and traded on the HKSE. If these Chinese Listcos delist in the US it would not affect their primary listing status on the HKSE.

A dual-primary listing on the HKSE has the same listing requirements applicable to an IPO in Hong Kong. In addition Chinese Listcos may pursue a dual-primary listing retaining their existing WVR and/or VIE structures as long as they can among others (a) demonstrate that it is an ""innovative company"" (e.g. operating internet related or other high-tech businesses);12 (b) have a track record of good regulatory compliance of at least two full financial years on a Qualifying Exchange;13 and (c) have (i) a market capitalization of at least HK$40 billion; or (ii) a market capitalization of at least HK$10 billion and revenue of at least HK$1 billion for the most recent financial year.14 Chinese Listcos without any WVR or VIE structures do not need to demonstrate that they are an innovative company in their dual-primary listing but would otherwise need to satisfy the listing qualifications under the Listing Rules. In addition if Chinese Listcos adopt US GAAP in their financial reports they will be required to provide a reconciliation statement to HKFRS or IFRS in their financial statements in the listing documents accountants' reports as well as any annual and interim reports.15

b. What is a secondary listing on the HKSE?

The HKSE codified the qualifications and requirements for secondary listings for overseas issuers in 2018 which include Chinese Listcos whose jurisdiction of incorporation is not Cayman Islands Bermuda Hong Kong or the PRC. For an issuer with a center of gravity in Greater China to qualify for a secondary listing on the HKSE the issuer must have either: (a) a HK$3 billion market capitalization with a track record of good regulatory compliance for five full financial years on a Qualifying Exchange; or (b) a HK$10 billion market capitalization with a track record of good regulatory compliance for two full financial years on a Qualifying Exchange.16 The compliance track record requirements may be waived if the company is well-established and has a market capitalization significantly larger than HK$10 billion.17 A Chinese Listco with WVR will also need to meet the ""innovative company"" requirement and the same compliance track record and market capitalization/revenue test required for a dual-primary listing to maintain its WVR in connection with a secondary listing on the HKSE.18

Similarly a secondary listed issuer's ADS holders could cause their ADSs to be converted into the ordinary shares and traded on the HKSE at any time. If these Chinese Listcos subsequently delist in the US they would need to effect a primary conversion through one of the three pathways discussed below to be primarily listed on the HKSE.

c. Why is a secondary listing preferred by Chinese Listcos and how can they convert from a secondary listing into a dual primary listing?

In general Chinese Listcos may have their equity securities (e.g. ordinary shares or deposit certificates) listed and traded on a US securities exchange and following a dual-primary listing or a secondary listing on the HKSE. The equity securities will trade on the US securities exchanges and the HKSE independently.

The main advantage of a secondary listing over a dual-primary one is that certain customary waivers and exemptions from compliance with the HKSE Listing Rules are available only for secondary listings. These include waivers from requirements concerning audit and remuneration committee establishment certain reporting and announcements and certain continuing disclosure obligations.19 As an issuer applying for a secondary listing on the HKSE it would be able to apply for customary waivers from compliance with certain listing requirements applicable to an IPO and the Hong Kong Takeovers Code. A Chinese Listco could achieve a listing on the HKSE more quickly and at lower cost through a secondary listing as compared to a dual-primary listing.

Conversion to a primary listing can occur in one of the following three ways: (i) voluntarily by submitting a primary conversion application to the HKSE with regard to the plan to carry out a primary conversion and any applicable waiver applications as a primary listed issuer; (ii) by delisting (either voluntarily or involuntarily) in its primary listing jurisdiction an issuer will be automatically treated as having its primary listing on the HKSE; or (iii) by trading migration if 55% or more of the trading volume by dollar value in the shares of a secondary-listed company takes place on the HKSE over the most recent financial year the company will be required to convert its listing to a primary listing on the HKSE.20 However as noted above following a conversion from a secondary listing to a primary listing on the HKSE waivers and exemptions that are applicable only to secondary listings will no longer be available and full compliance with the Listing Rules will be applicable following the migration.

3. Going private

The perfect storm of market conditions and the potential impact of the HFCAA has led to a rise in another common outcome for Chinese Listcos: ""going-private"" transactions. Many Chinese Listcos are controlled by one or a few founders or controlling shareholders who can unilaterally determine (or at least veto) any take-over transaction. This voting power has parlayed into an opportunity for controlling stakeholders who may team up with institutional investors looking to arbitrage depressed US valuations against a hopefully growing Asian market. Controllers typically achieve this by making an offer to the board of the Chinese Listco to acquire all of the shares not owned by them and if the offer is accepted and successful the issuer would delist and deregister its shares becoming a private company. As a proposed buyer is often an affiliate of the issuer these privatizations are conflict transactions around which certain legal and commercial conventions have developed often in ways that slightly diverge from counterpart practice in the US. We review some of the key features of these norms below.

a. What are some recent trends in going-private transactions of Chinese Listcos?

Overall going-private transactions involving Chinese Listcos have been on the rise since 2019 as shown in the below chart. We saw a strong rebound of going-private activities of Chinese Listcos since 2019 which continued in 2021 and the first half of 2022.



Please refer to the Appendix for more details on going-private transactions of Chinese Listcos that closed in 2020 2021 and the first half of 2022.

i. Targets remain mostly incorporated in Cayman Islands

The jurisdiction of incorporation of the target dictates many features of a going private transaction – the fiduciary duties of the directors litigation risk profile shareholder approval requirements and deal structuring options to name a few. Most Chinese Listcos have been incorporated in the Cayman Islands for a variety of reasons often related to administrative ease cost familiarity and tax. As a result many Chinese Listco going-private transactions have necessarily involved Cayman-incorporated issuers (approximately 74% of all such deals since 2020) and have thus continued to build on the accretion of legal norms and precedence for these types of transactions.

In the Cayman Islands a merger can be effected with shareholder approval comprising 2/3 majority of the votes cast on the resolution by the shareholders present and entitled to vote at a quorate meeting. Compared to most US jurisdictions where the threshold is typically a simple majority of all shares this ""super-majority"" threshold has generally been accepted as a sufficient threshold for participants in these conflict transactions without the need for an additional ""majority-of-the-minority"" condition which is a staple of market practice in the US. This additional condition serves largely to help ensure a lower standard of review by courts in the US when participants are invariably subject to stockholder litigation. For these Chinese Listcos this type of litigation has largely not been of concern. More importantly as a practical matter the controllers/buyers of these targets simply do not agree to cede the fate of what would otherwise be a foregone conclusion into the hands of others. One type of litigation however that has become ubiquitous in these transactions is the shareholder-initiated appraisal proceeding (discussed further below). Generally the impact of these at times significant appraisal proceedings will unlikely shift the selection of jurisdiction for future Chinese Listcos.

ii. Deal structure: one-step merger structure dominates

Going-private transactions are often structured as either a one-step or two-step merger:

One-step: the buyer and the target agree to a merger via typically a ""reverse triangular merger"" which results in the target becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the buyer subject to the requisite shareholder approval; and Two-step: the buyer as a first step launches a tender offer to the target's shareholders in which it will seek to acquire typically enough shares to allow it to definitively secure the requisite approval for a merger (often in the form of a ""short form"" merger which can be achieved by a simple written resolution by the buyer after acquiring those shares) followed by the second-step merger to cash out those shareholders who do not tender their shares in the offer.

The traditional wisdom in the US market is that a two-step transaction allows a buyer to complete an acquisition more quickly than a one-step transaction under certain but not all circumstances. Factors that affect this calculus include financing regulatory approval and capitalization.

Because Chinese Listcos often have controlling shareholder(s) who already hold the requisite voting power to effect a merger unilaterally there has generally been no need to acquire additional shares in a tender offer. These going-private transactions are also often highly leveraged a factor which cuts in favor of a one-step transaction. However for a brief period in the recent past tender offers were used by some buyers who already held the requisite vote to effect a one-step merger to acquire enough shares to effect a short-form merger (which requires approval by 90% of the votes cast for Cayman Island targets). This phenomenon was largely driven by participants seeking to obviate the dissenter playbook on account of an ambiguity as to whether dissenters' rights applied in such short-form transactions – an ambiguity which has since been clarified by the courts in favor of the arbitrage/hedge funds (i.e. dissenting shareholders).

The figures below depict (i) these trends of one-step vs. two-step mergers; and (ii) the time lapse between signing and closing for going-private transactions of Chinese Listcos between 2017 and 2022.

b. What are some key legal issues in going-private transactions of Chinese Listcos?

i. Appraisal rights proceedings

Since 2017 all Chinese Listco going-private transactions involving Cayman Islands incorporated targets have resulted in appraisal claims under the Cayman Islands ""fair value"" statute. What started as a niche market for arbitrage and hedge funds looking to capitalize on these transactions where typical US plaintiffs' actions could not has blossomed into a full-fledged cottage industry and more practically an unavoidable transaction expense for buyers.

Appraisal proceedings for Cayman-incorporated Chinese Listcos stole the spotlight in 2017 with the Grand Court in the Cayman Islands handing down the first judgment on the matter for a Chinese Listco in respect of Shanda Games ruling that the fair value of the shares at issue was more than double the merger price. Before then there had been only one other ruling in 2015 involving a non-Chinese company. Since Shanda Games there have been only a handful of participants that actually chose to litigate and therefore there have only been a handful of rulings. The majority of these claims have settled confidentially. Since 2015 there have been 29 petitions filed with the Grand Court and only five of these petitions have made it to trial and judgment by the Cayman court. To date all of these judgments have resulted in an uplift on the merger consideration (ranging from 1% to 80%). These judgments have not revealed any single rubric for how valuations are determined which are inherently expert-driven and singular to the facts and circumstances of each case. Often there has been a blended approach combining a variety of valuation methodologies including taking into account deal price trading price and a discounted cash-flow analysis.

The conventional advice is for parties to ensure the deal process is absolutely rigorous and fair as to (i) price and (ii) process. Notably where the approval of a transaction is a foregone conclusion and there is no vibrant market check process the fairness of deal process and pricing is naturally questioned and the probity of deal price or trading price as a factor in determining fair value is diminished; the inverse however has also been seen to be true.

The traditional legal protection for buyers has been to require a closing condition that not more than a certain percentage of shares have dissented. The condition theoretically will provide a buyer some leverage against a mounting dissenter bloc and potentially cap exposure but buyers have increasingly been less successful in negotiating these protections (the condition has been observed in roughly half of applicable deals in recent history with the threshold generally around 10%). We also do not see a correlation between having such a closing condition and the actual percentage of dissenting shares. While the concession may be argued as a quid pro quo for a buyer receiving absolute certainty in executing a deal some buyers may take a more practical view –– that they will end up waiving the condition anyway and may be able to trade the ask for more quantifiable benefits such as a better deal price.

ii. Consortiums

Sponsors typically form consortiums to undertake larger transactions and to spread the risk associated with a particular going-private transaction among multiple sponsors. Sponsor consortiums will need to address certain pre-signing and pre-closing matters in a going-private transaction including (i) financing allocations; (ii) transaction expense and breakup fee sharing; (iii) defaulting or leaving consortium members; (iv) regulatory approval; and (v) governance/control of the consortium (both pre- and post-deal).

Where management is also involved in the consortium as is common in the case of Chinese Listcos additional consideration should be given to how equity is ""rolled"" including alignment on tax planning and issues as between sponsors and management. The timing of any discussions between the consortium and other possible management participants as well as discussions regarding future employment terms compensation and benefits arrangements needs to be carefully considered in light of the fiduciary obligations of the target's board of directors as well as disclosure considerations for the transaction. To minimize conflicts of interest discussions are sometimes postponed until later in the process after price and other transaction terms have been finalized and in certain circumstances after receipt of shareholder approval.

iii. Special committees and deal dynamics

To date most going-private transactions involving Chinese Listcos (and in particular Cayman-incorporated ones) have followed a fairly well-defined paradigm in terms of deal structuring terms and process. Special committees which are formed in response to receipt of offers from an affiliate/controller of the target benefited from this consistency in several ways as there is a clear understanding of what both the market and their fiduciary duties would dictate. However as the market has grown and investors become more intertwined with the fabric of Chinese growth sole-founder controlled issuers will and have begun to be less prevalent in favor of jointly controlled enterprises between sponsors or sponsors and management. The shifting landscape may lead to differential dynamics for transactions in the future potentially opening the doors to features that may have been considered anathema to the traditional going-private transactions in recent memory – robust market checks interlopers or others.

iv. Public disclosure considerations

A potential buyer may have disclosure obligations under Regulation 13D if the buyer is (i) a more than a 5% ""beneficial owner"" (i.e. persons who have or share voting or dispositive power over the relevant securities) or (ii) a group of shareholders that collectively ""beneficially own"" more than 5% of a class of registered equity securities of the target. The SEC requires that a Schedule 13D amendment must be filed promptly after the buyer forms a ""plan"" to engage in a transaction or makes a proposal for a potential transaction which is not when a merger agreement is signed or a tender offer is commenced. A person who previously filed a Schedule 13G is generally required to file a Schedule 13D within ten days after it forms the intent to change or influence control of the target. Therefore sponsors need to consider the timing of making a proposal or participating in a buyer consortium taking account of these disclosure implications.

In the Schedule 13D the buyer must disclose information relating to its identity the source and amount of funds used to purchase the shares owned the purpose of the purchases any plans or proposals involving the target and any agreements or arrangements it has with respect to the shares. A party that has filed a Schedule 13D is required to amend it promptly to disclose any material (i.e. more than 1%) increase or decrease in the number of securities it beneficially owns or any change in its investment intent.

v. Regulatory approvals

Going-private transactions may implicate regulatory approval requirements in the US as well as regulatory requirements in China for Chinese Listcos. Outbound investments in offshore target assets by a Chinese investor is subject to a series of outbound investment approval filing and reporting requirements with applicable Chinese government authorities depending on the location and industry of the target assets the investment amount and the identity and ownership structure of the Chinese investor. An outbound investment made by Chinese individual investors through onshore or controlled offshore vehicles will be subject to the filing or reporting mechanisms of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM).

National security approval (including CFIUS) antitrust and other regulatory approvals that apply to going-private transactions are comparable with other private acquisitions but substantive antitrust concerns are less likely to arise because typically continuity of control will be maintained. However the increased scrutiny of regulatory bodies in the US of Chinese Listcos including developments in CFIUS enforcement as evidenced by a number of failed transactions such as Magnachip-Wise Road may result in possible concerns for less traditional going-private transactions (e.g. where the Chinese Listco has some operations outside of China) and certainly should be an area of focus for traditional cross-border acquirers looking to pursue a US public acquisition.

With the advent of more proactive regulators and expanding regulation seen across many jurisdictions beyond China and the US antitrust and foreign investment review implications across the target's geographic footprint will also warrant early attention when evaluating take-private transactions.

4. Going dark

Chinese Listcos can voluntarily delist their securities and deregister under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act"") provided they satisfy certain conditions. The most recent examples of Chinese Listcos going dark that we have seen include Didi Global Inc. and Huaneng Power Internal Inc. Both companies announced shareholders' approval for delisting and filed for delisting in June 2022.21

a. Delisting: Delisting refers to the withdrawal of listing from a US national securities exchange. To voluntarily delist an issuer needs to (i) provide a written notice to the relevant stock exchange announcing the intent to delist securities; (ii) publish a press release to provide notice of delisting and the intention and reasons for delisting (iii) for NYSE-listed issuers provide board resolutions authorizing the delisting; (iv) file a current report on Form 6-K (or equivalent) to announce the intention to delist and (v) file Form 25 with the SEC to complete the delisting process. Form 25 automatically becomes effective and delist the securities of an issuer after ten days of filing and terminates reporting obligations of such issuer under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act after 90 days of filing which is the reporting obligations by virtue of a class of securities being listed on a US national stock exchange.

b. Deregistration: Deregistration refers to the withdrawal from registration under the Securities Act and the termination of reporting obligations under the Exchange Act. Assuming they are qualified as foreign private issuers Chinese Listcos may rely on Rule 12h-6 of the Exchange Act to deregister through a streamlined process when they meet the following criteria: (i) having been a reporting company for at least one year and filed or submitted all Exchange Act reports required for this period (including at least one annual report); (ii) not having made a registered offering in the US for the past 12 months (with limited exceptions); (iii) having maintained a non-US listing which is its primary trading market that constituted at least 55% of its trading in a recent 12-month period; and (iv) (a) the average daily trading volume (the ""ADTV"") of the issuer's shares during a recent 12-month period must not be greater than 5% of the ADTV of the issuer's shares on a global basis; or (b) the issuer has fewer than 300 holders who are US residents or fewer than 300 holders worldwide on a date falling within 120 days of filing the requisite notice to the SEC; provided that there is a further 12-month waiting period if the issuer did not meet the 5% ADTV test when delisted.

5. Conclusion and outlook

As we are now in the second half of 2022 the regulatory landscape and scrutiny over Chinese Listcos are still developing and the forecast following this perfect storm remains unclear. While there is some measured optimism in the air it remains paramount for Chinese Listcos and their advisors to continue to carefully assess potential options and their implications with vigilance. With more than 150 Chinese Listcos having been conclusively identified as Commission-Identified Issuers in 2022 it is certainly high time that Chinese Listcos consider their options and prospects of continued listing in the US and prepare to respond to further developments with utmost preparation. Across various market and regulatory factors conditions are ripe for going-private transactions to be on the rise again in the second half of 2022 and in 2023.

Although the number of Brazilian immigrants in the United States has been on the rise for the past four decades the magnitude and geographies of these flows have made the past decade unique.

Beginning in 2012 Brazil entered an economic downturn accompanied by high unemployment. At the same time the country began to witness rising crime highly publicized corruption scandals and growing political volatility. This compounded with the steep appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that have left a growing share of Brazilians food insecure has made the United States an increasingly attractive destination. The Brazilian immigrant population in the United States rose nearly 50 percent between 2010 and 2019 growing from 340000 to 502000.

Brazilians have increasingly sought to enter the United States through its border with Mexico. While U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) registered about 3100 apprehensions of Brazilians along the southern border in fiscal year (FY) 2016 the number of encounters jumped to a record high of nearly 57000 in FY 2021. The number of Brazilians apprehended by Mexican immigration authorities increased from around 300 in 2016 to nearly 17000 in 2021.

In response to these growing numbers and pressure from the U.S. government the Mexican government in December 2021 began requiring Brazilians to obtain tourist visas to enter Mexico. There was a steep drop initially in CBP encounters of Brazilians at the southern border after implementation of the visa requirement from about 7900 in December 2021 to 1300 in March 2022. However the numbers are once again rising having reached 4800 in May and are likely to continue to increase at least in the short term.

Brazilians now represent just over 1 percent of the 44.9 million immigrants in the United States as of 2019 continuing a pattern of immigration that began in 1980 when 41000 Brazilian immigrants lived in the United States. By 1990 the figure had doubled and reached 212000 at the turn of the century before more than doubling again over the next two decades.

Figure 1. Brazilian Immigrant Population in the United States 1980-2019 Sources: Data from U.S. Census Bureau 2010 and 2019 American Community Surveys (ACS); Campbell J. Gibson and Kay Jung ""Historical Census Statistics on the Foreign-born Population of the United States: 1850-2000"" (Working Paper No. 81 U.S. Census Bureau Washington DC February 2006) available online.

The United States is now home to the largest Brazilian immigrant population in the world. Brazilians also reside in Japan (205000) Portugal (154000) and Italy and Spain (approximately 133000 each) according to mid-2020 estimates from the United Nations Population Division. Brazil’s neighbors Paraguay (80000) and Argentina (49000) hosted the largest number of Brazilian migrants in South America.

Most Brazilian immigrants in the United States are not U.S. citizens and those who gained permanent resident status (also known as a green card) in FY 2020 mainly relied on family or employer sponsorship. Compared to both the foreign- and U.S.-born populations Brazilian immigrants have higher levels of educational attainment and higher household incomes. However they experience poverty and lack health insurance at higher rates than the U.S.-born population.

Using data from the U.S. Census Bureau (the 2019 American Community Survey [ACS] as well as pooled 2015-19 ACS data) the Department of Homeland Security’s 2020 Yearbook of Immigration Statistics and World Bank annual remittance data this Spotlight provides information on the Brazilian immigrant population in the United States focusing on its size geographic distribution and socioeconomic characteristics.

Distribution by State and Key Cities

Half of all Brazilian migrants resided in three states as of the 2015-19 period: Florida (22 percent) Massachusetts (17 percent) and California (11 percent). The top five counties with Brazilian immigrants were Middlesex County in Massachusetts along with four counties in Florida—Broward Miami-Dade Orange and Palm Beach. Together the five counties were home to 24 percent of Brazilian immigrants in the United States.

The U.S. cities with the largest number of Brazilian immigrants were the greater Boston (13 percent) Miami (13 percent) and New York (12 percent) metropolitan areas. Over one-third of all Brazilian immigrants resided in these three metro areas.

English Proficiency

In 2019 43 percent of Brazilian immigrants ages 5 and older reported having limited English proficiency a rate slightly lower than the total foreign-born population (46 percent). Still a slightly smaller share of Brazilian immigrants reported speaking only English at home (11 percent) than the total immigrant population (16 percent).

Note: Limited English proficiency refers to those who indicated on the ACS questionnaire that they spoke English less than “very well.”

Age Education and Employment

In 2019 the median age of Brazilian immigrants was 39 lower than that of the overall foreign-born population (age 46) but slightly higher than that of the U.S.-born population (age 37). A greater share of Brazilian immigrants is of working age (between ages 18 and 64) than the overall immigrant population at 85 percent and 78 percent respectively (see Figure 4). Both populations were far more likely to be in the 18-64 age group than the U.S.-born population (59 percent). This higher workforce participation by Brazilians reflects the economic motivation many have in coming to the United States.

Figure 4. Age Distribution of U.S. Residents by Origin 2019 Source: MPI tabulation of data from U.S. Census Bureau 2019 ACS.

Compared to the overall foreign- and U.S.-born adult populations Brazilian immigrants have a higher level of educational attainment. In 2019 44 percent of Brazilian immigrant adults (ages 25 and older) held a bachelor’s degree or higher compared to 33 percent for both the total immigrant and U.S.-born populations. A slightly greater share of Brazilian immigrants (17 percent) had graduate or professional degrees than all immigrant adults (14 percent) and U.S.-born adults (13 percent).

According to the Institute of International Education about 14000 international students from Brazil were enrolled in U.S. higher education institutions in the 2020-21 school year. Although this represents a relatively small share of the 914000 foreign nationals studying in the United States Brazil ranked eighth among sending countries. It was also the largest country of origin from Latin America and the Caribbean representing almost 20 percent of all students from the region studying in the United States.

Brazilian immigrants participated in the civilian labor force at a higher rate (70 percent) than both the overall foreign-born population (67 percent) and the U.S.-born population (62 percent) in 2019. A large share of Brazilians was employed in management business science and arts occupations followed by those employed in service occupations (see Figure 5).

Figure 5. Employed Workers in the U.S. Civilian Labor Force (ages 16 and older) by Occupation and Origin 2019 Source: MPI tabulation of data from U.S. Census Bureau 2019 ACS.

Income and Poverty

Brazilian immigrants tend to have higher median household incomes than both the overall immigrant and U.S.-born populations. In 2019 Brazilian immigrants had a median household income of about $68000 while U.S.-born households reported a median income of $66000 and all immigrant households $64000. At the same time Brazilian immigrants experienced poverty at a higher rate (15 percent) than the U.S.-born population (12 percent) but at a relatively similar rate to the overall immigrant population (14 percent).

Immigration Pathways and Naturalization

Immigrants from Brazil are considerably less likely than the overall immigrant population to be naturalized U.S. citizens. As of 2019 just 35 percent of Brazilian immigrants had become U.S. citizens compared to 52 percent of the total foreign-born population. This lower rate of citizenship acquisition is in part a reflection of the recency of Brazilians’ arrival with 47 percent entering in 2010 or later. For comparison 25 percent of all immigrants arrived during the same period (see Figure 6). It also is due to the pattern of circular migration that existed for many Brazilians who viewed their U.S. sojourn as a temporary stay. That trend may be changing however as increasing numbers of Brazilians appear to be leaving their native country with no intention of returning.

Figure 6. Brazilian and All Immigrants in the United States by Period of Arrival 2019 Source: MPI tabulation of data from U.S. Census Bureau 2019 ACS.

In FY 2020 nearly 17000 Brazilians gained legal permanent residence (also known as getting a green card). Of this group 53 percent did so through familial ties as spouses children or parents of U.S. citizens or through other family-sponsored preferences and another 44 percent became permanent residents through employer sponsorship. Virtually no Brazilians received green cards as humanitarian migrants (see Figure 7).

Figure 7. Immigration Pathways of Brazilian and All Lawful Permanent Residents in the United States FY 2020 Notes: Immediate relatives of U.S. citizens include spouses minor children and parents of U.S. citizens. Family-sponsored preferences include adult children and siblings of U.S. citizens as well as spouses and children of green-card holders. The Diversity Visa lottery was established by the Immigration Act of 1990 to allow entry to immigrants from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States. The law states that 55000 diversity visas in total are to be made available each fiscal year. Individuals born in Brazil were not eligible for the 2023 lottery.

Unauthorized Immigrant Population

There were approximately 178000 unauthorized immigrants from Brazil living in the United States in 2019 according to Migration Policy Institute (MPI) estimates. They represented less than 2 percent of the estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the country. Key destinations included Broward County Florida (12000 unauthorized Brazilians); Fairfield County Connecticut (9000); and Orange County Florida (8000).

As of March 2022 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) reported that 4640 Brazilians were beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program representing the seventh largest country of origin among beneficiaries. Of the 611270 current DACA recipients less than 1 percent were born in Brazil. The DACA program provides temporary protection from deportation and work authorization.

Health Coverage

Brazilian immigrants were more likely to be uninsured than both the overall immigrant and U.S.-born populations. In 2019 26 percent of Brazilian immigrants were uninsured compared to 20 percent of all foreign-born persons and 8 percent of all U.S.-born persons. Brazilian immigrants held private health insurance at roughly the same rate (57 percent) as the overall immigrant population (58 percent) but were less likely to have public coverage than all immigrants (see Figure 8).

Figure 8. Health Insurance Coverage for the U.S. Population by Nativity 2019 Note: The sum of shares by type of insurance is likely to be greater than 100 because people may have more than one type of insurance.

Diaspora

The Brazilian diaspora in the United States is comprised of approximately 684000 individuals who were born in Brazil or reported Brazilian ancestry according to tabulations from the 2019 ACS. It is not among the top 20 diasporas in size.

Remittances

Brazil received $3.6 billion in remittances from individuals in countries around the world via formal measurable channels in 2020 up from $3.2 billion in 2019 according to data from the World Bank (see Figure 9). The size of global remittances sent to Brazil in 2020 was 164 percent larger than in 2000. Remittances accounted for just 0.2 percent of Brazil’s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020.

Members of the U.S. Congress are lobbying Secretary of State Antony Blinken to make the listing and both the Senate and the House of Representatives – the higher and lower congressional houses – have introduced resolutions calling on him to do so with Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi describing the designation as “long overdue”. This advocacy follows vigorous efforts by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy since April to get Congress and the White House on board with the idea. Thus far Secretary Blinken has resisted the pressure but the introduction of a bill by House members that would designate Russia indicates that the issue is still alive (though at present there appears to be little support for moving forward legislatively). Should the U.S. make this designation Russia would join a very small group of countries on a list that the U.S. government has traditionally reserved for those nations it considers pariahs – a designation that by all appearances is often based at least as much on overall enmity as on a country’s specific relationship to terrorism. The list presently includes Cuba Iran Syria and North Korea; past designees have included Sudan Libya and Iraq. The reason for the push is clear: civil society groups opinion leaders and politicians in the U.S. have urged Washington to levy additional penalties in response to its massive February invasion of Ukraine. The calls grow louder as the war drags on and as journalists and civil society groups circulate graphic well-documented accounts attributing atrocities to Russian forces in Ukraine. Proponents of the state sponsor of terrorism designation hope it will further stigmatise and isolate Russia for launching a brutal war on its neighbour. But the concrete implications of a designation could be highly counterproductive – narrowing space for diplomacy if and when the moment for peace talks arrives driving up already dangerously high tensions and impeding multilateral efforts to address conflict situations and humanitarian crises around the world. How States Are Designated and Why it Matters Congress has delegated to the secretary of state substantial discretion to designate a state as a sponsor of acts of international terrorism. Designation requires the secretary to make a determination that a state has “repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism”. The three statutes that provide authority to make these designations do not comprehensively define “international terrorism” although other legislation provides some idea of the parameters that apply. There is no requirement that the secretary of state designate every country that meets the relevant criteria or even that the states on the list be the most significant sponsors of international terrorism at a given time. Given the flexibility created by this statutory framework policy and domestic political considerations seemingly including some unrelated to counter-terrorism appear to weigh heavily in the designation decision. The designation of Cuba on the basis of questionable links to terrorism per se is widely considered to be such an example.

State sponsor designations are highly consequential both legally and politically and for this reason Washington typically avoids listing states with which it has multifaceted relations.

State sponsor designations are highly consequential both legally and politically and for this reason Washington typically avoids listing states with which it has multifaceted relations. Indeed what Cuba and the other three currently listed states have in common is that the U.S. has no formal diplomatic or commercial ties with them. In each of these four cases very poor relations preceded the state-sponsorship listing and in all four the designation has been a further source of friction. As Ingrid Wuerth has explained a state sponsor of terrorism designation implicates two areas of law sanctions and sovereign immunity. It triggers export controls for dual-use items – materials with both civilian and military uses; disallows U.S. arms sales and foreign assistance; and restricts access to debt relief and international financing. It also prompts other restrictions which are unspecified in the statutes but which in other cases have coincided with increasingly severe sanctions that wind up applying to the entire economy and population of the listed country. The designation can trigger application of other miscellaneous sanctions laws that penalise entities and individuals engaging in certain types of trade with the sanctioned state. Unlike the more widely used foreign terrorist organisation and specially designated global terrorist designations which focus on individuals and groups this designation applies at the level of the state. A state sponsor of terrorism designation also limits a designated state’s entitlement to immunity under U.S. law. While the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act generally shields foreign states from suits in U.S. courts it provides that U.S. nationals (as well as U.S. government employees contractors and service members) may sue designated countries for certain listed offenses including torture extrajudicial killing and hostage-taking. If they prevail they can claim their award from the designated state’s blocked assets. Past awards have been substantial (although they have for the most part not been distributed to victims); for example a court ordered Iran to pay nearly $9 billion to victims of the bombing of a U.S. Marine barracks in Lebanon and North Korea to pay more than $500 million to the family of student Otto Warmbier in connection with his hostage-taking torture and extrajudicial killing.

The designation can result in a range of ... nebulous but consequential effects.

In addition to the above penalties the designation can result in a range of other nebulous but consequential effects. In part because it has so long been applied to countries that the U.S. in effect deems outcasts the listing carries a greater stigma than other sanctions. U.S.-based businesses and non-governmental organisations may assume that any engagement with or in a designated state is off limits even for activities that are technically allowed. Non-U.S. firms may also be concerned that engagement will expose them to legal action in the U.S. especially if they have U.S.-based operations or personnel. Often firms find it difficult to obtain sufficient clarity on the legality of engagement to feel confident investing. Legal implications aside the reputational risks of being tied to a country formally designated by the U.S. as supporting terrorism are so high that many businesses steer clear of states with this label without investigating the technicalities. For example firms refused to re-engage with Sudan (which was designated as a state sponsor from 1993 to 2020) even after Washington lifted comprehensive economic sanctions in 2017 as part of a conscious effort to permit them to increase their activity there. Because the state sponsor designation remained on the books and with it a persistent chilling effect most businesses still deemed engagement too hazardous. Designations tend to stick partly because rescinding a country’s designation as a state sponsor of terrorism can be a politically fraught process with rigorous requirements. It requires the U.S. president to submit a report to congressional leaders affirming that the concerned state has either 1) undergone a fundamental change in leadership and policy ceased supporting acts of international terrorism and provided assurances that it will not abet such acts in the future or 2) refrained from supporting international terrorism during the preceding six-month period and provided assurances that it will not resume supporting them in the future. Congress can block a proposed rescission but only by introducing a joint resolution which the president can veto. (Congress can overcome the veto but doing so requires a two-thirds majority in both Houses which is an extremely high bar.) Past administrations removed Cuba Iraq Sudan and Libya from the list with congressional support although the Trump administration put Cuba back on it in 2021. The Flawed Case for Designation Those arguing for the U.S. to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism say doing so would send a powerful message of support to the Ukrainian government and people. While some proponents believe the move would be largely symbolic others predict it would have “severe” economic effects and see that as a reason to designate Russia arguing that such a drastic step may be the only tool strong enough to affect President Vladimir Putin’s behaviour. Both camps tend to agree that the U.S. should use every weapon in its non-military arsenal to punish Russia for its crimes in Ukraine. Many also hope that where avenues for accountability are lacking the legal routes that the designation opens for claimants in U.S. courts can be a first step toward securing justice for victims. While Russia’s actions in Ukraine are the impetus for their push advocates make a much broader case for designation. They argue that over the years Moscow can be viewed to have met the statutory requirements by consorting with groups engaged in political violence (whose actions would therefore constitute terrorism by some criteria) helping their supporters and engaging in activities that themselves should be seen as international terrorism. By way of evidence they point to the presence of Russian combat troops in and supporting Syria a designated state sponsor of terrorism; Russian development and support of separatists in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region since 2014; the alleged poisoning by Russian operatives of political enemies abroad; and Russia’s use of the Wagner Group a private security company accused of violence against civilians in Libya Sudan and elsewhere to further its foreign policy goals. Others have pointed to its conduct in prosecuting wars in Chechnya and Georgia. Proponents argue that with this track record Russia should have been designated a long time ago.

The concern ... is that [this designation] would establish a precedent and expose the U.S. and its partners to similar kinds of designations by adversaries in the future.

But the issues presented by the Russian situation are not so straightforward. While Secretary Blinken likely has the ability within the flexible parameters of the relevant authorities to designate Russia if he did so he would muddy U.S. practice concerning what it does and does not consider to be terrorism which already suffers from some inconsistency. (The struggle to define terrorism consistently is not unique to the U.S.) The traditional U.S. approach to terrorism-related designations typically distinguishes terrorism from the conduct of hostilities by state security services – which is at the core of much of the evidence cited above – even when such conduct might violate the laws of war. Such concerns partly explain the Pentagon’s resistance to designating Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a state organ as a foreign terrorist organisation under the Trump administration. The concern in this regard is that doing so would establish a precedent and expose the U.S. and its partners to similar kinds of designations by adversaries in the future. Stretching U.S. practice to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism could fuel Moscow’s claims of the designation’s illegitimacy and (for the reasons discussed below) could also make it more difficult to defend a rescission of the designation should the U.S. at some stage wish to take that step in order to advance a peace effort. It may also invite future pressure to use the designation authority on a broader range of states with all the risks that would entail. Implications for the Ukraine Conflict There is little to suggest that designating Russia a state sponsor of terrorism will dissuade Moscow from its current course in Ukraine or anywhere else. Russia is already enduring some of the most sweeping sanctions ever imposed – and the sanctions are still being ratcheted up. Western states have condemned Russia’s actions in Ukraine multilateral bodies have censured the Kremlin and the International Criminal Court is investigating possible war crimes. While the desire to find new ways to pressure Moscow into ending the war or deter it from committing further atrocities is entirely understandable there is little to suggest that this move will do either. But the designation could still have substantial impact – particularly should the parties reach the point where they are ready for peace talks. Unfortunately that impact could well be negative. While Western powers will likely be reluctant to rescind all of the sanctions they have applied since the first Ukraine invasion in 2014 Russia will almost certainly insist that some be rolled back and Crisis Group has recommended that Ukraine’s partners be prepared to take some measured steps. Synchronising sanctions relief with the terms of a future peace deal will already be extremely challenging but the state sponsor designation would add a big obstacle. Russia will surely want to see it rescinded as part of any deal both because of its symbolism and because its persistence would make even partial economic normalisation much more difficult. Yet the same symbolism would make rescission very difficult for the U.S. as demonstrated by the controversy over the possibility of dropping Iran’s Revolutionary Guards from the foreign terrorist organisation list. Domestic resistance to the lifting of that designation significantly complicated negotiations for the U.S. to return to the Iran nuclear deal. In the Ukraine conflict similar dynamics will almost certainly be at play. A U.S. presidential administration supportive of a future Russia delisting would have to win the support of a public whose impressions of the Kremlin would be shaped both by the atrocities committed in Ukraine and by the framing of Russia as a terrorist state. Even if it lacks the votes to block delisting Congress could create major political friction if it is not on board. If the U.S. stretches traditional parameters to make the designation based on a broad range of past Russian transgressions any removal will likely be judged by whether Russia has stopped meeting those expanded criteria. That will be a difficult bar to clear as the Kremlin is unlikely to radically change its behaviour. Given that other countries might follow Washington’s lead by issuing their own designations a delisting could be further encumbered by additional diplomatic coordination.

As part of any future peace deal Russia ... is likely to insist upon the unfreezing of some if not all of its assets.

Opening up the U.S. courts to lawsuits against Russia could also have negative implications for the Ukraine conflict. As part of any future peace deal Russia if it has any standing to do so is likely to insist upon the unfreezing of some if not all of its assets. That process would be much more complicated and potentially impossible if those assets were to be implicated in judicial awards or ongoing litigation. It is entirely possible that U.S. claimants will find a basis for pursuing legal action in the event Russia loses its sovereign immunity because of designation not least because U.S. citizens have been killed in Ukraine. Frozen Russian assets could become politicised with U.S stakeholders lobbying for their disbursement to U.S. victims instead of in service of a potential peace deal or reconstruction plan. As Wuerth has noted providing damages to U.S. nationals from frozen Russian assets could also deprive Ukrainian victims of a source for future compensation or reparations that might be awarded as part of a peace deal or by an international tribunal. A designation may also make it harder for actors to be nimble in striking arrangements like the UN-backed deal recently signed by Ukraine and Russia to facilitate grain exports. It could also undermine implementation of this and other similar arrangements if businesses and aid organisations fear that carrying or distributing Russian-sourced commodities exposes them to legal political and reputational risks. While such concerns may be addressed through the issuance of waivers such bureaucratic hurdles and perceived risks have traditionally had a chilling effect. Implications for International Peace and Security While designation would be intended to send a bracing signal of condemnation to Moscow the message it sends could have more troubling dimensions. Moscow will at one level find the designation deeply insulting not least because it views itself as at the forefront of countering terrorism. Thus the Russian foreign ministry has threatened to break off diplomatic relations with the U.S. if such a decision is taken. Even more worrying is the prospect that President Putin could regard this move as an overt call for a change in Russia’s government – particularly given that one of the two statutory paths to rescission involves a change in the designated country’s leadership. U.S. President Joe Biden has explicitly said that the U.S. is not looking to force Putin from power. Yet this designation would give Putin something concrete to point to in disputing that claim feeding his sense of grievance against the West and the related risk of confrontation.

Listing Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism would ... hamper international cooperation on global conflict and crisis management."

Two questions -- ""What is college for and who pays for it?"" -- form the foundation of a new book that explores a variety of systemic issues facing America's higher education system.

Will Bunch author of “After the Ivory Tower Falls: How College Broke the American Dream and Blew Up Our Politics – and How to Fix It” spoke to ABC News Live about the history of the student loan crisis and the future of the higher education system in America.

Will Bunch is the author of ""After the Ivory Tower Falls: How College Broke the American Dream and Blew Up Our Politics – and How to Fix It"" a book that explores systemic issues in higher education. ABC

Bunch said the issues stem back to World War II. After the war President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the G.I. Bill which provided veterans with funds for college education among other benefits.

As a result it made higher education a public good for millions of veterans and middle-class Americans Bunch said. “The question we've been trying to resolve for the last 75 years which is two questions: What is college for and who pays for it?”

As tuition steadily rose over the course of nearly a century soon 1 out of 5 adults couldn’t attend college without borrowing money according to Bunch. Now as inflation rises and a recession looms 1 in 5 Americans are holding on to student loan debt that has accrued to a national federal debt of over $1.7 trillion according to data from the Federal Reserve.

“The thing is to really succeed in this economy most job recruiters are looking for that credential a college diploma” said Bunch who shared the 1992 Pulitzer Prize for spot news reporting. “And so people feel they have no choice. They have to make this gamble of borrowing the money for college or the alternative could be worse.”

In his book Bunch spoke to a variety of people including college graduates who are struggling to manage six-figure loans and people who chose other alternatives to college.

Bunch said that people often believe what he says is an incorrect assumption that college is “available to all people” and so it’s assumed that those who do not have a degree within the system are seen as “deficient.”

“We believe in the value that education is available to all people but it's up to you to make the most out of that opportunity” said Bunch. “[Those who do not have a degree] are being told that… they have failed in life somehow by not getting this degree.”

Bunch said a viable solution would be to invest in other educational experiences in lieu of a college degree.

“Education after age 18.. it doesn't have to be in a university classroom. It could be a trade school it could be an internship it could be a gap year” he said. “But I think these opportunities for our young people should be public good.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNsaW1iaW5nLmNvbS9uZXdzL2VtaWx5LWhhcnJpbmd0b24tdGhlLWFtZXJpY2FuLXdheS1jb250cm92ZXJzeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Let's Discuss Emily Harrington and “The American Way” Controversy.,"Heading out the door?

On July 26 HBO released the third episode of its Edge of the Earth series in which pro climbers Emily Harrington and Adrian Ballinger battle up the northwest face of Pik Slesova also known as the Russian Tower. They’re trying to send The American Way (5.13a 950m VI) which was freed in 2019 by David Allfrey Brent Barghahn Nick Berry and Eric Bissell. Harrington and Ballinger each planned to claim individual first free ascents but (as you can see in the well-produced hour-long episode) there were challenges. And then a weeks-long online debate about big wall ethics followed. Things got heated.

On Instagram the day before the show released Allfrey wrote: “In regards to the new @HBO show ‘Life on the Edge’ @hbo @hbomax @emilyaharrington @adrianballinger claim ‘a first free ascent of Pik Slesova’ in which they climb a free route established and freed by @nikscaryberry @ericbissel @brentbarghan and I. We think they could have done better to represent the truth of their accomplishment a proud second ascent a first female ascent. But not in any way a First Free ascent.”

Others chimed in. What followed was a slew of other comments regarding the presentation of the accomplishment as well as questions about style and the accomplishment itself. Let’s dig in.

The Episode

If you haven’t seen the episode watch it. Harrington is as strong and honest and tenacious as ever and she and Ballinger contend some formidable obstacles from threats of terrorist activity to COVID to rockfall and then of course the difficulty of the route itself.

“It was one of those trips where literally everything seemed to be always falling apart and we couldn’t catch a break” writes Harrington in an email to Climbing. “It’s just like anything though you have to ‘train’ for such junkshows by remembering that in order to come out of it with even a shred of your sanity intact you have to let go of the things you can’t control and do your best with the things you can.”

In perhaps the most pivotal moment of the episode Harrington traverses through the sky having just climbed the majority of The Kyrgyz Monster pitch named after the Monster Offwidth on El Cap. She’s shaking dancing her weight from one foot to the other and back again. The final hold a jug rail is just out of reach and the truth is written all over her face: She does not have the energy to do the pitch again if she falls. But she pulls through because she’s a rock star. She gets scared she cries she tries really hard. In the end she’s just plain tough.

The Route

Kyrgyzstan’s Ak-Su Valley remained largely unknown to the climbing world until a Soviet party visited it in 1982. The valley is much like a remote Yosemite. Glacier-carved granite crests thousands of feet above a rippling floor. The rock goes on and on—Kyrgyzstan comprises one of the world’s most mountainous regions. As Soviet alpinists played in the region word spread and climbers from everywhere began traveling to the country. Unfortunately the area has been riddled with conflict since the 90’s. It was here that Tommy Caldwell Beth Rodden John Dickey and Jason Smith were kidnapped by militant rebels in 2000. The threat of violence has only recently diminished and with that climbers have begun returning to the extensive rock playground.

Roughly the size of El Cap Pik Slesova climbs over 3000-feet from its base. It houses the famous Perestroika Crack (5.12b) widely considered one of the best big wall crack climbs in the world free climbed in 1995 by Greg Child and Lynn Hill. In 1988 the steeper northwest face was first aid climbed by a Russian team who called their line the Moroz Route. Conrad Anker and Alex Lowe climbed the line seven years later with a few variations calling the alternate route the Russian Shield (VI 5.10 A4).

More than 20 years after that Berry Bissell Barghahn and Allfrey added different variations to the original Moroz Route doing a team free ascent of The American Way. (Team free just to be clear refers to the fact that not every member of the team climbed every pitch without aid; it’s a pretty standard way of doing big walls especially when dealing with the work and logistics of first ascents.) They spent four days aid climbing up Moroz Route fixing ropes up to the White Block Bivouac a large ledge about halfway up the wall. Then in a ground-up push they spent three days free climbing up to the ledge. From there they continued their push to the summit. In total they spent 18 days in the Valley and left behind rappel anchors and bolts placed as needed.

In 2021 when the episode was filmed Harrington and Ballinger went to Kyrgyzstan with the goal of completing first individual free ascents of The American Way—meaning that they each intended to free all the pitches another fairly common step in the continuum of big-wall climbing. Once arriving at the route (after many unforeseen delays—watch the episode!) the two spent a few days working the crux 5.13 second pitch which is conveniently accessible from basecamp. The weather cleared and they went for a ground-up push attempting each pitch in sequence. Harrington led everything 5.12b and harder as well as the runout loose and more dangerous moderate pitches. Ballinger led one 5.12a that he had worked on but largely due to time did not successfully free the whole route.

“It’s an incredible route” writes Harrington. “It had everything you want in a big wall free climb: hard face pitches thuggy offwidth long wandery and runout moderate pitches a beautiful summit. It rivals any free route on El Cap in terms of quality and awesomeness.”

The Selling of a Story

Trouble began even before the episode was released when various media outlets wrote headlines about how they had completed the first free ascent of The American Way leaving out the crucial word “individual.” Harrington and Ballinger worked swiftly to correct the headlines but not without more than a few climbers placing blame on them on social media for falsifying the story.

“The funny thing is that we went to great lengths to clarify and make sure the story was told accurately and fairly in terms of what was done (and who came before us) in the episode” writes Harrington. Within the first four minutes of the episode in fact a photo of the four first ascentionists is shown while the history is discussed.

“Admittedly we didn’t catch the first incorrect headline about us trying to do a first free ascent but that was apologized for and fixed immediately after we were made aware (there were others that we also got fixed but it took longer). Obviously we didn’t write that headline make any such claim nor did we have that much control over its publishing—the mainstream has been guilty of getting the subtle nuances of climbing wrong in every big story not just this one.”

Indeed this is not the first time Harrington’s accomplishments have been misconstrued by the media. Back in 2020 Harrington became the first woman to free climb El Cap’s Golden Gate route in a day. Many news outlets incorrectly headlined their articles “First Woman to Free Climb El Cap in a Day.” Of course Lynn Hill was the first to do that in 1994 and to follow were Steph Davis in 2004 and Mayan Smith-Gobat in 2011. This type of misreporting is not Harrington’s fault but rather the general population’s lack of understanding of our sport.

HBO’s Edge of Earth marketing didn’t help. The series comprising four episodes total features “four groups of elite action-adventure athletes embarking on never-before-accomplished missions” so reads the site’s page. This of course made things worse.

Francis Sanzaro Ph.D was the former editor-in-chief of Rock and Ice Gym Climber and Ascent now of GearLab speaks highly of Harrington in terms of her strength as an athlete and veracity of character. But he pointed out the inherent conceptions that come with the idea of “never-before-accomplished missions.”

“I think the modern public when they see ‘first’ they think of the first person who climbs a wall or gets up it. And I think that’s how my mom or dad watching the HBO special would interpret that you know? … It gives us a sense of true exploration. In terms of the popular definition of first this didn’t fit. But [Harrington and Ballinger] were trying to do a first particular type of free climbing which is very nuanced in the climbing world.”

It does all beg the question: how much responsibility do climbers have for controlling the media’s word choices? It is of course a two-way street between an athlete and a journalist and there’s abundant room on either side to intentionally or unintentionally tell the wrong thing.

Let’s Get Philosophical

In the long run to climbers the more important and resonant discussion lies with the accomplishment itself: First free individual ascent. It is the norm to define a free ascent as climbing each pitch without falling. But what about stylistic differences? Did you lead every pitch? Did someone haul your gear for you? Was protection already placed? Did you do it in sequence and ground up?

In November of last year U.K. alpinists Matt Glenn and Tom Livingstone made the first ascent of the Northeast Pillar of Tengkangpoche (6487 meters) in Nepal. The two used some gear that had been left on the mountain by Quentin Roberts and Jesse Huey the year before including a pair of jumars a daisy chain an aider 10 protein bars and three gas canisters. Should they have? And should the cache have been left there in the first place? What followed was a heated internet debate with no real easy conclusion. Importantly Glenn and Livingstone learned they should have disclosed the usage of the gear in the initial reporting of their ascent. While the two did in fact earn the coveted “first” the fact that they use stashed gear means there’s perhaps further room for someone else to come along and improve the style.

In 2017 Sasha DiGiulian Jon Cardwell and Marcus Garcia made the first free team ascent of the 15-pitch Misty Wall (5.13) in Yosemite. Initial headlines left Garcia out. In fact this Gripped article doesn’t make it clear that Garcia was one of the ascensionists. His role was to film or that was the plan but when two wide-crack climbs were wet he tapped in for the lead to help move the team along. So why was he left out of initial reports? The claim that DiGiulian and Cardwell wherever it originated made a team free ascent is false or at least incomplete since on that particular day they couldn’t have made it happen without Garcia. Clarifying who did what pitch and in what style is the only way to explain the full story and try to prevent false assumptions.

On the outset you might think doing an individual free ascent might help to get around all that. Climb every pitch yourself and no one can doubt your abilities on the route right? But that style too comes with its own set of nuances.

As Sanzaro points out in his article Who Did It First? Style Grades and Dispute in First Ascents Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson topped out El Capitan via the Dawn Wall in 2015. They both sent the crux pitches of the route however they swung leads on the remaining pitches and neither claimed an individual free ascent. Instead they gave that credit to Adam Ondra who in 2016 led every pitch himself. Defining an individual free ascent by lead-only is not the norm in big wall ethics but it is certainly an improvement in style.

Conversely in July Austrian legends Babsi Zangerl and Jacopo Larcher claimed a free ascent of Eternal Flame on the south face of Trango Tower in Pakistan. Like Harrington they each led the crux pitches and then swung leads on the rest.

“It makes a lot of sense to do it that way for efficiency reasons especially in the mountains where time and weather is a factor; but they each individually freed the route” says Harrington speaking of Zangerl and Larcher’s ascent. “Of course [in our case] leading all the pitches could be argued to be better style but that would have greatly detracted from Adrian’s experience and we felt like that was something to consider as well.”

Armchair philosophers of our sport should also remember this: A style improvement is a style improvement. Sometimes that’s the most important takeaway when discussing accomplishments as incremental steps are the only way to push the sport forward.

***

Ultimately there are no set rules in climbing. But as our sport grows and more money gets pumped into the system the stakes are higher. It’s increasingly important to discuss what definitions we wish to persist within our sport and the asterisks with which we want to separate the everyday ascents from the fantastic ones. We can mitigate misreporting and obfuscation by asking questions and requiring details. And we get to decide upon the ethics and definitions we wish to persist in our sport.

Also at the end of the day: the HBO episode featuring Harrington and Ballinger is truly a delight.

This winter the company will begin construction of a new water pipeline to supply Eureka with water from its St. Louis County system.

“We are honored to provide clean safe and reliable water and wastewater service to our new customers in Eureka” said Svindland. “Our team is looking forward to leveraging our experience and expertise to operate the water and wastewater systems efficiently and to begin the construction of a new pipeline to connect them to our high-quality drinking water.”

The City of Eureka began initial conversations with Missouri American Water in 2018. In August 2020 more than 66 percent of Eureka voters supported a ballot measure to sell the systems for $28 million and make the utility their trusted water and wastewater provider.

“Eureka has grown and with that the expertise and staffing required to run our systems greatly increased” said Eureka Mayor Sean Flower. “It became increasingly difficult to find staffing and expertise for a system of this size while meeting federal and state regulations. Since the public vote in 2020 we have waited for the opportunity to have Missouri American Water as our water and wastewater provider. The City of Eureka can now redeploy the proceeds of this sale to invest in our community.”

A key driver for the sale was Missouri American Water’s ability to connect the city with drinking water supplied from the Missouri River.

“We know that building the connection to our drinking water system in St. Louis County which draws from the Missouri River instead of groundwater wells is a top priority for Eureka residents and businesses” said Brian Eisenloeffel Senior Director of Operations. “We’ve completed the initial engineering work and now we’re excited to move forward with the construction phase of the project.”

Construction of the five-mile pipeline will be accomplished in three phases. The second and third phases are scheduled to begin next year and be completed in 2024.

Missouri American Water will also be making additional improvements to the water and wastewater systems. An audit of existing water meters has been conducted so new meters can be properly sized and upgraded for homes and businesses. The new Advanced Metering Infrastructure system which will be deployed throughout Eureka over the next two months will allow for potential leaks to be detected more quickly. The company has hired Eureka public works employees who are familiar with Eureka’s systems and will be onboarding and training them immediately.

Missouri American Water has committed to invest more than $37 million in the city’s water and wastewater systems over the next ten years to improve the city’s water quality upgrade aging infrastructure and maintain regulatory compliance.

The utility is working with city officials for a smooth transition of service. Customers will receive welcome packets by mail with important customer information. Customers can access the company’s online customer service portal MyWater which provides a one-stop-shop for viewing account details signing up for paperless billing and autopay reviewing service alerts and more.

HARRISBURG — Pennsylvania lawmakers are weighing legislation that would make it easier for private water companies to target municipal authorities for acquisition purchases that new research shows can lead to higher bills for consumers.

The proposal — sponsored by state Sen. Pat Stefano (R. Fayette) and backed by two large influential private utility companies — is billed by supporters as a way to increase the reliability quality and security of Pennsylvania’s water supplies.

It would require public water systems with more than 750 customers to develop and give to the state an asset management plan that includes a schedule for identifying and replacing infrastructure like old pipes and meters as well as the estimated cost of such projects and the projected rate increases needed to afford them.

Municipal leaders and environmental groups are lining up against the bill arguing it’s a solution in search of a problem. They said it would create ratepayer-funded market research for private businesses searching for their next deal under the guise of consumer protection.

“Legislators in Harrisburg come up with many many different types of proposed regulations on our industry” said Anthony Bellitto Jr. executive director of the North Penn Water Authority which serves about 70000 people in Montgomery County. “And unfortunately most of those legislators have no idea what they’re talking about.”

The bill passed the state Senate 27-23 in June and is now awaiting further action in the state House.

The lower chamber’s Environmental Resources and Energy Committee held a hearing on the bill known as the Water Quality Accountability Act this week and executives from two private water companies — Bryn Mawr-based Essential Utilities the parent company of Aqua America and New Jersey-based American Water Works Company — gave supportive testimony.

Combined the two companies already serve at least 1.1 million households and businesses across the state and are eyeing expansion — for instance Aqua America is in talks to buy the Bucks County sewer system for more than $1 billion.

At the hearing Aqua America President Marc Lucca argued that asset management plans as required by the bill encourage water providers to be proactive about inspecting repairing and replacing infrastructure like fire hydrants and lead pipes.

“People drink our water. They drink our product” Lucca said. “And if a provider cannot meet the most basic requirements would you feel safe consuming their water or giving it to your family your children or grandchildren?”

Public water authorities already have to comply with the federal Safe Drinking Water Act among dozens of other state and federal laws and release yearly reports on water quality levels. The North Penn Water Authority’s 2022 report for instance was clear of any violations.

In addition to requiring asset management plans the legislation would also require water authorities to develop a cybersecurity plan and an inspection plan for valves that connect to hospitals or prevent wastewater backflows among others.

The state Department of Environmental Protection would be in charge of reviewing and enforcing the plans and would establish the timeline for authorities to comply with the plan.

These layers of oversight authorities argued could result in systems misallocating dollars. For instance the bill singles out water meter replacement as a priority. While that sounds good on paper Bellitto said that a broken meter isn’t a top concern as it won’t impact a customer’s service or artificially inflate their bill.

“Let us determine what is the best way to use our limited resources” Bellitto said. “It’s probably much better for us to replace a water main that’s had three breaks in it over the past winter than putting that money into replacing meters.”

New Jersey passed its own version of the law in 2017. Since then local water services have had to deploy staffing and dollars in places where they aren’t needed leaving untouched some tasks that are more urgent said Peggy Gallos executive director of the state’s Association of Environmental Authorities a trade group.

Pennsylvania’s new budget allocated $320 million in federal stimulus money to water and sewer systems and the systems also have access to billions more in aid approved in the 2021 federal infrastructure bill. That puts them in a stronger financial position.

But this sudden windfall comes after decades of underinvestment in water. The additional requirements of the proposal Bellitto said will continue to force authorities to choose between their own plans or those mandated by state law.

Gov. Tom Wolf a Democrat opposes the legislation in its current form his spokesperson said in an email as it would “impose significant new obligations on municipally owned water systems without a clear demonstration that the cost of those obligations are justified by the expected benefits to public health and safety.”

ELIZABETH ROBERTSON / Philadelphia Inquirer It’s probably much better for us to replace a water main that’s had three breaks in it over the past winter than putting that money into replacing meters"" said Anthony Bellitto Jr. executive director of the North Penn Water Authority which serves about 70000 people in Montgomery County.

A path to privatization — and higher bills?

In public remarks water executives have acknowledged a motive beyond safety for the legislation — helping to pave the way for more acquisitions.

In a February 2021 call with investors American Water Works executive Walter Lynch was asked about “emerging legislation that would also help facilitate” mergers and acquisitions. Lynch immediately named the Water Quality Accountability Act as an example.

Forcing water authorities to take stock of their systems could be a “wake-up call for many municipalities to say ‘maybe we should talk to American Water about selling the system’” Lynch said.

Lucca addressed concerns about privatization during this week’s state House hearing saying it “may be a result” of the bill.

The utility industry is already a powerful political force in the General Assembly. Companies spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on lobbying and political donations every year and a number of former legislators and staffers either work directly for or are under contract with the industry.

Among the most notable is former state House Speaker Mike Turzai (R. Allegheny) who is counsel for Peoples Gas a subsidiary of Essential Utilities. As speaker Turzai threw his support behind an ultimately unsuccessful effort by Peoples to “partner” with the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority.

Allegheny Strategy Partners a lobbying firm in which former state Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati (R. Jefferson) is a partner lobbies for Aqua America according to Department of State records.

This influence experts say can be seen in two laws the legislature passed in the past decade. One enacted in 2012 allows private utility companies to place surcharges on water bills outside of regular rate increases to pay for infrastructure projects.

Another law enacted in 2016 allows for the sale of water infrastructure at market price rather than at book value. This allows companies to inflate their purchasing price of water systems wowing local officials with a big one-time windfall said Cornell University professor Mildred Warner.

The proposed water quality bill Warner said amounts to intimidating local governments with new requirements before private companies swoop in and offer a big check.

At first local officials may not see much to dislike in an offer of millions of dollars to get rid of some troublesome assets.

But water services are typically a monopoly Warner added so it’s hard to find an accurate sale price. And the costs of maintaining the water system whether it’s patching a leaky water main or replacing lead pipes don’t disappear after a sale.

Instead rate increases to fix these issues will be decided by a private company seeking profit instead of by a public board accountable to ratepayers.

“What’s not to like?” Warner said “Well what’s not to like is if you’re the resident in the community you just lost control over your water.”

In March Warner released a study with Food and Water Watch — an environmental group that opposes water privatization — examining the 500 largest water systems in the U.S.

The study found that customers of privately owned systems paid $144 more every year on average for water than customers of publicly owned systems and that in communities with privately owned water systems low-income households spent 1.55% more of their income on their water bills.

The pro-industry policies already passed in Pennsylvania and New Jersey the study added cost ratepayers an additional $89 each year on average.

It’s unclear whether the bill will advance in the state House as influential environmental groups have come out strongly against it.

“We are taking a much closer look across the board at bills that deal with privatization and corporate regulations because they create loopholes for companies to ignore environmental quality” said Katie Blume political and legislative director for the Conservation Voters of PA an environmental advocacy group.

At least one conservative lawmaker is also skeptical. Speaking during the public hearing this week state Rep. Daryl Metcalfe (R. Butler) who chairs the environmental committee said that given the testimony the committee heard he expected “additional work” on the bill.

“I’m normally against government regulating more than they already are and I am for rolling back regulations and not imposing new ones” Metcalfe said. “So what are we fixing?”

The decision follows months of public dispute between the water sector and the EPA over how to adequately monitor the water supply for cyberthreats an increasing concern following cyberattacks on water facilities in California and Florida.

Anne Neuberger deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology revealed the administration’s plans during an interview last week saying she believes the EPA is well-equipped to ensure the cybersecurity of the sector is “holistically considered.”

Enforcing cybersecurity regulations across the vast water sector is no small undertaking. Industry officials say there are 51000 drinking water systems nationwide and an estimated 85 percent of water companies are municipal and sometimes very small.

By not tailoring the approach to better assess and confront different utilities’ cybersecurity needs and by relying on workers untrained in cybersecurity to carry out audits industry groups say the EPA could be setting up a system that misses cyberattacks.

Industrial cybersecurity experts also scoffed at the notion that state sanitation inspectors can effectively monitor and regulate cyber controls.

“Many of the water clients we work with have contracting firms that do basic IT services for them split across multiple companies because it’s the only way they can afford it” said Rob Lee CEO of Dragos an industrial cybersecurity firm. “There is not the skill sets to go audit these [utilities] and there’s not a large set of cybersecurity skill sets in general let alone in every single state [sanitation department]. I think it’d be impossible to pull this off.”

A spokesperson for Neuberger at the White House National Security Council (NSC) told CyberScoop that there are currently no minimum cybersecurity mandates for the water sector and the Biden White House is working across the administration industry and Congress to ensure every critical sector has minimum cybersecurity standards in place.

“These mandates are foundational to getting the sector the resources necessary to improve their cybersecurity – specifically to the 1600 water companies that are critical due to the population size they serve” the NSC spokesperson said via email. “There is no one-size-fits all approach to securing critical U.S. infrastructure since every sector is so different.”

The NSC spokesperson said the administration is working closely with the EPA to better secure the water sector and that change will take time. An EPA spokesperson said the agency has “engaged with our valued water sector partners on this important topic.”

Utilities “don’t have the resources to do cybersecurity today so just telling them that now they must and they must do it through regulation still doesn’t change the economic situation.” rob lee ceo of dragos

But the country’s largest water industry group the American Water Works Association (AWWA) said the EPA has ignored its outreach and forged ahead with the rule change without engaging. Kevin Morley the head of federal relations for AWWA said sanitation reviews are largely visual inspections to ensure water utility’s physical equipment — tanks pipes and the like — is working effectively.

“We see significant challenges on the implementation side for the state to even evaluate some of the most basic cybersecurity controls that we would think would be appropriate” Morley said. “How do you assess other than just [the sanitation inspector] saying ‘Yeah I did that.’”

Neuberger said last week that she is confident EPA staff “have the basis of knowledge” to ensure cybersecurity standards are effectively regulated.

But Rep. Jim Langevin D-R.I. an influential member of the House Homeland Security Committee and the Cyberspace Solarium Commission said in June that the EPA “faces challenges in meeting its responsibilities” against cyberattacks.

CyberScoop reported in June that the EPA’s cybersecurity arm within the Office of Water has at most $7 million in its annual budget for cybersecurity far short of the $45 million the CSC recommended in its final report in March 2020. The EPA has declined to comment on that contention.

The CSC’s report decried the lack of coordination between the public and private sectors in monitoring and regulating water utilities’ cybersecurity practices and sounded alarms about water sector preparedness for cyberattack.

There is precedent for hackers infiltrating water utilities. In February 2020 a hacker infiltrated remote access software shared by employees at a Florida water plant raising lye to more than 100 times normal levels.

Langevin has backed up the water sector’s claims about the EPA’s staffing and budget shortfalls saying in June that until the EPA is “appropriately resourced and empowered to fulfill its critical mission” as the risk management agency for water it will be difficult to bolster the sector’s security.

Lee from Dragos said it’s a thorny dilemma particularly with so many utilities facing vastly disparate challenges based on their size and funding. The underlying problem is how to pay for the cybersecurity the water sector should have he said — a problem that Lee said is compounded by the fact that water utilities cannot easily raise fees due to their monopoly status.

Utilities “don’t have the resources to do cybersecurity today so just telling them that now they must and they must do it through regulation still doesn’t change the economic situation” Lee said. “There’s a whole people process technology and regulatory shift that needs to happen … They’re gonna have to spend a long time — we’re talking years — to resource and build up staff.”

Got water?

Cuyamaca College’s Center for Water Studies will co-host the first annual Military Career Day on Aug. 10 geared toward military personnel and veterans interested in careers in water and wastewater operations.

The free event co-hosted by regional water agencies and the American Water Works Association will take place from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Cuyamaca College’s Student Center located at 900 Rancho San Diego Parkway in El Cajon.

Anyone can attend and participants are asked to register at CenterForWaterStudies.org. Lunch will be provided.

Attendees can:

· Learn how skills and experience gained during military service can match up with career opportunities in the water and wastewater industries.

· Meet with recruiters from water agencies in the region.

· Gather information about industry pay and benefits.

· Get advice on career pathways.

· Learn about fast-track educational opportunities offered by the Center for Water Studies which provides specialized training in water and wastewater operations.

Among those expected to attend are representatives from regional water agencies and Mark Balmert CEO of the San Diego Military Advisory Council and a retired Real Admiral in the Navy. Balmer’s organization fosters connections between the military elected and appointed officials and the region’s business community.

Cuyamaca’s Center for Water Studies the oldest and most comprehensive water/wastewater technology program in the California Community Colleges system actively recruits veterans through its Warriors2WaterWorks campaign for training in numerous certificate programs.

“We work very very closely with the water and wastewater industries to anticipate what their needs are and to make sure that we add people in the pipeline who have the skills and the certifications they need to be effective” said Don Jones a retired water industry professional and former college instructor and administrator at the Center for Water Studies who conduct outreach. “We are always right at the cutting edge and work in partnership with the water agencies to make sure that the programs that we offer build the knowledge skills and abilities that they need in their workforce.”

Careers in the water and wastewater industries are a great match for veterans because they are mission-driven technical and focused on providing critical public services said Jose Martinez General Manager of the Otay Water District in Spring Valley and a former Navy officer. “Just like the military we have structure we all have a bunch of different disciplines and we all work together.”

The industries are also hungry for well-trained individuals. Today they face a “silver tsunami” of impending retirements and need new talent. A recent survey found an 8-9% turn-over rate among the 4500 full-time positions in the water management industry in San Diego County due to retirements. That translates into about 380 open jobs per year.

The state Legislature has recognized the special skills that veterans can offer and in 2019 passed Assembly Bill 1588 which provides a path for veterans transitioning to civilian employment to receive credit for their military experience and education toward certifications in the water industry.

Veterans can turbo-charge their careers by obtaining specific training and expertise at Cuyamaca’s Center for Water Studies.

The Center offers a comprehensive curriculum that beginning this fall will include seven specializations. Completing courses in a specialization prepares students to take a state-required certification exam for that specialization. The newest specialization is advanced water treatment. The new curriculum will be closely aligned with the skills and expertise needed in programs such as “Pure Water San Diego” – a phased multi-year program that aims to provide 40% of San Diego’s water supply locally by the end of 2035.

Other specializations offered are Water Treatment Plant Operations Backflow & Cross-Connection Control Water Resources Management Water Distribution Operations Wastewater Treatment Operations and Wastewater Collection Systems.

The Center for Water Studies traces its roots in our region to 1960 and moved to Cuyamaca College in 2003. The center is housed on campus in a building with two classrooms a laboratory and a shop.

The Center for Water Studies focuses on preparing people for mid-skill career pathways – in other words careers that require more than a high school diploma but less than an associate’s or bachelor’s degree. These kinds of jobs represent about 60% of the region’s 4500 jobs in the industry. Entry-level jobs pay about $50000 to $55000 annually and positions in the industry often come with a generous package of benefits including medical dental and vision insurance as well as a retirement benefit from the California Public Employees’ Retirement System.

Anne Solano Human Resources Manager for the Helix Water District in La Mesa said her district relies on the professional training that the Center for Water Studies offers. Graduates who she has hired “definitely have an understanding of water and the actual distribution system and how it’s all put together” Solano said. Helix encourages employees to continue their education by taking classes at Cuyamaca and pursuing higher certification levels.

Martinez from Otay Water District said careers in the water and wastewater industries allow veterans to continue serving their country “on a more localized community level. … here you’re serving your community.”

Many people may take their water and wastewater system for granted – until it’s not working. Providing clean drinking water and safely processing wastewater “very rarely gets the attention so you have a group of people who are doing it not for glory (but) … because they’re committed to the mission” Martinez said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9zdGxvdWlzL25ld3MvMjAyMi8wOC8wNC9tb3N0LWluZmx1ZW50aWFsLWJ1c2luZXNzLXdvbWVuLTIwMjItcmViZWNjYS1sb3NsaS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Most Influential Business Women 2022: Rebecca Losli oversees $400M in capital projects for Missouri American Water ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/news/2022/08/04/most-influential-business-women-2022-rebecca-losli.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9zdGxvdWlzL25ld3MvMjAyMi8wOC8wNC9tb3N0LWluZmx1ZW50aWFsLWJ1c2luZXNzLXdvbWVuLTIwMjItcmViZWNjYS1sb3NsaS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

""Last year after 25 years of proud history we at CCXI delivered on our founding promise with the approval of TAVNEOS for patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-associated vasculitis (ANCA-associated vasculitis). It is an honor to now join Amgen's great mission and together begin a bright new era bringing landscape-shaping medicines like TAVNEOS to those who will benefit most.""

TAVNEOS is an orally administered selective complement component 5a receptor inhibitor. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in October 2021 as an adjunctive treatment for adult patients with severe active ANCA-associated vasculitis specifically granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) (the two main forms of ANCA-associated vasculitis) in combination with standard therapy.

ANCA-associated vasculitis is an umbrella term for a group of multi-system autoimmune diseases with small vessel inflammation. Inflamed vessels may rupture or become occluded giving rise to a broad array of clinical symptoms and signs related to a systemic inflammatory response which may result in profound injury and dysfunction in the kidneys lungs and other organs.

Amgen is a leader in inflammation and nephrology. The company's inflammation portfolio includes Otezla® ENBREL® TEZSPIRE® AMGEVITA™ (a biosimilar to HUMIRA®) RIABNI™ (a biosimilar to Rituxan®) and AVSOLA® (a biosimilar to REMICADE®).

About ChemoCentryx

ChemoCentryx is a biopharmaceutical company commercializing and developing new medications for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and cancer. ChemoCentryx targets the chemokine and chemoattractant systems to discover develop and commercialize orally administered therapies. In the United States ChemoCentryx markets TAVNEOS® (avacopan) the first approved orally administered inhibitor of the complement 5a receptor as an adjunctive treatment for adult patients with severe active ANCA-associated vasculitis. TAVNEOS is also in late-stage clinical development for the treatment of severe hidradenitis suppurativa and C3 glomerulopathy (C3G). Additionally ChemoCentryx has early-stage drug candidates that target chemoattractant receptors in other inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and in cancer.

About TAVNEOS® (avacopan)

TAVNEOS (avacopan) approved by the FDA as an adjunctive treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis is a first-in-class orally administered small molecule that employs a novel highly targeted mode of action in complement-driven autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. While the precise mechanism in ANCA vasculitis has not been definitively established TAVNEOS by blocking the complement 5a receptor (C5aR) for the pro-inflammatory complement system fragment known as C5a on destructive inflammatory cells such as blood neutrophils is presumed to arrest the ability of those cells to do damage in response to C5a activation which is known to be the driver of ANCA vasculitis. TAVNEOS's selective inhibition of only the C5aR leaves the beneficial C5a pathway through the C5L2 receptor functioning normally.

ChemoCentryx is also developing TAVNEOS for the treatment of patients with C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and lupus nephritis (LN). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted TAVNEOS orphan drug designation for ANCA-associated vasculitis and C3G. The European Commission has granted orphan medicinal product designation for TAVNEOS for the treatment of two forms of ANCA-associated vasculitis: microscopic polyangiitis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis) as well as for C3G.

About ANCA-Associated Vasculitis

ANCA-associated vasculitis is an umbrella term for a group of multi-system autoimmune diseases with small vessel inflammation. Inflamed vessels may rupture or become occluded giving rise to a broad array of clinical symptoms and signs related to a systemic inflammatory response which may result in profound injury and dysfunction in the kidneys lungs and other organs. Prior to the approval of TAVNEOS treatment for ANCA-associated vasculitis was limited to courses of non-specific immuno-suppressants (cyclophosphamide or rituximab) combined with the administration of daily glucocorticoids (steroids) for prolonged periods of time which can be associated with significant clinical risk including death from infection.

U.S. PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

TAVNEOS (avacopan) is indicated as an adjunctive treatment of adult patients with severe active anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (granulomatosis with polyangiitis [GPA] and microscopic polyangiitis [MPA]) in combination with standard therapy including glucocorticoids. TAVNEOS does not eliminate glucocorticoid use.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

Contraindications

The latest purchase? A $3.7 billion deal to acquire ChemoCentryx.

The proposed takeover gives Amgen Tavneos which last fall became ChemoCentryx’s first commercial product in its 25-year history. The drug is approved by the FDA to treat a rare autoimmune disease called anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated (ANCA) vasculitis in which damage to small blood vessels can cause organ failures especially in the kidney.

The acquisition “represents a compelling opportunity for Amgen to add to our decades-long leadership in inflammation and nephrology with Tavneos” Amgen CEO Robert Bradway said in a statement Thursday.

Inflammatory disease marks a key focus area at Amgen. Before the all-cash transaction Amgen already had psoriasis drug Otezla from a $13.4 billion deal with Celgene back in 2019. And Amgen's TNF blocker Enbrel remains its top-selling product.

Plus in collaboration with AstraZeneca the company recently won an early FDA approval for blockbuster-to-be asthma treatment Tezspire.

But the Amgen star inflammatory portfolio could come under pressure. For Otezla Bristol Myers Squibb’s deucravacitinib which has an FDA target decision date in September for plaque psoriasis could be a serious threat. And Enbrel is slated to lose U.S. patent protection in the latter half of the decade.

More broadly Amgen’s bone meds Prolia and Xgeva are nearing a 2025 patent cliff. PCKS9 cholesterol drug Repatha and CGRP migraine therapy Aimovig both face tough competition in their respective markets. And even Amgen's first-in-class cancer drug Lumakras might soon have to battle Mirati Therapeutics’ rival KRAS inhibitor adagrasib.

That’s why Wall Street analysts have been calling on Amgen to make more deals—and it has. Last year the California drugmaker made a string of acquisitions picking up oncology player Five Prime Therapeutics for $1.9 billion antibody drug specialist Teneobio for $900 million upfront and tissue regeneration expert Rodeo Therapeutics for $55 million upfront.

But those deals weren’t enough for Amgen’s commercial business.

“At this point we do not have conviction that the existing pipeline will offset [loss of exclusivity] declines and we believe Amgen needs to continue to pursue M&A to enhance its internal portfolio” SVB Securities analysts wrote in a May note.

ChemoCentryx’s addition with Tavneos’ unadjusted global sales potential at over $2 billion by 2030 marks “a meaningful step” toward filling the upcoming revenue gap the SVB team wrote in a Thursday note.

ChemoCentryx plans to start a phase 3 test of Tavneos in hidradenitis suppurativa and a new study in lupus nephritis later this year the SVB team noted. The company also has three early-stage drug candidates that target ulcerative colitis and skin conditions and an oral immune checkpoint inhibitor for cancer.

The ChemoCentryx deal also adds fuel to the anti-inflammation field targeting the complement system. Tavneos is an oral complement component 5a (C5a) receptor inhibitor. Before that Amgen was already in late-stage development of a biosimilar referencing AstraZeneca’s C5 inhibitor Soliris.

AstraZeneca stimulated the complement field with its $39 billion purchase of Soliris developer Alexion a year ago. In May Vertex Pharmaceuticals scooped up a portfolio of early-stage complement therapies from foundering Catalyst Biosciences for $60 million.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL2FtZ2VuLWJ1eS1jaGVtb2NlbnRyeXgtMzctYmlsbGlvbi0yMDIyLTA4LTA0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amgen bets on ChemoCentryx's rare disease drug in $3.7 billion deal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/amgen-buy-chemocentryx-37-billion-2022-08-04/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL2FtZ2VuLWJ1eS1jaGVtb2NlbnRyeXgtMzctYmlsbGlvbi0yMDIyLTA4LTA0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZWJpb3RlY2guY29tL2Jpb3RlY2gvYW1nZW4tdGFrZXMtYml0ZXMtb3V0LXBpcGVsaW5lLWRyb3BwaW5nLWJjbWEtYW5kLXBzbWEtYXNzZXRzLWxpZ2h0LWRhdGEtYW5kLWNvbXBldGl0aW9u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amgen takes BiTEs out of pipeline dropping BCMA PSMA assets in light of data and competition,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZWJpb3RlY2guY29tL2Jpb3RlY2gvYW1nZW4tdGFrZXMtYml0ZXMtb3V0LXBpcGVsaW5lLWRyb3BwaW5nLWJjbWEtYW5kLXBzbWEtYXNzZXRzLWxpZ2h0LWRhdGEtYW5kLWNvbXBldGl0aW9u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D8467BEB0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZWJpb3RlY2guY29tL2Jpb3RlY2gvYW1nZW4tdGFrZXMtYml0ZXMtb3V0LXBpcGVsaW5lLWRyb3BwaW5nLWJjbWEtYW5kLXBzbWEtYXNzZXRzLWxpZ2h0LWRhdGEtYW5kLWNvbXBldGl0aW9u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vbWVkY2l0eW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvYW1nZW5zLTMtN2ItY2hlbW9jZW50cnl4LWFjcXVpc2l0aW9uLWFkZHMtYS1uZXctcGllY2UtdG8tYXV0b2ltbXVuZS1zdHJhdGVneS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amgen’s $3.7B ChemoCentryx acquisition adds a new piece to autoimmune strategy,"Amgen is shelling out nearly $4 billion to acquire ChemoCentryx the latest in a string of M&A moves for the pharmaceutical giant and one that helps the company expand its approach to treating autoimmune diseases and potentially also cancer.

ChemoCentryx’s main asset is Tavneos a treatment for ANCA-associated vasculitis an autoimmune disease that damages organs particularly the kidneys. FDA approval of Tavneos last fall made the twice-daily pill the first treatment specifically developed for this rare and potentially fatal condition.

Amgen’s immunology portfolio is led by Enbrel a blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug. Like many of the top-selling immunology drugs currently available Enbrel is a large molecule biologic given as an injection. With ChemoCentryx Thousand Oaks California-based Amgen is betting on an immunology drug that’s more along the lines of its plaque psoriasis medicine Otezla a small molecule that comes in a more patient-friendly pill form. ChemoCentryx brings Amgen a company entirely focused on developing small molecule drugs that are alternatives to injected or infused biologics.

Speaking on a Thursday conference call Amgen CEO Bob Bradway focused his ChemoCentryx comments on the commercialization opportunity for Tavneos. ANCA-associated vasculitis patients need this drug because the older medicines that have been used to treat the disease mainly immunosuppressants and steroids have harsh side effects he said. As part of Amgen the drug can leverage the pharma giant’s connections with prescribing physicians.

“Decades of leadership in immunology and nephrology will allow us to add value to the Tavneos launch reaching many more patients and much more quickly than would otherwise have been possible” Bradway said.

Sponsored Post A Personalized Approach to Medication Nonadherence At the Abarca Forward conference earlier this year George Van Antwerp managing director at Deloitte discussed how social determinants of health and a personalized member experience can improve medication adherence and health outcomes.

In ANCA-associated vasculitis white blood cells called neutrophils attack blood vessels and spark inflammation. The disease develops when a part of the immune system called the complement system is dysregulated. Tavneos is a small molecule designed to block a pro-inflammatory component of the complement system that’s found on neutrophils. In its 2021 annual report ChemoCentryx said that its drug appears to offer a more targeted approach than Soliris and Ultomiris both of them blockbuster antibody drugs from AstraZeneca that address the complement system to treat other disorders. That targeted effect could reduce the risk of infections though ChemoCentryx also notes that serious infections have been reported in patients treated with its drug.

If Amgen plans to use the ChemoCentryx drug to challenge the AstraZeneca products executives aren’t saying so outright. But Tavneos offers a “pipeline in a product” opportunity. In addition to its approved use in ANCA-associated vasculitis Mountain View California-based ChemoCentryx has reached mid-stage testing of the drug in hidradentis suppurativa a chronic inflammatory skin condition whose current treatments include biologic medicines. Preliminary data from a Phase 2 test showed the drug did not meet the main goal in the overall study population though the company said it has positive results in a subgroup of patients. Starting a Phase 3 study in patients with severe hidradentis suppurativa depends on feedback from the FDA ChemoCentryx said in its financial reports. The company also has Phase 2 data for Tavneos in complement 3 glomerulopathy a rare kidney disorder with no FDA-approved therapies.

Lupus nephritis an autoimmune kidney disorder whose current treatment options include biologic medicines is another disease target for Tavneos. ChemoCentryx had said it expects to begin clinical testing in this indication in the second half of this year. CCX507 an orally dosed drug candidate for inflammatory bowel disease is being readied for Phase 2 testing.

ChemoCentryx hopes its small molecule approach to traditionally biologic targets can also apply to cancer. Some of the top-selling cancer immunotherapies belong to a class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors. These antibody drugs block proteins that cancers use to evade the immune system. ChemoCentryx’s CCX559 is an orally administered small molecule that targets checkpoint proteins. This drug could provide an alternative to currently available checkpoint inhibitors large molecule drugs that are dosed as infusions. CCX559 is in Phase 1 testing.

David Reese Amgen’s executive vice president research and development acknowledged the clinical research that ChemoCentryx has done with Tavneos in additional indications. He said Amgen and ChemoCentryx will look at the data to develop the best path forward for addressing diseases that have few effective therapies. Amgen executives did not discuss the other drug candidates in the ChemoCentryx pipeline.

Amgen has been an active acquirer as of late. Otezla was purchased from Bristol Myers Squibb in 2019 for $13.4 billion a deal made to satisfy Federal Trade Commission requirements for BMS’s purchase of Celgene. Last year Amgen reached a $1.9 billion deal to acquire cancer drug biotech Five Prime Therapeutics. Months later Amgen agreed to pay $400 million up front for global rights excluding Japan for a Kyowa Kirwin antibody in development for atopic dermatitis. In June Amgen struck a $900 million deal to acquire antibody drug developer Teneobio.

For ChemoCentryx Amgen is paying $52 cash for each share of the biotech a more than 115% premium to the stock’s Wednesday closing price. The deal values ChemoCentryx at $3.7 billion.

The boards of directors of both companies have approved the transaction which the companies expect will close in the fourth quarter of this year. The merger agreement bars ChemoCentryx from soliciting other bids or even engaging in talks with other parties about another proposal. If ChemoCentryx breaches that provision or if an unsolicited superior offer emerges and the biotech terminates the Amgen deal it must pay a $119 million termination fee according to the merger agreement.

Axio CEO Scott Kannry tells TechCrunch that the proceeds — which bring New York–based Axio’s total capital raised to $30 million — will be put toward product and engineering team development and supporting go-to-market functions and expanding across “key geographies.”

Axio was co-founded in 2016 by Kannry and Dave White who say they were inspired by the difficulty companies often have making decisions around cybersecurity investments. Kannry led the cyber insurance team for several years at Aon while Dave came from Carnegie Mellon and spent the bulk of his career architecting cybersecurity frameworks including a model — C2M2 (Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model) — adopted by the U.S. Department of Energy.

“We saw how CEOs and boards of directors struggled with even approaching discussions around cyber risk. At that time the common view was that cyber was fundamentally a technical problem solved through investments in IT by the people who run IT” Kannry said in an email interview with TechCrunch. “Now given the wave of high-profile breaches affecting virtually every sector industry and size of organization boards and CEOs recognize that cybersecurity is fundamentally a business problem which literally requires the discussion of it in financial terms.”

Axio aims to help businesses answer questions like whether they should invest in cyber controls (e.g. endpoint security) versus cyber insurance and how much of a budget a security team needs to reduce the likelihood of a loss Kannry said. The product produces reports that quantify cyber risk in financial terms without resorting to scores and technical jargon allowing departments to input information to generate metrics showing how a company is — or isn’t — improving over time.

Startups like BitSight offer similar products that assess the likelihood an organization will be breached. But Kannry says that Axio differentiates through a focus on modeling the impact of cyber scenarios. In other words Axio worries less about probabilities when evaluating risk and more about their severest effects.

Axio recently introduced dynamic scenarios that let companies model “what if” scenarios to help them understand how to prioritize their security controls. It also inked strategic partnerships with several large cyber insurers which Kannry says leverage Axio’s platform as part of their cyber insurance underwriting processes.

“Our platform allows security leaders to baseline their existing security controls quantify their cyber exposure in dollars and stress-test their insurance coverage to understand if they are sufficiently covered. [It moves] beyond legacy and compliance-driven approaches to cybersecurity to more risk-based models that [look] at cybersecurity holistically and in the context of spending” Kannry said. “Over the past two years we’ve seen significant uptick in security leaders leveraging our platform to assess and quantify their cyber risk. Many of our core customers in energy and critical infrastructure despite spending in some cases millions of dollars per year in cybersecurity controls began to critically evaluate their cyber programs in the wake of high-profile attacks like SolarWinds and the ransomware-related shutdown of Colonial Pipeline. At the same time cyber insurers and reinsurers have asked us to provide deeper quantified risk visibility to support their underwriting teams.”

It’s certainly true that there’s pressure on businesses particularly public ones to better manage cyber risk. Earlier this year the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission proposed new reporting rules that pertain to cybersecurity postures and policies for all publicly traded companies. While they haven’t been formally adopted the suggested requirements include periodic updates about previously revealed cybersecurity incidents and disclosures of management’s role in mitigating risk and implementing cybersecurity procedures.

Meanwhile certain forms of cyberattack are becoming common. According to cybersecurity firm Sophos’s 2022 report 66% of organizations were hit with ransomware attacks last year up from just 37% in 2020.

Spurred by these pressures Gartner predicts that 40% of all public boards will have dedicated cybersecurity committees by 2025.

“Despite significant increases in cybersecurity spending in recent years cyber threats continue to pose significant challenges for companies across every sector especially for critical infrastructure operators who have historically been at the heart of our customer base” Kannry added. “The rise of state-sponsored cyberattacks geopolitical instability and ‘ransomware-as-a-service’ have all demonstrated the critical infrastructure sector’s susceptibility to attacks … The pandemic [also] changed the cyber risk landscape for our customers especially in the critical infrastructure sector. Companies were going remote enabling remote access for employees and systems and introducing a range of new technologies and collaboration tools that were introducing additional attack vectors.”

The cybersecurity industry once the VC darling has been hammered by layoffs recently as macroeconomic factors take their toll. But Kannry says Axio has had no trouble at all securing clients with a customer base that now totals over 350 companies including utilities oil and gas providers and energy grid trade associations.

While he declined to reveal financials Kannry said that he was “very happy” with the round size and deal terms which he expects will allow Axio to double the size of its 35-person team by the end of the year. “We have an aggressive product roadmap into 2023” he said. “[We’ll] be using funds partly to accelerate investments in our AI machine learning and data science teams to add deeper automation capabilities.”"

HOUSTON — APA Corp. has issued a brief update on its offshore E&P operations in its latest results statement.

The company and partner/operator TotalEnergies plan further appraisal of the Krabdagu Field offshore Suriname after completing two flow tests on the discovery well.

APA and its partners are drilling further on exploration wells on Block 58 (Dikkop) and Block 53 (Baja) with results expected in the coming months.

Finally the company expects to shortly bring onstream the Garten-3 well a tieback to the Beryl complex in the UK central North Sea.

Operations were carried out using the Maersk Valiant in 780m water depth following completion work at Bonboni-1. Drilling and logging work is ongoing and a DST will be performed. The well drilled to approximately 6500m TD a typical if challenging depth for most of the wells in this Upper Cretaceous Suriname play. The Krabdagu prospect has a similar seismic signature to the Sapakara and Keskesi wells. Krabdagu is the sixth exploration well on the block following discoveries at Maka Central Sapakara West Kwaskwasi and Keskesi East. The Bonboni-1 well encountered 16m net oil pay but is considered non-commercial and Keskesi South located nearby missed the target. Appraisal is ongoing and a development is expected here soon.

Senior Fellow

August 5 2022

Note: This analysis does not incorporate the recent change that Senate Democrats have made to the minimum corporate tax provision to prevent it from limiting depreciation breaks. It is reported that this will have a small effect on the overall impact of the provision.

Apple one of the largest corporations in the United States despite manufacturing most of its physical products offshore would likely pay the corporate minimum tax that is included in the Inflation Reduction Act that the Senate is debating this week. 3M a manufacturer that has about 40 percent of its workforce in the United States likely would not pay the corporate minimum tax if current trends in the company’s profits and taxes continue because it is already paying above 15 percent of its profits in taxes.

These figures are based on the profits and tax payments that both companies report in the 10-K that they submit to the Securities and Exchange Commission and make public. And they illustrate how two corporations characterized as manufacturers could be affected by the proposal.

The federal corporate income tax applies at a rate of 21 percent but many companies effectively pay far less than that because of the special breaks and loopholes that litter the tax code and many pay no income tax in some years. The IRA’s corporate minimum tax is meant to address this problem.

It would apply to companies with more than $1 billion in average global profits over three years. If such a company pays less than 15 percent of its global profits in income taxes (including both U.S. federal income taxes under the regular tax rules and foreign income taxes paid on offshore profits) then it would pay the difference under the proposed provision to bring its global effective tax rate up to 15 percent.

As illustrated in Table 1 below Apple has reported global effective tax rates of less than 15 percent in two of the previous four years.[1] 3M on the other hand has reported global effective tax rates of 19 to 21 percent during these years. If the corporate minimum tax had been in effect during this period it therefore seems likely that it would have affected Apple but not 3M.[2]

It is impossible to know this with certainty because the 10-K does not include all the information one would need to calculate the precise effects of the provision. And the companies’ tax positions could change over time meaning it is difficult to use this information to predict which corporations would or would not be affected by the provision in the future.

Republicans Cite the Provision’s Likely Effect on Manufacturing but “Manufacturing” Can Mean Different Things

Last week Sen. Mike Crapo the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee released a statement arguing that the provision would “overwhelmingly hit American manufacturers and supply chains.”

As ITEP has explained elsewhere Sen. Crapo’s statement relies on an incomplete analysis from Congress’s official revenue estimators at the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT). It shows that of the $313 billion that would be raised over a decade by the corporate minimum tax about half that amount ($156 billion) would be paid by corporations that describe themselves as mainly manufacturers. Crapo does not mention that the bill would spend $369 billion on energy and climate provisions that would increase manufacturing of electric cars batteries solar panels and other products in the United States.

The principle of the minimum tax – that all successful corporations should pay a reasonable amount of taxes to help finance the public investments that make their success possible – would logically seem to apply to all companies regardless of sector.

Further the JCT report cited by Crapo relies on a broad definition of “manufacturing” that corporations designate for themselves and which includes companies like Apple that do not physically produce much of anything here in the United States. Apple’s physical products are made by suppliers it contracts with including 338 suppliers in Asia (156 in China alone) and only 25 suppliers that are located primarily in the United States.

In fact companies like Apple are precisely why the corporate minimum tax is needed. A 2013 Senate hearing exposed the convoluted accounting gimmicks the company used to claim profits were generated by subsidiaries in Ireland that were for tax purposes not resident of any country and thus not taxed. When under international pressure the Irish government began to crack down Apple shifted its strategy to another tax haven the tiny island of Jersey. This was revealed in the “Paradise Papers” a trove of documents from the Bermuda-based law firm that helped Apple pull off this feat.

3M could not be more different from Apple. Most Americans probably know 3M as a manufacturer of tape sandpaper and medical supplies including masks worn to avoid Covid. 3M is a huge conglomerate but with profits ranging from $5 billion to $7 billion in recent years it seems small compared to Apple with its recent global profits exceeding $100 billion. As of 2020 3M reported that it had 96000 employees and that 39000 of those around 40 percent of the total were in the United States.

There has been little if any attention paid by the media to 3M’s tax strategies. This is not to say that the company eschews tax avoidance for any altruistic or ethical reason. But the simple fact is that its global effective tax rate each year has been a bit higher than Apple’s and high enough to avoid paying under the IRA’s corporate minimum tax.

Table 2 below provides a more detailed version of the information in Table 1 above about the two companies’ profits and taxes.

[1] The federal income tax shown here for the companies does not include a transition tax they both paid in 2018 ($37.3 billion in the case of Apple $97 million in the case of 3M) under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on offshore profits that they had reported in earlier years.

[2] The federal tax shown here is the “current” tax that the companies report for the tax year which is their best estimate of what they will ultimately pay for the tax year. This is the most useful number reported in the 10-K to understand what companies pay for specific tax years. It does not include deferred taxes which are taxes that companies expect and plan to pay in the future. The U.S. profits are taken from the 10-K and state income taxes are subtracted.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYXBwbGUtcHJvbWlzZXMtY2hhbmdlcy1mZW1hbGUtd29ya2Vycy1yZXBvcnRlZC1zZXh1YWwtaGFyYXNzbWVudC1oci0yMDIyLTjSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2FwcGxlLXByb21pc2VzLWNoYW5nZXMtZmVtYWxlLXdvcmtlcnMtcmVwb3J0ZWQtc2V4dWFsLWhhcmFzc21lbnQtaHItMjAyMi04P2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple to 'make changes' after 15 women report apathetic HR,"Tim Cook in November 2021. Mario Tama/Getty Images

Fifteen current and former Apple female employees say the company dismissed claims of misconduct.

The FT reports the HR unit retaliated against some of them after speaking up about the incidents.

Apple acknowledged its missteps telling the outlet that it intends to ""make changes.""

Apple said it's making changes after over a dozen women reported sexual misconduct and other forms of harassment — and were met with an apathetic sometimes hostile Human Resources team Financial Times reports.

In interviews with FT one woman said a male colleague took advantage of her after a casual co-worker's happy hour assisting her home and then removing her clothing to take photos of her when she fell asleep.

Another woman said a male colleague sent them incessant sexual messages and her manager bullied her when she took leave to be with an ailing relative.

The 15 women who are both current and former employees at Apple said they took their claims to the company's HR unit which is dubbed the People Team internally.

But the team primarily catered to the wishes of the managers instead of taking the women's claims seriously they alleged per the report. The FT viewed email exchanges showing HR turning defensive and claiming there was nothing they could do even if the women had hard proof.

Some women said reporting to officials eventually led to them leaving the company with the team citing indiscretions in their performance. Others said Apple offered them lump sums of salary ""for alleged emotional distress"" or as an incentive not to disparage the company.

Apple did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. A spokesperson told the FT that while the company wants all employees to feel comfortable reporting issues it hasn't always made it easy to do so.

""There are some accounts raised that do not reflect our intentions or our policies and we should have handled them differently including certain exchanges reported in this story"" Apple told the FT. ""As a result we will make changes to our training and processes.""

Apple is grappling with an increasingly vocal workforce

Apple has been attempting to publicly highlight its efforts to empower female employees in the workplace as has the rest of historically male-dominated Silicon Valley. Yet reports of continued inequality and maltreatment have surfaced at tech giants like Google and Amazon.

Apple is notorious for its intense culture of secrecy a feat challenged by the remote work-friendly pandemic the company's adoption of the workplace messaging platform Slack and fed-up employees taking to social media to air their grievances.

Workers have grown increasingly vocal about their concerns creating cracks in Apple's ""surprise and delight"" battle cry of keeping details about their work culture under wraps.

For example former Apple engineer Ashley Gjøvik posted claims of rampant sexism bullying and mismanagement on Twitter in August 2021 and was promptly put on leave. She alleged that senior employees kept a tally of votes on a whiteboard about how they could make her life at Apple a ""living hell.""







And in mid-2021 about 80 Apple employees wrote an internal letter to CEO Tim Cook protesting the company's return-to-office policy which would require them to work in the office three days a week.

It was postponed due to COVID-19 until May when another group of employees wrote an open letter to Apple's top brass pushing back on the mandate that would allow two days to work from home.

""You have characterized the decision for the Hybrid Working Pilot as being about combining the need to commune in-person and the value of flexible work"" the May letter reads. ""But in reality it does not recognize flexible work and is only driven by fear.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYWN3b3JsZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8yMzQ4NjAvYXBwbGUtc2lsaWNvbi1tMS1zeXN0ZW0tb24tY2hpcC1tYWNib29rLWFpci1tYWNib29rLXByby1tYWMtbWluaS1pbWFjLW0xeC1zcGVjcy1mZWF0dXJlcy1pbnRlbC1hcHBzLXJvc2V0dGEtMi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Everything you need to know about the M1 chip,"Macs have undergone a big change since June 2020. As announced at WWDC 2020 Apple has switched its internal architecture from one that uses Intel CPUs third-party graphics processors and other parts to the company’s own “system on a chip.” The first Apple silicon SoC for Macs is called the M1. That chip was followed up by the M1 Pro M1 Max and M1 Ultra.

It’s a big step for Apple and the Mac. But what does it mean for you? In this article we cover frequently asked questions about Apple’s system on a chip what it means to the user how it affects what software you can use and how fast it really is. We will regularly update this article with news reviews testing and releases so continue to check back.

Read about how Apple’s M1 and M2 processors compare to Intel in our Mac processor guide.

Update: There is now an M2 chip from Apple read about what to expect from the M2 – and the M2 Pro/Max and more (and when they will launch) plus how the M2 compared to the M1 Pro and M1 Max.

The M1 chip: Specs

What is the Apple silicon M1 system on a chip?

“Apple silicon” refers to the chips Apple makes. In the Mac they replace the Intel processors they have used for the past 14 years and will eventually also replace the AMD graphics processors in higher-end Macs. Apple silicon first made its appearance in the original iPad.

The M1 is Apple’s first Mac chip. Here are its specifications:

8-core CPU 4 performance cores 4 efficiency cores

7- or 8-core graphics processor (GPU)

16-core Neural Engine

8GB or 16GB of RAM

68.25GBps memory bandwidth

In the fall of 2021 Apple released the M1 Pro and M1 Max which are more powerful chips based on the M1 architecture. Here are the specifications:

M1 Pro

8- or 10-core CPU 6 or 8 performance cores 2 efficiency cores

14- or 16-core GPU

16-core Neural Engine

16GB or 32GB of RAM

200GBps memory bandwidth

M1 Max

10-core CPU 8 performance cores 2 efficiency cores

24- or 32-core GPU

16-core Neural Engine

32GB or 64GB of RAM

400GBps memory bandwidth

M1 Ultra

20-core CPU 16 performance cores 4 efficiency cores

48- or 64-core GPU

32-core Neural Engine

64GB or 128GB of RAM

800GBps memory bandwidth

Apple calls this a system on a chip (SoC) because it takes several components that are usually separate and puts them all on a single chip. This includes the CPU graphics processor USB and Thunderbolt controllers Secure Enclave Neural Engine image signal processor audio processing hardware and more. This results in better performance and battery life. Read all about Apple’s claims about the M1’s performance and battery efficiency.

What Macs use which M1 chips?

The M1 is in Apple’s more affordable Macs that are popular with general consumers. These Macs are:

Apple’s recently launched iPad Pro line (11-inch and 12.9-inch) use the M1 chip as well with the same RAM and a single Thunderbolt port.

The M1 Pro and M1 Max are in Macs targeted at professional users who are very demanding of the processor. These Macs are:

The M1 Ultra is currently Apple’s top-performing SoC. It’s only in one Mac model currently but it could make its way into the upcoming Mac Pro.

Apple announced a two-year transition meaning that within two years every Mac will have chips of Apple’s own design. So more Macs with Apple silicon are coming.

Can I get an M1 Mac with more than 16GB of RAM?

Not with these models. The amount of memory in the M1 Macs is a point of contention for some customers especially those who are used to the practice of having as much RAM as they can in order to do their work. The only way to get more RAM is to buy a Mac with an M1 Pro or M1 Max.

If you want an M1 Mac with more than 16GB of RAM your choices are the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro and the Mac Studio which have faster processors. The lowest-priced 14-inch MacBook Pro with an M1 Pro and 32GB of RAM is $2399 which is a hefty $900 more than the highest-priced standard configuration of the 13-inch MacBook Pro with an M1 and 16GB of RAM. The Mac Studio starts at $1999.

Apple silicon uses a “unified memory architecture” which is different from how memory is traditionally used in computers including Intel Macs. UMA is efficient and fast and it is possible that you may not need as much RAM as you think. Get the lowdown on Apple’s unified memory architecture and how memory is used in Apple silicon.

Are Macs with Intel processors still available?

Apple’s pricier Macs still use Intel processors: the $1099 Mac mini and the Mac Pro. The users of these Macs depend on software that’s not yet optimized for Apple silicon or they want more RAM than 64GB more powerful GPUs and other features not found on the M1 Macs.

Apple said its silicon rollout will occur in a two-year period so the M1 is just the start. Apple will eventually outfit all of its Macs with its own silicon and Intel processors will be completely phased out. Learn more about Apple’s transition from Intel to Apple silicon.

Will Apple will still support Intel Macs?

Apple said it will continue to provide support for its Intel Macs even after its Mac product line has fully switched to Apple silicon. Apple has sold millions of Intel Macs over the years and it knows that many of its customers use their Macs for a long time. Eventually Apple will stop supporting Intel Macs but that will not happen for several years.

You can probably expect new versions of macOS and their accompanying apps to be made available for Intel-based Macs until at least 2024 and official Apple technical support will extend far beyond that.

But I shouldn’t buy an Intel Mac right?

In our reviews of the M1-equipped 24-inch iMac MacBook Air 13-inch MacBook Pro Mac mini and Mac Studio we saw tremendous performance. They’re definitely quite a lot faster than their Intel counterparts. And with the laptops the battery life extends hours and hours beyond what was previously found in Intel-based models. If you’re considering a lower-priced Mac it’s hard to argue against the new M1-based models.

The Intel Macs are still good performers though. If the Mac you are considering has an Intel processor you do not need to rule it out. They are good computers.

However if you are not in a rush at all you’ll want to wait and see what Apple will offer in its other Macs. Apple’s consumer lineup with the M1 is set. The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro and M1 Max was the beginning of Apple’s pro lineup rollout followed by the Mac Studio. We should see a pro-level Mac mini this year. We could also see the Mac Pro but that probably won’t be revealed until WWDC in the summer. Learn more about Apple’s plans for Apple silicon Macs in 2021 and 2022.

The M1 chip: Apps

Will my software run on an Apple silicon Mac?

Apple has gone to great lengths to make sure software works on its new processors. If you use Apple apps such as iMovie Pages Keynote and more they will work on Apple silicon. Most third-party software from large corporations or from small developers will work. (The ways your software works on Apple silicon Macs is described in the next section.)

There are a few circumstances where your software may not work. If you are using an app that has not been updated in a long time it may not work. If you have custom-made software there could be issues. If you are still using an app that was discontinued there is a chance it will not run. Most of the initial compatibility problems seem to stem more from apps that were not updated to support macOS Big Sur which ships on Macs with the M1.

Before buying an Apple silicon Mac it is a good idea to check with the developers of your favorite apps for compatibility. The status of your software can help you determine whether you can invest now or you should wait. For example as of this writing Avid Pro Tools a popular audio editing suite is technically compatible with Apple silicon and macOS Big Sur under Rosetta but the company warns that “third-party plugins and other programs” may be incompatible and Pro Tools HDX and Pro Tools HD Native are not supported.

The website Is Apple silicon ready? maintains a list of software and their levels of compatibility. You can see if an app has a native version works in Rosetta2 or does not work at all

Can you explain native vs universal?

Software is created with specific hardware in mind. In the past software was made for Macs with Intel processors which use the x64 instruction set. Now software needs to be created for both Intel and Apple silicon (which uses the ARM instruction set) in order for the software to work efficiently and properly for each platform.

There are a few terms bandied about to describe the platform software is created for. Here are those terms and what they mean.

Native: Software that is written specifically for the platform it is being used on. Software that is native for Apple silicon runs only on Apple silicon. Learn more about native apps on Apple silicon.

Software that is written specifically for the platform it is being used on. Software that is native for Apple silicon runs only on Apple silicon. Learn more about native apps on Apple silicon. Universal: Software that is made to run on both Intel and Apple silicon Macs.

Software that is made to run on both Intel and Apple silicon Macs. Emulation: The ability to take an app written for one platform and translate it so that it works on another platform.

The ability to take an app written for one platform and translate it so that it works on another platform. Rosetta2: The name of the software translation tool Apple uses. Learn more about using apps under Rosetta2.

The first time you run a non-native app on an Apple silicon Mac an alert appears asking if you want to install Rosetta the translation layer needed to run the app. Once it is installed it works for all the apps that need it and you won’t see this alert again.

Do iPhone and iPad apps work on Apple silicon Macs?

They can. It is up to a developer whether they want to make their apps available for the Mac. To see if an iPhone/iPad app is available check the App Store on an Apple silicon Mac. (iPhone/iPad apps do not appear in the App Store for Intel Macs.) If you already paid for an app for your iPhone/iPad you do not have to buy it again.

Since the Mac doesn’t have a touchscreen Apple has Touch Alternatives to help you use an app; for example you use the Mac’s arrow keys to perform a swipe. iPhone apps run at a fixed window size while some iPad apps are resizable.

What version of macOS do Apple silicon Macs work with?

These new Macs come with macOS Monterey which is version 12 of the Mac operating system. They do not work with previous versions of macOS.

This could be an issue for users who prefer to use an older version of macOS. For example some users continue to use macOS Mojave because it is the last version to support 32-bit software. In this situation you need to upgrade those 32-bit apps to 64-bit versions or find 64-bit replacements before you can go with an M1 Mac.

Can Apple silicon Macs run Windows?

As of this writing Boot Camp does not work with Apple silicon Macs so you can’t boot into Windows. Apple has said that these Macs can do it but you would have to use Microsoft’s ARM version of Windows. Microsoft’s license currently does not allow for installation on a Mac so it’s up to Microsoft to decide to do it.

As for the virtualization method Parallels version 16.5 has support for the M1 but you can use only the ARM version of Windows. UTM is now available in the App Store ($10) and it will allow you to run ARM operating systems on M1 Macs. VMware announced that they are working on compatibility. CodeWeavers’ CrossOver virtualization works according to the company. CrossOver doesn’t emulate the Windows OS though. It allows the Mac to run software that was made for Windows. The developers of Wine are working with CodeWeavers to add a Windows compatibility layer to Wine 6.0.1. No announcement has been made about VirtualBox.

How do I transfer my data from an old Intel Mac to a new Apple silicon Mac?

This procedure has not changed because of Apple silicon. We have a guide that explains the ways you can quickly move everything from your old Intel Mac to your new M1 MacBook.

The M1 chip: Accessories

Will my hardware devices and accessories still work with Apple silicon Macs?

The Apple silicon Macs come with Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports. If you have been using a Mac with Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports you can connect to the new Macs the same way and your gear should work. The Thunderbolt/USB connectors are the same shape and have most of the same technical capabilities.

If you are using USB-A to USB-C adapters or a hub they should still work. Wireless devices on the new Mac can use the same wireless connection you have been using on the old Mac. If you are using high-end production equipment check with the device manufacturer about compatibility before you invest in a new Mac.

Can I connect external monitors to M1 Macs?

You can but there are limitations.

M1 Macs: One external display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz (There is a workaround for this which you can read about at Macworld U.K.)

One external display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz (There is a workaround for this which you can read about at Macworld U.K.) M1 Pro Macs: Up to two external displays with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz at over a billion colors

Up to two external displays with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz at over a billion colors M1 Max/Ultra Macs: Up to four external displays with up to 6K resolution and one external display with up to 4K resolution at 60Hz at over a billion colors

Can I use my case/cover/bag with Apple silicon laptops?

The M1 MacBook Air uses the design that was introduced in 2018. The M1 13-inch MacBook Pro uses the design that was implemented in 2016. If your gear is made for these laptops it will work with the new M1 laptops.

The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro are new designs so your old case or cover may not fit. Bags are usually more universal and shouldn’t be a problem.

The M1 chip: What’s ahead

Apple has two Macs that still need to be upgraded.

$1099 Mac mini: Apple could upgrade this Mac with an M1 Max to fill the lineup gap between the low-end Mac mini and the $1999 Mac Studio.

Apple could upgrade this Mac with an M1 Max to fill the lineup gap between the low-end Mac mini and the $1999 Mac Studio. Mac Pro: This will have some form the of the M1 Ultra. It will be configured in a way to meet the tremendous demands of Mac Pro users.

Nitrates and nitrites give processed meats their characteristic pink color and robust flavor. Although many consumers want to limit consumption of these preservatives because the substances can form potentially cancer-causing compounds knowing how much is in a food has been difficult to determine. Now researchers reporting in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces have developed a color-changing film that consumers can stick onto foods and easily analyze nitrite levels by snapping a picture with a smartphone.





Cured and processed meats such as salami and bacon are often treated with nitrite or nitrate salts to keep them looking and tasting fresh. Though nitrate is relatively stable it can be converted to the more reactive nitrite ion in the body. When in the acidic environment of the stomach or under the high heat of a frying pan nitrite can undergo a reaction to form nitrosamines which have been linked to the development of various cancers. Some methods to determine nitrite levels in foods already exist but they are not very consumer-friendly and often require expensive and laborious techniques and instruments. To help consumers make more informed decisions Saúl Vallejos José M. García and colleagues wanted to develop an easy-to-use nitrite quantification system.





To accomplish this the researchers developed a film they called “POLYSEN” which stands for “polymeric sensor” made of four monomers and hydrochloric acid. Disks punched from the material were placed on meat samples for 15 minutes allowing the monomer units and acid in the film to react with nitrite in a four-step azo coupling reaction. The disks were then removed and dipped in a sodium hydroxide solution for one minute to develop the color. When nitrite was present the film’s yellowish hue deepened with higher nitrite levels in the food. To quantitate the color change the researchers created a smartphone app that self-calibrates when a chart of reference disks is photographed in the same image as the sample disks.





The team tested the film on meats they prepared and treated with nitrite in addition to store-bought meats and found that the POLYSEN-based method produced results similar to those obtained with a traditional and more complex nitrite detection method. In addition POLYSEN complied with a European regulation for migration of substances from the film to the food. The researchers say the new approach could be a user-friendly and inexpensive way for consumers to determine nitrite levels in foods.

Want a surface that won't get wet? Grab some sandpaper.

Rice University researchers have developed a simple method to make surfaces superhydrophobic—that is very water-repellant—without the chemicals often used in such processes.

Their technique involves sandpaper a selection of powders and some elbow grease.

The labs of Rice professors C. Fred Higgs III and James Tour co-corresponding authors of a paper in the American Chemical Society journal ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces showed that sanding a surface increases its ability to shed water without getting wet. But grinding in a powder at the same time gives it hydrophobic superpowers.

Better yet their superhydrophobic surfaces also have excellent anti-icing properties. They found it took water 2.6 times longer to freeze on treated surfaces compared to untreated materials. They also noticed that ice lost 40% of its adhesion strength even in temperatures as low as minus 31 degrees Fahrenheit.

How well a surface absorbs or repels water can be measured by analyzing the contact angle of droplets that settle there. To be superhydrophobic a material has to have a water contact angle—the angle at which the surface of the water meets the surface of the material—larger than 150 degrees. The greater the beading the higher the angle. An angle of zero degrees is a puddle while a maximum angle of 180 degrees is a sphere that just touches the surface.

To achieve their super status hydrophobic materials have low surface energy as well as a rough surface. The Rice team's best materials showed a contact angle of about 164 degrees.

Higgs whose lab specializes in tribology the study of surfaces in sliding contact said certain types of sandpaper can provide surface roughness that promotes the desired water-repelling or hydrophobic behavior.

""However the Tour group's idea of introducing select powder materials between the rubbing surfaces during the sand-in process means a tribofilm is formed"" Higgs said. ""That gives the added bonus of functionalizing the surface to repel water ever more.""

A tribofilm forms in a chemical reaction on surfaces sliding against each other. The surface of an engine's piston is a good example he said. A video shows Rice alumnus Winston Wang sanding laser-induced graphene fibers into a polytetrafluoroethylene plate to make it superhydrophobic and sped-up footage of a water droplet freezing on the treated plate. The superhydrophobic process developed at Rice slows the formation of ice on treated surfaces by about 2.6 times. Credit: Courtesy of the Tour Group

Higgs said sanding roughens softer surfaces and allows the powders to adhere through van der Waals forces. ""These forces are at their greatest when surfaces come into close contact"" he said. ""Therefore powder particles can adhere even after the sand-in process is completed.""

Structural changes and mass and electron transfer appear to lower the surface energy of the materials that before treatment were already either mildly hydrophobic or hydrophilic according to the researchers.

The Rice team applied the technique on a variety of surfaces (Teflon polyethylene polypropylene polystyrene polyvinyl chloride and polydimethylsiloxane) with a variety of powder additives. These included laser-induced graphene fiber turbostratic flash graphene molybdenum disulfide Teflon and boron nitride. A variety of aluminum oxide sandpapers were used from 180- to 2000-grit.

The resistant materials proved to be robust as neither heating to 130 degrees Celsius (266 degrees Fahrenheit) nor 18 months under the hot Houston sun degraded them. Sticking transparent tape to the surface and peeling it off 100 times did not degrade them either. But even when the materials began to fail the labs found that re-sanding them could easily refresh their hydrophobicity.

The team also discovered that by changing the sand-in conditions and the powder additives materials can also be made hydrophilic or water-absorbing.

Tour said simplifying the manufacture of superhydrophobic and anti-icing materials should draw industry interest. ""It's hard to make these materials"" he said. ""Superhydrophobic surfaces do not permit water accumulation. The water beads and rolls right off if there is even the slightest angle or gentle wind.

""Now almost any surface can be made superhydrophobic in seconds"" Tour said. ""The powders can be as simple as Teflon or molybdenum disulfide both of which are readily available or newer graphene materials. Many industries could take advantage of this from builders of aircraft and boats to skyscrapers where low-ice adhesion is essential.""

""Airplane manufacturers do not want ice forming on their wings ship captains do not want drag from ocean water slowing them down and biomedical devices need to avoid biofouling where bacteria builds up on wet surfaces"" Higgs said. ""Robust long-lasting superhydrophobic surfaces produced from this one-step sand-in method can alleviate many of these problems.

""A limitation of other techniques to generate hydrophobic surfaces is that they do not scale up to large surface areas such as those on planes and ships"" he said. ""Simple application techniques like the one developed here should be scalable.""

Rice graduate student Weiyin Chen co-lead author of the new paper said the Tour lab has also applied its sand-in technique to various metal surfaces including as reported in another recent paper lithium and sodium foils for metal batteries.

""The spontaneous chemical reactions cause the formation of tribofilms in this case the artificial solid electrolyte interphase"" Chen said. ""The modified metals can be used as the anodes for rechargeable metal batteries.""

And that is why Arista Networks one of the upstart switch and router makers that was founded on the idea of creating an integrated networking software stack atop merchant silicon has acquired software-defined networking pioneer Pluribus Networks as it also reports a very good second quarter.

Pluribus Networks dropped out of stealth with server-switch hybrids back in early 2014 with the hopes of converging compute and networking into a single interconnected fabric it called Freedom. The Freedom server-switches mashed up switch ASICs and X86 CPUs into a single device with a converged network/compute operating system with the idea of eliminating latencies on the network as well as allowing for horizontal scaling of compute and network together much as hyperconverged storage mashes up virtualized compute and storage to allow it to scale.

The original Freedom switches which are historically interesting came in two flavors and spawned competitive “god box” offerings from Arista Networks Juniper Networks and Cisco Systems which we profiled way back in April 2015. One Freedom switch paired Broadcom’s Trident-2 ASIC with one Xeon E3 processor while the other had an Intel Alta FM6400 ASIC (from its Fulcrum Microsystems acquisition) matched to a two-socket Xeon E5 server. Depending on the configurations the Pluribus Freedom machines cost between $25000 and $80000 not including a KVM hypervisor which added another $10000 on top of that.

While the server-switch hybrid did not take off the ability to add software-defined functions to switches routers and other compute engines in the datacenter and telco network certainly did and Pluribus Networks dropped the hardware and focused on the Netvisor fabric it had created to stich the Freedom switches together. In recent years Pluribus Networks has partnered with Nvidia to move its software stack to Nvidia’s BlueField DPUs targeting service providers who want to offload networking functions from servers while at the same time making their compute farms more secure and do more application work. A little more than two years ago Arista Networks bought some of the assets of Big Switch Networks to add Big Cloud Fabric which it rebranded as Converged Cloud Fabric to its software stack.

However this Big Switch stack was not really designed for the kind of edge networking that is becoming more common among hyperscalers cloud builders service providers and large enterprises and after getting out of the server-switch hybrid business several years after emerging from stealth Pluribus Networks has spent years building just such software which Arista Networks is now calling its Unified Cloud Fabric.

This Unified Cloud Fabric formerly known as Adaptive Cloud Fabric is based on that Netvisor ONE stack and was co-developed in conjunction with telco switch maker Ericsson starting in 2016 and it has obviously evolved over the years to encompass other use cases and devices notably the concept of DPUs as the gatekeepers to storage and compute in the datacenter and as a secure endpoint on the network. Netvisor ONE runs on switches routers DPUs and other edge devices like 4G and 5G base stations and has been augmented with a DPU Fabric Manager that can span thousands of DPUs to configure manage and monitor them. The Unified Cloud Manager spans datacenters (including hybrid cloud setups) and can traverse both network underlays and overlays to present a single unified view of a network of all kinds of gear stitched together with software.

With the addition of Pluribus Networks Arista Networks has three different classes of customers that it can chase with its switch and routing hardware and its homegrown EOS switch operating system Big Switch fabric and telemetry software and now edge networking:

Of course many customers will employ multiple stacks to build different parts of their networks. Arista Networks did not divulge the financial details of the Pluribus Networks acquisition but the company raised $137 million in six rounds of funding – some of it before uncloaking a bunch of it in the years after uncloaking and $20 million of it in the fall of 2021 after it had pivoted to unifying the network at the edge and across DPUs. (And remember sometimes the cloud is an edge not a core when it comes to both compute and networking.) Pluribus Networks and Arista Networks have worked together for years and the latter is acquiring the former as much to get 140 software engineers and sales people as it is getting its hands on edge networking software.

That brings us to the second quarter numbers for Arista Networks.

In the June quarter Arista Networks had $885.8 million in product sales up 56.4 percent year on year with software licenses and services revenues of $185.1 million up 17.4 percent and software subscription sales of $19 million up 12.8 percent. If you just carve our services as a unit revenues were $166.1 million up 17.9 percent. Total sales were $1.05 billion up 48.7 percent and the first time Arista Networks brought through the nine digit dollar barrier in a quarter.

Net income rose nearly in lockstep with sales up 51.9 percent to $299.1 million which represented 28.4 percent of revenues down a bit from prior quarters but still a pretty healthy return.

Arista Networks did not disclose a price for the Pluribus Networks when the announcement was made but it did burn $522 million in cash during the quarter which may or may not be an indication. The company did buy $483.7 million of its own stock in the quarter and if you do the math that would suggest that it paid somewhere around $337 million for Pluribus Networks and another small networking company called Untangled (with only ten employees) in the quarter. That suggestion would be wrong. The 10-Q just posted a few days after the announcement was made and Arista Networks paid $150 million for both companies.

Now on to the talk about the supply chain. Sales and therefore profits at Arista Networks are very much constrained by supply chain woes as has been the case for several years now.

“We have left no stone unturned in supply purchase commitments” Jayshree Ullal the company’s chief executive officer. “They just keep going higher and higher. This quarter we reported $4.5 billion. So there is no lack of desire in Arista’s part to fulfill the demand we have. We are clearly going in with strong demand strong backlog et cetera. However we need all the components to come together and the component problem continues. It has been bad in Q1. It’s no better in Q2 and we’re not foreseeing much improvement in Q3. So perhaps in 2023 we will get some relief. But again to get relief we have to have all the components come. If we’re missing one component we can’t build a system. So our guide reflects that and our behavior in how we acquire components is reflecting that. We’re still not getting the components. Many of the components have 70-week lead times and therefore we have to plan multiple quarters and years for that.”

With the hyperscalers and cloud builders all wanting to do massive 400 Gb/sec Ethernet rollouts inside of their datacenters as well as invest in datacenter interconnect (DCI) pipes between their datacenters and regions it would be interesting to know how much business is on the table that cannot be fulfilled by Arista Networks or any of its competitors as they stare down this uncooperative supply chain.

One thing that Arista Networks is not worried about is the Intel Xeon SP product cycle and specifically the rumored delays with the “Sapphire Rapids” Xeon SPs which is a rerun of the “Ice Lake” Xeon SP delay in 2019 and 2020 that had a big impact on Arista Networks.

“The last time we experienced this with Facebook as many of you may remember it was a little more nightmarish scenario for us” Ullal conceded. “Because of delays they skipped an entire server cycle and Arista certainly felt it – that sneeze turned into pneumonia for us. But this time around I think there are many more competitive options.”

And we certainly see that in the financials for both Intel and AMD and expect AMD will continue to eat market share as much as its wafer agreements with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co will allow and Intel will be able to mop up whatever is left with Ice Lake and even earlier generations of Xeon SPs. The chip that has the best performance is the one you can actually get your hands on these days. Ditto for the switch.",,,,,,,,,,,,

(1:02)

Open Extended Reactions

Bill Belichick and Robert Kraft were front and center Sunday in what appeared to be a happy reunion during the live roast of Tom Brady.

But according to two former players who attended the roast the former New England Patriots coach and the longtime team owner also shared some awkward moments offstage.

Julian Edelman and Drew Bledsoe discussed the three-hour roast during the latest episode of Edelman's ""Games with Names"" podcast and described the scene in the green room before the event.

""Preshow we're in the green room -- remember that? Were you in there?"" Edelman asked Bledsoe. ""Bill's opening up. He's having fun he's talking war stories talking rookie skits talking fun s--- doing s--- we know what Bill's all about but it was like amplified because he was excited to see you guys because he doesn't have a job anymore.""

Edelman and Bledsoe said they were both in the green room with Belichick along with former Patriots stars Rob Gronkowski and Randy Moss when Kraft arrived.

""Then Kraft walks in ... Belichick's kind of holding court"" Bledsoe recalled. ""As he's in the middle of the story Kraft walks in and so you guys all go over to say hi to Kraft.""

""The tension in that room though could cut f---ing glass"" Edelman said.

Edelman said he tried to give Belichick a ""head's up"" when he saw Kraft walk into the green room but that Belichick did not pick up on the cue.

""[Kraft] came in and I was like 'Oh s--- there's gonna be some fireworks'"" Edelman said. ""I just walked away. I didn't want to get in there.""

Bledsoe added that Belichick and Kraft did at one point ""break it down and got together for I don't know 10 minutes at least."" But the former Patriots quarterback agreed with Edelman's assessment about the tension in the room saying ""it was very real it was very real.""

Belichick and Kraft drank a shot together on stage at one point with some coaxing from comedian Kevin Hart during Sunday's made-for-streaming live comedy show on Netflix titled ""The Greatest Roast of All Time.""

Belichick left the Patriots in January after 24 seasons with the team and there has been reported friction between the six-time Super Bowl-winning coach and Kraft over the past couple of years.

As part of an ESPN report published last month that detailed Belichick's departure from the Patriots and his inability to land the Atlanta Falcons' head-coaching job a source said Kraft called Falcons owner Arthur Blank ""to warn him not to trust Bill.""

The Falcons interviewed Belichick twice this offseason for their vacant head-coaching position before ultimately hiring Raheem Morris for the job.

After joking about the event being like a reunion and that ""unlike many family reunions there are some people I am desperately trying to avoid"" Kraft praised Belichick for what the two accomplished.

""I want to say this is the greatest coach in the history of the game that did what no one else has done. And having Tom Brady and him was the greatest honor the good Lord gave me"" Kraft said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvY2xpbWF0ZS90cnVtcC1vaWwtZ2FzLW1hci1hLWxhZ28uaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,At a Dinner Trump Assailed Climate Rules and Asked $1 Billion From Big Oil,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.nytimes.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2024/05/09/climate/trump-oil-gas-mar-a-lago.html (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D81D02A10>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvY2xpbWF0ZS90cnVtcC1vaWwtZ2FzLW1hci1hLWxhZ28uaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvYm9laW5nLWpldC1za2lkcy1vZmYtcnVud2F5LWluanVyaW5nLWF0LWxlYXN0LTEw0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9ib2VpbmctamV0LXNraWRzLW9mZi1ydW53YXktaW5qdXJpbmctYXQtbGVhc3QtMTAuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boeing jet skids off runway injuring at least 10,"A Boeing 737 skidded off a runway at an airport in Senegal’s capital injuring at least 11 people and grounding all operations while crew assisted with an evacuation of the aircraft.

The plane skidded into the grass that flanked the runway where crew were able to deploy the side exit ramps and ferry passengers off the plane as it started to burn.

""Our plane just caught fire at Blaise Diagne airport"" Cheick Siriman Sissoko a Malian musician wrote in a post on Facebook along with a video of rescue crews helping passengers evacuate the plane. An orange glow is visible under the jet.

The plane was carrying 79 passengers two pilots and four cabin crew according to Ndiaye. The airport has opened an investigation to determine the cause of the accident the Independent reported.

""Carriers operate and maintain their airplanes for upwards of 30 to 40 years"" Boeing said in a statement to FOX Business referring to TransAir for further questions but assuring that the company ""will provide any requested support to our customers.""

Leo Lukenas III a former Green Beret who was part of the bank’s Financial Institutions Group died of “acute coronary artery thrombus” at age 35 last Thursday according to a Reuters report.

He leaves behind a wife and two young children.

His death came after he had allegedly been working some 100 hours a week for several weeks in a row on a $2 billion merger that was completed last Monday — three days before his tragic death.

Much of the outcry on social media site Reddit from purported bank staffers has been directed at Lukenas’ boss Gary Howe co-head of the financial institutions group. Howe took down his LinkedIn page during the last few days.

Some employees have reportedly messaged each other about a possible walkout in an effort to bargain for better working conditions according to popular financial website and chat board Wall Street Oasis.

One post from an anonymous banker highlighted a list of demands for employees’ welfare that generated more than 450 comments in response.

The demands include “proactive policies” that cap work schedules at an average of 80 hours over a seven-day period and that employees get at least one weekend off per month. It also called for an investigation into Lukenas’ death.

So far workers have remained at their desks — in part because they fear retribution for raising concerns about the toxic culture sources said.

A Bank of America spokesperson did not comment about a possible walkout or the accusations of retribution when reached by The Post.

The rep said the bank has no plans to take any action against Howe or to investigate complaints that its junior bankers are forced to put in 100-hour weeks.

“We are very saddened by the loss of our teammate. We continue to focus on doing whatever we can to support the family and our team especially those who worked closely with him” the BoA spokesperson told The Post.

Howe did not reply to multiple requests for comment.

Lukena who lived in Brooklyn had been a Green Beret for more than a decade — from 2013 until he joined the bank as a full-time employee last July — according to his LinkedIn page.

He posted news about the deal between UMB Financial and Heartland Financial on LinkedIn days before his death.

He was a member of 51 Vets a nonprofit dedicated to connecting transitioning and transitioned veterans from elite military communities with leading businesses according to its website.

“51 Vets completely changed the trajectory of my post military career. Outstanding organization with an incredible mission” Lukenas had recently posted on LinkedIn.

A fundraiser for his family launched by 51 Vets has already raised $258962 as of early Thursday afternoon including $10000 from hedge fund titan Bill Ackman.

“This was an organic campaign organized by our members” 51 Vets founder Jordan Selleck told The Post.

“This speaks to the pain in the veteran community and Leo’s reputation in the community.”

“On May 2nd 2024 51 Vets lost a father husband son Green Beret and member” 51 Vets says on its site.

“Leo left behind a wife and two young children. Leo spent over a decade in Army Special Operations deploying multiple times with 1st Special Forces Group. He was dedicated to everything he did never settling for good enough. He always set the example and held himself to the highest standards prioritizing the team and mission success over himself.”

Lukenas’ dedication to work is why some on Wall Street are quick to link his passing to a culture they believe values wealth over well-being.

While there is no direct evidence to suggest his work had anything to do with his death numerous studies have linked acute stress to thrombosis.

Lukenas’ shocking death reopened a longstanding debate on Wall Street about a bank’s responsibility to employees.

More than a decade ago Moritz Erhardt a 21-year-old intern at Bank of America in London died after working until 6 a.m. three nights in a row.

A coroner concluded that Erhardt’s death from an epileptic seizure that limited his oxygen supply may have been triggered by fatigue.

Following his death banks made an effort to restrict employee work hours.

That discussion was reignited in 2021 after a PowerPoint presentation compiled by 13 Goldman Sachs junior bankers and calling out brutal workweeks leaked to the popular Wall Street influencer Litquidity.

“What is not ok to me is 110-120 hours over the course of a week! The math is simple that leaves 4 hours for eating sleeping showering bathroom and general transition time. This is beyond the level of ‘hard-working’ it is inhuman/ abuse” one analyst wrote at the time.

In response banks began hiring more staff to lighten junior employees’ workloads and limit hours.

But over the last year as Wall Street profits dropped and firms prepared for a possible recession several banks — including Bank of America — cut the workforce once again.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbGlzaC5jb20vZm9vZC1uZXdzL2E2MDc0NDU5NS90cmF2aXMta2VsY2UtY2xhaW1zLWFsd2F5cy1kcnVuay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Travis Kelce Is Clapping Back At Claims He's 'Always Drunk',"Earlier this week country singer and actor Jana Kramer took to her podcast to well slander Travis Kelce's name. The iHeart Radio host dissed the Kansas City Chiefs tight end for his drinking habits and claimed he's ""always drunk."" Now Kelce is hitting back via multiple insiders.

""He was taken aback as he’s never met her and is just living his life"" the source told Page Six while ""emphatically"" denying any suggestion the athlete has a drinking problem. ""That guy is under a microscope basically being watched everywhere he goes. Of course you're going to see him drinking"" the source said.

Kramer even took aim at Kelce's influence on his girlfriend Taylor Swift arguing that he has encouraged the singer's consumption habits.

""I see her drinking more now. Like the company you keep"" Kramer alleged while also calling Kelce out for his ""aggression"" with coach Andy Reid during the Super Bowl. It ""rubbed [her] the wrong way.""

The same insider went on to argue that if Kelce did have a drinking problem it would be impossible to hide given his status and constant

""It’s not like he’s passed out somewhere. If he was passed out somewhere I would totally understand but that’s not the case whatsoever"" the source adds while noting that he's just a ""normal human being"" who is ""doing the same thing"" as everyone else...only ""in the public eye.""

The three-time Super Bowl champ is reportedly ""in training right now"" to prepare for another season with the Chiefs. ""If he was drunk it would be a bigger problem"" the source said.

This isn't the first time Kelce has come under fire for drinking. During his honorary graduation ceremony for his ""New Heights"" podcast Travis accepted the diploma he never picked up in the first place before chugging a beer in celebration. However big brother Jason was quick to his defense.

""I know it looks like a graduation from the video but this was actually at the end of a New Heights Live podcast that we put on to raise money for the University’s NIL"" the older Kelce said according to People Magazine. ""The university did this to poke fun at my brother and I for never really picking up our diplomas."""

In this article we’ll review the latest capabilities in this extension for Autodesk Civil 3D. You’ll also find a collection of highly informative resources. Let’s have a look at what’s New in Grading Optimization 2023.1:

Pathways. New to Grading Optimization are Pathways – objects that represent sidewalks driveways and other linear methods of ingress and egress paths. Once pathways are placed you can determine the width slope and cross slope of the path allowing you to control the steepness of a path and limit its pitch to either side.

Pathway object in Grading Optimization for Civil 3D

Ridge Lines. New objects that represent a linear elevation that directs drainage away from its placement. During optimization the Ridge Line creates an elevation to repel drainage unlike the Drain Line object which attracts and directs drainage.

Isolate Internal Zone Drainage. You can now isolate drainage objects (drain lines low points and ridge lines) within a zone from affecting optimization outside of the zone boundaries.

Other enhancements:

Building pads now have a specific property to drain water away from the pad.

Ponds now have a property to define the maximum storage depth of both wet and dry ponds.

Since its reveal at PlayStation’s PS5 games showcase in September 2020 Hogwarts Legacy-related details have surfaced piecemeal.

WB Games and developer Avalanche Software lifted the lid further a few months ago finally offering a glimpse at gameplay customization and exploration.

And even in the absence of concrete release date details more about the new Wizarding World adventure continues to bubble to the surface.

Autodesk’s two-day Virtual Vision Series kicked off yesterday August 3 and featured a Hogwarts Legacy presentation from Avalanche Software wherein the team detailed its technical tools and development pipeline.

YouTuber BNS_Victory [LEEUW] posted the nearly hour-long presentation on their channel. Since the team conducted the session via Zoom the video quality isn’t exactly top-notch.

However those looking forward to Hogwarts Legacy will still find some hidden gems. Twitter user Hogwarts Legacy News shared one snippet in particular featuring two students attempting to rescue a Hippogriff.

In the video the Hippogriff is stunned and hauled away by what appears to be dark wizards. (This moment appears around the 44:40 timestamp in the YouTube video.)

Much about Hogwarts Legacy remains under wraps though a recent leak unveiled the alleged contents of its Collector’s Edition.

Apparently the higher-end special edition will include a host of digital goodies in addition to a steelbook case three days of early access and a Floating Ancient Magic Wand with Book.

For now there’s no word on when WB Games plans to announce its launch plans for the upcoming role-playing title."

Analyses can be available just minutes after the drive – or indeed during it. And the share of measurement data evaluated live can be increased before any archiving occurs.

The tradition at Porsche is for a new vehicle model to be tested not only by the development engineers but also by many staff in the testing and quality departments. The testers can now provide their feedback even faster: anyone who finds an opti­mization opportunity turns off the vehicle taps their smartphone and records a voice memo. For example: “Seat heating in level 1 too warm.” A few moments later the department responsible receives an e­mail with the comment which has been automatically converted into text. The engineers can also access all the measurement data from the vehicle as a mobile network is used to send it to a central server. This means that the feedback can be checked quickly and if necessary a software customization can be devel­ oped for the vehicle.

This live optimization is made possible by the Porsche Engineering Data Service (PEDS): This system connects the international test vehicles with the devel­ opers and thereby makes measurement data analysis considerably easier. To use the service all that needs to be done in the test vehicle is to connect what is known as a ComBox in addi­tion to the measurement system or data logger which can be done in just a few simple steps. The device for­ wards the data from the integrated measuring devices to a PEDS server using a mobile network (LTE/5G) or WiFi. There the data is processed and automatically evaluated. “This is a plug­and­play digitization pro­ cess” explains Björn Pehnert Manager Digitization and initiator of the PEDS project at Porsche Engineering.

Dispensind with manual processes

The ComBox eliminates the need for many manual processes during the testing phase for example during transfer of the measured values that were collected: a data logger in the vehicle for example records a significant volume of data each and every minute capturing camera images pressure and temperature data as needed in addition to the communication between the control units. Previously removable media were used to transfer the measurement data to stationary PCs (readout stations) automatically. “Data loggers provide raw data that can only be eval­ uated after conversion” explains Stephan Gehrmann Manager Automation Measurement Technology depart­ ment at Porsche AG. In the final step the developers selected the relevant data and analyzed it interactively. If testing was performed at a different location and a business trip was necessary several days could pass before the first findings from a test drive were available.

Thanks to PEDS data transfer and analysis now takes only minutes. One factor that saves time is the fact that the ComBox transmits measurement data so swiftly: The delay only totals 15 to 20 seconds for small volumes of data. Another factor is that all subsequent work steps now proceed automatically: PEDS converts the raw data and filters out the data that is relevant to the department. For example the interior climate plays no role in chassis optimization. Finally automatic analysis is carried out. For this process the tools already in use at the specialist departments are integrated into the overall solution. “We didn’t reinvent anything but rather integrated the existing know-how into a digital process” explains Pehnert. “For example PEDS can automatically feed data into the existing simulation of a component.”

Automation not only ensures shorter response times but also helps significantly build up the data-base at the same time which is evaluated promptly and automatically. Around 150 test vehicles are already connected to the server by means of a ComBox and by the end of the year around the same number again is expected to have been added. This means faster availability of data for developers – and this at all locations since all the international measurement data flows into a common pool for example into Porsche’s in-house measurement data and testing platform ‘Cluu’. Whereas each specialist department previously had only a handful of test vehicles at its disposal other teams can now systematically supply the engineers with relevant data. To do this the developers only need to have the authorizations necessary to use the data. An engineer in Weissach for example is actively alerted to an anomaly in measurement data collected by colleagues in Anting China. This makes it possible to test and implement new functions much faster.

PEDS also makes it easier to create and compare digital twins these being simulations of components. The developers at Porsche Engineering have created one such model of the high-voltage battery of an electric vehicle for example. Its thermal response is exactly the same as a real power storage unit. This model with 37 parameters was optimized with the help of PEDS: data from the test vehicle flowed into the mathematical simulation while the vehicle was still on the road allowing ongoing improvements to be made. The result: the error value – i.e. the deviation between the real and simulated behavior of the battery – was halved. “The fact that processes like this are now possible ‘live’ is a real breakthrough” says Pehnert.

Digital Optimization Loops

Because the digital twin of a component operates so realistically it can effectively supplement real experiments and in some cases actually replace them altogether. It can be used for example to optimize the design and arrangement of the cooling plates in the high-voltage battery. To actually build all the options in this case would be impossible. “Digitally however the optimization loops can be run in seconds” Pehnert explains. “Even the response of the battery in a prototype that doesn’t even exist yet can be simulated and perfected.”

To optimize driving comfort test vehicles are often equipped with accelerometers. In some cases they are secured in places that can only be reached when the vehicle is disassembled. During the test drive sensors may occasionally shift slightly. This is a tricky situation because the sensor concerned usually doesn’t fail completely but continues to provide data. While the data stills seems plausible it’s no longer reliable. “Even an experienced engineer often fails to recognize this” explains PEDS developer Jonas Brandstetter from Porsche Engineering. In the past errors like this were only identified weeks after the drive which meant that testing had to be repeated – requiring enormous efforts particularly when testing in remote areas.

PEDS ensures this can no longer happen: The system checks the measurement data for anomalies while the vehicle is still on the road. This is done by using an AI algorithm on the server which has learned from a few data sets what a correct sensor signal looks like enabling it to detect erroneous measurements. If the algorithm fails the test engineer receives a push message on the smartphone and can cancel the test run.

PEDS has already been successfully tested in 15 use cases across all disciplines – from chassis optimization to global defect analysis at quality stations. But the system’s potential is far from exhausted. “We are now looking at scaling it up” reports Pehnert. Setting up a network integrating the Volkswagen Group’s measurement data management system is therefore currently on the agenda. PEDS is already connected to the ‘Cluu’ measurement data and test platform. Access to the measurement data from Porsche’s data loggers is already available here. There are also plans to further simplify the wireless transmission of measurement data. The idea is to use WiFi to transmit the data from the measuring devices to the Speech2Text smartphone in the vehicle and from there to PEDS. In some calibration this could obviate the need for a ComBox in the test vehicle.

Summary

The Porsche Engineering Data Service (PEDS) connects the test vehicles that are operating all over the world with the developers. Using the ComBox specially developed for this purpose data can be sent to the PEDS servers almost in real time where it is processed and automatically evaluated. This reduces the amount of work and shortens development times considerably.

How employers can step in,"Adrienne Schneider was at the pinnacle of her career. She held a leadership position for an airline company and was in the midst of starting her own company.

But in February 2020 her father’s health began to decline.

As an only child whose mother had died over 20 years before she had no other choice but to care for her father full-time. She left her job in June of that year. Her father was diagnosed with ALS shortly after and roughly a month later put on a feeding tube making him dependent on others for all of his daily care. She was his full-time caregiver until he passed away in February 2021.

“My father really only really had me” Schneider says. “It was progressing so quickly I felt like I was racing against the machine that I couldn’t even see.”

For Schneider it was only after she left her job that she realized how difficult it would have been to have dual responsibilities. She was working over 60 hours a week at her job and her dad needed 24/7 care. Her employer did not offer benefits to help employees with caregiving assistance solutions and leaving her job became the only way to provide the level of care her dad needed something she hopes others in a similar position don’t have to do.

Caregivers need support so they can keep their jobs and be present for loved ones and that support can start at the office Schneider says who is now on the board of directors for Family First managing employee caregiving benefits which allows workers to lean on an expert caregiver when they need it. This expert will help the employee manage options when it comes to an aging parent or a child with special needs. Family First is made free to all employees once it is implemented and it partners with a company’s benefits team to integrate emails webinars and resources into employees’ onboarding giving them access to a mobile app and digital tools.

Family First’s assistance can help people locate and obtain a nurse for an individual something that would have lightened Schneider’s load she says. They can also help decipher insurance options.

“As important as it is to make sure you’ve got the right diagnosis and that the care is being done there are just much bigger issues that have to do with all the family dynamics that relate to caregiving” says Evan Falchuk CEO of Family First expanding on his own experience caring for his father while managing his mother’s expectations and emotions. “There’s no caregiving for dummies.”

Family First began offering benefit services in 2018 to companies the majority being Fortune 500 serving over 1 million people across the nation. The caregiver’s support person has diverse expertise something that helps with the wide array of caregiving needs people are currently facing. While the actual cost of care is through insurance and not the benefit Family First hopes to make employees aware of their options and alleviate the stress that comes with being unprepared because caregivers say you don’t understand the toll it takes unless you’ve been there.

As the sole decision-maker on behalf of her father Schneider helped turn her father’s home into a patient care center practically overnight and helped assemble five different machines for him. She did everything in her power to provide the correct care as she unexpectedly became a full-time caretaker while also grappling with the emotional reality that her father’s health was bound to get worse.

“I found myself in a position where I felt like a nurse the respiratory therapist a physical therapist an occupational therapist learning how to administer food” Schneider says. “This roller coaster that I never thought I would have found myself in looking back six months prior.”

The nation’s caregivers

As the U.S. population ages more adult children serve as caretakers for their loved ones than ever before—many of whom already hold numerous titles such as worker and parent.

According to estimates from the Urban Institute 1 in 5 adults will be 65 or older by 2040 exacerbating the nation’s caregiving problem. The number of Americans providing unpaid care has increased from 43.5 million in 2015 to 53 million in 2020. In 2020 more Americans provided care for more than one person and more cared for someone with Alzheimer’s disease or dementia as opposed to five years prior according to the American Association for Retired People.

Today more than half of Americans in their 40s are sandwiched between an aging parent and their children. Data from the Automatic Data Processing (ADP) found that workers are more stressed at work as compared to before the pandemic. This is largely because of the increasing number of workers becoming caregivers says Kristen Appleman senior vice president of ADP. Roughly seven in 10 (67%) workers say they experience stress at work at least once a week up from 62% pre-pandemic. One in seven (15%) feels stressed every day according to the report.

“While schedule and location flexibility is a benefit and policy that needs to be carefully examined by employers workers also need the resources in place to obtain both ongoing and urgent care in a health and childcare system that is already strained” says Appleman.

Like Schnieder caregivers are forced to balance the health decisions family dynamics financial burdens and grief all in one.

Compared to 2015 more family caregivers rated their health as “fair to poor” in 2020 which experts say has grown due to the increasing caregiving problem from the pandemic coupled with remote work. In the pandemic women were disproportionately pushed out of the workforce.

Women take the brunt

The caregiving burden disproportionately affects women; women make up roughly 75% of the nation’s caregivers.

“It always falls on the women and that is something that nobody talks about” says Pamela D. Wilson a caregiving expert highlighting the emotional and financial strain. “Women who have children take years out of the workforce then they end up taking care of their elderly parents. Women shouldn’t be the ones who end up in nursing homes on Medicaid at the end of their life because there’s nobody to take care of them and they have no income.”

Experts point to the dire economic implications.

“This economic toll underscores why poverty in old age has such a distinctly female face” says Jeffrey Lewis President and CEO of Legacy Health Endowment in a statement.

This comes as 82.2% of people are concerned about losing their jobs because of their caregiving responsibilities with 71.8% saying their responsibilities have impacted their own overall physical health according to the Legacy Health Endowment which surveyed women caretakers. The caregiver is largely forgotten experts tell Fortune.

Sara MacDonald who also now works with Family First was a single working mother and caregiver since her 20s. She describes it as simply as not knowing what she didn’t know—like how she had to call 50 transportation companies to figure out how to cover the cost for her son’s after-school program. She felt utterly unprepared for caring for her son who needed extra help and wasn’t developing like his peers. The out-of-pocket costs were astronomical and she felt like nothing was ever enough.

“I remember wishing I could split myself in half or have someone to count on” MacDonald says. “You start to sacrifice your own sanity.”

The Family First benefit helps employees navigate a variety of after-school programs and community-based organizations.

For Schneider she wishes she had been prepared and had the steps in place to deal with a situation far out of her expertise that would’ve let her continue working. In her role now she can attest companies lose talented people who may all of a sudden be seen as “low performers” like “their heads aren’t in the game” or as if they’re “slacking.” In reality they are managing an enormous hidden task of caregiving that employers must take seriously now more than ever she says.

“I had no idea that I was moving from one stressful full-time job to another” Schneider says. “I felt like I had to be the perfect caregiver and learn how to manage my father’s care in the same fashion that I treated my job. My father often said that he didn’t know who he should worry about more himself or me.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hvcGVkaWEuY29tLzIvMzIwMDkvdHJlbmRzL2JpZy1kYXRhL2F1dG9tYXRpb24tdGhlLWZ1dHVyZS1vZi1kYXRhLXNjaWVuY2UtYW5kLW1hY2hpbmUtbGVhcm5pbmfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Automation: The Future of Data Science and Machine Learning?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.techopedia.com/2/32009/trends/big-data/automation-the-future-of-data-science-and-machine-learning on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hvcGVkaWEuY29tLzIvMzIwMDkvdHJlbmRzL2JpZy1kYXRhL2F1dG9tYXRpb24tdGhlLWZ1dHVyZS1vZi1kYXRhLXNjaWVuY2UtYW5kLW1hY2hpbmUtbGVhcm5pbmfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNTk4LTAyMi0xNjcxMC010gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Convolutional neural networks for the automatic segmentation of lumbar paraspinal muscles in people with low back ...,"Four CNN models (2D and 3D models with and without data augmentation) were trained and tested for automatic segmentation of the lumbar paraspinal muscles from axial T 2 -weighted images. All models were trained using a modified U-Net architecture designed for image segmentation. Overall CNN segmentation accuracy was high and the reliability was excellent for each model compared to the ground truth (Sørensen-Dice index ≥ 0.885 ICC 21 ≥ 0.941). Furthermore we provide evidence for higher performance using 2D compared to 3D models and higher performance for models trained without data augmentation versus with data augmentation. The 2D model trained without data augmentation demonstrated the highest average CNN segmentation accuracy across the muscles (Sørensen-Dice index ≥ 0.900 ICC 21 ≥ 0.941).

Compared to Shen et al. (2021) we demonstrated improved outcomes for the erector spinae but slightly inferior performance for the multifidus and psoas major13. Their model however was limited to one axial slice (L4-L5 intervertebral disc level). In contrast our approach included the entire superior-inferior expanse of the lumbar paraspinal muscles (L1-L5 vertebral levels) allowing us to capture 3D information of muscle morphometry which provides a more complex and complete representation of the lumbar spine anatomy.

In agreement with Desai et al. (2019) we provide further evidence for higher performance of 2D (M × N × 1) over 3D (M × N × 32) models19. The 3D models in general had higher volume ratios lower conformity index and lower positive predictive values compared to the 2D models which suggests the 3D models were likely including more false-positive voxels leading to larger segmentations. The lower performance of the 3D models may be partially explained by the anisotropic resolution of the images with a slice thickness of 5.0 mm and an in-plane resolution of 0.39 × 0.39 mm2 and 3D segmentation models have been shown to perform suboptimally when slice resolution is much larger than the between-slice resolution21. In fact relatively small isotropic (3 × 3 × 3) 3D convolutional filter sizes may not be able to learn useful features from anisotropic voxels due to the varying information density along each dimension22.

Next in 3D models the stochastic approximation of the gradient of the loss function is updated on larger inputs (i.e. the gradient of the loss function is updated on lower number of model parameters per voxel relatively)23. As such the 3D networks could provide less specific and accurate gradient calculations.

Finally 3D segmentation models use more computationally complex convolutions allowing depth-wise features (along the z-axis) to be extracted throughout the network resulting in a higher GPU memory footprint1024. We chose a batch size to approximate maximal computational capacity and equivalent GPU memory footprint between models. As such we used a limited batch size (n = 10 number of samples = 1) for our 3D models which may have led to less stable feature regularization compared to our 2D models (n = 50 number of samples = 4)19. Regularization is a technique to reduce the generalization error by including a penalty term to prevent the model of overfitting to the training data as a result of complex co-adaptations of model units25. Batch normalization is most commonly used in deep learning for regularization but appears to lead to inaccurate batch estimation and higher model error in smaller batch sizes26. Hence we used instance normalization (i.e. normalizing the feature maps per image) for all models to ensure that the contrast is not skewed by batched images with different input image contrast ranges2627. However CNN performance between different normalization techniques across different batch sizes in training CNNs for the segmentation of paraspinal muscles remains unclear. More research should be conducted to investigate CNN paraspinal muscle segmentation performance across different normalization techniques and batch sizes.

If memory costs for volumetric 3D convolutions can be reduced the CNN performance for 3D models is likely to improve as optimizing 3D training parameters will be less restricted by total GPU memory. Several options have been suggested to reduce GPU memory costs for volumetric 3D convolutions. First 2.5D (M × N × t) convolutions have been suggested to include volumetric information without the increase in network size28. The 2.5D network uses a stack of t continuous 2D slices across different orthogonal planes to segment the central slice. However 2.5D networks may also perform suboptimally in anisotropic imaging datasets28. As such more research needs to be conducted to investigate the validity of 2.5D networks for the segmentation of paraspinal muscles in anisotropic datasets. Second implementing automatic mixed precision (AMP) training offers significant computational speedup and lowers GPU memory footprints by performing the operation in half-precision (float16) format and storing minimal information in single-precision (float32) in critical parts of the network29. AMP has been shown to be effective for reducing the GPU memory footprint and efficiency of CNN training while maintaining model accuracy29. Future research needs to be conducted to optimize the trade-off point between performance and computational costs in CNN training on biomedical volumes of the paraspinal muscles.

While data augmentation has been used to increase network expressivity we provide further evidence it may reduce precision in a homogenous dataset with a standardized imaging acquisition protocol similar to findings reported elsewhere19. In other words due to equivalent imaging and clinical parameters between our training and testing dataset data augmentation could result in an overestimation of imaging and anatomical heterogeneity. More research should be conducted to investigate optimal data augmentation parameters in more heterogenous imaging datasets where data augmentation may improve model performance and generalizability.

Improved performance was not realized with a deeper CNN network architecture (one extra network layer with 512 filters). It remains questionable if deeper and more complex networks are specifically needed for paraspinal muscle segmentation. Other recent work on training CNNs on thigh muscle volumes showed that deeper networks with short-cut connections and variety of convolutional block structures only led to marginal CNN improvements30. One explanation is that high-level information captured with deep layers of the network may not contribute as much to the results as the low-level image features such as edges and contrast30. Future research to optimize the trade-off point between network depth number of filters per layer and segmentation performance in training 2D and 3D CNN models for paraspinal muscle segmentation is needed.

There was a significant main effect for muscles with the multifidus having the lowest average CNN segmentation accuracy across all models. This difference can be explained by the relative magnitude of downsampling within the network with respect to the total volume of the muscles20. Compared to the erector spinae and psoas major the multifidus has significantly smaller muscle volume. Hence the multifidus could be exposed to more feature loss of spatial context information in the deeper layers where the receptive fields of the filters compromises more high-level features20. Furthermore the multifidus appears to have high anatomical variability between and within participants17. As such it is more challenging for a CNN to learn the delineation of the multifidus compared to the erector spinae and psoas major across the entire expanse of the lumbar spine. Future work will focus on developing different CNN models to improve the segmentation accuracy for muscles with relatively small region of interest and high anatomical variability.

The CNN with the highest segmentation performance across all muscles (2D without data augmentation) reached human-level performance and was highly time-efficient. While not used in this study post-processing transformations (through spatial connection and closing analysis) can reduce false-positive classified voxels by retaining the largest dense connected 3D-volume for each muscle30. These transformations can be helpful for clinical implementation to further improve CNN accuracy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlbGlndXkuY29tL2Jsb2dzL3Bvc3RzL2RqaS10ZXJyYS11cGRhdGUtZHJvbmUtc3VydmV5LWRhdGEtbmF0aW9uYWwtY29vcmRpbmF0ZS1zeXN0ZW3SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DJI Terra Update: Convert Drone Survey Data Into National Coordinate System,"DJI Terra firmware update enables users to accurately convert raw L1 and P1 drone survey data into a national coordinate system;

This key upgrade streamlines this stage of the processing workflow - meaning that DJI Terra can now be used to accurately transform data from the WGS 84 global coordinate system rather than having to do this in an alternative software platform like Terrasolid.

This provides a seamless end-to-end process inside DJI Terra for surveyors who want to generate a raw LiDAR or photogrammety point cloud in a localised coordinate system. However additional cleaning and classification still needs to be done through a platform like Terrasolid if required.

Test data from heliguy™ shows that DJI Terra's coordinate conversion is now just as accurate as doing this switch in Terrasolid.

The heliguy™ in-house surveying team - which has compiled a free online L1 LiDAR course including data processing in DJI Terra/Terrasolid - has previously suggested to DJI that Terra be given national coordinate system functionality. We are pleased that this features in the latest round of updates.

Other key upgrades as part of the new firmware update (Version: 3.5.0) include added functionality to refine water surfaces for 3D Reconstruction; and added Merged Output option to merge output results in PLY LAS or PCD format for point cloud reconstruction.

Read our in-depth guide to drone mapping with DJI Terra for full firmware update details and more information on the drone data processing platform.

DJI Terra Coordinate Conversion Workflow

To put the new streamlined coordinate conversion feature into context we'll outline the steps below and explain how they differ from the previous workflow. For this example we'll use the British Coordinate System: OSGB36/BNG.

Previously DJI Terra users would process their data relative to the global coordinate system WGS 84 under these settings:





Horizontal Datum Settings: WGS 84

WGS 84 Geoid Settings: Default

DJI Terra did provide an option to convert data to a national coordinate system but this process lacked accuracy. Therefore conversion via an alternative software was needed to provide accurate localised georeferencing.

However after the firmware update users can now do this precise transformation within DJI Terra.

In the case of UK users the settings would be changed to the following:





Horizontal Datum Settings: OSGB 1936/British National Grid

OSGB 1936/British National Grid Geoid Settings: ODN Height

This is now possible because DJI Terra software incorporates the OSTN15 (National Grid Transformation) and the OSGM15 (National Geoid Model) parameters into the transformation enabling UK users to accurately georeference both horizontal and elevation data to the British coordinate system.

As test data shows the coordinate conversion through Terra is now as accurate as going through the Terra-Terrasolid workflow. The tables below show this accuracy comparison based on some test data collected by heliguy™. In this case the average magnitude is the figure we're after: Note how the average magnitude using the original Terra-Terrasolid workflow is 0.043 while the average magnitude using the new Terra workflow is 0.042.

The ability to convert data through Terra in this way is useful as most projects in the UK are georeferenced to the British National Grid coordinate system.

The fully georeferenced raw point cloud can then be directly exported from Terra. The data can also be put into a software platform like Terrasolid and the user can now bypass the coordinate conversion stage and go straight to point cloud cleaning and classification if required.

(WTVM) - All call for Aldi shoppers! The grocery store held a grand opening Thursday morning at its new location!

A line was formed - from the front doors of Aldi to the Dollar Store - as customers waited for the store to open.

The discount retailer occupies a space in the Midtown Shopping Center on Macon Road. The plaza has seen lots of redevelopment since Kmart closed in 2017 with the addition of AutoZone Roses and Panera Bread.

Aldi opened its first Columbus location on Veterans Parkway in 2015.

Columbus’ second Aldi location is at 3200 Macon Road.

Police released body camera footage Friday morning of a July 30 officer-involved shooting incident that led to the death of 31-year-old Kevin Hargraves-Shird.

Mayor Muriel Bowser also released the name of the officer who shot and killed Hargraves-Shird: Sergeant Reinaldo Otero-Camacho a 17-year veteran of MPD assigned to the 4th District.

He's currently on administrative leave while the U.S. Attorney's Office conducts an investigation.

Bowser and MPD Police Chief Robert Contee addressed the community about the incident during a Friday news conference.

""I want to start by saying that no matter the circumstances any loss of life is tragic. We know that Kevin was well loved and this is a traumatic loss for his family and friends"" Bowser said. ""We released this footage so that the community can see what we see but this remains an active investigation.""

Family members of Hargraves-Shird were also in the briefing room during that news conference visibly upset at times as they demanded answers about the officer's actions.

(Please be advised: The content in this video may be graphic for some.)

Both Bowser and Contee stressed that it's still very early on in the investigation and said the body camera footage released Friday doesn't answer all of their questions or the community's questions.

""What we can say for sure is that we don't know everything just looking at the video"" Bowser said. ""That is why the investigation proceeding accordingly is so important so we can get to the bottom of what happened.""

Per District law MPD must release body-worn camera footage within five days of an officer-involved shooting.

In addition to the U.S. Attorney's Office review Contee said MPD will conduct its own internal review as well.

""I'm sure there are questions about whether it was justified unjustified"" he said. ""We are nowhere near being able to make that determination at this point just based on the information we have so far.""

On July 30 at about 4 p.m. MPD said 4th District officers were called to the 900 block of Longfellow Street in Northwest after a reported shooting involving two dark-colored vehicles. Contee said after what appeared to be a shootout officers located a 17-year-old and 15-year-old shot and injured in an AutoZone parking lot at that location. He said several high-capacity loaded firearms were also found at that scene.

Contee said a witness contacted police notifying them that they spotted the shooter in a nearby alley discarding a gun.

""At 4:11 p.m. officers were speaking with this witness when they located a firearm under the vehicle and were alerted the individual was still in the alley"" Contee said. ""Officers spotted this person and a brief foot chase began until our members witnessed him jumping into a white sedan with several other people inside the vehicle. The vehicle sped off.""

Contee said police then issued a lookout for the vehicle and a sergeant spotted the car.



According to police Sergeant Reinaldo Otero-Camacho then turned on his emergency lights and sirens and began pursuing the vehicle.

Surveillance video from a home on Madison Street Northwest which MPD also released on Friday shows what happened next: the white sedan lost control striking a curb and crashing on Madison Street Northwest. The video then shows three people run from the car. Contee said police are still searching for those individuals.



Moments later video shows the driver of the car believed to be Hargraves-Shird get out of the vehicle as a police patrol car pulls up behind him.

Sergeant Reinaldo Otero-Camacho's body camera footage shows him pulling his gun out while the patrol car is still in motion then stop the car and quickly open the driver's side door.

On the body camera video you can hear the officer shout ""gun"" five times before shooting Hargraves-Shird.

He fired a single shot which hit Hargraves-Shird from about 35 yards away.

""We know from the video the officer says 'gun gun gun gun gun' five times. But why he said that we've have to find out from him"" Contee said. ""What I can tell you just through my training and experience a lot of times that is a command of warning warning to other officers in the area. Also in this video just off to the left there's a moon bounce there's some kids there there are people around. I don't know if the warning was for them the other officers hadn't pulled up on the scene.""

None of the video released Friday actually shows Hargraves-Shird holding a gun but MPD said a loaded pistol was found in the grass near where he was shot.

""We never want to see any of our community members involved in a gun exchange"" said Bowser. ""And that includes our police officers and those they are seeking to stop. What we know is that we have to fully investigate"" Bowser said.

Serena Hargaves who said Kevin Hargraves-Shird was her younger brother questioned Chief Contee at the news conference regarding the officer's ""gun"" command.

""Don't do that! Don't do that"" Serena Hargraves shouted at the mayor and police chief.

The Hargraves-Shird family also voiced frustration about MPD officer training and protocols and asked about the release of other body-worn camera footage of responding officers specifically those who rendered aid to Kevin.

Contee reassured the family that the department will do a DNA analysis on the firearm stating that he ""would hate to jump to conclusions."" The family also questioned the police department's statement that Hargraves-Shird was armed.

""There are other videos the family has that show there's no gun right there it's his phone"" Serena told reporters after the news conference. ""And I'm not satisfied with what they have to say.""

Immediately after Hargraves-Shird was shot the body camera footage also shows officers handcuff him before rendering aid.

7News asked Chief Contee why that happened and whether the responding officers followed proper protocol.

""After a person has been shot officers sometimes out of an abundance of caution will place a person in handcuffs and after placing them in handcuffs once the scene is safe no other issues or threats they'll remove the handcuffs and provide medical aid. It's not necessarily a hard and fast policy"" Contee said. ""It is our policy that we render aid but with respect to handcuffing it really depends on the officers' assessment of the scene and their control of the scene.""

Contee added that in this case three other individuals had just been seen running from the car and their whereabouts were unknown.

But he said all of that including the use of handcuffs would be part of the investigation moving forward.

Officials could not provide an estimated timeline on the length of the investigation into this deadly officer-involved shooting.

""They take as long as they take"" Bowser said.

Just hours after the body camera footage was released Serena Hargraves joined community members for a protest outside the Wilson Building.

She believes her brother should still be alive today and she wants the officer who shot him to be held accountable.



“He's the the only officer on the scene and he murdered my brother that's it!"" she said. ""That's it. Point blank period. And I need him to go -- I need him to be prosecuted to the fullest extent.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9ycy5jb20vZXRmcy1hbmQtZnVuZHMvc2VjdG9ycy9zcDUwMC1iaWctbmFtZS02MDAtYS1zaGFyZS1zdG9ja3MtcmVhbGx5LW91Z2h0LXRvLXNwbGl0LWFmdGVyLXRlc2xhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,11 Big $600-A-Share Stocks Really Ought To Split After Tesla,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/sp500-big-name-600-a-share-stocks-really-ought-to-split-after-tesla/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9ycy5jb20vZXRmcy1hbmQtZnVuZHMvc2VjdG9ycy9zcDUwMC1iaWctbmFtZS02MDAtYS1zaGFyZS1zdG9ja3MtcmVhbGx5LW91Z2h0LXRvLXNwbGl0LWFmdGVyLXRlc2xhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,
AVB,AvalonBay Communities,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA4LzA0L2hlcmVzLXdoeS1yaXNpbmctaG9tZS1wcmljZXMtaGVscC1hdmFsb24tYmF5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's Why Rising Home Prices Help Avalon Bay,"Avalon Bay is expanding into the right markets.

Apartment real estate investment trusts (REITs) had a rough go of it during the past couple of years as COVID-19 caused a surge in delinquencies and companies were often forced to make concessions to keep tenants in their apartments. Many states imposed no-eviction policies which caused an increase in non-collectible accounts. As the U.S. emerged from the pandemic real estate prices took off. These rising prices are providing the basis for rent increases which will help drive earnings.

Avalon Bay has exposure to some of the hottest real estate markets

Avalon Bay (AVB 1.15%) is an apartment REIT that operates in 12 states and had 81803 units as of the end of 2021. Avalon Bay is concentrated in urban areas primarily in the Northeast the Mid-Atlantic Southern and Northern California and the Pacific Northwest. It is also expanding into the Southeast Southwest and the Mountain states. Avalon Bay is developing new properties in its expansion markets and looking to reduce some of its footprint in established markets like the Northeast and California.

During the second quarter funds from operations (FFO) per share rose 22% which came in above company guidance. The increase was driven by a combination of high occupancy increased asking rents and improvement in bad debt expenses. The company said on the earnings conference call that asking rents are up 9% from the beginning of the year and are increasing about 15% year over year. FFO is how REITs generally state their earnings to investors. This is because depreciation and amortization (D&A) are big expenses that must be recognized under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). D&A is a non-cash charge which means the company doesn't actually reach into its pocket and write a check. FFO adds back these charges which give the investor a better picture of the cash flow generation of the company.

It will take another year to overcome the COVID issues

As a general rule rents and home prices tend to correlate. In many of Avalon Bay's markets single-family homes are expensive which keeps tenants in their apartments and makes increasing rents easier. Avalon Bay reported a strong 96.4% occupancy rate at the end of the quarter. That said Avalon Bay is still dealing with some of the regulatory fallout from COVID and said on the earnings conference call that it might take another year to get rents up to normal market levels in California.

Avalon is expanding into the best markets

Avalon Bay is expanding into some of the hottest real estate markets especially Raleigh-Durham North Carolina Dallas and a number of Florida cities. These cities are seeing annual home price appreciation of 30% and higher. Construction costs are rising but many of its costs have already been funded at lower interest rates so rising rents increase the return on investment. Note that rising construction costs also make the real estate market even tighter which is one reason housing construction remains subdued.

Dividend hike on the horizon?

Avalon Bay pays a quarterly dividend of $1.59 per share. Unlike many REITs Avalon Bay maintained its dividend during the COVID pandemic. The company has forecast full-year FFO per share to come in at $9.86 which means the $6.36 annual dividend is amply covered. Since REITs must distribute most of their earnings as dividends the company is ripe for a dividend hike. The stock currently yields about 3% and is trading at 21 times projected FFO per share. Avalon Bay is a way for investors to gain exposure to the red-hot housing market and also to some of the country's fastest-growing regions.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Operating in 50 countries with more than 35000 employees the company has said that the Rs 250 crore investment is part of the company’s overall strategy to reinforce its commitment to India’s growth and better serve its markets and customers.

A phased transition will take place for the facility and employees based out of the company’s Gurgaon plant over a period of time. However the corporate office of the company continues to be in Gurgaon. We had the opportunity in the last week of July to visit the plant and to see for ourselves what the company intended when it said that it was building a highly automated label stock line.

The state-of-the-art coating and lamination machine is managed by sophisticated automation for producing the finished jumbo reel of pressure-sensitive label stock and for evacuation to the high-speed slitters and sheeters in the finishing section of the enormous factory. Spread over an area of 12 acres the new state-of-the-art plant will produce technologically-advanced pressure-sensitive materials for the labeling and packaging industry and would incorporate best practices available across Avery Dennison globally.

In April Saurabh Agarwal senior director and general manager Label and Packaging Materials South Asia for Avery Dennison said “This move is the culmination of the customer’s increased demand as well as potential India holds as a region. I’m extremely pleased that this achievement has taken place in the same year Avery Dennison is celebrating 25 years of doing business in India.”

We took the opportunity for a brief conversation with Paramasivam K recently appointed as director of operations for the South Asia Region. A veteran of the global FMCG industry in the country with an engineering and management background Param as he is known is expected to bring best-in-class reliability and good practices to the plant. He said “We need to be responsive to our customers and the ultimate customers’ needs for reliable materials delivered well in time.”

It is also apt at this time to mention Avery Dennison’s reaction to the governments decision to implement the one month old ban on single-use plastic from 1 July 2022. Saurabh Agarwal senior director and general manager of LPM South Asia Avery Dennison said in early July itself “It is a welcome move since it supports the green initiative of curbing pollution and health hazards and leads to environmental sustainability. However in order to make this decision a success we would need to look at the replacement of plastic products with environmentally-friendly substitutes and more viable alternatives. Also we would need to significantly invest in research and development and look for more innovative technologies to develop alternative products in future.”

AXON,Axon Enterprise,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8wNC9leGVjcy1jdXJiLXNwZW5kaW5nLWNvbXBhbnktc3dhZy1yZWNlc3Npb24tZmVhcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Swag season is over: Execs are cracking down spending on perks,"As the office version of the Braveheart saying goes “They may take away our jobs but they’ll never take away our swag.”

Turns out that’s not necessarily true. As executives start to voice concerns about a looming recession they’ve begun cutting down on company gifts and expenses reports the Wall Street Journal’s Chip Cutter.

“Right now I smell opportunity. Yes winter’s coming. Now let’s embrace it” Rick Smith CEO of weapon and technology developer Axon Enterprise told the Journal of his hiring strategy.

Smith isn’t alone in his fears. More than 60% of executives believe a recession is imminent according to a June survey released by the Conference Board. Now they’re preparing for a cold season devoid of little company-branded trinkets and swag. Smith’s firm has even gone as far as hiring “swag czars” to approve or cut down spending.

It’s a far cry from earlier this year when companies battling to recruit talent during the Great Resignation turned to personalized swag bags to show that they cared. Those who got a job offer at appointment scheduling software company Calendly were given a bag of confetti along with assorted jars of candy stickers and even cocktail mix.

And while every 6-year-old will tell you that stickers can be fun logo-emblazoned swag isn’t always as appealing as other less surface-level benefits.

“Candidates really care about the intangibles like July Fourth and Christmas week off; those are more important than gifts” Mary Elizabeth Elkordy founder of PR firm Elkordy Global Strategies told Fortune.

But like a Trojan horse swag bags were gifts that came with strings attached. “Swag bags are anti-ghosting tactics and post-offer [new hires] may get a swag bag during onboarding” Peter Clare then-president of talent acquisition software company Jobvite told Fortune. “Same idea: to try and keep new employees as engaged as possible.”

Executives who are cutting back on swag because of recession fears can no longer employ coffee koozies to retain talent. But if a recession comes fears of losing employees might not be as pertinent when the labor market is tighter.

A detox might be called for while times are tight. As Smith tells the Journal “Not every event needs a T-shirt.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZGFpbHkuY29tL2RvamEtY2F0LWRhaWx5LXNjb29wL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Doja Cat is in swag bags are out,"It’s safe to say Doja Cat is not safe for work. An AdWeek article from May even described the star as “an average marketer’s worst nightmare.” But her candidness has made her the perfect partner for both Taco Bell and JBL a company focused on premium speakers headphones and home theater systems. Back in April the artist posted a TikTok video of herself holding up a sparkly crystal-encrusted speaker saying “Jibble! Jibble! Jibble!” It’s not how the brand pronounces its name but the video (and the fact that Doja Cat brought it to the red carpet with her) gave the company about two years’ worth of social engagement in just a few days.

Bill Wyman vice president of integrated marketing for JBL said that the video is perfect. “It’s her. And if we tried to stifle that it would really come across as someone shilling a product rather than her really liking this brand … [She] is merely connecting with her fans. Even the top comment “This is how you do an AD” received more than 171000 likes which shows that people just want to see people being well people. Having fun and being themselves. Here are today’s other top stories:

The salad days of swag bags are over

According to a June survey from The Conference Board more than 60% of executives believe a recession is imminent. As a result some companies are reducing or eliminating some of their perks in order to save money. Earlier this year Meta eliminated some of its lavish perks including free laundry and dry cleaning. Rick Smith CEO of weapon and technology developer Axon Enterprise told The Wall Street Journal that his firm has even gone as far as hiring “swag police” to reduce spending. “Right now I smell opportunity” he said. “Yes winter’s coming. Now let’s embrace it.”

For a while companies touted free snacks foosball tables and swag bags as “company culture.” But as Emily Stewart wrote in a Vox article about office snacks “If your employer loves you they should give you money not a granola bar.” What employees really want are flexible work options robust safety protocols in-person collaboration and intangibles like Christmas week off.

Why this matters: During The Great Resignation companies tried to sweeten their job offers with swag bags (and literal confetti). But because of recession fears companies’ budgets are going to be tighter — and employees may not want to leave their jobs either. Instead of spending money on T-shirts cocktail mixes and koozies employers should build a culture around what people really want: a clear break between their office and personal lives.

MEASURED THOUGHTS

A recent Pew Research Center survey found that about one-in-six U.S. journalists at news outlets are part of a union. The survey also found that many more would join one if they could. 41% of the nearly 12000 working U.S.-based journalists who were surveyed said they would join a union if it were available to them.

The desire to join a union is much higher among younger journalists than among older colleagues. 77% of full- or part-time journalists ages 18-29 are either already a member of a union or would join a union if it were an option. That’s nearly twice the number of journalists 65 and older (41%).

‘Stray’ cat video game helps real cats

“Stray” is a third-person cat adventure game set amidst the neon-lit alleys of a city overpopulated by robots. The game a fast hit with both gamers and their cats even inspired the creation of a Twitter account called @CatsWatchStray. The virtual orange tabby has been helping real cats though. Thanks to online fundraising platformers gamers are able to play “Stray” for live audiences while raising money for animal shelters and other cat-related charities. Annapurna Interactive the game’s publisher even reached out to the Nebraska Humane Society to partner before the game’s July 19 launch. Marketing specialist Brendan Gepson said they jumped at the chance.

“The whole game and the whole culture around the game it’s all about a love of cats. It meshed really well with the shelter and our mission and was really mutually beneficial. They got some really good PR out of it and we got a whole new donor base out of it.”

Annapurna Interactive provided the Nebraska Humane Society with four copies of the game to give away. In one week the organization raised $7000 from 550 donors most of whom were new.

Why this matters: Consumers are getting better at identifying which companies are trying to improve their image and which ones actually care about the causes they are supporting. All businesses regardless of size can benefit from targeted charity marketing. Charitable campaigns not only help a community or cause but also get people to talk about you in a positive light.

A remotely controllable manipulating unit allows the user to position the sample within the beam. The final X-ray image is displayed on a monitor for computerized image processing. In addition the X-ray system may be outfitted with an electronic program control allowing automated sample inspection. The X-ray image shows object features based on differences in material density.

Part of the X-ray spectrum is absorbed when passing through an object. The thicker or higher in density the object the more X-rays are absorbed and do not pass through. Those X-rays that pass through the object strike a detector where an X-ray image is created. This image is made up of different shades of gray depending upon the intensity of the incident rays: Parts of the object that are thicker or materials that are higher in density such as iron copper and lead appear darker than less dense materials such as plastics paper or even air.

This film is then processed in a darkroom - much like typical photographic film - and the various degrees of radiation captured by the film are represented as different values of white and black. X-rays not absorbed by the target sample will cause exposure of the radiographic detector. These areas will appear dark. Areas that absorbed higher levels due to higher absorbing or more dense material will appear light.

In this way regions of your target sample where uniform density has been changed by imperfections such as porosity cracks or misalignment will appear as dark lines thus making it easier for a skilled technician to detect.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2VuZXJneS91cy1vaWwtcmlnLWNvdW50LWZhbGxzLWJ5LW1vc3Qtc2luY2Utc2VwdGVtYmVyLWJha2VyLWh1Z2hlcy0yMDIyLTA4LTA1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. oil rig count falls by the most since September Baker Hughes says,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-oil-rig-count-falls-by-most-since-september-baker-hughes-2022-08-05/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2VuZXJneS91cy1vaWwtcmlnLWNvdW50LWZhbGxzLWJ5LW1vc3Qtc2luY2Utc2VwdGVtYmVyLWJha2VyLWh1Z2hlcy0yMDIyLTA4LTA1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJha2VyaHVnaGVzLmNvbS93YXlnYXRlLXRlY2hub2xvZ2llcy9jYXNlLXN0dWR5L3doYXRzLWluc2lkZS1teS11c2ItZHJpdmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What’s inside my USB drive?,"Evaluation of non-destructive testing methods for nano packaging technologies

New packages and new packaging technologies need corresponding high-resolution non-destructive testing methods. But which testing methods are able to image nano packaging defects? It is necessary to develop evaluation techniques to find out the possibilities and limitations of different inspection technologies. Some ways are the use of so-called reference objects and defect samples. A third way to evaluate non-destructive testing methods is the use of electronic systems with a limited volume and complexity like a USB memory device.

Evaluation of a USB memory device – state of the art in 2008 – by X-ray techniques

An interesting example to evaluate NDT methods was a micro USB memory device with 2 GB memory size. These investigations have been done at Dresden University of Technology Germany. The electronic part inside of this memory device was designed as System-in-Package (SiP) housed in a metal cage with polymer cover. To evaluate the inside structure X-ray radiography and X-ray CT have been used (180 kV Phoenix Nanome|x and Nanotom systems). X-ray radiography results showed the inside components but even in oblique view inspection only poor information about the 3rd dimension.

The PCB some passive components (capacitors and resistors) the bonding wires of the controller die and the memories (material Au) the crystal oscillator and the activities LED were visible. More information about the inside structure and the location of the components showed the CT results revealing the bonding area of four stacked memory dies. This was state of the art in packaging technology for relatively inexpensive goods - the price of this USB memory device was approx. 23 US$ in 2008.

Evaluation of a USB memory device – state of the art in 2012 – by X-ray techniques

During a discussion between colleagues of Dresden University of Technology and Waygate Technologies an idea was born to compare the investigation results from 2008 with USB memory devices from 2012. The questions were:

What technologies have been used to produce current memory devices?

Are the statements of technology roadmaps valid for this market?

What details are visible with newest X-ray inspection technologies?

To do this evaluation a 32 GB USB memory device was chosen and different CT scans with different resolutions have been performed at Waygate Technologies' facility in Wunstorf (Germany). The visualizations of the CT results have been done by Volume Graphics in Heidelberg (Germany).

Detail views and virtual cross-sections led to more information about the construction of the device and of the used technologies. The PCB a small number of passives the controller die and two stacked memory dies are visible in the CT images. The analysis of the CT results showed that the packaging technologies are nearly the same since 2008. The progress in development is affected by the semiconductor industry – in this case by the memory producer. But one detail was very surprising:

The highlight – wire bonds on die’s bonding pads

During the analysis of the CT results especially of the 2D virtual cross-sections structures on the controller die’s surface have been found. A more detailed evaluation of the pictures showed metallization layers and the wire bonding connections on the die these were later identified by EDX analysis as tungsten traces with an aluminum coating.

These surprising results show the fast development of X-ray detectors in the last years. The CT recording has been done with Phoenix’s 14-bit grayscale temperature stabilized DXR X-ray detector with CsI-scintillator. After finding these results an additional CT scan with a 12-bit X-ray detector with Gd2O3-scintillator on the same USB memory device has been performed for comparison reasons. This CT showed structures on die’s surface only poorly – nearly the noise in the pictures.

Conclusions

The non-destructive X-ray techniques (especially CT) are very important and essential for the evaluation and characterization of miniaturized electronic packages. To get excellent results with these methods a good material contrast of the sample and a high resolution of the X-ray system are necessary. The use of samples with known inside structures is a useful way to evaluate non-destructive testing methods.

The inspection of different USB memory devices at different technological ages shows the dominance of the semiconductor development. Electronics packaging evolution runs more in waves – as semiconductors it demands.

A further result of these investigations is the evaluation of latest 14-bit temperature stabilized X-ray detectors. These detectors are able to deliver X-ray pictures with a very high contrast and low noise. Very thin structures on silicon dies are detectable.

The company said it expects to end operations in St. Paul by next spring affecting about 110 workers.

Another Ball plant is closing in Phoenix Ariz. and the construction of a new facility in Nevada is being delayed. The company said in a news release that the moves come amid ""deceleration of customer demand resulting from significant retail pricing actions by customers to pass through inflationary costs to consumers particularly in the U.S.""

St. Paul’s aluminum can production will be moved to other plants owned by Colorado-based Ball which employs more than 24000 people worldwide.

The exact date of the St. Paul plant closure will be subject to customer needs. Ball said it will be negotiating with the plant's union to discuss the effects of the closure on employees.

Ball acquired the St. Paul plant — formerly owned by Rexam — in 2016. The large blue factory is located near the corner of Robert Street and Plato Boulevard. The company said the future of the property will be determined at a later date.

In 2018 the St. Paul Port Authority tweeted that the Ball plant produced 5.5 million cans a day — which adds up to about 2 billion cans a year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2JhbGwtYW5ub3VuY2VzLXNlY29uZC1xdWFydGVyLTIwMjItcmVzdWx0cy1hbmQtcmVwaGFzaW5nLW9mLWNlcnRhaW4tZ3Jvd3RoLWNhcGl0YWwtcHJvamVjdHMtMzAxNTk5NjY1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ball Announces Second Quarter 2022 Results and Rephasing of Certain Growth Capital Projects,"Highlights

Biennial investor day management briefing scheduled for September 22

WESTMINSTER Colo. Aug. 4 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Ball Corporation (NYSE: BALL) today reported on a U.S. GAAP basis a second quarter 2022 net loss attributable to the corporation of $174 million (including a net after-tax loss of $437 million or $1.37 per diluted share for business consolidation and other non-comparable items including the non-cash long-lived asset impairment for the Russian beverage packaging operations) or a loss of 55 cents per diluted share on sales of $4.13 billion compared to $202 million net earnings attributable to the corporation or 61 cents per diluted share (including net after-tax charges of $85 million or 25 cents per diluted share for business consolidation and other non-comparable items) on sales of $3.46 billion in 2021. Results for the first six months of 2022 were net earnings attributable to the corporation of $272 million or 84 cents per diluted share on sales of $7.85 billion compared to $402 million or $1.20 per diluted share on sales of $6.58 billion for the first six months of 2021.

Ball's second quarter and year-to-date 2022 comparable earnings per diluted share were 82 cents and $1.59 respectively versus second quarter and year-to-date 2021 comparable earnings per diluted share of 86 cents and $1.58 respectively.

""We delivered stable year-over-year comparable operating earnings amid notable cost inflation demand volatility and euro earnings translation headwinds. Global growth for sustainable aluminum beverage and personal care products packaging continues and in certain regions varied from original expectations. To balance the near-term effects of economic volatility on consumer demand with long-term growth opportunities for our aluminum packaging portfolio and aerospace technologies the global team has initiated actions to rephase capital projects and further manage costs to maximize EVA cash and returns. Through our capital discipline financial strength ownership mindset manufacturing footprint and innovative product portfolio we can successfully navigate the current economic environment and create value for our stakeholders"" said Daniel W. Fisher president and CEO.

Beverage Packaging North and Central America

Beverage packaging North and Central America segment comparable operating earnings for the second quarter 2022 were $164 million on sales of $1.78 billion compared to $193 million on sales of $1.52 billion during the same period in 2021. For the first six months segment comparable operating earnings were $338 million on sales of $3.38 billion compared to $333 million on sales of $2.82 billion during the same period in 2021. Year-over-year sales reflect the contractual pass through of higher aluminum costs and price/mix.

Second quarter segment comparable operating earnings were down year-over-year and include the impact of higher manufacturing and inflationary costs. Segment volumes were flat in the second quarter and reflect the deceleration of customer demand resulting from significant retail pricing actions by customers to pass through inflationary costs to consumers particularly in the U.S.

In response to the deceleration in customer demand late in the second quarter the construction of a new beverage can manufacturing facility in North Las Vegas Nevada has been delayed and certain actions across the existing North American manufacturing footprint including ceasing production at our Phoenix Arizona and St. Paul Minnesota facilities have been announced to address localized supply/demand imbalances.

Beverage Packaging EMEA

Beverage packaging EMEA segment comparable operating earnings for second quarter 2022 were $129 million on sales of $1.13 billion compared to $124 million on sales of $906 million during the same period in 2021. For the first six months segment comparable operating earnings were $229 million on sales of $2.08 billion compared to $224 million on sales of $1.70 billion during the same period in 2021. Year-over-year sales reflect higher shipments and the contractual pass through of higher aluminum costs offset by unfavorable foreign exchange translation.

Second quarter segment comparable operating earnings improved versus the same period in 2021 and reflect 7.7 percent segment volume growth and favorable specialty mix offset by $9 million of unfavorable currency translation and the impact of supply chain tightness and inflation across the region. Packaging mix shift to aluminum cans continues and specialty can mix remained above 60 percent during the quarter. Given strong regional demand the construction of new beverage can manufacturing facilities in the U.K. and Czech Republic remain on track and will enable further growth for sustainable aluminum beverage packaging across the region. Projects are supported by long-term contracts with improved contractual terms and conditions. In advance of new production coming online in EMEA imports from the company's joint venture beverage can manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia supplemented existing production capabilities across Europe during the quarter.

As a result of the war in Ukraine the company previously announced its intention to suspend future investments in Russia and pursue a sale of its Russian business. As of June 30 2022 the Russian business does not meet the accounting criteria to be presented as held for sale in the consolidated financial statements. See Note 1 ""Business Segment Information"" for additional information on the non-cash long-lived asset impairment for the Russian operations recorded in business consolidation and other activities during second quarter of 2022. The company continues to support humanitarian efforts in Ukraine and surrounding European countries as well as manage costs across the segment in advance of the impending Russian business sale. Going forward the business continues to monitor ongoing inflation and consumer behaviors and will remain agile and disciplined relative to deploying growth capital.

Beverage Packaging South America

Beverage packaging South America segment comparable operating earnings for second quarter 2022 were $52 million on sales of $534 million compared to $78 million on sales of $452 million in 2021. For the first six months comparable segment operating earnings were $130 million on sales of $1.03 billion compared to $171 million on sales of $939 million during the same period in 2021. Year-over-year sales reflect the contractual pass through of higher aluminum costs and price/mix partially offset by lower shipments.

Second quarter segment comparable operating earnings decreased 33 percent due to a 2.9 percent decline in segment volumes versus 15.4 percent volume growth in the second quarter of 2021 and unfavorable regional customer/product mix in Brazil.

Demand trends in the company's South American operations outside of Brazil remain favorable. During the quarter the company announced construction of a new beverage can manufacturing plant in Peru. The segment's performance is expected to improve in the second half of 2022 due to higher single-serve beverage consumption during the World Cup and a seasonally strong fourth quarter.

Aerospace

Aerospace segment comparable operating earnings for second quarter 2022 were $36 million on sales of $490 million compared to $34 million on sales of $459 million in 2021. Second quarter backlog reached $3.0 billion and contracts won but not yet booked into backlog ended the quarter at $4.7 billion. For the first six months segment comparable operating earnings were $79 million on sales of $994 million compared to $69 million on sales of $883 million during the same period in 2021.

Second quarter segment comparable operating earnings reflect year-over-year sales growth offset by supply chain inefficiencies and rate adjustments. The segment continues to leverage its talent pool and manufacturing capacity test capabilities engineering and support workspace to secure additional defense climate change and Earth-monitoring contracts to provide mission-critical programs and technologies to U.S. government defense intelligence and reconnaissance and surveillance customers.

Following decades of collaboration the company joined NASA and industry partners to celebrate the successful initial images from the James Webb Space Telescope. Ball Aerospace designed and built the advanced optical technology and lightweight mirror system that made these unprecedented images possible. Also during the quarter the team successfully completed a critical design review of the NOAA Space Weather Follow On-Lagrange 1 Spacecraft (SWFO-L1). Ball will now proceed with the production integration and test of the space weather monitoring satellite. Expected to launch in 2025 SWFO-L1 will collect solar wind data and coronal imagery to meet NOAA's operational requirements to monitor and forecast impacts from solar storm activity.

Non-reportable

In addition to undistributed corporate expenses the results for the company's global aluminum aerosol business beverage can manufacturing facilities in India Saudi Arabia and Myanmar and investments in the company's aluminum cup business continue to be reported in other non-reportable.

Second quarter 2022 results reflect lower year-over-year undistributed corporate expenses higher aluminum cup demand in the retail and food service channels 11.3 percent volume growth for extruded aluminum aerosol containers and 51.7 percent volume growth in the other non-reportable beverage can manufacturing facilities where certain production is being exported to support EMEA segment demand prior to new capital projects coming online in 2022. During the quarter the company's global aluminum aerosol customers continued to pursue next generation lightweight sustainable personal care packaging solutions including the company's Infinity aluminum bottle and refillable aluminum bottles for new categories.

Outlook

""Business execution being good stewards of our cash and controlling the things we can control in today's global economic and geopolitical environments is key. Our company's resiliency financial strength recession resistant business portfolio and low cost of capital continue to provide stability optionality and opportunities for long-term growth. We remain well-positioned for medium-term and long-term growth and returning significant value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends"" said Scott C. Morrison executive vice president and chief financial officer.

""We will continue to actively manage our businesses through the lens of EVA and sustainability. Over our 142-year history we have remained agile and successfully weathered numerous periods of economic volatility and its associated effects. Through our ability to offset inflationary costs over time achieve higher returns on invested capital leverage sustainability and enable supply chain partnerships to support continued mix shift to aluminum packaging as well as to serve growing demand for our critical aerospace technologies and environmental intelligence we look forward to achieving our long-term diluted earnings per share growth goal over time and returning even more value to shareholders"" Fisher said.

Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements (Second Quarter 2022)

1. Business Segment Information

Ball's operations are organized and reviewed by management along its product lines and geographical areas and presented in the four reportable segments outlined below.

Beverage packaging North and Central America : Consists of operations in the U.S. Canada and Mexico that manufacture and sell aluminum beverage containers throughout those countries.

Beverage packaging EMEA : Consists of operations in numerous countries throughout Europe including Russia as well as Egypt and Turkey that manufacture and sell aluminum beverage containers throughout those countries.

The current global business environment is being impacted directly and indirectly by the effects of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Ball has suspended future investments in Russia and is pursuing the sale of its aluminum beverage packaging business located in Russia. During the second quarter of 2022 Ball experienced deteriorating conditions and determined this constituted a triggering event for its Russian long-lived asset group. As a result Ball performed an expected cash flow recoverability analysis to estimate the fair value of the long-lived assets and recorded an impairment loss of $435 million.

As of June 30 2022 Ball's Russian aluminum packaging business does not meet the requirements for held for sale presentation in Ball's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The ongoing conflict continues to have the potential to increase Ball's vulnerabilities to near-term severe impacts related to its Russian business and facilities and it is not possible to accurately predict all future impacts of the invasion. The Russian government has made warnings to companies that cease operations during its invasion of Ukraine and the potential exists that Ball's operations in Russia could be negatively impacted. As such Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the resulting effects have the potential to impact significant estimates used by Ball in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements which could result in additional impairments.

Ball's Russian business which is presented in its beverage packaging EMEA reportable operating segment represented approximately 4 percent of the company's total net sales and 8 percent of the company's total comparable operating earnings for the twelve months ended December 31 2021. In addition our plants in Russia accounted for approximately 5 percent of the company's 112.5 billion global beverage can unit shipments for the twelve months ended December 31 2021. As of June 30 2022 after the $435 million long-lived asset impairment charge Ball's Russian business had net assets of $380 million which consisted primarily of working capital and goodwill that will be allocated to the disposal group upon a future disposal. As of June 30 2022 in addition to the $380 million of net assets Ball also had cumulative currency translation gains of $180 million presented in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss) on Ball's unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets that will be subject to release upon a disposal of the Russian business. These values are subject to change based on the Russian ruble exchange rate.

Beverage packaging South America : Consists of operations in Brazil Argentina Paraguay and Chile that manufacture and sell aluminum beverage containers throughout most of South America.

Aerospace : Consists of operations that manufacture and sell aerospace and other related products and provide services used in the defense civil space and commercial space industries.

Other consists of a non-reportable operating segment (beverage packaging other) that manufactures and sells aluminum beverage containers; a non-reportable operating segment that manufactures and sells extruded aluminum aerosol containers and recloseable aluminum bottles across multiple consumer categories as well as slugs (aerosol packaging); a non-reportable operating segment that manufactures and sells aluminum cups (aluminum cups); undistributed corporate expenses; and intercompany eliminations and other business activities.

The company also has investments in operations in Guatemala Panama the U.S. and Vietnam that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and accordingly those results are not included in segment sales or earnings.

During the first quarter of 2022 Ball sold its remaining 49 percent owned equity method investment in Ball Metalpack to Sonoco a global provider of consumer industrial healthcare and protective packaging for total consideration of approximately $298 million which is presented in business consolidation and other activities in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of earnings.

2. Non-U.S. GAAP Measures

Non-U.S. GAAP Measures – Non-U.S. GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation. They should not be considered superior to or a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Presentations of earnings and cash flows presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP are available in the company's earnings releases and quarterly and annual regulatory filings. Information reconciling forward-looking U.S. GAAP measures to non-U.S. GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort. We have not provided guidance for the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures as they are not available without unreasonable effort due to the high variability complexity and low visibility with respect to certain special items including restructuring charges business consolidation and other costs gains and losses related to acquisition and divestiture of businesses the ultimate outcome of certain legal or tax proceedings and other non-comparable items. These items are uncertain depend on various factors and could be material to our results computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Comparable Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (Comparable EBITDA) Comparable Operating Earnings Comparable Net Earnings Comparable Diluted Earnings Per Share and Net Debt – Comparable EBITDA is earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization business consolidation and other non-comparable costs. Comparable Operating Earnings is earnings before interest taxes business consolidation and other non-comparable costs. Comparable Net Earnings is net earnings attributable to Ball Corporation before business consolidation and other non-comparable costs after tax. Comparable Diluted Earnings Per Share is Comparable Net Earnings divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding. We use Comparable EBITDA Comparable Operating Earnings Comparable Net Earnings and Comparable Diluted Earnings Per Share internally to evaluate the company's operating performance. Net Debt is total debt less cash and cash equivalents which are derived directly from the company's financial statements. Ball management uses Net Debt to Comparable EBITDA and Comparable EBITDA to interest expense as metrics to monitor the credit quality of Ball Corporation.

Please see the company's website for further details of the company's non-U.S. GAAP financial measures at www.ball.com/investors under the ""FINANCIALS"" tab.

Had these securities been included approximately 320.8 million weighted average shares would have been used in calculating diluted earnings (loss) per share for the three ended June 30 2022. Comparable net earnings for the three months ended June 30 2022 was positive; therefore approximately 320.8 million weighted average shares were used to calculate comparable diluted earnings per share.

(1) Ball recorded a non-cash impairment for its Russian long-lived asset group. During the second quarter of 2022 Ball experienced deteriorating conditions due to the escalating conflict and associated effects from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. As a result after taking into account the progress of our ongoing sales process currency exchange movements supply challenges and effects of the escalating conflict the company has concluded the long-lived assets are impaired.

(2) In July 2022 Ball's beverage packaging South America segment formally notified a regional customer in Brazil of its breach of a long-term committed supply agreement since the first quarter of 2022 inclusive of beverage can and end volume requirements and associated accounts payable with Ball. In the event that satisfactory rectifying action is not taken in response to the notification of breach Ball intends to pursue legal action to recover all amounts due and seek damages for non-performance. Ball recorded a charge reflecting an increased risk of not being able to fully collect amounts due from the customer. After recording this charge Ball has financial exposure on balances due from the customer of $37 million which are presented in receivables net other current assets and other assets in its unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. Ball considers that losses in the event of an unfavorable outcome to the dispute and any related legal action (or gains in the event of a favorable outcome) would not have a material effect upon its liquidity results of operations or financial condition.

(3) Ball sold its remaining 49 percent owned equity method investment in Ball Metalpack and recorded a gain. In the second quarter of 2022 Ball recorded charges associated with the reduction of sales price due to customary closing adjustments related to the sale.

(4) The company donated funds to The Ball Foundation a non-profit philanthropic organization with efforts to build a better world. The Ball Foundation awards grants to nonprofit organizations primarily in communities where the company operates focusing on priorities related to education recycling and disaster relief and preparedness.

(5) Ball recorded a gain from Ball Metalpack's repayment of a loan which was formerly fully reserved.

(6) Ball recorded net impacts associated with its inability to hedge Russian ruble currency exposures.

(7) Ball recorded a benefit for a reduction in the deferred tax liability on the investment in its Russian business which was partially offset by a charge to settle a tax dispute in Uruguay.

What happened

Shares of aluminum company Ball Corporation (BALL -0.40%) plunged on Thursday after profitability for the second quarter of 2022 fell short of expectations. As of 3:15 p.m. ET Ball stock was down 18%.

So what

Let's start with net sales. In Q2 Ball generated net sales of $4.1 billion up almost 20% year over year. This was significantly ahead of analysts' expectations with strong demand for beverage cans (for most of the quarter) and solid performance in its aerospace division.

Revenue was up but Ball's earnings took a big hit and it's one of the reasons the stock was down today. The company had a net loss of $165 million compared to net income of $202 million in the same quarter last year. However this is primarily due to divesting its assets in Russia because of its war with Ukraine resulting in a one-time noncash impairment charge.

That said Wall Street still wasn't impressed with Ball's Q2 performance. Truist analyst Michael Roxland downgraded Ball stock from a buy to a hold according to The Fly.

Now what

One thing that particularly troubled Roxland was weakness in Ball's North America beverage segment. And indeed Ball did say that demand slowed down significantly late in the quarter. Consequently the company is delaying the opening of its new manufacturing facility in North Las Vegas.

Business has slowed for Ball and caused investors to sell the stock. But this might be an opportunity for some. Right now Ball has a market capitalization of $19 billion but is on track to return $1 billion to shareholders this year via dividends and share repurchases. That could provide a significant earnings-per-share boost in coming years making now a better-than-average time to get in on this historically stable business.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZXZuZXQuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMi9iYWxsLXRvLWNsb3NlLWNhbi1tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nLXBsYW50cy1pbi1waG9lbml4LXN0LXBhdWwtZGVsYXlzLWNvbnN0cnVjdGlvbi1pbi1ub3J0aC1sYXMtdmVnYXMtcXVlc3Rpb25zLWN1c3RvbWVyLXByaWNpbmctc3RyYXRlZ2llcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ball to Close Can Manufacturing Plants in Phoenix St. Paul; Delays Construction in North Las Vegas; Questions ...,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZXZuZXQuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMi9iYWxsLXRvLWNsb3NlLWNhbi1tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nLXBsYW50cy1pbi1waG9lbml4LXN0LXBhdWwtZGVsYXlzLWNvbnN0cnVjdGlvbi1pbi1ub3J0aC1sYXMtdmVnYXMtcXVlc3Rpb25zLWN1c3RvbWVyLXByaWNpbmctc3RyYXRlZ2llcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D84942230>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZXZuZXQuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMi9iYWxsLXRvLWNsb3NlLWNhbi1tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nLXBsYW50cy1pbi1waG9lbml4LXN0LXBhdWwtZGVsYXlzLWNvbnN0cnVjdGlvbi1pbi1ub3J0aC1sYXMtdmVnYXMtcXVlc3Rpb25zLWN1c3RvbWVyLXByaWNpbmctc3RyYXRlZ2llcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9iYWxsLWNvcnAtd2lsbC1zaHV0LXN0LXBhdWwtY2FuLWZhY3RvcnkvNjAwMTk2MDIyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ball Corp. will shut St. Paul can factory,"Ball Corp. is shutting its St. Paul beverage can factory sometime in spring 2023.

The closure announcement Thursday follows a second-quarter loss tied to inflation slowing customer demand and the ceasing of investments in its Russian operations due to the war in Ukraine.

The company expects about 110 workers in St. Paul to be affected by the closure.

Under its prior owner the plant was hailed for producing 2.1 billion aluminum cans a year for Coke Pepsi Dr Pepper breweries and other customers across the United States.

Now the St. Paul operation is expected to be consolidated into to other Ball locations.

The 142-year-old Colorado-based Ball which bought the former Rexam can factory near Robert Street and Plato Boulevard in 2016 also will shut its factory in Phoenix and delay construction of a new beverage can plant in North Las Vegas.

Ball has 24300 employees across the Americas and Europe. It is not yet known how many jobs will be lost as it consolidates.

On Thursday Ball posted a $174 million loss for the second quarter on sales of $4.13 billion. It reported $13.8 billion in sales for 2021.

During a conference call with analysts Thursday CEO Daniel Fisher cited headwinds such as ""notable cost inflation demand volatility and euro earnings translations."" After taking cost and production actions though ""we can successfully navigate the current economic environment and create value for our stakeholders.""

Ball's stock took a 5% hit on Friday to close at $56.35 after plunging 18% Thursday.

Deutsche Bank analyst Kyle White lowered his price target for the company Friday from $81 to $56 according to Reuters.

""While we believe the multiyear growth story for beverage cans still exists on a global basis we see better ways to capture this opportunity on a relative basis and choose to be more selective"" he said in a research note warning the company has lost its forward momentum."
BAC,Bank of America,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVmaW5hbmNpYWxjYXJlZXJzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDgvYmFuay1vZi1hbWVyaWNhLWFuYWx5c3QtcGF50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Bank of America became the best paying bank for juniors,"As analysts in investment banks are informed of their bonuses this summer there is more than a small degree of disgruntlement. Revenues in M&A divisions held up better in the first half of this year than revenues in capital markets but juniors in all areas of investment banking appear to have been bonuses slashed. It's not just that they're earning less than last year when pay was at record highs. In many cases they're also earning less than 2019.

""It's an insult they are joking"" one first year Morgan Stanley analyst told us last week upon discovering that his bonus in London was a mere 30% of his bonus. Second years at the bank reportedly received 50%. Neither were well-received after a year of 80 hour weeks.

JPMorgan's analyst bonuses also appear to have been low and have evoked a similar tide of complaints but grumbling is far less prevalent at Bank of America. While other banks have cut analyst bonuses by more than last year's salary increases Bank of America has been generous. Investment banking fees at Bank of America were down 33% year-on-year in the first half of 2022. But for the most part its people seem to be happy.

Bank of America didn't respond to a request to comment on its pay. First year analyst salaries at Bank of America in London are £65k. Second year analyst salaries are £80k. First years have seemingly been receiving bonuses varying from 34% to 71% of salary with some high performers allegedly receiving bonuses equivalent to salary. Juniors at rivals are looking on and they are envious.

BofA's generosity may yet be trounced by Goldman Sachs which informs analysts of their bonuses in mid-August. Last year Goldman Sachs paid first years the most with total compensation in London averaging £130k according to Dartmouth Partners but Bank of America was in second place with £113k compared to £101k at JPMorgan and £103k at Morgan Stanley.

SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- Looking for a little extra cash? You may have it stuffed in a sock somewhere and not even know it. That's what one San Francisco woman found out. Yet even after discovering the money she couldn't get her hands on it.

Patsy Turner has been a longtime Bank of America customer.

Some two decades ago she received a call from the bank that her branch would be closing. They told her she would have to retrieve her possessions out of her safe deposit box.

""I told him I don't have the key anymore. I lost it. They said 'Well we're going to open it and you're going to have to pay us.' They opened it. I paid them and that's the last I heard"" Turner recalled.

Fast forward some 20 years later. Turner received another call from B of A... This time telling her to come to the bank on Leland Avenue in San Francisco.

""I went to the bank. There was this safe deposit box and they said 'Here take the contents'"" said Turner.

She had not opened that safe deposit box for ages. Among the items she found: a cashier's check worth $900.

It was originally made out to her in March 1988 -- more than 34 years ago.

She went back to the bank to try to cash it.

The bank refused saying the check was too old.

""I said 'You know what you guys. This is a good cashiers check. It doesn't say void any place anywhere. You guys need to give me my money'"" Turner said.

RELATED: Lawsuit claims Bank of America failed to warn customers they might get scammed using Zelle

A class-action lawsuit claims Bank of America has failed to warn customers about the risks of sending money through Zelle.

Instead the bank sent her to Unclaimed Property at the State Controller's Office.

The agency has a vault filled with unclaimed items including gold coins rare baseball cards and even savings bonds.

The items turned over to the state are worth billions.

Unfortunately the controller's office had no record of any money belonging to Turner. It said financial institutions are required to report a cashier's check if still uncashed after three years.

Turner went back to Bank of America.

""Everybody kept telling me 'No no no' and I kept insisting that this was a good -- this was like money"" Turner said.

That's when Turner turned to 7 On Your Side. We reached out to Bank of America.

The bank told us: ""This cashier's check dates back 34 years which goes well beyond record retention requirements. We value our customer relationships.""

It agreed to cash the check for Turner.

She used the money to take a cruise to Ensenada.

""You pulled it out and took care of it. I appreciate it because $900 is a lot of money to lose"" she said.

You can check with the Unclaimed Property website to find out if you have any money waiting to be claimed.

I recently sat down with him to discuss the Fed the economy the capital markets whether we are facing another financial crisis and why he thinks over-reliance on the Fed is bad for our economy and our democracy.

This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

Thanks very much for joining me. Can you summarize the thesis of your book “The Fed Unbound: Central Banking in a Time of Crisis”?

The Federal Reserve is an organization created by Congress for a limited very important purpose to do a difficult job which is to manage the U.S. money supply.

When you log on to a Bank of America or Citigroup account and you see a balance there that’s the money that the Fed is managing. Those are not the same thing as green pieces of paper. And the Fed’s job is to ensure that you treat them the same that you think of them the same. And that the amount of those Bank of America bucks is growing at a rate that is appropriate for the economy to put all of its resources to work including all of its people.

The thesis of the book is that monetary liberalization deregulation of the banking system and a lot of choices made during the second half of the 20th century caused the Fed to become “unbound.” Basically what you have is the rise of a “shadow banking” system. All these financial companies that aren’t under the Fed’s purview they start creating money. The Fed doesn’t have the tools to manage them and then they run into problems during economic downturns and the Fed pulls out all the stops and tries to backstop them — bail them out.

That’s the 2008 financial crisis. And that fundamental dynamic is still with us.

Fair enough.

It’s a dynamic that will eventually lead to either the failure of our democracy or the failure of our economy. —Lev Menand

Following the Great Depression the Fed was very successful. We didn’t have intermittent banking panics. Every time there was a recession people didn’t run on banks. We thought that we had solved monetary instability and financial crises until 2008. And what was 2008? It was a run on shadow banks. A whole group of financial institutions had come along and started to do what banks do. They started to create deposits of their own called different things. And they were exposed to the same run dynamics that you saw in the 19th century before the Fed was created. And the Fed decided if we don’t come in and backstop this system it will collapse. But it was never expected that this would be how the Fed [acted]. The Fed was not designed to stabilize the shadow banking system.

Let’s just back up. You’ve given a preliminary definition of shadow banking but walk us through it. These are not bank deposits that are backstopped by the federal government by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Give us a really simple example. A money market fund is part of the shadow banking system right? So it’s not like it’s an obscure financial system for the elite. Most middle-class Americans touch the shadow banking system.

Yeah. So there are three major types of shadow banking that I talk about in the book. You mentioned one that’s the one that ordinary Americans are most likely to have encountered. The other types are primarily wholesalers for businesses not ordinary individuals but basically what they all have in common is they are non-bank firms that do not have a bank charter that are trying to reproduce the bank business model. The Fed doesn’t have the same set of tools to ensure that the money market fund [and other shadow bank institutions aren’t] taking too many risks.

The shadow banking system is huge right?

In 2007 which was the peak of the shadow banking system a peak we will eventually return to if further reforms are not made it’s estimated that there were about $15 trillion of shadow bank-issued money instruments against $7 or $8 trillion of bank deposits and less than $1 trillion of government-issued cash.

In the aftermath the shadow banking system got a lot smaller because we had a lot of major shadow banks fail like Lehman Brothers. And then over the last 10 to 15 years it has grown again.

So now we’re back where the banking system is much bigger. There’s $18 trillion of deposits. And the shadow banking system is probably around the same size maybe slightly smaller. It’s very hard to estimate the size well because it’s in the shadows.

You say that this is in the shadows which is another way of saying it’s not fully regulated. So we had a financial crisis in 2008. You write that they essentially have two failures coming out of this. One is to not recognize the true nature of the crisis. They think of it as a 100-year flood rather than a fundamental aspect of structural fragility. And then the second thing is that we pass a sweeping financial reform the Dodd-Frank act that touches every corner of the financial system and yet is I think your view would be woefully inadequate. What does the Fed do right? What does the Fed do wrong?

So a stable and in fact growing money supply is an absolutely critical precondition for the sorts of economies that we live in today. If the money supply shrinks rapidly our entire economic structure falls apart. People owe each other money. And if the amount of money in circulation starts to shrink rapidly because the entities that have issued it are failing then debtors can’t pay back their debts and they start defaulting. That turns into a vicious cycle.

You can think of the failure of banks a bit like the failure of power plants. If the Long Island Power Authority just shut down and stopped working it would be very hard for any business on Long Island to continue to produce goods and services. The Fed and Congress ultimately stepped in to bail out and prevent the further collapse of this grid. Now that was necessary otherwise we would have ended up in a great depression of the same scale or probably a larger worse depression than in the ’30s.

So the Fed’s hand in 2008 was more or less forced. If we wanted to continue to operate this economy we were held hostage by the players that were providing the infrastructure upon which the economy was operating. Where things went wrong was a failure to grapple with the deep problems with continuing to have an economy in which the public and households and businesses are at the mercy of unregulated power plants that are able to basically profit off economic activity during good times and then hold the entire society as it were hostage for public support during bad times. We ended up making some changes but not addressing that fundamental problem.

Today we continue to have a dynamic where a very large financial sector is profiting off implicit and explicit public backstops and is fundamentally fragile in its design.

The pandemic was exactly such a shock. The lesson that the Fed learned from 2008 was to offer even more public support for the financial sector even faster. And in one respect that was successful. But the dynamics of that the implications for all of the rest of us of having this government agency making $3 trillion available for a bunch of financial firms that aren’t operating in the public interest this is deeply troubling. It’s a dynamic that will eventually lead to either the failure of our democracy or the failure of our economy.

A dynamic leading to a failure of our democracy seems pretty dire and significant. I want to obviously explore that in a second and explore the implications of this the quiet crash the silent crash of March 2020. In some ways the Fed never stops bailing out the economy throughout that period from late 2008 through to March of 2020.

I do think in critical respects we are still living in a 2008 financial crisis world. The acute phase of that crisis ended in early 2009 but we have not recovered from the damage.

The last 15 years are characterized by anemic growth worsening inequality that is in part a byproduct of the Fed’s effort to juice economic growth which disproportionately enriches asset owners. [We have] a financial sector that is not investing in expanding the productivity of the American economy.

We didn’t actually use this period to invest in expanding capacity. And we continue to have a financial system that is fragile.

By the time 2009 comes around you have a financial system that is very weakened. Fed officials launch a program called quantitative easing. That’s initially targeted at the housing market. And so they go and buy hundreds of billions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities.

“Quantitative easing” is this wonky phrase but there are two things about it. One is the Fed is buying securities and it didn’t used to do that; it used to just move short-term interest rates up and down. And then the second thing is it’s buying assets to help certain sectors of the economy. It’s a dramatic change that’s happening here with the Fed right?

Yeah. Look the Fed is operationally a bank. It’s supposed to be a bank just for banks. And it’s generally the way that it operated from the Second World War up to the 2008 crisis was to adjust the constraints on bank balance sheets.

Then there are subsequent rounds of QE where the Fed buys Treasury securities the federal government’s debt in an effort to bring down longer-term interest rates in the economy and further juice economic activity. So there’s not sufficient fiscal stimulus and the economy is coming back very slowly. And the Fed has moved its interest rates down to zero so that the banks can expand their balance sheets but they’re not expanding their balance sheets at a rate sufficient to allow the economy to rebound.

The mechanism by which QE works is to increase asset prices. So you have a booming stock market a booming government debt market a booming housing market even though you have an economy an underlying economy that is still weaker than it was before the 2008 crisis.

It’s a troubling way in my view to do economic policy. It might be the ninth-best approach. It’s making one group of people who are already very well off even more well off. It is a very unhealthy place for society to be.

My friend Chris Leonard has written a book called “The Lords of Easy Money” about how the Federal Reserve “broke the economy.” Here in this interregnum between crises what you’re saying is that the Fed was flooding the markets with purchasing power that was stimulating the asset markets and it was flowing to the wealthiest people asset holders already. And we got something that looked like bubbles too right? We get the crypto markets we get NFTs we get SPACs. The Fed in some ways is trapped into this because governments around the world are not spending wisely. They’re not helping the Fed out. They’re not helping the economy. In fact they’re counterproductive. They’re embracing austerity.

Yeah. The failure of the fiscal authorities of legislatures in the United States and also in Europe to address economic weakness is a source of the pressure and the motivation on the Fed to experiment with massive asset purchases as an alternative approach to avoiding an even weaker economy.

We need to recognize this was a very bad policy mix that we ended up in to inject huge amounts of liquidity into the financial system as opposed to say writing people checks or helping keep people in their homes or investing in infrastructure the way that Chinese government does.

There’s so many other ways to manage economic weakness. But if your approach is not to do any of those things and actually to restrict the amount of money available to governments and state and local governments to spend and to cause layoffs of public-sector employment if you’re not going to do any of those things and you just want to flush the financial system full of liquidity one of the problems you’re going to have is that you’re going to get bubbles in financial markets.

So let’s go back to March of 2020. It’s poorly understood. Because in some ways the government and the Fed have learned from this critique that you’re leveling. The Fed does a bunch of things it had never done before even in the financial crisis of 2008.

Yeah. In part the lesson they took from 2008 was never let things get so bad that we have a failure of a major firm like Lehman Brothers because that’s a disaster. And so when things started to deteriorate in March of 2020 when there was just a run on the shadow banking system just like there was in 2008 the Fed stepped in quickly.

It expanded its own balance sheet enormously very rapidly. It didn’t do anything like this in 2008. This was a shock-and-awe approach to suggest to anybody running on a shadow bank that there was no need to run that the Fed could take all the assets onto its own balance sheet that there wasn’t going to be a repeat of Lehman Brothers.

With some encouragement from Congress it also sets up facilities to lend to ordinary businesses and to state and local governments. But the actual dynamic when you look at it carefully is they’re getting breadcrumbs and these additional programs are helping to legitimize the much much larger and fundamentally problematic lending programs for the financial sector.

Our politics are calcified. Our political system is subject to numerous veto points. The Fed in contrast is a committee run by one guy Jerome Powell. A defender of the Fed would say: “Look they can act very quickly. Yes it goes through the financial system which helps financiers and asset holders and the wealthy disproportionately but eventually it trickles down and saves the economy. Your criticism really is with the political system not the Federal Reserve.”

There is this dynamic in which the more the Federal Reserve tries to use its financial system-based tools to respond to economic problems the more pressure it takes off the political system to produce legislative solutions that are more egalitarian and more effective at solving these same problems. A key predicate of this is our democracy doesn’t work that our politics don’t work that fundamentally legislators can’t make good policy that we need to rely on a couple of unelected technocratic experts to make policy that most Americans don’t understand that benefits the financial sector disproportionately and that’s the best we can do as a society and a polity.

I reject the idea that’s the best we can do.

We are dooming ourselves to very bad dynamics over time a declining economy really and potentially a declining society. To reinvigorate our economy and our society we have to move beyond our reliance on central bank medicine and to revive a meaningful economic legislative agenda and politics. And one thing that’s encouraging in this regard is that the last couple of years you’ve seen some of that. You’ve seen the legislature act in ways that it did not act between 2008 and 2020 reflecting some sense that mistakes were made during that period.

Now we have a very interesting and troubling period because we have the Fed confronting something much more traditional. We have an overheated economy. What do you think about the Fed’s job right now? Is the Fed doing the right thing? Is this a product of the shadow banking systems frailty or is this completely separate?

I think it’s important to recognize that the current inflationary dynamic is primarily a supply-side shock. The pandemic just scrambled the normal patterns of demand for goods and services and we ended up with shortages in certain important goods and services which caused prices to rise.

Then we have spiking commodity and energy prices due to geopolitical conflict and also due to the pandemic in various ways. The driving factors of this inflationary dynamic are not loose financial conditions.

Here again we stand the risk of over-relying on the Fed to solve a set of problems that require action by the government through a variety of other tools. So it’s certainly the case that some amount of interest rate hiking is necessary. Interest rates were too low and should be hiked. But the big question is should they continue to be hiked to the point where they choke off the whole overall economy to shrink the overall economy so that it can match up in size with the amount of oil and natural gas that’s currently being produced and the amount of key goods and services that are coming through our supply chains?

We don’t need the Fed to tighten to such an extent that it induces a recession. Instead we need other government policies targeted at supplying more of the goods and services that are experiencing this shock. It would be very unfortunate if because of the high price of oil and gas we cause people to lose jobs all across the economy.

I am cautiously optimistic that policymakers understand this now better than they have. We will be better off tolerating some amount of inflation for some period of time while the economy adjusts to an enormous shock rather than overreacting and trying to eliminate that inflation by creating a certainty of high unemployment and a bad investment outlook and climate for the economy going forward.

It’s so frustrating. The Fed functions through the financial system disproportionately helping the wealthy. It creates asset bubbles all throughout the economy. It then starts to tighten. And in doing so it disincentivizes companies from investing and growing while courting a recession that will throw millions of average people out of work after those millions of average people have only barely begun to benefit from a decade of loose financial conditions by having their wages grow.

Let me just add one more piece that will really make your head explode. There’s a very good chance that to the extent the Fed follows through on aggressive tightening in the coming months that it leads to financial instability. And so at the same time as you have the Fed pursuing policies that push up unemployment weaken the labor market and reduce business investment the Fed may well find itself standing up all of its emergency facilities again to support the shadow banking system.

Essentially because they created bubbles and now…

The shock of removing them yes is going to cause a run dynamic in the shadow banking system. It could happen at any point really.

I think it’s entirely possible. Part of the problem we have is it’s very hard for officials or academic observers and even market participants to have a handle on the balance sheet strength of financial institutions that fund themselves in the [shadow banking system]. And so it’s difficult to anticipate when a run might happen.

The Fed needs to be very cautious. It’s not actually dealing with a financial system that can necessarily go to that speed and absorb that shock. We’re in a very uncertain and risky time from an economic and financial perspective right now. Everybody should be on high alert and people should demand that their Congress try to tackle these issues and think about these problems because it’ll be much better to start moderating now than to wait for another big crash to put in place safeguards and structures that are necessary for a healthy economy and flourishing society going forward.",https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bank of America Charitable Foundation donates $370K to El Paso non-profits,"The Bank of America Charitable Foundation donated a total of $370000 to multiple local non-profit organizations in El Paso and Las Cruces Friday.

It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They’re quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.”

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

So what brought Travis back to TV for her first big role since the hit sitcom? Well the rodeo is involved!

Nancy Travis has joined the cast of Hallmark Channel’s upcoming primetime series Ride and Deadline reports that the former sitcom star will be the mother of the McMurrays as they deal with a tragedy. Named Isabel the character is the matriarch of a family in which legacy is important. They’re part of a rodeo dynasty and they have to face the challenge of maintaining their ranch when times get tough in their Colorado town. Secrets will run rampant so the family will have to try and stand strong.

The female characters seem to be central to Ride. Riverdale alum Tiera Skovbye plays Missy who is rodeo royalty but lost her husband while The Flash’s Sara Garcia is Valeria who was a teen runaway before taking what sounds like a pretty key place in the Hallmark TV show.

The cast is filled out by Good Trouble’s Beau Mirchoff as Cash McMurray who faces the weight of his family legacy despite his status as the second son. Designated Survivor alum Jake Foy plays Tuff McMurray the youngest son of Nancy Travis’ character. The show has also announced a star who won’t be playing a member of the family with Shameless actor Tyler Jacob Moore as a stranger who meets the McMurrays.

Set in Colorado Ride will film in Alberta Canada and is expected to debut next year. There are no details about how many episodes to expect or when exactly fans will get to see Nancy Travis in her new TV role as a character who sounds very different from Vanessa Baxter. Viewers who have missed her since the end of Last Man Standing will have to wait until 2023 and can only hope that the show arrives earlier in 2023 rather than close to the end.

Although Nancy Travis has said that she had a tough time with how Last Man Standing ended  she clearly wasn’t turned off from working on television. She also appeared in some other notable shows while Last Man Standing was still running as Donna Hodges in Mr. Mercedes and Lisa in The Kominsky Method.

Of course she did have to take a break from playing Vanessa when ABC cancelled the show in early 2017. More than a year passed before Fox rescued the sitcom and managed to bring back Travis and Tim Allen of the original ABC cast in 2018. Mandy and Boyd Baxter did have to be recast  and Kaitlyn Dever wasn’t able to return as a series regular. She did turn up again before the end  though!

Terumo Blood and Cell Technologies which has a facility at 11308 W. Collins Ave. was one of 23 commercial sterilization plants in the United States and Puerto Rico that were placed on the EPA’s high-risk list after an assessment that involved emissions testing and modeling the EPA announced Wednesday.

A recently completed risk assessment of the impact of Terumo’s ethylene oxide emissions “identified elevated cancer risk in the Lakewood community” the EPA wrote on its page about the Colorado location.

Terumo runs a manufacturing facility in Lakewood that makes health care products and it operates a nearby plant where that medical equipment is sterilized before it is delivered to doctors’ offices laboratories and hospitals said Jessi Done Terumo’s vice president/senior plant manager for sterilization.

The company also has a manufacturing plant in Littleton but that site does not have a sterilization facility Done said.

Ethylene oxide is used to clean everything from catheters to syringes pacemakers and plastic surgical gowns.

While short-term or infrequent exposure to ethylene oxide does not appear to pose a health risk the EPA said long-term or lifetime exposure to the chemical could lead to a variety of health problems including lymphoma and breast cancer. The EPA said it is working with commercial sterilizers to take appropriate steps to reduce emissions.

“Today EPA is taking action to ensure communities are informed and engaged in our efforts to address ethylene oxide a potent air toxic posing serious health risks with long-term exposure” EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement Wednesday.

The EPA will conduct public outreach campaigns in each of the communities where elevated risks have been found including a national public webinar on Aug. 10 and a community meeting for Lakewood residents on Oct. 25.

Terumo’s Lakewood plant holds its emissions below permitted levels Done said. The company already converts used ethylene oxide to ethylene glycol which is recycled for use as a primary ingredient in antifreeze for cars.

And in 2023 the company will install a new $22 million emissions system that will capture more ethylene oxide and reduce it to water vapor and carbon dioxide sending less into the air she said.

In 2018 the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment studied the state’s cancer registry and determined that cancer incidences among residents living near the Lakewood facility were no more elevated than in other parts of the state. Then-director Dr. Larry Wolk said the state would do more testing.

The state health department’s most recent data on Terumo’s emissions is from August to October 2018 when the agency found additional controls installed at the facility resulted in a two- to five-fold reduction in cancer risk to nearby residents spokeswoman Leah Schleifer said in an emailed statement Wednesday.

The new emissions controls resulted in a reduction in ethylene oxide concentrations around the facility.

“EPA’s new maps and data are consistent with CDPHE’s prior air sampling data and risk assessments” Schleifer wrote. “EPA’s new modeling results help us even better understand the source of ethylene oxide emissions from the facility. That gives us new and critical information to consider for regulation and permitting.”

But Done said the EPA’s estimates are based on computer modeling whereas the state has conducted actual emissions testing.

“The information the EPA will share is based on computer modeling but there’s actual testing that was done to show there is no increased incidents of cancer in the community surrounding Terumo BCT” Done said.

Lakewood Laredo Texas and Ardmore Oklahoma are among the communities facing the highest risk from ethylene oxide emissions the EPA said.

Laredo is a border city where the vast majority of residents are Latino and more than a quarter live in poverty. Missouri-based Midwest Sterilization Corp. operates a sterilization plant in Laredo. The company also owns a plant in Jackson Missouri that is on the EPA’s watch list.

More than 40% of Laredo’s nearly 70000 schoolchildren attend campuses in areas with an elevated risk of cancer due to ethylene oxide emissions from the Midwest plant according to an analysis by ProPublica and the Texas Tribune.

A spokesperson for Midwest declined immediate comment. But the company told ProPublica and the Tribune last December that the cancer risk from its Laredo plant is overstated. Emissions it reported to the EPA are “worst case scenarios” rather than specific pollution levels the company said.

The Ethylene Oxide Sterilization Association an industry group said in a statement that ethylene oxide has been used for decades by the health care community to sterilize a wide variety of medical devices and equipment. More than 20 billion health care products are sterilized each year in the U.S. alone.

In many cases there are no practical alternatives currently available to ethylene oxide the group said adding that use of less effective cleaning methods “could introduce the real risks of increased morbidity and mortality″ at hospitals throughout the country.”

The EPA called medical sterilization “a critical function that ensures a safe supply of medical devices for patients and hospitals.″ The agency said it is committed to addressing pollution concerns associated with EO sometimes called EtO “in a comprehensive way that ensures facilities can operate safely in communities while also providing sterilized medical supplies.”

Proposed rules to update control of air toxic emissions from commercial sterilizers and facilities that manufacture EtO are expected by the end of the year with final rules likely next year EPA said.

Scott Whitaker president and CEO of the Advanced Medical Technology Association another industry group applauded EPA “for its forthrightness about what it does and doesn’t know” about EtO but added: “It is critical that the EPA get this right.″

A potential shutdown of medical-device sterilization facilities “due to misinformed political pressure as well as uncertainty regarding which regulations the facilities must adhere to …. would be disastrous to public health″ Whitaker said in an email.

At least seven sterilizers on EPA’s watch list are AdvaMed members including both Midwest plants and two owned by industry giant Becton Dickinson and Co. also known as BD.

Besides medical cleansers EtO is used in a range of products including antifreeze textiles plastics detergents and adhesives. It is also used to decontaminate some food products and spices. Two of the 23 facilities targeted by EPA — in Hanover and Jessup Maryland — are used to sterilize spices. Both are operated by Jessup-based Elite Spice.

Other commercial sterilizers cited by EPA are located in Groveland Fla.; Salisbury Md.; Taunton Mass.; Columbus Nebraska; Linden and Franklin New Jersey; Erie and Zelienople Pa.; Memphis and New Tazewell Tenn.; Athens Texas; Sandy Utah; and Richmond Virginia.

Four plants are in Puerto Rico: Anasco Fajardo Salinas and Villalba.

The EPA’s announcement shines a light on health threats that sterilizer facilities pose to millions of Americans said Raul Garcia of the environmental group Earthjustice.

“Now that EPA has new information on precisely where the worst health threats are the agency must use its full authority to … require fenceline monitoring at these facilities (and) issue a strong new rule″ he said. “No one should get cancer from facilities that are used to sterilize equipment in the treatment of cancer.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lZHBhZ2V0b2RheS5jb20vc3VyZ2VyeS9nZW5lcmFsc3VyZ2VyeS8xMDAwNjTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Prosthetic Mesh May Stand in the Way of Further Abdominal Operations,"Surgical candidates with prior incisional hernia repair with mesh were prone to more complications and healthcare utilization when undergoing a subsequent operation through their prosthetic-reinforced abdominal wall a cohort study found.

When compared to surgical peers without a history of abdominal surgery reoperation through the prosthetic-mesh footprint in the abdominal wall was associated with worse outcomes after a subsequent abdominal operation:

Overall complications (OR 1.43 95% CI 1.27-1.60)

Surgical complications (OR 1.51 95% CI 1.34-1.70)

Length of hospital stay (mean increase of 1.03 days 95% CI 0.56-1.49)

Index admission charges (predicted mean difference of $11896.10 95% CI 6096.80-17695.40)

Unplanned readmissions within 1 year of operation (HR 1.14 95% CI 1.05-1.25)

""Surgeons may use these data to set appropriate expectations preoperatively when counseling patients with prior IHRWM [incisional hernia repair with mesh] who are planning to undergo abdominal surgical procedures"" according to John Fischer MD from the University of Pennsylvania Health System in Philadelphia and colleagues writing in JAMA Surgery.

""For example these results become more relevant when weighing risks and benefits during the preoperative counseling of a 35-year-old with prior IHRWM who requires resection for a Crohn stricture than when counseling a 75-year-old patient undergoing bowel resection for cancer with the latter being less likely to undergo subsequent abdominal surgical procedures in their lifetime"" the study authors added.

Fischer's team noted that the observed trend ""persisted"" even when they compared matched patients who had a prior IHRWM to those with a history of abdominal surgical procedures.

Their population-based retrospective cohort study used data from 914105 patients undergoing inpatient abdominal surgical procedures from January 2009 to December 2016 with at least 1 year of follow-up. Data were collected from five geographically diverse statewide inpatient/ambulatory databases (Florida Iowa Nebraska New York and Utah).

The 3517 patients with prior incisional hernia repair with mesh (44% in the 46-65 age range 68.1% women 67.2% white) were propensity score matched to controls without a history of abdominal surgeries. After matching common subsequent surgeries included small-bowel resection (24-26%) cholecystectomy (23-24%) colonic resection (21%) and salpingo oophorectomy (16%).

This analysis has its limitations according to Benjamin Miller MD and Michael Rosen MD both of Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.

""Comparing patients without prior abdominal surgery with those with prior incisional hernia repair with mesh is not telling the real story of the mesh footprint. We all know a reoperative abdomen is more hostile than a virgin abdomen with the potential for more complications"" the pair wrote in an editorial that accompanied the study.

""A more accurate story appears when we compare patients with prior abdominal surgery with those with prior incisional hernia repair with mesh. Compared with patients with prior abdominal surgery those with prior incisional hernia repair with mesh were only 3.2% more likely to have a surgical complication and were not more likely to undergo reoperation. The mesh footprint in this study then is small"" Miller and Rosen said.

Fischer's group also acknowledged the lack of granular clinical detail and critical operative details in the study. Mesh type mesh location and number and type of prior abdominal operations are therefore unknown the editorialists noted.

In addition there was some loss of follow-up in the dataset.

Nevertheless the study authors maintained that ""these results facilitate surgeons' work in their role as abdominal-wall stewards and emphasize the need for increased long-term surveillance of mesh implant devices and the inclusion of abdominal mesh history as a proxy of complexity when risk-stratifying patients for benchmarking research and reimbursement purposes.""

The expansion will see BHHC extend the use of Zesty.ai’s AI-powered wildfire risk model Z-FIRE™ to 12 states.

Zesty.ai pointed to a recent report from Aon which found there were three separate wildfires in 2021 alone that generated economic losses beyond $1bn. The company said this highlights the growing importance of property-specific risk models for maintaining coverage in wildfire-prone states.

The wildfire risk model not only provides regional and property-specific risk scores but also an explanation of the specific risk factors affecting the property. Using artificial intelligence that has been trained on more than 1500 wildfire events across more than 20 years of historical loss data it considers property-level features that influence risk. Topography historical climate data and critical factors extracted from high-resolution imagery such as building materials and surrounding vegetation in multiple defensible spaces are taken into account.

Zesty.ai explained that this empowers insurers with a “true property-level risk score” that effectively splits risk while providing the flexibility to recognise mitigation efforts by homeowners and their respective communities.

Brian Hall vice president of products and nderwriting at Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies said “Unfortunately wildfires are impacting communities well beyond the western US and managing that risk requires advanced models that help us truly understand wildfire risk at the individual-property level. Zesty.ai’s model has outperformed our homegrown wildfire risk model.

“We started working with Zesty.ai last year and saw an immediate opportunity to leverage granular wildfire insights that allow us to confidently write policies that commensurate with a property’s true risk.”

Earlier this year Zesty.ai raised $33m in conjunction with their Series B led by Centana Growth Partners.

Few investors have a more impressive track record than Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.61%) (BRK.B 0.60%) CEO Warren Buffett. In the 57 years he's held the reins at Berkshire he's led his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) to an average annual return of 20.1% which equates to an aggregate return of more than 3600000%.

Buffett's success as an investor is due to myriad factors including a willingness to hold investments for long periods of time as well as his love of cyclical companies and dividend stocks.

But something you may not know about the Oracle of Omaha is that he has a secret portfolio containing $6.3 billion in assets under management as of March 31 2022. While it's relatively easy to follow Buffett's trading activity via 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission you won't find these holdings in Berkshire's 13F filing.

In 1998 Buffett's company acquired insurer General Re for $22 billion. While the prized asset of the General Re buyout was the company's reinsurance operations General Re also controlled specialty investment firm New England Asset Management (NEAM).

To be perfectly clear Warren Buffett and the investing team making the decisions for Berkshire Hathaway's more than $350 billion investment portfolio don't oversee NEAM's $6.3 billion investment portfolio. Nevertheless New England Asset Management is an owned entity of Buffett's company. This means the assets held in NEAM's investment portfolio are ultimately ""owned"" by the Oracle of Omaha.

With $6.3 billion in assets under management New England Asset Management is required to file a 13F just like its parent company. But unlike Berkshire Hathaway NEAM has its fingers in more than three times as many securities as Berkshire (52 for Berkshire compared to more than 160 for NEAM).

What's similar is that Buffett's secret portfolio has invested the vast majority of its assets into a small concentration of sectors. In New England Asset Management's case 95% of its assets are invested in just the following two sectors.

Technology: 57.49% of invested assets

The sector Warren Buffett's secret portfolio unquestionably favors the most is information technology. In total NEAM has positions in 17 different tech stocks including software behemoth Microsoft semiconductor solutions-specialist Broadcom payroll solutions-provider Paychex and legacy stalwarts like HP and IBM.

But here's the jaw-dropping stat that really defines New England Asset Management's ""love of tech."" Out of the 57.49% of assets invested in information technology at the end of March virtually all of it (56.62%) was tied up in Apple (AAPL 1.00%). This means the other 16 tech stocks held by NEAM make up just 0.87% of invested assets on a combined basis!

There's certainly something to be said about Berkshire Hathaway and New England Asset Management sharing their largest positions. Then again Apple has given investors an abundance of reasons to trust in the company over the long run.

To begin with Apple is arguably the most valuable and recognized brand in the world. Earlier this year Brand Finance labeled Apple as the world's most valuable brand for a second consecutive year. Brand Finance cited the company's range of services its bolstered privacy and environmental push and its diversified product line as reasons for hanging onto the top spot among global brands.

Innovation is another reason Apple has been such a superstar for the investing community. Since Apple introduced a 5G-capable version of its iPhone in the fourth quarter of 2020 its U.S. smartphone market share has held at 50% or above in 5 out of 6 quarters according to Counterpoint Research.

But it's not just product innovation that's driving results. Apple CEO Tim Cook is overseeing an ongoing transition of his company to a service-oriented business. A subscription-driven model should help boost long-term operating margins and lessen the bumpiness often associated with product-replacement cycles. Keep in mind that Apple isn't abandoning the product line that brought it fame. The company is simply evolving in order to grow.

Apple is also in a league of its own when it comes to capital-return programs. In addition to returning more than $14 billion a year to investors in the form of a dividend the company has repurchased close to $520 billion worth of its common stock since initiating a buyback program in 2013. That's not pocket change and it's an easy way to get the attention of Warren Buffet and New England Asset Management's investment-portfolio managers.

Financials: 37.45% of invested assets

The second sector that New England Asset Management has absolutely piled into is (drum roll) financials! Did you expect anything else from a company with an insurance-based background?

As a whole NEAM holds stakes in 51 financial securities. I say ""securities"" because NEAM invests in stocks exchange-traded funds and preferred stock. But once again only a small handful of these investments account for the lion's share of the 37.45% of invested assets tied up in financial stocks. This includes U.S. Bancorp (USB -0.36%) Bank of America (BAC 1.51%) the SPDR S&P 500 ETF and the Bank of New York Mellon.

Together these four securities account for 32.98% of the 37.45% in financial sector-invested assets. You might note that Berkshire Hathaway has stakes in all four of these financial securities too in its portfolio.

Regional bank U.S. Bancorp and money-center giant Bank of America each make up about 14.9% of invested assets (29.8% on a combined basis). When held for long periods of time bank stocks benefit from the disproportionately longer period of time the U.S. economy spends expanding relative to contracting.

Although downturns are inevitable the U.S. economy naturally expands over time. That allows U.S. Bancorp and Bank of America to grow their loans and deposits.

Bank of America and U.S. Bancorp are also benefiting from a combination of rising interest rates and digitization investments. The former noted in its June-ended quarterly investor presentation that a 100 basis-point parallel shift in the interest-rate yield curve would generate an estimated $5 billion in added net-interest income over 12 months.

Meanwhile U.S. Bancorp has set the standard for digital engagement. It ended June with 82% of its active customers banking digitally and had 64% of total sales completed online or via its app. Since digital transactions cost a fraction of what in-person or phone-based transactions do this digital push is helping boost U.S. Bancorp's efficiency.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) has an equity investment portfolio worth more than $360 billion as of the end of the first quarter of this year making it one of the largest investors of any kind in the world.

Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio is filled with quality stocks and generally ones that pay dividends. You can learn from Warren Buffett’s stock picks to find ones for your individual portfolio. That’s because Buffett (and other institutional investors) are required to periodically show their holdings in a 13F Filing.

As of March 31st 2022 Berkshire owned just over 7.7 million shares of Formula One Group (FWONK) for a market value exceeding $500 million. That makes Berkshire a sizable owner of Formula One at about 3.8% although the half-billion dollar position is a very small fraction of Berkshire’s total portfolio.

In this article we’ll examine the business of Formula One as well as its future growth prospects and expected total returns.

Business Overview

Formula 1 is a motor racing series that has events held across the globe. The company holds the commercial rights for the Formula 1 World Championship a motor racing competition that spans about nine months of the year where drivers compete for the drivers’ championship and the teams compete at the constructors level.

Formula 1 has been in continuous existence since 1950 when the first World Championship was held. Today the Championship is 23 races in 21 countries across five continents and reaches hundreds of millions of fans globally.

Formula One Group is a subsidiary of Liberty Media Corporation (LSXMA). The former trades with what is called a “tracking stock” rather than a traditional listing as do all of Liberty’s subsidiaries. Liberty owns interests in various assets including Formula One Group and lists tracking stocks that are intended to track the economic performance of a business rather than the economic performance of the company as a whole (Liberty in this case). Formula One Group has three classes of tracking stock as do Liberty’s other listed assets; Series A shares have 1 vote per share Series B shares have 10 votes per share and Series C shares are non-voting.

Formula One generates about $2.5 billion in annual revenue and trades with a market cap of more than $15 billion.

The Group’s most recent earnings report was for the quarter ended June 30th 2022 which was released on August 5th 2022.

The group reported strong revenue and even better adjusted operating income but we note that the comparable period last year still contained COVID restrictions in certain parts of the world for in-person sporting events. As such the Group had easy comparables for this year’s Q2.

Source: Q2 earnings release

Even so revenue was up sharply adding 49% year-over-year. The gain was made from a 35% increase in what the Group calls “Primary” revenue which is derived from race promotion revenue media rights fees and sponsorship fees. That rose due to contractual fees media rights through F1 TV subscriptions as well as rights of outside parties broadcasting F1 events.

The second category of revenue which the Group calls “Other” revenue soared more than 200% in Q2. This was driven by an increase in freight revenue from the number of events held outside of Europe in Q2 which is away from most of the teams’ home bases. In addition hospitality revenue from the Paddock Club which was closed in 2021’s Q2 helped drive in-person revenue at events.

Operating income soared from a loss of $43 million in the year-ago period to a gain of $49 million in this year’s Q2. The Group also repurchased $146 million in 1% cash convertible notes that were due next year which effectively retired 3.95 million shares of common stock.

Let’s now turn our attention to the company’s growth prospects.

Growth Prospects

Formula One’s growth has been quite erratic in recent years as COVID-19 took a heavy toll on the sport’s ability to monetize its events. Going forward we see normalized growth of about 8% per year from a recovery that still isn’t complete from COVID. We think sponsorship and media rights revenue will drive these gains and that items that are temporarily subject to inflationary pressures like freight revenue will moderate.

Source: Company website

The company notes that it has significantly increased its social media reach and that it is attracting an average of 71 million viewers per race. The audience is truly global and the Group is finding more and more ways to monetize those users over time both in-person and digitally. As the sport continues to gain popularity the Group’s revenue should rise over time.

Competitive Advantages & Recession Performance

Formula One’s competitive advantage is quite simple in that it is the pinnacle of circuit racing globally and has been for seven decades. This gives it a moat that is untouched by other racing series and with the sport growing more each year we only see that advantage growing. This is particularly true as the sport goes more mainstream with alternative outlets such as the Netflix Drive to Survive series generating interest among previous non-viewers of the sport.

That said like most sports Formula One is highly reliant upon advertising and consumer discretionary spending both of which tend to suffer during recessions. We see the next recession as unkind to the Group’s earnings and likely the share price as a result. This is not a recession resistant stock.

Valuation & Expected Returns

Since Formula One doesn’t have reliable earnings we’ll use price-to-book value instead. The Group reported book value of about $27 per share and it trades at 2.3 times that value today. However its average over the past five years is a price-to-book multiple of 1.7 which means it’s significantly overvalued today. That could drive a 6% headwind to total returns in the coming years nearly fully offsetting our estimated growth of 8%. Formula One does not pay dividends to shareholders.

Final Thoughts

We see Formula One as a very unique and highly desirable media property. However the company’s history of inconsistent earnings lack of a dividend and high valuation have us steering clear for now. With total expected returns of under 2% we rate Formula One a sell.

Other Dividend Lists

Value investing is a valuable process to combine with dividend investing. The following lists contain many more high-quality dividend stocks:"

The Rakuten shopping portal has increased in-store cash back rates at several useful retailers over the weekend. They’re offering 3% (or 3x Membership Rewards) back for purchases in-store at Sam’s Club Walmart and Best Buy as well as other useful nuggets like 6% back at Old Navy and 15% at Macy’s.

Key Terms

Offer expires 8/7/2022 at 20:59 PST.

Offer valid for a limited time and may be removed or modified by Rakuten at any time.

Offer not valid for gift card purchases.

Debit card purchases must be processed as credit in order to be eligible for Cash Back. When using your debit card do not enter your PIN.

Only US-issued payment cards are eligible to enroll and earn Cash Back.

In-Store offers not valid for online purchases and may not be combined with other Rakuten rewards.

US stores only. Offer not valid at locations in US territories.

If you link to the same offer on more than one site your qualifying transaction will only be eligible for rewards or benefits associated with the offer through the most recently linked site.

A linked offer is good for 1 hour after initial redemption. After such time the offer must be re-linked prior to your next purchase.

A linked offer that has not been redeemed will automatically expire on the date the offer itself ends.

Quick Thoughts

There are bunch of decent retailers with increased cashback offers over the weekend on Rakuten but 3% cashback or 3x Membership Rewards for in-store purchases at Sam’s Club Walmart and Best Buy will be especially useful to a lot of folks. Just make sure to link your card to Rakuten AND activate the offer before shopping.

While the terms exclude gift card purchases it’s hard to know whether Rakuten will be enforcing those terms or not…sometimes they do and sometimes they don’t. So be aware that there’s some potential for clawbacks if you decide to buy gift cards in-store with these offers. Many of the listed retailers have third party gift card racks so it’s certainly tempting…YMMV."

To investigate the affinity of ScNtx for the native purified Torpedo muscle-type nAChR reconstituted in asolectin-MSP1E3D1 lipidic nanodiscs we employed microscale thermophoresis (MST) with a fluorescently labeled variant of ScNtx ScNtx-NT647. Firstly we performed a binding check to confirm the binding of ScNtx to the receptor (Fig. 1a). Subsequently the change in normalized fluorescence as a function of Torpedo nAChR concentration was determined revealing an apparent affinity of 28 nM (Fig. 1b). This observation confirms the tight interaction of the short-chain ScNtx with muscle-type nAChRs. To further investigate the molecular basis for this interaction we determined the structure of the Torpedo nAChR in complex with ScNtx using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) in the presence of a megabody Mbc7HopQ that helped randomize orientations18 (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The dataset allowed us to obtain a 3D reconstruction with an overall resolution of 3.15 Å and a local resolution better than 2.5 Å for the extracellular domain (ECD) including two bound toxins (Fig. 1c–f and Supplementary Fig. 1c–d Table 1). The overall architecture is consistent with previously determined structures of the Torpedo nAChR and consists of five subunits α γ -γ-α δ -δ-β (Fig. 1c–f Supplementary Fig. 2)1419. When viewed from the top these subunits are radially arranged in a counterclockwise manner around a central ion-conducting pore. Each subunit consists of an ECD formed by a short N-terminal α-helix and ten β-strands a transmembrane domain (TMD) composed of four transmembrane α-helices and an intracellular domain (ICD). The ICD is composed of the post-M3 helix (MX) the intracellular helix (MA) and a disordered linker between the third and fourth transmembrane helix. However in our structure this ICD was not resolved due to lack of cryo-EM density except for the MX helices of the α γ and β subunits. The absence of the ICD which might be due to its preferential interaction with the air-water interface to disc reconstitution conditions or to natural flexibility does not impact the ECD conformation and the binding of ScNtx.

Table 1 Contacts between ScNtx/α-Bgtx and the α δ -δ interface of the Torpedo nAChR Full size table

When viewed from the side (Fig. 1e f) the Torpedo nAChR-ScNtx complex resembles a T-shape with two toxin molecules extending nearly parallel to the membrane. Similar to the receptor in complex with α-(α-Bgtx)14 two ScNtx molecules are bound at the neurotransmitter binding sites located at the α γ -γ interface and the α δ -δ interface where they are stabilized by interactions with both the principal α (+) and complementary γ/δ (−) subunit. A superposition of the Torpedo receptor structures in the α-Bgtx onto the ScNtx-complex reveals a root mean square deviation (R.M.S.D) of 1.27 Å for C α atoms indicating that the conformation of the Torpedo nAChR is virtually identical in both complexes. As α-Bgtx ScNtx acts as a competitive antagonist by stabilizing the ion channel pore in a resting state14.

Comparison with the α-Bungarotoxin bound Torpedo nAChR structure reveals a different binding mode for long chain α-neurotoxins versus short-chain α-neurotoxins

ScNtx is composed of 60 residues adopting the typical three-finger fold of α-neurotoxins (Fig. 2a–e). This three-fingered hand consists of three β-stranded loops (fingers I–III) extending from a globular core containing four disulfide bridges (Fig. 2a–e and Supplementary Fig. 3). Both for ScNtx and α-Bgtx 24 % of their available surface area is buried by the receptor (1130 Å2 for α-Bgtx 1040 Å2 for ScNtx) (Supplementary Table 2). Similar to α-Bgtx loop C from the principal side (α subunit) and loop F from the complementary side (δ/γ subunit) pinch onto finger II of the toxin (Fig. 2b). This finger is positioned behind loop C which is in an extended conformation. Whereas the position of the conserved arginine residue at the tip of finger II (R31 in ScNtx R36 in α-Bgtx) is similar in both toxins a clear tilt of ScNtx is observed towards the complementary side (Fig. 2b d e and Supplementary Fig. 3). This results in the bottom part of loop F being tightly grasped between finger II and III of ScNtx. The tilt is most obvious when viewed from the base of the three-fingered hand which is formed by loops connecting the different β-strands (Fig. 2d–e and Supplementary Fig. 3). When measured between ScNtx and α-Bgtx after superposing both toxin receptor complexes the displacement of these loops amounts to 7.9 Å for the β2–β3 loop 6.7 Å for the β4-β5 loop and 10.4 Å for the β5-Cterm loop (Fig. 2e). In addition to this tilt a 13 Å displacement of the tip of finger I is observed when measured between the two toxins (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 3). Consequently finger I adopts a markedly different conformation in ScNtx and is in a position allowing equivalent interactions with the principal side as those formed by the extended C-terminus of α-Bgtx (Fig. 2c). Notwithstanding the displacement of finger I it still stacks against the branched N-glycan attached to αN141 in the Cys-loop like finger I of α-Bgtx14. Interestingly these glycan residues adopt a different conformation in both structures allowing interactions with both ScNtx and α-Bgtx regardless of their different binding mode (Supplementary Fig. 4). This reinforces the vital role of N-linked glycan interactions in α-neurotoxin binding to nAChRs.

The key role of loop F residues in accommodating short-chain α-neurotoxins

In addition to the different binding modes of ScNtx and α-Bgtx the number and nature of the individual interactions within the neurotransmitter binding site differ substantially. An extensive analysis of these contacts was made by comparing the molecular interactions of both toxins with the receptor across the entire ligand binding site (Fig. 3 Table 1 Supplementary Movie 1). Here we describe interactions with the principal (α δ ) and complementary (δ) subunit for finger I II and III. The contact analysis at the α-γ interface is similar except for finger II of α-Bgtx which forms a higher number of interactions at the complementary side than α-Bgtx at the α-δ interface. However the overall conclusion remains the same for both interfaces (Table 1 Supplementary Table 3).

Dashed lines indicate hydrogen bonds or salt bridges. Color code as in Fig. 2. The orientations are chosen so that the described interactions are clear (Supplementary Movie 1).

First we zoom in on the interactions between finger I of ScNtx and α-Bgtx and the principal subunit (Fig. 3a b). Finger I interacts with loop C which was previously identified as a major molecular determinant of α-neurotoxin binding to nAChRs20. In the case of ScNtx αW187 αY189 and αY190 as well as αT191 and αP194 that are situated at the tip of loop C are involved in this interaction. In contrast the tip of finger I of α-Bgtx is in a different conformation and flipped away from the tip of loop C thereby forming interactions that are limited to αW187 and αY18914. Remarkably the extended C-terminus of α-Bgtx adopts a conformation similar to finger I of ScNtx thereby forming equivalent interactions with residues at the tip of loop C namely αY190 αT191 αP194 and an additional interaction with αC192. In summary loop C residues on the principal side are involved in interactions that are roughly similar in the ScNtx versus α-Bgtx complex. However the partnering residues at the level of the toxin differ due to the different conformation of finger I in α-Bgtx. This is compensated by the extended C-terminus of α-Bgtx forming interactions comparable to finger I of ScNtx.

Next we zoom in on the interactions between finger II and the principal (α δ ) subunit (Fig. 3c d). One of the hallmark features present in all previously determined structures of nAChRs and AChBP homologs in complex with long-chain α-neurotoxins is a unique cation-π interaction in which the highly conserved R36 in finger II is sandwiched between Y198 of loop C and F32 of α-Bgtx14. Interestingly the side chain of R31 of ScNtx (equivalent to R36 in α-Bgtx) adopts a different rotamer conformation precluding the formation of a cation-π sandwich. Instead R31 forms two H-bonds with αY190 in loop C. This αY190 adopts a key role in accommodating both ScNtx and α-Bgtx at the principal side. However the nature of its interactions is markedly different. In the case of ScNtx it is involved in an extensive network of four H-bonds two with R31 one with D29 and one with S8. By contrast it is in an edge-to-face orientation relative to the cation-π sandwich formed in the α-Bgtx-bound structure and forms two H-bonds with D30 and H68 of α-Bgtx. In summary the highly conserved arginine residue in finger II is involved in key interactions namely a cation-π sandwich in the α-Bgtx complex and H-bonds in the ScNtx complex. This arginine residue plays a key role in anchoring the toxin deep into the neurotransmitter binding site and its position is virtually identical despite the different orientations of the two toxins.

Additionally both toxins interact with the long branched N-glycan derived from a conserved αN141 residue in the Cys-loop of the principal subunit through H-bonds (Fig. 3a–d). As described above this N-glycan adopts a different conformation in both toxin-receptor complexes (Supplementary Fig. 4). However the detailed conformation of each unique sugar molecule cannot be determined unambiguously. Depending on the position of the hydroxyl groups H-bonds are formed with finger I or finger II of ScNtx.

On the complementary side (Fig. 3e–h) the interaction network of finger II-III is markedly different between the two toxins due to the tilt of ScNtx compared to α-Bgtx. Except for two residues of loop F namely δL121 which interacts with F32 of α-Bgtx and δF184 which is involved in a H-bond with K45 of ScNtx all interactions with finger II and III of the toxins involve the same six receptor residues for both toxins (Fig. 3e–h Table 1) namely δT38 from loop G δW57 from loop D and δD165 δD180 δP181 and δE182 of loop F. These six residues interact with seven different residues of α-Bgtx resulting in 13 Van der Waals (VdW) interactions. In contrast nine different residues from ScNtx form 22 VdW interactions one H-bond (between δE182 and K45) and three salt bridges (two between δD165 and R28 and one between δE182 and K25) with the same six receptor residues. This observation illustrates how the tilting motion of ScNtx toward the complementary side results in a much broader network of interactions. Thus the complementary side especially loop F plays a key role in the tight interaction of ScNtx with the Torpedo nAChR.

Collectively our analysis shows that ScNtx and α-Bgtx both of which share a common three-finger fold engage in substantially different interactions with the Torpedo nAChR possibly explaining long- and short-chain specific interactions with muscle-type receptors.

Functional characterization of structure-based mutants of ScNtx

We used automated two-electrode voltage clamp (HiClamp) to perform an in-depth pharmacological and electrophysiological characterization of ScNtx. We determined the concentration-inhibition relationship of ScNtx on different nAChR subtypes (Fig. 4a–c Table 2). The inhibition by ScNtx of acetylcholine-induced currents is the most pronounced in case of the Torpedo muscle-type nAChR (IC 50 = 25 nM). The human muscle-type and neuronal α7 nAChRs are inhibited with comparable IC 50 values (61 nM and 76 nM respectively) (Fig. 4a b). The current recovery after inhibition is vastly different. Only a slow and partial recovery is observed for the muscle-type nAChRs (Fig. 4a) whereas the α7 nAChR displays an instantaneous and complete recovery after inhibition (Fig. 4b) indicating a tighter binding mode for ScNtx on muscle-type receptors. No inhibition was observed on the α4β2 nAChR (Fig. 4c). This was unsurprising since ScNtx interacts with Y189 and P194 from the Torpedo nAChR. The equivalent residues in the α4 subunit (K189 and I196) confer α-Bgtx insensitivity on the neuronal α4β2 nAChR21. To further analyze the different binding modes in muscle and α7 receptors alanine-scanning mutagenesis was performed by mutating residues at the tip of the three toxin fingers. Mutation of finger I residues (S8A and S9A) prevented expression of ScNtx indicating that these residues are crucial for protein folding or expression. In contrast all other mutants of both finger II and finger III expressed readily and were purified in a biochemically stable state leading to a total of eight available ScNtx mutants.

Table 2 IC50 values and Hill coefficients for wild-type ScNtx and mutants on the neuronal α7 nAChR and the muscle-type nAChR Full size table

To extrapolate our findings to human receptors we determined IC 50 values for all these mutants on both the human muscle-type and α7 nAChR. Striking differences were observed (Table 2). On the muscle-type receptor these mutations have no effect except for K25A (finger II) R31A (finger II) and K45A (finger III) which attenuate inhibition by ScNtx. In contrast on α7 receptors all mutations either completely abolish or diminish inhibition by ScNtx. For example the finger II mutation R28A has no effect on inhibition of the muscle receptor (Fig. 4d h) but this mutation completely abolishes the inhibition of α7 receptors (Fig. 4e I). Similar effects were observed for other finger II mutations namely D29A R31A (Fig. 4g i) and G32A (Table 2). Additionally on α7 receptors we observed an increase of the IC 50 values for K25A and H30A (finger II) and all finger III mutants (K45A P46A and G47A). In contrast most mutations do not cause a drastic change in the IC 50 value on muscle receptors indicating a tighter interaction of ScNtx at these receptors. Only R31A (Fig. 4f h) K25A and K45A exhibit an increased IC 50 value on muscle receptors. These results are consistent with the structural data. The highly conserved arginine residue at the tip of finger II R31 penetrates deep into the binding site and is involved in four VdW interactions and two H-bonds with αY190 and as such a key determinant of short-chain α-neurotoxin binding to the principal subunit (Fig. 3c Table 1). K25 and K45 are involved in 12 intermolecular contacts with the complementary side including a salt bridge and two H-bonds (Fig. 3g Table 1). It is thus not surprising that mutating K25 R31 and K45 causes a significant increase of the IC 50 values. By combining these three mutations in a triple mutant ScNtx (K25A + R31A + K45A) the inhibition of the muscle-type nAChR was completely abolished. We thus demonstrate that K25 R31 and K45 all highly conserved (Supplementary Fig. 5) are key determinants for short-chain α-neurotoxin binding to the muscle-type nAChR.

Interestingly an increase of IC 50 values is not observed for R28 and D29 though both residues are involved in a number of interactions with the complementary and principal side respectively. R28 forms two VdW interactions and two salt bridges with δD165 whereas the highly conserved D29 forms three VdW interactions and one H-bond with αY190 (Fig. 3e c and Table 1). These latter interactions are possibly compensated by the tight interaction between αY190 with R31. All other mutations in ScNtx concern residues that are solely involved in VdW interactions and have no effect on muscle receptors. These mutations are likely compensated by the large network of interactions between ScNtx and the complementary face of the binding site.

In conclusion we demonstrate two crucial differences in the properties of ScNtx on muscle-type versus the α7 nAChR. First the recovery after inhibition by ScNtx is slow and only partial on muscle-type receptors compared to an instantaneous and full recovery on α7 receptors (Fig. 4a b). Second the mutagenesis data demonstrate that mutations at the toxin-receptor interface have much more pronounced effects on α7 receptors than muscle-type receptors (Table 2). Combined these results are consistent with a tighter interaction of ScNtx with muscle-type receptors possibly explaining subtype-specific actions of short-chain α-neurotoxins on nAChRs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaC5ldS8yMDIyLzA4LzA1L3N1bW1hLWVxdWl0eS1sb29rcy13ZXN0LW9wZW5zLW9mZmljZS1pbi1wYWxvLWFsdG8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Summa Equity looks west opens office in Palo Alto,"With $2.4 billion to work with Stockholm-based Summa Equity lays claim to Europe’s largest impact fund (although its founder is not a fan of the term). To date the firm has collected a portfolio with no less than 23 investments all tied to the UNs SDGs many of which call Europe home. However as of today Summa turns its attention westward and is opening an office in Palo Alto California.

Heading up the hunt are Summa partners Tommi Unkuri Gustavo Salem and Nick Roelofs who will be joined by a number of Summa staff including investment director Anna Ryrberg.

“Summa has never been bound to its Nordic roots in the companies we work with. Our strategy is non-geographical non-sector and non-asset class specific. Opening a West Coast office is an extension of this approach: we are not just looking at American companies but looking to attract and work with some of the world’s leading minds on how we can transform the world” explained Summa Equity founder and managing partner Reynir Indahl. “Today’s interventions are the innovations of the past - Summa invests in global transformation.”

Having cast a rather wide investment net the next challenge for Summa is finding the next healthcare-related startup that meets its stringent criteria. According to the company they’ll be investing in companies that “develop innovative and transformative solutions that make healthcare more predictive preventive personalized and participative.”

Considering Unkuri’s strong background (and board seats) in a number of health techs Salem’s experience with life science tools and diagnostics companies and Roelofs’ time at Baxter Healthcare Applied Biosystems Stratagene Bio-Rad and Agilent it would appear that Summa has the optimal eyes and ears and boots for the job on the ground.

“The Summa approach is very unique. In leading the Changing Demographics theme at Summa we are seeking transformative companies that will deliver positive outcomes for communities across the globe and enable people to prosper” commented Unkiri. “Such businesses typically deliver sustainable growth and achieve continued long-term success whilst creating value for the wider public.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzE5MzQ1OTA5MjIwMDMwMDnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lipid accumulation induced by APOE4 impairs microglial surveillance of neuronal-network activity,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1934590922003009 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzE5MzQ1OTA5MjIwMDMwMDnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Chuck Kummeth who as CEO since 2013 more than tripled the size of Bio-Techne will leave the company in the summer of 2024.

""During the last nine years Chuck has done an extraordinary job accelerating growth building a strong leadership team and positioning Bio-Techne for the future"" Robert Baumgartner Bio-Techne's board chair said in a statement.

Kummeth steered the firm through 17 acquisitions. Under his leadership Bio-Techne's revenue grew from approximately $311 million to $1.1 billion. Its employee base grew from 800 to 3000.

Before joining Bio-Techne Kummeth held leadership positions at Thermo Fisher Scientific and 3M.

""My background is a lot of M&A. That's one of the reasons I was hired"" Kummeth said in an interview. He credits about half of the company's growth during his tenure to those acquisitions. ""I did it for many years at 3M.""

Bio-Techne makes proteins and reagents such as antibodies that can be used by research and clinical diagnostic markets. Its products can be used by drug developers in a wide range of medical research categories including cancer cell and gene therapy cardiovascular biology and immunology.

The announcement of Kummeth's exit caught some company watchers by surprise. Alex Nowak senior research analyst at Minneapolis-based Craig-Hallum Capital Group wrote to investors: ""A two-year CEO retirement transition was also a surprise and certainly will be hard shoes to fill.""

On a morning conference call analyst Puneet Souda of Boston-based SVB Securities told Kummeth ""I wish you weren't retiring.""

As a member of Bio-Techne's board of directors Kummeth will play a role in picking his successor.

""We have a two-year glide path to do it. There's no hurry"" Kummeth said.

In fiscal fourth quarter ended June 30 Bio-Techne said its profit nearly quadrupled to $61.5 million or $1.51 a diluted share. The bottom line was helped by a one-time accounting gain and a comparison against a quarter when it had a one-time charge.

Adjusted for one-time items it earned $2.05 a share slightly below analysts' consensus estimate of $2.08 but up from $1.88 a year ago.

Revenue rose 11.3% to $288.2 million and helped Bio-Techne climb to $1.1 billion for its full fiscal year. That was up nearly 19% from the previous fiscal year.

The company's stock closed down 0.2% on Thursday.

Kummeth told investors Bio-Techne had an ""incredible"" year and was positioned to continue its momentum. Demand was robust for proteomic reagents and analytical tools.

Its protein sciences business which accounted for about three-fourths of its revenue experienced a 16% jump in sales in the April-through-June period. The unit's operating margin narrowed somewhat to about 45% from 47% a year earlier.

Sales in its blood chemistry and diagnostics business its second-biggest operation rose about 7%. The business also experienced a slightly narrower operating margin.

Bio-Techne joined the S&P 500 in 2021. Kummeth said that the next CEO could expand Bio-Techne to the size of a Fortune 500 company. In 2021 it took revenue of at least $5.4 billion to make the Fortune list.

""It's very doable"" Kummeth said. ""I think this company has an incredible future ahead of it and we'll make sure that the leadership is of the caliber to make that happen.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzE5MzQ1OTA5MjIwMDMwMzTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dynamic and adaptive cancer stem cell population admixture in colorectal neoplasia,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1934590922003034 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzE5MzQ1OTA5MjIwMDMwMzTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

According to the minutes of the Central Pharmaceutical Advisory Committee’s meeting disclosed by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety the committee members said Biogen’s phase 3 Study 302 results were “insufficient to be recognized as a confirmatory clinical trial.”

The Study 302 trial did not meet the primary and secondary endpoints meaning that the trial failed statistically. Thus the trial results were not enough to grant the permit the review panel said.

Biogen’s Alzheimer’s disease treatment Aduhelm may fail to win marketing approval in Korea the minutes of the drug review panel showed.

Unlike in the U.S. Biogen did not apply for conditional approval for Aduhelm based on data of a biomarker (amyloid beta reduction effect) in Korea.

The review panel’s latest opinion raises the possibility that the drug regulator could refuse to grant the permit for Aduhelm.

Although the committee members noted that they could re-discuss the issue if necessary Biogen said it has yet to decide on whether to revise the approval application or to submit a new application.

In other words the company has not decided on whether to seek new approval based on biomarker data just like it did in the U.S. or give up on the market release in Korea.

The minutes showed that the review committee members gave a hardheaded assessment of Aduhelm.

One member who evaluated the Study 302 outcome from a clinical statistical point of view said the study was interrupted “due to the predefined declaration of futility.”

“We can’t recognize post hoc analysis after the declaration of futility” the panelist said.

Another member said drug-related endpoints used in brain disorders are so volatile that even a small correction of data can change the overall outcome.

“Changing the dosage protocol in the middle of a study of such a sensitive drug could affect the overall result. So we cannot accept this analysis from a statistical point of view” the member said.

In contrast neurology clinicians who participated in the meeting expressed regret that the clinical value of Aduhelm and the biomarker were not discussed.

One clinician said Alzheimer’s and cancer are similar in that there is no cure.

“When Alzheimer’s trials are failing it is meaningful to use the improvement of the biomarker in the drug assessment” the clinician said.

When seeking marketing approval for Aduhelm in Korea Biogen reportedly submitted a plan to manage amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) a common problem in anti-amyloid antibodies.

ARIA was reported in 41 percent of Aduhelm-treated patients drawing keen attention. However researchers found that it was not a problem in a particular drug but a side effect in all anti-amyloid agents.

The review committee also discussed Aduhelm’s ARIA risk. An ARIA event in a clinical trial under the strict control of the environment could be managed immediately. However it could be a serious issue in real clinical settings and Aduhelm needs a strict ARIA risk management strategy the review panel said.

Still one member said “As less than 10 percent of the participants discontinued the treatment ARIA risk will not be a big problem as long as it is managed well.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZXBoYXJtYS5jb20vcGhhcm1hL2VsaS1saWxseS1sb2dzLTYxbS1sb3NzLW1lZGljYWlkLWZyYXVkLXN1aXTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Eli Lilly takes $61M hit in Medicaid whistleblower lawsuit but remains adamant it will 'ultimately prevail',"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.fiercepharma.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /pharma/eli-lilly-logs-61m-loss-medicaid-fraud-suit (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D82F9BFA0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZXBoYXJtYS5jb20vcGhhcm1hL2VsaS1saWxseS1sb2dzLTYxbS1sb3NzLW1lZGljYWlkLWZyYXVkLXN1aXTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,

Coinbase announced on Thursday BlackRock would start offering bitcoin trading and custody services to its clients despite the current cryptocurrency bear market.

BlackRock's institutional clients will be able to purchase bitcoin on the asset manager's Aladdin platform with Coinbase providing the access to the largest cryptocurrency.

Commenting on the news Joseph Chalom global head of strategic ecosystem partnerships at BlackRock said: “Our institutional clients are increasingly interested in gaining exposure to digital asset markets.”

This marks a turn of fortune for Coinbase which has struggled throughout the year laying off 18% of its workforce as recessionary fears shed more than $2trn off the crypto industry’s market cap.

On the news Coinbase shares soared 17.1% to $95. This marks a trend reversal for the crypto exchange that has seen its share price plummet from $342 when it went public in April 2021.

Having already announced its willingness to offer clients exposure to cryptocurrencies in February the move signals the asset manager’s interest in cryptocurrencies.

In January BlackRock filed for a blockchain equity ETF that offers exposure to blockchain and crypto companies.

Across the traditional financial industry Goldman Sachs Citibank Bank of American and Morgan Stanley have all started to explore digital asset products amid growing market demand.

Its popularity has driven a disproportionate amount of capital into residential real estate — particularly from institutional funds — pushing up valuations and pushing yields lower.

Real estate investment giants continue to buy up homes — something that is likely here to stay even with higher mortgage rates. In fact Blackstone is close to finalizing what could be the biggest traditional private-equity real estate investment fund in history according to the Wall Street Journal.

In a regulatory filing last month Blackstone said that it has secured $24.1 billion of commitments for its latest real estate fund called Blackstone Real Estate Partners X. Combined with Blackstone’s real estate funds in Asia and Europe the company will have over $50 billion available for opportunistic investments.

In the event of a market downturn Blackstone will have plenty of capital to scoop up some attractive real estate bargains.

But earning a good yield isn’t easy in today’s economic climate. The gross rental yield for a typical New York apartment is just 2.9%. The dividend yield on residential REITs is also mediocre.

Low single-digit yields are tough to swallow in an environment where interest rates are rising and inflation is at 9.1%.

Investors need to look beyond residential properties. Here are some niche REITs that offer better returns.

This niche REIT offers an 8.6% dividend yield and trades at 1.9 times book value per share.

Cannabis Warehouses

Legal cannabis has been a volatile sector. It’s still a highly regulated and intensely competitive industry. In aggregate cannabis stocks have disappointed investors. By comparison leasing warehouse space to cannabis producers has been a better business model.

Story continues

Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR) owns and operates one of the largest networks of cannabis warehouses across the US. As of June 2022 the company had 111 properties comprising an aggregate of approximately 8.4 million rentable square feet with 100% leased out to state-licensed cannabis operators.

The REIT offers a 7.1 % dividend yield and trades at 1.7 times book value.

Mortgage REITs

Most REITs focus on the equity portion of the properties they acquire. In other words they put money down to buy properties pay interest on the mortgage and collect rents — a traditional landlord model.

However some REITs focus on acquiring mortgages and collecting rents. This is a capital-light model that could lead to better yields if managed properly.

Starwood Property Trust (STWD) is the largest mortgage REIT in the country. The Greenwich Conn. company specializes in commercial mortgages. Since its inception it has deployed over $83 billion to multifamily investors oil and gas producers hotel managers retail stores and enterprises for their property purchases.

Mortgage REITs like Starwood are more vulnerable to rising interest rates. That’s because the business model hinges on the net interest margin — the gap between borrowing and lending money. As interest rates rise in 2022 Starwood could see its net margin compress. Its portfolio of outstanding loans could also see lower valuations.

At the moment the REIT offers an 8.1% dividend yield and trades at just 1.15 times book value per share. It’s clearly out of favor now but could deliver exceptional returns if interest rates plateau next year.

Starwood is an ideal target for investors with an appetite for high-risk high-reward wagers.

Mr. Kelter added “Our priority for this transaction was to identify a company with exceptional leadership and operational expertise to take public and with which we could develop a true partnership. As a private company Bridger has attracted the support of leading institutional investors and counts as equity holders some of the leading financial institutions and asset managers in the world. With its strong recurring revenue model experienced management team and industry-leading aircraft fleet the Company is well-positioned to grow and create significant and sustained value for investors and all stakeholders as it works to meet critical environmental and community needs.”

Transaction Overview

The business combination values Bridger at an implied $869 million pro forma enterprise value. The transaction which does not have a minimum cash requirement or require a PIPE offering is expected to deliver up to approximately $345 million of cash to Bridger’s balance sheet assuming no redemptions by Jack Creek’s public shareholders and before payment of transaction expenses leaving the Company better positioned to further expand its fleet and explore proprietary strategic investments.

The Boards of Directors of both Bridger and Jack Creek have unanimously approved the proposed business combination which is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2022 subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions including the approval of Jack Creek’s shareholders.

Bloomberg — Blackstone Inc. Chief Executive Officer Stephen Schwarzman played a pivotal -- and until now little-known -- role in securing a 2018 agreement between Donald Trump and Justin Trudeau to preserve free trade among the US Canada and Mexico according to Jared Kushner.

The buyout mogul’s intervention took place in late September 2018 on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York the former president’s senior adviser and son-in-law writes in his new book “Breaking History: A White House Memoir.” The 512-page book is set for release on Aug. 23 and portions of it were shared in advance with Bloomberg News.

The US had reached an agreement the previous month with Mexico but remained at odds with Canada over access for US dairy producers to the protected market of America’s northern neighbor. Kushner knew that Schwarzman was planning to meet with Trudeau.

“Please let the prime minister know that his negotiators are about to blow up a $600 billion trade relationship over butter” Kushner recalls telling the Blackstone chairman co-founder and CEO feeling that Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland was holding out. “They are playing chicken with the wrong guy. Trump would be thrilled to go forward with Mexico and impose tariffs on Canada. He made a promise to the dairy farmers and he isn’t going to budge.”

Schwarzman called Kushner back a few hours later to say that he’d delivered the message that Trudeau understood it and that the prime minister had instructed his team to make a final offer according to the book.

A representative for Blackstone declined to comment. In a 2019 book of his own Schwarzman wrote that he “had the unusual opportunity to serve my country as we negotiated new trade agreements with Mexico and Canada.” He was awarded the Order of the Aztec Eagle Mexico’s highest honor for foreigners in 2018.

Officials at the Canadian prime minister’s office and at Canada’s finance ministry which Freeland now leads weren’t immediately available for comment.

Kushner writes that Enrique Pena Nieto then Mexico’s president also had a conversation with Trudeau around the same time telling him that if Canada didn’t make a deal with the US then Mexico would sign its own deal without Canada leaving the nation out of the planned successor to the 25-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement.

Pena Nieto couldn’t be immediately reached for comment.

Trudeau agreed to terms that gave US dairy farmers expanded access to Canada’s market and the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement known in America as the USMCA moved forward with all three countries preserving the highly integrated regional economy and annual trade of more than $1 trillion.

Kushner’s book describes “what happened behind closed doors during the Trump presidency” according to publisher Broadside Books. From his White House office Kushner “operated quietly behind the scenes” Broadside says. “Now Kushner finally tells his story” the publisher says covering his role in a variety of national and global issues including production of Covid-19 vaccines and Middle East peace talks.

PUBLICIDAD

In another excerpt shared with Bloomberg Kushner details how the USMCA representative of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador then Mexico’s president-elect in August 2018 made one of the worst negotiating errors that Kushner had ever seen.

At the negotiating table at the Office of the US Trade Representative in Washington Kushner began to present a US offer on the so-called sunset clause relating to the agreement’s expiration.

VIEW + Blackstone Says More Sports and Media Deals Are Coming Blackstone Group Inc. says the recent surge of investor interest in sports and media businesses is only the beginning.

The US was fighting to get Mexico and later Canada to accept the sunset clause. Neither wanted it saying it would create uncertainty for investors. The Trump administration thought that it would reduce the incentive for companies to move jobs abroad.

PUBLICIDAD

Jesus Seade who had been tapped by the Mexican leader known as AMLO who had been elected the previous month but wouldn’t take office until December interrupted with his own offer that was far more advantageous for the US -- and harmful for Mexico -- than the offer Kushner was just about to make.

Unbeknown to Seade Kushner and Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray long a top adviser to Pena Nieto had already worked together to agree on an expiration after 16 years Kushner recalls. Seade interrupted Kushner’s introduction of that deal to suggest a 12-year expiration. The potentially shorter lifespan favored US objectives at the expense of Mexico.

Kushner Videgaray and Pena Nieto’s economy minister Ildefonso Guajardo then privately constructed a fake negotiation to have Guajardo ask for 18 years so they could then arrive back at 16 years Kushner writes. Kushner and Guajardo then played out the mock negotiation in then-US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer’s office in order to get back to the agreement originally reached between Kushner and Videgaray while allowing Seade to save face according to Kushner.

“After the Mexican delegation departed Lighthizer and I looked at each other and laughed” Kushner writes. “That was one of the worst negotiating moments either of us had ever seen. ‘Just remember’ Lighthizer said ‘no one gets smarter by talking.’” Kushner writes that the exchange demonstrated the first rule of negotiation: always let the other side go first.

PUBLICIDAD

Shorter Term

Guajardo now a representative in Mexico’s lower house of congress had earnestly been seeking an 18-year expiration in the talks but needed to accept Kushner’s original 16-year proposal after Seade’s suggestion for a shorter term he said in an interview Wednesday.

Seade in a separate interview Wednesday disputed Kushner’s characterization of the negotiations saying that the proposal he offered on behalf of Lopez Obrador involved periodic reviews of the agreement linked to its expiration with the clock resetting on its expiration date with each renewal.

“The central point of the proposal I submitted representing the government-elect team from the Mexican side was to combine the extension of the deal with those reviews -- now with teeth directly linked to the extension” Seade said. The proposal was intended to “respond to the US side’s complaint about Nafta that it had been an agreement negotiated forever” he said.

“The key point I objected to and managed to successfully change was to replace the US-proposed possibility to kill the USMCA if one government so wanted at one point in time by the requirement for that government to take and sustain that decision during each of eleven consecutive years” Seade said. “This ensures for the case of the US a national consensus and solid bipartisan support.”

Seade a veteran of academia the International Monetary Fund the World Bank and the World Trade Organization went on to become a deputy foreign minister in the Lopez Obrador government and has served since last September as Mexico’s ambassador to China. Lopez Obrador last month said that he has asked Seade to help Mexico respond to a US complaint that Mexico’s nationalist energy policy violates the USMCA.

The three-year contract accepted by members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 837 had more generous retirement plan benefits than a previous contract proposal the union said in a release.

Tom Boelling president of IAM District 837 said in a release that union negotiators worked hard to get a better offer from Boeing.

“We have delivered an equitable contract that will secure the future for the members their families and future generations” Boelling said.

In an email to Defense News Boeing said it was satisfied with the resolution of the contract.

“We’re pleased with the outcome of the vote and we look forward to our future here in the St. Louis area” Boeing said.

IAW announced July 24 its members had voted to reject that previous offer largely over what it viewed as an inadequate 401(k) benefit and planned to go on strike Aug. 1 after a seven-day cooling off period.

At that time Boeing said if a strike occurred it would enact its contingency plans to keep its factories operating.

However talks resumed last week. On July 30 the union announced overnight negotiations with Boeing had yielded results and that the union’s nearly 2500 members would vote on the revised contract offer Wednesday. The start of the strike was postponed until after that vote.

The IAW said in a release the revised contract offer its members approved included an $8000 lump sum payment that can be deferred to employees’ 401(k)s.

Under the new contract Boeing will also continue making 4% automatic contributions to each employees’ 401(k) without any match from the employee the union said. The union said the rejected contract offer would have dropped the 4% automatic contribution in 2023 in favor of 2% lump sums at the end of the year for employees on the payroll on the last days of 2023 and 2024 after which those lump sums would have gone away entirely.

The ratified contract will also maintain the current 75% match for the first 8% employees contribute from their own salaries. In the contract offer rejected in late July Boeing proposed a 100% match of 10% of employee contributions.

While that would have been a more generous match the union prioritized keeping the 4% automatic contribution.

The union said the contract will also include an average 14% general wage increase over the three-year period plus cost-of-living adjustments; no changes to employees’ existing health insurance plans; improvements to sick parental and funeral leave; and other changes to the wage and raise structure.

The contract which takes effect Thursday covers members at Boeing facilities in St. Louis and St. Charles Missouri and Mascoutah Illinois. Aircraft such as the T-7A Red Hawk trainer F-15 and F/A-18 fighters and the MQ-25 Stingray unmanned refueling aircraft are built in St. Louis and St. Charles produces the precision-guided Joint Direct Attack Munition kits among other weapons.

Rendering of the UW’s Interdisciplinary Engineering Building by KieranTimberlake.

The University of Washington is breaking ground next month on its Interdisciplinary Engineering Building. The new facility should help the UW’s College of Engineering better serve its growing enrollment: since 2009 the annual number undergraduates earning degrees from the college has doubled to 1300 while the square footage of student facilities has not kept pace.

“This building is going to help us prepare more engineers. It creates a future of opportunity. It’s a pipeline of local talent” said Nancy Allbritton dean of the College of Engineering in an interview.

The $90 million building is being funded in part with a $10 million donation from Boeing. The aeronautics giant with Seattle roots made its first gift to the UW in 1917 the year after Boeing launched. That original $6000 check from founder Bill Boeing helped the UW pay for the construction of a wind tunnel.

The new gift the company said is likewise an investment in the future.

The work and research that will be done in the new facility “we see as nearly as significant to our second century as the wind tunnel was to our first century” said Bill McSherry Boeing’s vice president of state and local government operations.

Boeing has hired nearly 1200 UW engineering grads in the last five years and about 6500 UW alumni in total work for the company.

“It’s a just a natural fit for us to be lead partners in this new facility” McSherry told GeekWire.

Other funding for the project includes $50 million from the state of Washington. The remaining $30 million that’s needed will come from philanthropic giving and UW funds Allbritton said.

The new space will total 70000-square-feet across five stories and serve multiple purposes.

It will house the AI Education Institute which will help the college revamp its curriculum across disciplines to make AI and machine learning a fundamental element of the programs.

It will provide engineering education support for all 10 departments within the college which includes the William E. Boeing Department of Aeronautics & Astronautics as well as mechanical chemical and electrical engineering and other areas.

Its uses could include student advising tutoring job fairs work on capstone projects done in partnership with outside organizations and rooms for collaborative projects. The building will be centrally located on campus just east of the Husky Union Building (HUB).

The space “will be like a one-stop shop for our engineering students” Allbritton said.

The UW’s College of Engineering is spread across 30 buildings. More recent notable additions include The Bill & Melinda Gates Center for Computer Science & Engineering which opened in 2019 and the Nanoengineering and Science building that opened in 2017.

The Interdisciplinary Engineering Building’s architect is KieranTimberlake and the contractor is Hensel Phelps.

We know Boeing is struggling with its future 777X but it now appears that it has to solve a problem (or two) with its current 777 model.

Boeing’s certification progress of the new 777X is temporarily on hold. This is because the company is prioritizing the certification of the 737-10. Meanwhile the American manufacturer’s current 777 continues to sell reasonably well as a freighter. But Boeing now has to tackle a problem that is specific to the passenger versions of its current 777.

The issue doesn’t involve an essential system but its failure could create more serious problems. It has to do with a feature of the Boeing 777 called the Gust Suppression function. The role of this feature is to improve the ride of the passengers when the aircraft flies through wind gusts at low speeds.

The Source of the Boeing 777 Problem

The problem with this specific Boeing 777 system is the way it might fail in the presence of corrosion. Under certain conditions a failure could cause too much electrical resistance in the gust suppression sensor. In its airworthiness directive the FAA is requiring the operators of these aircraft to disconnect this system.

The airlines must do this within three months or before the aircraft has flown 75000 flight hours. According to the FAA there are 279 Boeing 777 widebodies that could potentially have this problem. But this is only the number of affected 777s with US registrations. Other regulators around the world will need to release similar airworthiness directives for the airliners in their registries.

We don’t know the number of those foreign aircraft. Thankfully it appears that disconnecting the system is relatively straightforward. Engineers must disconnect connectors to the system in question then cap these connectors and secure the wires. Meanwhile according to the FAA Boeing is working on a modification that will be a longer-term solution to this issue with its 777 fleet.

Some Better News for Boeing

When this Boeing solution comes the FAA will have to approve it replacing this airworthiness directive with a new one. But recently the FAA proposed an airworthiness directive that would address another potential problem with the Boeing 777. This has to do with securing fuel tanks from a potential electric discharge under certain conditions.

On the plus side for Boeing the FAA chief is now preparing to meet with the agency’s own inspectors to discuss new deliveries of the 787. As we’ve seen Boeing stopped deliveries of this aircraft over a year ago. This story confirms that there is progress on this matter as we saw last week. If all goes well Boeing could restart deliveries of its Dreamliners in August.

The FAA’s approach with the 787 and its response to the latest 777 problem are indicative of its changed relationship with Boeing.

The auto supplier says the deal will accelerate its charging business by leveraging its existing capabilities.

BorgWarner is best known for making and selling quality parts to OEMs. For example some of the suppliers’ largest customers include legacy automakers like Ford GM and Volkswagen.

The company operates worldwide with a presence in all major markets; that said BorgWarner has been growing at a steady rate for the past decade yet the company is looking to accelerate its growth by moving to support the auto industry’s transition to EVs.

According to recent forecasts plug-in vehicle sales will make up almost a quarter of new passenger vehicle sales by 2025 up from 10% this past year.

Over the past few years BorgWarner has made several acquisitions to boost its ability to support EV demand.

In May 2019 BorgWarner invested in Romeo Power a leading battery tech company founded by Tesla and SpaceX engineers.

Then in September 2019 BorgWarner and Romeo formed a joint venture BorgWarner Romeo Power. But in February 2022 BorgWarner sold its stake and no longer has any interest.

On August 2 2021 the company squeezed out shareholders for 100% interest in AKASOL a german EV battery company.

On March 31 2022 BorgWarner acquired 100% of Santroll Automotive Components a light vehicle eMotor business.

As you can see BorgWarner is transitioning along with the rest of the auto industry to support EVs. The auto supplier has won multiple awards for its EV products such as high voltage coolant heaters commercial battery systems and fast charging stations.

But the company expects its latest deal to fuel its growth in the EV industry.

BorgWarner is buying Rhombus Energy Solutions to drive EV charging growth

To complement its existing EV charging business BorgWarner is buying Rhombus Energy Solutions. The deal will boost its EV charging presence in North America while adding to its European market.

Rhombus’s headquarters is in San Diego CA and its primary markets include electric buses and trucks. A few of its largest customers include Proterra (electric buses & EV charging) and Nuuve (EV charging and grid solutions).

The deal can be worth up to $185 million but BorgWarner expects it to add value sooner rather than later. For example there is a massive push for a national EV charging network to boost accessibility and promote EV buying.

BorgWarner expects the deal to add significant value to the business with estimated revenue between $175 to $200 million by 2025.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vYmlsaXR5b3V0bG9vay5jb20vbmV3cy9ib3Jnd2FybmVyLW1ha2VzLXNlcmllcy1vZi1hbm5vdW5jZW1lbnRzLWluLWV2LXNwYWNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BorgWarner Makes Series Of Announcements In EV Space,"Leading mobility solution provider BorgWarner announced that it has been awarded business by a couple of the global automakers to provide its 800V High-Voltage Coolant Heater (HVCH) and 400V coolant heater technology for their new electric vehicle models.

According to a press release from the company that the new electric vehicle models equipped with the technology are scheduled to start production by the end of 2023 and early 2024.

The coolant heaters feature a compact modular design with reduced packaging size and weight. By offering consistent temperature distribution inside the battery pack and its cells these heaters can be used to improve battery energy performance in EVs and HEVs.

Additionally the HVCH uses the latest thick film element (TFE) technology which delivers great flexibility in terms of the dimension and size of the heating elements.

Suitable for applications with supply voltages between 250 and 800 volts the HVCH offers a power range of 3kW to 10 kW it added.

Akasol Finds Way To European e-CV Makers

In another update the company noted that a European manufacturer has selected its Akasol ultra-high energy battery system to power its first range of heavy-duty electric trucks.

The series production of the 4x2 rigid axle 18-tonne truck and 6x2 rigid 26-tonne truck is scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2024. Developed for energy-intensive electric drivetrain applications operating at up to 747 volts each 9AKM battery pack stores 98 kWh of energy and comes ready to install with all connectors and has a claimed estimated life expectancy of up to 4000 cycles. It added that the battery packs are supplied along with the company’s Multi String Manager (MSM+) serving as a single communication interface to the vehicle control unit and reducing the need for software development by the customer.

Strengthen EV Business

Additionally to increase its share in the EV industry BorgWarner also acquired Rhombus Energy Solutions. The transaction has an enterprise value of up to $185 million and was funded primarily with cash balances.

It added that approximately $130 million was delivered at closing and up to $55 million could be paid in the form of contingent payments over the next three years.

The acquisition also supports its Charging Forward strategy and strengthens the electric vehicle positioning as the company aims to power the entire propulsion system from the grid to the wheels.

Headquartered in San Diego California Rhombus offers V2G and Underwriters Laboratory-certified charging. Rhombus supplies its patented technology to EV OEMs including Proterra and charging and grid service providers.

Charging Stations In Italy

The company noted that the first units of its new fast-charging station Iperion-120 have been installed by the Italian service provider Route220 and are ready to support drivers of electric vehicles on their journeys in Italy. The direct current (DC) device offers benefits for users and operators alike through its fast-charging options easy-to-use operations compatibility versatility and longevity.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL2F1dG8uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2F1dG8tY29tcG9uZW50cy9hdXRvLXN1cHBsaWVyLWFwdGl2LWN1dHMtZm9yZWNhc3Qtb24tZXVyb3BlLWdhcy1zdXBwbHktd29ycmllcy85MzM2OTkwMtIBigFodHRwczovL2F1dG8uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9hdXRvLWNvbXBvbmVudHMvYXV0by1zdXBwbGllci1hcHRpdi1jdXRzLWZvcmVjYXN0LW9uLWV1cm9wZS1nYXMtc3VwcGx5LXdvcnJpZXMvOTMzNjk5MDI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Auto supplier Aptiv cuts forecast on Europe gas supply worries,"Advt

Burlington MA HBC Properties and Investments (HBCPI) and Streetworks Development the in-house real estate development arm of HBC plans to convert a three-property 360000 s/f retail portfolio in the greater Boston metropolitan area to life science facilities.

Each of the three sites – located in Burlington Natick and Braintree – are within walking distance to lifestyle and shopping centers. The spaces will be repurposed to serve as research and development facilities suited for a wide variety of life sciences and office uses.

Demand for highly amenitized suburban offices in Boston continues to surge post-pandemic as companies seek accommodations that meet employees’ needs in the current climate. While new supply pipelines in Boston’s life science market have increased these past few years those deliveries will not eclipse demand for some time and many of the suburban markets do not have walkable urban amenities available to them. HBCPI’s plan to adapt these spaces for immediate use is further proof of the firm’s development savvy and ability to repurpose valuable real estate for uses that create social and economic value in their respective communities.

Rendering of 250 Granite Street - Braintree MA

Located at 1320 Burlington Mall Rd. in Burlington 1245 Worcester St. in Natick and 250 Granite St. in Braintree each of the three locations will consist of 120000 s/f of office and communal space. Likewise these buildings are positioned directly adjacent to retail complexes that offer access to a litany of lifestyle amenities including high-end retail dining and hospitality options within walking distance – extending the benefits historically associated with class A office space to these life science properties. The portfolio also provides access to major transportation arteries for an optimal commuting experience.

SGA is the lead architecture and design firm consulting on the project. Leasing for the portfolio is being facilitated by Cushman & Wakefield whose data has indicated a robust delivery pipeline of life science assets in Boston that will exceed 3.9 million s/f in 2023 which will be bolstered by persistent demand and high rates of investment in the market.

“Since the onset of the pandemic life science properties have emerged as some of the most vibrant high-performing assets on the market. However as the pandemic subsides life science developments will need to reorient themselves to provide their tenants with an elevated level of convenience and community to stand out.” said John Boyle Executive Vice Chairman of Cushman & Wakefield. “HBC’s vision for this portfolio will provide an utterly unique opportunity to connect top life science companies with the unmatched talent pool in Boston’s suburbs while providing a level of amenity access unheard of in the suburban life science sector.”

1320 Burlington Mall Road - Burlington MA

Recognizing the market’s broad appetite for quality life science space HBCPI and Streetworks are currently working with respective municipal officials through rezoning and entitlement proceedings to rapidly bring these research facilities to market a process which will be expedited due to the structural qualities of the existing properties which feature extensive space large floor plates and high ceilings — all of which are hallmarks of life science developments. The company anticipates receiving approvals in Q3 and beginning renovations in Q3 2022.

“We’re very excited to move forward with this life science conversion in Boston which enables us to tap into the region’s rich history of innovation while maximizing the true value of these assets” said Ken Narva Chairman and Chief Development Officer of Streetworks Development. “We look forward to leveraging our decades of development and placemaking experience to create first-class facilities that combine the very best in research and lab space while also offering tenants and their employees’ access to some of the Boston metropolitan area’s finest retail destinations and lifestyle amenities.”

“Boston has long been one of the country’s most dynamic life science real estate markets and demand for new product continues to outpace supply” said Jerrold Bermingham senior vice president at HBCPI. “HBCPI and Streetworks Development will work in tandem with a team of consultants architects designers and engineers to ensure a smooth conversion strategy that achieves the highest and best use of these properties. Likewise this is the perfect opportunity to demonstrate a new approach to life science development that connects the traditionally isolated workforce within these buildings to the broader community — a model which we believe will ultimately reinforce Boston’s primacy in the life science market.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL25ldy15b3JrLzIwMjIvMDgvMDQvd2FudC10by1qb2luLXNhZnJhcy1wcml2YXRlLWNsdWItYXQtZ20tYnVpbGRpbmctaXRsbC1jb3N0LXlvdS0xMjVrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Safra Offers Private Club at GM Building with $125K Price Tag,"If WeWork isn’t luxurious enough Edmond Safra has an alternative.

Safra and restaurateur Juan Santa Cruz are taking the 37th floor of Boston Properties’ GM Building for its private club known as Colette. Bloomberg reported the club will open in March as a co-working space for the rich.

The hedge funder has an ownership stake in the GM Building likely a big help for securing the space.

Those wanting the luxury office space better be ready to pay big money. Shares in the club will cost $125000 though members can resell their shares when they please. On top of that initial cost yearly dues will cost $36000 per year. Members will be paying for both luxury and exclusivity as membership is capped at 300.

For comparison the Core Club is opening four blocks south of Colette with initiation fees between $15000 and $100000 and annual dues between $15000 and $18000.

The club will have 23 private offices measuring roughly 400 square feet each and will include desks a seating area a videoconference hookup and temperature/light control. The floor will also include conference rooms and a members lounge.

One of the perks of the club will be a dedicated staff to bring members snacks and coffee as well as provide administrative support such as making copies or bringing guests to meetings.

Club members will have access to the building’s fitness center and canteen as well as a restaurant billed by Santa Cruz as an “Omakase concept.” The restaurant will have its own membership base and lower costs but Colette members have an automatic in.

Other competitors in the co-working luxury field include Ned’s Club in the NoMad Hotel Casa Cipriani at South Street Seaport Soho House and Ludlow House. Aman is also set to open its own club between Colette and Core though it is geared more towards lifestyle than working.

Santa Cruz told the outlet the design of the space is what will separate it from its competition putting a particular focus on features that have become more important since the onset of the pandemic.

Last month Anderson who had spent the previous five years handling apartment transactions across Tennessee decided to see for himself. He moved over to Cushman & Wakefield's Nashville office where he's now a director who works on apartment investment sales in the city and across the eastern portion of Tennessee as part of the firm's Sun Belt multifamily sales group.

Cushman & Wakefield's track record of multifamily transactions in the region attracted him to the Chicago-based firm Anderson said.

In 2021 Cushman & Wakefield's Sunbelt Multifamily Advisory Group closed 429 deals with an aggregate value of $13.8 billion that involved the trading of nearly 85000 units. The sales volume and transaction number ranked No. 1 in the Sun Belt region Cushman & Wakefield said based on deals reported to CoStar Group.

While headwinds have started to gain strength mostly caused by increasing interest rates Anderson said he still sees ample runway ahead for multifamily sales in Nashville.

""With the amount of development activity in the market many properties will deliver over the next several quarters which should bolster transactions"" Anderson said in an email. ""Continued interest from a growing list of investors is as strong as ever.""

From April through June multifamily sales in the Nashville area hit a quarterly record. Anderson played a role in one of Nashville's largest apartment sales of the second quarter: While at JLL he was part of the team that represented Westplan Investors in its $77.64 million sale of Accent Edgewood which has been renamed Braxton Music City.

However the Federal Reserve's moves to raise interest rates by 75 basis points twice in the past two months have increased its benchmark rate to 2.25% to 2.5%. That is expected to affect sales of commercial properties across the country and globe and Anderson is monitoring the central bank's actions.

""The greatest challenge we are seeing right now resides in the debt markets"" he said. ""The recent increase in rates will affect the price point at which investors are willing to transact.""

A Nashville native Anderson said commercial real estate had intrigued him so it was a natural career choice.

""It allows me to work with clients from all over"" he said. ""I get to share my perspective on this great city and learn the fundamentals of investing.""

While global institutional investors are starting to take note of the Nashville market it still has work to do before claiming top-tier status Anderson said.

""With the amount of attention and publicity Nashville has gained over the past decade we are still far from being a gateway city"" he said. ""I see that as a positive. I’m optimistic about the long runway Nashville holds.""

The property situated along the city’s First Street corridor facing Canal Park and the Charles River in the East Cambridge neighborhood is located adjacent to CambridgeSide — an enclosed regional mall that is being redeveloped to include 650000 square feet of office life sciences and residential space — and the 4.5 million-square-foot Cambridge Crossing innovation hub.

Breakthrough acquired the four-story building last year and is updating it to feature 105000 square feet of high-quality research and development space. The property will feature a ground-floor lounge private outdoor gathering spaces concierge fitness center on-site retail and adjacent parking.

A timeline for the redevelopment — which is targeting Fitwel WELL and LEED Gold certifications — was not announced.

A flurry of life sciences development is underway in the Boston metropolitan area. Recently announced projects include Phase I of Assembly Innovation Park a life sciences tower spanning 485000 square feet in the Boston suburb of Somerville; and Allston LabWorks a 580905-square-foot life sciences retail and multifamily project in the Allston neighborhood of Boston. Financing for both projects made headlines earlier this week.

East Cambridge in particular has a life sciences vacancy rate around just 1 percent according to Breakthrough. Both Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are within two miles of the One Canal project.

Breakthrough Properties announced earlier this year that it had raised $3 billion in direct capital and co-investments to scale a global portfolio of life sciences properties. The joint venture was founded in 2019 and currently has a pipeline of 4.6 million square feet in development underway.

Projects are located in Boston; San Diego; Philadelphia; Amsterdam Netherlands; Oxford U.K.; and Cambridge Mass. In Boston the company recently delivered The 105 by Breakthrough at 105 West First St. which will serve as CRISPR Therapeutics’ U.S. facility.

In return Boston Scientific will also grant Nevro a worldwide non-exclusive non-transferable licence under Boston Scientific’s asserted patent families and a covenant not to sue.

Under the settlement Boston Scientific will pay Nevro $85 million. However a US court awarded Boston Scientific $20 million in damages in 2021 because Nevro infringed two of its competitor’s patents.

Boston Scientific offers its technology as part of its “Precision” system Nevro competes with its “Senza” system. The devices relieve chronic pain. The treatment involves stimulating the spinal cord with high frequencies. The companies emphasise the advantage of the treatment is that it does not cause sensory disturbances in patients.

According to Reuters Boston Scientific made $909 million last year from neuromodulation products including its Precision line. Meanwhile Nevro made more than $386 million from its products. The news agency cites filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

Intensive litigation in the US and Europe

The settlement also puts an end to all legal disputes between Nevro and Boston Scientific. The two competitors have been suing each other over patents in the US since 2016.

In 2018 the dispute then spilled over into Germany. Boston Scientific filed an entitlement action (case ID: 7 O 14659/18) with the Munich Regional Court.

According to JUVE Patent information the case is said to have concerned the surrender of around 30 European patents from Nevro to Boston Scientific. Munich Regional Court initially rejected this. Eventually the dispute landed at the Higher Regional Court was referred back to the Regional Court and then returned to the second instance (case ID: 6 U 1771/22). Munich Higher Regional Court had not issued a ruling at the time of the settlement.

It is not known why Boston Scientific demanded the transfer of the property rights in Europe. According to press reports however the company claimed in the US proceedings “that Nevro has hired away dozens of former Boston Scientific employees since its earliest days as a company to steal its trade secrets”.

The two companies also recently faced off before the European Patent Office attacking each other’s patents in EPO oppositions. There were no lawsuits in other European countries.

New client Nevro for Bird & Bird

According to JUVE Patent information the dispute with Boston Scientific was the first time Bird & Bird had acted for Nevro in court. The team led by Düsseldorf partner Oliver Jüngst is known in the market primarily for pharmaceutical cases. It is currently representing CureVac against BioNTech in the first lawsuit concerning a Covid 19 vaccine in Germany.

Nevertheless Bird & Bird’s patent team is no stranger to the medical technology sector. Munich partner Boris Kreye for example is intensively litigating for Edwards Lifesciences against Meril in a heart valve dispute.

Boston Scientific and Vossius & Partner on the other hand have a long-standing relationship. The patent attorneys file patents with the EPO extensively. The litigation team is currently conducting further proceedings against Cook Medical in Germany. However the medical device manufacturer has also retained other law firms for patent litigation in the past.

Vossius team well versed

Overall the Vossius litigation team is very active in medical-device litigation. ResMed for example is another major client the team regularly litigates for such as in an extensive series of lawsuits against Fisher & Paykel. This ended in a settlement in 2019. Then as now the Vossius team led by Thure Schubert faced the Bird & Bird team led by Oliver Jüngst.

According to JUVE Patent information the US proceedings for Boston Scientific were led by the law firms Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld and Arnold Porter Kaye Scholer. On the opposing side Sidley Austin Sterne Kessler Goldstein & Fox and Morris Nichols Arsht & Tunnell were active for Nevro.

David Ludwig MD PhD argues that it’s what we eat not how many calories we take in that leads to obesity. (Images: AdobeStock Illustration: Sebastian Stankiewicz/Boston Children’s Hospital).

David S. Ludwig MD PhD co-directs the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center at Boston Children’s Hospital.

Because conventional thinking usually rests on years (sometimes centuries) of research scientists are naturally skeptical of radical new ideas. But occasionally problems with normal science arise such as a persistent failure to solve important puzzles and anomalies that can’t be easily explained away. Science may then enter what the famous philosopher Thomas Kuhn called a “crisis” when competing paradigms emerge to clash with the old ones.

Writing in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition my coauthors and I argue that the field of obesity research is entering a crisis. To stem the rising tide of obesity-related disease we must embrace not resist paradigm clash.

When calorie restriction keeps failing — and rates of obesity keep going up — we need to test new approaches.

For the past century thinking about obesity has been based on the notion of energy balance comparing the number of calories we consume to those that we burn. Surrounded by delicious energy-dense foods the surplus calories we take in are deposited into body fat and we gain weight. In other words overeating causes obesity.

In this view the body treats all calories the same so the only way to lose weight is to reduce our calorie intake or exercise more to burn calories off. This notion is behind the last century’s calorie-counting and later low-fat diets targeting the most calorie-dense nutrient.

But consider this paradox. Since 2000 calorie consumption in the U.S. has plateaued or decreased according to an analysis by Dariush Mozaffarian MD DrPH of Tufts University. Americans have also become somewhat more physically active. Yet obesity rates have risen by more than a third to almost half of the U.S. population.

Another puzzle is why the so-called “body weight set-point” has risen so much among genetically stable populations. In 1960 an average man in the U.S. was able to maintain a weight of about 165 pounds without constant dieting. Today that average man weighs about 195 pounds.

The carbohydrate-insulin model

A competing paradigm also dating back a century argues that we’ve reversed cause and effect. Overeating isn’t the primary cause of obesity. Rather the process of gaining weight causes us to overeat.

Consider the adolescent growth spurt. During their most rapid stages of growth teens may increase food intake by hundreds of calories a day. But does this “overeating” cause the growth spurt? Or does the growth spurt itself with rapid storage of those extra calories in new body tissues cause the adolescent to get hungry and eat more?

Our recently proposed carbohydrate-insulin model helps explain this phenomenon. It focuses on the processed quickly digested carbs — think white bread white rice sugary breakfast cereals and potato products — that flooded our diet during the low-fat diet craze. These carbs cause a spike in blood sugar raise insulin levels too high and induce other hormonal changes that tell our body to store the calories as fat.

This model of obesity sees the real problem as one of calorie distribution. Too many calories are being sequestered in fat tissue and too few remain in the blood to satisfy our energy needs. Sensing starvation our brain sends hunger signals to prompt us to eat. In other words overeating is a symptom of a poor diet.

Coaxing fat out

Instead of cutting back calories which merely prompts body metabolism to slow down and sets the stage for weight regain weight-loss efforts should focus on reducing the surge of blood glucose and insulin after meals. That can be accomplished with a higher-fat diet low in processed carbs. (Slow-digesting “low glycemic load” carbs like whole fruits non-starchy vegetables beans and minimally processed grains don’t cause such large glucose and insulin surges.)

Without the hormonal signals driving us to store excessive calories fat tissue can be coaxed to release calories into the blood reducing hunger and supporting metabolism. This way you can lose weight without restricting calories and are more likely to succeed long term.

Does this mean the carbohydrate-insulin model should replace the energy-balance paradigm? Unfortunately the research needed to provide a definitive answer has never been done. The National Institutes of Health has invested in many major low-fat diet trials all failing to show any benefit for the main outcomes. But the agency has yet to fund a major long-term low-carb trial.

In papers we published in 2018 and 2021 in addition to our new paper we have aimed to build the carbohydrate-insulin model from the available scientific evidence. Yet critics claim to have disproven the model based on weak evidence such as small trials lasting two weeks or less.

Energy balance bias

One reason energy balance thinking still dominates may be cultural. Obesity has long been blamed on a weakness of character and a lack of self-control. Despite decades of research into the genetic and biological influences on body weight obesity is still surrounded by stigma unlike almost any other chronic disease. Even healthcare professionals may harbor this bias.

But when calorie restriction keeps failing — and rates of obesity keep going up — we need to test new approaches. It may even be possible for competing paradigms to combine providing deeper insights than from either alone. Given that the costs of type 2 diabetes just one weight-related complication are almost $1 billion a day we can’t afford to dismiss new thinking on obesity’s causes.

Rod Patch senior director packaging engineering & product labeling at Johnson & Johnson Vision called Jordan Montgomery distinguished packaging engineer at Medtronic and asked him how many stability studies his company was failing. The answer was none. Patch contacted other colleagues and their answers were as unwavering as the results of their stability studies: The tests never failed begging the question: Why do we keep repeating them?

Patch and his colleagues felt there had to be a way to prove the inherent stability of certain packaging materials thereby forgoing redundant stability testing activities. This idea led to the genesis of Wicked Stability a project funded by Kilmer Innovations in Packaging (KiiP) to design a new less burdensome method of predicting stability for sterile barrier systems.

Something wicked this way comes.

The term “wicked stability” is new to the industry. To some medical industry packaging professionals “wicked” is an adjective that has special meaning. A couple of years ago Laura Bix Ph.D. Assistant Dean of Teaching Learning and Academic Analytics at the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources and a Professor at the School of Packaging at Michigan State University gave a presentation on medical packaging that emotionally connected with that audience (referred to as the “unicorn” speech). She used “wicked” to describe a current vexing issue. A group of attendees at that session have picked up this term as a nod to Bix’s insight leadership and inspiration in packaging and use it to describe other issues challenging medical packaging professionals.

At the[PACK]out conference session “Wicked Stability: Re-imaging Stability” Patch and fellow Wicked Stability team members Dan Burgess Fellow Packaging Engineer at Boston Scientific and Henk Blom Ph.D. VP of Research and Technology at PAXXUS discussed the wicked problem the science of material stability and how oxidative induction time (OIT) can help to assess the level of stability in a material.

In pursuit of a common threshold that would allow testing to start at some other test point than zero the team discussed the possibility of creating an open-source database of sterile barrier packaging systems. DuPont’s Medical Packaging Transition Project (MPTP) — in Patch’s words the largest treasure chest of information ever created in our space — was an obvious choice but MPTP’s three-way non-disclosure agreement proved challenging to get around.

“There’s resistance hesitation reluctance to unlock that data and release it to the world” he said. “And unfortunately at this time we’re still in negotiation; we’re still trying to get access to that information.”

“We’re still in negotiation; we’re still trying to get access to … the largest treasure chest of information ever created” on sterile barrier systems. Rod Patch Senior Director Packaging Engineering & Product Labeling Johnson & Johnson Vision

Although the team hasn’t given up on the idea of creating a shared database of information it is focusing its efforts on finding other tools to predict stability.

Understanding the science.

Following Patch’s opening Blom took to the podium to explain the degradation process using a common material; low-density polyethylene (LDPE). To stop the degradation process manufacturers formulate resins with antioxidants to maintain the stability of the polymer chain. Over the lifecycle of a resin pellet that antioxidant concentration slowly decreases as the resin undergoes various processes including extrusion lamination heat sealing and sterilization.

“The critical thing is we have residual antioxidant and it is protecting the material” Blom said leading up to the team’s wicked hypothesis: “As long as antioxidant is still in the material it is protecting that material. And we shouldn’t see any functionally important degradation while antioxidant is in the material.”

Next Blom walked attendees through two methods used to measure antioxidant concentrations: a direct method called HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography) and an indirect method called OIT (oxidative induction time) used to assess the level of stabilization in the material being tested. The latter is the Wicked Stability team’s method of choice for validating material stability. According to Blom the team is still working on figuring out the variability of the method. But an ASTM test method for OIT already exists: D3895-19.

And whether or not their work develops into a standard or a published paper remains to be seen.

“We’re still working through that process” Burgess told attendees. “But we want to have a data-driven and science-based approach that we can share with everybody so that this tool or set of tools can be used by others in the future to expand on the work.”

“We want to have a data-driven and science-based approach that we can share with everybody.” Dan Burgess Fellow Packaging Engineer at Boston Scientific

Collaboration is key.

Throughout the session Patch Blom and Burgess appealed to the audience for their input and guidance.

“One of the things we need from you is to tell us where the holes are in the approach that we’re thinking about” Blom said.

“One of the things we need from you is to tell us where the holes are in the approach that we’re thinking about.” Henk Blom Ph.D. VP of Research and Technology at PAXXUS

Burgess encouraged the audience to take advantage of opportunities such as KiiP Institute of Packaging Professionals (IoPP) and standards organizations to collaborate with others and make improvements in the industry. He emphasized that by working together as a team they can move this project forward in a much shorter time than they could have done working alone.

“If we all collaborated we could maybe come up with a different way to approach this stuff and then we could spend more time on things that we should be focused on: true innovation differentiating products that type of stuff” Burgess said. “These things like we’re talking about here where we just keep checking the box let’s do less of that and let’s do more of the things that are really improving patient safety patient lives and getting people excited about their work.”

Median overall survival (OS) significantly improved from 11.5 months with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor to 17.8 months with lenvatinib plus TACE (HR 0.45 95% CI 0.33-0.61 P<0.001) reported Ming Kuang MD PhD of Sun Yat Sen University in Guangzhou China and colleagues.

In addition median progression-free survival (PFS) grew from 6.4 months to 10.6 months respectively (HR 0.43 95% CI 0.34-0.55) according to findings published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.

In the TACE group no survival difference was observed for patients receiving drug-eluting lenvatinib beads compared with conventional lenvatinib.

Benefit with the combination was seen across most subgroups and the results suggest TACE-lenvatinib could be ""a potential first-line treatment for patients with advanced HCC"" Kuang and colleagues concluded.

But the results ""do not change the standard of care in the United States"" said Anthony B. El-Khoueiry MD of the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center in Los Angeles discussing the findings when they were first presented at this year's Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium. Still he called the results ""intriguing"" and said that LAUNCH ""reinforces the feasibility of combined liver-directed and systemic therapy.""

The study had several limitations he noted such as its younger population (median 54-56 years) and the high percentage of patients with hepatitis B (86-87%) which limits its broad applicability. Furthermore he pointed out that the OS in the lenvatinib monotherapy arm underperformed compared with phase III trials involving sorafenib (Nexavar) and that the systemic therapy backbone used in the study is not the current standard of care.

LAUNCH was a randomized open-label phase III trial conducted from June 2019 to July 2021 at 12 hospitals across China. Overall 338 patients with primary treatment-naive or initial recurrent advanced HCC after surgery were assigned 1:1 to receive lenvatinib plus on-demand TACE or lenvatinib monotherapy.

After a median follow-up of 17 months 44.1% of patients in the lenvatinib-TACE group had died versus 61.9% of those in the lenvatinib group.

In general the two groups had balanced baseline characteristics.

In addition to the survival outcomes described above the overall response rates were 45.9% in the lenvatinib-TACE group and 20.8% in the lenvatinib group according to RECIST 1.1 (P<0.001).

Multivariable analyses identified portal vein tumor thrombus (HR 2.04) and treatment allocation (HR 0.41) as independent risk factors for both OS and PFS (HR 1.90 and HR 0.38 respectively; P<0.001 for all).

As for safety grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) were more common in the lenvatinib-TACE group with significantly higher AEs including alanine transaminase elevations (17.6% vs 1.2% with lenvatinib alone) aspartate aminotransferase elevations (22.9% vs 1.8%) and hyperbilirubinemia (9.4% vs 3.0%). Dose reductions for AEs occurred in 52.9% of patients assigned lenvatinib-TACE and 44.6% of those on lenvatinib alone.

This fundraiser is Noah Pickelhaupt’s Eagle Scout project.

The breakfast will be held from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday at Builders Firstsource parking lot 1441 M-32 Alpena. The event will be held rain or shine with drive-thru or sit-down options available.

Pickelhaupt is a member of Scout Troop 92 at St. Paul Lutheran Church in Alpena. He will be a sophomore at Hillman High School this year. His parents are David and Jennifer Pickelhaupt.

“(HSA) just sounded like a really good organization to raise money for” he said.

August 4 2022) - Prince William County has begun receiving settlement distributions from nationwide settlements with three pharmaceutical distributors and an opioid manufacturer that helped to fuel the opioid epidemic. In all Virginia and its localities will receive approximately $530 million over a period of years in the settlements with the drug distributors McKesson Corp. AmerisourceBergen Corp. and Cardinal Health and the prescription opioid manufacturer Janssen Pharmaceutical. On August 1 Prince William County received notification that the National Opioid Settlement Directing Administrator initiated a Distributor payment of $144599.40 to the County for Payment Year 1.

These settlements resulted in part from the efforts of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors who first filed suit against these defendants several years ago.

Virginia has been a national leader in creating a transparent and orderly process for deploying its opioid settlement funds. Last year the Office of the Virginia Attorney General successfully partnered with each of the Commonwealth’s 133 cities and counties to reach 100% agreement in support of a structured program for distributing opioid settlement funds.

“The opioid epidemic has affected families and communities throughout the Commonwealth including here in Prince William County” remarks Chair Ann B. Wheeler. “Although this settlement cannot adequately compensate for those who have died from opioid overdose deaths we hope our efforts to invest the funds to combat the opioid crisis will be a small comfort to their loved ones.”

""Our community’s first responders and government departments including Police Fire and Rescue and Community Services are setting the groundwork to provide critical lifesaving support education and resources to address the opioid epidemic” says Gainesville District Supervisor Pete Candland who first proposed that the County become involved in the suit. “The funding provided by this settlement will help enhance services to more county residents.”

Under the terms of the agreement between the state and its local jurisdictions:

Fifteen percent of settlement funds will be allocated to the Commonwealth of Virginia.

Thirty percent of settlement funds will be allocated to Virginia’s cities and counties and at least half of the funds must be spent on community-based opioid abuse prevention treatment and recovery efforts.

Each locality’s allocation is based on specific local metrics including the number of opioid-related ER visits and overdose deaths and the volume of opioid prescription drugs shipped into each locality.

The remaining 55% of settlement funds will be administered by the new Opioid Abatement Authority established in law by the 2021 Virginia General Assembly to provide additional and ongoing support for local regional and state opioid abuse abatement efforts.

According to the Virginia Department of Health 14541 Virginians died from opioid-related overdoses between 2007 and 2021. In 2020 1478 Virginians died from fatal opioid overdoses – a 17% increase over 2019 and an average of four fatal overdoses per day. Nearly 10000 people were treated for opioid-related overdoses in Virginia hospital emergency rooms in 2020 – a 33% increase over the prior year.

Additional legal activities related to the opioid epidemic are still underway including Virginia’s pending $80 million settlement with OxyContin manufacturer Purdue Pharma and its founders the Sackler family. Going forward local regional and state opioid abatement efforts are expected to be further supplemented by additional settlements verdicts or court orders involving others who participated in the manufacture marketing distribution and sale of opioids in Virginia.

The foundation was created following the recent sale of Johnston Memorial Healthcare Foundation’s minority ownership stake in Johnston Memorial Hospital to Ballad Health. (See background story on the rise of similar hospital conversion foundations around Southwest and Southside.)

Wellspring’s funding of $500000 for the expansion of AHCDC’s clinic was awarded to the organization in a presentation ceremony in Abingdon. In addition to Wellspring’s support the Virginia Health Care Foundation (VHCF) donated $100000 and Jan Hurt of Abingdon provided $50000.

AHCDC provides oral healthcare to underserved and uninsured individuals and families in 11 counties throughout Southwest Virginia. Sixty percent of the clinic’s patients reside in Wellspring’s service footprint of Washington Grayson Russell and Smyth counties.

Funding from the Wellspring Foundation will allow AHCDC to acquire much-needed additional equipment and begin construction to expand its existing facility this fall. Once construction is completed in 2023 the clinic will be positioned to bring in additional dental residents and serve more patients throughout the region.

Sean McMurray executive director of the Wellspring Foundation of Southwest Virginia noted that the regional need for the kind of services AHCDC provides is consistently high.

“The ratio of dentists per person in our region is 32 per 100000 residents” McMurray said in a statement. “That’s approximately half of the available resources in other areas of the Commonwealth.”

AHCDC is the principal training site for Johnston Memorial Hospital’s Advanced Education in General Dentistry (AEGD) residency program which provides a 12-month hands-on experience to recent dental school graduates. The program which is accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA) accepted its first dental resident in 2020. Residents gain clinical expertise and academic training while providing dental care to uninsured Southwest Virginians.

The expansion represents the first phase of increasing access for patients and boosting the services offered by AHCDC. In 2021 AHCDC served 3645 patients equating to a savings of nearly $2.5 million. By 2026 the clinic plans to treat 10000 patients annually with an estimated cost savings to patients of $6.5 million.

“We currently have five residents who collectively see approximately 20 patients per day” Miller said in a statement. “After completion of this first construction phase we will have seven residents next July and eventually welcome nine residents enabling us to more than double the number of patients that we can treat. There is a three- to four-month waiting list to be considered a new patient and a four-month waiting list for new patients to receive services. We maintain a waiting list of more than 200 patients at any time and we receive 50 calls per day for assistance. Expansion of the dental center is paramount to meet the demand for quality and affordable dental care in the communities we serve and this expansion will continue to ensure that patients of Southwest Virginia have access to the best dental care in the Commonwealth.”

It Was Hard.,"Activist and entertainer Jon Stewart hugs fellow advocate Susan Zeier of Sandusky Ohio just after Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer D-N.Y. assured veterans and military family members that the Senate will vote on a bill designed to help millions of veterans exposed to toxic substances during their military service at the Capitol in Washington Tuesday Aug. 2 2022. All but 11 lawmakers voted to pass the bill this week. N.C.'s Thom Tillis voted against. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)

In a state with more than 13000 veterans that have been exposed to toxic burn pits Tillis voted against a bill that he theoretically supports.

North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis said himself that he wrote a significant portion of the PACT Act. Still Tillis was one of just 11 senators all of them Republicans to maintain their opposition this week.

The bipartisan federal legislation addresses the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs’ ability to provide healthcare for military service members exposed to toxins and represents the biggest expansion in available healthcare to the military in decades.

It matters in North Carolina a state with several major armed forces bases a broad population of veterans and as of last year more than 13000 North Carolinians had registered as being exposed to airborne toxins and burn pits in the line of duty. That’s 5th most among the states.

By all accounts Tillis should have been in favor of the bill. He’s been a lead proponent to provide direct benefits to those exposed to water contamination at North Carolina’s Camp Lejeune. And he’s also worked on a broader bill to address toxins and military exposure called the TEAM Act which was also included in the bill.

So why was he one of just 11 senators to vote against it earlier this week? Fellow North Carolina Republican Sen. Richard Burr voted for the bill’s final passage.

Tillis said in a statement and video on his website that it wasn’t “what we’re doing it’s how we’re doing it.” He added:

“While well-intentioned the PACT Act creates new promises to veterans while breaking existing ones which is why I could not support its passage. I recently listened to [Veterans Affairs] Secretary McDonough describe the challenges the VA is facing in meeting current obligations and it’s clear that the Department does not have the capacity to properly implement the PACT Act. This legislation will have adverse operational and administrative impacts and I remain concerned that it will result in increased wait times delays in receiving care and a substantial increase in the claims backlog. I fully expect that in the coming years Congress will be forced to make substantial changes to account for these unintended consequences.”

Here’s the problem: While voting against the bill Tillis could have called for increased funding for the VA to better help service members — something Congress expressly has the responsibility to do. Instead he voted against a bill he says he stands for.

It’s true that the VA faces a backlog of disability claims and the PACT Act will no doubt complicate things. Republican Sen. Mitt Romney another GOP member who voted against the bill also worried that veterans would be compensated for health conditions unrelated to their military service.

The military routinely used open burn pits to dispose of tires batteries medical waste and other materials into open burn pits during operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that led to untold health problems for thousands of veterans according to NPR.

Romney told DeseretNews that the PACT Act “would represent a dramatic expansion of qualifying conditions that aren’t necessarily service-connected disabilities.”

Most people agreed with comedian and activist Jon Stewart when he and veterans’ activists spent the week hammering Republicans for their opposition to a bill that hurt military service members’ ability to get healthcare once they return home from serving overseas.

Tillis’ opposition was a bit different from other Republicans. Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey argued that Democrats had allocated billions in spending that could later be used for purposes other than providing healthcare to military service members.

The newsletter Tangle dove deep into the issue and found merit with Republicans’ claims while noting that those same lawmakers had voted for the same bill previously before voting against it this week.

Tillis didn’t fall into either of those camps and his position is puzzling.

Luckily most Republicans in the Senate didn’t follow along with him."

Ron (many friends and family may know him as Tootie) was born May 22 1962 to Gerald and Nancy (Haack) Pfeil. Ron cherished the memories of his youth working along side his father and two brothers on their Easy St. Family farm in Waunakee. He was a master Volvo technician at Smart Motors for 25+ years and finished out his distinguished career at Carmax.

Ron was an avid hunter and outdoorsman. He especially enjoyed the fall season hunting in Hollandale on his in-law’s family’s land. He shared the love of this sport closely with his son Dakota and beloved grandson Bryson. But being “Pop-Pop” to his grandson beats them all.

Ron will be greatly missed by all that knew him especially his family that he held close. He was a wonderful father and arguably the best grandpa. We will forever hold our never-ending memories inside jokes and stories we have with him in our hearts.

He is preceded in death by the love of his life his wife Janet (Schoepp) Pfeil. As well as his brother Jerry father in-law Donald Schoepp and his parents Gerald and Nancy Pfeil.

He is survived by his daughter Lexia Pfeil and son Dakota Pfeil; grandson Bryson Feil; brother Jeff Pfeil; and many nieces nephews and cousins.

Our family would like to extend a thank you to St. Mary’s Hospital and Agrace Hospice for their care. Donations can be made to the family of Ron for a memorial to be established at a later date.”

A Celebration of Life will be held on Tuesday August 16 2022 at Rex's Innkeeper 301 N. Century Ave Waunakee from 5:00 p.m. until close (12:00 a.m.).

Cummins completes deal for Meritor

Cummins on Wednesday announced that it has completed its acquisition of Meritor.

The $3.7 billion deal announced in February includes the integration of Meritor’s people products and capabilities in axle and brake technology into Cummins’ components business.

Cummins expects to utilize its global footprint to accelerate the growth of the core axle and brake businesses by serving commercial truck trailer off-highway defense specialty and aftermarket customers around the world and the combination of the two companies will position Cummins as a leading provider of integrated powertrain solutions across internal combustion and electric power applications. Cummins intends to deliver market-leading decarbonized solutions to global customers by accelerating Meritor’s investment in electrification and integrating development within its New Power business.

“We are excited to welcome Meritor’s employees into Cummins” said Jennifer Rumsey Cummins’ president and chief executive officer. “Together Cummins and Meritor will move further and faster in developing economically viable decarbonized powertrain solutions that are better for people and our planet.”

Cummins’ Executive Chairman Tom Linebarger noted that Cummins can help grow Meritor’s core business given its sales and service network and customer relationships around the world ""and this acquisition has clear synergies for both companies that will position us for future investments during our industry’s technology transition"" he said. ""We are relentless in our focus on Destination Zero our company strategy to achieve net-zero emissions and will lead in the transition to decarbonized power. This acquisition is an important step in executing on our strategy.”

New Jersey moving company owner gets prison time for defrauding customers

Lior Atiyas (a.k.a. David Cohen) the owner of a moving company using several names was sentenced July 14 in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey to 22 months in prison three years of supervised release and a $200 special assessment. Atiyas was also ordered to forfeit $587097 according to the Department of Transportation Office of Inspector General.

In November 2020 Atiyas pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit health care fraud. According to court documents and statements made in court Atiyas devised a scheme to enrich a moving company using several names to conceal the company’s true identity including Premier Relocations LLC Metro Van Lines Inc. and others.

Between January 2016 and January 2019 Atiyas and an employee reportedly extorted customers by quoting them low estimates for moving household goods. Once the goods were loaded on trucks Atiyas directed employees to raise moving prices to amounts that were often two or three times more than initial quotes. Customers were refused their goods until they paid the higher prices.

Atiyas also admitted to participating in a scheme to defraud Medicaid by generating false paystubs and employment documents to obtain Medicaid benefits for an uncharged conspirator.

Fastfrate completes acquisition of Challenger Group

Fastfrate Group announced Wednesday it has officially completed its majority acquisition of Challenger Group (CCJ Top 250 No. 77) following Competition Bureau Canada approval on Aug. 2. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Now with seven companies and 40 locations operating across Canada and the United States Fastfrate Group is one of the largest independently owned transportation and supply chain companies in Canada with a diverse suite of services that support the increasingly complex needs of customers. This includes LTL truckload intermodal drayage logistics warehousing distribution services home delivery e-commerce and more.

“Our acquisition of the Challenger Group brings together two iconic organizations in transportation and supply chain” said Ron Tepper Chairman of Fastfrate Group. “Together we are a force within our industry that will compete collectively to deliver a complete and complementary suite of solutions to customers. This will serve to help our customers as supply chains become more diverse.”

As part of the acquisition Challenger Group will continue to operate independently under incoming CEO Jim Peeples. Manny Calandrino will remain CEO of Fastfrate Group. Current employees and management teams at both organizations will not be impacted by the transaction.

FMCSA announces grants to bring veterans into trucking

The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration has awarded $3.1 million to community colleges and training institutes through the Commercial Motor Vehicle Operator Safety Training (CMVOST) Grant Program that will assist current and former members of the Armed Forces who want to pursue careers in trucking to get commercial driver’s licenses and the training they need to enter the profession.

“Veterans know how to get things where they need to go safely” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. “At a time when our supply chain depends on having more qualified truck drivers this program will give those who have served in uniform a new and important way to contribute and benefit by launching a new career in this vital industry.”

The CMVOST grant program has three goals: to expand the number of CDL holders possessing enhanced operator safety training; to provide opportunities for current or former members of the United States Armed Forces (including National Guard members and reservists) and their spouses to enter trucking; and help increase training opportunities for candidates from underserved communities.

In fiscal year 2022 FMCSA paved the way for a broader range of institutions to apply for CMVOST grants as the agency did not require applicants to propose a local matching share of funding. FMCSA said this expansion will allow more qualified candidates from across the country to more easily be able to afford the training and licensing needed to join the trucking profession.

East Kasaï DRC 4 August 2022 – An unusual recipe is being shared by nutrition experts in a province in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) as part of a string of initiatives to combat high levels of child malnutrition in the world’s worst hunger crisis – a porridge packed with caterpillar protein.

An estimated 27 million people across the DRC - or 28% of the population - are experiencing crisis levels of acute food insecurity and the country currently hosts the largest number of highly food insecure people in the world.

With hunger and food prices rising families are being taught to make a cheap accessible and highly nutritious locally sourced dish called Musabu which combines caterpillar protein powder oil corn flour and avocado puree in a porridge. The recipe is packed with nutrients and vitamins and is particularly helpful in giving children under five the fats and proteins they need to overcome malnutrition.

The caterpillar protein powder is made from ground Massamba and Binkubala caterpillars which are harvested locally in the province of East Kasaï in central southern DRC. After being sorted for size and quality they are grilled for 5 to 10 minutes then ground in a mortar. The resulting high-protein and high-energy flour is then sieved to create a fine caterpillar powder.

Marceline 43 is a community volunteer working in the town of Tshilengue in East Kasaï. With the support of Save the Children Marceline runs cooking demonstrations in villages to show mothers and grandmothers how to source ingredients and then make Musabu themselves for their children. Marceline says:

""The recipe has been shared with us and in turn we help the mothers and carers in the families to reproduce the recipe. All the products we use are available in nature in our fields so they are easily accessible.

""We use corn flour. We add caterpillar protein powder. We have a lot of caterpillars here and then palm oil a bit of sugar salt and avocado puree at the end. The children love it. Some of them always come back to ask more so we're happy about that.

""Mothers manage to make the recipe at home and sometimes they come back to us to share amended versions of the recipe but always with local ingredients and rich in nutrients for the children. We find that the children are doing well they are less and less emaciated.""

A recent nutrition assessment in the DRC showed that nearly 860000 children under the age of five and nearly 470000 pregnant or lactating women were likely to suffer from acute malnutrition in 2022 with more than 200000 of those children expected to be severely malnourished and requiring urgent treatment to survive.

East Kasaï is one of the worst affected areas where high levels of malnutrition in children are often the result of caregivers lacking knowledge on what constitutes a balanced diet as well as poverty and rising food costs. Many families are forced to limit their meals or their variety missing out on critical vitamins and minerals.

Amavi Akpamagbo Save the Children's Country Director in DRC said:

""With a global hunger crisis putting pressure on food and aid systems around the world our teams are constantly looking for new ways to ensure malnourished children have the food they need to survive and thrive. A major part of the solution is to support communities to find local solutions to fight child malnutrition and reduce the number of cases of acute and severe acute malnutrition.

“However the situation in DRC remains deeply worrying. Last year less than 60% of children with acute malnutrition had access to treatment while the preliminary analysis for 2022 suggests this number is going down.”

Save the Children is running cooking demonstrations along with a suite of activities across DRC to combat rising rates of child malnutrition. These include running nutrition screenings so malnourished children can be referred early to health centres for rapid and appropriate treatment. Save the Children also runs programmes across the country to promote breastfeeding and good feeding practices as well as supporting mothers and children to access emergency health support when needed.

But when it comes to investments in eCommerce and other digitization efforts it can take more than one season for corporate efforts to bear fruit.

Cis a case in point. During the company’s second-quarter earnings call CEO Jim Umpleby highlighted how Cat’s growing services business and internet of things (IoT) initiatives have helped the company maintain performance in the face of stiff supply chain headwinds and rising inflation.

“We now have 1.2 million connected assets” he told analysts. “So that gives us much better visibility for everything from getting the right parts to the right dealer so that the customers get them when they need it to allowing us to help customers avoid downtime maximizing availability maximize production.”

Combined with robust eCommerce offerings and a rebound in construction and mining work after a lockdown-enforced lull and the result was a strong showing for the period despite the economy. Sales in the company’s critical U.S. market for instance rose 20% year over year.

To be sure Cat isn’t the only company enjoying near-term benefits from capital investments it made long ago. And certainly it is easier for such industrial behemoths to maintain a long-term perspective but small and medium businesses (SMBs) may be able to leverage software-as-a-service to substitute manageable subscriptions for challenging cap expenditure.

‘Hand-to-Hand Combat’

But tellingly the phrase “supply chain” was spoken 37 times during the call verbal proof of the fact that the firm while one of the largest purchasers in the world remains plagued by the persistently acute issue. The firm has not seen a significant improvement in supply chain at the macro level nor does the manufacturer of locomotives see light at the end of the tunnel.

Cat experienced supply-chain-related cost inflation including increased procurement transportation and inventory expenses. Reported commodity price drops have not yet worked their way through the supply chain.

“We have not seen a significant improvement in supply chain. It’s still hand-to-hand combat. Our teams are working way through those issues” CEO Umpleby said during the call. “We have not seen them ease. It changes from component to component. One day it’s one issue; the next day it’s another issue. But at the macro level we have not yet seen an improvement.”

From a payments perspective the struggles illustrate how important transparency and visibility up and down the supply chain line has become. The value of bundling ecommerce with the IoT to maximize efficient flow of goods and services increases by exponential orders of magnitude as a function of supply constraints.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1wcm5ld3Mub3JnL3N0b3J5LzIwMjIvMDgvMDQvbmV3LWludmFzaXZlLWluc2VjdC1mb3VuZC1pbi1taW5uZXNvdGEtZm9yLWZpcnN0LXRpbWXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New invasive insect found in Minnesota for first time,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.mprnews.org', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /story/2022/08/04/new-invasive-insect-found-in-minnesota-for-first-time (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D8501D690>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1wcm5ld3Mub3JnL3N0b3J5LzIwMjIvMDgvMDQvbmV3LWludmFzaXZlLWluc2VjdC1mb3VuZC1pbi1taW5uZXNvdGEtZm9yLWZpcnN0LXRpbWXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzA0L2ludmFzaXZlLW1vdGgtZm91bmQtZm9yLWZpcnN0LXRpbWUtaW4tbWlubmVzb3RhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Invasive moth found for first time in Minnesota,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='nypost.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2022/08/04/invasive-moth-found-for-first-time-in-minnesota/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D8501F340>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzA0L2ludmFzaXZlLW1vdGgtZm91bmQtZm9yLWZpcnN0LXRpbWUtaW4tbWlubmVzb3RhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmlldHRhdGltZXMuY29tL29waW5pb24vbG9jYWwtY29sdW1ucy8yMDIyLzA4L2EtbW9zdC11bnVzdWFsLWNyaWNrZXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A most unusual cricket | News Sports Jobs,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.mariettatimes.com/opinion/local-columns/2022/08/a-most-unusual-cricket/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmlldHRhdGltZXMuY29tL29waW5pb24vbG9jYWwtY29sdW1ucy8yMDIyLzA4L2EtbW9zdC11bnVzdWFsLWNyaWNrZXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Commercial Real Estate professionals throughout Southern California are remembering CBRE’s Stephen Bay who recently passed away. His remarkable career representing corporate occupiers including many of the world’s premier law firms spanned four decades.

Steve was a mentor and peer leader for CBRE professionals both in Los Angeles and across the country. He co-founded CBRE’s International Law Firm Practice Group and served as Chair of the group. He was a long-time member of CBRE’s Americas Producer Advisory Board and served as Chair for four years. He was also the producer leader of CBRE’s national Producer Mentor Program and provided influential support of CBRE’s first U.S. Workplace360 office in Downtown LA.

Steve garnered many accolades including earning CBRE’s Coldwell Colbert Circle status several times and was honored with the Edward. S Gordon Award. Before arriving at CBRE he was a top sales professional for Insignia where he managed the Downtown LA office. He also sat on Insignia’s Board of Directors.

Steve was greatly respected in the industry and was admired for his unwavering loyalty. He had a passion for work an unmatched commitment to clients but kept things in check with his wicked sense of humor. He was truly beloved by his team including Danny Rees and his long-time business partner Clay Hammerstein.

(Photo by Westlight/Shutterstock)

Inflation has been a highly political issue in developed countries since mid-2021 in a manner that hasn’t occurred in decades. It was only after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine however that inflation levels started soaring across the US the UK and Europe.

The impact has been more severe in the US and the UK where the conflict compounded the effect of other internal factors that have played a stronger role than in Europe. In June 2022 both the US and UK Consumer Prices Index reached 40-year highs rising by 9.4% and 9.1% respectively.

Rising levels of inflation equate to rising prices of essential consumer goods and services such as food and fuel and erode people’s and companies’ purchase power. It is little wonder then that inflation emerged as a top keyword in the first-quarter 2022 earnings calls analysed by Investment Monitor.

The relationship between inflation and foreign direct investment (FDI) however is not straightforward.

While high levels of inflation could be off-putting to foreign investors as they reduce the value of assets pegged to the local currency and lead to currency depreciation in relation to foreign currency moderate levels of inflation benefit foreign direct investors by helping to promote domestic growth reducing the value of debts to suppliers and via currency depreciation increasing the competitiveness of exports.

All eyes on talent in times of inflation

While the immediate effect of inflation on FDI flows is not evident – or cannot be proved to be such as other factors have an impact on multinational companies' (MNCs) decision to invest somewhere – the issue is certainly felt across the industry and is having an impact in other ways.

In terms of companies opening new offices or facilities abroad (or FDI in other words) the impact of inflation is twofold.

“Some companies may seek a less inflation-sensitive destination and plan to move operations there in lieu of rising costs in a current location” says Glenn Barklie chief economist at Investment Monitor. “On the other hand with rising energy and food prices driving up costs and tightening profits companies could see FDI as too risky in the current climate.”

Seth Martindale senior managing director at commercial real estate company CBRE and a member of the Site Selectors Guild board believes this is definitely the case. “I don’t’ think inflation is impacting so much where companies decide to go"" he says. ""It is impacting more whether they go at all. Not everybody is going ahead no matter what as it was the case up until 18 months ago when companies were eager to reboot operations after Covid-19.”



The second impact of inflation on businesses relates to talent and workforce. “As individuals’ costs rise there may be increased pressures on companies to raise wages” says Barklie. “People may be more open to switching roles in order to maintain a similar standard of living.”

Ever since the Covid-19 pandemic struck talent has been on the rise as an FDI driver and it is front and centre of investors’ discussions about foreign investment.

Larry Gigerich executive managing director of boutique site selection company Ginovus and vice-chair of the Site Selectors Guild says that inflation means the cost of talent has also gone up and this is having a strong impact on MNCs’ decision-making processes.

“Companies are factoring in the impact of inflation in their analyses as it relates to the cost of talent construction materials real estate and other key issues"" he adds.

“The biggest impact is on the cost of talent. Evaluating the cost availability and quality of talent is vital during the decision-making process and the impact of inflation on wage levels is now more pronounced than it has been for manufacturing jobs in particular.”

What if a recession hits?

Inflation has been soaring so much in Western countries that it has started to raise concerns that many of them may be sliding into recession.

At the end of July 2022 the US reported its second consecutive quarter of falling GDP causing observers to debate whether the country has already entered recession.

If a recession does hit the US and the UK the impact of inflation on most sectors will ease.

“If we end up in a short-term recession all sectors will see some relief from the impact of inflation due to a cooling economy and its corresponding impact on supply and demand issues” says Gigerich.

“It is hard to predict that any sector will benefit from inflationary factors because of the impact on wage levels. Core consumer products will continue to be needed to support people in their daily lives and as a result the revenue for these businesses should remain strong but they will have higher costs to produce and ship those products so it is likely to offset the benefit.”

Steven Bell is the chief economist for Europe the Middle East and Africa at asset manager Columbia Threadneedle. He believes a recession in the US and Europe is almost certain.

“Interest rates are headed higher and we are on a clear course to recession in the US and Europe"" he says. ""In the US domestic demand pressures are so strong that the Federal Reserve will have to engineer a recession to get inflation back down to target. Inflation is strong and accelerating in two key areas: rents and wages.

“[Late July's] Purchasing Managers’ Index slumped into contractionary territory and there are signs that the US labour market is slowing but that easing is coming off super strong levels.”

The picture is slightly different in Europe where any recession would be linked to more external factors mainly the rise of gas prices.

“The reasons for recession are different in Europe"" says Bell. ""Domestic sources of inflation are less strong. In the euro area wage inflation is still broadly in line with the European Central Bank's [ECB] 2% inflation target and many companies are making one-off payments to workers – payments that will be easier to reduce next year when conditions are likely to be much tougher. Recession in Europe is much more related to the cost-of-living crisis linked to gas prices.”

A recession would also put even more pressure on the cost of talent.

“As we head into a recession companies that are going to invest in FDI in the US will have to offer higher wages resulting in employees gaining a stronger bargaining power” CBRE’s Martindale says.

Will higher interest rates curb inflation?

In the attempt to stop inflation rising higher the US Federal Reserve the Bank of England and the ECB have all announced a series of interest rate hikes.

In early August the US Federal Reserve pushed them up by 75 basis points to 2.5% while the Bank of England raised them to 1.75% the highest level in 27 years.

For companies looking to expand this means a higher cost of capital especially when borrowing money.

“Capital approval plans for large-scale manufacturing plants in North America were drafted years ago in line with certain estimated costs"" says Martindale. ""If inflation is now nearly 10% higher than it was in 2021 capital approval requirements suddenly become much more expensive than budgeted for. Corporations find themselves wondering whether to go ahead or not.”

The debate is open as to whether the raising of interest rates is an effective way to quickly lower inflation.

Ginovus’s Gigerich is confident that it is. “Rapid interest rate increases in North America and Europe will certainly help to slow down the rate of inflation"" he says. ""We anticipate that at some point in 2023 inflation will moderate and be more manageable for MNCs.""

In particular a short-term recession’s impact on supply and demand will help to lower inflation.

However even if inflation does come back under control it will not be before the end of 2023 and geopolitical issues will continue to impact the road ahead.

“It is important to note that costs are not going to drop to where they were in early 2021 and we are unlikely to see 0–1% interest rate levels from central banks around the world any time soon” says Gigerich.

FDI winners and losers when inflation rises

While inflation means higher costs for businesses across the board those FDI projects that are more capital intensive and rely on materials and labour are likely to suffer more than others.

“Manufacturing assembly and other capital-intensive site selection projects are likely to be the most impacted due to the cost of construction materials and labour"" says Gigerich.

“Automotive semiconductors life sciences aerospace and other sectors within the manufacturing and assembly space will feel it the most.”

Consultancy McKinsey published a study in 2022 on the deep implications of inflation across the global economy. According to the report China South Korea and Japan have experienced less inflation during the past year when compared with other industrialised countries.

“Many locations in Europe South America and the US have seen higher levels of inflation than many other locations"" says Gigerich commenting on the report. ""It is important to note that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has certainly impacted inflation in Europe.

The corresponding eigen-displacements are shown in Fig. 1a. In this figure we further report on room temperature Raman scattering measurements performed on BaNi 2 As 2 single crystals. The experiments were carried out in backscattering geometry with XZ ZZ XX and XY configurations where the first (respectively second) letter refers to the orientation of the incident (resp. scattered) light polarization with respect to the axis of the tetragonal unit cell (Supplementary Note 3). All four Raman active optical phonon modes were detected. The A 1g mode is seen in the ZZ configuration at 172.9 cm−1 as well as in the XX channel where it partially overlaps with the B 1g mode at 158.6 cm−1. The two modes observed in the XZ channel are the doubly degenerate E g modes referred to as E g1 (41.4 cm−1) and E g2 (235.2 cm−1). With the notable exception of the lowest E g1 mode these energies are in good agreement with the predictions of ab initio calculations (see Supplementary Note 3). These calculations also allowed us to estimate the strength of the electron–phonon coupling for the different modes and revealed that the phonon exhibiting the largest coupling is the A 1g mode which consistently displays a weak Fano asymmetry. On the other hand despite the rather modest calculated electron–phonon coupling the E g1 mode is very broad (full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) ~ 22 cm−1) at room temperature indicating additional decay channels.

The singular behavior of the E g1 phonon is confirmed upon cooling. The conventional behavior of phonon is exhibited by the A 1g (Fig. 1b) mode which harden and narrow at low temperatures. In contrast the E g1 mode initially softens upon cooling starts broadening around T* ~ 200 K before splitting at lower temperatures where two peaks can be resolved; see Fig. 1c and Supplementary Note 3. Just above the first-order transition13 to a triclinic phase at T Tri = 133 K (on cooling) within which the phonon spectra qualitatively change (Supplementary Note 3 and Fig. 2) the splitting is as large as 22 cm−1 that is more than 50% of the mode’s original frequency.

The degeneracy of an E g phonon can only be lifted if the four-fold symmetry of the Ni planes is broken. This occurs across the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural transition in the Fe-based compounds Ba(Fe 1−x Co x ) 2 As 2 8910 EuFe 2 As 2 11 or FeSe12 where E g modes split into B 2g and B 3g modes. The largest reported splitting in AFe 2 As 2 (A = Ba or Eu) is ~10 cm−1 (~8% of the mode frequency)891011 significantly larger than in FeSe (~2.6 cm−1)12. In both cases this splitting is already considered unusually large in the sense that it exceeds the expectation based on the lattice distortion. The splitting in our measurements is quantitatively much larger and moreover onsets (with a broadening of the mode) at a temperature significantly higher than that at which the four-fold symmetry breaking takes place.

Before discussing the doping dependence of the effect in BaNi 2 As 2  we briefly review the potential sources of symmetry breaking that could yield a splitting of the E g1 phonon. As FeSe BaNi 2 As 2 does not exhibit any magnetic order but a unidirectional biaxial incommensurate CDW (I-CDW) above T Tri has recently been reported161920. We performed a detailed temperature-dependent x-ray diffraction (XRD) investigation of the intensity of the CDW satellite at q I-CDW = (±0.28 0 0) (Fig. 2a note that throughout the manuscript we will only refer to reciprocal lattice vectors in the tetragonal unit cell). A very weak diffuse scattering signal can be tracked up to room temperature but a strong increase of the peak intensity is only observed below ~155K. A second-order phase transition consisting of an orthorhombic distortion of the lattice can be detected through high-resolution dilatometry20 at ~142 K. In the parent compound it also manifests itself as a minimum in the derivative of the resistance against temperature dR/dT labeled T ρ (Supplementary Note 2) in Fig. 2a. In contrast to more pronounced distortions the identification of the twin structure associated with the structural change was limited in our XRD measurements to a broadening of high order Bragg reflections (e.g. (800)). This turns to our advantage as it allows us to put an upper bound on the corresponding lattice distortion \(\delta=\frac{a-b}{a+b} \sim 1{0}^{-4}\) an order of magnitude weaker than that reported in BaFe 2 As 2 and in good agreement with thermodynamic measurements21.

Cooling further the I-CDW superstructure peak is suppressed in the triclinic phase in which a commensurate CDW (C-CDW) signal develops at q C-CDW = (±1/3 0 ±1/3). We did not detect any additional phase transition in the temperature range at which the E g1 mode splitting onsets and can already conclude at this stage that this splitting is occurring in the tetragonal I4/mmm phase. Our first-principle calculations confirmed that the amplitude of the orthorhombic structural distortion is in all cases much too small to account for the gigantic energy splitting of the E g1 phonons reported here (Supplementary Note 3). Furthermore in stark contrast to Fe-based materials812 the E g1 mode splitting increases linearly and does not show any sign of saturation down to T Tri . In the same temperature range a subtle broadening of the E g2 mode (of much lower intensity) occurs.

Next we confirmed the behavior of the E g modes by studying the impact of arsenic substitution with phosphorus. This has previously been reported to suppress the triclinic transition2125 and to enhance the orthorhombic distortion2021. In Fig. 2 we show the results for \({{{{{\rm{Ba}}}}}}{{{{{{\rm{Ni}}}}}}}_{2}{({{{{{{\rm{As}}}}}}}_{1-x}{{{{{{\rm{P}}}}}}}_{x})}_{2}\) with x = 3.5% (T Tri = 95 K) and x = 7.6% (T Tri = 55 K) for which we observe a similar splitting of the E g1 mode which increases linearly as temperature decreases reaching almost 30 cm−1 at T Tri (~65% of the mode frequency). Upon further increase of the P-concentration (x = 10%) for which the triclinic (and therefore the C-CDW) transition is completely suppressed the maximal amplitude of the splitting is reduced and appears to saturate at the lowest temperatures. In all doped samples the strong increase of the I-CDW satellite intensity at q I-CDW is smoother than in the parent compound and occurs at a temperature very close to T ρ . The observation of the E g phonon broadening and splitting above any lowering of the symmetry of the compound strongly suggests a coupling of the mode to fluctuations. Given the lack of magnetism in BaNi 2 As 2  orbital degrees of freedom are the most likely candidates. This can directly be tested using electronic Raman scattering which is a particularly sensitive probe of the charge fluctuations. In Fig. 3 we show the temperature dependence of the electronic Raman response in the B 1g and B 2g channels for the x = 6.5% sample (for clarity the Raman active phonon has been subtracted from the B 1g spectrum—Supplementary Note 3). In both channels the electronic response consists of a broad continuum extending up to 1500 cm−1 akin to the particle-hole excitations seen in many correlated metals2627282930. It apparently displays a conventional metallic behavior with a smooth increase of the low frequency (≤250 cm−1) response upon cooling reflecting the decrease of the quasiparticle scattering rate Γ (which is inversely proportional to the slope of the Raman response χ″(ω)/ω∣ ω→0 in the static limit). The main difference between the two channels is quantitative: the low energy B 1g intensity gain spans over a broader energy range (≥500 cm−1) than the B 2g  it is overall larger and accelerates significantly at temperatures where the E g1 phonon splitting becomes evident below ~140 K). This observation is in line with recent elastoresistivity measurements1617 and can be interpreted as a signature of B 1g nematic fluctuations in BaNi 2 As 2 . In contrast to the electronic nematicity of the Fe-based superconductors observed in the B 2g channel the respective B 1g response in BaNi 2 As 2 appears overdamped suggesting a strong coupling of the lattice to the nematic fluctuations.

Next we develop a qualitative understanding of the ’splitting’ of the E g phonon spectrum in the absence of a structural phase transition. While the latter would lift the degeneracy and naturally cause such a splitting we show how when it does not occur the coupling of nematic fluctuations to the lattice can yield a spectral splitting of a doubly degenerated mode that bears striking similarities to our experimental observation.

We first focus on three phonon branches a transverse acoustic (TA) mode that couples to nematic order and the two degenerate optical E g modes with lattice Hamiltonian \({H}_{{{{{{\rm{latt}}}}}}}=\frac{1}{2}{\sum }_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{q}}}}}}\kappa }{\omega }_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{q}}}}}}\kappa }{a}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{q}}}}}}\kappa }^{{{\dagger}} }{a}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{q}}}}}}\kappa }\). Here κ refers to the phonon branch of frequency ω qκ . Since nematic fluctuations take place at small momenta we ignore the momentum dependence of the optical modes \({\omega }_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{q}}}}}}{E}_{g}}\approx {\omega }_{0}\). The TA mode frequency \({\omega }_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{q}}}}}}{{{{{\rm{TA}}}}}}}={c}_{{{{\hat{{{\boldsymbol{q}}}}}}}}q\) possesses a direction-dependent sound velocity \({c}_{{{{\hat{{{\boldsymbol{q}}}}}}}}\). For momenta \(\hat{q}\) along [100] [010] \({c}_{{{{\hat{{{\boldsymbol{q}}}}}}}}^{2}\) is proportional to the B 1g elastic constant \({C}_{{{{{{{\rm{B}}}}}}}_{1g}}={C}_{11}-{C}_{12}\). In our consideration we include electronic degrees of freedom with nematic character. Having in mind the absence of magnetic order in this system as well as recent observation of orbital fluctuations above the triclinic transition20 suggest that orbital degrees of freedom are the most relevant here. A natural electronic object of proper symmetry is the orbital polarization \({O}_{i}={\sum }_{\sigma=\{\uparrow\downarrow \}}\left({d}_{i\sigmaxz}^{{{\dagger}} }{d}_{i\sigmaxz}-{d}_{i\sigmayz}^{{{\dagger}} }{d}_{i\sigmayz}\right)\) at lattice site i; or its Fourier transform in momentum space O q . The Ni 3d xz and 3d yz orbitals are symmetry related in the tetragonal phase and broken nematic symmetry implies \(\left\langle {O}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{q}}}}}}}\right\rangle=\left\langle O\right\rangle {\delta }_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{q}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{0}}}}}}}\

e\ 0\). In the following we draw general conclusions that do not rely on the microscopic origin of such ordering (these go beyond the scope of this paper and will be developed in a subsequent work) nor of its microscopic nature providing that its symmetry allows a coupling to the relevant phonons.

The most direct coupling of the orbital polarization O q to elastic modes occurs through TA phonons with displacements u xy

$${H}_{c{{{{{\rm{TA}}}}}}}=-\frac{{g}_{{{{{{\rm{TA}}}}}}}}{2i}\mathop{\sum}\limits_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{q}}}}}}}{O}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{q}}}}}}}({q}_{x}{u}_{-{{{{{\boldsymbol{q}}}}}}x}-{q}_{y}{u}_{-{{{{{\boldsymbol{q}}}}}}y}).$$ (1)

This interaction imposes that orbital ordering and the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic transition occur simultaneously. Such coupling between a degenerate electronic state to TA phonons can in principle cause nematic order akin to a cooperative Jahn–Teller effect31. Even when the nematicity is primarily of electronic origin the nemato-elastic coupling of Eq. (1) will always increase the tendency towards nematic order32 consistent with the Jahn-Teller argument. It leads in any event to a lattice softening near the transition and allows probing the nematic susceptibility via measurements of the elastic constant \({C}_{{B}_{1g}}\)332 the elastoresistivity17 or the B 1g -Raman response33.

By symmetry the coupling of the orbital polarization to optical E g phonon modes is given by

$${H}_{c{E}_{g}}=\frac{{g}_{{E}_{g}}}{2N}\mathop{\sum}\limits_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{k}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{q}}}}}}}{O}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{q}}}}}}}({u}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{k}}}}}}x}{u}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{-k}}}}}}-{{{{{\boldsymbol{q}}}}}}x}-{u}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{k}}}}}}y}{u}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{-k}}}}}}-{{{{{\boldsymbol{q}}}}}}y}).$$ (2)

In the case of a finite nematic order parameter \(\left\langle O\right\rangle

e 0\) the degeneracy of the E g phonons is lifted \({\omega }_{0}\to \sqrt{{\omega }_{0}^{2}\pm {g}_{{E}_{g}}\left\langle O\right\rangle }\) as the protecting symmetry is broken. The splitting of the squared frequencies is directly proportional to the order parameter.

While symmetry breaking is necessary to lift the degeneracy and to induce a nematic order parameter it is not the only approach to achieve spectral splitting. Next we show that this can indeed arise from a purely dynamical effect which relates to the dynamic Jahn-Teller effect34 albeit rather originating from fluctuations of electronic degrees of freedom than from a large zero-point energy of vibronic modes. Similar phenomena have been reported in the half-field Holstein model35.

In order to get a qualitative understanding of such a dynamic splitting we consider a simple toy model that directly follows from our above description. We assume that O i behaves as an effective Ising variable \({O}_{i}={A}_{0}{\tau }_{i}^{z}\) with typical amplitude A 0 . The Ising pseudospin states \(\left|\Uparrow \right\rangle \) and \(\left|\Downarrow \right\rangle \)—defining the basis for the Pauli matrix τz— describe the two orbital polarizations. Then the Hamiltonian takes the form

$${H}_{c{E}_{g}}=\lambda \frac{{\omega }_{0}^{2}}{2}\mathop{\sum}\limits_{i}{\tau }_{i}^{z}({u}_{ix}^{2}-{u}_{iy}^{2})+\mathop{\sum}\limits_{i}\frac{{{\Omega }}}{2}{\tau }_{i}^{x}.$$ (3)

Here \(\lambda={g}_{{E}_{g}}{A}_{0}/{\omega }_{0}^{2}\) is a dimensionless nemato-elastic coupling constant. In the ordered state the two modes become \({\omega }_{0}\to {\omega }_{0}\sqrt{1\pm \lambda \left\langle {\tau }^{z}\right\rangle }\) in agreement with the discussion above. Note that the model can be easily adapted to the coupling of B 2g nematicity relevant for Fe-based superconductors using u ix . u iy instead of \({u}_{ix}^{2}-{u}_{iy}^{2}\) in the previous equation. This yields exactly the same results albeit with a different strain dependence. From the splitting of the E g phonons8 we can estimate λ ~ 0.08 for BaFe 2 As 2  much weaker than λ ~ 0.7 of the Ni-system. To model quantum fluctuations we introduced the last term that gives rise to tunneling processes between the two degenerate states36. Using a variational approach3738 one can show that the tunneling rate can be thought of as a renormalized quantity \({{{\Omega }}}_{0}\to {{\Omega }}={{{\Omega }}}_{0}{e}^{-\int

olimits_{0}^{{\omega }_{c}}\frac{{{{{{\rm{Im}}}}}}{{\Gamma }}(\omega )}{{(\omega+{{{\Omega }}}_{0})}^{2}}{{{\rm{d}}}}\omega }\) rooted in a more complex dynamic nematic susceptibility of the form \({\chi }_{{{{{{\rm{nem}}}}}}}({{\Omega }})={[{{{\Omega }}}_{0}^{2}-{\omega }^{2}+{{\Gamma }}(\omega )]}^{-1}\) similar to other pseudospin problems39.

The electronic degrees of freedom will now give rise to some coupling of the \({\tau }_{i}^{z}\) at different lattice sites responsible for actual nematic order. If we assume a mean field description of the tetragonal phase different lattice sites decouple. Still \({H}_{{{{{{\rm{latt}}}}}}{E}_{g}}+{H}_{c{E}_{g}}\) that describes the E g phonons is a many-body model of interacting pseudospin and lattice vibrations. It is possible to obtain an exact solution of the model with many-body eigenenergies:

$${E}_{{m}_{1}{m}_{2}s}={\epsilon }_{+}({m}_{1}+{m}_{2}+1/2)+s\sqrt{{\epsilon }_{-}^{2}{\left({m}_{1}-{m}_{2}\right)}^{2}+\frac{{{{\Omega }}}^{2}}{4}}$$ (4)

where \(2{\epsilon }_{\pm }={\omega }_{0}(\sqrt{1+\lambda }\pm \sqrt{1-\lambda })\) the indices m 12 = 0 1 2 ⋯ refer to phonon occupations of the E gx and E gy modes and s = ± 1 corresponds to the pseudospin states \(\left|\pm \right\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\left|\Uparrow \right\rangle \pm \left|\Downarrow \right\rangle )\). From an analysis of the spectral functions follows that both phonon modes are degenerate and at T = 0 have two dominant peaks at ω 0± = E 10± − E 00± = E 01± − E 00± with splitting Δω = ω + − ω − ; see Fig. 4a b. For λ = 0 ω 0+ = ω 0− = ω 0  i.e. there is no splitting. However since the pseudospin splitting \({E}_{{m}_{1}{m}_{2}+}-{E}_{{m}_{1}{m}_{2}-}\) of the many-body eigenstates depends on the phonon-population via \({\epsilon }_{-}^{2}{({m}_{1}-{m}_{2})}^{2}\) both E g -modes split in two main satellites by \({{\Delta }}\omega=\sqrt{{{{\Omega }}}^{2}+2{\omega }_{0}^{2}(1-\sqrt{1-{\lambda }^{2}})}-{{\Omega }}\). For weak coupling λ ≪ Ω/ω 0 (relevant for Fe-based systems) holds \({{\Delta }}\omega={\lambda }^{2}{\omega }_{0}^{2}/{{\Omega }}\) such that the splitting is small Δω/ω 0 ≪ 1. However as soon as λ is larger than Ω/ω 0 we have Δω ≈ λω 0 and the splitting of both E g -modes is of order unity (note that the system becomes unstable as λ → 1 which signals a structural instability).

To obtain a qualitative understanding of the origin of this behavior we use our earlier result for the static lifting \( \sim \lambda \left\langle {\tau }^{z}\right\rangle {\omega }_{0}\) of the degeneracy and replace it by \(\sqrt{{\lambda }^{2}\left\langle {({\tau }^{z})}^{2}\right\rangle }{\omega }_{0} \sim \lambda {\omega }_{0}\). This simply indicates that when the fluctuations between degenerate nematic configurations are strongly coupled and slow compared to the timescale of phonons (Ω ≲ ω 0 ) a split spectral structure for the phonons similar to that induced by static ordering can be obtained. In Fig. 4a b we also show the behavior at finite T where several additional satellites enter the analysis but the overall behavior remains unchanged. Finally we can include externally applied stress σ ext that explicitly breaks the four-fold symmetry via \({H}_{\sigma }=-\!{\sum }_{i}{\sigma }_{{{{{{\rm{ext}}}}}}}{\tau }_{i}^{z}\). Now the degeneracy of the two E g phonons is lifted. We then observe merely a gradual transfer of weight between the split peaks see Fig. 4c.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL2VkdGVjaG1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9rMTIvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDIyLzA4L3doYXQtZG8tay0xMi1pdC1sZWFkZXJzLW5lZWQta25vdy1hYm91dC1jeWJlci1saWFiaWxpdHktaW5zdXJhbmNlLXNjaG9vbC1kaXN0cmljdHMtcGVyZmNvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Essentials of Cyber Liability Insurance for Schools,"As cyberattacks against K–12 districts become more frequent and more sophisticated school leaders are paying the price in the form of cyber liability insurance premium hikes. One school district in Illinois reported a 334% premium cost increase and a Gallagher Report suggests this number isn’t out of the ordinary. The 2022 “Cyber Market Conditions” report indicates school districts may face a 100 to 300 percent increase in the cost of premiums if they don’t have “best in class” security controls in place.

In some instances insurance companies may refuse to cover districts without adequate cybersecurity measures. This could leave school leaders scrambling to find new cyber liability insurance and make upgrades to encourage companies to provide coverage.

“What you’re seeing is an evolution from an informal to a very formalized structure” says Paul Kinder managing director of cybersecurity at Focal Point Data Risk. “Insurance is becoming much more strict and much more granular.”

Here’s what IT leaders should know about cyber liability insurance keeping premiums low and getting the help they need.

What Is Cyber Liability Insurance and Why Do Districts Need It?

Cyber liability insurance protects school districts in the event of cyberattacks or data breaches. The insurance covers the costs schools could face in the wake of ransomware attacks and other cybersecurity dilemmas.

In 2021 ransomware attacks cost U.S. schools $3.65 billion in downtime and recovery. That doesn’t include the additional cost to districts that paid multimillion-dollar ransoms.

How Can Schools Keep Cyber Liability Insurance Premiums Low?

Schools can keep cyber liability insurance premiums low by upgrading their cybersecurity measures.

“If you’re going up for renewal and you want to lower your premiums the cybersecurity insurance providers are looking for the least risky clients in their portfolio” says Victor Marchetto senior consulting cybersecurity engineer at CDW. “They’re trying to re-evaluate at each turn the level of risk they hold with different policies. So the less risky you can appear to these entities the less you’re going to pay in premiums.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9ycy5jb20vZXRmcy1hbmQtZnVuZHMvbXV0dWFsLWZ1bmRzL2Jlc3QtbXV0dWFsLWZ1bmRzLWJldC1iaWctb24tYWFwbC1zdG9jay1hcy10ZWNoLXN0b2NrLWJlZ2luLXJlYm91bmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Best Mutual Funds Bet Big On AAPL Stock — And These Other Names,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-bet-big-on-aapl-stock-as-tech-stock-begin-rebound/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9ycy5jb20vZXRmcy1hbmQtZnVuZHMvbXV0dWFsLWZ1bmRzL2Jlc3QtbXV0dWFsLWZ1bmRzLWJldC1iaWctb24tYWFwbC1zdG9jay1hcy10ZWNoLXN0b2NrLWJlZ2luLXJlYm91bmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

UnitedHealth Group and CVS Health are by far the most vertically integrated companies among the six major national payers with each encompassing a sprawling enterprise with a slew of diverse businesses under its umbrella. At UnitedHealth for instance Optum has repeatedly posted double-digit growth and executives said they believe the business arm has plenty of ""untapped potential"" still to find.

In particular Optum's provider services arm Optum Health is a major growth engine within the company and UnitedHealth has made multiple acquisitions this year alone to bring additional docs into the fold.

Aetna has also grown steadily since it joined CVS Health in late 2018 but the company also brings in significant cash from its retail pharmacies and pharmacy benefit manager Caremark. But CVS is taking a cue from its rival and looking to bulk out its healthcare services including the potential for a primary care acquisition sometime this year.

As Optum continues to grow competitors are starting to take lessons from UnitedHealth Group's success.

Cigna beats out Elevance Health formerly Anthem to be the third-highest revenue earner in both Q2 and H1 2022 but falls short of its rival on profitability. Much of Cigna's revenue growth over the past several quarters is attributable to Evernorth the sister company to its health plan that includes a major national PBM Express Scripts telehealth services data analytics and more.

Elevance Health too rebranded earlier this year as it looks to grow beyond simply being a health plan and instead a ""lifetime trusted partner"" in its members' health.

Cigna reported $45.4 billion in revenue for the second quarter and $89.5 billion in the first half of the year. Anthem brought in $38.6 billion in revenue for Q2 and $76.7 billion in H1 revenue.

Elevance Health meanwhile earned $1.7 billion in profit for Q2 and $3.5 billion in profit through the first six months of 2022. Cigna earned $1.6 billion in the second quarter and $2.7 billion in the first half of the year.

Five of the six major insurers did post profits in the second quarter with only Centene reporting a $172 million loss. The government insurer is profitable for the first half of the year however earning $677 million through the first two quarters of the year.

Centene is in the middle of the pack on revenue both in the second quarter and in the first half of the year according to its earnings reports. The company brought in $39.5 billion in revenue for Q2 and $73.1 billion in revenue through the first six months of 2022.

Humana beats out Centene in profitability but lands in sixth place for revenues according to its earnings report. The insurer reported $23.7 billion in revenue for the quarter and $696 million in profit. For the first half of the year it brought in $47.6 billion in revenue and $1.6 billion in profit.

Echoing other competitors in the market alongside its earnings Humana announced a plan to consolidate its operations into an insurance services arm as well as a healthcare services arm CenterWell. Humana has made multiple acquisitions of late to bulk up CenterWell most notably its buy of Kindred at Home which made it the largest provider of home health services in the United States.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9zdGxvdWlzL25ld3MvMjAyMi8wOC8wNC9tb3N0LWluZmx1ZW50aWFsLWJ1c2luZXNzLXdvbWVuLTIwMjItZG9yb3RoeS1jYXJsaS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Most Influential Business Women 2022: Dorothy Carlin grows market research firm to $2M in revenue - St. Louis ...,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9zdGxvdWlzL25ld3MvMjAyMi8wOC8wNC9tb3N0LWluZmx1ZW50aWFsLWJ1c2luZXNzLXdvbWVuLTIwMjItZG9yb3RoeS1jYXJsaS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D82F9ABC0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9zdGxvdWlzL25ld3MvMjAyMi8wOC8wNC9tb3N0LWluZmx1ZW50aWFsLWJ1c2luZXNzLXdvbWVuLTIwMjItZG9yb3RoeS1jYXJsaS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,,,,

During the second quarter conference call the CEO said CenterPoint has increased its $19.3 billion five-year capital investment plan twice since last September.

“Our 10-year plan is still currently expected to be $40 billion-plus in investments to support the safety resiliency and growth across our system to benefit our customers” he told investors.

As a result of this uptick the stock closed yesterday’s trading at $73.60.

Why the Uptick?

The highly impressive July traffic numbers led to the stock price gain on Aug 3. The carrier flew 16.8 million passengers in the month the highest ever traffic volume at RYAAY in the said month. Last July only 9.3 million passengers were transported by RYAAY.

Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) increased to 96% from 80% in July 2021. The number of passengers attracted by RYAAY in July 2022 was 14.2% higher than the 14.8 million passengers flown in July 2019 (pre-coronavirus era). July performance was recorded despite some of Ryanair’s cabin crew staff in certain European countries being on strike. RYAAY operated more than 92000 flights in July.

Ryanair has been benefiting from improved traffic owing to upbeat air-travel demand for quite some time as COVID-19 restrictions are relaxed. In first-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Jun 30 2022) RYAAY’s revenues surged 602% year over year to €2.6 billion on the back of buoyant traffic. Scheduled revenues in the fiscal first quarter increased 720% to €1.58 billion.

The number of passengers who flew on RYAAY planes were 45.5 million in the quarter up 461% year over year. The traffic was 9% more than the pre-COVID levels. Load factor in first-quarter fiscal 2023 was 92% compared with 73% a year ago.

Sony Universal Warner and their various subsidiaries sued Charter in US District Court in Colorado in March 2019 in a suit that claimed the ISP helps subscribers pirate music by selling packages with higher Internet speeds. They filed another lawsuit against Charter in the same court in August 2021.

Both cases were settled. The record labels and Charter told the court of their settlements on Tuesday in filings that said ""The Parties hereby notify the Court that they have resolved the above-captioned action."" Upon the settlements the court vacated the pending trials and asked the parties to submit dismissal papers within 28 days.

Charter subsidiary Bright House Networks also settled a similar lawsuit in US District Court for the Middle District of Florida this week. The record labels' case in Florida was settled one day before a scheduled trial as TorrentFreak reported Tuesday. The case was dismissed with prejudice after the settlement.

No details on any of the settlements were given in the documents notifying the courts. A three-week jury trial in one of the Colorado cases was scheduled to begin in June 2023 but is no longer needed.

The question for Internet users is whether the settlements mean that Charter will be more aggressive in terminating subscribers who illegally download copyrighted material. Charter declined to comment today when we asked if it agreed to increase account terminations of subscribers accused of piracy. We also contacted the big three record labels and will update this article if they provide any information on the settlements. Advertisement

$1 billion Cox verdict may force ISPs to cut off subscribers

Even if the settlements have no specific provision on terminating subscribers Charter presumably has to pay the record labels to settle the claims. That could make the country's second-biggest ISP more likely to terminate subscribers accused of piracy in order to prevent future lawsuits.

A jury ruled in December 2019 that Cox must pay $1 billion in damages to the major record labels in a case filed in US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. That decision raised alarm bells for the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) the Center For Democracy and Technology the American Library Association the Association of College and Research Libraries the Association of Research Libraries and consumer-advocacy group Public Knowledge.

Those groups warned in a June 2021 court filing that the verdict if not overturned ""will force ISPs to terminate more subscribers with less justification or risk staggering liability."" The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit heard oral arguments in March 2022 and has not yet issued a ruling.

Charter motion to dismiss denied

In the Colorado court the record labels' complaint said Charter ""has knowingly contributed to and reaped substantial profits from massive copyright infringement committed by thousands of its subscribers. Charter has insisted on doing nothing—despite receiving thousands of notices that detailed the illegal activity of its subscribers despite its clear legal obligation to address the widespread illegal downloading of copyrighted works on its Internet services and despite being sued previously by Plaintiffs for similar conduct.""

Charter argued in a motion to dismiss the case that ""a failure to terminate a customer's access to the Internet based solely upon unverified (and unverifiable) notices alleging past infringement does not demonstrate the requisite intent by an ISP to encourage infringement."" Charter said it has a ""policy to not terminate customer accounts based solely upon the receipt of notices containing unverifiable accusations of infringement.""

Charter also wrote that ""[p]laintiffs do not (and cannot) allege that termination restricts access to the infringing content. It is common sense that terminating a customer's Internet connection does not prevent a customer from finding another source of Internet access nor does it impact the availability of the allegedly infringing content hosted via peer-to-peer networks or programs. Charter has no more ability to block access to peer-to-peer networks than a subscriber's electric company."" Charter's motion to dismiss the case was denied and the company ultimately chose not to go to trial.

In Florida the judge dismissed the record labels' claim for vicarious liability but the industry's complaint also sought damages for vicarious copyright infringement.

Pallone (D-N.J.) sent letters to the chief executives of Exxon Mobil Corp. Chevron Corp. Shell PLC and BP PLC saying his committee is investigating “what oil companies could and should be doing to bring down gas prices.”

The four companies earned more than $50 billion in the second quarter of 2022 as Russia’s war in Ukraine pushed up oil prices and the average price of gasoline in the United States exceeded $5 a gallon. It was the best quarter on record for Exxon Chevron and Shell and the best since 2008 for BP according to Reuters (Energywire Aug. 1).

“Your company is positioned to help alleviate Americans’ pain at the pump but I am concerned that you are more focused on rewarding company executives and shareholders” Pallone’s letters said.

Pallone asked how much of their earnings the companies planned to spend on executive compensation dividends and shareholder buybacks and also how much of their capital budget will go to conventional oil and gas production versus cleaner forms of energy.

The letters were sent the same day U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres called on governments to tax the oil companies’ profits and “use the funds to support the most vulnerable people through these difficult times.”

“It is immoral for oil and gas companies to be making record profits from the current energy crisis on the backs of the poorest at a massive cost to the climate” Guterres a former prime minister of Portugal who has led the United Nations since 2017 said during a press conference at the U.N. headquarters.

The oil companies while acknowledging that consumers are struggling with high costs defended their record while releasing financial results over the last week. On a call with reporters yesterday Shell CEO Ben van Beurden was asked about public anger over high energy costs.

“In the end our role is to supply the energy the world needs and that is what we are doing” he said. In an email to E&E News Shell added that it continues to “convey to Congress and the Administration that we will do all we can to increase production at this tumultuous time.“

BP CEO Bernard Looney responding to a financial analyst’s question about the U.K.’s “cost of living crisis” during an earnings call Tuesday said some of the company’s spending will create jobs in the U.K. both in fossil fuel production and renewable energy. The company also pays higher taxes when energy prices go up including the U.K.’s recently-enacted windfall tax on oil production he said.

“We get it” Looney said. “Our people inside the company get it. They want to help.”

U.S. companies typically only take questions from stock analysts when they announce their earnings and weren’t directly asked about political pressure on high energy prices.

Like the British-based companies though Exxon and Chevron highlighted investments in new oil production and new refining capacity which they argue will help bring down the price of oil and gasoline.

Exxon increased its output from the Permian Basin oil field by about 130000 barrels a day spokesperson Casey Norton said in an email yesterday. It plans to expand its Beaumont Texas refinery by about 250000 barrels a day at the beginning of 2023 the largest domestic expansion of a refinery since 2012.

“We leaned in when others leaned out” Exxon CEO Darren Woods told analysts last week.

Chevron did not provide comment in time for publication.

Oil prices topped $120 a barrel in June in part because of economic sanctions on Russia’s oil industry. At the same time Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries have declined to ramp up their own production which could drive down prices.

The Big Oil companies which also operate their own refineries saw record margins on the crude that they processed into gasoline and diesel. Several refineries closed during the Covid-19 pandemic when demand for fuel plummeted and that meant that the remaining refineries were more profitable when consumption began to rise this year (Energywire May 5).

Since the end of June oil prices have fallen below $95 a barrel this week largely because of concerns about a recession and the price of U.S. gasoline retreated to $4.16 yesterday according to AAA.

Latkanich is a resident of Washington County Pennsylvania one of the state’s most heavily fracked regions. In 2020 an EHNinvestigation found evidence that Latkanich and his son Ryan had been exposed to harmful chemicals like benzene toluene and styrene. Now researchers have uncovered more harmful substances in Latkanich’s tap water —“forever chemicals.” Last year it was revealed that these chemicals collectively referred to as PFAS (per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances) have been used in U.S. oil and gas wells for decades. As far as the experts we spoke with know this is the first time PFAS that may be linked to fracking have been detected in household drinking water. The chemicals don’t break down naturally so they linger in the environment and human bodies. Exposure is linked to health problems including kidney and testicular cancer liver and thyroid problems reproductive problems lowered vaccine efficacy in children and increased risk of birth defects among others. Latkanich’s water smells strange and tastes bad and his son Ryan has emerged from the bathtub or shower with sores on his skin. Latkanich and Ryan have both had a host of ongoing health issues over the last decade including stomach problems asthma attacks rashes and eye irritation; and for Bryan repeated hospitalization for kidney issues. “I’m wondering what this stuff does to your joints and your heart and how it affects everything else I’m feeling” Bryan told EHN. “My kidneys are already shot. I just want these people to stop. They gotta stop poisoning people.” Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh recently tested water samples from multiple taps at the Latkanich home. They detected seven of the 14 PFAS they tested for. “What’s scary is that they didn’t just find one they found a bunch of PFAS” Latkanich said. “They don’t even have guidelines on some of these yet.”

Credit: Connor Mulvaney/EHN The chemicals which are extremely water-repellent are sometimes used in fracking fluid to make the chemical mixture more stable and to more efficiently flush oil and gas out of the ground at high pressure. There’s also evidence that the chemicals are used during initial drilling and other phases of oil and gas extraction but companies aren’t required to disclose those chemicals so there’s no way of knowing how widespread the practice is. The new findings suggest PFAS contamination may represent yet another problem left in the wake of fracking. But a lack of transparency in the industry makes it impossible to track where the chemicals have been used. And secrecy about ingredients throughout the supply chain for drilling and fracking chemicals make it difficult to hold any one company accountable for PFAS contamination in drinking water leaving people like Latkanich — and regulators and scientists — in the dark. “It’s very difficult to conduct scientifically rigorous tests on an industry that operates with so much secrecy” Dusty Horwitt a consultant with the environmental health advocacy group Physicians for Social Responsibility told EHN. Horwitt was a co-author of the report that initially uncovered the use of PFAS in fracking wells. The PFAS in Latkanich’s water have national implications. Physicians for Social Responsibility’s report found evidence that oil and gas companies including Chevron and Exxon Mobil have used PFAS or substances that could degrade into PFAS in more than 1200 fracking wells in Arkansas Louisiana Oklahoma New Mexico Texas and Wyoming. They also noted that PFAS could have been used in additional states and in additional types of wells. A 2021 investigation by the Philadelphia Inquirer found evidence that PFAS had been used in at least eight oil and gas wells in Pennsylvania but the state’s PFAS action team has not publicly addressed the issue of PFAS in the state’s oil and gas wells and did not respond to questions about whether it is assessing the potential for widespread PFAS contamination from oil and gas wells. This is especially troubling for people using private drinking water wells like Latkanich who tend to live in rural areas where oil and gas extraction takes place. An estimated 43 million Americans use private wells which are not protected by the federal Safe Water Drinking Act and aren’t regulated in most states so the water isn’t routinely tested or monitored and the responsibility for cleaning up dangerous chemicals falls to homeowners. “Considering how toxic and persistent these chemicals are and the evidence that they have been used in oil and gas extraction for decades” Horwitt said “it’s critical for state regulators to start looking for these contaminants in people’s drinking water near oil and gas sites.”

Exceeding health thresholds Bryan and Ryan Latkanich in front of their home in Washington County PA Credit: Connor Mulvaney/EHN Carla Ng a researcher who studies PFAS at the University of Pittsburgh and who supervised Latkanich’s water tests said it’s possible the contamination came from the fracking wells that were previously drilled and operated 400 feet from Latkanich’s home but there’s no way to know for sure. “It’s really frustrating that we don’t know exactly what chemicals were used [in the wells] so we don’t even know exactly what to test for” she told EHN. In the absence of that information Ng tested for 14 common PFAS. They detected seven compounds in one or more of the water samples from Latkanich’s home: PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic acid)

PFOS (Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid)

PFHpA (Perfluoroheptanoic acid)

PFNA (Perfluorononanoic acid)

PFDA (Perfluorodecanoic acid)

PFDS (Perfluorodecanesulfonic acid)

PFHxS (Perfluorohexanesulfonic acid) The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently set new health advisory limits for a handful of the most well-studied PFAS including PFOA and PFOS. Health advisory limits are not enforceable regulations but are recommended limits on how much of a chemical people should be exposed to over the course of their lives to avoid health risks. The levels of PFOA and PFOS detected in Latkanich’s water were 280 times higher and 379 times higher respectively than the new federal thresholds. Ng noted that PFAS contamination is widespread in U.S. drinking water and though they’re well above the EPA’s new guidelines the levels in Latkanich’s water aren’t uncommon.

“These health advisory limits are basically saying that these compounds are a health concern even at very low levels” she said. “But at the same time you’d be hard pressed to find water in the United States that doesn’t exceed those thresholds.”

A dangerous lack of transparency A drilling rig in Washington County PA. Credit: Ted Auch FracTracker Alliance 2016 In Pennsylvania fracking companies must publicly disclose what chemicals they use but they’re permitted to withhold “trade secrets.” This exemption is used frequently. “Secret” ingredients were used in more than half of Pennsylvania fracking wells developed between 2013 and 2017 with the most heavy usage of secret chemicals occurring in southwestern Pennsylvania where Latkanich lives. Pennsylvania isn’t alone. Most states with oil and gas development have trade-secret loopholes in their chemical disclosure laws. In Colorado for example 414 million pounds of chemicals used in the state’s fracking wells were left unidentified as “trade secrets” between 2011 and 2021 according to a 2022 report from Physicians for Social Responsibility. In some states like Pennsylvania oil and gas companies are required to disclose complete lists of fracking chemicals to regulators including ingredients that are withheld from the public as trade secrets. However a new report published this month by Physicians for Social Responsibility found that manufacturers of the chemical mixtures used in fracking wells aren’t required to disclose complete lists of ingredients to oil and gas companies in most of those states including Pennsylvania. “Chemical manufacturers know best what ingredients are being used but they often don’t tell companies further down the supply chain because they don’t have to” said Horwitt lead author of the new report. “This means regulators might not be getting the information they’re supposed to.”

“They knew this stuff could be in there but they never looked for it” Bryan Latkanich in his Washington County PA home. Credit: Connor Mulvaney/EHN Latkanich’s drinking water has been plagued with problems since two fracking wells were drilled in his backyard in 2011 and 2012. The wells were plugged in 2020 but because PFAS are so persistent Ng said it’s possible that contamination built up in the plumbing and pipes. Numerous organizations have tested the Latkanich’s water including EHN the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) (DEP) and Chevron the company that drilled operated and plugged the fracking wells on Bryan’s property. EHN’s testing found chemicals including butyl cyclohexane tetradecane and naphthalene in Latkanich’s water. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection found methane and radium but has stated Chevron is not responsible for any contamination because similar contaminants were detected in pre-drill water samples. Chevron also tested his water and maintained that their wells did not cause contamination.



But no one had tested Bryan’s water for PFAS before now. “The DEP isn’t checking for this stuff because they don’t want to find it” Latkanich said. “I’ve been trying to figure out what’s wrong with my water since 2013. They knew this stuff could be in there but they never looked for it.” Despite repeated requests the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection refused to answer questions about whether they’d received complete lists of the chemicals used in the wells on Latkanich’s property from Chevron and why the agency had never tested his water for PFAS. Agency spokesperson Neil Shader said the agency is conducting a new investigation into Latkanich’s water. He refused to say whether the investigation will include screening for PFAS. Latkanich said he had not heard from anyone at the state agency regarding a new investigation and that they had not collected any new water samples. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection recently tested drinking water throughout the state for PFAS but those tests didn’t include any private wells or drinking water sources near oil and gas sites. Shader refused to answer questions about why the agency didn’t look at oil and gas sites as part of its statewide PFAS investigation and whether it will do so in the future. Pennsylvania is second in the nation for the number of private wells (behind Michigan). More than three million Pennsylvanians rely on private wells mostly in rural areas where oil and gas development occurs. Private wells aren’t regulated in the state so people living near oil and gas sites who are concerned about PFAS currently have no option but to pay for their own testing which costs around $200 per sample according to Ng. “We should be thinking about how to enable more widespread testing of well water throughout Pennsylvania to figure out the potential scale of this problem” Ng said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vdWsubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vZmluYW5jZS9uZXdzL2Z1dHVyZXMtc3RlYWR5LXJhbGx5LWV5ZXMtbGFib3ItMTE1MTQ4MzczLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wall Street ends mixed as investors eye jobs data,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vdWsubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vZmluYW5jZS9uZXdzL2Z1dHVyZXMtc3RlYWR5LXJhbGx5LWV5ZXMtbGFib3ItMTE1MTQ4MzczLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D82BA1030>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vdWsubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vZmluYW5jZS9uZXdzL2Z1dHVyZXMtc3RlYWR5LXJhbGx5LWV5ZXMtbGFib3ItMTE1MTQ4MzczLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpaml0aW1lcy5jb20uZmovdS1uLWNoaWVmLXVyZ2VzLXRheC1vbi1ncm90ZXNxdWUtZ3JlZWQtb2Ytb2lsLWdhcy1jb21wYW5pZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.N. chief urges tax on 'grotesque greed' of oil gas companies,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpaml0aW1lcy5jb20uZmovdS1uLWNoaWVmLXVyZ2VzLXRheC1vbi1ncm90ZXNxdWUtZ3JlZWQtb2Ytb2lsLWdhcy1jb21wYW5pZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D82BA09D0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpaml0aW1lcy5jb20uZmovdS1uLWNoaWVmLXVyZ2VzLXRheC1vbi1ncm90ZXNxdWUtZ3JlZWQtb2Ytb2lsLWdhcy1jb21wYW5pZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

On the one hand we have another name in hamburgers trying to reinvent the wheel and having a hard time with it while on the other a fresh approach to simple food that offers consumers choice flavor and value and the difference is seen in the results. Shake Shack just released its Q2 earnings report and it paints a much different picture than the one given by Chipotle Mexican Grill. The burger chain is showing top-line weakness and elusive profitability while the other is growing the top and bottom lines and guiding the market higher.

Chipotle Mexican Grill Sizzles While Shake Shack Fizzles

To be fair Chipotle Mexican Grill and Shake Shack are different-sized companies in different phases of their growth but there is still something to be said of the comparison. Shake Shack should be sustaining its high levels of revenue growth or even accelerating and not decelerating and missing the consensus as it did in Q2. In a different situation the 23% YOY growth posted by Shake Shack is good news but it does not support the 316X(forward) earnings multiple and the hard times are not over.

Assuming Shake Shack’s revenue improves over the next quarter inflation is still high and offsetting the advance. Sales are up 23.2% this quarter but food inflation and labor costs are up 30% each and there is no real sign inflation is slowing. The bottom line results were slightly higher than expected but still resulted in no profits. The company may have to lean into higher prices to offset the advance in costs and that could cut into traffic and offset the impact of a rising store count.

Meanwhile Chipotle was able to leverage its brand and eCommerce channels to drive top and bottom line outperformance. More importantly it is sustaining double-digit comps equal to Shake Shack and widening its margins as well. Chipotle reported a 230 basis point improvement in the operating margin that has its profits on the rise outpacing revenue growth and at record levels. As for the value Chipotle trades at a high 48X earnings multiple but it has earnings cash flow is robust pricing power is present and continued growth is in the outlook.

""We are pleased with our second quarter performance during a period of inflation and consumer uncertainty"" said Chipotle Mexican Grill CEO Brian Niccol. ""Our pricing power and value proposition remain strong as our culinary and food with integrity commitment continues to be a key point of differentiation.""

The Analysts Like Chipotle Mexican Grill Better

The analyst sentiment is clearly tilted in favor of Chipotle Mexican Grill. It’s still early for Shake Shack updates but that may not matter the current consensus rating is a Hold compared to Chipotle’s Moderate Buy and Shake Shack sentiment is slipping while Chipotle’s sentiment is firming. As for the price targets the analysts see about 44% upside in Shake Shack but this target is trending lower in all the 12 3 and 1-month comparisons and will likely fall further now the results are out. Chipotle’s price target implies a more modest 15% of upside but that target is firming and edging higher after an analyst reboot earlier in the year.

The Technical Outlook: Chipotle Mexican Grill Is Outperforming

Both stocks have had a decent rebound from the pandemic low but Chipotle Mexican Grill is clearly outperforming. This stock is up nearly 200% since spring 2020 while Shake Shak is up only 45%. Assuming the two companies will continue to perform as they have been relative to each other the odds are high that Chipotle Mexican Grill will continue to outperform for the foreseeable future.

PITTSFIELD Mass.-

There is a new taco in town.



Chipotle Mexican Grill opened in Taco Bell's former location in Berkshire Crossing on Thursday. To mark the occasion the first 50 people in line received merchandise from the chain restaurant.

Shortly after its doors opened the eatery was buzzing with customers.



""We have received great feedback from other Chipotle locations surrounding the area and think Pittsfield’s burrito fan would be thrilled to have their own Chipotle location"" Spokesperson Sally Evans said.



Along with a modern renovation of the building there is a ""Chipotlane"" drive-thru lane that allows customers to retrieve digital orders from their cars.



There is now a variety of Mexican-inspired choices in the area as Taco Bell built a new location across the street on Dalton Avenue.

Here's a look at some of them:

CHIPOTLE: Great Falls will be getting a Chipotle restaurant. It will be built on the lot formerly occupied by the Cartwheel Casino & Liquor Store at 1900 10th Avenue South. Chipotle is a fast-casual restaurant that serves burritos tacos salads and more and has locations in Kalispell Missoula Bozeman and Billings. Tom Micuda deputy director of the city Planning & Community Development department said the planning documents were filed two days ago. There is no word yet on when the new restaurant is scheduled to open. The existing Cartwheel building was demolished within the last few days but the unique Cartwheel sign is still standing at this point.

PANDA EXPRESS: A second Panda Express is in the works for Great Falls. Planning documents submitted to the city state that it will be built at the West Bank Landing development along 3rd Street NW in between Jersey Mike’s sub shop and the Verizon store. The first Panda Express in Great Falls opened in early 2018 and is located in the parking lot of the east-side Walmart.

Panda Express will be just south of the Verizon store

INDEPENDENCE BANK/TRUE BREW: The new building is nearly complete near the intersection of River Drive North and 9th Street. The three-story building will be Independence Bank  and will also feature a True Brew coffee shop. Independence Bank is based in Havre. The new location is scheduled to open later this month.

Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Chicago has been around for 125 years and acted as the primary church for three surrounding neighborhoods of Ashland Avenue.

The church held its first mass in October 1892 and was physically moved in 1929.

It took the efforts of 50 men and their horses to pry the 10000 ton church from its foundation move it across the street and rotate it 90 degrees. According to a Chicago Ancestry site the church was moved at a 'foot a minute.'

'It is a magnificent historically and architecturally significant church' said church preservation advocate Julie Sawacki on the steps leading to the church's entrance. 'Imagine tearing something so significant down.'

The church in its present form was built in 1916 and moved across a street by 50 men and horses in 1929

The Archdiocese of Chicago told CBS News that attendance at the church's Sunday masses have steadily declined.

The church simultaneously needs $2 million worth of repairs and without the community's support its likely it will be demolished.

There are a group of parishioners including Hilda Correa who are desperately trying to save the famed religious landmark. Correa and others say the church attracts tourists both Christian and non-Christian.

Correa also alluded to the fact that times are hard. Although she didn't specify what she was talking about - perhaps the years-long pandemic or stubborn inflation - Correa says the church is a place of comfort for those who come to visit.

Hilda Correa left and Julie Sawacki right as well as a number of others passionate about keeping Our Lady of Lourdes alive made impassioned pleas on the steps of the church before its last service on May 19

'The religious aspect is really what's really touching us because losing such a valuable place that people can come especially in these days...'

Our Lady of Lourdes will be holding its final service on May 19 but Preservation Chicago a non-profit organization dedicated to saving city landmarks plans to revive the church and make it into a holy shrine.

'The effort here will probably be long and labored perhaps. There's a lot of different moving parts and a lot of different factors' said Preservation Chicago Executive Director Ward Miller.

There is a Change.org petition with 1107 signatures to preserve the church as a historical landmark rather than knocking it down. The goal is to reach 1500 signatures.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c3Jvb20uY2h1cmNob2ZqZXN1c2NocmlzdC5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZS9jaHVyY2gtb2YtamVzdXMtY2hyaXN0LXJlc3BvbmRzLXRvLW1ham9yLWZsb29kaW5nLWluLXJpby1ncmFuZGUtZG8tc3VsLWJyYXppbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Church of Jesus Christ Responds to Major Flooding in Rio Grande Do Sul Brazil,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /article/church-of-jesus-christ-responds-to-major-flooding-in-rio-grande-do-sul-brazil (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D835452A0>, 'Connection to newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org timed out.

Kaitlyn Fisher was charged with three counts of felony grand theft on May 3.

Court documents say on Oct. 14 2022 an employee of the Presbytery of Kendall reported that Fisher the administrative clerk had been embezzling from church funds.

The Presbytery of Kendall is an organization that oversees the Presbyterian churches in the eastern Idaho area. According to a church newsletter obtained by EastIdahoNews.com Fisher was the administrative executive assistant.

EastIdahoNews.com has attempted to contact the Presbytery of Kendall by phone and email for comment and we are awaiting their response.

The reporting party told police the staff had not met for annual financial review meetings since the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time she repeatedly asked Fisher who acted as a secretary and bookkeeper for a summary of the church organization’s financials.

In October 2022 the board of trustees chair obtained the organization’s bank statements after asking the banks directly.

In the statements the employees reportedly discovered “numerous unauthorized purchases and transfers out of both accounts via Venmo and Paypal as far back as 2020.”

The two employees confronted Fisher on Oct. 10 where she allegedly admitted to making the unauthorized transfers and purchases.

On Dec. 6 an Idaho Falls Police officer contacted Fisher about the allegations and she denied stealing the money.

Over a week later the officer contacted a criminal investigator with the Idaho State Tax Commission who was able to issue and serve subpoenas for Fisher’s PayPal and Venmo account records.

In the transaction history investigators discovered at least $338458 worth of unauthorized purchases made from Fishers account allegedly using church funds between January 2019 and October 2022.

According to police reports Fisher used the money to buy a red 2018 Honda 4-wheeler from Action Motor Sports to pay The Yard Butler a local landscape designer and debited between $280890.01 and $281474 from the church organization’s Wells Fargo account.

Venmo account records showed Fisher’s Venmo account was linked to the church’s Wells Fargo account as a payment method for transactions.

Transaction descriptions further show Fisher allegedly used the money to pay for child care furniture a dog dog waste cleanup food gasoline her mortgage and supplies/labor to finish the basement of her new house.

Between July and October 2022 alone Fisher allegedly spend at least $38801.84 from the church’s Idaho Central Credit Union account.

A warrant was issued for Fisher’s arrest on May 3 and she was booked into the Bonneville County Jail on May 7. Her bail was set to $30000. She posted bond and was released on the same day.

Fisher is expected to appear for a preliminary hearing on May 29. If convicted she could face up to 42 years in prison.

Though Fisher has been charged with these crimes it does not necessarily mean she committed them. Everyone is presumed innocent until they are proven guilty."

Scams are rampant in today’s world in health care and other areas. While anyone of any age can be targeted older adults are particularly at risk. The overwhelming majority of fraud victims are seniors and their losses totaled more than $1.5 billion in 2021.

“Scammers are constantly coming up with new ways to target people using personal tactics to deceive their intended victims” said Blake Amos who oversees customer retention and experience with Cigna's Medicare Advantage business. “With that in mind it’s important for older people and their caregivers to learn how to sniff out suspicious activity including with their health care coverage” he said. Read on for his tips on ways to avoid being victimized.

1. Verify Callers’ Identity

Be on guard when the phone rings and your insurance company seems to be on the line. Scammers can sound official they may have personal information such as your name and address and they may invent a reason that makes you think you need to act immediately. Never feel that you must release personal information over the phone particularly to an unknown caller and don’t let callers intimidate you.

Medicare and Medicare Advantage plans must have your permission to call you. Even when that’s the case be alert to the possibility of fraud – many callers are not who they seem and they may have manipulated the caller ID feature to make the call look like it came from your insurance company. If you suspect a scam hang up and call your insurer using the phone number on the back of your customer identification card.

2. Guard Your ID Card

Protect your Medicare ID just like you safeguard your credit cards and Social Security card. Don’t believe callers who promise you something in exchange for your Medicare card number – this is a common scam.

When you’re out and about don’t show your Medicare ID to obtain information or anything else at public events like health fairs. If something is advertised as “free” you shouldn’t have to provide your insurance card. And finally never let anyone else use your card to obtain health care – that is against the law.

3. Get What You Pay For

Your insurer provides statements in the mail or online (or both) whenever you use a covered health care service. Look carefully at each of these statements to ensure they reflect your visit accurately. To help you remember keep a calendar of your visits with notes about what occurred during each one. If an insurance statement includes a visit or service you didn’t receive notify your provider immediately and/or call the number on the back of your insurance card. You can also call 1-800 MEDICARE (1.800.633.4227).

4. Be Alert Online

While many older adults are adept at using the internet phone apps and other digital tools others are less comfortable with technology. No matter how much or little time you spend online always approach the internet with caution. Don’t overshare on social media sites. Information like your birth date city where you were born and the names of family members – commonly requested in “fun” quizzes on Facebook and other social media sites – can be used to figure out your passwords or steal your identity.

Also be wary of unsolicited emails. Just as scammers can “spoof” phone numbers to make you think a call is from someone you know they can copy logos and language that make their emails look official. Compare the email address with the sender’s name to see if they match look for misspellings and never click on embedded links in an email unless you are certain the sender is legitimate.

5. Be Aware of Fake Medication Scams

Many older adults take multiple medications making them particularly vulnerable to the growing counterfeit drug industry that operates online. These fraudulent drugs look authentic but may contain the wrong ingredients incorrect quantities or no active ingredients – any of which can be harmful to your health. To avoid this possibility be careful of offers that seem too good to be true and make sure you are using a licensed pharmacy. If you need guidance your insurer or your doctor’s office can connect you with a pharmacy and identify ways to safely maximize your benefits.

Eight Words to Remember

These five tips can be summed up in eight words: Always remain alert and protect your personal information.

“We all want to assume the best intentions of others” Amos said. “We don’t want to become jaded or be too cynical but we don’t want to be a victim either. It’s perfectly acceptable to be a little skeptical of strangers to potentially avoid pain and aggravation down the road.”

If you think you have been the victim of Medicare or other health care fraud report it immediately by contacting your insurance company or state insurance fraud bureau. You can also call the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ tips hot line at 1.800.HHS.TIPS (1.800.447.8477) or HHSTips@oig.hhs.gov.

“By doing so you can play an important role in helping to cut health care costs for everyone and you might even be able to prevent others from becoming victims” Amos said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvYnJ1Y2VqYXBzZW4vMjAyMi8wOC8wNC9jaWduYXMtZXZlcm5vcnRoLWFuZC1oZWFsdGgtcGxhbi1ncm93dGgtcHVzaC1wcm9maXRzLXRvLTE2LWJpbGxpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cigna's Evernorth And Health Plan Growth Push Profits To $1.6 Billion,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2022/08/04/cignas-evernorth-and-health-plan-growth-push-profits-to-16-billion/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvYnJ1Y2VqYXBzZW4vMjAyMi8wOC8wNC9jaWduYXMtZXZlcm5vcnRoLWFuZC1oZWFsdGgtcGxhbi1ncm93dGgtcHVzaC1wcm9maXRzLXRvLTE2LWJpbGxpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdGluZy5jb20vbmV3cy9zdG9jay1tYXJrZXQtbmV3cy9jaWduYS1jb3JwLXNoYXJlcy1yYWxseS1hZnRlci1yYWlzaW5nLXByb2ZpdC1vdXRsb29rLTQzMlNJLTI4NjM4MTbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cigna Corp Shares Rally After Raising Profit Outlook,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/cigna-corp-shares-rally-after-raising-profit-outlook-432SI-2863816 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdGluZy5jb20vbmV3cy9zdG9jay1tYXJrZXQtbmV3cy9jaWduYS1jb3JwLXNoYXJlcy1yYWxseS1hZnRlci1yYWlzaW5nLXByb2ZpdC1vdXRsb29rLTQzMlNJLTI4NjM4MTbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZWhlYWx0aGNhcmUuY29tL3BheWVycy93aGljaC1pbnN1cmVyLXdhcy1tb3N0LXByb2ZpdGFibGUtcTItYW5zd2VyLXdvbnQtc3VycHJpc2UteW910gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Which insurer was most profitable in Q2? The answer won't surprise you,"Another quarter is on the books for major national insurers and the most profitable company through the first six months of this year isn't likely to be a surprise.

UnitedHealth Group continues to be a financial juggernaut through two quarters leading the charge in revenues and profit for the first half of 2022. The healthcare giant brought in $160.5 billion in revenue across Q1 and Q2 this year as well as $10.1 billion in profit.

Its next-closest competitor CVS Health earned $5.2 billion in profit for H1 according to company earnings reports. It's a closer second on revenue however with $157.5 billion for the first six months of this year.

In the second quarter specifically UnitedHealth is again the most profitable earning $5.1 billion. However CVS just edges it out for revenue bringing $80.6 billion to UHG's $80.3 billion. CVS earned $2.95 billion in profit for Q2 the second highest among the six national payers we tracked.

UnitedHealth Group and CVS Health are by far the most vertically integrated companies among the six major national payers with each encompassing a sprawling enterprise with a slew of diverse businesses under its umbrella. At UnitedHealth for instance Optum has repeatedly posted double-digit growth and executives said they believe the business arm has plenty of ""untapped potential"" still to find.

In particular Optum's provider services arm Optum Health is a major growth engine within the company and UnitedHealth has made multiple acquisitions this year alone to bring additional docs into the fold.

Aetna has also grown steadily since it joined CVS Health in late 2018 but the company also brings in significant cash from its retail pharmacies and pharmacy benefit manager Caremark. But CVS is taking a cue from its rival and looking to bulk out its healthcare services including the potential for a primary care acquisition sometime this year.

As Optum continues to grow competitors are starting to take lessons from UnitedHealth Group's success.

Cigna beats out Elevance Health formerly Anthem to be the third-highest revenue earner in both Q2 and H1 2022 but falls short of its rival on profitability. Much of Cigna's revenue growth over the past several quarters is attributable to Evernorth the sister company to its health plan that includes a major national PBM Express Scripts telehealth services data analytics and more.

Elevance Health too rebranded earlier this year as it looks to grow beyond simply being a health plan and instead a ""lifetime trusted partner"" in its members' health.

Cigna reported $45.4 billion in revenue for the second quarter and $89.5 billion in the first half of the year. Anthem brought in $38.6 billion in revenue for Q2 and $76.7 billion in H1 revenue.

Elevance Health meanwhile earned $1.7 billion in profit for Q2 and $3.5 billion in profit through the first six months of 2022. Cigna earned $1.6 billion in the second quarter and $2.7 billion in the first half of the year.

Five of the six major insurers did post profits in the second quarter with only Centene reporting a $172 million loss. The government insurer is profitable for the first half of the year however earning $677 million through the first two quarters of the year.

Centene is in the middle of the pack on revenue both in the second quarter and in the first half of the year according to its earnings reports. The company brought in $39.5 billion in revenue for Q2 and $73.1 billion in revenue through the first six months of 2022.

Humana beats out Centene in profitability but lands in sixth place for revenues according to its earnings report. The insurer reported $23.7 billion in revenue for the quarter and $696 million in profit. For the first half of the year it brought in $47.6 billion in revenue and $1.6 billion in profit.

Echoing other competitors in the market alongside its earnings Humana announced a plan to consolidate its operations into an insurance services arm as well as a healthcare services arm CenterWell. Humana has made multiple acquisitions of late to bulk up CenterWell most notably its buy of Kindred at Home which made it the largest provider of home health services in the United States.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbG9yYWRvbWVzYS5lZHUvbm93LzIwMjIvMDgvY29tbXVuaXR5LWdlbmVyb3NpdHktZmlsbHMtdGhlLWJ1c2luZXNzLWNsb3NldC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Community Generosity Fills The Business Closet | CMUnow,"CMU receives outpouring of support for student-run initiative

When CMU student and Accounting Club President LeighAnn Norton realized that so many students declined to attend the annual Meet the Firms networking event with local business leaders — just because they didn’t have the right attire — she decided to do something about it. She knew of an organization elsewhere that raised money to purchase one brand new outfit per student and decided to create a similar initiative with a twist. Passionate about environmental sustainability and not wanting to limit the number of outfits per student Norton envisioned a system to collect and distribute second-hand clothing and went in search of staff advisors fellow students and community partners to make it happen.

Director of Career Services Sadye Saad and COSI Admissions & Advising Coach Stephanie Parsons led Norton and fellow business student Olivia Pulford through the process of organizing a student committee budgeting and courting sponsors. The initiative which was named The Business Closet received an outpouring of support from community partners and CMU stakeholders in its first three months and is steadily building momentum as the official launch date approaches.

Over 200 pieces of clothing were donated by Heirlooms for Hospice Mor Storage Sales CMU Trustee Kasia Iwaniczko MacLeod and CMU Trustee Amy Lentz while $9000 in sponsorships have been donated by Cigna Timberline Bank and Dalby Wendland & Co. P.C.

The committee plans to expand this initiative to include all kinds of industry-specific clothing for the jobs CMU and WCCC train students to do and will set up multiple racks on both campuses.

“We are so excited to see this vision come to life and make professional clothing readily available to all students. Timberline Bank is grateful to be able to support our local students and reinvest in their futures” said Hannah Ellis Timberline Bank marketing specialist.

The Palisade Grand Junction Fruita and Western Colorado Latino Chambers of Commerce will kickoff the official launch of The Business Closet September 1 at 9am with a ribbon cutting ceremony at the Davis School of Business. The Maverick Job Fair will follow immediately on The Plaza from 10am-2pm and racks of clothing will be available for students to browse and try on at the Career Services booth. This is also the The Business Closet’s first official clothing drive and community members are encouraged to bring gently-used office

attire and accessories to donate. A curbside “fill the rack” station will be set up near the Rugby Pitch for convenient drive up donations.

“To our founding sponsors of The Business Closet — Cigna Timberline Bank and Dalby Wendland & Co P.C. — thank you for your contribution to our vision and thank you for showing me what it means to be a part of a community” said CMU student Olivia Pulford who is on the committee.

James Walker 54 brings more than 30 years of restaurant senior restaurant management experience to his new job including previous roles at Nathan's Famous Subway Johnny Rockets and Baja Fresh. Most recently he was CEO of a New York-based grocery startup BUYK.

Speaking to The Enquirer Walker admitted inflation and the lingering COVID-19 pandemic mean a choppy environment for the restaurant industry but stressed he wants Frisch's to play to its strengths – and customer favorites.

""We're not going to re-engineer the tartar sauce"" Walker said. ""I haven't been brought in to look at spreadsheets and manage costs. This is about growth.""

Walker said he plans to keep Frisch's iconic menu items but indicated he's looking to expand it with items core customers have expressed interest in and that might attract new ones.

Born in Wisconsin Walker grew up in Florida after his father moved there for work. He first ate at Frisch's during several family road trips growing up as his parents visited relatives back in Wisconsin.

""(Frisch's) hot fudge cake just takes me back to being young"" Walker said.

Walker is the first CEO of Frisch's since predecessor Jason Vaughn left in May 2021. Tony Vasconcellos then served as president and chief financial officer but left the company three months ago.

Last year Frisch's said it is ""undergoing a reorganization"" as it tries to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic after closing more than half a dozen stores in 2020.

A beloved 75-year old chain that has struggled to grow Frisch's was acquired by an Atlanta private equity firm NRD Capital in 2015 for $175 million. The company operates more than 100 restaurants in Ohio Kentucky and Indiana.

In the years after the takeover Frisch's modernized (and slimmed down) the iconic Big Boy mascot and updated the look of restaurants with a more open design. The company also reversed a 2013 switch from Coke to Pepsi products.

“Fewer and fewer restaurant brands today have the kind of legacy that Frisch’s Big Boy has. The people of Cincinnati and surrounding areas have an emotional connection with this brand” Walker said in a statement.

The most critical of the flaws impact Cisco Small Business RV160 RV260 RV340 and RV345 Series routers. Tracked as CVE-2022-20842 (CVSS score: 9.8) the weakness stems from an insufficient validation of user-supplied input to the web-based management interface of the appliances.

""An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP input to an affected device"" Cisco said in an advisory. ""A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system or cause the device to reload resulting in a DoS condition.""

A second shortcoming relates to a command injection vulnerability residing in the routers' web filter database update feature (CVE-2022-20827 CVSS score: 9.0) which could be exploited by an adversary to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with root privileges.

The third router-related flaw to be resolved (CVE-2022-20841 CVSS score: 8.0) is also a command injection bug in the Open Plug-n-Play (PnP) module that could be abused by sending a malicious input to achieve code execution on the targeted Linux host.

""To exploit this vulnerability an attacker must leverage a man-in-the-middle position or have an established foothold on a specific network device that is connected to the affected router"" the networking equipment maker noted.

Also patched by Cisco are five medium security flaws affecting Webex Meetings Identity Services Engine Unified Communications Manager and BroadWorks Application Delivery Platform.

The company offered no workarounds to remediate the issues adding there is no evidence of these vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild. That said customers are recommended to move quickly to apply the updates.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ldHdvcmt3b3JsZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS85NzEzMjQvY2lzY28tc2hha2V1cC1uZXR3b3JraW5nLWNoaWVmLXRvZGQtbmlnaHRpbmdhbGUtdG8taGVsbS1mYXN0bHkuaHRtbNIBdGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ldHdvcmt3b3JsZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS85NzEzMjQvY2lzY28tc2hha2V1cC1uZXR3b3JraW5nLWNoaWVmLXRvZGQtbmlnaHRpbmdhbGUtdG8taGVsbS1mYXN0bHkuaHRtbC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cisco shakeup: Networking chief Todd Nightingale to helm Fastly,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.networkworld.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /article/971324/cisco-shakeup-networking-chief-todd-nightingale-to-helm-fastly.html (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D82B99D20>, 'Connection to www.networkworld.com timed out.

The Wall Street bank on Thursday disclosed $8.4 billion in Russia exposure as of June 30 compared with $7.9 billion at the end of the first quarter.

Citi said it had cut down on loans and cash on deposits in the country particularly those from its institutional clients group but that was offset by the rouble's more than 40% surge in the quarter.

The rouble has become the world's best-performing currency this year boosted by Russia's high proceeds from commodity exports a sharp drop in imports and a ban on households withdrawing foreign currency savings after the invasion of Ukraine in February.

Citigroup has been looking to exit sanctions-hit Russia and is in talks with Russian private lender Expobank over a possible sale of some of its operations in the country Reuters reported last month.

Nikhil Taneja is now head of corporate development at Inshorts Group which operates content distribution tech platforms across India the US UK UAE Canada and Southeast Asia.

Taneja had been with Goldman for almost 10 years latterly as head of technology investment banking for Southeast Asia according to his LinkedIn profile. After joining GS in India he held several roles at the US firm in Hong Kong and Singapore with a focus on technology media and telecommunications (TMT).

At Inshorts Taneja is leading corporate development M&A investor relations and fundraising.

As technology firms expand their headcounts in Singapore using the city state as a beachhead to Southeast Asian markets technology sector bankers like Taneja are well placed to take on corporate development roles.

Making the move in-house is appealing to some bankers because the hours are potentially shorter and there’s the opportunity to help build a business and the prospect of a large pay-out in the event of an initial public offering.

By contrast in Hong Kong – where the brain drain to the corporate sector began years earlier – some TMT dealmakers are now returning to banking. Morgan Stanley recently hired the former director of corporate finance at Alibaba Henry Tsai to run its internet investment banking team for APAC for example.

Between 2008 and 2016 Philly lost 13000 lower-cost housing units per data from the City’s Housing Action Plan. The city’s recent spate of construction and development has largely left out low-income residents. According to the report as affordable housing — defined as costing no more than 30 percent of a resident’s income — declined 6000 higher-end units were built over the same period.

In Philly the affordable housing crisis is worsened not just by a dearth of stock but also by median costs: More than half of the city’s renters and about 40 percent of residents as a whole spend more than 30 percent on housing costs.

In the midst of this crisis Mohamed “Mo” Rushdy has emerged as an unlikely hero. The Egypt-born former Kuwait Olympic Stadium engineer-turned Toll Brothers wunderkind began building workforce housing — homes priced for middle-income citizens — when he co-founded the real estate development firm Riverwards Group with Lawrence “Larry” McKnight in 2009.

Now he’s turned his attention to the city’s affordable housing crisis as both the vice president of the Building Industry Association of Philadelphia and chair of the board of directors for the newly created Philadelphia Accelerator Fund (PAF) a public-private partnership formed to provide flexible loans to Black and Brown developers so that they can build affordable housing.

Over the next five years PAF plans to raise more than $100 million with the intention of constructing 6000 affordable housing units. Currently the fund is trying to raise between $10 to $15 million by the end of the year with the goal of giving their first loans out in early 2023.

“We have a city that sits on a wealth of vacant public land of mostly infill lots that can get two-story single family three-bedroom two-bathroom homes with backyards on them” says Rushdy.

“My vision is getting 10000 families in single-family two-story three-bedroom two-bathroom homes over the next eight years costing $600 to $1300 per month in total monthly housing cost for a single family — an opportunity that would create $200000 to $250000 in wealth for each of these 10000 families” Rushdy says.

For his work in building better places for all Philadelphians to live and building pathways for under-represented developers to thrive Rushdy is a Generation Change Philly fellow.

From Cairo to GradHo



Growing up in Egypt Rushdy spent his early years accompanying his father an engineer to job sites. He and his brother would sometimes wake up as early as 5 a.m. to tag along with their dad as he worked on homes and bridges. Watching as his father worked on these projects and thinking about how they were constructed just felt natural to him. “I’d spend a whole day there” he recalls.

Though real estate development had always been part of his life Rushdy dreamt of being a doctor and applied and was accepted to medical schools after graduating high school at age 15. (In Egypt students attend seven years of medical school rather than going to college first). He also put in an application to the American University of Cairo engineering school. When he got into both he decided to attend both. But as he sat through his medical school classes all he could think about was engineering. “After the first couple of weeks I was like I think I really want to be there not here” he says.

He began skipping medical school classes. By the end of the first year he officially chose engineering.

Upon graduation Rushdy worked on a number of infrastructure cement plant and stadium building projects in the Middle East. One job: Kuwait’s first Olympic Stadium. In 2004 he moved to San Francisco to get his start in residential development. He joined luxury home developer Toll Brothers — best known for their suburban McMansion developments — enrolling in their one-year assistant project manager-in-training program the first in the company’s series of rungs up the corporate ladder.

But Rushdy showed so much promise Toll Bros pulled him out of training after three months and had him take on a 128-unit single-family development in the East Bay. Within 18 months he was a senior project manager.

Shortly after his promotion Rushy and his wife a foreign-trained dentist moved to Philadelphia so she could attend a program at the University of Pennsylvania that would allow her to practice in the U.S. Continuing with Toll Brothers he led phase one of the Naval Square condo development in Graduate Hospital — and cemented his place in the local building community.

“That was an early win coming here as an immigrant and within a couple years moving up in the company” he says.

Like many talented young professionals Rushdy found his skills were in demand. In 2007 Westrum Development Company recruited him as a general manager. His next big project became The Arbors at Eagle Pointe a 400-home active adult community in far Northeast Philly. When the recession hit in 2008 Westrum placed Rushdy in charge of all Philadelphia developments. In 2011 they asked him to head up acquisitions.

Reviving Fishtown

Though he remained gainfully employed at Westrum Rushdy began to look into other opportunities locally. He’d been talking with McKnight then a colleague and friend at Westrum about some small infill projects McKnight had been building in Fishtown and Northern Liberties buying a vacant lot or abandoned house and building something new.

Philadelphia’s seemingly endless stock of empty lots frustrated Rushdy. These vacant spaces felt like such a waste when so many local families needed good homes. “We have a city that sits on a wealth of vacant public land of mostly infill lots that can get two-story single family three-bedroom two-bathroom homes with backyards on them” he says.

For McKnight the issue was personal as well as professional. He’d grown up in a two-story Fishtown rowhome raised by parents who were a police officer and a teacher. He’d watched as the working-class neighborhood struggled in the ’80s and ’90s when it had more than 1100 vacant lots and was overrun with drug-related crime.

“He had seen these neighborhoods when they weren’t on the decline that they have gone through over decades” Rushdy says.

This was in 2009 before Fishtown was what it is today — a hip young neighborhood with bars restaurants coffee shops and retail galore. But Rushdy and McKnight saw the potential there. It was accessible via public transit with commercial corridors along Girard Frankford Avenue and Front Street and neighboring 2nd Street in Northern Liberties.

“We knew we were onto something big a future that holds true change in these neighborhoods” Rushdy says.

But they also knew that they wanted to do things differently than other developers coming to the area. Both Rushdy and McKnight had worked on higher-end residential projects. Toll Brothers’ Naval Square for example is in Graduate Hospital the city’s most gentrified neighborhood. They didn’t want to repeat that to contribute to raising housing prices throughout the neighborhood.

“This area is unique in what it can offer to a person that wants to live in the city and you know doesn’t want to live in a $2000-a-month 600-square-feet studio” Rushdy says.

So they focused on building safe fairly-priced housing for middle-income families making $60000 a year families like McKnight’s. This gave them a wide group of potential customers which the pair believed would help sustain their company in the long term.

“People don’t care about the politics. They just want stable clean and new housing in their neighborhoods”says Rushdy.

“We have extreme discipline on who we are and want to approach what we want and what projects that we can do” says Rushdy. “Getting bullish overpaying for land and really raising prices — that’s just not us. We always joke and say We’re not the ones that make the money. The ones that come right behind us are the ones that make money.”

While still at Westrum the duo made their partnership official by launching Riverwards Group.​​ They slowly scaled up McKnight’s sideline operation purchasing an empty lot or distressed homes to build on. “We had managed 400-unit jobs 800-unit jobs” Rushdy says “Getting a four- or five-unit job was pretty simple.”

Riverwards started out building five homes per year. By 2020 five had grown to 130. To date Rushdy and McKnight have completed 519 houses with over 1000 more units in development. Their projects have expanded beyond Fishtown into East and South Kensington Port Richmond and beyond the Riverwards to Roxborough and Francisville.

Building for better

Though he had found success building infills and larger developments in the Riverwards Rushdy remained frustrated with the state of affordable housing in the city (again defined as a residence that costs its occupant 30 percent or less of their income).

The process of getting vacant land from the City’s Land Bank was cumbersome. Zoning policies had created what Rushdy calls “development deserts” throughout Philly.

“We do indeed have a crisis when it comes to affordable housing. It’s a solvable one though. It’s largely manufactured due to bad policy. Affordable housing got politicized in our city” he says. But “People don’t care about the politics. They just want stable clean and new housing in their neighborhoods.”

So Rushdy did what he does what has been in his genes since he first started accompanying his father to construction sites: He started building.

Riverwards Group sold its first workforce-priced development in 2017 at the corner of Marshall and Poplar streets in East Poplar: 13 three-story rowhomes at $229900 each went to families who earned no more than 120 percent of the area’s median income. They followed up with a similar development of 16 three-bedroom homes in Francisville. A development of 15 homes is currently in the works in Port Richmond.

And he started lobbying the city. Rushdy’s experience creating workforce and affordable housing brought him to the attention of the Building Industry Association of Philadelphia (BIA) where he’s currently serving as vice president. Rushdy and BIA current president Gary Jonas worked with a housing committee that helped advise City Council on the 2018 Housing Action Plan. “We’re for-profit guys who understand the numbers and know how we can resolve issues for the City especially on the affordable housing scale” Rushdy says.

Introduced in 2018 the Housing Action Plan calls for building 3650 new units each year at price points across the income spectrum. Mayor Kenney has pledged at least $53 million in affordable housing funding as part of the plan and supports legislation that would bring in an additional $18 million.

So Rushdy did what he does what has been in his genes since he first started accompanying his father to construction sites: He started building.

Under Rushdy and Jonas the BIA helped the City shepherd a new process for selling vacant City-owned land to developers. Under the new system both nonprofit and for-profit developers can submit proposals and be awarded vacant lots from the City’s Land Bank — provided the proposal turns 51 percent of the project into affordable units. These sort of proposals essentially trigger a noncompetitive sales process with the City rather than waiting for the Land Bank to put a group of lots together and call for a RFP.

“That legislation allows companies to go in and say Hey listen I like these 20 parcels and I’m gonna put 11 affordable housing because that’s over 50 percent and the other nine on market” Rushdy says. “It’s very groundbreaking legislation.”

Soon after Greg Heller then executive director of the Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority approached Rushdy to ask him to join the board of Philadelphia Accelerator Fund (PAF) a fund meant to help Black and Brown developers take advantage of the new noncompetitive Land Bank sales process.

The PAF took its inspiration from the San Francisco Housing Accelerator Fund which helps nonprofit affordable housing developers compete with market-rate developers by offering flexible loans to buy land. The Philly fund’s goals differ slightly however. It hopes to provide flexible financing for affordable housing projects with a focus on providing funds to Black and Brown developers who often face systemic barriers due to discriminatory lending practices among traditional banking institutions.

So far the fund seeded with about $11 million from the City has raised an additional $10 million from Citizens Bank and Univest. As chair of the board of directors Rushdy has been heavily involved working with interim executive director Jojy Varghese to create an accessible online application for developers interested in applying for loans. Rushdy has not missed a single presentation from investors or lenders looking to be involved.

“Mo has been instrumental in advancing the goals of PAF through his vision experience and expertise in the regional affordable housing environment” Varghese says.

When the PAF were testing the loan application Varghese had both Rushdy and a young developer submit projects. The goal was to create a system that would filter out applications from developers like Rushdy — experienced builders with easy access to capital.

Rushdy plans to continue working with the fund and to keep mentoring developers who are interested in building affordable housing in Philly. One of his mentees is currently working on an application for a PAF loan.

Varghese believes the vision is more than practicable. “This fund in particular isn’t going to be helping the people like Mo who are already established” Varghese says. “This fund will be helping primarily Black and Brown developers get to the point of where Mo currently is.”

Correction: A previous version of this story misstated that Gary Jonas was a member of the Philadelphia Accelerator Fund.

The Philadelphia Citizen is partnering with the nonprofit Keepers of the Commons on the “Generation Change Philly” series to provide educational and networking opportunities to the city’s most dynamic change-makers.

Don and Ellie Knauss cut ribbon to new home of the Knauss School of Business

The Knauss School of Business has a new home.

The Knauss Center for Business Education officially opened Thursday afternoon following a ribbon cutting ceremony that featured University of San Diego Board Chairman Don Knauss the former CEO of Clorox and his wife Ellie.

In December 2021 the couple increased their philanthropic giving to the university to $50 million to help fund construction of the new facility. In honor of the gift—one of the largest in USD history—the business school was named the Knauss School of Business.

More than 100 members of the USD community including top administrators trustees staff students and alumni gathered around the fountain in Paseo de Colachis to view the ceremonial opening of the 120000-square-foot building. Together with the recently renovated Olin Hall the new complex has more than tripled the size of the university’s 50-year-old business school.

Standing before the steps leading to the building’s polished stone archway entrance Don and Ellie enthusiastically offered their unwavering support for USD.

“We believe in the leadership of this university and we believe that talent is everywhere but opportunity is not” said Don addressing the crowd below an overcast August sky. “We think this investment is going to create opportunities for a lot of talented students from all walks of life for generations to come.”

“To us this day is the culmination of our core belief that education is the great equalizer” Ellie said. “We know that this school the Knauss School of Business and this world-class facility are going to provide young adults the ability to maximize their God given talents. They are going to ensure that we confront humanity’s most urgent challenges and do it with loving hearts.”

In April 2021 the university broke ground on the Knauss Center for Business Education and the renovation of the 37-year-old Olin Hall. The school had long outgrown the space and its faculty staff and programs have most recently resided in six different buildings across campus.

“Today we sit at the steps of a vision and a dream that was well over 20 years in the making and today we recognize that visions — and dreams — can become a reality” said Vice President of University Operations Ky Snyder who served as event emcee. “Today with the Knauss family we get to celebrate the opening of the Knauss Center for Business Education and the Knauss School of Business.""

“This has been an incredible effort by literally hundreds of people enabled by individuals who are here today” said Tim Kean PhD dean of the Knauss School of Business. “Inside what I call the ‘innovation and collaboration ecosystem’ we have state-of-the-art spaces. It’s designed the way business today and in the future is supposed to work — it’s open [and] it’s collaborative.""

Following the cutting of the ceremonial blue ribbon guests were invited inside for the first time to explore the numerous spaces which include flexible classrooms student support services finance and analytics labs innovation and entrepreneurship spaces the Nexus Theater and team collaboration pods.

“Collaboration at least in my career certainly was the key to progress” said Don standing beside Ellie inside the new theater space. “Collaboration leads to innovation leads to progress. I think that’s what is going to be fostered in this facility.”

“To me a lot of the collaboration is the friendships and connections that are made continued Ellie. “That is what really prepares you to be successful in business.”

With just weeks until the start of the new school year Don had a message for current and future students of the Knauss School of Business: be fully engaged and utilize the resources available.

“You have got a combination of world-class technology world-class faculty and now this incredibly inspiring structure to work and learn in so take full advantage of it.""

The latest losses accelerated following U.S. data showing crude and gasoline stockpiles unexpectedly surged last week and OPEC+ said it would raise its oil output target by 100000 barrels per day. Light sweet crude fell nearly 4% to just above $90 per barrel. That is the first time oil closed below $91 per barrel since Russia invaded Ukraine.

The Energy Information Administration (EIA) also said domestic jet and motor fuel consumption declined 19% and 7.6% respectively from the week before. Gasoline futures in New York dropped nearly 5% to $2.91 per gallon the lowest point since late February.

The drop in crude oil prices has led to a substantial drop in the retail price of gasoline. After hitting record high prices in June average gas prices have fallen for 50 straight days and are now approaching $4 per gallon. The national average price of regular unleaded gasoline is now $4.14 per gallon. That is a 17% decline from the previous high of $5.02 per gallon set back on June 14.

Whether gas prices continue to move lower could depend on several factors including potential hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico that would force refineries offline as well as unanticipated disruptions from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Analysts say the price of gas could fall under $4 a gallon over the next two weeks if there are no disruptions.

""Crude oil futures according to the CME Group show prices trading between $85 to $95 per barrel through the December contracts which indicates that traders believe oil prices will remain relatively stable for the rest of the year. If they are correct then gas prices should continue to fall commensurately"" said Caleb Silver Editor-in-Chief of Investopedia.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vY2FyYm9uY3JlZGl0cy5jb20vcmVhbC12b2x1bnRhcnktY2FyYm9uLW1hcmtldC12YWx1ZS1pcy0yLWJpbGxpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Real Voluntary Carbon Market Value is $2 Billion,"The real value of the voluntary carbon market is now around $2 billion with rising price trends of ~170 types of carbon credits as per a recent Ecosystem Marketplace (EM) report.

EM a Forest Trends initiative has been tracking and reporting on the state of the VCM since 2006.

Their latest briefing reveals that the current VCM is almost $2 billion. And about 500 million carbon credits were traded in the same year surpassing the previous EM report by 66%.

Also global prices are climbing upwards by 60% more in 2021 ($4.0) than in 2020 ($2.5).

Lastly EM stated that there are over 170 types of carbon credits falling under 8 categories traded in 2020-2021.

Global Voluntary Carbon Market Value and Prices

The future of voluntary carbon markets (VCM) looked brighter as more interests and investments poured into carbon projects. Plus global climate and sustainability goals are driving record high demand.

The previous partial year report of EM indicated that VCM value is about $1 billion. But its recent and final brief stated that the real market value is nearly $2 billion.

The chart shows the VCM size by value of traded carbon credits from pre-2005 to year-ended 2021. The market’s total or cumulative value reaches $8 billion.

Likewise global carbon credit prices are also trending upwards.

The annual global average price per ton went up from $2.5 in 2020 to $4.0 in 2021. That represents about a 60% increase to a point never seen since 2013.

Among the eight categories of carbon credits prices for projects with non-carbon benefits are higher.

Non-carbon benefits refer to the co-benefits that a certain project provides. Examples are local community support and biodiversity conservation.

Alongside sustainable development goals the co-benefits are either integrated from the outset into carbon standards or bolted onto carbon credit projects with validated GHG emission reductions/removals.

In particular projects under Gold Standard (one of the major carbon standards) saw a 35% increase in price from 2020 ($3.7) to 2021 ($5.0).

Plan Vivo also recorded a higher price increase of 15% for the same period. The bulk of its transaction volume 79% was from projects under the category of Forestry and Land Use (Afforestation Reforestation and Revegetation or ARR).

The most common co-benefits certification standard in use today is the CCB (Climate Community & Biodiversity) Standards. It’s an add-on for Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) carbon credits that also jumped in volume by 277%.

The table below shows the overall VCM transaction volumes prices and values by category comparing 2020 and 2021 results.

Types and Categories of Project-Specific Carbon Credits

As the VCM matures more and more participants – project developers investors buyers regulators etc. – are shaping how the market works. They give different attributes and definitions to project-specific carbon credits.

As such EM tried to simplify things by giving an official Project ID for traded carbon credits data. This is important so that those attributes would be verifiable through the carbon standard that issues the credits.

The Forest Trends initiative also updated its Carbon Offset Project Typology in Q1 of 2022. These updates allowed EM to expand its list of project types covering 170+ projects.

All project types are then rolled up into 60 project clusters and narrowed down even further into 8 project categories.

The image illustrates EM’s 8 categories with specific examples of projects.

Another remarkable result reported by EM is that project specificity in trade reporting goes with higher voluntary carbon market value and prices.

It means carbon credits that were cross-referenced with carbon standards’ registries have higher prices than those that were not. Cross-referencing involves providing project-specific metrics for the credits like project name or ID.

Most interestingly the report suggested that the VCM prefers to buy and sell carbon credits via bilateral deals between project developers and end buyers the most .

That only shows that there are growing opportunities for project developers to respond to corporate requests for proposals.

But in the past years intermediaries and digital spot trading exchanges began to re-emerge into the VCM.

Futures exchanges (e.g. CME Group) are working with spot exchanges (e.g. CTX and ACX) to develop standardized contracts pegged to specific project attributes.

As more players and money are flooding the voluntary carbon market its value seems to grow even more.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFnd2ViLmNvbS9uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzL2Zhcm1sYW5kL2hlcmVzLXdoeS1idXlpbmctdXMtZmFybWxhbmQtanVzdC1iZWNhbWUtbW9yZS1leHBlbnNpdmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's Why Buying U.S. Farmland Just Became More Expensive,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.agweb.com/news/business/farmland/heres-why-buying-us-farmland-just-became-more-expensive on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFnd2ViLmNvbS9uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzL2Zhcm1sYW5kL2hlcmVzLXdoeS1idXlpbmctdXMtZmFybWxhbmQtanVzdC1iZWNhbWUtbW9yZS1leHBlbnNpdmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

India dropped its target of establishing 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030 giving itself the flexibility of 50% power from non-fossil fuel sources by then in its commitments to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This keeps India's options open for new coal-based power plants in the projected 820 GW total capacity if excess demand cannot be met from green fuels sources told ET.The Cabinet on Wednesday approved India's updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to be communicated to the UNFCCC. The updated NDC proposes about 50% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030 dropping the 500 GW absolute target committed at COP26. It also did not include the commitment to reduce one billion tonnes of carbon emission by 2030.India had made a commitment to generate 500 GW of power from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030 and reduce carbon emissions by one billion tonnes by the end of the decade at the COP26 conference held in Glasgow in November last year.The NDCs are the core of the Paris Agreement on climate change that countries have to communicate and update periodically. The updated NDC commits to reducing the emissions intensity of GDP by 45% by 2030 from the 2005 level not mentioning the one billion tonne carbon emission reduction.An official statement issued after the cabinet meeting reiterated India's long-term goal of reaching net zero by 2070.""The updated NDC has a flexible approach towards renewable energy generation that in reality depends upon power demand"" a senior government official told ET. ""If the demand for power is high the generation should be high rather than setting rigid targets.""It is however clear that 50% of the country's installed generation capacity will be based on non-fossil fuel sources including large hydro he said.Another official said the updated goals keep the window open for new thermal power plants.""As long as we keep the fossil below 50% we can raise the TPP (thermal power plant) capacity"" he said. ""In case demand is higher renewable energy can grow rapidly by 2030 accommodating more thermal capacity.""Power and renewable energy minister RK Singh recently said the country's installed capacity is expected to be 820 GW in 2030. In an interview with ET in May he said India is a big country and demand has only started growing now.""The industrialised countries have been using fossil fuel for their growth for the past many decades. Our first requirement is to make sure there is enough power available for growth. There is not going to be any compromise on that"" he said on being asked about halting new coal plants.India's current installed power capacity is 404 GW consisting of coal-based 204 GW (50%) renewable energy sources 114 GW (28%) and hydro 47 GW (12%). Nuclear power generation capacity is 7 GW gas-based power 24 GW and lignite and diesel-based 8 GW.The Central Electricity Authority has forecast that the country's reliance on coal will drop from 53% in 2021 to 33% in 2030 whereas solar and wind together will make up 51% from 23% in 2021. Coal contributes about 67% of the energy generation. However no new coal-based plants have been set up in the past decade. NTPC Ltd recently announced it would be setting up its first coal-fired plant in many years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9pbmRpYS1idXNpbmVzcy93aHktcnVzc2lhLWNhbnQtYmFuay1vbi1lbmVyZ3ktZXhwb3J0cy10by1pbmRpYS1jaGluYS9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85MzMzOTYxOC5jbXPSAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly90aW1lc29maW5kaWEuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvaW5kaWEtYnVzaW5lc3Mvd2h5LXJ1c3NpYS1jYW50LWJhbmstb24tZW5lcmd5LWV4cG9ydHMtdG8taW5kaWEtY2hpbmEvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93LzkzMzM5NjE4LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Russia can't bank on energy exports to India China,"<p>India spent $8.8 billion on petroleum and coal imports from February 24 to June 30 more than it doled out for all Russian goods for the entire year in 2021<br><br></p>

China spent $18.9 billion on Russian oil gas and coal in the three months to the end of May almost double the amount a year earlier latest customs data show

With inputs from Bloomberg

Even though India and China's spending on Russian energy imports have doubled this year Asia cannot fully absorb Moscow's shrinking oil and gas market according to a study by researchers at Yale University.China spent $18.9 billion on Russian oil gas and coal in the three months to the end of May almost double the amount a year earlier while India shelled out $5.1 billion in the same period more than five times the value of a year ago.Reports suggest that higher spending is helping make up for decreased purchases from the US and some other nations that have halted or slowed buying to punish Russia for the war.However Russia's crude shipments to China and India have fallen nearly 30% since they peaked after the war in Ukraine began. Since mid-June Russia's seaborne crude flows have declined on a rolling four-week average of exports calculated by Bloomberg. Flows have slipped to 3.24 million barrels a day leading up to July 15 seeing a dip in each of the prior four weeks.While flows to Asia have accounted for over half of Russia's total crude flows since Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine shipments to Asia hit their lowest four-week average in nearly four months in the lead-up to July 15.And despite Putin’s much-hyped “pivot to the East” to replace the lost erstwhile primary market in Europe Asian countries like India and China are driving a $35 discount with overflowing excess Russian oil  even though the historical spread has never ranged beyond $5—not even during the 2014 Crimean crisis according to Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld Founder & President Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute.""The marginally higher quantities of Russian oil being purchased by China and India are being purchased at a significant discount with Russian Urals oil trading at the largest discount to the Brent benchmark on record a whopping $35 price differential – even though Urals and Brent oil have largely traded at comparable prices prior to the invasion. Russia remains a relatively highcost producer relative to the other major oil producers – i.e. Saudi Arabia and the United States – and thus any margin pressure will be felt keenly by Russia. The Urals-Brent price differential would certainly widen even further if western allies successfully implement a potential price cap in the $40-$60 range as recently reported as China and India would likely drive an even harder bargain given the low floor"" noted the Yale report.As one of the world’s largest crude oil exporters with about 10% of the total market approximately 50-60% of its oil exports goes to OECD Europe while 20% goes to China. ""Russia faces existential challenges in its oil markets – with a rapidly dwindling set of global purchasers. Its isolation from the west has devastated Russia’s strategic hand in negotiating with China and India notoriously priceconscious buyers who retain close ties to other major commodity exporters. These countries have not been shy to exploit sanctioned pariah countries before with China notoriously driving massively discounted oil deals with countries such as Iran and Venezuela with regularity"" noted the Yale report.Moreover it takes Russian oil tankers an average of 35 days to reach East Asia versus two to seven days to reach Europe which is why historically only 39 percent of Russian oil has gone to Asia versus the 53 percent destined for EuropeAt the same time Russia can hardly re-direct piped natural gas away from Europe considering 90% of its existing pipeline infrastructure flows to Europe not Asia.The 16.5 billion cubic metres of gas exported by Russia to China last year is less than 10% of the 170 billion cubic metres of natural gas sent by Russia to the Europmean market.Since less than 10 percent of Russia’s gas capacity is liquefied natural gas so Russian gas exports remain reliant on a system of fixed pipelines carrying piped gas. The vast majority of Russia’s pipelines flow toward Europe; those pipelines which originate in western Russia are not connectable to a separate nascent network of pipelines that link Eastern Siberia to Asia which contains only 10 percent of the capacity of the European pipeline network.Also the Asian pipeline projects currently under construction are still years away from becoming operational and financing of these costly gas pipeline projects also now puts Russia at a significant disadvantage.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZXJneWZtLm5ldC9jbXMvbmV3c19zdG9yeV83MzI1MjkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Royal Manx shaping up to be a bumper event,"Royal Manx shaping up to be a bumper event

This year’s Royal Manx Agricultural Show is shaping up to be a bumper event.

The “Royal” will take place on Friday 12th and Saturday 13th August 2022 at Knockaloe in Patrick.

In addition to all the usual entertainment and exhibits this year’s event will feature a number of exciting acts from the UK as well as some off-Island judges following the removal of COVID restrictions in place last year.

New to the Show for the first time is the Land Rover Experience Display Team who will be offering passengers exhilarating rides as they put their trusty vehicles through a mobile course designed to make the vehicles show off their capabilities and get the passengers’ hearts racing.

Manx Telecom will be providing family entertainment for all: Isle of Play will be back to help youngsters play make things and use their imagination while there will be multi-player fun with Matrix in their virtual reality arena and various gaming experiences featuring the latest consoles and AR headsets in partnership with Energy FM.

Carol Kennaugh secretary of the Royal Manx Agricultural Society said it was wonderful to be able to once again organise the Show without the restraints of COVID and in particular to bring judges from off-Island to the event.

“Our exhibitors work long and hard to bring animals of an immensely high standard to the Show. Whilst we will still continue to use some locally-based judges we recognise how important it is to invite judges from off-Island to acknowledge the dedication of the exhibitors and the high standards they achieve.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL2J1c2luZXNzL3J1c3NpYS1iYW5zLXdlc3Rlcm4taW52ZXN0b3JzLWZyb20tc2VsbGluZy1iYW5raW5nLWtleS1lbmVyZ3ktc3Rha2VzL2FydGljbGVzaG93LzkzMzc2MTAwLmNtc9IBmQFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL2J1c2luZXNzL3J1c3NpYS1iYW5zLXdlc3Rlcm4taW52ZXN0b3JzLWZyb20tc2VsbGluZy1iYW5raW5nLWtleS1lbmVyZ3ktc3Rha2VzL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85MzM3NjEwMC5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Russia bans Western investors from selling banking key energy stakes,"It seems like you're already an ETPrime member with

I write to update you on the future shape of our business in Russia.

As we indicated in our Q1 trading update we are making significant changes to our Russian operations in response to the ongoing geopolitical crisis.

In close alignment with The Coca-Cola Company we have stopped all production and sales of brands of The Coca-Cola Company in Russia. There are no plans to reintroduce The Coca-Cola Company brands or products in any format.

Going forward we intend to have a much smaller operation in Russia which has been renamed Multon Partners. This will focus on the production and sale of existing local brands - Dobry Rich and Moya Semya - and raw materials will be sourced from within the market. It will be managed and operated locally.

Over the coming months Multon Partners will consider how best to establish itself which may include some extensions of existing local brands however no plans have been finalised.

We continue to support our colleagues and their communities in Ukraine and neighbouring countries however we can; through individual donations volunteering and the more than $18.5m donations committed by the Coca-Cola System globally.

We appreciate this is an incredibly challenging time for many of you and we want to thank you for your support during this period.

Baja Californians will soon be able to enjoy “La Última del Desierto” a soda shop whose theme is completely based on the Coca-Cola drink.

This establishment will be a soda shop located at Avenida Reforma in the corner of Morelos Street 21100 in Mexicali. Besides presenting a vintage look of this drink as their main theme they are also looking to revive the nostalgic essence of the 1950s and 1960s.

The soda fountain will have a food menu as well as a variety of drinks according to the social media of La Última del Desierto. They will also have products such as chilidogs snowballs fries the classic Coca-Cola drink and other edible products.

The soda shop concept as its name indicates is a shop where the main product that is consumed is soda. One of the first ones in Mexico opened in 1965 in Ciudad Madero Tamaulipas and was called Bum Bum. They played popular music of the time and was frequently visited by teenagers.

Coca-Cola was created in a lab by US chemist-pharmacist and army veteran John Stith Pemberton when he was trying to find a cure for diarrhea and nausea.

Since 1892 the Coca-Cola Company has been headquartered in Atlanta Georgia.

“The team chemistry is really good right now” Pugh told Just Women’s Sports on the set of Gatorade’s Beat the Heat shoot. “You have a mixture of veterans and rookies some players that don’t have as much experience. The vibe is good.”

Pugh isn’t the only one to have praised the team’s chemistry and pushed back at the notion that all is not well in the locker room. Following the USWNT’s Concacaf win midfielder Andi Sullivan called the team’s vibes throughout the tournament “really incredible.”

“I almost get emotional because the vibes with the team are really incredible” Sullivan said. “The blend between the senior leaders and the young players — for some it’s their first tournament or for some players this is their umpteenth tournament — and I think that blend is incredible.”

Pugh pinpointed the forward line where she features alongside Sophie Smith and Alex Morgan as a unit she’s looking forward to building leading into next summer’s World Cup.

“With Soph and Alex it’s fun to play with each other and I think it’s going to be a learning experience building into the World Cup of each other’s tendencies” she said. “I’m looking forward to that.”

The Chicago Red Stars standout also credited Ashley Sanchez and Naomi Girma for contributing in positive ways in their first major international tournament.

“I definitely do not want to be playing against those two in the league” she said.

While Pugh has had an up-and-down career with the USWNT and despite being left off of last summer’s Olympic roster she seems locked in to a starting spot under head coach Vlatko Andonovski.

“Not making the Olympic roster was actually the best thing that happened to my career” said Pugh. “I think it allowed me to one figure out some injuries but also give me some time away from the national team to work through that work through the adversity. I’m very thankful that happened.”

Pugh was also on set with Gatorade as part of the company’s “Thirst Trap” series. Her roots with Gatorade run all the way back to 2015 when she was named Gatorade National Girls Soccer Player of the Year following a prolific junior campaign at Mountain Vista High School (Colo.).

She reminded viewers to stay hydrated in the summer before revealing her personal favorite flavor: Cool Blue.

“I think Gatorade just does such a good job with providing for so many different levels of competition and everything” Pugh said. “I think that’s one of the big three is sleep hydration and nutrition so that’s always on my mind.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIyMDgwNDAwNTc0My9lbi9JbmR1c3RyeS1WZXRlcmFuLUFsYW4tU3RlaW4tSm9pbnMtSGVhbHRoRWRnZS1hcy1DaGllZi1Db21tZXJjaWFsLU9mZmljZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Industry Veteran Alan Stein Joins HealthEdge as Chief Commercial Officer,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIyMDgwNDAwNTc0My9lbi9JbmR1c3RyeS1WZXRlcmFuLUFsYW4tU3RlaW4tSm9pbnMtSGVhbHRoRWRnZS1hcy1DaGllZi1Db21tZXJjaWFsLU9mZmljZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D839184C0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIyMDgwNDAwNTc0My9lbi9JbmR1c3RyeS1WZXRlcmFuLUFsYW4tU3RlaW4tSm9pbnMtSGVhbHRoRWRnZS1hcy1DaGllZi1Db21tZXJjaWFsLU9mZmljZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMi5QFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaWdpdGFsam91cm5hbC5jb20vcHIvaW5jcmVkaWJsZS1kZW1hbmQtb2YtZGlnaXRhbC1lbmVyZ3ktY29uc3VsdGluZy1hbmQtbWFuYWdlbWVudC1tYXJrZXQtaW5zaWdodHMtMjAyMi1jdXJyZW50LWRldmVsb3BtZW50cy1pbmR1c3RyeS1yZXZlbnVlLWZpZ3VyZXMtYW5kLWNvbXBldGl0aXZlLWFuYWx5c2lzLXdpdGgtdG9wLWluZHVzdHJ5LXBsYXllcnMtZ2UtZW5lcmd5LWNvbnN10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Incredible Demand of Digital Energy Consulting and Management Market Insights: 2022 Current Developments ...,Rap is a known term to us.

Total net profit for H1 however was down 16% on the previous year at €1.13bn ($1.16bn).

Latin America strong net sales and growth​

Globally H1 and Q2 net sales in Latin America grew most significantly up 9% and 12.5% respectively with organic sales growth led by Colombia Brazil Mexico and Argentina. This was followed by a 3% H1 net sales rise and 6% Q2 net sales rise in North America. Europe saw the biggest drop in net sales for H1 and Q2 down 9.5% and 10% respectively.

A look at Colgate-Palmolive’s oral personal and home care business excluding its pet care division Hill’s saw Latin America also generating the lion’s share of net sales for H1 and Q2 pulling in €1.93bn ($1.97bn) and €981m ($1bn) respectively. This was followed by North America with H1 net sales at €1.85bn ($1.89bn) and Q2 net sales at €947m ($965m); then Asia Pacific with €1.37bn ($1.4bn) in H1 and €682m ($696m) in Q2; followed by Europe with €1.26bn ($1.29bn) in H1 and €626m ($639m) in Q2; and Africa/Eurasia with €513m ($523m) in H1 and €251m ($256m) in Q2.

Noel Wallace chairman president and CEO of Colgate-Palmolive said the results showed a “significant acceleration”​ versus the first quarter of the year despite continued cost increases across raw materials packaging and logistics.

“Our focus on premium innovation​ brand building and digital capabilities drove broad-based organic sales growth with growth in every division and all four of our categories including double-digit organic sales growth in oral care and pet nutrition. We are especially encouraged by the increase in our global toothpaste market share year to date led by share growth in the US where our focus on more premium innovation is driving share gains”​ Wallace said.

The company had “acted boldly”​ on pricing to offset headwinds he said and would continue to bring price changes in over the rest of the year.

“Our solid results this quarter despite significant headwinds from raw materials foreign exchange and the broader macro environment demonstrate that our strategies are working. We will continue to deliver impactful innovation that provides value to our customers and consumers as we work to offset these headwinds and deliver sustainable profitable growth over the long-term.”​

Speaking to analysts on the company’s earnings call Wallace added: “Foreign exchange has become a bigger headwind since our first quarter earnings release – the euro has moved to parity with the dollar and most other currencies have weakened as well – but we will continue to invest in our brands.”​

‘Pretty good vitality’ at consumer level​

Discussing the potential for softening consumer demand and trade down behaviour amidst inflationary pressures the CEO said there remained “pretty good vitality at the consumer level” ​across the globe ​with emerging markets growing mid-single digits albeit with some slowdown in the developed world notably sluggishness in some categories in Europe. So far however there had not been a lot of trade down he said though it remained “early days” ​and trade downs were to be expected moving forward.​

In any case Colgate-Palmolive would continue to innovate across its portfolio at the high and low end of the market across all price points he said to ensure the company could capture any trade downs should they happen.

“It’s our responsibility to bring innovation across price points; our responsibility to work with the trade to drive volume back in the categories. We have big traffic builders. Our brands are strong around the world and we know our retailers rely on us to bring traffic into their stores and drive volume and basket. So we will continue to focus on finding innovation to ensure that the volume aspect of the category is protected”​ Wallace said.

“…We will watch the consumer really closely (…) We obviously have a lot of teams on the ground looking at exactly where the elasticities are but so far elasticities are in line with what we expected or slightly better”​ he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmp1c3QtZm9vZC5jb20vbmV3cy9jb2xnYXRlLXBhbG1vbGl2ZXMtaGlsbHMtcGV0LW51dHJpdGlvbi1leWVzLXJlZC1jb2xsYXItcGV0LWZvb2RzLXBsYW50cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Colgate-Palmolive's Hill's Pet Nutrition eyes Red Collar Pet Foods plants,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.just-food.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/colgate-palmolives-hills-pet-nutrition-eyes-red-collar-pet-foods-plants/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D83209840>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmp1c3QtZm9vZC5jb20vbmV3cy9jb2xnYXRlLXBhbG1vbGl2ZXMtaGlsbHMtcGV0LW51dHJpdGlvbi1leWVzLXJlZC1jb2xsYXItcGV0LWZvb2RzLXBsYW50cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vY29zbWV0aWNzYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tLzUtd2F5cy1za2luLWNhcmUtaXMtdHJhbnNmb3JtaW5nLW9yYWwtY2FyZS0yMDI3MTLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 ways skin care is transforming oral care,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='cosmeticsbusiness.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /5-ways-skin-care-is-transforming-oral-care-202712 (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D83208070>, 'Connection to cosmeticsbusiness.com timed out.

Comcast has told employees it’s time to come back to work — in person.

Starting Sept. 12 all U.S.-based Comcast cable and corporate workers should be working in the office three days a week according to a corporate memo. That includes the 8000 employees who will work in the two downtown Philadelphia towers.

Comcast is designating “common” days — Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday — for in-office work while on Mondays and Fridays employees can work remotely.

“In-person interaction ... is core to our company and culture” said the memo distributed nationally Tuesday. “We need more certainty and direction to coordinate our in-office time.” The company had previously encouraged employees to work three days a week in the office but had not specified the days.

Comcast’s new return-to-work policy could bring thousands back downtown and help spur a slow economic revitalization of JFK Boulevard where the company has its headquarters and technology center.

“The more business leaders who recognize the positive economic impact that their in-office presence has on diverse small businesses downtown and all those workers who don’t have the option of working remotely the faster we can achieve the full restoration of jobs of all kinds across the city” said Paul Levy director of the Center City District a business leadership organization.

Comcast isn’t requiring proof of vaccination to return to the offices in Center City or nationwide according to the memo. A company spokesperson said the company would adhere to local and state regulations on masking and vaccinations.

“My team had some concerns” said one Comcast employee who asked to remain anonymous because of not being authorized to speak to the media. “It’s hard to put the genie back in the bottle because so many people haven’t been back in the office. Some of my employees are in Maryland or way out in New Jersey. So they’re effectively fully remote for good.”

The Sept. 12 date accommodates the start of school for employees with children.

A year ago Comcast reopened its offices in downtown Philly but COVID’s delta variant delayed a return and contributed to a slow choppy pandemic recovery. Comcast is the eighth largest employer in Philadelphia County according to the state’s Center for Workforce Information & Analysis.

The county’s other top seven largest employers are mostly “eds-and-meds” or educational and medical employers such as the University of Pennsylvania city and federal workers the School District of Philadelphia Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Temple University and Thomas Jefferson University Hospital.

A spokeswoman said Comcast has encouraged employees to work in person for months. She declined to call the new three common days in-office policy “mandatory” saying Comcast was asking employees to do this.

Companies around the country calling staffers back to the workplace in many cases are offering similar hybrid schedules allowing people to come in only a few days a week. Google launched hybrid work in April to much employee pushback.

Community Legal Services of Philadelphia has 180 people on staff including attorneys and other employees and is trying to balance the need to have open walk-in hours while protecting its diverse workforce said Kee Tobar chief equity and inclusion officer.

“What does it mean to come back to the office for someone who is immunocompromised?” Tobar said. “They get on the train at peak hours and we’re still amid a pandemic.”

Comcast’s return to its headquarters in Center City “is a harbinger for other businesses and employers returning. Other businesses have taken cover from Comcast’s decision” not to return until now said Ben Haney owner of the Mulberry bar and restaurant on the corner of 18th and Arch Streets.

“It’s Comcast who people look to and when their two giant towers are empty they say ‘why should we come back?’” he added.

Haney is hoping the Mulberry can expand its hours if foot traffic improves with Comcast’s return to the office. “This gives us a way to plan; it’s reasonable and consistent” he said. “We should be entertaining how to do lunch sometime in October. Right now we just do dinner.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaG5pY2FsLmx5L2NvbXBhbnktY3VsdHVyZS9jb21jYXN0LWNlbnRlci1jaXR5LXBoaWxseS1vZmZpY2UtcmV0dXJuLXNlcHRlbWJlci0yMDIyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Comcast is expecting employees back in the office 3 days a week starting in September,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaG5pY2FsLmx5L2NvbXBhbnktY3VsdHVyZS9jb21jYXN0LWNlbnRlci1jaXR5LXBoaWxseS1vZmZpY2UtcmV0dXJuLXNlcHRlbWJlci0yMDIyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D81E65210>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaG5pY2FsLmx5L2NvbXBhbnktY3VsdHVyZS9jb21jYXN0LWNlbnRlci1jaXR5LXBoaWxseS1vZmZpY2UtcmV0dXJuLXNlcHRlbWJlci0yMDIyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vY29ycG9yYXRlLmNvbWNhc3QuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvY29tY2FzdC1yaXNlLWJsYWNrLW93bmVkLWJ1c2luZXNzZXMtYmxhY2stZW50cmVwcmVuZXVycy1ibGFjay1idXNpbmVzcy1tb250aNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Comcast RISE Celebrates Black-Owned Businesses and Black Entrepreneurs During Black Business Month,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vY29ycG9yYXRlLmNvbWNhc3QuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvY29tY2FzdC1yaXNlLWJsYWNrLW93bmVkLWJ1c2luZXNzZXMtYmxhY2stZW50cmVwcmVuZXVycy1ibGFjay1idXNpbmVzcy1tb250aNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D81E67C10>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vY29ycG9yYXRlLmNvbWNhc3QuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvY29tY2FzdC1yaXNlLWJsYWNrLW93bmVkLWJ1c2luZXNzZXMtYmxhY2stZW50cmVwcmVuZXVycy1ibGFjay1idXNpbmVzcy1tb250aNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlZWt3aXJlLmNvbS9zcG9uc29yLXBvc3QvdGVlaW5nLXVwLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktdG8ta2VlcC10aGUtYm9laW5nLWNsYXNzaWMtY29ubmVjdGVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Teeing Up Technology to Keep the Boeing Classic Connected,"On August 8 the PGA Tour Champions event returns to Snoqualmie Washington.

Enhanced connectivity at Snoqualmie Ridge is the latest example of the company’s network investment in the state. During the past three years Comcast has invested $1B in technology and infrastructure in Washington including expansion and upgrades to our network.

Comcast technicians will be installing more than 100 cable boxes and modems for vendors and attendees so they can have access to WiFi to watch the action on the course when inside. Technicians also utilize more than 4000 feet of heavy-duty cable which they place all around the course and facility.

Because of this attendees will have unprecedented performance in the high-traffic centers. Plus we also operate public Xfinity Wi-Fi hotspots that are available to Comcast customers in Snoqualmie to provide extra coverage to fans.

“Comcast has been a longtime supplier and partner of the Boeing Classic. We appreciate the amount of time and effort they put into their work to ensure the tournament is supported and operates seamlessly” said Ryan Ingalls Tournament Director

“We are proud of our continued investments in Washington especially as we welcome athletes and fans to Snoqualmie” said Rodrigo Lopez Region Senior Vice President Comcast Washington. “Our network installation will provide high-speed and reliable connectivity for our customers during the tournament.”

About the Comcast Network

After hitting historic peaks in 2020 traffic on the Comcast network grew again in 2021 according to the Comcast 2021 Network Report. Backed by billions in strategic investment and groundbreaking advances in network technology the Comcast network continued to thrive and delivered above-advertised speeds to customers throughout this unprecedented era.

“It’s events like The Boeing Classic that reinforce how the internet keeps fans event staff and other attendees connected to the moments that matter” added Lopez. “Over the past two years our network has been a powerful and reliable pillar for our customers as they’ve navigated dramatic changes in how we live learn play and work. The outstanding performance of the network throughout this time is a testament to our commitment to strategic investment unceasing innovation and the incredible talent and dedication of our technology team in Washington state.”

Continuous network innovation has been essential not just to managing the pandemic traffic surge but also in future-proofing the network as demand continues to grow for unique events like the Boeing Classic.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3R1Y3Nvbi5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9zdWJzY3JpYmVyL3dpdGgtY29udGludWVkLXNoaWZ0LXRvLXJlbW90ZS13b3JrLW1hbnktdHVjc29uLW9mZmljZXMtc2l0LWVtcHR5L2FydGljbGVfNGFlMzUzMWMtMGM1OC0xMWVkLTgyYWMtZTdiZDIzOGQ1N2U2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,With continued shift to remote work many Tucson offices sit empty,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3R1Y3Nvbi5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9zdWJzY3JpYmVyL3dpdGgtY29udGludWVkLXNoaWZ0LXRvLXJlbW90ZS13b3JrLW1hbnktdHVjc29uLW9mZmljZXMtc2l0LWVtcHR5L2FydGljbGVfNGFlMzUzMWMtMGM1OC0xMWVkLTgyYWMtZTdiZDIzOGQ1N2U2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D81E67A60>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3R1Y3Nvbi5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9zdWJzY3JpYmVyL3dpdGgtY29udGludWVkLXNoaWZ0LXRvLXJlbW90ZS13b3JrLW1hbnktdHVjc29uLW9mZmljZXMtc2l0LWVtcHR5L2FydGljbGVfNGFlMzUzMWMtMGM1OC0xMWVkLTgyYWMtZTdiZDIzOGQ1N2U2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

With the current tenant moving out in June 2023 it allows Wells Fargo to seamlessly relocate from 5355 Town Center Road once its lease at that location expires according to the landlord Tricera Capital.

“We remain bullish on Palm Beach County’s core markets especially Boca Raton and Downtown West Palm Beach” Tricera CEO Ben Mandell said in a statement. “[South Florida has] benefited greatly from the domestic and corporate migration of the last few years.”

The lease term was for seven years with an asking rent of $39 per square foot.

CBRE (CBRE)’s John Criddle Joe Freitas and Chris Smith represented Tricera in the deal while Shane O’Neil of O’Neil Commercial Advisors negotiated on behalf of Wells Fargo. CBRE and O’Neill did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The seven-story building was constructed in 2008. Tricera Capital acquired it in November 2021 and commenced a renovation of its lobbies common corridors restrooms and building systems with help from Kravit Architectural Associates.

With 90 percent of 1675 North Military Trail’s 70000 square feet leased Tricera is leveraging other assets in South Florida as a growing number of firms relocate from other cities.

Tricera also owns One Clearlake an office development in Downtown West Palm Beach and is putting the finishing touches on The Press a mixed-use redevelopment of the 8-acre former Palm Beach Post campus to offer mostly office space. Coworking startup Knotel will occupy 18000 square feet in the development Commercial Observer reported earlier this week.

It is a high-class celebration of the most high performing and elite automobiles. For years it has been held at the beautiful St. John's Hotel and Golf Course in Plymouth.

“What we felt was missing from it was the city of Detroit” said McKeel Hagerty the CEO of Hagerty.

Hagerty says next month we will have a weekend-long tribute to American car culture in Detroit.

It will include a Cars and Community show Saturday Sept. 17 at Comerica Park. That evening there will be a “Motor City Party” at the College for Creative Studies Taubman Center.

During the party guests will pay tribute to Ed Welburn a designer Automotive Hall of Fame inductee and former General Motors vice president of Global Design.

They will also hear from Ralph Gilles chief design officer at Stellantis Hau Thai-Tang executive vice president at Ford Motor Company and Doug L. Parks executive vice president at General Motors to discuss the future of the automobile industry.

Then on Sunday the Concours d’Elegance will take place at the Detroit Institute of Arts featuring historically significant vehicles.

“The idea is to really elevate cars to their highest forms. The artwork the music that was part of that time. So it is kind of like a rolling museum display but it will take place right here at the DIA in this leafy green environment” Hagerty sid.

Dubbed “fuel for growth” the initiative will encompass production logistics margin management and new capabilities.

“By implementing a fuel for growth program we will accelerate productivity over the next three years” said Alexandre O. Eboli chief supply chain officer during the company’s July 27 investor day presentation. “From a historical average of 2% to 3% we expect to accelerate productivity to achieve 4% of cost of goods sold by fiscal year ‘25.”

Conagra’s supply chain encompasses 42 plants and 25 distribution centers with 15000 employees that produce more than 5000 products and account for 80% of the company’s volume. External partners make up the rest of the volume.

Five components will support the program including optimization productivity agility people and a focus on sustainability. Perhaps the most significant impact will be felt in logistics said Mr. Eboli.

“Today we have 25 distribution centers supporting our business” he said. “We will reduce our distribution centers by 50% while at the same time leverage best-in-class logistics operators to provide automation that will allow facilities to run 24/7 service our customers and optimize our costs.”

Mr. Eboli used a distribution center in Atlanta as an example noting that the site now combines a Conagra and former Pinnacle operation in the Southeast.

“This is a 24/7 fully automated distribution center operating with 50% fewer people than a traditional warehouse” he said. “Only in this location we are expecting to deliver $3 million in savings in warehousing cost per year.

“Over the next three years the consolidation of the network across both frozen and ambient networks across the country is expected to deliver $200 million total savings in logistics with optimization not only of warehousing costs but also transportation costs by optimizing the number of miles we travel.”

To improve productivity the company is enhancing its data and analytics capabilities. With the new tools cross-functional teams will be able to better identify opportunities to reduce cost in materials manufacturing and logistics.

At a baking plant in Indianapolis the cross-functional team approach shows the benefits Mr. Eboli said.

“This team is composed of resources across R&D manufacturing logistics finance and procurement” he said. “With every product design assessment we begin by benchmarking our products against our competition trading for alternatives for ingredients and packaging while keeping the key attributes that our consumers love about our products. In this example not only are we able to improve our material costs; we are also able to reduce repetitive manual labor ultimately reducing our COGS by 250 bps.”

Digitization of systems has helped Conagra Brands tap into the benefits of computer analysis.

“We have built a data lake to take advantage of the vast amount of information being collected across these specialized applications” Mr. Eboli said. “At the top layer we have the intelligence and orchestration layers where we apply machine learning and artificial intelligence to drive insights and agility.

“The tools that we are now using provide us with greater visibility and allow us to make data-driven decisions on long-term capacity plans. … We expect these tools and capabilities to deliver an increase in revenue through improved service decreased operating costs in our plants and distribution centers while reducing overall working capital.”

Using the tools has allowed Conagra’s Slim Jim meat snack business to identify and unlock 40% capacity over the past four years according to the company.

“… and we will unlock another 20% over the next 12 months” Mr. Eboli said. “With Slim Jim being the largest meat stick brand our long-range demand forecast continues to be strong. We leverage our planning tool to define forward-looking capacity requirements across our network. And right now we are evaluating future investments to support growth beyond 2025.”

The company also is in the process of digitally connecting its manufacturing operations. Called the “connected shop floor” the program will feature four pillars.

“The first pillar of the program is connected line” Mr. Eboli said. “We will be connecting all equipment on production lines to the web providing a constant flow of data to our teams. The second pillar is connected worker providing an electronic way for the team to collect data on a mobile device.

“The third pillar is yield management which allows the teams to attract material efficiency supplier quality and adherence to the standards required to produce consistent and repeatable products minimizing waste. And lastly we are investing in dashboards and alerts so that our frontline teams and site leadership can take timely actions on high-priority events.”

The initiative is expected to deliver $300 million in manufacturing savings over the next three years according to Conagra Brands.

“Our disciplined approach will accelerate capital spending over the next three years to between 4% and 5% of net sales compared to a baseline of 3.5% to 4%” Mr. Eboli said. “We then expect this to moderate back to our prior capital allocation plans pre fiscal year '23. These investments will be deployed two-thirds to growth and productivity and one-third to foundational elements like quality safety and infrastructure.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWxpbWFya2V0bmV3cy5jb20vcXVpY2stYml0ZS9kZWwtbW9udGUtZm9vZHMtYWNxdWlyZXMta2l0Y2hlbi1iYXNpY3MtZ3JlZy1sb25nc3RyZWV0LWFuZC1iaWJpZS13dS1jb21tZW50L2plbm5hLXBsYXN0ZXJlci9mcmktMDgwNTIwMjItMDg1Mi8xNDAzMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Del Monte Foods Acquires Kitchen Basics; Greg Longstreet and Bibie Wu Comment,"WALNUT CREEK CA

The well about 160 km offshore about 10 km north of Heidrun will be drilled using the Deepsea Stavanger semisubmersible drilling rig with a planned spud date in September and a duration of up to 43 days according to Norway's Environment Agency.

According to Equinor's Q2 2022 report the prospect could contain 43 mm boe pre-drill unrisked.

Last month Equinor awarded further work for Odfjell Drilling's Deepsea Stavanger semi-submersible drilling rig. The deal is awarded under the continued optionality mechanism provided for in the contract entered into by the two companies in May 2021.

Following the addition the Deepsea Stavanger had eight remaining wells to be drilled which are expected to occupy the rig into Q3 2023.

Equinor has the opportunity to exercise further wells under the continued optionality mechanism.

Equinor's partners in Othello North are ConocoPhillips (27%) Petoro (27%) and Vår Energi (10%)."

Launched in 2007 the commercial renewables group now accounts for about 5% of Charlotte-based Duke’s earnings and is among the country’s top 10 such ventures. A sale of the portfolio which comprises more than 5100MW of gross capacity across the country would be one of the largest transactions to date of a group of renewable energy projects and would help Duke lighten its debt load. Wind comprises 66% of that net generating capacity with solar accounting for 33% and battery projects in Texas making up the small remainder.

“Our strategic review will be thorough yet timely” Chair President and CEO Lynn Good said on a conference call with analysts and investors adding that the process should conclude by year’s end. “Our regulated businesses are strongly positioned to grow within our earnings guidance range of 5% to 7% providing consistent earnings and cash flow and supporting our attractive dividend.”

Duke’s decision to bring its commercial renewables which have a book value of about $4 billion to the market adds to similar moves by a number of its peers. Those include Eversource Energy and Consolidated Edison which bills itself as the second-largest owner of solar electric projects in North America. Good said she expects strong interest from potential buyers in part because Duke has more than 1GW of projects in the works “that could be quite valuable in 2024 2025.”

“I believe there will be a robust market for these assets given that it's not only operating assets but also a development pipeline a platform a team of very capable developers and operators that I think have the potential to add a great deal of value” Good said on the conference call.

In the first six months of this year the commercial renewables business produced a $63 million operating loss on revenues of $242 million. Adjusted for special items and noncontrolling interest the group had earnings of $57 million down from $74 million in the first six months of 2021.

Good and her team announced the renewables review along with Duke’s second-quarter results which were headlined by net income of $880 million (versus $698 million in the prior-year period) on total operating revenues of nearly $6.7 billion. Operating income rose 21% to more than $1.4 billion helped by total retail sales rising 1.5% on a weather-normalized basis.

Both industrial and commercial customers increased their electric volumes by 1.7% during the quarter and the total number of residential electric customers was up 1.8% year over year. Those numbers have led Good and CFO Steve Young to lift their full-year load growth forecast to a range of 1.5% to 2% from their previous 1.5% even though they expect growth to slow a little in the second half of the year.

Shares of Duke (Ticker: DUK) were down about 1% in afternoon trading Aug. 5.

(NYSE: STZ and STZ.B) a leading beverage alcohol company announced that it has acquired a minority stake in wine brand Archer Roose – an accessible luxury wine brand focused on offering consciously-crafted worldly wines to a new generation of legal drinking age (LDA) wine drinkers. This investment was made through Constellation’s venture capital group as a part of Constellation’s Focus on Female Founders initiative which aims to directly increase female representation and access to funding in the industry by investing $100 million in female-led or female-founded companies by 2028.

Marian Leitner-Waldman and her husband David founded Archer Roose in 2015 on a mission to democratize wine by introducing consumers to luxury wine in an approachable format. To offer wines from the most renowned regions around the world – from Provence to Casablanca Valley – they created the “Traveling Vineyard” by partnering with small adventurous winemakers who preserve terroir and approach viticulture with craftsmanship and deep respect for the environment. Driven by the idea of connecting to wine consumers through humor actress and producer Elizabeth Banks joined the team as an investor and chief creative officer.

“Marian Elizabeth and the team have created something truly unique in Archer Roose making luxury wine distinctively fun and accessible for contemporary consumers who are curious about exploring the category” said Mallika Monteiro executive vice president and chief growth strategy and digital officer at Constellation Brands. “Their focus on planet-friendly single serving formats resonates not just with the environmentally conscious values of this new generation of LDA drinkers but also with consumer moderation trends that we are beginning to see take hold. We believe Archer Roose is well-positioned to grow the category by introducing premium wine to this segment through their welcoming thoughtful and honest brand.”

“We founded Archer Roose for a simple reason we wanted to have a better glass of wine” said Marian Leitner-Waldman co-founder of Archer Roose. “Our consumers can discover wine regions and varietals while knowing what to expect from our products: dry fruit-forward wines that are sustainably made and exceptionally delicious.”

Archer Roose strives to bring consumers high-quality wines in accessible formats that fit their modern lifestyle helping them celebrate the joy in every day with a single serving of wine that can be enjoyed without opening a full bottle. Their luxury canned wines are offered in a number of crisp refreshing varietals including Bubbly Bubbly Rosé Rosé Pinot Grigio Sauvignon Blanc and Malbec.

Timeless adventurer Archer Roose is a character that was created to take the contemporary wine drinker on a journey of wine connecting consumers to a global portfolio through the lens of her travels. Each Archer Roose wine is like a postcard transparently sharing the people place practices and profile of all of their wines. Inspired by embracing fun and humor without sacrificing quality Archer Roose pairs this memorable icon with comedic force Elizabeth Banks to appeal to a new generation of LDA wine drinkers.

“I joined Archer Roose because I wanted to bring fun to wine” said Elizabeth Banks. “Wine can take itself so seriously but at Archer Roose we make seriously good wine accessible through storytelling that resonates with our consumers’ lives.”

Archer Roose comprises an award-winning portfolio of wines that have been highlighted in Wine Spectator. The brand is currently distributed in 46 states can be found in major retailers like Kroger Eataly and Mariano’s and will be on shelves in Target this fall. You can also enjoy Archer Roose at new heights through their partnership with JetBlue.

Constellation’s Focus on Female Founders initiative is designed to make meaningful investments in female-founded and female-led businesses doing disruptive and innovative work across the beverage alcohol industry. Since its launch in 2018 the Focus on Female Founders initiative has shifted our Ventures portfolio mix from approximately 20% female-founded/owned to nearly 50% female-founded/owned.

Female-founded companies accounted for only 2% of venture capital investments in 2021 which was the second consecutive year that the number of female-founded companies receiving funding decreased1. Analyses show female-founded startups that get funded are more likely to succeed and deliver higher value than male-founded companies2. Female-founded companies also hire more women and help close the pay gap3.

This is a guest contribution from Harvi Sadhra with Hashtag Investing

With rising inflation levels and volatility in the market people have started to look at defensive stocks. One of the best defensive options is stocks that provide passive income aka dividend stocks. Companies that pay dividend during tough times are perceived as more stable than other growth stocks.

Marijuana stocks as a whole are still in their growth stage and are not a regular hunting ground for dividend stocks. However there are a handful of marijuana companies in the US and Canada that do pay reasonable dividends.

Here we have mentioned 5 marijuana stocks that have a high dividend yield:

Dividend-Paying Marijuana Stock #1: Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR)

Innovative Industrial Properties is not really a marijuana producer. This REIT (real estate investment trust) acquires properties and leases them back to cannabis companies and earns rental income in this process. Some of its top tenants include popular marijuana players such as Trulieve Cannabis Cresco Labs Curaleaf Holdings and Green Thumb Industries. Innovative is also less risky than most other pot stocks because it is generally not much affected by the challenges faced by the marijuana industry in general.

Innovative has huge growth opportunities and has been expanding itself since 2020 and currently has about 109 properties encompassing 8.1 million rentable square feet across 19 states. The REIT is still aggressively looking for more opportunities to expand itself.

Besides Innovative has some solid financials and has also hiked its dividend payouts by 33% year-over-year to $1.70 per share in the first quarter of this year. This has been the 13th time the REIT has increased its dividend payouts since its IPO. Further the rate of growth of its adjusted funds from operations indicates the REIT has sufficient earnings available to pay out dividends. Moreover considering the S&P 500’s average yield of 2% the yield of 5.3% provided by the REIT is much more attractive.

Dividend-Paying Marijuana Stock #2: Scotts Miracle Grow (SMG)

Scotts Miracle Gro is an Ohio based organization that manufactures and sells consumer lawn garden and pest control products including hydroponics equipment and cultivation lights for the indoor growing of customers. The company has its special focus on the cannabis industry through its subsidiary Hawthorne. This stock provides a great option for investors who intend to earn passive income.

These days amidst their busy schedule not many people are flocking to start gardening. Therefore Scotts Miracle’s earnings from continuing operations for the recent second quarter had decreased to $276.5 million or $4.94 per share and the net revenue has also fallen by 8.2% year over year to $1678.4 million. However on comparing its financials for the past three years it can be observed that there has been an incredible increase in its revenues and net income.

Scotts Miracle provides an annualized dividend yield of 2.73% and the size of its dividend payouts too has increased by around 20% over the past three years. Its last dividend hike was announced on April 2022. Therefore it is indeed one of the best dividend stocks one can find in the marijuana industry at this moment.

Dividend-Paying Marijuana Stock #3: Altria Group (MO)

Altria Group is one of the top players in the tobacco sector and has made its play into the Canadian marijuana industry by acquiring a substantial stake in the top Canadian marijuana player Cronos Group. It is trying to increase its sphere of influence by successfully lobbying for the legalization of marijuana.

Given Altria’s current position and exposure to the marijuana industry the company stands to benefit greatly from the current developments that have been taking place in this industry these days. Besides the company can be rightly called the dividend king as it has been increasing its dividend payouts over the past 50 years. Moreover considering the stable balance sheet the dividend yield that currently stands at 6.65% and the fact that the company is likely to continue paying such handsome dividends in the coming times as well Altria is definitely one of the best dividend stocks in the marijuana industry that the investors can hold onto.

Dividend-Paying Marijuana Stock #4: Compass Diversified Holdings (CODI)

Compass Diversified Holdings is a Connecticut-based company that boasts substantial long-term potential and has an impressive track record of growth. The company partners with the management teams to acquire businesses some of which belong to the cannabis industry. It also recently sold its stake in Manitoba Harvest a hemp food company to Tilray one of the biggest cannabis companies and thereby earning a large number of Tilray shares in the process.

Through all these strings of acquisitions Compass has gained a strong hold in the emerging cannabis sector. Further the company already has an impressive dividend yield of 4.34%. Its financial position also indicates it will be able to support its dividend payments well in the coming days as well. Therefore if anyone wants a dividend-paying stock having diversified exposure including a strong hold on the marijuana industry they can go for Compass.

Dividend-Paying Marijuana Stock #5: Constellation Brands (STZ)

Constellation Brands is one of the world’s largest alcoholic beverage companies that has invested $4 billion in the Canadian marijuana player Canopy Growth (CGC) and in the process has got a substantial hold over the marijuana industry. The company also intends to roll out marijuana-infused beverages due to its vast experience in the beverage industry.

The investors of this company are provided with a dividend yield of about 1.30% which is not a lot but is much better compared to other pot stocks that make no dividend payouts at all. Besides because of its huge investment in Canopy Growth the company gets to taste the fruits of all the developments taking place in the marijuana industry.

To conclude depending on one’s personal preference and risk appetite there are various ways to gain exposure to the cannabis industry. While some stocks provide direct exposure some don’t. The above-mentioned stocks apart from paying off decent dividends also provide a reasonable exposure to the cannabis industry. But before investing in any of these stocks investors should properly research the risks associated with each of them.

Canada’s Canopy Growth Corp. WEED-T reported a $2.1-billion loss in the first quarter of its 2023 fiscal year another major blow for the former cannabis star as it tries to restructure its business in order to win back investors.

The lion’s share of the loss stems from a $1.7-billion goodwill writedown on Canopy’s cannabis operations a non-cash charge management attributed to a decrease in the company’s stock market value in the first quarter which ended June 30.

Goodwill often accumulates when paying premiums for acquisition targets and Canopy has now written off all the goodwill it has compiled in its cannabis division. The company now also runs a consumer products division that includes BioSteel energy drinks which was one of the few bright spots this quarter.

The cannabis sector has been struggling for quite some time but until recently Canopy’s shares kept a premium valuation relative to its peers. That has changed in the past few months as investors have dumped the company’s stock at a rapid pace.

In May Canopy once Canada’s top LP (or licensed producer) of cannabis by market share disclosed it would not make money by the second half of fiscal 2022 – at least after excluding certain costs – as it had previously promised. It also pushed the deadline for profitability out by two years to fiscal 2024.

A month later Canopy announced it would swap some bonds for shares in order to reduce its troubling debt burden. It agreed to hand out new stock which diluted existing shareholders and as part of the swap to repay $345-million in cash next summer.

Investors revolted. In June alone Canopy’s share price on the Toronto Stock Exchange tumbled 42 per cent. Over the past year its shares are down more than double that. On Friday Canopy’s shares declined 7 per cent by midday.

The new goodwill writedown reported Friday morning dominated Canopy’s first quarter loss but the company’s core business also struggled with total revenue falling 19 per cent to $110-million from the year prior.

Canopy’s Canadian recreational cannabis operations – once its bread and butter – was a leading factor with revenue from the unit falling 35 per cent to $39-million from the same quarter last year. Canopy attributed much of the drop to competitive pricing for non-premium cannabis because the Canadian market is wildly oversupplied with this product.

“The Canadian market has developed really differently than we expected” chief financial officer Judy Hong said on a conference call with analysts and investors Friday.

Canopy’s adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization) which strips out certain costs and is normally a more favourable metric for reporting companies dropped 18 per cent from the year prior to a loss of $75-million.

The rough quarter is troubling for Constellation Brands Inc. STZ-N the U.S. alcohol giant that invested a total of $5.2-billion in Canopy back when it seemed like recreational weed could be the next big thing. Constellation invested in two tranches and the second was a $5-billion cheque that valued Canopy’s shares at $48.60 each. By midday Friday Canopy’s stock was trading around $3.40 on the TSX.

Canopy now run by Constellation’s chosen leaders is trying to turn a corner and management laid out a revitalization plan in May. In Canada its focus is on premium cannabis a response to the country’s oversupply of cut-rate mediocre weed. Canopy also plans to cut more expenses – particularly sales marketing and general costs which it hopes to reduce by 25 per cent. Roughly half of its cost savings are expected to come from job reductions.

However the current management team has banked heavily on the United States legalizing recreational cannabis at the federal level. After Joe Biden won the presidency in 2020 and the Democrats took 50 seats in the U.S. Senate there was enormous hope this would happen. But with Republicans seemingly poised to retake the Senate in midterm elections this fall many analysts believe those dreams have all but disappeared.

On Friday chief executive officer David Klein reiterated his commitment to U.S. expansion. Canopy currently has a number of brands in the U.S. market but their growth is limited by rules that don’t allow businesses to cross state lines. “We continue to see the U.S. as the largest and most important market in the world” he said.

However he acknowledged the challenges. “We placed a big bet on the U.S. and it’s taking longer to evolve than we would have liked” Mr. Klein said.

Updated on May 24th 2022 by Jonathan Weber for SureDividend

The marijuana industry continues to experience a lot of growth. Multiple countries around the world have already moved to legalized recreational marijuana. In the U.S. 18 states plus DC have legalized recreational marijuana already with many more having legalized medicinal use – 39 in total. It is likely that more states will follow suit in the coming years and eventually there might be federal legalization of marijuana in the US.

While this naturally leads to a potentially significant investment opportunity investors would do well to remember some of the industry bubbles of the past. For example the tech bubble of the late 1990’s is a constant reminder that rapid industry growth alone does not guarantee investing success. Choosing the highest-quality companies (or least risky stocks) in a growing industry can make a world of difference for returns.

Industry Overview

The cannabis plant can be divided into 2 broad categories based on tetrahydrocannabinol [THC] content:

High THC – what we often refer to as marijuana

Nearly no THC – what we often refer to as hemp

Marijuana has recreational and pharmaceutical uses while hemp has primarily industrial uses.

Interestingly THC is one of more than 480 known substances in the plant with more than 60 of those being cannabinoids.

Marijuana can be used either by smoking by vaporizing as content in food or beverages or as an extract.

Marijuana Use & Legality Around The Globe

Over the last couple of years marijuana laws around the globe have been relaxed in many cases an increasing number of countries (and US states) have legalized the medical and in some cases the recreational use of marijuana. The drug has so far not been legalized on the federal level in the US though. The image below shows legalization by country/state blue countries and states allow recreational cannabis use while green countries and states allow the medical use of cannabis.

Source

Marijuana has been partially or fully legalized in around 50 countries as of May 2022. In most cases medical marijuana has been legalized while the recreational use of marijuana has not (yet) been legalized.

In Canada marijuana was fully legalized on the federal level in 2018. Several other countries such as Germany and Mexico have decriminalized the use and possession of small amounts of marijuana.

In the majority of US states marijuana has been at least partially legalized and the number of those states has grown steadily in recent years.

Source

18 states as well as the District of Columbia allow the recreational use of marijuana by adults with age restrictions ranging from 18 to 21.

In those countries and US states where marijuana has not been legalized marijuana is still used regularly. It is the most commonly used illegal drug in both the world as well as in the United States where a 2021 study found that 49% of Americans had used the drug at least once. Globally around 190 million people use marijuana for recreational purposes every year according to UN estimates.

Medical Use Of Marijuana

Medical marijuana also called medical cannabis refers to marijuana that has been prescribed by doctors to their patients as a form of treatment for a variety of symptoms. Evidence suggests that the consumption of marijuana (or marijuana-based products) can have positive impacts on patients with certain conditions that are not explained by the placebo effect.

The use cases for medical marijuana include:

The treatment of nausea and vomiting for patients undergoing chemotherapy

Increasing appetite for patients with an HIV/AIDS infection

The treatment of chronic pain (e.g. caused by peripheral neuropathy) and muscle spasms

The treatment of neurological issues such as multiple sclerosis (MS) epilepsy and movement problems.

Sleep improvement

the reduction of tics for patients with Tourette syndrome

the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder

In those countries where medical marijuana has been legalized it oftentimes has only been allowed for a couple of years. The medical marijuana market thus is still in a relatively early phase of growth.

Potential growth catalysts for the industry include:

Rising usage in countries that have legalized the use of cannabis More countries legalizing the use of cannabis

A study from 2022 suggest that the US legal marijuana market (medical and recreational) will grow to as much as $80 billion by 2030. The report that was published by Grand View Research sees an annual market growth rate in excess of 25% in that time frame.

For doctors to increasingly prescribe medical marijuana instead of opioid narcotics (which can cause addiction and serious side effects and are thus not necessarily harmless) is seen as another long-term growth driver for the use of medical marijuana as a form of pain relief.

The most important geographic markets will be those where healthcare budgets are meaningful and where marijuana has been (partially) legalized. This includes the United States (states where the use of medical marijuana has been legalized) Canada Israel Australia parts of Europe (Germany Italy France The Netherlands) and parts of South America (Chile Argentina).

Recreational Use Of Marijuana

Marijuana the world’s most commonly used illegal drug has a potentially very wide (and growing) legal recreational market.

In the US the recreational cannabis market is forecasted to grow to $25 billion by 2025 although growth is forecasted to slow down meaningfully over time – to just 5%-10% a year by the middle of the current decade.

According to this 2022 report the recreational cannabis market in Canada is generating sales of $11 billion a year while also sustaining more than 90000 jobs across manufacturing retail and so on. More Canadians have started using the drug in recent years since it has been legalized while some users who consumed illicit marijuana have shifted towards consuming regulated legal cannabis instead.

Even though marijuana has not been legalized in the United States on a federal level the US still has become the most important market for recreational marijuana over the years. In the 18 states where marijuana has been legalized a number that will likely continue to grow over the coming years recreational marijuana sales outpaced medical marijuana sales.

Forbes has forecasted that medical marijuana will make up just 35% of global legal marijuana sales in 2022 down from almost 100% one decade earlier. We do believe that it is likely that recreational marijuana could continue to gain market share versus medical marijuana especially if recreational marijuana gets legalized in additional countries and states.

The global peer market is projected to be worth $685 billion by 2025. The global tobacco market for reference is worth about $700 billion annually with a low-single-digit growth rate. Compared to those two markets the recreational marijuana market still is rather small which could indicate a lot of future upside. On the other hand investors should consider that beer and tobacco are legal in more markets around the world compared to marijuana which is still restricted in many parts of the world.

Analysts have been projecting significant market growth for the global marijuana markets for years. In recent years the market has indeed grown meaningfully. But if the current growth projections for 2025-2030 do not materialize e.g. due to legalization changes or shifts in consumer behavior or because these projections were wrong in the first place these market size estimates could turn out to be way too optimistic thus investors should take these projections with a grain of salt.

Investors should also keep the following statement by Benjamin Graham in mind:

“Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not translate into obvious profits for investors.”

Market growth rates do not necessarily go hand in hand with high profits for the corporations that are active in this respective market and they especially do not go hand in hand with meaningful shareholder payouts.

Growth stocks that are priced for perfection can disappoint investors and produce underwhelming total returns even if the original thesis about strong underlying growth rates for the industry proves true.

There are credible arguments to be made against high-profit margins in the marijuana industry. These include the fact that market entry barriers are not overly high — there are no substantial network effects entry costs are not overly large and there are no big technological advantages — and the fact that marijuana is an agricultural good.

Margins in the agricultural industry are notoriously low. Half of all agricultural businesses generate operating profit margins (before interest expenses and before taxes) of less than 5%. It is in no way guaranteed that the same will apply to the marijuana market but it is possible that industry-wide profits in the marijuana industry could be relatively meager despite a large market size.

In recent years we have already seen this play out to some degree. Despite further legalization of marijuana in additional countries and states the stocks of many cannabis companies have underwhelmed as profit margins are slim for many of these companies and since valuations were too high which caused multiple compression headwinds over the years.

Investing In The Marijuana Industry

There are a large number of publicly traded marijuana companies with the biggest ones being located in Canada which is not surprising as Canada is one of the largest markets where marijuana has been fully legalized. Companies in this segment have different strategies such as focusing on the medical marijuana market or certain geographic markets.

There are several ETFs which investors can choose if they are bullish on the industry as a whole and if they do not want to choose among single companies. The largest one of these ETFs is the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF (HMLSF) which has a current net asset value of CAD4.45 per share (May 2022).

The Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF has moved down since our last update. Share price declines in a range of cannabis stocks have caused its net asset value to decline and rising interest rates and high inflation lead to lower interest from investors when it comes to investing in oftentimes barely profitable growth stocks.

This ETF made two distributions in 2021 according to its fact sheet but its estimated annualized yield of 0.81% is not attractive for income investors and does not add meaningfully to the ETF’s total return potential. The Horizons Marijuana Life Science ETF has a relatively high expense ratio of 0.86% annually.

‘Pure Play’ Marijuana Stocks

Investors who are interested in this space can choose from a large list of publicly traded companies with direct exposure to the marijuana market i.e. marijuana pure plays. These are companies which derive all or a vast majority of their revenues from the sale of marijuana and marijuana products for medical use and/or for recreational use.

Many large players in this segment are Canada-based but US-based companies with meaningful market capitalizations exist as well. Outside of North America there are no large players in this space since other countries where (medical) marijuana has been legalized do oftentimes import marijuana from North American companies instead of producing marijuana “at home”.

Most marijuana companies do not have a long history of revenues or earnings because the legal marijuana industry is still relatively young. It seems likely that those marijuana companies with the highest sales base and the largest production capacity have the greatest chance of generating above-average margins in the future. Reasons for this include economics of scale operating leverage and the fact that those with the most experience are likely the best at bringing down costs of production.

On the other hand investors should be careful not to overpay for stocks – which is why the price for a stock should always be looked at relative to metrics such as the earnings or the cash flows that the company generates (on a per-share basis).

This is the list of 10 of the largest pureplay marijuana companies by revenue generation:

Aurora Cannabis (ACB)

Canopy Growth (CGC)

Tilray (TLRY)

Cronos (CRON)

Organigram (OGRMF)

Cresco Labs (CRLBF)

Curaleaf Holdings (CURLF)

Green Thumb Industries (GTBIF)

Trulieve Cannabis (TCNNF)

Columbia Care (CCHWF)

Aphria which was one of the largest marijuana companies originally got taken over by Tilray since our last update. Of these our top three picks are the following ones:

Marijuana Pure Play Stock: Trulieve Cannabis Corp

Trulieve Cannabis Corp isn’t the largest marijuana pureplay company by far. But its profitability is compared to most of its peers outstanding which makes it interesting for investors. Trulieve Cannabis operates as a medical cannabis company that cultivates produces and distributes its products itself through dispensaries in its home market Florida but over the years Trulieve Cannabis has also ventured into other markets including California Arizona Nevada and a couple more.

Source

According to its own data Trulieve sells roughly half of the medical marijuana that is sold in Florida despite operating only one-fourth of the dispensaries in the state. Its scale and large market share especially in its most important market allows Trulieve Cannabis to operate with margins that are stronger than what we see from most of its peers.

For the current fiscal year 2022 Trulieve Cannabis is forecasting revenue of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $450 to $500 million. This does not only point to a pretty solid EBITDA margin in the 30% range but the $450+ million EBITDA generation that is expected for the current year also results in a valuation that doesn’t seem high at all. The company’s market capitalization stands at $2.7 billion which means that it is valued at around 6x this year’s expected adjusted EBITDA. Of course net profits are considerably smaller due to depreciation taxes etc. But still Trulieve Cannabis is one of the more profitable cannabis companies and surprisingly inexpensive at the same time.

Marijuana Pure Play Stock: Canopy Growth

Canopy Growth is by market capitalization one of the largest cannabis companies in Canada. One of the poster children of the cannabis investing boom (or bubble) a couple of years ago its price and market capitalization have pulled back considerably over the last couple of years. That has made its valuation improve which is why it seems like a significantly better investment today.

Canopy Growth isn’t profitable unlike Trulieve but is generating solid revenue of around $400 to $500 million per year and the company has recently announced new cost-cutting measures. Combined with some organic revenue growth that should improve profitability over the years all else equal.

Canopy Growth has also been shifting its product portfolio towards branded consumer goods such as its sports nutrition products under the BioSteel label:

BioSteel and some of Canopy Growth’s other branded products had a record quarter in Q1 which indicates that its shift towards this products could help improve Canopy’s business growth over time. This strategy could help differentiate Canopy Growth from its peers over the years and as long as its brands are attractive they could also help Canopy Growth generate improving margins over time compared to the relatively commoditized pure cannabis production business.

Marijuana Pure Play Stock: Cresco Labs

Cresco Labs Inc. cultivates manufactures and sells both medical and retail cannabis products in US states where it is allowed to do so. Its products include flowers vape pens extracts concentrates but also shakes and popcorn. Not surprisingly the company is active in a wide range of US markets including in important ones such as Florida or California:

Source

The company generates compelling business growth as its revenue rose by 20% during the most recent quarter. EBITDA meanwhile was up by 45% year over year climbing to $51 million. That makes for a 24% EBITDA margin which is a little less than that of Trulieve but which is still far from bad.

Based on its current EBITDA run rate Cresco Labs is valued at around 6x EBITDA which is more or less in line with Trulieve’s valuation. It should be noted that Cresco Labs is not expected to be profitable on a GAAP net profit basis this year due to depreciation taxes interest expenses etc. That’s to be expected and holds true for almost all cannabis companies however. Thanks to its encouraging growth and solid EBITDA margins Cresco Labs should be able to reach GAAP profitability in the not too distant future we believe.

Indirect-Exposure Marijuana Stocks

Marijuana pure play stocks have the problem that their valuations are not low at all and that most of these companies are not profitable yet. It is also not guaranteed that they will (all) become profitable (due to possible margin pressures for the industry). Last but not least investors don’t get any meaningful dividend yields from marijuana pure play stocks.

For investors that don’t want to invest in marijuana pure play stocks due to the reasons outlined above and that seek exposure to the growing marijuana industry nevertheless one possibility is to invest in stocks that are not marijuana pure plays but that have some exposure to the industry nevertheless.

This primarily includes consumer goods companies (beverage stocks tobacco stocks) that have ventured into the marijuana space but that continue to generate the majority of their revenues and earnings in another industry. Our top five picks among these companies are analyzed below.

Indirect Marijuana Exposure Stock: AbbVie

AbbVie (ABBV) is a biotech company that is active in oncology and immunology primarily. AbbVie generates revenues of more than $50 billion annually and is highly profitable with its biggest drug Humira playing an important role in both revenue and earnings generation.

AbbVie is seen by some as one of the first medical marijuana companies as its drug Marinol was the first FDA-approved cannabis drug. Marinol is used for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in patients enduring chemotherapy. Marinol is also used for increasing appetite in patients with HIV/AIDS or certain cancers.

Marinol was not a large revenue driver for AbbVie in the past as other drugs were larger in terms of their addressable market and when it comes to the prices the company could demand for them. AbbVie also sold Marinol to Alkem Labs a while ago. One can argue whether AbbVie should be seen as a marijuana stock but the company has been interested in the space and had FDA-approved products on the market. It seems possible that AbbVie develops new products that utilize marijuana in the future although there is no guarantee of that.

Investors don’t have the high risks that are associated with an investment into a marijuana pure play but might still benefit from growth of the medical marijuana industry. AbbVie trades at an inexpensive valuation of just 11 times 2022’s profits right now. AbbVie also offers a sizeable dividend yield of 3.7% right here. Due to its yield its low valuation and its share price upside potential AbbVie is one of our favorite Dividend Aristocrat buys today.

Indirect Marijuana Exposure Stock: Altria

Altria (MO) is one of the largest tobacco companies in the world. Altria produces and sells cigarettes under the Marlboro brand in the US. The company also sells several other cigarette brands cigar brands and non-smokeable tobacco products to round out the company’s product portfolio. In addition Altria owns a 10% stake in Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) which is one of the world’s largest beer companies.

As a tobacco company Altria is primed for an expansion into the marijuana space which is why the company has taken a stake in Canadian marijuana company Cronos. In December 2018 Altria agreed to pay $1.8 billion for a 45% stake in Cronos. Additionally Altria has an option to acquire another 10% at a fixed price. Since then there has been speculation that Altria might make a bid to take over Cronos entirely with these rumors boiling up again in 2021. So far no deal to acquire all of Cronos has been announced however and it is far from certain that such a deal will be crafted in the future.

Compared to Altria’s market capitalization of $96 billion its Cronos stake is not overly large but it provides an entry into this potentially large market. In case marijuana gets legalized in the US on a federal level Altria could likely expand into this space very fast thanks to the know-how that the company acquires through its stake in Cronos and through Altria’s established (tobacco) sales channels across all of the United States.

Altria is highly profitable trades at just 11 times 2022’s earnings and offers a hefty dividend yield of 7.1% which makes it a high dividend stock. We believe that Altria is a compelling pick for investors that seek an income investment with some potential upside through a side-venture in the marijuana space.

Indirect Marijuana Exposure Stock: Associated British Foods

Associated British Foods (ASBFY) is a London UK based company that is active in several industries. The company operates in the sugar production and agricultural industries but it also produces beverages cereals and other food products. Last but not least Associated British Foods has established itself as a low-cost apparel retailer with its Primark brand.

Associated British Foods has ventured into the marijuana industry by becoming a marijuana cultivator and supplier to the medical industry. Unlike many marijuana pure plays Associated British Foods is highly profitable and produces sizeable cash flows thanks to its other businesses which means that this is a lower-risk stock that could potentially grow its marijuana business at a fast pace through organic investments thanks to its cash generation from other business units.

As Associated British Foods is experienced in growing farm products and producing snacks and beverages which gives the company the potential to introduce marijuana-containing products snacks and beverages the expansion into the marijuana industry seems like a reasonable move.

Associated British Foods which is valued at $16 billion today trades at 13 times this year’s earnings which is not a high valuation at all. Associated British Foods offers a dividend yielding 2.7% which is more than what investors can get from the broad market. The company has raised its dividend regularly and at an ample pace in the past.

Indirect Marijuana Exposure Stock: Constellation Brands

Constellation Brands (STZ) is one of the largest alcoholic beverages companies in the world. Constellation Brands is focused on the wine and spirits markets but it owns a small beer segment as well.

Constellation Brands made news when the company announced a $4 billion investment in Canadian marijuana company Canopy Growth. This deal diluted Canopy Growth’s existing shareholders but it gave Constellation Brands a substantial position in the marijuana industry.

Constellation Brands sees significant potential for marijuana-infused beverages and due to its experience in the beverages industry and its existing sales networks Constellation Brands will likely become one of the biggest players in this (potentially large) market.

Even if this venture does not work out Constellation Brands would remain a profitable company and investors would likely not suffer too much from a failure in this space. Today Constellation Brands trades at 21 times this year’s earnings which isn’t cheap but which also isn’t especially expensive compared to how many other alcoholic beverages companies are valued.

Investors get a dividend that yields 1.4% from Constellation Brands which is not really a lot but better than what one receives from pure-play cannabis stocks as those generally make no dividend payments at all. At the same time the stake in Canopy Growth allows for substantial upside potential in case things go well.

Indirect Marijuana Exposure Stock: Molson Coors

Molson Coors (TAP) is a beverage company as well but unlike Constellation Brands it is focused on the global beer market. Molson Coors which is based in Denver CO has moved into the marijuana industry through a joint venture with Hydropothecary a Canada-based marijuana producer. The joint venture focuses on producing marijuana-containing but alcohol-free beverages.

The join venture first moved into the Canadian market when it was legal to do so but international expansion was only natural and additional market should get added over time as cannabis gets legalized in more and more countries and states. Due to Molson Coors’ existing global sales networks it is likely that the venture between Molson Coors and Hydropothecary would be able to capture significant market share in overseas markets if the opportunity arises e.g. when additional countries in Europe or South America legalize marijuana/marijuana products.

Molson Coors is trading at a relatively inexpensive valuation of just 13 times 2022’s earnings and investors get paid a dividend yield of 2.1% at current prices.

The Best Marijuana Stocks

The marijuana industry is still young which means that both risks and potential rewards are elevated.

In the pure play space Trulieve Cannabis looks inexpensive relative to other marijuana pure plays while at the same time it is operating with above-average profitability which reduces financial risks to some degree. Legal and regulatory risks remain of course.

Marijuana pure play companies are mostly not profitable and do not pay dividends. More risk-averse investors with a goal of steady income generation should rather look at companies with some indirect marijuana exposure.

This list includes established companies with long and steady dividend growth records that will be more suitable for many investors compared to the higher-risk pure plays.

Among those stocks with indirect exposure there are several ones that are reasonably to attractively priced and that offer an above-average dividend yield on top of that. These companies give investors the ability to benefit from future growth opportunities in the marijuana industry without taking on a lot of risk.

Of these Altria is our favorite indirect exposure marijuana stock in May 2022 thanks to its low valuation and strong total return outlook driven by its outstanding dividend yield of more than 7%. Its marijuana exposure is not as large as that of pure plays of course but in case marijuana gets legalized on a federal level in the US Altria still could be a major beneficiary. The fact that it is a Dividend Aristocrats that has raised the dividend like clockwork for several decades is also a highly attractive trait for many income investors.

Final Thoughts

When it comes to marijuana there is a clear trend of decriminalization and outright legalization for both medicinal and recreational purposes in the U.S. and across the globe. This means that the potential market for legal marijuana continues to grow.

That said investors should not blindly jump into this industry based solely on the market potential. Many of the companies in this industry are not profitable and may never reach profitability. As a result investing in marijuana stocks is fraught with risk. It is not guaranteed that all major marijuana companies (some of which are valued at several billion dollars) will grow into their valuations in a reasonable amount of time.

Investors should take a close look at all relevant data points before making any decisions especially in a higher-risk environment such as the marijuana industry. Choosing lower-risk stocks which allow for some indirect exposure to the industry could be an opportune move for investors especially for those that desire regular and reliable dividend income from their stock holdings.
