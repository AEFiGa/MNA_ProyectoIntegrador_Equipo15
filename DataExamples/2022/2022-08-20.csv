Familiarity

Value

Cash

Shale

CEO

Inflation Reduction Act









Famed investor Warren Buffett is steadily snowballing a stake in Occidental Petroleum Corp. in what could end up being his biggest-ever acquisition. His Berkshire Hathaway Inc. on Friday won approval to buy as much as 50% of the shares. Some investors believe it’s a step toward a full takeover which may end up costing more than $50 billion.Here’s why Occidental is attractive to Berkshire:Inflation looks to be the mega-trend for the first half of the 2020s and crude oil is one of the best natural hedges out there. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and a lack of investment in new oilfields over the past five years have hit supplies leading to stagnant production profiles everywhere from OPEC to US shale. Meanwhile demand for fossil fuels has been strong coming out of the pandemic even as governments push for a switch to clean energy.With investments across the energy sector from utilities to solar power Buffett claims to be a realist in the debate around fossil fuels. “People that are on the extremes of both sides are a little nuts” he said at a Berkshire shareholder meeting in 2021.Buffett first invested in Occidental in 2019 when the oil company was in a bidding war with Chevron Corp. to buy its crosstown Houston rival Anadarko. Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub flew to Omaha Nebraska on the company’s Gulfstream V and convinced Buffett to add $10 billion to her war chest. It was enough to swing the deal and Chevron pulled out soon after. In exchange Buffett got preferred shares yielding 8% annually plus warrants to buy more common stock at $59.62 apiece. Today with Occidental at $71.29 those warrants would turn a profit of more than $900 million if exercised.Initially the Anadarko deal was a disaster because it loaded up Occidental’s balance sheet with more than $30 billion of additional debt right before the pandemic. Occidental’s market value went from $50 billion before the 2019 transaction to less than $9 billion toward the end of 2020 as oil prices crashed.But on the flip side this created a good value play for Buffett. When crude turned around late last year and was supercharged by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine Occidental was best-placed to benefit. The stock is the best performer in the S&P 500 this year up more than 140% compared with the index’s 11% decline.“Oxy started this year heavily indebted with massive oil exposure” said Bill Smead who manages $4.8 billion at Smead Capital Management Inc. and is a top 20 shareholder in Occidental. Soaring crude prices mean “they’re now paying off that debt and gushing cash. It’s the best of all worlds.”Too much cash has been Berkshire’s biggest investing challenge over the past few years. The conglomerate had about $105 billion on hand at the end of June. It is expected to generate about $8 billion in free cash flow each quarter for the next five years according to Greggory Warren of Morningstar Research Services LLC. Inflation at the highest in 40 years is a great incentive to put that money to work.Occidental would work better as a subsidiary of Berkshire than a stock holding “given the volatility that exists in the energy/commodity markets” Warren said. “This could end up though evolving into a slow-motion takeover where Berkshire buys up to the stakes that FERC allows it to acquire until it can acquire Oxy whole.”Occidental is not only one of the biggest producers in the Permian Basin the largest US oilfield but it also has one of the lowest costs with an oil price of just $40 a barrel needed to sustain its dividend. West Texas Intermediate currently trades at about $90 a barrel. Hollub has reined in the “drill-baby-drill” mentality that characterized shale for the first decade of its lifespan and is now prioritizing profits over production. Free cash flow hit a record $4.2 billion in the second quarter.The Anadarko purchase may have been expensive but it allowed Occidental to lift its land holdings in the Permian to 2.8 million acres 14 times the size of New York City’s five boroughs combined. It also added steady cash-flowing assets in the Gulf of Mexico and Algeria.Buffett has a good personal relationship with Hollub which began at the 2019 meeting in Omaha brokered by Bank of America Corp. CEO Brian Moynihan. This year the veteran investor praised Hollub after reading a transcript of Occidental’s Feb. 25 earnings conference call in which she pledged financial discipline even as oil prices were rising.“I read every word and said this is exactly what I would be doing” Buffett told CNBC’s Becky Quick in “Squawk Box” in March. “She’s running the company the right way.”The oil industry mostly criticized the Inflation Reduction Act that President Joe Biden signed into law this month. The $437 billion legislation “discourages needed investment in oil and gas” and offers “the wrong policies at the wrong time” the American Petroleum Institute said.But Hollub was surprisingly upbeat calling the bill “very positive.” That may have something to do with its expansion of tax credits for carbon capture of which Occidental is a leading proponent. The company has plans to build the world’s biggest direct air capture plant which will command a tax credit of as much as $180 for each ton of carbon sucked out of the air.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3RoZWNvbnZlcnNhdGlvbi5jb20vdGhlLWJpZy1mb3VyLW9pbHNhbmRzLWNvbXBhbmllcy1pbmZsdWVuY2UtdGhyZWF0ZW5zLWFsYmVydGEtZGVtb2NyYWN5LWFyZ3Vlcy1wb2xpdGljYWwtc2NpZW50aXN0LTE4ODU2N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Big Four oilsands companies' influence threatens Alberta democracy argues political scientist,"Over the past five years ownership of oilsands production has become hyperconcentrated in four companies: Cenovus Energy Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNRL) Imperial Oil Limited and Suncor Energy.

These four producers — known as the Big Four — account for about 84 per cent of Alberta’s daily production of 3.3 million barrels of bitumen a type of crude oil found in oilsands deposits.

Not only that but it is the oilsands that have driven Alberta’s economy and finances for the past two decades. According to Alberta’s 2022 budget oilsands production will make up 87 per cent of the province’s total oil production as conventional fields empty.

In the face of growing environmental concerns and regulatory requirements some international companies have decided to exit the oilsands. Between 2016 and 2019 foreign oil companies Chevron Shell BP and Statoil sold their oilsands holdings.

But other major Canadian producers like CNRL and Cenovus Energy have doubled down. They see the emission-intensive extraction operation as a golden opportunity to dominate an increasingly single-industry province.

As a political scientist who has worked in a large Alberta-based financial institution and the provincial treasury department I am familiar with the booms and busts of Alberta’s economy and its correlation to provincial finances. The financial dependence of the Alberta government on bitumen royalties has increased enormously over the past several years.

An industry flush with cash

By comparing the amount of bitumen royalties and corporate income taxes from the Big Four to Alberta’s total revenue it is possible to estimate the province’s fiscal dependency on these companies.

The numbers show that no province other than perhaps New Brunswick with its dominant Irving family comes near Alberta’s level of corporate fiscal dependency.

The revenue expected from the Big Four oilsands producers in 2022 assuming an average per barrel price of $115 will be a staggering $116 billion — about 25 per cent of Alberta’s GDP.

During the first half of 2022 Imperial Oil Cenovus Energy CNRL and Suncor Energy have reported net income of $17.1 billion.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jonathan Hayward

What is less understood is what this vast increase in revenue means for the Alberta treasury and to a lesser extent the federal government.

During the first six months of 2022 the Big Four paid an estimated $8 billion in royalties to the Alberta government. Most of their $6.8 billion in income tax expenses went to the federal government with the remaining 30 per cent going to the Alberta government.

Since Alberta has the lowest corporate tax rate in the country this creates an enormous incentive for these companies to create as much taxable income as possible. The taxes and royalties so far this year amount to about $10 billion which would easily pay for Alberta’s K-12 education system.

Lining the government’s pockets

The concentration of economic and financial power in the Big Four means Alberta’s next premier must heed the needs of these massive oilsands players. As oil prices rise the financial dependency of the provincial treasury on the Big Four will grow.

Alberta’s 2022 budget adopted a very conservative oil price estimate of US$70 per barrel which deliberately understated the expected surplus. It estimated bitumen royalties would return $10.3 billion during the fiscal year.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jeff McIntosh

For every dollar above this US$70 per barrel estimate an additional $500 million in oil royalties will flow to the government. At US$100 a barrel an additional $9 billion in bitumen royalties would be paid but with oil prices averaging US$116 since April 1 an additional $23 billion in oil and gas royalties could roll in.

Using this conservative oil price forecast Alberta’s budget estimated its total revenue will be $52 billion. In reality its revenue will likely be much higher.

The Big Four contribute about 20 per cent of Alberta’s total revenue. At US$100 per barrel the Big Four contribute about 30 per cent of the province’s revenue and at US$116 per barrel the contribution exceeds 30 per cent. This gives these companies an enormous amount of control over Alberta’s finances and by extension politics.

Pathways Alliance

The Big Four’s political influence has most recently manifested in its dominant position in the Pathways Alliance. This lobbying consortium — known as COSIA — consists of the Big Four ConocoPhillips and MEG Energy.

According to their website COSIA’s purpose is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from oilsands production and achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions. The Pathways Alliance sees oilsands production carrying on for nearly three decades and beyond.

Central to this lobby effort has been successfully convincing Ottawa to give the firms a tax credit in the 2022 federal budget. This sets a dangerous precedent — if Ottawa itself is willing to grant the wishes of the Big Four what chance will the Alberta premier have in refusing similar requests?

The fiscally dependent Alberta government will continue its battles against Ottawa on behalf of the Big Four. Whether or not this is good for Alberta’s democracy its residents and the planet is another matter entirely.",,,

Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Chicago has been around for 125 years and acted as the primary church for three surrounding neighborhoods of Ashland Avenue.

The church held its first mass in October 1892 and was physically moved in 1929.

It took the efforts of 50 men and their horses to pry the 10000 ton church from its foundation move it across the street and rotate it 90 degrees. According to a Chicago Ancestry site the church was moved at a 'foot a minute.'

'It is a magnificent historically and architecturally significant church' said church preservation advocate Julie Sawacki on the steps leading to the church's entrance. 'Imagine tearing something so significant down.'

The church in its present form was built in 1916 and moved across a street by 50 men and horses in 1929

The Archdiocese of Chicago told CBS News that attendance at the church's Sunday masses have steadily declined.

The church simultaneously needs $2 million worth of repairs and without the community's support its likely it will be demolished.

There are a group of parishioners including Hilda Correa who are desperately trying to save the famed religious landmark. Correa and others say the church attracts tourists both Christian and non-Christian.

Correa also alluded to the fact that times are hard. Although she didn't specify what she was talking about - perhaps the years-long pandemic or stubborn inflation - Correa says the church is a place of comfort for those who come to visit.

Hilda Correa left and Julie Sawacki right as well as a number of others passionate about keeping Our Lady of Lourdes alive made impassioned pleas on the steps of the church before its last service on May 19

'The religious aspect is really what's really touching us because losing such a valuable place that people can come especially in these days...'

Our Lady of Lourdes will be holding its final service on May 19 but Preservation Chicago a non-profit organization dedicated to saving city landmarks plans to revive the church and make it into a holy shrine.

'The effort here will probably be long and labored perhaps. There's a lot of different moving parts and a lot of different factors' said Preservation Chicago Executive Director Ward Miller.

There is a Change.org petition with 1107 signatures to preserve the church as a historical landmark rather than knocking it down.

According to Mail Online Oluronbi originally from Nigeria and living in Birmingham was found guilty of the offences against six women and a man in January actions described by a judge as 'one of the worst cases of sexual abuse of multiple children to come before the courts'.

Some of his offences were carried out after he convinced victims five of whom attended his church to take part in 'spiritual bathing' which he claimed would 'cleanse' them of evil spirits.

During the trial at Birmingham Crown Court a jury heard that some of his young female victims who became pregnant multiple times were taken to abortion clinics by qualified pharmacist Oluronbi to cover up what was happening.

He was convicted of 15 counts of rape seven counts of indecent assault and two counts of sexual assault.

The jury heard that there were at least 88 separate occasions on which he raped his victims.

His wife Juliana was convicted of three counts of aiding and abetting rape after helping arrange some of the terminations. She was also jailed for 11 years for helping her husband.

'Everything was my fault' admits pastor in video confession

In a confession videoed last year by a victim's family member who had confronted him the pastor is heard saying: 'Everything was just my fault and as I said before I wasn't meant to be human.

'I wasn't meant to live under the roof of any human being and I said that I was an animal.'

The footage was released by West Midlands Police after the trial.

The victim's relative is then heard off-camera asking the pastor: 'You know I said that you are a paedophile? Everyone knows that you're a paedophile. You know that that's the name they give to your type?'

Oluronbi who appears on camera in a formal shirt and tie speaking animatedly raising his hands but with his eyes shut then replies: 'Fine.'

He also claims the devil made him carry out the abuse.

Despite the recording Oluronbi denied any wrongdoing during the trial forcing his victims to give evidence against him during nine weeks of legal proceedings.

He even laughed in the witness box while giving his own evidence.

Judge Sarah Buckingham said the real purpose of the 'spiritual baths' was to 'fulfil your insatiable sexual appetite'.

Oluronbi and his wife will be required to sign the sex offenders' register for life.

Sentencing Oluronbi on Friday Judge Buckingham said: 'You claimed that God was instructing you to conduct holy baths.

'Its real purpose was to fulfil your insatiable sexual appetite.

'The children feared you and this enabled you to continue your grip.

'Your offending has had an extreme and severe impact on all of your complainants.

'Any attempt to suggest otherwise would be without foundation.

'You abused your position of trust - they trusted you like God.'

The judge continued: 'You did this because you are an arrogant selfish and vain man.

'In my judgment your offending must be one of the worst cases of sexual abuse of multiple children to come before the courts.'

One of his victims now an adult had come forward to help bring Oluronbi to justice.

In statements read to the court by the prosecution one of the victims said the defendant's actions made her 'question if my life was worth living'.

Jurors also heard Oluronbi was linked to a Christian church in Edgbaston Birmingham the Cherubim and Seraphim Church whose roots were in Nigeria.

He set up his own splinter group for about 40 adults and children separate from the church and located at another address where he began a practice of 'spiritual bathing'.

The offences took place in Birmingham and London.

Phil Bradley QC prosecuting told the jury that the main tactic he employed was to claim that God had instructed him to administer 'holy baths' to some of his congregation to 'cleanse' them and protect them from evil influences.

He added that for some of the female victims it 'progressed to repeated rapes on many occasions leading to unwanted pregnancies and terminations'.

Oluronbi's victims described him as 'controlling' and 'almost like a king'.

The offending happened over a period of 20 years at various locations going back to the 1980s.

Oluronbi was arrested at Birmingham Airport in May last year while trying to leave the country for Nigeria with some of his ceremonial belongings and a sum of cash.

Police are unable to say whether he was trying to flee justice but pointed out he had recently been confronted about the abuse by one of his victims.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9hZHZpY2UvMjAyNC8wNS8xMC9jYXJvbHluLWhheC1pbi1sYXdzLWxpdmUtc3RyZWFtLWNodXJjaC1hdHRlbmRhbmNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Advice | Carolyn Hax: In-laws stalk the live stream to check couple's attendance at church,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.washingtonpost.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /advice/2024/05/10/carolyn-hax-in-laws-live-stream-church-attendance/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159BA33C3D0>, 'Connection to www.washingtonpost.com timed out.

Katie Haas CEO of the W&S Open said the tournament brings in millions each year to the Greater Cincinnati area. She said people start bringing in money as soon as they get off their plane into town.

“There’s actually great welcoming messaging at CVG this year as a partner of ours the airport is"" Haas said. ""As soon as those fans those players step off the plane at CVG that’s really when the tournament experience starts and they go and get their rental car and they go and check into their hotel room and then they go and spend money in the restaurants so that economic impact is starting as soon as they land.""

Haas noted they don’t have a total of how much money the tournament has generated this year but added that this past week has been the highest rate of occupancy for hotels in Warren and Butler counties.

It’s the final day of the Western & Southern Open. There are still some tickets left but there aren’t many. The first finals match starts at noon.

In 2017 the tennis tournament conducted a study and found the regional financial economic impact was $65 million during the week of the Western & Southern Open. Haas added the tournament has also donated millions to charity.

“This tournament has donated close to $12 million for local non-profits in the community and that’s a tradition we take great pride in and we’ll continue again this year” Haas said.

Some of the funds generated go to Cincinnati Children’s Hospital the Barrett Cancer Center and Tennis for City Youth.

Haas said they saw a 30% drop in attendance last year because of COVID but said six days into the tournament that 150000 people have attended.

“We have ticket buyers from all 50 states and 30 countries so we really do welcome the world to Greater Cincinnati every year for this event not only are spending money at hotels they’re spending money at restaurant shops” Haas said.

She said their furthest season ticket holder travels from South Africa to attend the tournament.

The first finals match for the tournament is set to start at noon.

That said despite its many virtues and ambitious grand-scale staging strong voices daring swordplay flamenco gypsy dances lavish costumes a tale of bitter sibling rivalry political oppression and romance plus the rousing music of the Gipsy Kings (including the irresistible “Bamboleo”) this take on the “Zorro” story needs work.

The script penned by Stephen Clark and Helen Edmundson (based on a novel by the esteemed writer Isabel Allende) could benefit from some serious tightening. To put it simply the show — energetically directed by Adrian Abel Azevedo with music direction by Justin Kono — is just too long.

The story of the fabled “masked man” is set primarily in the Spanish settlement of the early 1800s known as the Pueblo de Los Angeles. It begins as Don Alejandro (Luis A. Galvez) the aging father of Diego (Cisco Lopez) decides to send his son to Barcelona Spain for the higher education that will prepare him to become the Pueblo’s future leader. Meanwhile the resentful Ramon (Emmanuel Ramirez) a contemporary of Diego grabs power imprisons Don Alejandro and turns into a cruel tyrannical dictator in the colony.

Diego who early on captured the heart of Luisa (Laura Quinones) the young woman in the Pueblo who adores him and who he must leave behind becomes entranced by the Spanish gypsy community he encounters in Barcelona and by Inez (Alix Rhode) the hot-blooded flamenco dancer who pursues him and is very different from Luisa.

But when Diego returns to Los Angeles (along with Inez and her friends) he learns of his father’s imprisonment and is determined to liberate both him and the citizens of the Pueblo. Disguised by what will become his emblematic black cape and mask and by the superb swordsmanship he picked up in Spain Diego assumes the guise of Zorro (Spanish for “Fox”) and at every possible turn tries to defeat Ramon and his soldiers. Luisa does not realize who he really is but is attracted to the man who comes out of nowhere dares to fight Ramon and can never be pinned down as he attempts to rid the Pueblo of its ruthless dictator.

As Diego/Zorro Lopez is tireless as he fights injustice wields his sword against multiple enemies and tries to deal with the two women in his life. Quinones and Rhode both have powerhouse voices and capture the very different personalities of Luisa and Inez. A trio of Flamenco dancers (Lina Bulovaite Jocelyn Leving and Karla Tennies Koziura) is superb with choreography by Luis Beltran Urena. Nick Sandys’ fight choreography is full of derring-do. And Diego Salcedo’s onstage guitar work sets the mood for many scenes.

As Ramon Ramirez captures the spirit of a cold-blooded dictator Galvez suggests the wisdom and forbearance of a man who has seen it all and J. Christian Hill deftly suggests the ambivalent sentiments of Garcia who plays Ramon’s underling.

Adriana Diaz’s character-defining costumes and the set design by Jacqueline & Richard Penrod capture the story’s two worlds: a long-ago Los Angeles and the flamboyant spirit of Barcelona and its gypsy culture.

Clearly there is much to admire in this production but it would definitely benefit from a good reworking and tightening of its script.

On Sunday at Citizens Bank Park in his major league debut he issued a denial to Philadelphia Phillies hitters.

Fisher sparkled in pitching three scoreless innings Mark Canha hit two homers and drove in five runs and the New York Mets rallied past Philadelphia 10-9.

""It's pretty surreal right now"" Fisher said. ""I'm so thankful and so blessed for the opportunity. It hasn't even sunk in yet.""

Fisher allowed one hit while striking out one and walking two.

""This is my dream"" he said.

The 26-year-old lefty went undrafted out of the University of Nebraska before pitching in 12 games at Class A for the Seattle Mariners organization in 2019.

With the uncertainty of COVID-19 halting his baseball career Fisher followed a former coach into banking in 2020 in his hometown of Omaha. Fisher worked there until June 2021 when he re-signed with the Mariners making it all the way to Triple-A.

This season with the Mets organization Fisher was 0-1 with a 3.77 ERA in 12 games at Double-A Binghamton and 1-2 with a 3.12 ERA in 12 games at Triple-A Syracuse before his call-up prior to Sunday's game.

""It's pretty cool"" Mets manager Buck Showalter said.

When Fisher entered in the fifth he caught more than a few people by surprise.

""I didn't even know who this guy was when he came into the game today"" Canha said.

Fisher retired three batters and walked one. He then walked Kyle Schwarber to lead off the sixth before being forced to sit out a 46-minute rain delay. Fisher returned and got three straight outs and he finished by facing the minimum in a scoreless seventh.

For Fisher it was just another day at the office.

Tougher work environment?

""Probably the Phillies lineup -- but those days can get long at the bank too"" he said laughing.

The Mets trailed by four runs after one inning and one run heading into the ninth and Canha boosted the Mets up each time.

The left-field seats at Citizens Bank Park had Canha's name written all over them as he tied the game with a three-run home run in the seventh inning and then sent the Mets on their way to a topsy-turvy 10-9 win with a two-run shot off David Robertson in the top of the ninth in front of a divided crowd of 35801 fans.

Brandon Nimmo added one more critical long ball with two outs to spoil Tyler Cyr's debut and Edwin Diaz closed the door with his 28th save despite giving up his first earned run since June 18.

As Canha's second home run sailed into the seats Canha punctuated the Mets' series win by hoisting his bat several feet into the air along the first-base line.

""It’s nice to finally get in a groove where I’ve been getting a little bit hot and hitting some homers"" said Mark Canha who ran his season totals to 10 home runs and 47 RBI. ""The lack of power has been kind of frustrating but I realize it’s a journey. It’s kind of been a long haul for me to get to this point where I am in this season. I was just super happy to contribute and get one for the boys.""

The victory was the Mets' third over the Phillies in as many days and helped them to grab a four-game lead over the Braves who lost to the Astros in their series finale. It was an emotional win on the eve of a two-game series against the Yankees.

""It's a good club a really good team. Another one"" Buck Showalter said. ""We just played one we played one in Atlanta and we're going to play another one tomorrow. We'll grind it for nine innings and we'll see where the baseball gods take us.""

Canha finished 3-for-5 with two home runs five RBI and two runs in his biggest performance for the Mets in his first season with the team.

Nate Fisher makes long-awaited debut

From the bank to the big leagues Nate Fisher never gave up on his dream of pitching in the major leagues.

The 26-year-old left-hander went undrafted out of University of Nebraska-Lincoln before latching on in the lower ranks of the Mariners' farm system. He was released and took a finance job in 2021 before heading back to the minor leagues with the Mariners and joining the Mets' system in late May.

""Always believed in myself never got down on myself. I kept believing"" Fisher said. ""My family and support system is so amazing and so critical for that. I’m thankful for the people around me to keep me going when there was some uncertainty. I’m truly blessed for the opportunity.""

METS:Offense goes abruptly cold in second half of doubleheader to Phillies

On Saturday Fisher was called upon for a long relief appearance after another debutant right-hander Jose Butto struggled in four innings. The Nebraska native twirled three scoreless innings intersected by a 46-minute rain delay for another critical support performance for the Mets.

Fisher came on with the Mets trailing 7-4 in the bottom of the fifth inning and exited in a tie game after Canha's first home run off Connor Brogdon in the top of the seventh inning. The left-hander worked one more inning picking off Bryson Stott on a steal attempt and freezing Nick Moton on a high slider.

""It’s kind of indescribable. It’s pretty surreal right now"" Fisher said. ""I’m so thankful so blessed for the opportunity. It hasn’t even soaked in yet.""

Tough start for Jose Butto

Brett Baty's first start in Mets uniform will forever be stashed in fans' memories.

It was complete with a smooth swing that netted him a home run in his first major-league at-bat followed by the epic reaction from his family and friends in the ballpark at Truist Park.

Not every debut has the same story-book feel.

Butto learned that the hard way. The 24-year-old right-hander worked through a five-hit opening inning and gave up a pair of three-run home runs to Alec Bohm and an RBI single to Maton.

Butto was staggered throwing 38 pitches in his very first inning of his major-league career and one batter away from being removed. Each of the Phillies' first five batters reached base with Schwarber lining a single and Rhys Hoskins drawing a walk before Bohm's first blast. After three more hits Butto was able to get Matt Vierling to pop up and Bradley Zimmer to wave through a curveball.

The next two innings were a strong response with Butto settling in straying from the changeup and allowing only two hits.

""After that first inning I was able to settle in and I was able to execute my pitches a little better"" Butto said. ""I was able to get on the same page with the catcher and I felt like I had good results after that first inning.""

After the Mets tied the game at 4-4 a long fourth inning spelled disaster for Butto. Zimmer reached on an infield single and Schwarber walked before Bohm lashed his second home run of the day off the right-field foul pole. Butto closed his day with back-to-back strikeouts.

Rapid riser

Butto the Mets No. 15 prospect spent the majority of this season with Class AA Binghamton where he made 18 of his 20 starts. While he was there he notched a 6-5 record with a 4.00 ERA and 1.31 WHIP.

Butto only made two appearances with Class AAA Syracuse allowing three earned runs across five innings in his first start and being pulled after one inning three days before his debut.

It was similar to Baty's rapid rise. The 22-year-old third baseman only played six games in Syracuse before being called up.

But Butto did not have the same instant success and he will likely need to spend some time back with Syracuse before making another appearance with the Mets.

Eduardo Escobar Taijuan Walker progressing

Buck Showalter said he expects Eduardo Escobar who is dealing with a low-grade oblique strain to spend the minimum amount of time on the injured list.

The soonest that Escobar can return would be Aug. 16. Escobar's injury paired with Luis Guillorme missing time with a left groin strain paved the way for Baty's debut.

""He’s almost pain-free"" Showalter said. ""I think he’s going to make that on time for us.""

Meanwhile Taijuan Walker who is dealing with a went through fielding drills before Sunday's game which he was originally scheduled to pitch. Showalter said the team would wait to see how Walker felt following that workout before making a decision on when he will start next.

""You need to simulate what caused the injury"" Showalter said. ""You need to go through that which he did.""

Showalter added that Tomas Nido who has missed the last week on the COVID IL may need to make a catch a game elsewhere before returning for the Mets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzIxL25hdGUtZmlzaGVyLW1vbmV5LW91dC1vZi1tZXRzLWJ1bGxwZW4taW4tbGVmdHlzLW1sYi1kZWJ1dC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nate Fisher goes from banker to dazzling Mets debut in a year,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='nypost.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2022/08/21/nate-fisher-money-out-of-mets-bullpen-in-leftys-mlb-debut/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159B92663E0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzIxL25hdGUtZmlzaGVyLW1vbmV5LW91dC1vZi1tZXRzLWJ1bGxwZW4taW4tbGVmdHlzLW1sYi1kZWJ1dC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

It was loved for its calm interiors and smooth engine but above all the Maruti badge.

BHPian Shreyfiesta recently shared this with other enthusiasts.

Introduction:

The Maruti Esteem used to be one of the most familiar faces on Indian roads its lineage went back to the Maruti 1000 which was launched in 1990. In 1994 Maruti plonked the fabulous 1298cc all-aluminium engine into the 1000's body added a few cosmetic changes and the Esteem was born. Available with manual and automatic transmission options the Esteem quickly became the preferred set of wheels for senior management in the corporate world. Everyone loved the Esteem at one point of time and still do for its calm interiors and smooth engine but above all they loved the Maruti badge - a badge that over the years has come to stand for quality reliability and aspiration. The Esteem was battling the likes of the Hyundai Accent Ford Ikon and Opel Corsa in the early-2000s.

The sheer brand equity of the Maruti Suzuki brand name propelled the sales of the car and suddenly there were Esteems all over the place! At one point only the rich could afford an Esteem but today if you've got just enough money to put down on an iPhone 13 Pro this sedan can be yours for as little as ₹ 100000 for a mint-condition MPFI car. With a hefty 84bhp wrapped in a lightweight shell the Esteem MPFI was a rocket no less. The car was a tuner's favourite also in the late-nineties and if someone was looking at a good base car to start building a street-machine or just a commuter saloon with plenty of excitement an Esteem was the way to go during those days for sure.

It's been 14 years and a half since the last unit of Esteem rolled out of the production line. Production of the Esteem came to an end by December 2007 and the relevance of the model was almost completely outlawed due to the advent of Swift and Dzire. Yet the 'Esteem' remains as one of the most respected nameplates in India's automotive history. Time passes like a flash and I believe it's now time to look back at the story of the brand in India that too in a very detailed manner. So let's embark upon the journey of Esteem in a series of posts. This thread contains some of the brochures unseen advertisements and photos of the Esteem/1000 from the bygone era.

Also I would like to thank the following websites and groups for sharing those unseen treasure of images magazine articles and advertisements:

Chapter 1: Maruti 1000

Back in the early-90s the Maruti 1000 used to be the status symbol for many families in India. It was actually the first time the nation's largest car maker tried to sell a luxury car in our market. Did it really work? Was it better than the HM Contessa or the Premier 118 NE? Was that just a brand building tool for Maruti Udyog? Or was that a hoax from the company? Hang on. As the dust settles over the launches of more mid-size SUVs in our country we need to move back in time and ask some simple questions - Where have these good ol' sedans gone now? Have they been scrapped? Or have they been sold in small towns at a cheaper price?

Export-spec Maruti 1000's brochure from early-ninties shared by @addict_car on Twitter:

Indian Auto November 1989 issue's cover page featuring a Maruti 1000. Picture was shared on CME group by BHPian anjan_c2007:

Coming back to the topic. There was nothing wrong with the HM Ambassador too back then better known as the Amby these days. Yes there were about a million-odd car owners who chose nothing but a Maruti 1000 as their Ambys passed into old age. Nothing was against the cars like Premier Padmini and Ambassador except for the times. Maruti Udyog used to sell two small cars also at that time the 800 and the Omni and the smallest the 800 made strong economic sense for a country like India. Maruti 800 already had 90 percent local content by late-eighties and the sticker price was among the lowest one could ask for in a four-wheeler anywhere in the world.

Maruti 1000 being compared with HM Contessa and Premier 118NE by Indian Auto in June 1991:

When Maruti hurried the launch of its 1000cc sedan nobody realised that they were anticipating future events. Maruti 1000 was one of the first contemporary sedan-type cars launched in India. Back in the day it was the most expensive model in MUL's product range. The sedan was launched in November 1990 in three variants : Standard AC and GLX priced at ₹ 3.2lakh ₹ 3.4lakh and ₹ 3.5lakh ex-showroom respectively. The company had adopted a computerised lottery system to figure out who will own a Maruti 1000. Thereby it matched the taste of elite class for whom it was like a status symbol.

In fact there were rumours that the IT department was sending queries to all people who had booked a Maruti 1000. Most of the external changes in the 1000 adapted from the the three-box Suzuki Swift was perceived as cosmetic at first sight but the truth was that there was a purpose behind every changed curve. Spacious grey interiors of 1000 had moquette seats which added to the looks of cabin. Equipments like fabric upholstery floor carpets lockable fuel lid trunk room lamp and air-con were incorporated in this car. Superior White St.Germain Red Blue and Silver were the exterior body colour options offered initially. At the heart of Maruti 1000 lied a 1.0-litre carburetted petrol engine that churned out 46bhp at 5500rpm and 71Nm at 3500rpm mated with a 5-Speed manual gearbox. This engine was such a weakling for this car due to its weight measuring in 825 kg.

Maruti 1000's picture infront of Rashtrapati Bhavan from www.indiacontent.in:

996cc engine was a bit underpowered particularly with the AC switched on:

One major drawback that drivers encountered while manoeuvring the Maruti 1000 was the drop in its pick-up with air conditioning switched on. On the other side this sedan was good on fuel consumption. The car was actually perfect for those people who needed a cheap-to-run easy-to-maintain petrol saloon. While the power was just adequate to provide a decent driving experience it was a completely different story with the air-conditioner switched on when the engine felt positively underpowered. The addition of aftermarket free-flow exhaust kits noticeably improved power and driveability.

Ambience inside 1000's cabin was similar to that of an imported car back in the day. Here's a picture from the interior of BHPian mole's 1000:

The 1000 had an independent suspension setup at all four corners. The car used MacPherson strut units at the front and coil spring damper units in the back. 1000’s front suspension with its lower A-arm setup worked very well. The rear suspension which employed a lower arm and strut also performed well. Body construction in the 1000 was all-steel monocoque. The metal under the wiper spindle was prone to corrode due to collection of leaves and debris. Absorption of water and retention of moisture led to corrosion of the area in most cars. The engine suffered from having to ignite the fuel-air mixture by means of a contact-breaker point system. This required constant attention to correct the breaker gap for achieving an optimum spark.

The Tigers' Riley Greene had a 448-foot homer on the first pitch he saw from Angels starter Shohei Ohtani (10-8) — the longest home run Ohtani has allowed in the majors one that went over the out-of-town scoreboard in right-centerfield. Greene ended up reaching base four times.

Ohtani left the game with a stomach virus after four innings in which he allowed three runs on five hits and four walks.

Rodriguez (2-3) hadn't pitched in the majors since suffering a rib-cage injury on May 18. He left the team after a June 9 rehab assignment to deal with family issues and was on the restricted list until Friday.

Detroit's pitchers held the Angels scoreless in the final 15 innings of the series. Los Angeles had two on and two out in the third but Greene made a diving catch in center to rob Luis Rengifo of at least one RBI.

Ohtani retired the first two batters in the fourth but walked Akil Baddoo and Greene before Victor Reyes made it 3-0 with a triple. Kody Clemens increased the lead to 4-0 in the fifth with an RBI double off Jimmy Herget.

Ohtani the 2021 AL MVP was 10-7 with a 2.69 ERA entering the game.

Now that his first season as a full-time starter is complete the goalie is looking ahead to other challenges.

Here are 10 things to know about Oettinger:

Advertisement

1. College powerhouse

After growing up in Lakeville Minn. Oettinger committed to perennial college hockey powerhouse Boston University. BU has claim to five national championships and over a dozen players in the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame.

Oettinger played three seasons with the Terriers between 2016-19. He was awarded several honors including the 2018 Hockey East Tournament MVP after he helped lead BU to a conference championship.

After his junior season he joined the Texas Stars AHL team.

2. Dallas’ insane 2017 draft

The first three picks of the Stars’ 2017 NHL Entry Draft at this point look like the foundation upon which this franchise will be building for years to come.

With two first round selections Dallas first took defenseman Miro Heiskanen with the third overall pick then they traded up three spots from No. 29 to No. 26 and took Oettinger with that pick. With their second rounder No. 39 overall the Stars selected winger Jason Robertson.

Three picks now three core members of this team going forward.

3. Engaged in the summer

The game-changing goaltender made sure to start the 2023 offseason with a bang announcing his engagement to Kennedi Schumacher in June.

Oettinger posted two photos with Schumacher on Instagram to showcase the next step in their relationship.

4. Taking more steps forward

Oettinger first opportunity on the Stars’ roster came during the 2021-22 season. It’s safe to say he ran with the chance to start and hasn’t looked back.

Last season (his first as a full-time starter) the 24-year-old goalie finished with a career-best .919 save percentage and five shutouts. He finished the postseason with a 10-9 record and until Game 6 of the Western Conference finals he proved to be fantastic in elimination games.

5. Epic Game 7

The first round of the 2022 playoffs is where Oettinger really made a name for himself.

His .954 save percentage for the series helped the scrappy Stars nab three wins to force Game 7 where one of the best performances in the history of the NHL playoffs went for naught in a 3-2 overtime loss.

Oettinger had made 64 saves on 66 Flames shots before Calgary finally snuck in the 67th to end the Stars’ 2021-22 season. But they left it with a No. 1 goaltender locked in for next season.

6. Done deal

Locked into the starting spot and now cemented in as a member of the organization after signing the Dallas Stars signed him to a three-year contract worth $4 million annually.

Oettinger was a restricted free agent and made it clear that he wanted to remain with the Stars. Dallas had $12.5 million cap space available.

The short-term contract allows the Stars to watch Oettinger as a full-time starter in the NHL and gives Oettinger the appealing option of signing his next contract after the salary cap has gone up.

“Jake’s performance spoke for itself last season” Stars general manager Jim Nill said in a news release. “He has elite physical ability and presence in the net while also exhibiting phenomenal mental strength in high pressure situations.

“Jake’s poise and character off the ice have made him a leader in our locker room. He has shown that he has the skill work ethic and poise to excel at the NHL level. He was a key part of the team’s success last season and we’re excited to see him continue to grow here in Dallas.”

7. Nickname

The large majority of hockey nicknames are derived from taking the first syllable of a player’s last name and adding either an -y or an -er at the end (i.e. “Benner” “Seggy”).

Jake’s is no different as the moniker of “Otter” has been generally accepted among Stars fans. That it’s also the name of a cute animal is just a bonus.

8. Reaching milestones

Oettinger reached an impressive mark in Dec. 2022 having made 27 saves and coming within 14.3 seconds of a shutout in his 100th career game.

A string of strong starts returned Oettinger to the top of his game after a lower-body injury knocked him off at the end of October.

Oettinger said his key was “just not thinking and kind of playing.”

“Just I feel like the last two weeks or so I’ve played some of the best hockey of my career” Oettinger said after his 100th career game. “Even when you play well sometimes you don’t get rewarded. It’s a long process and I feel good about where my game’s at but it’s a lot of ups and downs throughout the season so it’s going good right now. Looking to keep it that way.”

When the Stars reached the postseason Oettinger found more magic. In Game 5 of a first-round series against the Minnesota Wild Oettinger recorded the first shutout of the playoffs through 34 games.

He also became the first goaltender in NHL postseason history to record a shutout against a team based in his birth state.

9. Particular when it comes to equipment

Early in the 2022-23 season Oettinger gave fans an in-depth look at the equipment he wears on a nightly basis. In a segment for Bally Sports Southwest the goaltender said his skates and glove are the pieces of gear that have stuck around with him for a while.

“Goalie skates are a little different than player skates. The blade is more like a triangle shape” Oettinger said. “I think that’s more for like digging into the ice. For me I’ve actually worn these skates for like two years. I hate breaking in new skates.”

On his glove: “I’ve used this glove for a long time like since college. The biggest thing I think is just the amount of padding and stuff that I change. Obviously with how hard guys can shoot it at this level I try to get as much padding as I can.”

10. Big golfer

Oettinger’s Instagram page features several pictures of him golfing with friends in various locations most recently at Pebble Beach.

La historia de Nikola Tesla es una mezcla de ficción y de realidad. En estos días de ajetreado movimiento de números alrededor del precio de la electricidad Nikola sería el gran protagonista.



Si preguntamos en la calle quien era Nikola Tesla nos resultaría difícil encontrar a alguien que sea consciente dela importancia de su trabajo.



Resulta difícil situar el nombre de Tesla. Algunos familiarizados con el magnetismo podrían reconocer en su apellido la unidad (tesla) que mide la intensidad de un campo magnético pero en realidad su nombre abre las puertas de un historia que está más cerca de las series de las plataformas televisivas que de la realidad.

Qué naciera un día de tormenta le convertiría en un hombre de luz sumido en su incomprendida oscuridad personal.Tesla domesticador de las leyes naturales veía enlas posibilidades de la electricidad la oportunidad para que la especie humana ascendiera a un nuevo nivel.



Bombillas clavadas directamente en el suelosin cables sin un aparente generador una luz milagrosa sin explicación terrenal esa era su idea. Convertir esto en la más poderosa herramienta de industrialización y civilizaciónpara todos pensando en el bien común.



¿Qué dirían las redes sociales de Nikola? Alabado y criticado ecologista radical visionario dueño de un trastorno populista...



Lejos de todo esto Nikola es y será uno de los pilares más importante de la industrialización y modernización de nuestra civilización. Descubrimientos y desarrollos tecnológicos que jamás podríamos haber pensado tienen su sello.

Justicia para la persona  para el científico para el visionario que quiso o dice la leyenda energía libre para todos.Paradoja de lo que actualmente estamos viviendo el mercadeo una vez más de una necesidad.



Quizá en un futuro  haya alguien con sus mismas capacidades y mejor suerte que nos lleve a otro mundo mágico energéticamente estable y accesible para todos.



Tesla nació el 10 de julio de 1856 en Similijan  Croacia. Era croata pero con descendencia serbia. Cursó numerosos estudios y más allá de su conocido enfrentamiento con Edison desarrolló diversas ideas que han servido para que se le reconozca como el «padre de la tecnología moderna» .Varios inventos que se basaron en sus conocimientos  los seguimos utilizando hoy en día.



Era el cuarto de 5 hermanos cuyos padres fueron Militum  sacerdote de la iglesia ortodoxa y Duka su madre que era analfabeta pero con una extraordinaria memoria. Secrió en un entorno bastante familiar y creció en el campo.



Su personalidad se caracterizaba por ser sinestésico y sufría un desorden obsesivo-compulsivo. Era muy exigente con la higiene y limpieza tanto que incluso mandaba a sus empleados a casa a cambiarse de ropa. Adoraba a los animales.



«Nuestras virtudes y nuestros defectos son inseparables como la fuerza y la materia. Cuando se separan el hombre no existe» es una de sus frases más conocida.



«Si la gente se mantiene despierta en vez de irse a dormir ocasiones no faltarán de que vean cosas aún más sorprendentes. Algún día no en este momento estaré en condiciones de anunciar algo que ni siquiera había imaginado» decía.



Su curriculum comienza en 1862 en la escuela politécnica de Gospic. Comenzó ingeniería en Graz Viena y continuó su formación en la Universidad de Praga.



En 1880 se traslada a Budapest y trabaja en una compañía de telégrafos.



En 1881 le nombran jefe de electricistas de la empresa y más tarde ingeniero responsable del primer sistema telefónico del país. Un año después decide viajar a París y comienza su trabajo como ingeniero en la Continental Edison Company donde concibe el Motor de Inducción.



En 1886 Nikola Tesla funda su propia compañía y los inversores no estuvieron de acuerdo con sus planes de desarrollo del motor de Corriente alterna relevándolo de su puesto. Trabaja como simple obrero con el fin de reunir capital suficiente para su próximo proyecto.



En 1889 construyó un laboratorio en Colorado Springs donde creó una torre de alta tensión para desarrollar la transmisión de la energía eléctrica sin cables y gratuita para todo el mundo.



Y en 1891 patentó la que sería su más famosa invención la base para la transmisión inalámbrica de corriente eléctrica conocida como la bobina de Tesla. Gracias a él se desarrolló el motor de inducción la centralhidroeléctrica los fluorescentes la transmisión inalámbrica la telegrafía sin hilos y la radio.



El 7 de enero de 1943 una empleada que trabajaba en el Hotel New Yorker entró en la habitación 3327 donde encontró el cuerpo sin vida de un hombre de 86 años que había vivido en el hotel durante la última década. Era Tesla. Como datos curiosos sobre su vida destaca que nació en un día de tormenta según la leyenda familiar la partera dijo a la mitad del nacimiento: este niño será un niño de la oscuridad a lo que su madre respondió no será un niño de la luz. Construyó una torre para enviar electricidad por el aire.

We have a lot of great Canadian dividend stocks Canadian bank stocks Canadian energy stocks etc.

But when it comes to tech stocks in Canada they only make up about 5-6% of our publicly traded stocks. (That’s according to the FTSE Canada All-Cap Index.) By comparison our financials sector is about 33% of our market and our energy sector is about 18%.

In the USA tech stocks make up over 26% of their entire stock universe (as measured by market cap) – and that is by far the largest sector in that very diversified market.

While I have had a lot of success through long-term dividend-conscious investing there is no denying that others have made money by investing in the technology sector.

By most definitions the vast majority of tech stocks would fit more comfortably in the “growth” basket then under the “value” definition whereas the Canadian dividend kings generally tend to fall in the value investing category. Realistically when talking about Canadian tech stocks there are only a few big companies with established track records – and then an ever-evolving group of long shots.

1) Constellation Software (CSU)

As Canada’s second largest tech stock (after Shopify) Constellation Software has been a powerhouse of tech brands over the last couple of decades. With 32000 employees and a market cap of over $45 billion this isn’t your usual “tech stock on the verge of breaking out” type of story.

Constellation Software is more a story of how a founder-run company has managed to create valuable expertise and synergies across many different geographical and technical markets by making smart acquisitions and then improving efficiency. With returns in the 30% range since 2006 CSU has been a growth investing darling for a long time now.

The software behemoth has six major verticals that serve as a way of organizing the 700+ software brands that operate under their massive umbrella. While CSU does have operations around the world its revenue is principally generated by its transactions in North America and Europe.

While there is no denying that an effective ability to use leverage to find value is a hallmark of many successful tech companies Constellation has adopted a different approach over the years. By relying chiefly on free cash flow to fund their acquisitions they may have grown at a slightly lower clip than some competitors but it also has put them in a much better spot to weather a high-interest rate environment and possibly even scoop up some attractively-priced acquisitions in a tech-stressed environment.

Even during a post-pandemic pullback of the “software eating the world” mentality we see Constellation continue to raise their own high bar with revenues growing nearly 30% year over year and earnings up over 43%! That’s the kind of growth it takes to justify a lofty P/E multiple of 78.

Considering that it is a low-debt company that recently traded at multiples of over 100x some experts think there is still time to get in on CSU’s long-term growth. While they do pay a dividend the current yield is only .24%. It’s tough to have it both ways – if a company is going to go out and aggressively buy future growth opportunities – plus take on relatively small amounts of debt – it’s hard to also pay a substantial dividend.

2) Lightspeed POS (TSX: LSPD)

Up until 2020 Lightspeed was kicking butt. As an all-in-one solution for small- and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) who wanted to collect payment at the Point of Sale (POS) Lightspeed’s organic growth and growth by acquisition attracted a ton of investor attention.

Then the pandemic hit – and most folks figured that a company specializing in person-to-person interactions might be in for tough sledding… only for Lightspeed to prove them dead wrong. As part of the tech-driven bull market during 2021 Lightspeed stock went through the roof.

The company has numerous subsidiaries including Ecwid Inc. Vend ShopKeep iKentoo SA and Kounta. It has a seamless work in with the SaaS platform and sells the POS hardware SMEs need as well. It was founded in 2005 and was founder-ran until 2022. Headquartered in Montreal the company has offices in New York Ottawa Amsterdam and Ghent.

Following a brilliant run up to 2021 the ground underneath Lightspeed started shaking. A company named Spruce Point Capital decided to:

a) Bet that Lightspeed stock would go down (aka: short the stock)

b) Release a bunch of information that accused Lightspeed of presenting false information at numerous points in its development.

Lightspeed immediately responded saying that information released by Spruce Point had many inaccuracies and pointed out the obvious conflict of interest. Obviously this caused many shareholders to grow nervous right around the time when a general tech sell-off was about to occur as we entered 2022.

As a consequence of this sequence of events Ligthspeed stock has dropped more than 80% from its all-time highs. Critics of the company cite the fact that company needs to produce more free cash flow ASAP and claim that they overpaid for acquisitions in order to grow their market share.

That said it doesn’t take a genius to figure out that as people come back to eat at restaurants hit the links and shop in person a company that specializes in point of sale strategies is going to do a lot better! At its most recent earnings call the company stated that unlike other tech companies they were planning to keep up their hiring pace in the next year and were quite confident of both overall sales and the ability to get to cash flow positive in the next 18 months.

With revenues up 50% year over year and a relatively clean balance sheet to soak up any short term losses Lightspeed is a great candidate for being an oversold stock. On the other hand it has to prove that it can convert all that growth into long-term profits before many investors will extend their trust.

3) Open Text (OTEX)

Open Text is another Waterloo-based logistics and information management company. Dealing with businesses of all sizes Open Text offers different ways for companies to optimize their supply chains and increase overall efficiency. It was founded in 1991 has roughly 15000 employees and has been on some dividend-investors radar screen for a while now due to their dividend growth policy.

The name of the game these days in terms of maximizing value from corporate assets is handling data and using it to provide what people want. Companies that can help others do this are in high demand. When you also layer in digital security expertise on top of that cloud-based data experience – you’re looking at a company with very solid growth prospects.

Open Text has been aggressive in growth by acquisition purchasing over 80 companies in the last ten years. Despite the aggressive spend Open Text has a reasonable debt-to-equity ratio of just over one and has a history of solid free cash flow. Dividend Stocks Rock guru Mike Heroux predicts the company will continue to grow its dividend by 12% per year in the short- and medium-term.

Of course as with all things tech the major threat to Open Text is massive American competitors. They are in a hyper-competitive industry and while they have managed to ride the wave so far there is danger in that level of competition.

All that said those large competitors also make Open Text an attractive takeover target. With a P/E ratio of 27 the stock is currently valued much more conservatively than that of its peers and the long-term confidence of the company is showcased by its willingness to pay a nearly 2.5% dividend.

4) Descartes Systems (DSG)

Descartes Systems is a supply chain solutions company based out of the Mecca of tech in Canada – Waterloo Ontario. It is actually a fairly old company (maybe ancient by tech standards) having been founded in 1981.

The company is world-wide with operations across the entire planet and has managed to scale by creating a sustainable advantage in the field of transitioning traditional logistics systems to more modern cloud-based solutions as well as acquiring competitors at reasonable valuations.

Descartes currently has a market cap of $6 billion and has shown solid long-term growth. Its recent quarterly earnings call revealed that revenue was up nearly 18% year over year and earnings were up an even-more-healthy 25%.

Investors clearly keep expecting the company to grow revenues and earnings at this pace as the current P/E ratio of 68 means that you will pay a premium to own a piece of this quality company. Then again this type of ratio is not uncommon for quickly growing tech stocks.

Recently the general tech sell off has hurt Descartes stock momentum but also put a crimp in their business model to some degree. While I’m not sure the current valuation makes enough sense for me to jump in with both feet I am encouraged by Descartes’ long-term stability its positive cash flow (especially important for a tech company in today’s market) and its low debt levels.

5) Shopify (SHOP)

The elephant in the room when it comes to discussing Canadian tech stocks is Shopify (SHOP).

I mean really there is SHOP – and then there’s everyone else.

The software giant was briefly Canada’s largest company by market cap as the tech darling of the pandemic (remember when online shopping was going to become “the only shopping”?) before crashing back to Earth. Here are just a few numbers to try and put this unique company into context.

Share price is down 70% YTD

Even with this low share price it’s still by far the biggest tech stock in Canada with a market cap north of $60 Billion.

Its total return since going public in 2015 is still over 1250%!

Nearly 1.6 million websites ran Shopify last year.

Revenue is up nearly 16% year over year.

Despite higher revenues the company still lost over one billion dollars last quarter.

What a crazy company to try and place a value on! I mean it was briefly cash flow positive but truthfully I don’t think anyone really knows just how much profit this company will produce when it fully matures.

Shopify quickly established a niche for themself as the “friendly alternative to Amazon” when it came to selling stuff online. It has heavily invested in both organic growth and acquisitions and has created a really solid long-term competitive advantage with its creative new ideas and economies of scale.

All of that said at some point investors get tired of “paying for potential” – and I’d say that we’ve pretty much reached that point. As one of the most heavily analyzed companies in the world you can spend all day reading various takes about what this company should be worth and if it is over- or undervalued at the moment.

I think long-term Shopify will continue to succeed as a company and that its business model places it smackdab in the middle of the online retail growth trend. That said as with everything in tech the question is just what is the right price tag for this company that still has so much of its story left to write?

I intend to ignore the noise surrounding the recent stock split and wait to see how well Shopify is able to control costs now that CEO Tobias Lütke has admitted that they need to cut employees and look to get back to profitability sooner rather than later.

6) Kinaxis (KXS)

Kinaxis is another of Canada’s supply chain management software companies. It’s located in Ottawa and was founded back in 1984. Obviously with supply chain pressures being more intense than ever the race for efficiency is going to provide strong demand for companies with solutions.

While Kinaxis’ growth has been excellent (with recent revenues up nearly 35% year on year) the company is just trading at a massive premium right now with a price-to-earnings multiple of over 500! Given that it’s only down about 10% over the last year it has retained value far better than many of its Canadian tech peers.

While it’s reassuring to see that investors have strong faith in the company it does represent a bit of a problem in terms of current value. While the company recent announced strong growth forecasts the execution of these plans would have to be absolutely incredible to justify this current valuation.

That said it’s certainly possible that this strong management team is able to pull it off. Afterall the company just completed its fourth major acquisition since 2020 when it bought the Dutch company MP Objects NV. Kinaxis clients include major corporate behemoths such as Ford Unilever and Merck.

There are many out there who will tell you that Kinaxis is the best bet out of all of the Canadian tech stocks but for me its current valuation is “too rich for my blood” considering the much lower multiples available in similar software companies.

Best Canadian Tech Stock ETFs

If you want instant diversified exposure to the Canadian tech sector the BlackRock iShares S&P/TSX Information Technology Index ETF (XIT) is probably your best bet.

Now given the relatively small number of tech companies in Canada I’d be more inclined to recommend the US or Global markets if you’re looking to “overweight” on the technology sector. There are several different tech stock ETFs in the US but the most applicable one for Canadians would be the QQQ CAD Index ETF(QQC-F).

This ETF is the Canadian version of the QQQ Nasdaq-tracking index in the USA and includes many of the biggest companies in the world today such as Alphabet (Google) Netflix Meta (Facebook) Amazon Microsoft Apple etc.

While there is a layer of withholding tax added to dividend distributions in this time of “US ETF inside of a Canadian ETF” structure these tech stocks don’t offer much on the dividend side of things anyway so it’s not like it’s a big sacrifice.

It’s also worth checking out our Best ETFs in Canada article for more diversified portfolio options.

Final Word on Canadian Tech Stocks

When it comes to valuing and investing in Canadian tech stocks I’m just not the right demographic. I like companies with long-term track records lots of free-cash flow and sustainable durable competitive advantage. Even better if I can find those type of companies at a discount – which is why I’m a fan of the Dogs of the TSX strategy.

With rising interest rates affecting discount tables and low liquidity biting into the “growth at all costs” business models these tech companies pursue I’m just a skeptic until proven otherwise.

Now that said if we’re looking at the tech sector more broadly I’m a big fan of the more mature US companies in the space. It’s just really hard to compare the US tech stocks given their massive scale and competitive moat to our relatively small world of Canadian tech stocks.",,,,,,

These are our thoughts and first impressions of the new compact foldable!

Selfie Camera



After months of heavy speculation and leaks Samsung has officially launched the Galaxy Z Fold4 and the Galaxy Z Flip4. In this article we take an early look at the new compact foldable.

But before we do let's talk about the key specs. It features an inner folding 120Hz FHD+ 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X Infinity Flex display. On the outside is a 1.9-inch Super AMOLED secondary screen. Inside is the newly released 4nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 octa-core processor 8GB LPDDR5 RAM UFS 3.1 storage and a larger 3700mAh battery with 25W fast wired charging.

At the back is a 12MP f/1.8 primary camera and a 12MP f/2.2 123-degree ultra-wide angle camera while on the display is a punch hole that houses the 10MP f/2.4 selfie camera.

In the Philippines the price starts at PHP 58990 for 128GB of storage.

Let's dive into the first impressions.



Build Quality/Design

All four colorways



Like the Galaxy S22 Ultra the Galaxy Z Flip4 is made of Armor Aluminum. It was first introduced with the last year's Galaxy Z Flip3 5G and Z Fold3 5G . Samsung claims that it is lighter and ""stronger"" than other aluminum.





The metal frame between the glass back panel and the glass front panel feels solid. While the glass on the outer side and on the display is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass Victus+. These materials make the phone look premium but make it both slippery to hold and make a fingerprint smudge magnet.





""Improved metal frame"" + Corning Gorilla Glass Victus+





We still recommend wearing a case right away.





The Z Flip4 is IPX8 water resistance rated which means it can survive being submerged 1.5 meters underwater for up to 30 minutes.

Outer screen

On the outer side is the 1.9-inch Super AMOLED secondary screen. Samsung says that they've added more functionality thru software. We'll see.

While on the inner side is the 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X Infinity Flex display with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate and a 2640 x 1080 resolution.

Samsung has tweaked the bezels around the inner display to be slimmer too.

Both screens are bright that produce images with crisp text vibrant color and plenty of detail.

The crease is just marginally better (a bit better) coming from the Z Flip3. The firm also ""improved"" the ultra-thin glass to resist breaking (only time will tell).

Top and bottom



On top of the phone are antenna lines and a microphone port while at the bottom are more antenna lines a speaker grill a USB-C port and more microphones.





Unlike 2022 foldables from other brands Samsung's flip foldable phone is still not gapless...





In between the two halves is the hinge with the Samsung logo. Samsung says that they've tweaked the design of the hinge to be more durable while reducing the gap between both sides when folded.

Left and right

On the left side of the phone are more antenna lines and the SIM tray while on the right side are the Power button and the volume rocker. The power button doubles as the fingerprint scanner. The volume rocker is also made of metal. Both buttons offer satisfying feedback when pressed.

The Galaxy Z Flip4 measures 165.2 x 71.9 x 6.3 mm when unfolded and measures 84.9 x 71.9 x 17.1 mm when folded. It weighs 187 grams which means it is lightweight for a phone made of metal and glass with added components needed for it to fold. Rear cameras

For cameras It features a dual rear-facing module made up of a 12MP f/1.8 primary camera with Dual Pixel AF and OIS and a 12MP f/2.2 123-degree ultra-wide camera with an LED flash while on the punch hole is a 10MP f/2.4.

Once we obtain a unit for review we will share more details about the camera.

So stay tuned for upcoming camera samples and for our full review.

As of the moment

With the Z Fold4



The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip4 is a refinement of last year's Z Flip3. Samsung polished and improved what made the foldable great while tweaking the hardware to be more ergonomic and functional.

It does come with the last Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 and with a larger 3700mAh battery. It even supports the faster 25W SuperFast wired charging.

At first glance apart from the chipset it subtle upgrade over the previous generation.

We will have to see how much better it fares after we've had a unit tested extensively.

Stay tuned until then.

With many drugstores dispensing coronavirus tests and vaccines while filling hundreds of prescriptions each day working as a pharmacist became a sleep-deprived lunch-skipping frenzy — one in which ornery customers did not hesitate to vent their frustrations over the inevitable backups and bottlenecks.

“I was stressed all day long about giving immunizations” said Amanda Poole who left her job as a pharmacist at a CVS in Tuscaloosa Ala. in June. “I’d look at patients and say to them ‘I’d love to fill your prescriptions today but there’s no way I can.’”

Yet pay for pharmacists who typically spend six or seven years after high school working toward their professional degree fell nearly 5 percent last year after adjusting for inflation. Dr. Poole said her pay about $65 per hour did not increase in more than four years — first at an independent pharmacy then at CVS.

For many Americans one of the pandemic’s few bright spots has been wage growth with pay rising rapidly for those near the bottom and those at the top. But a broad swath of workers in between has lagged behind.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vZXNzZXhuZXdzZGFpbHkuY29tL25ld3MvY291bnR5L3Rlbi1zdHVkZW50cy1ncmFkdWF0ZS1mcm9tLWp2cy1wcm9ncmFtLXRvLWJlZ2luLWNhcmVlcnMtaW4tcGhhcm1hY3nSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ten students graduate from JVS program to begin careers in pharmacy,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='essexnewsdaily.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/county/ten-students-graduate-from-jvs-program-to-begin-careers-in-pharmacy (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159B92BE7A0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vZXNzZXhuZXdzZGFpbHkuY29tL25ld3MvY291bnR5L3Rlbi1zdHVkZW50cy1ncmFkdWF0ZS1mcm9tLWp2cy1wcm9ncmFtLXRvLWJlZ2luLWNhcmVlcnMtaW4tcGhhcm1hY3nSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9jYi1kZXJlay1zdGluZ2xleS1naXZlcy10YW50YWxpemluZy0xNTIyMDA1NDYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CB Derek Stingley gives tantalizing glimpse in Texans debut,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9jYi1kZXJlay1zdGluZ2xleS1naXZlcy10YW50YWxpemluZy0xNTIyMDA1NDYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159B92BE2C0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9jYi1kZXJlay1zdGluZ2xleS1naXZlcy10YW50YWxpemluZy0xNTIyMDA1NDYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaWNhZ290cmlidW5lLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzIxL3doeS1pcy1pdC1zby1oYXJkLXRvLWZpbmQtdGhlcmFwaXN0cy13aG8tdGFrZS1pbnN1cmFuY2UtaW4taWxsaW5vaXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why is it so hard to find therapists who take insurance in Illinois?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.chicagotribune.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2022/08/21/why-is-it-so-hard-to-find-therapists-who-take-insurance-in-illinois/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159B92BEAA0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaWNhZ290cmlidW5lLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzIxL3doeS1pcy1pdC1zby1oYXJkLXRvLWZpbmQtdGhlcmFwaXN0cy13aG8tdGFrZS1pbnN1cmFuY2UtaW4taWxsaW5vaXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

The answer is $170000. That's how much you'd have now if you'd invested $10000 in Deere (DE 0.88%) 20 years ago. It's a super return for a large-cap company as elephants aren't supposed to be able to gallop. Moreover what's remarkable about Deere's stock performance is its tripling over the last five years. The company has been doing something right because its returns dwarf those of the S&P 500 and its peers like AGCO and CNH Industrial. Here's a look at what makes the agricultural machinery company so unique.

Why Deere's stock has outperformed

There are a few key reasons why Deere has outperformed in recent years:

After half a decade in the doldrums the prices of key crop commodities like soybeans corn and wheat have increased significantly over the last few years (see chart below).

The company's leadership in smart farming solutions has added a significant amount of value to its equipment and kept farmers loyal to Deere's equipment.

Management's acquisition policy has been excellent in building its precision agriculture (smart farming) business and diversifying its end markets by acquiring a major road construction equipment maker Wirtgen in 2017.

As noted above crop commodity prices have risen to historical highs recently which is excellent news for crop farmers. It's also great news for Deere because it encourages farmers to replace aging equipment. It's also timely because it coincides with a period when Deere is aggressively rolling out its precision agriculture solutions -- more on that in a moment.

Great acquisition history

Deere is best known for its large and small agriculture equipment but it also has a construction and forestry segment which contributes handily to profitability. For example the segment contributed $1.5 billion to operating profit in 2021 compared to $2 billion for small ag and turf and $3.3 billion for production and precision ag.

In addition the $5.2 billion acquisition of Wirtgen bolstered Deere's position in road construction machinery and helped diversify its income stream. That's a major plus for investors and the company because it ensures a level of earnings and cash flow. That's important because Deere will need cash to invest in its business even when its core agriculture machinery business is experiencing weak conditions.

Precision agriculture

Deere's acquisition strategy is an instrumental part of its precision ag strategy. Precision ag solutions use real-time data gathered from internet-enabled devices to help farmers make the right decisions in an industry fraught with uncertainty. For example preparing the soil planting nurturing and harvesting are critical decisions that hugely affect crop yield.

Deere's technology solutions are deeply embedded in its hardware. For example it has the technology to control spraying and monitor and control fertilizer application and solutions that use data to guide planting spraying and harvesting. It's a set of solutions Deere built up through organic investment and acquisitions such as the 2017 acquisition of Blue River Technology  creators of ""see and spray"" technology to spray herbicide precisely.

Harvest Profit a provider of farm profitability software was bought in 2020 and Bear Flag Robotics was purchased in 2021. The latter is a developer of autonomous driving technology that can be retrofitted to existing tractors.

Looking ahead

Deere's leadership in precision ag has encouraged peers to follow in its steps and make acquisitions in the space. It combines the right technology at the right time (as crop prices recovered) and Deere is reaping the rewards. Whether $10000 invested in Deere now will lead you to $170000 in 20 years is debatable. However no one will argue that Deere isn't the market leader in an industry (precision ag) that is only getting started in improving global crop yields. As such investors can look forward to more earnings growth in the future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtYXJpbGxvLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDgvMjEvanViaWxlZS1vZi10cmFjdG9ycy1mZXN0aXZhbC1yYWlzZXMtbW9uZXktZm9yLWhlcmVmb3JkLW11c2V1bS82NTQxMjA0OTAwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jubilee of Tractors Festival raises money for Hereford museum,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.amarillo.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /story/news/2022/08/21/jubilee-of-tractors-festival-raises-money-for-hereford-museum/65412049007/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159B91272B0>, 'Connection to www.amarillo.com timed out.

Early warning of low glucose helps control diabetes.

Suppliers of a device which they say alerts people with diabetes to low glucose levels are working toward government funding for subsidised access and wider use.

The device – Dexcom G6 Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) – sends alerts to a smartphone every five minutes 24/7 from a small sensor inserted just under the skin on the stomach or upper arm.

Although the CGM is available to Australians with Type 1 diabetes through a subsidy approved by the government there last month it is not funded in New Zealand where it has been on the market since 2020.

Now the company behind the device New Zealand Medical and Scientific Ltd (NZMS Diabetes) is working with Pharmac (the New Zealand government agency which decides which medicines and related products are subsidised) to change that.

NZMS Diabetes' New Zealand Country Manager Kirstin Brown says while they are happy for Australians living with Type 1 diabetes the company wants to see the same benefits for Kiwis who live with the all-encompassing condition.

Diabetes can be potentially life-threatening and Brown says the device eliminates the need for people to prick their fingers* to take multiple blood samples every day reducing the burden of managing their condition.

""It represents a new standard of care by using the latest technology for monitoring"" she says. ""This gives people peace of mind to know that if their readings are getting too high or too low they have time to act.""

The CGM wirelessly transmits glucose readings every five minutes to a compatible smart device** or receiver and not only provides real-time glucose readings but can send alerts when the levels are too high or drop too low. The sensor is changed every 10 days.

""Many individuals living with diabetes have a constant worry and fear of requiring hospitalisation by falling into a state of hypoglycaemia if their glucose levels drop too much. Up until now the only way they can measure it is by doing a blood sugar test many times a day a process that involves pricking the finger for a blood sample.

""The CGM by contrast provides continuous data tracks where the glucose is heading – whether high or low – and gives prompts so people can make more informed decisions about their diabetes care"" Brown says. ""Sometimes glucose levels fall quickly and the CGM has an 'Urgent Low Soon' alert which provides a 20-minute advance warning.""

She believes it is vital it becomes as widely available in the community as soon as possible. Up to 250000 New Zealanders have diabetes. About 20000 have Type 1 a form of the illness in which the body stops producing insulin and which is mostly diagnosed in children and CGM is also available for Type 2 diabetes.

Glucose readings can also be shared remotely through a Follow app*** a feature Brown says benefits lifestyle choices which can be especially significant for children. When a child is not at home people like their parents and grandparents can receive readings on their phones with up to 10 followers receiving glucose data.

""It means kids can have sleepovers or go on school camps without their parents wondering what their glucose levels might be"" she says. ""One teenage boy who uses the device loves both the technology and the freedom it gives him; he's very active in sports and CGM means he can worry less but live more.""

The CGM can be purchased direct from NZMS Diabetes: ""People don't need a script but we do recommend they talk to their doctor or medical advisor before using it if they want.""

Brown says it can also be trialled so people can use it and see how it works for them by purchasing a 90-day pack or through a year's subscription. NZMS Diabetes also has a 24/7 technical support line people can call if they have any questions or concerns.

People tend to shop at Dollar General for a handful of reasons. A good percentage of the items in-store are either inexpensive or discounted making the chain accessible to shoppers who are careful with their money and are sensitive about price points. And because of the way Dollar General's business is built Dollar General could well be the only retail option in town as most of their stores are built in what are described as ""food deserts"" aka areas where residents have limited access to grocery stores or markets.

But as it turns out food deserts are lacking in healthcare opportunities too. So in August of 2021 Dollar General's then-CEO Todd Vasos said the company would be looking to expand its offerings into a completely new field. During that particular earnings call Vasos said (via NBC) ""What we're going to be squarely focused on ... are those services that rural America today especially doesn't have access to. We talk a lot about grocery deserts or food deserts. There's as equal health care deserts out there across the U.S. and we're in all of these communities.""

Despite recent social media backlash for upping their prices to $1.25 after a 35-year reign as one of the only true dollar stores (per CNN) Dollar Tree is still a premiere destination for discounted goods. Offering everything from best-selling novels and cat toys to candles and shampoo Dollar Tree is a frugal oasis with a buffet of miscellaneous merchandise for deal finders and couponers.

As inflation worsens America's food crisis even top earners are turning to food banks and discount grocers to get their meals at an affordable rate (per Fox Business). For the millions of families and individuals currently strapped for cash Dollar Tree is a great alternative to overpriced supermarkets. The discount variety store even offers name brand items like Nature Valley protein bars Old Bay hot sauce and Olive Garden's signature Italian dressing. While Eating Well lists items like Green Giant sliced carrots and Honey Nut Cheerios as some of Dollar Tree's healthier items there are also plenty of items in the food section that skimp on quality ingredients in exchange for that revered $1.25 price tag.

YouTube creator Sensational Finds dedicates her channel to sharing discount shopping tips. But in her recent YouTube video she adds Dollar Tree's imitation vanilla extract to her ""don't buy"" list. According to Healthline vanilla extract is made by soaking vanilla beans in a mixture of water and ethyl alcohol while Dollar Tree's imitation extract is loaded with sugar artificial coloring and flavor and preservatives.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzIxL3ZpZGVvLXNob3dzLW55Yy1kb2xsYXItc3RvcmUtc2hvcGxpZnRlcnMtcHV0dGluZy13b3JrZXItaW4tY2hva2Vob2xkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Video shows NYC dollar-store shoplifters putting worker in chokehold: cops,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzIxL3ZpZGVvLXNob3dzLW55Yy1kb2xsYXItc3RvcmUtc2hvcGxpZnRlcnMtcHV0dGluZy13b3JrZXItaW4tY2hva2Vob2xkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159B8C80940>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzIxL3ZpZGVvLXNob3dzLW55Yy1kb2xsYXItc3RvcmUtc2hvcGxpZnRlcnMtcHV0dGluZy13b3JrZXItaW4tY2hva2Vob2xkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3lvcmsvbmV3cy9jYXVnaHQtb24tdmlkZW8tbWFuLXdvbWFuLXJvYi1icm9ueC1mYW1pbHktZG9sbGFyLXN0b3JlLWVtcGxveWVlLXB1dC1pbi1jaG9rZWhvbGQv0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL25ld3lvcmsvbmV3cy9jYXVnaHQtb24tdmlkZW8tbWFuLXdvbWFuLXJvYi1icm9ueC1mYW1pbHktZG9sbGFyLXN0b3JlLWVtcGxveWVlLXB1dC1pbi1jaG9rZWhvbGQv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Police: Man woman rob Bronx Family Dollar store employee put in chokehold,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.cbsnews.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /newyork/news/caught-on-video-man-woman-rob-bronx-family-dollar-store-employee-put-in-chokehold/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159B8C82E30>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3lvcmsvbmV3cy9jYXVnaHQtb24tdmlkZW8tbWFuLXdvbWFuLXJvYi1icm9ueC1mYW1pbHktZG9sbGFyLXN0b3JlLWVtcGxveWVlLXB1dC1pbi1jaG9rZWhvbGQv0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL25ld3lvcmsvbmV3cy9jYXVnaHQtb24tdmlkZW8tbWFuLXdvbWFuLXJvYi1icm9ueC1mYW1pbHktZG9sbGFyLXN0b3JlLWVtcGxveWVlLXB1dC1pbi1jaG9rZWhvbGQv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueWRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8yMS92aWRlby1zaG9wbGlmdGVycy1iZWF0LWNob2tlLWd1dHN5LWJyb254LWZhbWlseS1kb2xsYXItc3RvcmUtd29ya2VyLXdoZW4taS1zZWUtdGhlZnQtaS1mZWVsLXNvLWJhZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,VIDEO: Shoplifters beat choke gutsy Bronx Family Dollar store worker: 'When I see theft I feel so bad',"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueWRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8yMS92aWRlby1zaG9wbGlmdGVycy1iZWF0LWNob2tlLWd1dHN5LWJyb254LWZhbWlseS1kb2xsYXItc3RvcmUtd29ya2VyLXdoZW4taS1zZWUtdGhlZnQtaS1mZWVsLXNvLWJhZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159B8C814E0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueWRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8yMS92aWRlby1zaG9wbGlmdGVycy1iZWF0LWNob2tlLWd1dHN5LWJyb254LWZhbWlseS1kb2xsYXItc3RvcmUtd29ya2VyLXdoZW4taS1zZWUtdGhlZnQtaS1mZWVsLXNvLWJhZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

In the 1960s engineers Hans Werner Aufrecht and Erhard Melcher received some terrible news. Daimler-Benz had decided to end all motorsport activities — tough luck for a duo working in the engine development department where they’d been wrenching on a new racing engine for the 300 SE. Rather than kill the project the engineers took the power plant to Aufrecht’s basement in Großaspach Germany and continued development after hours.

In 1965 the engine was ready to go racing. With racing driver Manfred Schiek behind the wheel they entered that year’s German Touring Car Championship. And the engine didn’t just race — it won 10 times proving to Aufrecht and Melcher that they were onto something big. Aufrecht decided he was ready to branch out and enlisted Melcher to continue their racing pursuits as an independent brand. In 1967 AMG was born.

AMG which stands for Aufrecht Melcher and Großaspach charged out of the gates with an ambitious first project. The engineers purchased a used Mercedes-Benz 300 SEL 6.3 and began to prepare it for entry in one of the toughest races of the time the 24 Hours of Spa. The crown jewel was the car’s engine punched out to 6.8 liters and delivering 428 horsepower. In 1971 sans the support of Mercedes-Benz their team of 12 took to the track with the very first AMG. Onlookers mocked it and rightfully so. The 300 SEL was a big heavy luxury sedan not a purebred racer. They dubbed it “Red Pig.”

The Red Pig didn’t take long to transform mockery into amazement. Despite starting fourth on the grid the land yacht turned speedboat led the race by the end of the first lap. It dominated all of its competitors winning first in class and second overall. According to Aufrecht they would’ve won overall if the regulators hadn’t limited its fuel tank to a measly 120 liters. Nonetheless AMG had left a mark and throughout the 1970s business exploded. So much so that the tuning firm relocated to Affalterbach where it lives today.

Fast-forward to 1986 — AMG unveiled its most significant road car dubbed the AMG Hammer on account of the 5.0-liter V8 that lived under its hood. This engine was unique because it featured new four-valve-per-cylinder technology which had been developed by Melcher two years prior. It was the first time anyone had used this configuration in a Mercedes-Benz and it boosted power tremendously.

By 1993 Mercedes-Benz wanted a piece of the performance pie. The carmaker signed a contract with the tuning firm allowing Mercedes-Benz to sell AMG- branded vehicles through its vast dealership network. The first was the Mercedes-Benz AMG C 36 released that year and marking the start of a fruitful partnership. Within four years Mercedes-Benz commissioned AMG to build the marque’s first race car — from scratch; 128 days after AMG completed its initial sketch the Mercedes- Benz CLK GTR entered to race in the FIA GT Championship series.

At the turn of the century Mercedes-Benz acquired a controlling stake in AMG renaming it Mercedes-AMG GmbH. Following this move Mercedes-AMG furthered its development of significant components for road vehicles. This included bespoke engines transmissions and entire cars from the ground up. In 2005 Aufrecht then 67 sold his remaining shares giving Mercedes-Benz complete control over its performance subdivision.

Throughout the 2010s Mercedes-AMG ramped up its engineering might while producing more in-house vehicles than ever before starting with the SLS AMG. The performance carmaker now manufactures three in-house vehicles: the AMG GT SL Roadster and GT 4-Door Coupé. The company’s most ambitious project yet — the Mercedes-AMG One — is currently underway.

From the back and forth banter between Jennifer and her cousin Bruce to the fighting between the two and the obvious deep admiration and respect they both have for each other it is clear that Bruce trusted Jennifer to curb her Hulk rage and hone her skills.

Throughout the episode Bruce attempts to train his cousin to control her powers and better dictate when they appear an ability which Jennifer naturally possessed but perfected. Although Jennifer comes to terms with her new powers by the end of the episode she’s initially reluctant to have them and incredibly annoyed.

Bruce says “Listen I know you didn’t ask for this but whether you like it or not you’re now a superhero. And who’s gonna protect the world if it isn’t people like us?” To which Jennifer Walters says “Are you quoting a comic book right now?” Bruce basically says “Yeah.” Fans of the MCU are wanting to know which comic book Bruce pulls this legendary quote from.

After researching different comics it does not appear that this is a direct quote from any specific comic book even though Bruce claims it to be. Regardless this still made viewers think of Ben Parker’s famous quote “With great power comes great responsibility” as Peter Parker was having trouble coming to terms with his new powers even though his uncle was not aware of them. Hearing this helped mold and shape Peter into the hero that MCU fans have all come to know and love.

Jennifer is also having issues with accepting her new fate as She-Hulk when her cousin tells her this and it is in that time that Jennifer appears to accept her role and come to terms with the heroine that was thrust upon her. She works long and hard to train herself and her powers in the first episode and even though she and Bruce have their disagreements Jennifer proves to Bruce that she appreciates the wisdom that he shares with her. MCU fans can stream She-Hulk: Attorney at Law now on Disney Plus.

SELLING unwanted items from around the house could easily make you more than £1000 one eBay expert has revealed.

Clare Seal is behind Instagram account My Frugal Year where she has documented got her 88000 followers how she paid off a massive £27000 in debt.

2 Clare Seal reveals her top tips for selling your stuff on eBay

Now she shares her top tips for reducing your outgoings including selling all your unwanted belongings on second hand sites such as eBbay.

She said: ""Putting in the effort to sell what you no longer use is a great way to make a bit of extra cash.

""Sometimes it can be the most surprising things too - I listed empty fancy soap bottles from Aesop and they sold for £10!""

Millions of households are looking for easy ways to make some extra cash in the cost of living crisis.

It's a good way to cope with spiralling energy bills soaring petrol prices and rising costs at the supermarket.

And research by eBay found that the average person has more than £1100 worth of unwanted stuff lying around the house.

Old tech is some of the most lucrative to sell on - an unused laptop could get you £290 and a smartphone £153.

If you're clearing out the kids' bedrooms keep an eye out. An old pushchair or pram could earn you £40 and you could expect to pocket around £11 from old baby books.

If you've ever tried a new hobby only to quickly give it up - at least try and make some money back. Musical instruments could earn you £137 and DJ equipment could fetch £68.

Elsewhere around the house eBay estimates that the average seller can make £36 from clothes and shoes they no longer use £22 from cookware and even £40 from photo frames.

Be sure to check the fees before you list on any site - eBay lets you list up to 1000 items a month for free but will take a cut of the sale price.

Here are Clare's top tips for making the most of your eBay listing:

Use the best key words

Ebay can be a real treasure trove of the most unexpected items - but you need to use the best key words to give you goodies the best chance of being discovered.

When you search for an item on eBay the results are filtered based on the title that the seller has given to their listing.

That means stuffing your listing title with lots of searchable terms which describe your item is crucial if you want buyers to find you.

Clare said: ""Even for things that you don't think will be available second hand items that are niche or specific - it's always worth checking eBay.""

Buyers can set up a saved search to help them keep an eye out for any specific items they're waiting to come up for sale.

Often people find it's worth the wait because it's cheaper than buying through a traditional retailer.

Pick the right category

When you're creating a listing for sale on eBay you'll need to choose a category to put it in.

Selecting the most appropriate category means a higher chance of the right buyers discovering your listing.

So parents selling children's clothes - select ""children's fashion"" not just ""fashion"".

Clare said knowing that old items are going to buyer who will appreciate them can make it easier to sell things on that have nostalgic value.

Clare said; ""There are something things I have been sad to sell - definitely some of my children's clothes.

""We had a couple of lovely organic items that were in really good conditions and I was sad to them them go but happy that another baby would get to wear them.""

Pictures are important

Ebay shoppers want to see what they're buying so if you want to maximise your sale price you need to include some decent pictures.

Listings without photos attached can make people nervous - no matter how good the description is.

Clare said: ""I recommended hanging clothing if you're going to sell it rather than folding it or laying it on the floor.""

Clare suggests using good lighting and a plain background. Be honest about any scratches or wear and tear on an item too she added.

""Take photos from lots of different angles and include close-ups if there is any special detail.""

Be detailed with your description

Once a buyer is interested you need to win them over with a fabulous description.

Be clear about the condition of the product or you'll risk negative feedback.

If you're selling clothes describe the fit of the item or the feel of the material.

Clare said: ""One of my best sales was a gold dress from & Other Stories which I actually bought on eBay in the first place.

""It had a surge in popularity and was out of stock everywhere so when I resold it it go to about £70.""

Timing can be important too Clare said: ""I've found that listing an auction to finish on a Sunday evening often results in lots of last-minute bidding activity.""

Be realistic on the price

Don't just pluck a number out of thin air when you're deciding on an asking price - do some research.

Search for similar items to see how much they've achieved - searching by ""completed listings"" will give you the sold price.

Clare said you should ask yourself: what would I pay for this item? But even then you might end up being pleasantly surprised on some listings.

Clare said: ""I've been surprised by how much some of my items have sold for.

""The biggest surprise was the box from my Dyson Air Wrap. I prefer to just put mine in a drawer so I popped the leather case on eBay and got £30.""

Elsewhere on eBay one coin collector sold a Kew Gardens 50p for £210.

And one seller revealed how he made £1500 by reselling items from Poundland.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vbmoxMDE1LmNvbS95b3VyLWR1c3QtY29sbGVjdGluZy12aHMtdGFwZXMtY291bGQtYnJpbmctaW4tc29tZS1iaWctY2FzaC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,VHS tapes took up storage now can in bring big money,"I remember hearing about and actually participating in getting rid of a lot of clutter during the pandemic. With many places closed and social gatherings postponed it was a great time to look around and throw out stuff that I haven’t used in years.

I wish I would have known then what I know now. Who new there may be money for your old VHS tapes. You can go on demand and get any movie you desire immediately in the comfort of your own home. VHS tapes and machines have been obsolete for years and that’s why they are worth money! The most famous video store in the world Blockbuster closed its doors in 2014 and by 2019 there is only 1 Blockbuster store in the world located in Bend Oregon. So with all that information I tossed my VHS tapes.

Here in New Jersey last December someone paid $57000 for a Star Wars VHS tape!

If you have a classic VHS movie in an unopened box that tape that you paid $20 for in 1980 is now worth $10000! From Rocky to Indiana Jones to Star Wars Jaws and Top Gun the original movies in unopened boxes are worth thousands of dollars. I got duplicates of some of the big movies still in the original box with cellophane wrap that were gifts and I threw them out.

Old VCR tapes someone left along the side of the road. No interesting content. (Craig Allen photo). Old VCR tapes someone left along the side of the road. No interesting content. (Craig Allen photo). loading...

Some experts say that the VHS collectors will spend big money on rare collections or box sets and some big titles are being sold on E-Bay for big money.

So go through the VHS tapes in your basement and attic and if you have a rare VHS tape in an unopened box or a VHS machine that was working when you stored it then you may be able to make a few dollars to pay your cable bill for watching all those movies on demand. Good Luck!

It started as a two-board solution then he added a display module. Instead of layering the boards vertically à la a PC/104 stack [Scott] decided to build them flat. His first backplane was triangular but he opted for a square to accommodate one more expansion board in the future. The assembled contraption resembles a clover hence the name Clover Computer.

The Z8000 was Zilog’s first 16-bit microprocessor introduced in 1979. It was not hugely popular for a variety of reasons (the Z8000 Wikipedia article has some interesting details). The Z8000 was eclipsed in the marketplace by Intel’s 8088 and Motorola’s 32-bit 68000. One interesting point is that the Z8000 did not use microcode and as a result its transistor count was significantly less than its contemporaries. The Z8000 was used in some military applications and despite its limited commercial success it continued to be available from Zilog and licensed second sources up until 2012.

[Scott]’s design splits the system into a CPU board a memory and serial board and a display board. Along the way he learns 1980’s era tricks from the Olivetti M20 one of the few computer systems designed around the Z8000. He also manages to find a recent Z8000 implementation of CP/M by GitHub user [4sun5bu] which [Scott] forked and adapted to his project (see project repo here). He succeeds in getting everything working and ports a monitor Tiny Basic and Zork.

Check out his project write-up introductory link and see it in action in the video below the break. Did you ever use or encounter the Z8000?

Read our ethics policy

Article Hero Image

A former Apple Store employee who used the name ""Sam Sung"" has put an old business card and employee t-shirt up for auction in the name of charity.

The auction listed on eBay as an ""Apple Sam Sung business card"" consists of a framed employee T-shirt and lanyard along with a business card. While not normally notable the lot is unusual due to the name printed on the business card: ""Sam Sung.""

Now known as Sam Struan the employee was genuinely called Sam Sung during his time as a Specialist at the Buchanan Street store in Glasgow Scotland between 2010 and 2012. He later moved to Vancouver and worked at the Pacific Center Apple Store in 2012 reports iPhone in Canada before his business card gained some notoriety due to the close competition between Apple and its South Korean rival.

After leaving Apple's retail arm in 2013 the employee auctioned off the business card using the Sung surname raising over $2500 for Children's Wish BC & Yukon.

Since leaving Apple Struan now works as a career coach.

Earlier in 2022 a family member found another business card created during Struan's time at the Buchanan Street store which brought up the idea of a second charity auction.

Rather than just the business card Struan's lot has been dressed up considerably with the shirt lanyard and business card mounted in a frame and behind glass. Struan also signed the glass ""just for fun.""

Struan adds ""I hope this card goes to a fellow Apple enthusiast who also wants to contribute to a great cause."""

Developed by Electronic Arts Origin is a digital distribution platform from where you can purchase video games and play them on your PC. The platform has a dedicated software client for PC from where you can download your favorite games. But many users have reported that the game downloads automatically stop on Origin. So if you are also having a hard time downloading your favorite video game continue with this troubleshooting guide to fix the problem.

Origin download keeps stopping and getting stuck

If Downloads keep stopping or pausing and won’t finish on Origin on Windows 11/10 PC then you can try the following suggestions:

Try Downloading the Game Again Provide Administrative Privileges to Origin Check Origin Server Status Change Origin Compatibility Mode Allow the Origin Client through Windows Firewall Uninstall the 3rd Party Antivirus Program Clear the Temp Folder Turn Off Origin Client Service Perform SFC Scan

Now let’s check out all these solutions in detail.

1] Try Downloading the Game Again

Before getting into the technical workarounds the very first thing that you should do is to try redownloading the game. It can be a temporary error which is continuously stopping the download. So delete the ongoing downloading process and redownload the game. If this solves the problem you are good to go. But in case the problem continues check out the below technical solutions.

2] Provide Administrative Privileges to Origin

Although it will run even without administrative rights but you will always be prone to different issues. Therefore make sure you have granted all the administrative rights to origin. To do so follow the below steps.

Right-click on the Origin shortcut icon and choose the Properties option. Click on the Compatibility tab. In the following window checkmark the Run this program as an administrator option. Click on Apply > OK.

Launch the Origin client and try to download any game. Check if the problem is fixed or not.

3] Check Origin Server Status

Like any other application Origin servers can go down any time due to some technical difficulties. If that’s the case it’s no surprise you are having a hard time downloading games on Origin. The only good thing is that you are not only the one facing the problem. You can check the Origin server status by visiting any of the server statuses checking websites. Additionally you can visit Origin social sites like Twitter and check if there’s an ongoing issue with the platform.

Unfortunately if the servers are down you can’t do anything other than wait until the developers resolve the issue.

4] Change Origin Compatibility Mode

The next thing you can try to fix the downloading issue of Origin is to run the client in compatibility mode. However this process is only effective if you are encountering a problem with Windows 11. Here are the steps you need to follow.

But at the same time if any application is restricted under Firewall settings it will provide different errors. So here’s how you can allow the Origin Client through Windows Firewall settings.

Click ‘Start’ and type ‘Firewall’ in the search field and then click “Allow an app or feature through Windows Firewall’ from the search results. On the next screen click Change Settings On the list of programs that appears tick/check both ‘Private’ and ‘Public’ options for the Origin Client.

Now restart the Origin client and check if the problem is fixed or not.

6] Uninstall the 3rd Party Antivirus Program

Many third-party antivirus programs can block the smooth functioning of different application including Origin. Although it’s not important to have a dedicated antivirus program on Windows 11 still if you have any it can be the main reason you are facing problems with the origin downloads. So disable the antivirus program while downloading games from Origin and check if the problem is fixed or not. If not try the next solution.

7] Clear the Temp Folder

Temporary files are created by both operating systems and different applications including Origin. You can delete such files in order to free up large space and solve different issues revolving around your system. So here are the steps you need to follow.

Press the Windows + I shortcut key to open the Settings menu. Navigate to System > Storage. Click on Temporary files. Checkmark all the boxes and tap the Remove files option.

In a letter to attorney Lauren Varnado — who was in the courtroom when Hummel allegedly pulled out his firearm and has publicly stated that she felt intimidated by Hummel’s actions — Haught outlined what he believed he saw in courtroom video of the interaction and provided his reasoning as to why criminal charges would not be filed.

“What I saw on the videotape was Judge Hummel displaying his firearm for a few seconds” Haught wrote to Varnado. “It did not appear to me that he pointed his firearm at you or threatened you with the same during that time.

“I did not see or hear him threaten you” Haught added in another correspondence with Varnado “nor did I see him point a firearm at you.”

Haught wrote that if Varnado thought Hummel had committed a crime to let him know immediately so he could appoint a special prosecutor.

“As Judge Hummel is a Circuit Court Judge for Wetzel County and I am an officer of his court and routinely appear before him I do not feel it is appropriate for me to investigate or make prosecutorial decisions regarding this matter.”

Haught also said in the letter that neither he nor local law enforcement had received a complaint regarding the alleged incident nor had he heard from her about his offer to refer the matter to a special prosecuting attorney.

As of Friday morning Haught said he had not received a response from Varnado. When asked why she did not file a complaint against Hummel with the prosecutor’s office Varnado declined to comment. She said previously that she contacted the FBI about the situation and she was contacted by the West Virginia Judicial Investigation Commission regarding Hummel.

Neither Hummel nor his attorney Robert Fitzsimmons could be reached Friday for comment.

Hummel was assigned to oversee a natural gas lease royalty case in Wetzel County. Varnado was representing EQT an oil and gas company in the case regarding royalty payment disputes.

In comments to the Daily Beast in July Hummel denied brandishing a weapon in the courtroom saying he did have a weapon but it never left its holster and that he did show a foil packet of blood coagulant from a first aid kit.

When reached for comment Friday Haught provided the following response:

“Lawyers are restricted under the Rules of Professional Responsibility from making public statements or releasing information that they reasonably believe may be reported in the media and have a prejudicial effect on an investigation or adjudication.

“They are also prohibited from any conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice. A violation of that Rule can result in discipline. Prosecutors are also subject to those Rules. Lawyers are also prohibited from making false or reckless statements that may impugn the integrity of Judges and other legal officials.

“I am strictly following the Rules of Professional Responsibility in the handling of this matter as I do in every matter. It is never in the interest of alleged victims the accused or the administration of justice for lawyers to litigate cases in the media.

“That is what courts are designed to do. Since she has provided the media with my letters I believe I can confirm that as of this morning the last time I checked Ms. Varnado has never made a complaint with local law enforcement or my office or responded in any way to my inquiry regarding her allegations and the appointment of a special prosecutor.

“Almost all of the information that I have regarding Ms. Varnado’s claims is from secondary sources in the media. Due diligence requires prosecutors and law enforcement to seek some confirmation of media reports before taking action. That was the purpose of my letters. “Nevertheless It appears from your inquiry that she continues to provide statements and release information to media outlets. Because in my judgement Ms. Varnado’s allegations may still be subject to some investigation or adjudication I am not going to release any information that may jeopardize prejudice or impact the same.

“That would violate the Rules of Professional Responsibility. I refer you to Rules 3.6 3.8 8.2 and 8.4 of the Rules of Professional Responsibility. These rules require all lawyers to act with integrity to maintain the fair and independent administration of justice.

“I strictly follow them in every case. From the time I became aware of her statements as reported in the media my Office has cooperated with all authorities involved in this matter consistent with the Rules of Professional Responsibility and my duties to all parties and the State of West Virginia as Prosecuting Attorney.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

By Dolores Quintana

Equity Residential faces another lawsuit this time it is a class action lawsuit alleging invasion of privacy filed in Los Angeles Superior Court that alleges that the trust company insisted on running consumer reports rather than just credit checks on their prospective renters that was filed on August 10.

California law dictates that any landlord that wants to run an investigative consumer report on a prospective renter must follow must disclose this information to the renter properly and inform them of the searches of their lives that are being conducted and give the renters access to the results of the search.

Equity Residential is part of Sam Zell’s Chicago-based company REIT which has faced many other legal woes.

The lawsuit states as quoted by The Real Deal that the company “did not want the tenants or prospective tenants to know about or have access to any confidential consumer reports about them but wanted to manage and run the property free of any restrictions questions or inquiries by tenants.” and alleges that Equity responsible for the management of thousands of rentals in the Southern California area deliberately commissioned and with intent hid these intrusive checks from their potential tenants.

None of the defendants are named in the suit which allegedly includes some employees of Equity Residential.

Prospective tenants who applied to two Equity managed and owned properties in Hollywood and Marina del Rey are the plaintiffs. Six of those plaintiffs applied to the Breakwater Apartments in MDR and two applied to Vantage Hollywood Apartments according to The Real Deal and the lawsuit. The lawsuit alleges that Equity Residential was “willful and grossly negligent” and asks for $10000 for each of the investigative consumer reports that were run on the prospective tenants punitive and other damages. The suit also requires that Equity change its policies regarding consumer reports to follow California law.

The suit alleges also that Equity Residential ordered investigative consumer reports on all of its prospective tenants and that the reports as quoted by The Real Deal “often contain errors or misinformation that is highly destructive of an individual’s reputation” which constituted a corporate invasion of privacy of the tenants who applied for apartments in the last two years. The applications did contain a release that would permit Equity “to get private and personal information from third parties.” in violation of the law and would also screen prospective tenants for evictions and do background checks on them that often contained information like credit checks and that would access a prospective tenant’s employability.

The suit goes on to state as quoted by The Real Deal “Without disclosure … [the prospective tenants] would not be able to read the reports and demand that errors be corrected and [the prospective tenants] would not even know if such reports were being used against him or her”

Another lawsuit pending against Equity Residental and their leasing practices is another class action lawsuit about the firm’s policies on late fees. A lawsuit from earlier this year alleged that Equity was chargings prospective tenants five times the rate for background checks and also made allegations about investigative consumer reports which stated that Equity Residential did not give prospective tenants the legally required access to the results of these reports.

In Washington D.C. Equity Residential was ordered by the court to pay almost $2 million in restitution in a lawsuit over illegal and deceptive rental price increases.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvamVubmlmZXJjYXN0ZW5zb24vMjAyMi8wOC8yMC9leHBlcnQtc3RyYXRlZ2llcy10by1hZGFwdC10by1jb25zdHJ1Y3Rpb24tbGFib3Itc2hvcnRhZ2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Expert Strategies To Adapt To Construction Labor Shortage,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennifercastenson/2022/08/20/expert-strategies-to-adapt-to-construction-labor-shortage/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvamVubmlmZXJjYXN0ZW5zb24vMjAyMi8wOC8yMC9leHBlcnQtc3RyYXRlZ2llcy10by1hZGFwdC10by1jb25zdHJ1Y3Rpb24tbGFib3Itc2hvcnRhZ2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndzYXYuY29tL25ld3MvaGFiaXRhdC1mb3ItaHVtYW5pdHktaG9zdHMtaGFiaXRhdC1ob21lLWRlZGljYXRpb24tY2VyZW1vbnkv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3Nhdi5jb20vbmV3cy9oYWJpdGF0LWZvci1odW1hbml0eS1ob3N0cy1oYWJpdGF0LWhvbWUtZGVkaWNhdGlvbi1jZXJlbW9ueS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Habitat for Humanity hosts Habitat Home Dedication ceremony,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.wsav.com/news/habitat-for-humanity-hosts-habitat-home-dedication-ceremony/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndzYXYuY29tL25ld3MvaGFiaXRhdC1mb3ItaHVtYW5pdHktaG9zdHMtaGFiaXRhdC1ob21lLWRlZGljYXRpb24tY2VyZW1vbnkv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3Nhdi5jb20vbmV3cy9oYWJpdGF0LWZvci1odW1hbml0eS1ob3N0cy1oYWJpdGF0LWhvbWUtZGVkaWNhdGlvbi1jZXJlbW9ueS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

China has been very important for Thailand in terms of both the tourism and export sectors.

The country has been Thailand's largest trading partner for nine consecutive years with bilateral trade volumes surging 33% year-on-year to US$131 billion in 2021.

Mr Danai says the company has recently refined branding strategies for cosmetic products in China.

Thailand and China have also enjoyed very strong trade relations and diverse forms of cooperation including bilateral trade agreements the Asean-China Free Trade Agreement and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.

China is regarded as a lucrative market and many cosmetic brands across the world are revving up to tap into a vast business opportunity given the sheer number of consumers in the country.

For example the Mistine brand only entered the Chinese market in 2016. After just six years Mistine is the best-selling sunscreen and foundation brand on Tmall a popular Chinese e-commerce platform with claims that sales have outperformed the world's most famous cosmetic brands such as Estee Lauder Anessa Lancome and Yves Saint Laurent.

REBRANDING TO KEEP THE BUSINESS AFLOAT

In its bid to maintain sales in China amid the Covid-19 outbreaks Danai Derojanawong president of Better Way (Thailand) Co the operator of Mistine single-level direct sales in Thailand recently refined the company's branding strategies for cosmetic products.

Under the rebranding scheme applicable in both the domestic and Chinese markets the company has changed its product images pricing structure and product positioning.

The existing Mistine logo will be retained for products sold through direct sales channels while a new logo will be used for products sold via retail wholesale and online channels.

Such a branding strategy allows the company to communicate more clearly to each customer segment.

""The method of advertising has changed. In the past Mistine products were endorsed by Thai superstars. Now superstars no longer have the same influence over the new generation of customers' buying decisions. In our new communications we instead use people in each area to represent the beauty values'' Mr Danai said.

Moreover the company has renovated its Mistine stores in some locations with new images and product packaging made more minimal to appeal to the new generation of consumers.

""We now put more focus on international markets especially China and online channels after Thailand's overall direct sales business fell by 34% a year during the Covid-19 pandemic. The pandemic and the government's consumption stimulus measures have led Thai citizens to spend more via digital platforms'' Mr Danai said.

In fact Mistine has been frequently adapting and changing ever since it entered the China market. At the start of its Chinese entry in 2016 the company focused on make-up products such as eyeliner and mascara. With customer loyalty in make-up products declining the company later shifted to skin care products such as sunscreen and foundation. Currently 95% of Mistine sales in China come from digital platforms.

Besides Mistine's presence on major Chinese e-commerce platforms the brand has also ventured into offline channels through partnerships with retail brands including Watsons KKC and Sanfu spanning more than 6000 points of sale.

INTERNATIONAL PRESENCE BEEFED UP

Mistine has also recently partnered with Cathay Capital and Shanghai-based equity firm EverYi Capital to roll out a $31 million Series A round of financing in China aiming to raise funds to further develop and strengthen its R&D and supply-chain capabilities together with team building.

The plans also aim to further deepen its omnichannel operational capabilities incubate new brands and increase Mistine's sales in China to 9-10 billion baht this year from 2.4 billion baht in 2021.

""Mistine is very popular for China's sunscreen lovers because our products are produced in Thailand which has tropical weather. Our products appeal to younger Chinese customers who do not want to get tanned'' Mr Danai said. ""Thai cosmetic brands are second to none in the world. The Mistine sunscreen product was ranked top-selling on the Tmall platform in 2021 ahead of Shiseido's Anessa product and was also ranked top for foundation well ahead of major popular European brands'' Mr Danai said.

Mistine's brand recognition was also credited to the popularity of the Lost in Thailand movie leading to an avalanche of Chinese visitors.

""Tourists are some of our most important brand ambassadors because our products are normally taken back to their homeland as a souvenir"" said Mr Danai.

""But to sustain the business in China in the long run we have to continue investing in research and development and seek new Thai ingredients such as Thai herbs to add value to the products"" Mr Danai said adding that success relies on speedy changes and non-stop development.

Mistine's direct sales business was started in Thailand in 1988 by Amornthep Derojanawong Mr Danai's father in three shophouses with fewer than 10 staff. In its first year of operation the business recorded sales of 16-17 million baht.

Now the business has a presence in more than 20 countries including Cambodia Laos Myanmar the Philippines Indonesia and China. Its products are made in both Thailand and China in order to balance business risks.

According to Mr Danai there is also market potential in Russia for the Mistine brand. Because of the ongoing war in Ukraine Russian consumers have shunned US and European brands.

""We see Russia's potential because many Russians have visited Thailand over the past 5-6 years. Once the war situation eases we will come up with a clear direction for the Russian market. To become an international brand is Mistine's long-term mission'' Mr Danai said.",,,,,,,,,

Find Furbies scary? You might want to look away.

Because no matter how creepy you find those little furry owl things you’re going to find these even more unsettling.

Sophie Stark is a student artist whose specialty is creating nightmareish takes on the classic Furby toy.

Using a real Furby as a makeshift mould she creates creatures that look like they’re made of meat spaghetti hoops and baked beans.

The end result is… horrifying.

But Sophie’s work which includes Skinby (a naked Furby with silicone breasts) Wormby (which looks like it’s made of worms) and Meatby (a meat Furby of course) has earned her more than $100000.

The 24-year-old’s Furby journey began when she was given a Furby and after some experimentation she began selling her works for $350-500 a pop.

Sophie Stark from Los Angeles California said: ‘It’s not something I’d spend money on so when people said they would I thought they were joking.

‘I’ve never sold work before so I’m baffled that such a strange idea is my first money maker.

‘It was a happy accident. It started as just a hobby to keep me occupied.

Sophie creates all sorts of unsettling takes on the classic Furby such as this spaghetti hoop monster (Picture: Kennedy News/Sophie Stark)

This is skinby (Picture: Kennedy News/Sophie Stark)

‘They are weird but that’s their appeal. People like to own a bit of culture that’s provocative and uncomfortable.

‘I know some people who have bought it because their friend hates it.

‘It’s gross but it’s not totally unsettling. It’s about taking a toy and making it completely different.’

Sophie makes the bizarre products by creating a clay sculpture painting silicone over it then covering it with pieces of plaster bandage.

Sophie sells her works for up to $500 a pop (Picture: Kennedy News/Sophie Stark)

After it’s dried she removes the plaster and clay sculpture to reveal the work’s final mould which she fills with coloured silicone.

Three hours later the model is ready for her to paint. She adds some signature Furby-like eyes and tiny toy doll eyelashes to complete the look.

Sophie admits that she finds the original Furby a bit creepy so making her own out of gross items doesn’t feel sacrilegious.

Hello (Picture: Kennedy News/Sophie Stark)

‘I had a Furby as a kid and I was a little afraid of it’ she explained. ‘They’re strange because they feel a little too real and you buy into them too much.

‘I think I need to adjust my prices though because what I use to make them is so expensive so probably only half of what I’ve earned has been profit.

‘I spend the rest making other artwork and paying for my studio so I don’t save as much as you’d think. All of the money goes back into the business.

‘I can’t say that I got rich making Furbies because I have no money. I don’t think any artist gets rich in the first two years of selling anyway.’

When you think of Walt Disney World Resort you may think of things like the monorail Cinderella Castle Mickey pretzels and fireworks. Disney World has four incredible theme parks — Magic Kingdom EPCOT Hollywood Studios and Animal Kingdom — each with its own unique feel. While a Park like the Magic Kingdom is always a popular choice one theme park has been gaining in popularity in recent years — Disney’s Animal Kingdom Park. Some consider the Animal Kingdom a little out of the way but it offers experiences unlike any other.

The creative mind behind the creation of Animal Kingdom is none other than Disney Legend and Imagineer extraordinaire Joe Rohde. Rohde began his career with The Walt Disney Company in 1980 when he worked as a model designer and scenic painter at EPCOT’s Mexico Pavilion. Rohde worked his way up and became the lead designer of Animal Kingdom and the reason that Guests can ride one of the best roller coasters Expedition Everest – Legend of the Forbidden Mountain.

If you have ridden Expedition Everest before then you know that the ride has you board a train at the Everest base camp. You ascend the mountain ready to explore the Himalayas — home to the legendary Yeti — when suddenly you encounter a torn-up track. You then shoot backward into the mountain after a brief pause you see the Yeti’s shadow and your train gets out of there as fast as possible. From there you drop down a fun steep hill and the excitement doesn’t end until you arrive safely back at base camp.

For many people the best part of the ride is when the train goes backward and pauses while you watch the Yeti. What you may not know is that the choice to pause the ride was apparently a controversial one. Rohde shared that little-known fact on Twitter when someone commented on how much they love the pause and how it makes the ride.

That pause in the middle was really controversial… Even people on the team were like “it’s a ride!!! we’re supposed to do something” But that moment is the pivot of the whole experience and I think folks need a sec to register the tonal change. Glad it works

Glad it works https://t.co/61Qg60Flpy — Joe Rohde (@Joe_Rohde) August 19 2022

Expedition Everest is not the only exciting ride that Rohde and his Imagineering team brought to Disney’s Animal Kingdom. If you are looking for a wild ride down a raging river then you can take a ride on Kali River Rapids. You can also take an incredible journey on the back of a banshee if you head over to Pandora – The World of Avatar which was also created by Rohde and opened in 2017. If seeing animals like elephants and rhinos are more your speed then you can take a ride on Kilimanjaro Safaris.

What you probably didn’t know is that DeLorean has an ace up its sleeve. Actually two of them but one is closer to reality than the other.

The Alpha5 is old news already. But with it the manufacturer brought along two fresh concepts at their first ever DeLorean House during this year’s Pebble Beach Automotive Week.We’re talking about the 2024 Alpha5 Plasmatail and the 2040 Omega which took the stage on August 20 during the brand’s “A Glimpse Into The Future” event.There’s a long way to go until 2040 but the Omega concept is quite interesting. Inspired by Baja-themed off-road racing it represents the brand’s departure from traditional design celebrating mobility and driving.But taking a step back closer to reality we have the 2024 Alpha5 Plasmatail shooting brake which was “designed as an extension of the original coupe” according to the brand.Just like the original the Plasmatail has 4 seats but offers extra storage space. The rear side of the car is pretty much identical to the coupe version with most of the same elements present except there’s no louvered rear window and the roofline is sloped down and ended with a spoiler.""There was this enormous responsibility to make sure we honored the history of the DeLorean brand but an even greater responsibility in curating its future. I think we did both with Alpha5"" said Troy Beetz Chief Marketing Officer.The Alpha5 is expected to hit production in 2024 with a limited number of 88 units. If the company can navigate any upcoming challenges  maybe we’ll also get to see their Plasmatail concept hit the road sometime in the future.In the meantime you can check out photos from the event below via the brand's Instagram account.",,,,,,

The company envisions up to 2.4 million square feet that could be built relatively quickly under existing zoning and another 2 million square feet or more that would evolve over time with the right market conditions and zoning changes. Davis has not yet disclosed plans for the property’s waterfront area.

During the past few weeks The Davis Companies has been sharing its preliminary plans for the ExxonMobil property. The Boston-based developer recently secured an agreement to buy the heavily contaminated site — technically several connected parcels stretching from Sweetser Circle at the intersection of routes 99 and 16 down to the Mystic River waterfront.

One of Greater Boston’s biggest developments in years is taking shape just north of the Boston city line on a sprawling 95-acre fuel tank farm in Everett.

City councilors welcomed the potential to clean up the property but raised concerns about traffic and school crowding during a meeting earlier this month with two representatives for Davis.

“It’s almost like we’re adding an adjacent city to the City of Everett” city councilor Stephanie Martins said in an interview. “We need to really balance the existing and the new in a way that is sustainable.”

Everett Mayor Carlo DeMaria is among those who hope the Davis redevelopment can be the impetus to finally extend the Silver Line rapid bus service into Everett and maybe even prompt a train station to be built there. Tracks for the MBTA’s Newburyport/Rockport line traverse Everett near the ExxonMobil property but there are no stops in the city.

“One of the most critical components of this project is the chance for us to attract new commercial businesses and job opportunities for our residents” DeMaria said of the Davis project. “I also think that the size and scale of this type of development will help force the state to move forward with using federal dollars available to it for the public transit improvements that I have been advocating for over the past several years.”

The potential redevelopment of the ExxonMobil tank farm comes at a pivotal point in the metamorphosis of the section of Everett around Lower Broadway transforming it from what was widely seen as home to a gritty industrial dumping ground on Boston’s doorstep to an entertainment destination with desirable housing and high-paying tech jobs. Wynn Resorts helped kick things off by opening its gleaming $2.6 billion casino and hotel in 2019 where a Monsanto chemical plant once stood overlooking the Mystic. Wynn also bought land across Broadway (Route 99) for redevelopment and is pursuing plans for a concert-and-conference venue for one of those properties to be connected to Wynn’s Encore Boston Harbor casino by an overhead footbridge.

Meanwhile Constellation Energy put a 40-plus-acre portion of its Mystic power plant property across from the casino on the market and hopes to wrap up that sale by the end of the year. Among the potential uses for that property that are being discussed: a stadium for the New England Revolution pro soccer team owned by the Kraft Group. Constellation plans to eventually shutter the two remaining gas-fired units at the power plant in two years.

The biggest of all of these is the ExxonMobil property which has been home to some form of petroleum storage and distribution since the 1920s.

Mike Cantalupa chief development officer for Davis told the city council that the developer will seek tax incentives or other public subsidies from city and state officials to help offset environmental remediation and infrastructure costs.

“The first and foremost issue on the site is to clean it up and it comes at a tremendous cost” Cantalupa said. “We like to think we bring creative solutions to complex problems. ... We can’t be the sole provider but we need to solve them cooperatively and with the city’s input.”

Davis officials want to start with a 1 million-square-foot first phase with three buildings — 300 to 350 apartments in one warehouse storage in a second and advanced manufacturing in the third. (Davis is currently developing a warehouse next door rumored to be for Amazon.)

The project features two distinct sections: a residential area and an industrial area through the center of the property around Beacham Street to feature warehouses as well as high-tech and life sciences manufacturing. Perkins&Will

At full buildout Davis sees the potential for more than 4 million square feet of development taking place including apartment towers and public green space — as well as labs and biomanufacturing in part aimed at life sciences companies headquartered a short drive away in Cambridge.

“We don’t think this is your grandfather’s industrial park — buildings with solid block walls and you don’t know what’s going on inside the buildings” Cantalupa said. “The buildings and the architecture need to be attractive.”

Reassuring city councilors’ concerns about schools and traffic could pose another challenge.

Martins for example ticked off a list of potential issues with the development on her campaign Facebook page on Wednesday.

She said a solid commitment from state officials for a new train station is imperative as is a traffic mitigation plan to address the congestion along Route 99 and the Sullivan Square rotary in nearby Charlestown. She also wants to see a new fire and police substation built in the Lower Broadway area to accommodate all the new development.

“Anything seems better than what we have. I must say the cleanup the remediation are huge positives” Martins said. “But whatever we’re bringing to the city must be done right.”

Jim Schultz his newly minted Republican challenger has made an issue of the suit on the campaign trail. In an interview he described it as ""frivolous"" and said the Attorney General's Office should focus on violent crime by hiring more prosecutors in that area.

""It has zero chance at succeeding"" Schultz said of the fossil fuel lawsuit. ""It's fundamentally motivated by headlines and pleasing one side of the political aisle.""

Minnesota's isn't the only climate change lawsuit in the court system right now — there are more than 20 from cities counties and states across the country. Very few have been dismissed.

""This lawsuit is in the long and successful tradition of Minnesota attorneys general standing up to protect Minnesotans from corporate fraud and deception by Big Tobacco Big Pharma and now Big Oil"" Ellison wrote in an e-mailed statement. ""This is what Minnesotans expect from their attorney general. It's the right fight to be having.""

The litigation argues that the American Petroleum Institute ExxonMobil and Koch Industries misled Minnesota consumers for years about the consequences of burning oil and gas. It argues that the state ""has already experienced billions of dollars of economic harm due to climate change"" and without action ""will continue to suffer billions of dollars of damage through midcentury.""

There is broad scientific agreement that burning fossil fuels has overheated the planet by belching carbon dioxide and other gases into the atmosphere supercharging disasters like floods droughts and wildfires.

In the suit Minnesota asks for the defendants to publish any research they possess relating to climate change and to fund a public education campaign about climate change. It also asks for unspecified restitution and damages.

It's still not clear how judges and juries would view this legal maneuver to hold the fossil fuel industry accountable or if the questions will even get their day in court.

A wave of litigation

Minnesota's lawsuit and similar ones elsewhere hinge on the claim that fossil fuel companies duped consumers even as they knew that burning oil and gas would make the planet hotter said Korey Silverman-Roati a fellow with the Sabin Canter for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. Michael Burger the executive director of the center also works with Sher Edling the law firm handling Minnesota's case and others.

The cases are largely stuck on the same question: whether they should be heard in state or federal court. Almost all were originally filed in state court and the defendants have tried to move them to federal venues.

""This wave of litigation started in 2017 so we're coming up on the fifth year of these cases and we're still sort of mired in this"" Silverman-Roati said.

Oil companies and other defendants argue that as a national or international issue climate change should be heard in a federal courtroom.

But if they are heard there they face the hurdle of a 2011 Supreme Court case that makes it harder to claim fossil fuel emissions are a nuisance under federal common law. The case American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut determined that the Clean Air Act not lawsuits are the way to deal with some of these claims Silverman-Roati said.

So if the cases do stay in federal court and the court decides they're being pursued under common law they're in danger of being dismissed.

One case in New York that originated in federal court has since been dismissed. But in cases that were first filed at the state level federal courts and appeals courts have uniformly been sending them back there for consideration Silverman-Roati said.

Consumers and criminals

Minnesota's suit was filed in 2020. American Petroleum Institute is an industry group. One of the two oil companies sued Koch Industries runs the Pine Bend Oil Refinery in Rosemount though a subsidiary Flint Hills Resources which is also a named defendant.

The lawsuit cites internal corporate research particularly from ExxonMobil conducted as far back as the late 1950s that showed burning fossil fuels was increasing planet-warming gases in the atmosphere. It also includes examples of internal strategy documents from the late 1980s onward that call for injecting uncertainty into scientific discussions of global warming.

The litigation is in limbo at the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals as Minnesota argues it should be sent back to state court. Oral arguments were held in January. John Stiles a spokesman for the Attorney General's Office said in an email that an appeals decision isn't expected before this autumn at the soonest.

In an email an ExxonMobil spokesman wrote that the suit was ""a waste of millions of dollars of taxpayer money"" and doesn't reduce the risks of climate change. An API spokeswoman wrote that in the past two decades the industry ""has achieved its goal of providing affordable reliable American energy to U.S. consumers while substantially reducing emissions."" A spokesman for Flint Hills wrote that the firm strongly disputes ""any allegation that our company has ever been deceptive or dishonest with respect to the issue of the changing climate.""

Including Koch Industries sets Minnesota's suit apart from others across the country. Pine Bend produces about half of the gasoline sold in Minnesota according to research cited in the suit. It employs more than 1000 people according to the refinery's website.

Schultz argued the claims in the suit would fall apart. Asked whether the office should have a role in addressing climate change Schultz said ""The Attorney General's Office is not supposed to be engaging in far left political activism or activism of any kind.""

He added ""I will not engage in things like this that are fundamentally about business harassment.""

Ellison however argued in an e-mail that ""ExxonMobil Koch Industries and the American Petroleum Institute knew for decades their industries were a major source of climate change and were causing Minnesotans long-term harm.""

Oil stocks tend to be volatile due to uncertainties in the oil markets which often experience elongated periods of boom and bust. Losing faith in the viability of oil and gas as an energy source and selling stocks when the markets aren't favorable can prove to be a costly mistake. If you plan to invest in energy stocks you should have a long-term investment horizon.

Let's look at why keeping a long-term horizon is important and the top stocks you can buy and hold for the next decade and beyond.

Fluctuations in oil prices

Over the past two decades Brent crude oil prices fluctuated significantly -- from over $120 per barrel to below $40 per barrel. Domestic benchmark West Texas Intermediate also moved largely in tandem with the global prices.

Indeed profits that the integrated oil and gas companies such as ExxonMobil (XOM 1.97%) and Chevron (CVX 1.79%) make when oil prices are $120 per barrel are quite different from those made if prices fall below $40 per barrel. The performance of oil and gas stocks over the last 10-year period was not impressive largely due to low energy commodity prices.

As the chart shows top oil and gas stocks -- ExxonMobil Chevron Kinder Morgan (KMI 1.06%) Williams Companies (WMB 0.66%) and Enterprise Products Partners (EPD 0.84%) -- underperformed the S&P 500 Index over this period. Notably the chart starts in 2012 when oil and energy stock prices were very high. Still the recent rise in energy stock prices has boosted the returns on these stocks back into the green.

Let's move back a little to see how energy stocks have fared over the last two decades. Kinder Morgan is eliminated because it didn't go public until 2011.

Chevron Williams Companies and Enterprise Products Partners outperformed the S&P 500 Index in total returns over the last 20 years. If we go back further the top performers change again. Still most stocks outperformed the market.

Notably all five stocks outperformed the broader market in the last year.

The takeaway is that if you invest in strong well-managed energy companies with diversified assets and hold the stocks long term you'll generate handsome returns while diversifying your portfolio.

Top energy stocks

Chevron and ExxonMobil are among the largest integrated oil companies in the world. Both have been operating for decades generating handsome returns for their shareholders. Both Chevron and ExxonMobil are Dividend Aristocrats with Chevron raising its dividend for 35 years in a row and ExxonMobil for 39. Although some investors may prefer one over the other there are several things to like about both.

If you don't like integrated oil stocks' volatile earnings and prices you can consider companies operating in the midstream energy space. These companies are primarily involved in transporting and storing oil gas and natural gas liquids. Their earnings are relatively stable compared to oil and gas producers as they typically generate fee-based cash flow based on volumes transported or stored.

Enterprise Products Partners Kinder Morgan and Williams Companies are among the top midstream stocks to consider buying now. Regular dividend income contributed significantly to the handsome total returns these stocks generated over years as discussed above.

Enterprise Products Partners stock offers an attractive distribution yield of 6.9%. The company has been growing its dividend for 24 consecutive years and looks well placed to continue growing them in the years to come.

Kinder Morgan stock offers a dividend yield of 5.9%. The expected demand growth for natural gas offers visible growth opportunities for Kinder Morgan in the coming decades. At the same time the company is looking to expand its operations in the renewable energy space. Likewise Williams Companies is focused on high-return expansion projects and the stock offers an attractive yield of 4.9%. In all investing in these five energy stocks for the long term could significantly enhance your portfolio returns.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vZGVtZXJhcmF3YXZlcy5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8yMC9vbmx5LXdlc3Rlcm4tdGVjaG5vbG9naWVzLXdpbGwtYmUtdXNlZC1mb3ItZ2FzLXRvLXNob3JlLXBvd2VyLXBsYW50L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Only Western technologies will be used for gas-to-shore power plant,"Only Western technologies will be used for gas-to-shore power plant

Last Updated on Saturday 20 August 2022 1:13 by Denis Chabrol

Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo on Friday announced that bids for the estimated US$700 million gas-to-shore power plant and Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) would have to be manufactured by one of two Western companies.

He said bidders would have to propose using either Siemens or General Electric (GE) technologies but he gave no reason for government deciding to limit its preferences to those two. “We’ve defined the technology we want to use which is Western technology- either Siemens or GE- Western technology. That has been defined so whoever the bidder is they’d have to use technology that we are comfortable with” he told a news conference.

According to Mr Jagdeo the nine prequalified companies now have to submit tenders for the power plant and the NGL facility during the first week of September.

The Guyana government’s announcement came weeks after signing a memorandum of understanding for a US$2 billion line of credit from the United States Export-Import (EXIM) Bank which would see American companies taking advantage of infrastructure opportunities in this emerging oil and gas economy.

Prior to the Summit of the Americas that was held earlier this year concerns had been raised by the US and EU that they had been losing influence in Latin America and the Caribbean to China. Guyana has in recent years been awarding multi-million dollar contracts to Chinese companies to build infrastructural projects.

The Guyana government expects the power plant which would be built at Wales West Bank Demerara to be completed by 2024 and the NGL plant by 2025.

ExxonMobil is paying for the construction of the estimated US$1 billion pipeline from cost oil and after its construction it would be insured to cater for leaks or ruptures. “We don’t know the total cost of the project” he said. Mr Jagdeo said the route for the pipeline was still being mapped and environmental studies conducted.

ExxonMobil is expected to supply 50 million cubic feet of natural gas via the pipeline which has the capacity of up to another 80 million cubic feet per day Mr Jagdeo said.

He restated that the cost of electricity would be reduced to 4 US cents per kilowatt hour down from 30 US cents and cooking gas would be produced free of cost."

Remo

It was a celebration of a strategic groundbreaking alliance that is poised to transform the future of Philippine real estate.

Top officials of real estate giants Federal Land Inc. and Nomura Real Estate Development Co. Ltd. (NRE) of Japan came together last week for the highly anticipated launch of their joint venture company Federal Land NRE Global Inc. (FNG).

FNG brings together the decades-worth of expertise of Federal Land which is celebrating its 50th year in the business and NRE to create landmark projects and masterplanned smart cities that will enhance and elevate residents’ lifestyles. This skillful integration of Japanese innovation and Filipino sensibility will no doubt create new and real value in the local real estate market.

‘Perfect marriage’

Federal Land chairman Alfred Ty called this partnership with NRE as a perfect marriage of vision and values.

“We share a common long-term outlook anchored on creating world-class developments that enrich the way people live. It’s a true synergy wherein we raise each other’s performance whether in architecture technology construction management or most importantly to the quality of service rendered to our customers” Ty said.

“FNG is here to make a difference in the Philippine real estate arena and more importantly in the lives of the communities we belong to—elevating living standards by introducing innovative design parameters from Japanese concepts and international best practices” Ty explained. “We will introduce masterplanned communities in strategic locations innovative features sustainable solutions and cutting-edge technologies that fit today’s evolving and modernizing lifestyle. That’s the vision of FNG.”

An important market

NRE chair Eiji Kutsukake who flew in with his team for the occasion meanwhile pointed out that the Philippines is one of the most important markets for their company and as such they are looking to further expand their presence here over the long term.

NRE’s continued investments particularly in FNG indeed signals an unwavering vote of confidence on the local real estate market. To recall NRE’s collaboration with Federal Land started in 2017 along with Japan’s Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings Ltd. Through Sunshine Fort North Bonifacio Realty Development Corp. the companies are currently building The Seasons Residences an award winning multi-tower residential complex and the first MITSUKOSHI in the Philippines in Bonifacio Global City.

“FNG is not just a special purpose company [that will be on a] project by project basis but a growing constant company for a long time business in the Philippines” Kutsukake said.

“FNG with the spirit of equal partnership between FLI and NRE seeks to create new value that has never existed before by leveraging on each other’s strengths cooperating with each other and using various ideas and knowledge. We will combine our strengths—the broad business infrastructure that the GT Capital group has the local real estate business experience and landbank that FLI has and the know-how and experience that NRE has contributed to Japan and overseas. We will create sustainable communities beyond generation in response to local needs and unique developments utilizing technologies that are new in the Philippines” he explained.

Traditional ceremonies

To mark FNG’s launch officials held the traditional Japanese ceremony Kagami Wari which literally translates to opening the lid. The round wooden lid of the barrel was broken open with wooden mallets by the top officials of Federal Land and NRE signifying the release of good fortune.

A Daruma doll was presented as well with Kutsukake drawing on one eye while the other was left blank. According to Japanese custom the eyes of the Daruma doll are initially blank. You fill in one eye after making a wish and the other eye only after the goal is completed. The drawing of the eyes signifies giving life and soul to the Daruma by opening its mind’s eye.

Officials likewise unveiled the FNG logo design which was inspired by the forearm handshake to symbolize peace. In ancient times the forearm handshake was a common gesture to show that both parties are not wearing weapons. Such is the depth of Federal Land and NRE’s partnership—it not only nurtures friendship but it also maintains a common pursuit.

Long term plan

These remarkable pronouncements are now creating buzz and excitement in the market. There’s a lot of expectations riding on FNG and how it can indeed elevate the game and transform the landscape—especially after the officials unveiled plans over the next 25 years.

Federal Land president and COO Thomas Mirasol revealed that FNG will launch projects next year in Metro Manila Cavite and Cebu­—which span a total of about 250 hectares.

The plan Mirasol said is to create smart mixed-use estates that will be home to multiple towers offering residences offices and commercial spaces.

Indeed one can only expect exceptional innovative offerings to come from such a game-changing partnership built on trust and shared values. FNG is without a doubt off to a great start.

As fast as it began the postseason will come to a screeching conclusion at the Tour Championship this week as the 30 best players from the PGA Tour battle for the season-long crown.

As he did for most of the regular season Scottie Scheffler will lead the pack into Atlanta. Bouncing back from his missed cut in the first playoff event the world No. 1 played himself into contention in Delaware and reclaimed the top spot in the FedEx Cup thanks to a top-five finish at the BMW Championship.

Due to the staggered start of the Tour Championship -- more on that in a moment -- Scheffler will begin with a two-stroke lead over Cantlay and a three-stroke edge over Zalatoris who withdrew from the BMW due to injury. Despite this advantage there are still premier players right in the thick of it thanks to their strong regular seasons. Those include multiple-time winners Cameron Smith Rory McIlroy and Max Homa all of whom will be within arm's reach at the onset of play at East Lake Golf Club.

With all of that in mind let's break down the FedEx Cup Playoffs format what we've already seen what to expect at the Tour Championship and which players to expect to make one final push at the finale for the $18 million first prize.

FedEx Cup Playoffs schedule



Event Dates City Course Field Size Winner

FedEx St. Jude Championship Aug. 11-14 Memphis TPC Southwind 125

Will Zalatoris

BMW Championship Aug. 18-21 Wilmington Del. Wilmington CC 70

Patrick Cantlay

Tour Championship Aug. 25-28 Atlanta East Lake GC 30

TBD



It was a dramatic ending at the top of the leaderboard at the BMW Championship and equally as intriguing for those names who battled their way inside the top 30 cutoff point for the Tour Championship. Players such as rookie Sahith Theegala Aaron Wise and Adam Scott all displayed guts and gumption down the stretch to secure their place at East Lake. Scott became the only player to successfully play his way inside the qualifying number in each of the first two playoff events as he entered the St. Jude Championship outside the top 70 and the BMW Championship outside the top 30.

These players will be granted a minimum payday of $500000 for their efforts as well as exemptions into the Masters U.S. Open and The Open in 2023. While they are positioned well in the big events for next season they will be starting behind the eight ball given the staggered start of the Tour Championship and the importance of playing well in the postseason specifically.

Players who have taken the most advantage of the first two playoff events include Sepp Straka and Scott Stallings who will begin the Tour Championship ahead of the likes of Homa Jordan Spieth and Joaquin Niemann thanks to their efforts over the last two weeks.

This emphasis on the postseason is especially true for someone like Zalatoris who was awarded zero FedEx Cup points at the BMW Championship due to his withdrawal yet still finds his name among the top three despite his early exit in Delaware thanks to his breakthrough victory at the St. Jude Championship.

Zalatoris and Cantlay sit pretty at the Tour Championship as they begin right behind Scheffler. In the first year of this format Patrick Reed won the first playoff event and started the Tour Championship in fourth. Justin Thomas won the second playoff event and started the Tour Championship in first. In the second year Dustin Johnson and Jon Rahm won the first two events and started first and second at the Tour Championship. The same thing happened in 2021 with Finau and Cantlay. There was a lot of movement to be had -- especially for the winners of the first two events -- but ultimately the right man begins the grand finale in the lead.

Tour Championship format

Heading into the Tour Championship inside the top five or top 10 in the FedEx Cup standings is important because of how scoring is dispersed. As he was at the end of the regular season Scheffler is first in the standings after the BMW Championship and will start the Tour Championship at 10 under with the event played under normal scoring conditions from there. Cantlay will start at 8 under and so on. With so much money at stake those margins become more meaningful than even a normal week. The eventual winners of the last three FedEx Cups have started first fifth and first at the Tour Championship.

1st: Scottie Scheffler (Starts Tour Championship at -10)

2nd: Patrick Cantlay (-8)

3rd: Will Zalatoris (-7)

4th: Xander Schauffele (-6)

5th: Sam Burns (-5)

6th-10th: Cameron Smith Rory McIlroy Tony Finau Sepp Straka Sungjae Im (-4)

11th-15th: Jon Rahm Scott Stallings Justin Thomas Cameron Young Matt Fitzpatrick (-3)

16th-20th: Max Homa Hideki Matsuyama Jordan Spieth Joaquin Niemann Viktor Hovland (-2)

21st-25th: Collin Morikawa Billy Horschel Tom Hoge Corey Conners Brian Harman (-1)

26th-30th: K.H. Lee J.T. Poston Sahith Theegala Adam Scott Aaron Wise (E)

Tour Championship prize money

The numbers are startling. The winner of the Tour Championship gets $18 million. If you make it to the Tour Championship you're guaranteed $500000. Everyone who advanced to the BMW Championship is guaranteed at least $175000. Heck everyone who finished in the top 125 is guaranteed at least $120000. All of this is on top of what the first two tournaments themselves pay out. Add it all up and FedEx is giving out $75 million in bonus funds to the best players in the world.

1st: $18 million

2nd: $6.5 million

3rd: $5 million

4th: $4 million

5th: $3 million

6th: $2.5 million

7th: $2 million

8th: $1.5 million

9th: $1.25 million



10th $1 million



FedEx Cup standings

The top 10 going into the Tour Championship is fascinating. Cantlay looks to be a man on a mission after he endured a regular season that saw him unable to capture a solo victory. Scheffler has been the best player in the world since the spring and if his putter comes alive it will be difficult to upend given his two-stroke edge. Zalatoris is the ultimate wildcard as his status is unknown and this will be his first trip to East Lake as he did not participate in the FedEx Cup Playoffs a year ago.

Rank Golfer FedEx Cup points 1 Scottie Scheffler 4206 2 Patrick Cantlay 4129 3 Will Zalatoris 3680 4 Xander Schauffele 2825 5 Sam Burns 2605 6 Cameron Smith 2548 7 Rory McIlroy 2414 8 Tony Finau 2376 9 Sepp Straka 2224 10 Sungjae Im 2201

Cantlay was in pole position a year ago and should have a good understanding of what is going through Scheffler's head with a two-stroke lead. However Xander Schauffele is the guy who I believe will raise the FedEx Cup trophy. He broke through at East Lake for his first career victory back in 2017 and has since fallen in love with the place.

Scheffler and Cantlay's FedEx Cup chances will come down to their putters while Zalatoris' will come down to his driver.

But there were too many players still on the course for him to celebrate.

“It would mean the world to make the Tour Championship and stand along 29 of the other best golfers in the world” he said.

“A dream season” is how Theegala who a year ago was sweating out getting into the Korn Ferry Tour Finals when he boarded a plane for Boise not knowing whether he was in the field.

He entered Sunday sitting on the bubble and knowing what he had to do. That sort of pressure can do funny things to some golfers.

“I was like I’m in 30th place out of 70 people and I’m as nervous as if I were near the lead” he said. “I had a little bit of the shakes warming up. I couldn’t hold my hands still.”

Theegala made birdie at the first hole to settle the nerves temporarily but as he put it his round was “a wild ride.”

He was one over for the day through 11 holes when strung together three straight birdies and then drained a 37-foot birdie at 17. Still he’d hit only 1 of 14 fairways all day dead last in the field and tried something different anything to find a fairway.

“I don’t know why I tried to hit a draw. My natural shot is a cut. Tried to draw a 5-wood and it started 20 yards right of my target and then cut so I hit it 50 right” Theegala said.

He caught a good lie in order to slice one up near the green but left himself a 7-foot par putt that was worth at least $500000 – last place money next week where the rich get richer.

“That was such a grind” he said after drilling the putt to shoot 3-under 68 and finish T-15.

Laugh it up @SRTheegala 😂 See you at East Lake 💪 pic.twitter.com/Fcm5t1C2nS — PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) August 22 2022

His “dream season” continues another week as he improved to No. 28 in the FedEx Cup points standings one of two rookies along with Cameron Young to make it to Atlanta and East Lake Golf Club for the Tour Championship.

“It’s another step for me to feel like I really belong because I still don’t feel like I’m really there at the top of the game” he said.

Next week he’ll be alongside 29 of the best in the world.

Additionally to add to its environmental claims all of the company’s cars are built in Magna’s carbon-neutral factory in Graz Austria.

Founder Henrik Fisker is a mad genius designing a slew of iconic vehicles like the BMW Z8 Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage before starting his latest company Fisker Inc in 2016. The outspoken entrepreneur’s Midas touch is proving itself once again as his company has already sold out two trim levels of its Ocean SUV the Ocean Sport and Ocean Ultra. It also sold out 5000 units of its Fisker Ocean One edition.

Since the announcement of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 which changed the requirement for tax credit qualification to only include cars with final assembly in North America Fisker has been contacting interested parties in the US to mitigate any concerns about retaining the $7500 federal tax credit before the act potentially takes effect (Fisker’s vehicles no longer qualify for tax credits under the new law). Fisker told Ocean reservation holders that if they have a binding order and take delivery before the end of 2023 they still qualify for the tax credit.

The company made waves at the Consumer Electronics Show and the 2021 Los Angeles Auto Show where Henrik Fisker himself debuted the Ocean and its unusual features. Its available roof-mounted solar panels (called SolarSky) are touted to power 2000 miles of range per year. The center-mounted 17.1-inch touchscreen rotates vertically and horizontally like a personal tablet. And inside the cabin the Ocean employs all sustainable materials like recycled plastic bottles and other recycled plastics. Activate the Ocean’s “California mode” to lower all the windows (including the tailgate window) and slide back the sunroof for an open-air feel.

The Ocean the company’s base model is equipped with a single motor with 275 horsepower. Fisker says it will have 250 miles of range before needing to recharge. Stepping up a level there’s the Ultra which adds a second motor for a total output of 540 horsepower with a zero-to-60 mph time of 3.9 seconds. The Extreme and Ocean One models reduce that time to 3.6 seconds and sport 550 horsepower engines.

The Ocean SUV comes standard with what the company calls the Fisker Intelligent Pilot package which is its suite of driver-assistance technology. Included are programs for automated emergency braking blind-spot monitoring lane-keeping assist forward-collision warning and available adaptive cruise control.

With a starting price of under $40000 the electric-powered SUV is betting on the company founder’s vast experience and creativity to build and market its vehicles. Only 537 employees work for Fisker—an incredibly small number for an automaker.

One of the ways the company is staying nimble is through its “asset light” approach which means it keeps its balance sheet healthier by farming out the manufacturing to Magna Steyr’s carbon-neutral factory in Austria. In a press release Fisker said it’s exploring ways to increase production of the Ocean to meet demand in the US by the end of 2023. No promises have been made yet however. With less than 100 days to go to production Fisker is focused on getting the first set of orders out the door.

“Our asset-light rapid-product-development business model enables us to bring state-of-the-art technology like a revolving 17.1-inch center screen SolarSky sunroof and the world’s first digital radar to market earlier than other brands offering the latest technology for $68799 for our top-end fully loaded Fisker Ocean Extreme” Henrik Fisker tells PopSci.

Those who remember Fisker’s previous endeavor the luxury plug-in range-extended sports car Fisker Karma know that the CEO isn’t shy about stepping outside of what is considered “typical.” Unfortunately plagued by the bankruptcy of its battery supplier A123 Systems Fisker’s design tooling and manufacturing facility were sold to Wanxiang Group in 2014. The Chinese company renamed Fisker Automotive to Karma Automotive and Henrik Fisker started over with Fisker Inc.

Fisker says it will resume production on November 17 and ramp up to 40000-50000 units in 2023. The company will reopen the order process for the Fisker Ocean Extreme trim on November 18.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL29pbGNpdHkubmV3cy9jb21tdW5pdHkvMjAyMi8wOC8yMS9waG90b3MtZml2ZS15ZWFycy10aGUtMjAxNy1zb2xhci1lY2xpcHNlLWZlc3RpdmFsLXB1dC1jYXNwZXItb24tdGhlLXdvcmxkcy1jZW50ZXItc3RhZ2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,(PHOTOS) Five years: The 2017 Solar Eclipse Festival put Casper on the world's center stage,"CASPER Wyo. — On Aug. 21 2017 a total solar eclipse made its way from coast to coast.

According to NASA the total solar eclipse that swept across a narrow portion of the contiguous United States was seen from Lincoln Beach Oregon to Charleston South Carolina. A partial solar eclipse was visible across the entire North American continent along with parts of South America Africa and Europe.

Since the totality path traveled mainly along rural sections of the country Casper was among the prime spots for eclipse tourists for a combination of its location and accommodations. It was the culmination of years of planning and preparation for the city.

More than 1 million visitors jammed into the Wyoming that week with Casper’s center of activity based mainly around the newly-completed David Street Station outdoor plaza.

Students look skyward in the lawn of their school in Lebanon on Aug. 21 2017.

Listen

Five years ago Middle Tennesseans were able to witness one of the most miraculous kinds of celestial events: a total solar eclipse.

I had spent the day with a first-grade class at Carroll-Oakland School in Lebanon where kids wore glow-in-the-dark T-shirts and had special lessons for eclipse day. They learned about the positions of the sun and the moon (and how they intersected at times) and had eclipse-themed activities.

It was all part of making the day both accessible and momentous teacher Tammy Boothe had told me: “I wanted to find the experiments that we could do easily with 6- and 7-year-olds … to where they would really have a meaningful day that they would remember for a long time.”

Emily Siner WPLN News

For Wyatt Erwin one of the most enthusiastic first-graders I talked to on that day it seemed to work. His memories of this otherwise random day in August are remarkably clear and abundant.

He remembers coming outside and seeing his parents sister and grandmother. He remembers that his sister was too little to know what was going on; she got distracted by her iPad. He remembers the glow-in-the-dark shirts and the repeated warnings about wearing protective sunglasses.

“Another thing I remember is after it happened everybody started freaking out because like this giant flock of buzzards or whatever they were came flying over” he told me during a Zoom call last week.

At one point in our call he even recited part of the story I produced that day back to me. “I actually do remember you pulling me out in the hallway and we sat at that little lunch table where we would put our lunch boxes on and then we did an interview there” he said.

At the time Boothe told me this might be the first world event her students would remember. I’ve been thinking about this ever since. I love asking people about their earliest memory of a world event and the answers are often a jarring tragedy: Kennedy’s assassination the Challenger explosion 9/11. For this next generation it might be the pandemic.

But this event was so joyful. That seems really special for the kids in Wyatt’s class I told him.

“Yeah that’s the thing” he mused. “For every 10 bad events in the world there’s like one good one. And I’m guessing that was just one of the good ones.”

Wondering about solar eclipses? Another total eclipse will be visible in the U.S. on April 8 2024. It goes through parts of Arkansas and Kentucky but Middle Tennessee won’t be in the path of totality — nor will it be for any total eclipses this century. See a total list of eclipses here.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwYWNlLmNvbS92b3lhZ2VyLXNwYWNlY3JhZnQtNDV0aC1sYXVuY2gtYW5uaXZlcnNhcnktc2NpZW5jZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Voyager turns 45: What the iconic mission taught us and what's next,"Forty-five years ago on Aug. 20 1977 NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft launched from Cape Canaveral Florida on a Titan III-Centaur rocket embarking on a ""grand tour"" of the solar system that would include visits to the Jupiter and Saturn systems and would make it the first spacecraft to visit the ice giants Uranus and Neptune and their moons.

Voyager 2 is now 12.1 billion miles (19.5 billion kilometers) away and still sending back data on the distant and unknown heliopause and scientists are beginning to wonder how long the iconic space probe can keep going.

Designed to take advantage of a once-every-176-years alignment in the 1970s that made it possible for spacecraft to take gravity-assist slingshots from planet to planet across the solar system  the Voyager mission consisted of two probes. Voyager 2 was the first to launch with Voyager 1 following two weeks later. Both carried the famous "" Golden Record "" a 12-inch gold-plated copper disc containing sounds and images portraying the diversity of life and culture on Earth .

Now over 14.5 billion miles (23.3 billion km) away Voyager 1 is the farthest artificial object from Earth. But Voyager 2 is arguably more iconic because of its incredible multidecade tour of the giant planets.

Voyager's ""grand tour""

Though it launched second Voyager 1 was so called because it was to reach Jupiter and Saturn first — in March 1979 and November 1980 respectively — before exiting the plane of the planets where it took the famous ""Pale Blue Dot"" photo . Voyager 2 visited four planets: Jupiter in July 1979 Saturn in August 1981 Uranus in January 1986 and Neptune in August 1989.

""Both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 provided tremendous legacies for planetary exploration"" Jonathan Lunine a planetary scientist and physicist at Cornell University who is working on the Juno  Europa Clipper and James Webb Space Telescope missions told Space.com. ""Not only in what they accomplished in terms of science but also demonstrating that it was really possible to explore the outer solar system with a couple of spacecraft.""

What did the Voyager probes reveal?

Voyager's discoveries are the stuff of legend among planetary scientists many of whom still rely on the unique images from the spacecraft's wide-angle and narrow-angle cameras. The probes spotted volcanoes on Jupiter's moon Io  discovered that Jupiter's Great Red Spot is an Earth-size storm and found that the gas giant has faint rings. They studied Saturn's rings ; saw the giant moon Titan's thick Earth-like atmosphere; and revealed the tiny moon Enceladus to be geologically active.

Voyager 2 alone then visited Uranus and Neptune. The spacecraft's first-ever images of Uranus revealed dark rings the planet's tilted magnetic field and its geologically active moon Miranda. Neptune meanwhile was also discovered to have rings and many more moons than scientists initially thought. We also got to see Triton  a geologically active moon that is orbiting ""backward"" and like Pluto  is now believed to be a captured dwarf planet from the Kuiper Belt .

Voyager as a catalyst

In addition to making groundbreaking discoveries the Voyager mission helped scientists determine what merited deeper exploration. The mission revealed Jupiter to be an incredibly complex planet thus spurring NASA to launch the Galileo mission in 1989 and the Juno mission in 2011. The Voyager probes' work also helped to inspire the iconic Cassini mission to Saturn.

""Voyager 1's close flyby of Titan was the catalyst for the wonderful Cassini mission to Saturn and its Huygens probe"" Lunine said. The Huygens probe landed on the surface of Titan in 2005 and sent back an incredible video .

Voyager 2 has also been a catalyst for investigations into the role of the ice giant planets — not only in the solar system but also in distant star systems since most of the exoplanets found so far are roughly the size of Neptune and Uranus.

Voyager and NASA today

NASA has spent decades following up on the Voyager missions and those efforts continue today. The space agency's Dragonfly mission will reach Titan Saturn's largest moon in 2034 while Europa Clipper will study Jupiter's ocean moon first imaged by Voyager starting in 2030. In April the National Academies Planetary Science Decadal Survey recommended that NASA send a $4.2 billion Uranus Orbiter and Probe mission to unveil the mysterious ice giant planet and its moons in the 2040s.

It's the latest mission that's a direct consequence of Voyager 2's brief visit to the Uranus system in January 1986. ""Voyager 2's flyby of Uranus was a bull's-eye — it went directly through the plane of the moons' orbits because of the orientation of Uranus' axis to the sun "" Lunine said. That made it unlike flybys at other planets where the probes were able to visit one moon after another. ""Voyager 2 got very brief images from these moons so they're largely unexplored"" Lunine said.

Ariel and Miranda in particular are thought to be ocean worlds and so would be specifically targeted by the Uranus Orbiter and Probe. ""It's been 45 years since the launch of Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 and here we are now finally talking about a Uranus Orbiter and Probe mission"" Lunine said. ""It seems like a long time because these missions take so long to conceive of fund build launch and execute but it all comes from the intriguing peeks that we got from Voyager 2.""

How long will Voyager last?

Both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 still communicate with NASA's Deep Space Network (which itself was created to communicate with Voyager 2 at Uranus and Neptune) receiving routine commands and occasionally transmitting data to Earth. ""We are still getting data from Voyager"" Stamatios Krimigis principal investigator for the Voyager 1 and 2 probes and the Voyager Interstellar Mission said during a news conference held at COSPAR 22 in July. ""We're looking forward to getting data for probably another five or six years.""

Around the mid- to late 2020s  the probes' scientific instruments will be entirely switched off and eventually the spacecraft will go cold and silent — but their journeys into interstellar space will continue indefinitely. ""My motto is I want to be here after Voyager passes on"" said Krimigis who is in his 80s. ""But I'm not sure that's going to happen.""

In around 300 years Voyager 1 and 2 will enter the Oort cloud  the sphere of comets surrounding the solar system. About 30000 years later they'll exit the neighborhood and silently orbit the center of the Milky Way for millions of years.

Their scientific work may be almost over but the Voyager spacecraft have only just begun their journeys into the cosmos."

(AP) — Ford Motor Co. plans to appeal a $1.7 billion verdict against the automaker after a pickup truck crash that claimed the lives of a Georgia couple a company representative said Sunday.

Jurors in Gwinnett County just northeast of Atlanta returned the verdict late last week in the yearslong civil case involving what the plaintiffs’ lawyers called dangerously defective roofs on Ford pickup trucks lawyer James Butler Jr. said Sunday.

Melvin and Voncile Hill were killed in April 2014 in the rollover wreck of their 2002 Ford F-250. Their children Kim and Adam Hill were the plaintiffs in the wrongful death case.

“While our sympathies go out to the Hill family we do not believe the verdict is supported by the evidence and we plan to appeal” Ford said in a statement to The Associated Press on Sunday.

Butler said he was stunned by evidence in the case.

“I used to buy Ford trucks” Butler said on Sunday. “I thought nobody would sell a truck with a roof this weak. The damn thing is useless in a wreck. You might as well drive a convertible.”

In closing arguments lawyers hired by the company defended the actions of Ford and its engineers.

The Michigan-based automaker sought to defend the company against accusations “that Ford and its engineers acted willfully and wantonly with a conscious indifference for the safety of the people who ride in their cars when they made these decisions about roof strength” defense lawyer William Withrow Jr. said in his closing arguments according to a court transcript.

The allegation that Ford was irresponsible and willfully made decisions that put customers at risk is “simply not the case” another defense lawyer Paul Malek said in the same closing argument.

Lawyers for the plaintiffs had submitted evidence of nearly 80 similar rollover wrecks that involved truck roofs being crushed that injured or killed motorists Butler’s law firm Butler Prather LLP said in a statement.

“More deaths and severe injuries are certain because millions of these trucks are on the road” Butler’s co-counsel Gerald Davidson said in the statement.

“An award of punitive damages to hopefully warn people riding around in the millions of those trucks Ford sold was the reason the Hill family insisted on a verdict” Butler said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzIwL2p1cnktc2xhbXMtZm9yZC13aXRoLTEtN2ItdmVyZGljdC1vdmVyLWRlYWRseS0yMDE0LWNyYXNoL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jury slams Ford with $1.7B verdict over deadly 2014 crash,"A Georgia jury has hit Ford Motor Co. with the biggest monetary verdict in state history — $1.7 billion — involving a wrongful death suit stemming from a 2014 rollover crash that killed a couple.

A Gwinnett County jury ruled in a favor of a lawsuit brought by the children of Voncile Hill 62 and her husband Melvin Hill 74 who were killed after a tire blew out on a local highway in 2014 and their 2002 Ford Super Duty F-250 pickup rolled over. The couple was farmers en route to pick up a tractor part the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

Voncile Hill and her husband Melvin Hill were killed when their 2002 Ford Super Duty F-250 pickup flipped over from a blown tire in 2014.

Ford sold 5.2 million “Super Duty” trucks with weak roofs that would crush people inside during rollovers the jury determined. The flaw was present in all “Super Duty” models between 1999 and 2016 their lawyer James E. Butler said.

Attorneys showed evidence at the trial of nearly 80 similar wrecks where people had been killed or injured when the trucks’ roofs crushed them during rollovers.

Ford has refused to say how many similar incidents it is aware of. Nor has the car giant ever issued a recall Butler said.

The suit also targeted Pep Boys for installing the wrong size tires on the truck causing the blowout.

The jury awarded more than $24 million to Kim and Adam Hill for their parents’ wrongful deaths and pain and suffering. The jury determined 30% of the damages went against Pep Boys.

Businesses and governments spend billions upon billions each year to protect their assets from cyberattacks. And Statista expects that global market to increase from $183 billion to $539 billion by the end of the decade.

The industry isn't as fragmented as one might think. The top five cybersecurity exchange-traded funds (ETFs) according to The Motley Fool all have CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD 1.33%) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW -2.42%) as Top 10 holdings and three of the ETFs have both in their top five. And for a good reason as we'll discuss below.

We all know about ransomware and breaches which companies defend against daily but cyberattacks have also become a strategy for some nations. Cyberattacks increased in Ukraine as the Russian invasion began and Taiwan was hit with cyberattacks during U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's recent visit.

Much of our crucial infrastructure defense in the U.S. falls on the private sector. Increasing tensions make cybersecurity companies essential and therefore strong long-term investments.

CrowdStrike is leveraging growth

CrowdStrike is a force in the cybersecurity industry. Its cloud-based solutions powered by artificial intelligence attract major clients including over half of the Fortune 500 and 15 of the top 20 banks in the U.S. Its total customer base is exploding and the growth over the prior four fiscal years is shown below.

CrowdStrike added another 1620 customers in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and now has 17945.

What do we mean by leveraging this growth? CrowdStrike rapidly increases the amount its customers spend with it each period with a dollar-based net retention rate consistently over 120%. For example a customer might sign a contract for CrowdStrike services for one year at $50000. Then the following year it adds more modules and spends $60000.

CrowdStrike's annual recurring revenue has increased from $71 million in the first quarter of 208 to over $1.9 billion as of the 2023 first quarter. The company is not yet generating profits on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) but posted $442 million in free cash flow last fiscal year.

CrowdStrike should be near the top of the list for growth-oriented investors.

Palo Alto Networks is an industry leader

Palo Alto Networks is an established leader with the most sales of any independent security company. It has tremendous reach offering network cloud zero-trust and endpoint security and other products and services.

Management is expected to release fourth-quarter and fiscal-year 2022 earnings after market close on Monday Aug. 22. Investors should be optimistic since Palo Alto raised its full-year guidance last quarter. It now expects revenue to come in at $5.5 billion for the fiscal year representing a 29% increase year over year.

The earnings report could boost the stock given that the valuation lags behind established competitors like Fortinet as shown below.

Palo Alto posts impressive non-GAAP earnings per share and free cash flow but is not GAAP profitable due to stock-based compensation (SBC). Management has made it a goal to reduce its SBC as a percentage of revenue. This should be a positive for shareholders.

Both companies are taking advantage of ballooning spending on cyberdefense. The market can be volatile in the short term but long-term investors should do well owning a piece of these innovative companies.",,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s not often you’ll find a new island but that’s precisely what those familiar with West Palm Beach will find. It’s been built up for animals and marine life to thrive on.

While one group of volunteers would typically be hard at work for Carrier Global Corporation they paused recently to help plant 1000 mangroves.

""It is actually pretty easy"" volunteer Korinti Recalde said. ""The sand is OK. There's not that many rocks though. Yeah it wasn't so bad.""

It’s fun that Recalde said has meaning behind it.

Palm Beach County and The Nature Conservancy collaborated by building a tiny remnant island to an acre.

""We have a number of what we call interventions"" said Joseph Schmidt climate project manager with The Nature Conservancy. ""We've got some breakwaters. We've got some areas for oyster reefs and we've got an intertidal mangrove flat that we're planting today with volunteers from the carrier corporation.""

An elevated bird nesting island was also created.

Looking back he has no regrets,"Don Bluth first found his “laughing place” — a term he uses to refer to an intangible mental refuge from the drudgery of existence — in the films of his lifelong hero Walt Disney.

Today an animation legend in his own hard-fought right Bluth 84 recalls riding his horse into town to watch movies at the local cinema as a farm boy in Payson Utah. Born within just a few months of the premiere of Disney’s first animated feature “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs” in 1937 his life has run parallel to the history of the medium in the U.S.

“Animation brought my spirits up. Everything about it said ‘That's where you should go'” Bluth told The Times over the phone from his home in Scottsdale Ariz. where he has lived and worked for several decades.

Led by charming mice adorable dinosaurs determined princesses and myriad other fantastical beings Bluth’s collection of animated features rivaled the output of Walt Disney Studios during the 1980s and '90s in their artistic quality all of them magnificently hand-drawn and even more significantly for Bluth in their thematic substance.

Of the 11 feature projects he realized over 20 years of intense dedication — often working with limited budgets and against the grain of the industry — some of the most illustrious include “The Secret of NIMH” (1982) “An American Tail” (1986) “The Land Before Time” (1988) “All Dogs Go to Heaven” (1989) and “Anastasia” (1997).

For the animator raised in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints these wondrous fables were the manifestation of his divine purpose meant to be shared with the world.

“I discovered over the years that the more you give the more you get. When you're in the service of people and you help them out there's a source of joy that comes from that” he said. “If I was going to make an animated film I didn’t want to just make people laugh. I wanted them to have something to take home that could make their lives a little better.”

Compiled of professional anecdotes and innermost thoughts Bluth’s recently released tell-all autobiography “Somewhere Out There: My Animated Life” opens the vault of his memories in his own uniquely philosophical words.

“I've had such a wonderful life and one day I just said to myself ‘I should write down a few things’ not with the idea of making a book but just for my own enjoyment just to write down everything that's happened in my life” he explained.

In time a friend suggested he should turn the inspired loose writings into a memoir and Bluth thought of it as an opportunity to disclose the greater truths he believes in.

“For years and years all I've talked about is animation the characters and all the usual questions I get asked but I've never revealed who I am like the man behind the curtain in ‘Wizard of Oz.’ So I said ‘If at my age I’m going to talk to people I need to tell them exactly what I feel and what I've gone through'” he said. “That spiritual part has a great deal to do with what I did in the movies but I've never fessed up to that before.”

The Disney era

For a young and reserved Bluth Walt Disney was an archetype of masculinity he could aspire to. Not an athlete or a physically imposing figure but an artist with a vision that resonated with him. At 18 Bluth was hired by Disney's studio as an in-betweener — the artist who draws the middle frames in animation to make the action smoother — on the gorgeous princess saga “Sleeping Beauty.”

Bluth saw Disney in the flesh on two occasions during his time at the studio. First from afar while hiding behind some bushes with friends as his idol shot an episode of the “The Mickey Mouse Club.”

“It was like meeting Santa Claus for the first time a very legendary image” Bluth remembered.

And once more after embarrassingly running into him and falling to the ground during a volleyball game. This time Disney spoke to him.

“I looked up and it was like the sun was behind him and I didn't know who I bumped into but then I heard his voice and he said ‘If you will slow down young man you'll go a lot further.’ He stepped over me and walked on down the street.”

Despite his profound admiration for Disney’s storytelling prowess Bluth never aimed to imitate him. “Everyone kept saying ‘I'm going to be the next Walt Disney'” he recalled of some of his colleagues. But he was convinced that if their motivation was strictly financial and not guided by a strong work ethic and spirituality they would fail.

“I didn't want to be Walt. There was only one of those and I'm me. I liked the medium that he worked in and I wanted to see if I could work in it and be successful” Bluth said.

For 20 years Bluth worked on a variety of Disney projects including “The Sword in the Stone” “Robin Hood” “The Rescuers” and “Pete's Dragon” on the latter as the animation director for Elliott the dragon.

But in 1979 Bluth and several other animators solemnly decided to abandon the studio. Given the direction the operation was taking after its creator’s death in 1966 according to Bluth they saw no other way to keep the art of animation alive and thriving. At the time the company was working on one of its biggest disappointments “The Black Cauldron.”

“Someone asked me one time ‘Why did you leave Walt Disney Studios?’ And I said ‘Because Walt left Walt Disney Studios.’ I began to see that the magic he had created was crumbling. It became a corporation with lots of stockholders” Bluth said. “I read that Walt said once ‘The worst thing I ever did was go public.' Suddenly you don't have autonomy anymore. You're beholden to the stockholders who really only want profits.”

The road to 'NIMH'

On their own now Bluth and about 17 others — including his most loyal collaborator Gary Goldman with whom he co-directed many of his features — taught themselves how to put a film together. They were animators learning to become storytellers and filmmakers. Their initial efforts to push animation forward which had started in Bluth's garage before their formal resignation from Disney resulted in the short film “Banjo the Woodpile Cat.”

That calling card earned them the resources to make “The Secret of NIMH.” Bluth’s first animated feature as director was adapted from the book “Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH” under a newly formed studio Don Bluth Productions — which changed names multiple times over the years.

“The cost to make ‘The Secret of NIMH’ hand-drawn was $6.5 million” he said. “Not $150 million not $300 million like today.”

Released during the emblematic summer of 1982 when “E.T. the Extra‑Terrestrial” “Tron” and “Blade Runner” also debuted “The Secret of NIMH” followed the desperate plight of a mother Mrs. Brisby (voiced by Elizabeth Hartman) to save her children from imminent death. She enlists the help from rats who were subjects of scientific testing.

“Those rats became intelligent and with intelligence comes moral values” Bluth said. “You can't just go on being immoral if you've got intelligence in your head there's no wisdom in that. It seemed like a delightful story and there's a lot of conflict in it.”

With mature themes and impeccable craft the film received critical praise but underperformed at the box office. More than a decade later a follow-up to the same narrative was produced without Bluth’s involvement.

“What I really lament is that I would love to have done the sequel to ‘NIMH’ but they said ‘No it's ours now. We'll do it.’ And it was not very good” Bluth added.

'The Land Before Time'

Eager for new projects Bluth took on “Dragon’s Lair” a revolutionary video game for which they animated the entirety of the playable narrative as if it were a film followed by a deal with Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Entertainment that yielded two features: “An American Tail” (1986) about a family of Russian Jewish mice coming to the U.S. and “The Land Before Time” (1988).

The latter a fan favorite is a prehistoric family adventure about a group of young dinosaurs led by Littlefoot (voice by Gabriel Damon) searching for their families after they have migrated to a new region. Aware of the love for the film but still self-critical Bluth believes the concept itself worked better than the finished product.

“To me the story is more grand and more glorious than the animation. Although I think the animation was very difficult” he said about “Land.” He has not seen any of the more than a dozen sequels that were made viewing them as another example of greed tainting the creative process in animation by mass-producing instead of handcrafting singular works.

It was during production on “Land” that Bluth and company resettled their studio in Dublin where he completed a handful of features over a short period of time beginning in 1989: “All Dogs Go to Heaven” the live-action/animation hybrid “Rock-a-Doodle” “Thumbelina” “A Troll in Central Park” and “The Pebble and the Penguin.”

Pleased with the body of work he was able to amass after leaving the House of Mouse Bluth harbors no hard feelings. But obviously he noticed the studio's habit of rereleasing some of its most beloved titles to compete with and diminish the release of Bluth’s original features.

Many years after the 1979 exodus while Bluth was set up in Ireland Roy E. Disney the nephew of his hero now in power presented him with a way back into the flock. He called Bluth and flew to meet him at a pub. Disney extended the type of offer he expected no one could ever refuse.

“He said ‘I want you to come back to the studio. All is forgiven. We'll make it up to you.’ And I said ‘Well Roy I have 360 employees here. They all brought their families here to Ireland.’ And he says ‘You can't win this Don. We'll crush you.’” To that less than subtle threat Bluth replied “Maybe you need us. If we keep trying to compete with you what might happen is you will work harder to make your pictures better.”

“It was always a game of getting the money” Bluth recalled. “But what's phenomenal is that we made 11 full-length animated films before the Disney machinery was able to throw sand in our machine.”

'Anastasia' and 'Titan A.E.'

Bluth’s Ireland chapter concluded when Bill Mechanic then CEO of Fox Filmed Entertainment proposed that he and his team relocate to Phoenix and establish Fox Animation Studios. Their first venture “Anastasia” (1997) a dazzling musical about the lost heir of the Romanov family in czarist Russia became the biggest box office success of Bluth’s career grossing $140 million worldwide.

The filmmaker's most indelible memories of the production include hiring artists from the Philippines due to a wage war between Disney and DreamWorks that created a shortage of stateside talent; passing on Johnny Depp for the role of Dimitri because the actor wanted the character to look like him; shooting an entire live-action iteration of the film with theater actors and the use of digital technologies to enhance key sequences like the “Once Upon a December” number.

In an ironic twist of fate “Anastasia” became one of the titles now owned by Disney after the acquisition of the 21st Century Fox Company in March 2019. Bluth took the news with humor and believes that his creation will endure the change of ownership for the better.

“As long as people see it and enjoy the story and it enriches their lives I'm okay with that. I know that a movie needs to be taken care of and I think Disney will do that very well” he said. “Now if they start marketing her as just another Disney princess I should probably frown a little but I think it's in good hands right now.”

About his last feature film to date the action sci-fi 2D/CG hybrid “Titan A.E.” (2000) a troubled endeavor from the onset that effectively ended Fox Animation Studio Bluth admits that it wasn’t the right fit for him. Yet even within the constraints of a task imposed by the studio higher-ups he approached it with the sincerest intention of making it as good as it could possibly be.

“It was like if a guy fell from the trapeze and someone said to me ‘Don I know you're not used to the trapeze but go up there and just swing about you'll be okay.’ [Laugh]. It was sort of me doing something that wasn't really in my DNA” Bluth said. “I tried as much as I could to make it beautiful to look at but the concept was more of a live action picture than it was an animated story.”

In the years since the “Titan A.E.” ordeal Bluth turned to teaching via Don Bluth University an online school as his way to pass on the artistic wisdom he acquired along 40 intense years in the industry. A hardliner of traditionally hand-drawn animation he hopes to preserve the discipline he adores through education.

“In hand-drawn animation you're the animator called upon to create the figure the actor the character simply with a pencil and an eraser” Bluth explained. “Now over in CG that character is a puppet inside the computer. What you're called upon to do is puppeteering. Animation means to bring to life so I suppose they're bringing something to life but it's not that great feeling that comes from creating life with your pencil.”

Asked if he could identify any themes that followed him throughout the many stories he told in animation Bluth immediately knew what the connecting thread always was.

“Every movie that I've ever made if you look at it closely is about going home. Those are thematic things that seem to push their way inevitably into all my movies” Bluth said. “Home isn't necessarily the soil that you walk on but where your spirit can breathe where your loved ones are. It's where all your memories are. It's something that's very dear.”

It’s not often you’ll find a new island but that’s precisely what those familiar with West Palm Beach will find. It’s been built up for animals and marine life to thrive on.

While one group of volunteers would typically be hard at work for Carrier Global Corporation they paused recently to help plant 1000 mangroves.

It’s fun that Recalde said has meaning behind it.

Palm Beach County and The Nature Conservancy collaborated by building a tiny remnant island to an acre.

""We have a number of what we call interventions"" said Joseph Schmidt climate project manager with The Nature Conservancy. ""We've got some breakwaters. We've got some areas for oyster reefs and we've got an intertidal mangrove flat that we're planting today with volunteers from the carrier corporation.""

An elevated bird nesting island was also created.

Despite his profound admiration for Disney’s storytelling prowess Bluth never aimed to imitate him. “Everyone kept saying ‘I'm going to be the next Walt Disney'” he recalled of some of his colleagues. But he was convinced that if their motivation was strictly financial and not guided by a strong work ethic and spirituality they would fail.

“I didn't want to be Walt. There was only one of those and I'm me. I liked the medium that he worked in and I wanted to see if I could work in it and be successful” Bluth said.

For 20 years Bluth worked on a variety of Disney projects including “The Sword in the Stone” “Robin Hood” “The Rescuers” and “Pete's Dragon” on the latter as the animation director for Elliott the dragon.

But in 1979 Bluth and several other animators solemnly decided to abandon the studio. Given the direction the operation was taking after its creator’s death in 1966 according to Bluth they saw no other way to keep the art of animation alive and thriving. At the time the company was working on one of its biggest disappointments “The Black Cauldron.”

“Someone asked me one time ‘Why did you leave Walt Disney Studios?’ And I said ‘Because Walt left Walt Disney Studios.’ I began to see that the magic he had created was crumbling. It became a corporation with lots of stockholders” Bluth said. “I read that Walt said once ‘The worst thing I ever did was go public.' Suddenly you don't have autonomy anymore. You're beholden to the stockholders who really only want profits.”

The road to 'NIMH'

On their own now Bluth and about 17 others — including his most loyal collaborator Gary Goldman with whom he co-directed many of his features — taught themselves how to put a film together. They were animators learning to become storytellers and filmmakers. Their initial efforts to push animation forward which had started in Bluth's garage before their formal resignation from Disney resulted in the short film “Banjo the Woodpile Cat.”

That calling card earned them the resources to make “The Secret of NIMH.” Bluth’s first animated feature as director was adapted from the book “Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH” under a newly formed studio Don Bluth Productions — which changed names multiple times over the years.

“The cost to make ‘The Secret of NIMH’ hand-drawn was $6.5 million” he said. “Not $150 million not $300 million like today.”

Released during the emblematic summer of 1982 when “E.T. the Extra‑Terrestrial” “Tron” and “Blade Runner” also debuted “The Secret of NIMH” followed the desperate plight of a mother Mrs. Brisby (voiced by Elizabeth Hartman) to save her children from imminent death. She enlists the help from rats who were subjects of scientific testing.

“Those rats became intelligent and with intelligence comes moral values” Bluth said. “You can't just go on being immoral if you've got intelligence in your head there's no wisdom in that. It seemed like a delightful story and there's a lot of conflict in it.”

With mature themes and impeccable craft the film received critical praise but underperformed at the box office. More than a decade later a follow-up to the same narrative was produced without Bluth’s involvement.

“What I really lament is that I would love to have done the sequel to ‘NIMH’ but they said ‘No it's ours now. We'll do it.’ And it was not very good” Bluth added.

'The Land Before Time'

Eager for new projects Bluth took on “Dragon’s Lair” a revolutionary video game for which they animated the entirety of the playable narrative as if it were a film followed by a deal with Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Entertainment that yielded two features: “An American Tail” (1986) about a family of Russian Jewish mice coming to the U.S. and “The Land Before Time” (1988).

The latter a fan favorite is a prehistoric family adventure about a group of young dinosaurs led by Littlefoot (voice by Gabriel Damon) searching for their families after they have migrated to a new region. Aware of the love for the film but still self-critical Bluth believes the concept itself worked better than the finished product.

“To me the story is more grand and more glorious than the animation. Although I think the animation was very difficult” he said about “Land.” He has not seen any of the more than a dozen sequels that were made viewing them as another example of greed tainting the creative process in animation by mass-producing instead of handcrafting singular works.

It was during production on “Land” that Bluth and company resettled their studio in Dublin where he completed a handful of features over a short period of time beginning in 1989: “All Dogs Go to Heaven” the live-action/animation hybrid “Rock-a-Doodle” “Thumbelina” “A Troll in Central Park” and “The Pebble and the Penguin.”

Pleased with the body of work he was able to amass after leaving the House of Mouse Bluth harbors no hard feelings. But obviously he noticed the studio's habit of rereleasing some of its most beloved titles to compete with and diminish the release of Bluth’s original features.

Many years after the 1979 exodus while Bluth was set up in Ireland Roy E. Disney the nephew of his hero now in power presented him with a way back into the flock. He called Bluth and flew to meet him at a pub. Disney extended the type of offer he expected no one could ever refuse.

“He said ‘I want you to come back to the studio. All is forgiven. We'll make it up to you.’ And I said ‘Well Roy I have 360 employees here. They all brought their families here to Ireland.’ And he says ‘You can't win this Don. We'll crush you.’” To that less than subtle threat Bluth replied “Maybe you need us. If we keep trying to compete with you what might happen is you will work harder to make your pictures better.”

“It was always a game of getting the money” Bluth recalled. “But what's phenomenal is that we made 11 full-length animated films before the Disney machinery was able to throw sand in our machine.”

'Anastasia' and 'Titan A.E.'

Bluth’s Ireland chapter concluded when Bill Mechanic then CEO of Fox Filmed Entertainment proposed that he and his team relocate to Phoenix and establish Fox Animation Studios. Their first venture “Anastasia” (1997) a dazzling musical about the lost heir of the Romanov family in czarist Russia became the biggest box office success of Bluth’s career grossing $140 million worldwide.

The filmmaker's most indelible memories of the production include hiring artists from the Philippines due to a wage war between Disney and DreamWorks that created a shortage of stateside talent; passing on Johnny Depp for the role of Dimitri because the actor wanted the character to look like him; shooting an entire live-action iteration of the film with theater actors and the use of digital technologies to enhance key sequences like the “Once Upon a December” number.

In an ironic twist of fate “Anastasia” became one of the titles now owned by Disney after the acquisition of the 21st Century Fox Company in March 2019. Bluth took the news with humor and believes that his creation will endure the change of ownership for the better.

“As long as people see it and enjoy the story and it enriches their lives I'm okay with that. I know that a movie needs to be taken care of and I think Disney will do that very well” he said. “Now if they start marketing her as just another Disney princess I should probably frown a little but I think it's in good hands right now.”

About his last feature film to date the action sci-fi 2D/CG hybrid “Titan A.E.” (2000) a troubled endeavor from the onset that effectively ended Fox Animation Studio Bluth admits that it wasn’t the right fit for him. Yet even within the constraints of a task imposed by the studio higher-ups he approached it with the sincerest intention of making it as good as it could possibly be.

“It was like if a guy fell from the trapeze and someone said to me ‘Don I know you're not used to the trapeze but go up there and just swing about you'll be okay.’ [Laugh]. It was sort of me doing something that wasn't really in my DNA” Bluth said. “I tried as much as I could to make it beautiful to look at but the concept was more of a live action picture than it was an animated story.”

In the years since the “Titan A.E.” ordeal Bluth turned to teaching via Don Bluth University an online school as his way to pass on the artistic wisdom he acquired along 40 intense years in the industry. A hardliner of traditionally hand-drawn animation he hopes to preserve the discipline he adores through education.

“In hand-drawn animation you're the animator called upon to create the figure the actor the character simply with a pencil and an eraser” Bluth explained. “Now over in CG that character is a puppet inside the computer. What you're called upon to do is puppeteering. Animation means to bring to life so I suppose they're bringing something to life but it's not that great feeling that comes from creating life with your pencil.”

Asked if he could identify any themes that followed him throughout the many stories he told in animation Bluth immediately knew what the connecting thread always was.

“Every movie that I've ever made if you look at it closely is about going home. Those are thematic things that seem to push their way inevitably into all my movies” Bluth said. “Home isn't necessarily the soil that you walk on but where your spirit can breathe where your loved ones are. It's where all your memories are. It's something that's very dear.”

ESG AND ESG Data

ESG investing is a type of investing that takes into account environmental social and governance issues. ESG refers to the three pillars of sustainable development: environmental protection social responsibility and good governance.

ESG investing has become increasingly popular in recent years as more investors are looking to put their money into companies that are making a positive impact on the world.

ESG data is a set of environmental social and governance indicators that can be used to assess the sustainability of a company or investment.

ESG data can be used to screen for companies that are leaders in sustainability identify companies with ESG risks and track ESG performance over time.

ESG data is also becoming increasingly important to investors as they seek to align their investments with their values.

As more and more investors focus on ESG factors the demand for ESG data will continue to grow.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL21pb3RlY2gtc3RyZW5ndGhlbnMtcmVnaW9uYWwtYW5kLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtbGVhZGVyc2hpcC13aXRoLWFwcG9pbnRtZW50LW9mLWV4LW1zY2lzLWphY2stbGluLTMwMTYwOTY1MC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MioTech Strengthens Regional and International Leadership with Appointment of ex-MSCI's Jack Lin,"HONG KONG Aug. 21 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- MioTech the AI-based sustainability data and technology provider announced today the appointment of finance veteran Jack Lin as President effective immediately.

This article explains how to use the free Garmin Connect Course Creator tool to map cycling and running routes online and then export them to your Garmin sports GPS device.



Getting Started

To begin using Course Creator start a free account at Garmin Connect if you don't already have one. You will make the best use of Garmin Connect and Course Creator if you also own a Garmin sports GPS device but you don't need one to create and share courses online.

Access the Garmin Account Sign In page and select Create One under the form. Enter your name and email address choose a password for your account and then select Create Account.

Once you're logged in you can access the full website and begin making a course.

Fred Zahradnik

From the left-hand menu open Training and then Courses to launch the Courses page. Choose Create a Course to open the Select a Course Type window. Pick a course type from the dropdown menu. Your options include Running Hiking Road Cycling and several others. Pick Custom as the Drawing Method and then hit Continue. Another option is called Round Trip which is an easy way to quickly build a course that has a particular distance. However the following steps are for making a custom course not a round trip course. Select the map to make a starting point or use the Location search bar at the top of that page to start somewhere that isn't nearby. You can zoom very close to the map so be sure to utilize that ability to make sure you're selecting the correct roads and paths that you want included in your course. Select the map again to make another course point and keep doing that until you're finished building the course. The Course Creator tool will display total mileage in real time as you create the path. Note the options on the left side of the map. You can have your course points follow popularity routing or roads or you can even make the course follow your every move with the Freehand option which will create direct lines from each of your course points. If you wish to do a loop route click your way to the last point you want to be sure to hit and then select Loop to Start to finish it out. There's more on these options below. Name your course with the pencil icon and then select Save New Course.

Course Types

The Course Creator tool does a good job of tracking roads when you have the Follow Roads option enabled. If you pick Freehand for a truly custom course make sure to watch closely at where you're clicking; the line between each selection is straight and doesn't factor in buildings or yards.

If you wish to plan out a course where you go to the ending point and then return to the starting point following the exact same path you can do that too. Just map out the path and then choose Out and Back from the left pane in the map.

Editing any course is as easy as clicking and dragging intermediate points. For example if you want to move your course south by a few blocks find the line that is too far and drag the blue point down a few streets. The rest of the course will auto-adjust to make it work.

Sharing and Exporting Your Course

When you've built and saved your course it appears in your courses list accessible through the Training menu as described above. When you open a course you can keep it private or use the Make Public link to share it.

Sharing a Garmin Connect course is as easy as sharing the URL. Copy the link in your browser and share it with anyone so that they can view the course details like the distance map points elevation etc. They can also download your map in the GPX or FIT file format.

Keep in mind that when you share a course anyone with the link can see exactly where the course begins and ends something you might not want to share if the course includes your home address.

One of the neatest tricks of Course Creator is the ability to export your course to your Garmin GPS device. Simply connect your Garmin to your computer via its included USB cable and then select Send to Device. This works only if you have Garmin Express installed.

About the Garmin Connect Service

If you're an active cyclist or runner you've probably at least dabbled with online mileage and training logs. These online services add tremendous value to your training information. When used with data uploaded from a sports GPS device they take virtually all of the tedium out of capturing storing and analyzing training data.

Complementing online training logs have been services such as Map My Ride which provide utilities that let you map measure and pre-plan routes.

Garmin has successfully combined the features of online training logs and online route planning and mapping services in its free Garmin Connect service. The route planning and mapping feature specifically is called Course Creator. With Course Creator you can also export a route file to your Garmin GPS device.

The export feature is terrific if you want to pre-map a new route in a new location. A mapping GPS such as the Garmin Edge 800 can provide you with turn-by-turn directions from a pre-loaded route.

Is there a difference? And does it matter when you're using your bike computer or smartwatch?

While most of us now take using technology to record a bike ride for granted there's some extremely clever science helping our devices know where we are where we want to get to and how long it will take us to get there – and that science is changing and improving every day.

All the best cycling computers and best smartwatches for cycling use global satellite systems to pinpoint our location but whilst we routinely describe the tech as GPS it is GNSS that's actually the correct naming convention.

But what is GPS? Who operates the system? Is it better than GNSS? And how does all this satellite magic work anyway? Read on to get a crash course in satellite navigation in this expert GPS vs GNSS guide.

GPS vs GNSS: what’s the difference?

What is GPS? “GPS stands for ‘Global Positioning System’’ and is the name for just one of the many satellite operating systems that criss-cross the earth's orbit” says Rich Robinson head of UK product at Garmin. “It’s owned and operated by the very cool-sounding United States Space Force.”

That’s GPS sorted. So what is GNSS? ”GNSS or ‘Global Navigation Satellite System’ is the generic term that describes all of the satellite systems that are owned by nations and governing bodies across the globe.

""I always think of the 'Hoover' analogy when describing GPS and GNSS” he adds. “Hoover became synonymous with vacuum cleaners as one of the original brands. The same with GPS. It was the first global navigation satellite systems but now it’s one of a handful of systems in operation.”

How does GNSS work on my bike computer and smartwatch?

Light travels at the incomprehensibly fast speed of 300000 km/s (186000 miles/s) –and so do the radio waves from a satellite.

While this seems instantaneous to human brains there’s actually a time lag as information is sent from around 11000 miles overhead. This time lag can be measured by your GPS/GNSS device.

In his book Zoom author Bob Berman describes how this is factored in to calculating your exact position on the ground:

“A GPS satellite contains an automatic clock that send out time signals"" he writes. “The receiver recognises that it's the wrong time. Wrong because the signal travelling at light speed required one-twentieth of a second to arrive.

""Your GPS which knows the right time instantly calculates how far the satellite must be for the signal to have been delayed for exactly that amount of time. It does this with three or four satellites and thus triangulates where your position must be. All by using the known speed of light.”

Do GPS and other GNSS systems work the same way?

“Fundamentally all satellite systems operate the same way” says Dean Thomas position navigation and time consultant to the UK Space Agency. “It’s the number of satellites in operation and the number of frequencies that are different.”

“It's important to remember the basics when thinking about how a receiver like a bike computer works” he adds. “Each satellite network uses different space planes and slots depending on the number of satellites that make up the system which is known as a constellation.

“Each GNSS use orbital planes surrounding Earth in the Medium Earth Orbit this is because it's considered the best place for lots of factors including getting the most coverage of earth for the fewest number of satellites.

""Take GPS. Its satellites are positioned in six equally-spaced planes and each plane plane contains four 'slots' occupied by baseline satellites. This 24-slot arrangement ensures users can view at least four satellites from virtually any point on the planet.

""Some receivers like your bike computers will use a dual- or tri-[band] operating system such as GPS GLONASS and Galileo. This provides more accuracy than just GPS alone especially in the more remote parts of the world or where densely built up urban areas or tree cover can block or reflect a signal.

""Having dual frequency will make a big impact” Thomas continues “as it's where you get even more granular information closer to that one-metre accuracy.

""Satellites transmit several different frequencies. There are military signals which of course are restricted and closed but consumer devices like a bike computer will depending on satellites they are receiving from use two L1 and L5 frequencies. These will give you much better accuracy in positioning.

“It's currently only GPS that has the technology that will allow the dual-frequency system. Other GNSS will eventually operate on this dual-band system but it will take a while for them to be replaced with that functionality.

“Tracking and mapping devices that can use both multi-band and multi-GNSS are significantly improved from ones that don't” Thomas explains.

“Receivers that do both are able to detect and reject rogue signals. This means that in dense urban areas or where there is a lot of tree cover the two frequencies working together have a much stronger chance of ensuring that you receive the correct information as to your location.”

""Although your accuracy of location will depend on the strength of your processor and mapping capabilities. This is why your mobile phone is one of the most accurate location detectors as phone companies have been using the technology for a long time. It’s only now that other devices such as bike computers are catching up as the technology becomes cheaper and more readily available.”

Which satellite system is which? (Image credit: GettyImages)

Who owns the GPS and GNSS satellite systems?

Declared operational in 1995 GPS is the name for the USA’s state-owned satellites and is committed to maintaining at least 24 operational satellites 95 percent of the time. In order to deliver this the US Space Force has been flying 31 operational GPS satellites for over a decade. (According to the official GPS website as of 26 June 2022 there are 26 operational satellites in the constellation – “not including decommissioned on-orbit spares”.

“In reality there are four satellite constellations that are used on a daily basis” says Mark Bacon head of space security at the UK Space Agency. ""These are GPS GLONASS Galileo and BeiDou. Consumers can access these with their receiving device for free and typically get an accurate geolocation pin of between one to three metres depending on how many constellations and frequencies their device can process.”

There are several other global navigation satellite systems in operation that you may have heard of. According to Bacon however most won't really be a factor when using your bike computer.

Here's a breakdown of the full global navigation satellite systems and who owns them:

GPS (Global Positioning System): 26 satellites owned and operated by the US government

26 satellites owned and operated by the US government BDS (BeiDou Navigation Satellite System): 35 satellites owned and operated by China (previously known as Compass)

35 satellites owned and operated by China (previously known as Compass) Galileo: 24+ satellites operated by the European Union

24+ satellites operated by the European Union GLONASS (Globalnaya Navigazionnaya Sputnikovaya Sistema): 24+ satellites owned and operated by the Russian Federation

24+ satellites owned and operated by the Russian Federation IRNSS / NavIC (Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System / Navigation India Constellation): Seven satellites owned and operated by the government of India.

Seven satellites owned and operated by the government of India. QZSS (Quasi-Zenith Satellite System): Four operational satellites expanding to seven by 2023. Owned by the government of Japan operated by QZS System Service Inc

""At the moment most other constellations augment the three main ones” says Bacon. “Some systems are still in their infancy like QZSS [which is] owned by the Japanese Government [and] is really a tag on to GPS. It has been positioned to specifically support dense urban cities in Japan such as Tokyo which can be really affected by the urban canyon issue"". (An 'urban canyon' is a city street flanked by tall buildings which can block satellite signal just as a mountain might in a rural environment.)

“GPS is the most prevalent satellite system and can be ‘seen' by a receiver such as your bike computer smartwatch or smartphone almost anywhere in the world. But in theory you could have a bike computer that worked solely on GLONASS or Galileo satellites if you wanted although people would probably still call it a GPS unit"".

Privately owned constellations

There are also now a significant and ever increasing number of privately owned satellite fleets. Some of these such as the Iridium satellite network offer users a more interactive service with functions like third-person tracking location sharing and two-way emergency SOS messaging without a phone signal – as well as satellite phones.

The key difference between government and privately owned satellite systems is that the former are freely available to all users worldwide to provide positioning navigation and timing services globally. The more integrative systems often require a user subscription before you can take advantage of their services.

Even if you have a multi-GNSS and multi-frequency unit that doesn't mean that your accuracy is going to be military grade.

“Remember when bike computers or data tracking watches first came out? You could spot the early adopters a mile off as they were standing still on a race start line trying to pick up a satellite signal” says Garmin’s Rich Robinson.

“That was because you were literally waiting for a satellite to move into a position that you could receive a signal. Thankfully on the more recent navigation devices that use more than one GNSS it will be able to call upon any satellite system in order to receive the swiftest pick-up. If it is a GPS (which in all likelihood it will be due to its prevalence) and you have multi-band frequency too you'll get the most accurate data.

“It used to be a thing that the more GNSS your receiver was able to process the quicker your battery would drain. That's a real myth these days for 99.9% of the population and it's more likely to be a bigger processor (which is busy turning the signal in to usable data) that has a bigger impact on the unit’s battery life.”

“The accuracy you get still depends on your mapping” Robinson adds. “GPS likes straight lines. When it comes to plotting a route unless you go plotting mad and put in a pin on every single bend or turn – which will make your device slower as it's storing all that information – you'll just get straight lines from when you last picked up a signal.

""This can be made even worse if your device is set in a power saving mode tracking a signal every couple of minutes. You might find yourself wildly out of position or if you are recording your route over or under on distance or altitude.

""This isn't a huge issue on the open road but in cities or off-road riding with lots of twists and turns this can lead to you getting completely lost.

“The more processing power your device has the more likely that it will use something called a SmartData algorithm that irons out straight lines into a more realistic route especially if it’s been ridden before using the same platform as it can use the information to get more accuracy from analysing multiple similar datasets and draw a more accurate picture.

""Of course that level of information requires a lot of processing up to 60 times that of a device that doesn't have the same accuracy which is super-power hungry. This is why batteries need to be so good these days just to support the technology that is available.”

Why can’t I get a decent satellite signal?

You've got the multi-GNSS multi-band SmartData tracking huge processor and immense battery reserves but you still can't pick up a signal. What's up with that?

""Assuming your all-singing receiving device is actually working properly and you are in the northern hemisphere there’s really only signal-jamming that would impact on consumers"" says Thomas of the UK Space Agency.

“Never say never in regards to the owner of a satellite system suddenly not allowing consumers to use its network but on the bases that no classified information will ever be used on that system there’s no reason to switch off broadcasting.

“If you find yourself in certain vicinities and there seems to be a blanket no signal you may find that it's high level military signal jamming. This is high power and will create a signal black hole for miles around. It’s highly unlikely that it will impact your regular bike computer or fitness trainer but it can happen.

Here at Cycling Weekly we were easily able to find when GPS jamming exercises were taking place so worth checking in advance if you are planning a ride need military bases.

Thomas reassures us that ""there certainly isn't a cause for concern that you are being tracked by a satellite system operator – no one at that level wants to know where you are riding your bike.

""Someone's boss on the other had might. Although illegal in most countries privacy jammers that block satellite signals can block the signal for your receiver too. They are used to shield location detectors that are often fitted to work vans so if you scratching your head wondering why you can’t get a signal on a good day in open terrain check you’re not standing next to a white trades van especially if the driver is having a nap.

“Unfortunately similar systems are becoming more popular in vehicle theft with the culprits fixing a GNSS signal jammer to a stolen car abandoning it while it's still hot before returning to it a few days later. Again if you are in a signal black hole this could be why.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNndWlkZS5jb20vbmV3cy9pLWp1c3QtdHJpZWQtYXBwbGUtd2F0Y2gtd2l0aC1zd2luZ3Zpc2lvbi1mb3ItdGVubmlzLWhlcmVzLXdoYXQtaGFwcGVuZWTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I just tried Apple Watch SwingVision to up my tennis game — here's what happened,"If you know how to use the Apple Watch you might know it’s great for tracking basic walks or runs but it’s also capable of tracking a wide variety of workout and sport types. In my case those workout types are often inspiration to try activities I wouldn’t do otherwise.

Take tennis for example. I played some tennis as a teenager and even took a few lessons to learn the game. It didn’t stick at the time but I’ve recently rediscovered an interest after reading about how tennis is one of those “lifelong” sports you can play for decades like golf. And after seeing my Apple Watch has a designed preset for tracking tennis in the workout app the promise of closing my Apple Watch rings motivated me to hit my local court.

It’s one thing to play tennis in Switch Sports on my Nintendo Switch. Clutching the worn grip of my old racket in my hand while bouncing a fresh-out-of-the-can tennis ball on concrete is something else entirely. It’s something that felt soothing at first then a bit spunky as I started moving around the court for a volley with my dad.

Tracking tennis with Apple Watch

The workout app in watchOS 9 has been redesigned but the Apple Watch has been able to track tennis for several years. It doesn’t have auto-tracking like walking running or outdoor cycling so I had to locate and launch the workout among all the choices on my wrist (though I could’ve also asked Siri to start a tennis workout.)

As is the case for a majority of workout types the Apple Watch Series 7 on my wrist monitored my heart rate calories burned and time elapsed for tennis. Again these are the same metrics I saw when I tried wearing my Apple Watch for hot yoga and went paddleboarding with my Apple Watch.

It took a bit for me to remember the rhythm of the game and refine my form. But eventually I picked up my pace around the court as reflected by my heart rate. I kept my Apple Watch on my left wrist where I normally wear it so it didn’t get in the way of my right-handed serves or forearm shots. Though as one of the best smartwatches for sports it sits flush enough to my wrist that it didn’t interfere with backhand swings either. Meanwhile the form-fitting Solo Loop one of the best Apple Watch bands kept the device secure to my wrist.

By the time I tired out I had burned almost 200 calories making a major dent in my activity rings. I also walked home from the court clear-minded feeling like the movement offered a sort of meditation I might find in Apple Fitness Plus or in the Headspace app I’ve started using recently.

SwingVision for Apple Watch

(Image credit: Future)

If you’re looking to take your tennis game to the next level you might want to know about SwingVision. As one of the best Apple Watch apps for sports (it was even featured in an Apple Watch ad) SwingVision leverages AI as well as the technology in Apple devices to create comprehensive reports of how you play.

I had the opportunity to try out SwingVision with representatives from the company incorporating a demo of the technology with a short tennis lesson. The program required two devices for data collection: an iPad Pro overlooking the court from a very tall tripod and the Apple Watch on my wrist. But unlike playing tennis on my own I had to switch my watch to my right hand for accurate swing analysis.

During the lesson the SwingVision app on my wrist tracked my heart rate calories distance moved and number of shots. And after each individual shot I could see specific details about my swing. Based on the movement of my wrist SwingVision identified what kind of shot I made how fast I hit the ball and the rotational speed of the ball. It quickly became a game for me to swing as fast as possible while keeping my shots in play.

For close calls at the lines the iPad Pro’s recording could review the play thanks to the device’s 12MP Ultra Wide camera. Then after the session we looked at the data collected by the iPad Pro to see how I fared.

The SwingVision AI can filter every shot from the session based on what kind of swing I made and whether the shot was in or out. It can display the data on the graphic map of the court as well as create video highlight reels — or lowlight reels if you’re looking to work on trouble areas. The data and videos are then easily shareable with a coach or parent.

Should you try SwingVision?

As someone who loves sports stats SwingVision delivers all the juicy data I want to know. Regrettably becoming the next Serena Williams isn’t in the cards for me so I don’t know what this data will help me.

Still the free-tier of SwingVision supports up to two hours of shot tracking video analysis and cloud storage per month. That’s probably more time than I’ll get to play on a monthly basis making it a no-brainer to keep using the app for shot tracking from my wrist. I mean how else will I know whether I’m getting better at slices?

I don’t think I’ll use it with an iPad Pro mostly because I don’t own an iPad Pro and because it does require set-up before playing. SwingVision sells a fence mount that’s supposed to take some of the hassle out of getting a session started but again I’m comfortable in the “casual player” category.

That’s not to say I don’t see the value in the full experience. In fact it’s great to see in-depth sport data democratized in a way anyone can work on their game. Apparently the only way to get the type of data formulated by SwingVision a few years ago was with a $10000 system installed on Pro-only courts. Now with a $149.99/year SwingVision subscription any player and any coach have access to highly-advanced tennis data with the help of some Apple devices.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVzY2llbmNlLmNvbS9maXRiaXQtc2Vuc2UtdnMtZml0Yml0LXZlcnNhLTPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fitbit Sense vs Fitbit Versa 3: Which is better?,"When picking the best Fitbit it’s fair to ask “should I buy the Fitbit Sense vs the Fitbit Versa 3?” The models are remarkably similar although there are some key differences under the surface.

While Fitbit made its name with more bracelet-styled fitness trackers the Versa 3 and Sense show the manufacturer embracing a smartwatch-like design. They are both easily among the best fitness trackers you can buy right now and also feature in our round-up of the best Fitbits.

That said they’re not quite on the same level as the likes of the best Garmin watches or the Apple Watch Series 7 – the interface on Fitbits is still app-based and there are very limited third-party connections on the watches. But what the models lack in fancy features they make up for with a low price and long battery life.

So without further ado here’s a thorough breakdown of the Fitbit Sense vs Fitbit Versa 3 – which will come out on top?

Which is cheaper?

Both the Fitbit Sense and the Versa 3 are perched atop the Fitbit pyramid in terms of features so they represent the most premium models available from the company.

The Fitbit Versa 3 comes in at $229.95 although it can be found retailing for around $80 less if you do some digging. Meanwhile the Fitbit Sense will set you back $299.95 but again you can find it for considerably less (we recently spotted it on sale for $219.)

Which is more accurate?

In our testing across a variety of workouts both the Sense and the Versa 3 were equally as accurate.

Since both offer GPS we were able to run without having a phone connected. Both picked up our location within seconds and both tracked steps and distance within just a few metres of each other. It’d be fair to say that a dedicated running watch (like the Garmin Forerunner 255) would be more accurate but it would also be a lot more expensive.

Both also have water resistance and in testing with a pool swim both tracked lengths consistently with no issues with functionality (although operating a touchscreen device with wet hands is a challenge on both models).

Which looks better?

The Fitbit Sense and the Versa 3 look very similar. Both offer a 1.58-inch OLED screen with color support which is easy to read in sunlight. The bezel around the display is slim too and there are no physical buttons – although there is a touch-sensitive section on one side. The screen is covered in Gorilla Glass to make the entire thing more durable.

If you’re upgrading from a smaller Fitbit Inspire 2 you may be surprised at how big it is. The Versa 3 weighs in at 27.21g while the Sense is slightly heavier at 31.75g. When testing them out we found this difference to be negligible.

They both offer swappable straps which clip on and off with ease and whichever one you opt for they come with no metallic moving pieces. The idea is that this helps the “Infinity Band” last longer.

So what is different? Aside from the slight difference in weight the only indicator of whether you have a Fitbit Sense or Versa 3 in your hands is the color option. The Sense comes in soft gold silver stainless steel and graphite stainless steel.

The Versa 3 is a little more varied with four options; black gold (with midnight blue strap) gold (with pink strap) and thistle (essentially gold with a purple/gray strap).

The two are so similar though that it’ll come down to personal preference.

Which model offers more features?

The Fitbit Sense has two sensors above what’s offered by the Fitbit Versa 3: the EDA and ECG scans.

The former in basic terms tracks the electromagnetic current of your skin which is affected by active sweat secretion. This is influenced by your nervous system so in theory the higher the reading the higher your stress levels. To get a reading you simply place your palm over the screen of the device and wait.

An ECG is a way of identifying atrial fibrillation also known as an irregular heartbeat. While it’s fairly rare to find EDA sensors in wearables ECG sensors are common across other devices. Neither of these features are available on the Versa 3.

Aside from the above the two models offer a similar array of tracking features. You can track steps blood oxygen levels heart rate distance calories burned sleep and plenty more on either device with everything feeding back into the excellent Fitbit app so you can read your data at a glance.

Both also include six months of Fitbit Premium an additional subscription that adds personalized training resting and diet options to your Fitbit.

Which is better for tracking workouts?

Both Fitbit models allow for plenty of workout types with over twenty available right out of the box on each.

That means there’s an option for the basics like walking running and cycling as well as more gym-based workouts like weights stairclimbers and circuit training and sports ones like tennis golf and more.

Again there’s nothing to choose from between the two in terms of the number or variety of workouts.

Which has better battery life?

Again it’s a little tough to pick a winner here. Because both share the same chassis with presumably the same battery size (Fitbit doesn’t denote the size of the internal battery) the actual battery life is dependent on which of the features you’re using.

If you’re taking regular ECGs on the Fitbit Sense for example you’ll see the battery life drop lower than the Versa 3 with standard use.

Verdict

Given the fairly slimline differences between the Fitbit Sense and the Fitbit Versa 3 it’d be fair to say the Sense comes out on top in terms of features – the EDA and ECG scans make it the most feature-packed Fitbit around.

That’s perhaps oversimplifying things though – if you’re not looking for either of those features you can save $80 and be just as happy with the Versa 3.

Of course it may just come down to color options particularly if a discount brings the pricing of both models closer together. In any case both the Fitbit Sense and the Fitbit Versa 3 are excellent fitness trackers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZ2FkZ2V0c2FuZHdlYXJhYmxlcy5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8yMC9nYXJtaW4tZm9yZXJ1bm5lci05NTUtYmF0dGVyeS1kcmFpbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Software update fixes Garmin Forerunner 955 battery drain,"5 min read

The latest software beta that goes under number 12.20 fixes one of the main causees of the Garmin Forerunner 955 battery drain problem.

The watch was released alongside the Forerunner 255 back in June. The 955 is perhaps Garmin’s greatest watch yet – at least in terms of ability. It has a few new recovery metrics namely HRV Status and Daily Training Readiness which add a whole new dimension to your training. Granted we are expecting other Garmin devices to inherit this ability namely the Fenix 7 range and Epix 2 – and the features are already in Beta on these devices.

Garmin Forerunner 955 – battery drain

The advertised battery life of the Forerunner 955 is 15 days between charges with typical use or 42 hours in GPS-only mode without music. Of course switch the all-systems GNSS mode on and this comes swiftly down to around 20 hours.

These figures improve slightly on what you can expect on the 945 line. Of course there’s also a solar option of the 955 which (in ideal conditions) adds 5 days to smartwatch mode and 7 hours to GPS-only mode without music.

Essential reading: Garmin Forerunner 955 vs Fenix 7 – comparison feature

But does the device live up to these battery life claims? The answer if you read the Garmin Forums over the past few months is – perhaps not.

There’s a long thread there discussing battery consumption on the device. It seems that some people are experiencing a battery drain issue.

“I have noticed an unexpected battery drain where I am losing about 10% per day even on the days when I’m not using GPS. Glad I’m not the only one.” says one person.

“Also losing a lot. Lost around 10% without any activities over a 12 hour period. No notification etc as those disabled SO2 also off.” another one chimes in.

Granted the forum thread is a mix of people reporting the issue and those saying there are not experiencing a battery drain. So it’s a mixed bag.

I’ve had my Garmin Forerunner 955 since June and am getting battery consumption that is more or less in line with the advertised figures. With all-night SpO2 monitoring switched on it equates to about 5-6% on days that I don’t train. Which is what I would expect.

I would suggest to stick to default watch-faces at the outset. For example it is good to avoid watch-faces such as Titanium which has been reported to be a battery hog. That may be part of the explanation for the poor performance you are seeing. Stick to watch-faces which do not have too many data fields. And avoid using the data fields which require high refresh rates.

Essential reading: Garmin Forerunner 955 vs 255 – which should you get?

You can always do a reset by holding down power button for 30 sec and powering back up. This has been known to clear battery issues with other Garmin devices.

Of course there is an outside chance your Forerunner 955 could be faulty. In which case you should return your device.

Garmin Forerunner 955 battery drain fixed?

In fairness the device hasn’t been around for very long. A battery drain with certain configurations of the watch might be a price you need to pay if you are an early adopter.

The company has had these types of problems before. You just need to go back a couple of months for the most recent occurrence. Firmware update 21.00 for Garmin Fenix 6 brought a bunch of useful features. But for some users it also brought heavy battery consumption.

The good news is that Garmin has found the cause of the problem on the Forerunner 955.

“We believe that we have a fix for this report that will be rolling out with the next software release for this device. While I do not have a timetable for this release I will be updating this thread as information is made available. Thank you for your patience while we work towards a resolution for this report.” one of the Garmin forum moderators wrote a few days ago.

Now the company has released firmware 12.20 which fixes the issue. It is in Beta currently and should reach public release in the weeks ahead.

Early reports are that this does indeed help to rectify the problem. It seems to address the main cause of the battery drain – the post activity behaviour of the watch. Most of the users reported the heaviest battery drain after a run or cycle. Whether the GPS remained connected is not clear but restarting the watch after an activity stopped the battery drain. With Beta 12.20 you no longer need to do this. So a massive improvement.

Part of this update is also SatIQ which is something else that can help to extend battery life. When enabled it will automatically choose the most power-efficient mode for satellite connectivity while not jeopardising accuracy.

Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies

A small primer in case you don’t know what is the Gartner Hype Cycle. Gartner is one of the most respected business analysis companies in the world and every year it releases a graph of the disruptive innovative technologies to keep an eye on: the Hype Cycle. This graph shows what technologies may be disruptive for the short and long-term future and so what technologies big companies should start working with because they could create opportunities for them or disrupt their own business. The graph is called the “Hype Cycle” because it puts the technologies on a curve that highlights the typical reception of a disruptive technology:

At first the technology gets discovered (Innovation Trigger)

(Innovation Trigger) Then everyone starts getting hyped and think that that technology is going to disrupt everything and be useful for everything (Peak of Inflated Expectations)

and think that that technology is going to disrupt everything and be useful for everything (Peak of Inflated Expectations) Then people realize that that technology can’t match the exaggerated expectations set up by the hype so they are disappointed (Trough of disillusionment)

Then the technology evolves and starts finding its real use cases (Slope of Enlightenment)

(Slope of Enlightenment) In the end the technology becomes useful and widely adopted. It is not special anymore but mainstream (Plateau of productivity)

While you read those bullet points probably you have also thought about the story of VR hyped with the DK2 and Facebook’s acquisition of Oculus; rejected as a “fad” when the Rift CV1 and the Vive couldn’t reach the expected sales; started being considered again with the Quest and now it’s quasi-mainstream with kids asking a Quest 2 for Christmas to their parents.

The Hype Cycle gets released every year and is a graph that most business managers consider with great interest: if a technology is put there it means that has a lot of potential for the future.

Gartner Hype Cycle for 2022

Gartner has examined more than 2000 technologies and chose 25 that defined as “must-know innovations to drive competitive differentiation and efficiency”. These 25 special technologies have then been inserted into the hype cycle:

The Gartner Hype Cycle for 2022 (Image by Gartner)

As we can see there are some technologies that we all know: the metaverse web3 NFT and digital humans to name a few. All these technologies are what we are dreaming of for the next 5 to 10 years. Immersive realities are so important for Gartner that it also identified them as one of the macro themes for 2022. The three macro-themes are in fact:

Expand immersive experiences

Accelerate artificial intelligence (AI) automation

Optimize technologist delivery

You can read a bit more on Gartner’s 2022 Hype Cycle in its dedicated release blog post.

Analyzing the chart

It’s not the first time that Gartner puts immersive realities in its hype cycle and also when it happened with AR and VR I agreed on the fact that they should have been in the graph but I didn’t agree with their position. For instance saying that “Metaverse” is just rising now on the hype sounds a bit weird considering that since Zuck’s announcement of Meta at Facebook Connect the web has been filled with posts about the metaverse and all the trillions it may give us. NFTs are reported as having just passed the hype but actually we are now into “the cryptocrash” so in my opinion they are more in the trough of disillusionment. I personally think that all these technologies should be more on the right than where they are but probably Gartner has its own metrics to evaluate this position or maybe it considers these technologies from different standpoints than mine (e.g. from the consumers’ point of view or business owners’ point of view).

Anyway it is super-important that metaverse digital humans web3 and other similar tech have entered this cycle: this means that Gartner validates how they can be disruptive for our future. This will lead to more companies wanting to enter the ecosystem and making investments in our field. It’s a very important endorsement in my opinion which can only bring positive consequences for all of us. I guess that many startups (mine included) will put this graph in their pitch deck.

It is relevant how two of the macro trends are immersive realities and AI. These fields are very connected as NVIDIA managers told me when I spoke with them. AI for instance will lead to the creation of smart interfaces for our AR glasses which will understand what is happening in our surroundings and suggest to us what to do. And AI/ML is at the basis of natural language processing which is important to have digital humans we can interact with in XR. There are many joint use cases and these technologies are relevant the one for the other that’s why it is important they are both growing trends together.

I also underline how the outlook for these technologies is quite long. The metaverse has an outlook of 10+ years to be developed and become mainstream exactly like digital humans and a bit less than web3 which is predicted to have a 5-10 years timeframe. While we all know that business analysts are not good at making accurate predictions I think that these are reasonable predictions with the data we have now. And they show once more that the road to the metaverse is still very long and complicated. Notwithstanding all the hype the predictions of the trillions coming and all people saying that we already have “metaverses” (I’m crying while writing this word) now actually the real metaverse is coming in a lot of years because it requires many technology disruptions plus its social acceptance.

Jake Zim says that we must be in the field for a long time

As Jake Zim told me when I interviewed him if we really believe in these technologies we must commit to staying in the field for the next 10 years. Because even if we have already walked a long road we are still in the early days and we need many years to see our dreams finally come true.

I’m in for this what about you?

What is Inertial Navigation System? How big is the Inertial Navigation SystemIndustry?

Report Overview:

An object's velocity gravitational force and directional orientation are all calculated using an inertial navigation system. Motion sensors accelerometers and gyroscopes are components of an inertial navigation system. The accelerometer detects the amount of change in the speed of drones aircraft and ships. In contrast the gyroscope measures an item's angular velocity such as drones ships and aircraft utilizing sensors. The direction and relative position of the object is inferred from such derivations.

Additionally inertial navigation systems are employed in aerospace and navigation applications where precision and performance are highly important. Moreover inertial navigation technology uses mathematical computations to measure a vehicle's acceleration. Inertial navigation systems have a lot to offer unmanned systems like unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These are frequently used in the oil and gas and defence sectors. UUVs are used in the defence sector for port security deactivating underwater mines and counterattacking. These unmanned vehicles use inertial navigation systems (INS) which provide accurate navigation and location data.

Market Dynamics

The primary reason fueling the market's expansion is the rising need for unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs). UUVs are widely utilized in scientific research defensive weapons that need high precision and oil and gas exploration. The need for the product is further increased because UUVs are employed for oil rig building pipeline inspections and maintenance tasks due to the rising global oil consumption. A further factor boosting the market's expansion is the booming aerospace industry.

A good picture for the market is also being created by several technological developments such as the release of light-powered small-sized navigation systems that use fiber optics and ring laser gyros. However it is anticipated that the market for inertial navigation systems will develop slowly due to the operational complexity involved with these systems and declining defense budgets in some larger nations.

Likewise the fluoroscopy x-ray market returned to growth after a year of retraction in demand in 2020 with 18% year-on-year growth in 2021 and an estimated market size of $509 million (518 million euros).

These figures taken from Signify Research's General Radiography and Fluoroscopy -- World 2022 report show a strong recovery from the challenges experienced during the heights of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Demand returns to fixed-room radiography in 2021

Demand for fixed-room digital radiography systems returned to growth in 2021 as procurement budgets were made available after having been temporarily diverted to fund mobile x-ray purchases in the early phases of the pandemic. This allowed previously planned projects to resume and upgrades and replacements to be installed.

For developed regions and countries higher-end features to help tackle the backlog are now increasingly sought after including autopositioning cameras to ensure minimal patient movement before imaging and artificial intelligence (AI)-based image analysis. Such features improve workflow increase the throughput of an imaging department and should help healthcare providers gradually clear some of the backlog created from the pandemic.

Conversely the digital mobile x-ray market retracted by 18% in revenue terms in 2021 closing at $684 million (672 million euros). However this decline was not as severe as previously forecast with some sustained demand remaining. During the pandemic obvious benefits of mobile imaging were reinforced including portability for bedside imaging. Growth is expected to return for mobile DR in 2024 as replacement of older mobile systems drives demand.

For mobile radiography the importance of brand loyalty in purchasing decisions also returned after temporary focus solely on inventory available during the pandemic. This allowed smaller local vendors to win significant share in new markets as they could service demand from local inventory more readily than global brands. Once global vendor inventory returned to a more normal level purchasers often reverted to previous purchasing habits.

The general radiography market has experienced issues across the supply chain. Many components including steel and semiconductors are in short supply. Coupled with rising costs of transportation and limited availability of shipping average selling prices are expected to rise by approximately 8% in the short term for general radiography systems before stabilizing and declining again. This is also adding to lead times for projects with systems taking a lot longer to reach customers.

Fluoroscopy also returned to growth but demand is expected to become more specialized

Demand for fluoroscopy also returned to growth in 2021 with 18% year-on-year revenue growth to $509 million (500 million euros) reported up from $431 million (424 million euros) in 2020. However fewer fluoroscopic procedures are now being performed with other modalities like CT and MRI taking precedence for procedures traditionally conducted on fluoroscopy systems. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) and barium swallow procedures remain the most procedures maintaining clinical demand for fluoroscopy and will remain essential for the long-term health of this modality.

With fewer fluoroscopic exams being performed and increased focus on return of investment in purchasing decisions multipurpose systems are now even more desirable especially in North America and Western Europe.

Fluoroscopy revenues will surpass 2019 pre-COVID levels next year but growth will be limited after this as other imaging modalities continue to challenge fluoroscopy. The fluoroscopy market is set to reach $614 million (603 million euros) by 2026.

Key trends by region

North America

The U.S. continues to be one of the few countries still favoring classical fluoroscopy systems due to historical training practices concerns of patient movement threatening image quality and potential litigation. Demand is expected to gradually transition to remote systems as new generations of radiographers are trained on remote systems; classical is however still expected to be dominant in the next five years.

In the general radiography market demand for high-end features is increasing with tools to aid workflow becoming highly desirable for many imaging centers and hospitals.

Latin America

The Latin America market continues to be highly cost sensitive with options like computed radiography retrofit and analog systems remaining popular. For many end users there is a desire to digitalize but currently the price point remains prohibitive. For the digital solutions that are sold low-end systems with a lower price point are by far the preferred option -- over 50% of fixed and mobile solutions revenue came from the low-end in 2021.

Fluoroscopy remains a very small market in Latin America with the high price point proving a significant barrier for entry to this market. Brazil is the largest adopter of fluoroscopy in the region with most other Latin American countries seeing minimal sales.

Western Europe

High-end product continues to dominate the general radiography market in Western Europe with 68% of revenue for fixed-room product coming from high-end systems in 2021. Floor-mounted systems sell more in unit terms in Western Europe but with a lower average sales price; revenue from ceiling mounted solutions accounts for a higher proportion of the market.

Most Western Europe markets have limited demand for fluoroscopy with France being the key exception. Almost 30% of all revenue in Western Europe comes from this country. France is also unique in that many healthcare providers prefer to use dedicated fluoroscopy systems rather than multi-purpose which is generally utilized in the rest of Western Europe.

Eastern Europe Middle East and Africa (EEMEA)

Parts of EEMEA remain very cost-sensitive with Africa and less-developed countries in the Middle East seeing high adoption rates of computed radiography analog and retrofit systems. For many digital solutions are too costly especially with the added infrastructure costs to enable PACS and other healthcare IT solutions on top of the imaging systems. Servicing imaging equipment can also be a barrier to adoption with few engineers available locally to quickly fix broken systems.

Fluoroscopy remains very small for most of EEMEA. The areas that have stronger installed bases are in French-speaking north Africa where demand follows France. In parts of the Middle East such as in Saudi Arabia some trends follow the U.S. as some radiographers were trained in the States and therefore follow classical fluoroscopy installation practices.

Asia Pacific

Asia Pacific remains cost sensitive in many parts of the region with 57% of fixed room revenue coming from the low-end segments. In countries like India high levels of analog and computed radiography (CR) systems remain significant. In China CT imaging is increasingly preferred over high-end digital radiography.

Japan remains essential to the long-term growth of the fluoroscopy markets with 45% of all unit sales in the region coming from this country alone. Elsewhere demand is minimal with costs proving prohibitive to adoption.

Competitive landscape

A return to a more conventional vendor landscape was evident in 2021 with global brands such as Siemens Healthineers GE HealthCare and Philips regaining market share temporarily lost during the pandemic when demand outstripped the available supply. With these vendors able to fulfill demand smaller local vendors dropped share.

In the fixed DR market Siemens strengthened its position with a gain of 2.5 percentage points. For mobile DR GE reclaimed the top position as Carestream Health experienced a difficult year after a very strong 2020.

For the fluoroscopy market Siemens led with a very strong 2021 gaining further share. Shimadzu Medical Systems follows with strong sales in its domestic market.

Outlook

The fixed DR market will continue to recover. Budgets will continue to return for fixed-room installations and projects previously postponed will be able to restart. Additionally in some countries like the U.S. replacement cycles will stimulate further growth toward the end of the forecast. Globally ceiling-suspended fixed-room product revenue will grow at a faster pace (5% compound annual growth from 2021-2026) than floor-mounted systems (4% compound annual growth rate) especially in more developed markets where the desire for high-end features often found in ceiling-mounted solutions are increasingly required.

Low-end system demand will continue to be driven by cost-sensitive markets such as Latin America Africa the Middle East and parts of Asia. However the price of digital solutions will need to be significantly reduced to be an attainable option for these regions. Until the price falls sufficiently analog CR and retrofit systems will continue to play an important role.

Fluoroscopy systems will also see limited growth but will also come under increasing pressure from other modalities such as CT and endoscopy. At the end of the forecast low-single-digit annual revenue growth is predicted. In many countries and regions the demand for fluoroscopy will come predominantly from multipurpose systems; as fewer procedures are performed on the systems budget holders will want to minimize downtime by enabling other general radiography imaging.

IdeaPad

The IdeaPad is Lenovo’s budget and midrange consumer line offering a wide variety of affordable and well-built laptops to fit the needs of most users. The line ranges from the $230 IdeaPad Flex 3 with an 11.6-inch 16:9 Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS display and an AMD Athlon Silver 3050e CPU up to the $1450 IdeaPad Slim 7 Pro with a 16-inch 16:10 WQXGA (2560 x 1600) IPS display and an AMD Ryzen 7 5800H CPU.

Intel’s 12th-generation CPU lineup is available as you move up in price and AMD’s Ryzen 6000 lineup also makes an appearance. You’ll also find discrete GPUs up to the Nvidia RTX 3050 Ti.

IdeaPad construction ranges from an all-plastic to an all-metal chassis with a variety of color schemes and aesthetic designs. The IdeaPad line includes clamshell laptops like the IdeaPad 5 Pro 360-degree convertible 2-in-1s where the display flips all the way around such as the IdeaPad Flex 5i and entry-level gaming laptops like the IdeaPad Gaming 3i.

Shop carefully and you can find high-quality displays with solid colors brightness and contrast plus build quality keyboards and touchpads that rival premium laptops. The IdeaPad line overlaps a bit with the premium Yoga lineup below while providing attractive budget options at the very low end.

Yoga

The Yoga is Lenovo’s premium consumer convertible 2-in-1 lineup meaning these are laptops with 360-degree hinges and touchscreens. Currently they’re comprised of several models including the Yoga 6 the Yoga 7i and the Yoga 9i. Each model plays a particular role within the line.

The Yoga 6 is the smallest with 13.3-inch displays and it’s the least expensive. It’s also AMD-only currently offering the AMD Ryzen 5000 series specifically the Ryzen 5 5500U and the Ryzen 7 5700U. You get Radeon graphics up to 16GB of RAM up to a 1TB solid-state drive (SSD) and a 13.3-inch 16:10 WUXGA (1920 x 1200) IPS touch display. The Yoga 6 features an all-metal chassis with an optional fabric top cover coming in at 0.68 inches thick and weighing 3.02 pounds. It’s priced from $675 to $1100 depending on the configuration.

The Yoga 7i sits in the middle of the Yoga line. It offers a high-quality build and with the 14-inch and 16-inch models a gorgeous new aesthetic with rounded edges that makes it one of the best-designed convertible 2-in-1s around. You can get a Yoga 7i in one of three sizes — 14 inches 15 inches and 16 inches — with the 15-inch model being a generation behind.

The Yoga 9i sits at the top of the lineup offering a unique 2-in-1 design with a soundbar integral to the 360-degree hinge that blasts audio in whatever the laptop’s orientation. It’s incredibly well-built and offers a stunning 14-inch 16:10 OLED display at WQHD+ (2880 x 1800) resolution. It competes strongly with the best 2-in-1s on the market.

The Yoga line offers Lenovo’s best consumer build quality and innovation. You’ll find lovely designs excellent performance and battery life and class-leading privacy and security features in Lenovo Yoga machines.

Slim

The Slim is Lenovo’s premium line of clamshell laptops. It’s a little confusing because you’ll find models labeled as “IdeaPad Slim.” We’re talking here about the Slim 7 and Slim 9 that serve the same audience as the Yoga line only without the 2-in-1 flexibility.

The Slim 7 comes in a few flavors including Intel and AMD versions and 13.3-inch 14-inch and 16-inch varieties. The lowest price you’ll find is the $1300 Slim 7i Carbon with a Core i7-1260P and a 13.3-inch WQXGA IPS display. At the high end is the $1640 Slim 7i 16 with a 45-watt Intel Core i7-12700H an Intel Arc A370M GPU and a 16-inch 2.5K (2560 x 1600) IPS 120Hz display.

The Slim 9 is the highest-end Slim laptop with the same rounded design as the $2070 Yoga 9i Gen 7. It sports an Intel Core i7-1280P CPU and a 14-inch WQUXGA (3840 x 2400) OLED display with 32GB of RAM and either a 512GB or 1GB SSD.

ThinkPad

The ThinkPad line was inherited from IBM and Lenovo has maintained the line’s iconic look and feel sturdy design and business features. It’s also a massive lineup with 347 models currently listed at Lenovo.com ranging from the $569 ThinkPad E15 (AMD) at the low end to the $4175 ThinkPad X1 Extreme Gen 5 at the high end.

The ThinkPad line is full of excellent machines many of which have shown up on our best business laptops list. The ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10 for example is an excellent 14-inch business laptop that offers a sturdy thin and light chassis with solid performance and battery life. The ThinkPad X13s is a recent laptop that leverages Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 ARM CPU for great battery life in a diminutive chassis. The ThinkPad is known for its all-black chassis with red accents excellent keyboard touchpad and TrackPoint and solid business features.

Fortunately the ThinkPad line is broken up into easily digested pieces:

C Series: ThinkPads running Google’s Chrome OS specifically the $1019 Thinkpad C14 Chromebook Enterprise .

. L Series: These are entry-level business machines. Prices range from the $571 ThinkPad L13 Gen 3 (AMD) to the $2010 ThinkPad Yoga L13 Gen 3 with Intel inside.

to the $2010 with Intel inside. X Series: These are the smallest ThinkPads including machines like the ThinkPad X12 Detachable and the ThinkPad X13s.

T Series: With workhorse laptops with simpler designs and high performance the T Series has a wide range of machines starting with the $755 ThinkPad T14 Gen 2 up to the $3999 ThinkPad T15g .

up to the $3999 . Z Series: This is the newest ThinkPad line that’s aimed at sustainability via recyclable materials. The Z Series has two models the ThinkPad Z13 starting at $1355 and the ThinkPad Z16 starting at $1975.

starting at $1355 and the starting at $1975. E Series: As ThinkPad’s more affordable lineup it starts with the ThinkPad E15 Gen 4 (AMD) mentioned above which is the least expensive ThinkPad and ranges up to the $1000 ThinkPad E15 Gen 4 Intel version.

version. P Series: This is ThinkPad’s workstation lineup aimed at scientific engineering and creative users. The P Series utilizes the fastest Intel 12th-gen 45-watt Core CPUs like the Core i9-12900HX and professional-level GPUs like the Nvidia RTX A5500. The entry-level ThinkPad workstation is the ThinkPad P16s (AMD) at $1319 and the line tops out at the $5059 ThinkPad P1 Gen 5 .

(AMD) at $1319 and the line tops out at the $5059 . X1 Series: The ThinkPad’s ultra-premium lineup with both clamshell and 2-in-1 form factors has standout machines that include the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10 mentioned above and the ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 7. ThinkPad X1 prices start at $949 for the ThinkPad X1 Tablet Gen 3 and max out at the $2513 ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10 .

Navigating your way through the ThinkPad lineup can be a challenge but suffice it to say that if you do your research you’ll find a business-class laptop that will accomplish every possible objective. There are few manufacturers that offer a business laptop lineup that’s so diverse.

ThinkBook

The ThinkBook line is Lenovo’s nod to the small business. It offers features that businesspeople will appreciate like solid build qualities privacy and security and innovative features. Speaking of the latter the ThinkBook platform hosts a couple of unique models in the ThinkBook Plus Gen 2 with an e-ink screen on the lid and the ThinkBook Plus Gen 3 with a large second screen to the right of the keyboard.

Otherwise ThinkBooks are well-designed laptops with top performance and battery life and outstanding connectivity. The line ranges in price from the $842 ThinkBook 15 Gen 4 to the $2609 ThinkBook Plus Gen 2. You can choose between Intel 12th-gen and AMD Ryzen 6000 CPUs and display options range from Full HD up to UHD+.

Most ThinkBook models are clamshell laptops but the line does include a couple of convertible 2-in-1s. The ThinkBook Plus Gen 2 is one of course and the other is the $1400 ThinkBook 14s Yoga Gen 2. If you’re a business person who wants the right business features but doesn’t need enterprise security and management then the ThinkBook line is a great option.

Legion

Finally Lenovo has its Legion line of gaming laptops. The company’s least expensive gaming machines fall in the IdeaPad line and so Legion starts at midrange and goes up from there. The line is a mix of conservatively designed thin and light gaming laptops and machines with more of a gaming aesthetic — although Lenovo avoids creating the kind of extravagant designs as some other gaming laptop makers.

The entry-level is represented by the $1100 Legion 5 Gen 6 with an AMD Ryzen 5 CPU and RTX 3050 GPU which is equipped to run modern titles at 1080p and medium graphics. At the high end is the $4120 Legion 7i Gen 7 with an Intel Core i9-12900HX and an RTX 3080 Ti that’s more than capable of running games at 4K resolutions and high graphics.

Mixed in the lineup is the full range of Intel and AMD CPUs and Nvidia GPUs with displays sporting high refresh rates at 165Hz and higher. We’ve found Lenovo’s Legion lineup of gaming laptops to be quite competitive with the rest of the field.

Nvidia has long been the dominant player in the graphics card market but the company has from time to time been put under serious pressure by its main rival AMD which has launched several of its own iconic GPUs. Those only set Nvidia up for a major comeback however and sometimes that led to a real game-changing card.

It was hard to choose which Nvidia GPUs were truly worthy of being called the best of all time but I’ve narrowed down the list to six cards that were truly important and made history.

GeForce 256

The very first

Although Nvidia often claims the GeForce 256 was the world’s first GPU that’s only true if Nvidia is the only company that gets to define what a GPU is. Before GeForce there were the RIVA series of graphics cards and there were other companies making their own competing graphics cards then too. What Nvidia really invented was the marketing of graphics cards as GPUs because in 1999 when the 256 came out terms like graphics card and graphics chipset were more common.

Nvidia is right that the 256 was important however. Before the 256 the CPU played a very important role in rendering graphics to the point where the CPU was directly completing steps in rendering a 3D environment. However CPUs were not very efficient at doing this which is where the 256 came in with hardware transforming and lighting offloading the two most CPU intensive parts of rendering onto the GPU. This is one of the primary reasons why Nvidia claims this is the first GPU.

As a product the GeForce 256 wasn’t exactly legendary: Anandtech wasn’t super impressed by its price for the performance at the time of its release. Part of the problem was the 256’s memory which was single data rate or SDR. Due to other advances SDR was becoming insufficient for GPUs of this performance level. A faster dual data rate or DDR (the same DDR as in DDR5) launched just before the end of 1999 which finally met Anandtech’s expectations for performance but the increased price tag of the DDR version was hard to swallow.

The GeForce 256 first of its name is certainly historical but not because it was an amazing product. The 256 is important because it inaugurated the modern era of GPUs. The graphics card market wasn’t always a duopoly; back in the 90s there were multiple companies competing against each other with Nvidia being just one of them. Soon after the GeForce 256 launched most of Nvidia’s rivals exited the market. 3dfx’s Voodoo 5 GPUs were uncompetitive and before it went bankrupt many of its technologies were bought by Nvidia; Matrox simply quit gaming GPUs altogether to focus on professional graphics.

By the end of 2000 the only other graphics company in town was ATI. When AMD acquired ATI in 2006 it brought about the modern Nvidia and AMD rivalry we all know today.

GeForce 8800 GTX

A monumental leap forward

After the GeForce 256 Nvidia and ATI attempted to best the other with newer GPUs with higher performance. In 2002 however ATI threw down the gauntlet by launching its Radeon 9000 series and at a die size of 200mm squared the flagship Radeon 9800 XT was easily the largest GPU ever. Nvidia’s flagship GeForce4 Ti 4600 at 100mm had no hope of beating even the midrange 9700 Pro which inflicted a crushing defeat on Nvidia. Making a GPU was no longer just about the architecture the memory or the drivers; in order to win Nvidia would need to make big GPUs like ATI.

For the next four years the size of flagship GPUs continued to increase and by 2005 both companies had launched a GPU that was around 300mm. Although Nvidia had regained the upper hand during this time ATI was never far behind and its Radeon X1000 series was fairly competitive. A GPU sized at 300mm was far from the limit of what Nvidia could do however. In 2006 Nvidia released its GeForce 8 series led by the flagship 8800 GTX. Its GPU codenamed G80 was nearly 500mm and its transistor count was almost three times higher than the last GeForce flagship.

The 8800 GTX did to ATI what the Radeon 9700 Pro and the rest of the 9000 series did to Nvidia with Anandtech describing the moment as “9700 Pro-like.” A single 8800 GTX was almost twice as fast as ATI’s top-end X1950 XTX not to mention much more efficient. At $599 the 8800 GTX was more expensive than its predecessors but its high level of performance and DirectX 10 support made up for it.

But this was mostly the end of the big GPU arms race that had characterized the early 2000s for two main reasons. Firstly 500mm was getting pretty close to the limit of how large a GPU could be and even today 500mm is relatively big for a processor. Even if Nvidia wanted to making a bigger GPU just wasn’t feasible. Secondly ATI wasn’t working on its own 500mm GPU anyway so Nvidia wasn’t in a rush to get an even bigger GPU to market. Nvidia had basically won the arms race by outspending ATI.

That year also saw the acquisition of ATI by AMD which was finalized just before the 8800 GTX launched. Although ATI now had the backing of AMD it really seemed like Nvidia had such a massive lead that Radeon wouldn’t challenge GeForce for a long time perhaps never again.

GeForce GTX 680

Beating AMD at its own game

Nvidia’s next landmark release came in 2008 when it launched the GTX 200 series starting with the GTX 280 and GTX 260. At nearly 600mm squared the 280 was a worthy monstrous successor to the 8800 GTX. Meanwhile AMD and ATI signaled that they would no longer be launching high-end GPUs with big dies in order to compete rather focusing on making smaller GPUs in a gambit known as the small die strategy. In its review Anandtech said “Nvidia will be left all alone with top performance for the foreseeable future.” As it turned out the next four years were pretty rough for Nvidia.

Starting with the HD 4000 series in 2008 AMD assaulted Nvidia with small GPUs that had high value and almost flagship levels of performance and that dynamic was maintained throughout the next few generations. Nvidia’s GTX 280 wasn’t cost effective enough then the GTX 400 series was delayed and the 500 series was too hot and power hungry.

One of Nvidia’s traditional weaknesses was its disadvantage when it came to process the way processors are manufactured. Nvidia was usually behind AMD but it had finally caught up by using the 40nm node for the 400 series. AMD however wanted to regain the process lead quickly and decided its next generation would be on the new 28nm node and Nvidia decided to follow suit.

AMD won the race to 28nm with its HD 7000 series with its flagship HD 7970 putting AMD back in first place for performance. However the GTX 680 launched just two months later and not only did it beat the 7970 in performance but also power efficiency and even die size. As Anandtech put it Nvidia had “landed the technical trifecta” and that completely flipped the tables on AMD. AMD did reclaim the performance crown yet again by launching the HD 7970 GHz Edition later in 2012 (notable for being the first 1GHz GPU) but having the lead in efficiency and performance per millimeter was a good sign for Nvidia.

The back and forth battle between Nvidia and AMD was pretty exciting after how disappointing the GTX 400 and 500 series had been and while the 680 wasn’t an 8800 GTX it signaled Nvidia’s return to being truly competitive against AMD. Perhaps most importantly Nvidia was no longer weighed down by its traditional process disadvantage and that would eventually pay off in a big way.

GeForce GTX 980

Nvidia’s dominance begins

Nvidia found itself in a very good spot with the GTX 600 series and it was because of TSMC’s 28nm process. Under normal circumstances AMD would have simply gone to TSMC’s next process in order to regain its traditional advantage but this was no longer an option. TSMC and all other foundries in the world (except for Intel) had an extraordinary amount of difficulty progressing beyond the 28nm node. New technologies were needed in order to progress further which meant Nvidia didn’t have to worry about AMD regaining the process lead any time soon.

Following a few years of back and forth and AMD floundering with limited funds Nvidia launched the GTX 900 series in 2014 inaugurated by the GTX 980. Based on the new Maxwell architecture it was an incredible improvement over the GTX 600 and 700 series despite being on the same node. The 980 was between 30% and 40% faster than the 780 while consuming less power and it was even a smidge faster than the top-end 780 Ti. Of course the 980 also beat the R9 290X once again landing the trifecta of performance power efficiency and die size. In its review Anandtech said the 980 came “very very close to doing to the Radeon 290X what the GTX 680 did to Radeon HD 7970.”

AMD was incapable of responding. It didn’t have a next-generation GPU ready to launch in 2014. In fact AMD wasn’t even working on a complete lineup of brand-new GPUs to even the score with Nvidia. AMD instead was planning on rebranding the Radeon 200 series as the Radeon 300 series and would develop one new GPU to serve as the flagship. All of these GPUs were to launch in mid 2015 giving the entire GPU market to Nvidia for nearly a full year. Of course Nvidia wanted to pull the rug right from under AMD and prepared a brand-new flagship.

Launching in mid 2015 the GTX 980 Ti was about 30% faster than the GTX 980 thanks to its significantly higher power consumption and larger die size at just over 600mm squared. It beat AMD’s brand-new R9 Fury X a month before it even launched. Although the Fury X wasn’t bad it had lower performance than the 980 Ti higher power consumption and much less VRAM. It was a demonstration of how far ahead Nvidia was with the 900 series; while AMD was hastily trying to get the Fury X out the door Nvidia could have launched the 980 Ti any time it wanted.

Anandtech put it pretty well: “The fact that they get so close only to be outmaneuvered by Nvidia once again makes the current situation all the more painful; it’s one thing to lose to Nvidia by feet but to lose by inches only reminds you of just how close they got how they almost upset Nvidia.”

Nvidia was basically a year ahead of AMD technologically and while what they had done with the GTX 900 series was impressive it was also a bit depressing. People wanted to see Nvidia and AMD duke it out like they had done in 2012 and 2013 but it started to look like that was all in the past. Nvidia’s next GPU would certainly reaffirm that feeling.

GeForce GTX 1080

The GPU with no competition but itself

In 2015 TSMC had finally completed the 16nm process which could achieve 40% higher clock speeds than 28nm at the same power or half the power of 28nm at similar clock speeds. However Nvidia planned to move to 16nm in 2016 when the node was more mature. Meanwhile AMD had absolutely no plans to utilize TSMC’s 16nm but instead moved to launch new GPUs and CPUs on GlobalFoundries’s 14nm process. But don’t be fooled by the names: TSMC’s 16nm was and is better than GlobalFoundries’s 14nm. After 28nm nomenclature for processes became based in marketing rather than scientific measurements. This meant that for the first time in modern GPU history Nvidia had the process advantage against AMD.

The GTX 10-series launched in mid-2016 based on the new Pascal architecture and TSMC’s 16nm node. Pascal wasn’t actually very different from Maxwell but the jump from 28nm to 16nm was massive like Intel going from 14nm on Skylake to 10nm on Alder Lake. The GTX 1080 was the new flagship and it’s hard to overstate how fast it was. The GTX 980 was a little faster than the GTX 780 Ti when it came out. By contrast the GTX 1080 was over 30% faster than the GTX 980 Ti and for $50 less too. The die size of the 1080 was also extremely impressive at just over 300mm squared nearly half the size of the 980 Ti.

With the 1080 and the rest of the 10-series lineup Nvidia effectively took the entire desktop GPU market for itself. AMD’s 300 series and the Fury X were simply no match. At the midrange AMD launched the RX 400 series but these were just three low to mid-range GPUs that were a throwback to the small die strategy minus the part where Nvidia’s flagship was in striking distance like with the GTX 280 and the HD 4870. In fact the 1080 was nearly twice as fast as the RX 480. The only GPU AMD could really beat was the mid-range GTX 1060 as the slightly cut down GTX 1070 was just a little too fast to lose to the Fury X.

AMD did eventually launch new high-end GPUs in the form of RX Vega a full year after the 1080 came out. With much higher power consumption and the same selling price the flagship RX Vega 64 beat the GTX 1080 by a hair but wasn’t very competitive. However the GTX 1080 was no longer Nvidia’s flagship; with relatively small die size and a full year to prepare Nvidia launched a brand-new flagship a whole three months before RX Vega even launched; it was a repeat of the 980 Ti. The new GTX 1080 Ti was even faster than the GTX 1080 delivering yet another 30% improvement to performance. As Anandtech put it the 1080 Ti “further solidifie[d] Nvidia’s dominance of the high-end video card market.”

AMD’s failure to deliver a truly competitive high-end GPU meant that the 1080’s only real competition was Nvidia’s own GTX 1080 Ti. With the 1080 and the 1080 Ti Nvidia achieved what is perhaps the most complete victory we’ve seen so far in modern GPU history. Over the past 4 years Nvidia kept increasing its technological advantage over AMD and it was hard to see how Nvidia could ever lose.

GeForce RTX 3080

Correcting course

After such a long and incredible streak of wins perhaps it was inevitable that Nvidia would succumb to hubris and lose sight of what made Nvidia’s great GPUs so great. Nvidia did not follow up the GTX 10 series with yet another GPU with a stunning increase in performance but with the infamous RTX 20 series. Perhaps in a move to cut AMD out of the GPU market Nvidia focused on introducing hardware accelerated ray tracing and A.I. upscaling instead of delivering better performance in general. If successful Nvidia could make AMD GPUs irrelevant until the company finally made Radeon GPUs with built-in ray tracing.

RTX 20-series was a bit of a flop. When the RTX 2080 and 2080 Ti launched in late 2018 there weren’t even any games that supported ray tracing or deep learning super sampling (DLSS). But Nvidia priced RTX 20-series cards as if those features made all the difference. At $699 the 2080 had a nonsensical price and the 2080 Ti’s $1199 price tag was even more insane. Nvidia wasn’t even competing with itself anymore.

The performance improvement in existing titles was extremely disappointing too; the RTX 2080 was only 11% faster than the GTX 1080 though at least the RTX 2080 Ti was around 30% faster than the GTX 1080 Ti.

The next two years were a course correction for Nvidia. The threat from AMD was starting to become pretty serious; the company had finally regained the process advantage by moving to TSMC’s 7nm and the company launched the RX 5700 XT in mid-2019. Nvidia was able to head it off once again by launching new GPUs this time the RTX 20 Super series with a focus on value but the 5700 XT must have worried Nvidia. The RTX 2080 Ti was three times as large yet was only 50% faster meaning AMD was achieving much higher performance per millimeter. If AMD made a larger GPU it could be difficult to beat.

Both Nvidia and AMD planned for a big showdown in 2020. Nvidia recognized AMD’s potential and pulled out all the stops: the new 8nm process from Samsung the new Ampere architecture and an emphasis on big GPUs. AMD meanwhile stayed on TSMC’s 7nm process but introduced the new RDNA 2 architecture and would also be launching a big GPU its first since RX Vega in 2017. The last time both companies launched brand-new flagships within the same year was 2013 nearly a decade ago. Though the pandemic threatened to ruin the plans of both companies neither company was willing to delay the next generation and launched as planned.

Nvidia fired first with the RTX 30-series led by the flagship RTX 3090 but most of the focus was on the RTX 3080 since at $699 it was far more affordable than the $1499 3090. Instead of being a repeat of the RTX 20-series the 3080 delivered a sizeable 30% bump in performance at 4K over the RTX 2080 Ti though the power consumption was a little high. At lower resolutions the performance gain of the 3080 was somewhat less but since the 3080 was very capable at 4K it was easy to overlook this. The 3080 also benefitted from a wider variety of games supporting ray tracing and DLSS giving value to having an Nvidia GPU with those features.

Of course this wouldn’t matter if the 3080 and the rest of the RTX 30-series couldn’t stand up to AMD’s new RX 6000 series which launched two months later. At $649 the RX 6800 XT was AMD’s answer to the RTX 3080. With nearly identical performance in most games and at most resolutions the battle between the 3080 and the 6800 XT was reminiscent of the GTX 680 and the HD 7970. Each company had its advantages and disadvantages with AMD leading in power efficiency and performance while Nvidia had better performance in ray tracing and support for other features like A.I. upscaling.

The excitement over a new episode in the GPU war quickly died out though because it quickly came apparent that nobody could buy RTX 30 or RX 6000 or even any GPUs at all. The pandemic had seriously reduced supply while crypto increased demand and scalpers snatched up as many GPUs as they could. At the time of writing the shortage has mostly ended but most Nvidia GPUs are still selling for usually $100 or more over MSRP. Thankfully higher-end GPUs like the RTX 3080 can be found closer to MSRP than lower-end 30 series cards which keeps the 3080 a viable option.

On the whole the RTX 3080 was a much-needed correction from Nvidia. Although the 3080 has marked the end of Nvidia’s near total domination of the desktop GPU market it’s hard not to give the company credit for not losing to AMD. After all the RX 6000 series is on a much better process and AMD has been extremely aggressive these past few years. And besides it’s good to finally see a close race between Nvidia and AMD where both sides are trying really hard to win.

So what’s next?

Unlike AMD Nvidia always keeps its cards close to its chest and rarely ever reveals information on upcoming products. We can be pretty confident the upcoming RTX 40 series will launch sometime this year but everything else is uncertain. One of the more interesting rumors is that Nvidia will utilize TSMC’s 5nm for RTX 40 GPUs and if this is true then that means Nvidia will have parity with AMD once again.

But I think that as long as RTX 40 isn’t another RTX 20 and provides more low-end and mid-range options than RTX 30 Nvidia should have a good enough product next generation. I would really like for it to be so good that it makes the list of best Nvidia GPUs of all time but we’ll have to wait and see.

The needs of the two groups – aged between 21 and 34 this year – differ significantly from previous generations.

Young adults are digital natives. They tend to gravitate towards online banking rather than turn up at physical branches.

So too their Asean counterparts. The UOB Asean Consumer Sentiment study conducted in July last year found that close to four in five (79 per cent) Asean consumers across all ages have switched to banking apps in 2021.

Among millennials and Gen Zers the increase in usage of banking apps was at 79 per cent and 80 per cent respectively.

Around 3500 respondents – aged between 18 and 65 – from five Asean countries were polled including 1000 from Singapore and more than 600 each from Indonesia Malaysia Thailand and Vietnam.

Asean consumers are also performing different types of transactions digitally. These activities include opening a new bank account (64 per cent) applying for financial products (74 per cent) registering for bank loans (61 per cent) and even checking the status of their rewards programme (86 per cent).

So what makes millennials and Gen Zers stand out? In Asean these young adults are part of a growing population of underserved and increasingly affluent consumers says Mr Kevin Lam UOB head of TMRW and Group Digital Banking.

As they graduate from one stage of life to the next their financial responsibilities grow. This will lead to more touchpoints with banks.

The e-Conomy SEA report published by Google Temasek and Bain & Company in October 2019 noted that around 198 million in South-east Asia are “unbanked” or do not have a bank account. Meanwhile another 98 million are “underserved” which means that they have a bank account but lack access to credit investments and insurance instruments.

Mr Lam explains: “These are the people who could have just started working and are becoming financially stable. They have needs such as getting a credit card or might want to take up a loan for their new home purchase and it’s a great time for them to start investing.”"

August 2022 saw the appearance of a new gate guard at Trapani–Birgi Airport which is a military air base and public airport in Sicily Italy. The gate guard in question is a General Dynamics F-16A Fighting Falcon with Matricola Militare (military registration) MM7240 (msn M22-5/61-403).

It is painted in a special '18° Gruppo Green Lightning' colour scheme which found its origin in 2009. On 8 June 2009 Major Maurizio “Masa” De Angelis commander of the Trapani Air Base based 18° Gruppo celebrated his 1000 flight hours on the F-16.

This particular General Dynamics F-16 was part of the of 34 F-16 fighter jets provided to the Aeronautica Militare (ItAF Italian Air Force) under a programme known as Peace Caesar with the first deliveries in 2003. The Aeronautica Militare chose the leased F-16 option as the most cost-effective solution to replace its aging fleet of Panavia Tornado and Lockheed F-104 Starfighters. Also four non-flyable F-16s were supplied for generation of spare parts.

F-16A MM7240 saw an extensive life with quite an interesting history. Built by General Dynamics as 81-0722 in its Forth Worth plant (TX) it was delivered on 12 November 1982 to the United States Air Force. It served with various units including the Air National Guard.

Most European spotters will remember the Viper as '81-0722/HR' flying from roughly November 1982 to April 1986 with the United States Air Force Europe 50th Tactical Fighter Wing at Hahn Air Force Base in Germany.

After a total refurbishment at Hill AFB (UT) it was delivered in 2004 to the Aeronautica Militare flying with the 18° Gruppo at Trapani-Birgi. After June 2011 it was put in storage only to be revealed right now in these colours.

Basic model

The continuous time extended Kermack and McKendrik SIRS (S=susceptibles I=infected & infectious R=recovered) epidemic model [537] is foundational to the development of epidemiological systems modeling and theory [38]. It is most often formulated in terms of the variables S I and R (note we use the roman font mnemonics S I and R to refer to the names of the disease classes/compartments and italic fonts to the variables themselves). For the sake of completeness we include a disease class D to account for the dead but define the number of individuals alive at time t to be

$$N(t)=S(t)+I(t)+R(t) \quad N(0)=N_{0}$$ (4)

In the context of differential equation models these variables strictly speaking should be interpreted as population density variables; though loosely speaking we think of them in terms of numbers in a closed (no births or natural deaths no migration) homogeneous population (everyone is equally susceptible infectious and likely to make contact with any other individual). From the general systems description given by Eq. 1 if the flow of individuals from disease classes/compartments S to I I to R and R back to S plus a flow of individuals from I to D (disease-induced mortality process) are respectively represented by the per capita flow rates ρ SI  ρ IR  ρ RS  and ρ ID  (solid arrows in Fig. 1) then we obtain the deterministic continuous-time epidemic compartmental SIRS model

$$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} && {\text{SIRS+D cont.-time deterministic model}} \\ \frac{dS}{dt} & = & \rho_{\text{RS}} R - \rho_{\text{SI}}S \quad S(0)=N_{0}-1 \\ \frac{dI}{dt} & = & \rho_{\text{SI}} S - \rho_{\text{IR}} I - \rho_{\text{ID}} I \quad I(0)=1 \\ \frac{dR}{dt} & = & \rho_{\text{IR}} I - \rho_{\text{RS}} R \quad R(0)=0 \\ D(t) & = & \int_{0}^{t} \rho_{\text{ID}} I(t) dt \end{array}$$ (5)

We note the initial conditions included here reflect the start of an epidemic caused by a novel pathogen (and variables though actually continuous are interpreted in terms of numbers of individuals). Other initial conditions can be assumed when using Eq. 5 to simulate a population that is already part way into an epidemic.

In practice once the values or functional forms of the flows ρ XY have been specified for X Y = S I and R solutions will be generated over the time interval [0t fnl ] using numerical simulation techniques.

Constant flow rates

In the simplest case apart from the per capita susceptible flow rate ρ SI  the flows are assumed to be constant and the transfer of individuals from one disease state to another follows an exponential process. The consequences of this assumption are discussed in Table 1.

Extra information. The assumption of a constant flow through X resulting in an exponential exit rate for all members currently in X is unrealistic. To see this consider any particular individual entering X at time t=0. The probability this individual leaves X during the interval [tt+1] is given by (recall Eq. 1.1 in Table 1)

$$\int_{t}^{t+1} f(t;\rho)= e^{-\rho t}-e^{-\rho (t+1)}$$ (6)

This probability has a maximum value of 1−eρ at t=0. If individuals spend several units of time in X it is much more reasonable to assume that the probability they leave X in any particular unit of time is around the mean time \(\bar T^{\mathrm {X}}=\frac {1}{\rho }\) spent in X rather than the very first period of time. One can achieve this more reasonable departure behavior in a continuous-time differential equation model by dividing the disease class X into a say K>1 sub-compartments and have an individual pass through each of these sub-compartments at a rate Kρ resulting in so-called box car models (Appendix B SOF). The exit process from a box-car model with K compartments is by an Erlang distribution with shape parameter K and scale parameter Kρ rather than and Exponential distribution with scale parameter ρ. In an Erlang distribution for which K>1 an individual is most likely to leave during the period that surrounds the mean time that it spends in X which is still \(\bar T^{\mathrm {X}}=\frac {1}{\rho }\) rather than immediately on entering as implied by Eq. 6 for the exponential case. The box car or Erlang model is described in more detail in Appendix B (SOF).

Disease transmission

The per capita flow rate ρ SI from the susceptible to the infectious class is more complicated than the per capita flow rates between the other disease classes. This flow rate represents a disease transmission process that depends on susceptible and infectious individuals making contact with one another. This contact process in the original Kermack-McKendrick model was assumed to be dependent on the product S(t)I(t) of the susceptible and infectious classes. This approach draws its inspiration from the Law of Mass Action that pertains to chemical kinetics. The resulting incidence—the rate of new infections—then takes on the eponymous βSI transmission rate where β is a parameter whose value reflects the joint effects of both an underlying contact rate and a ‘probability of transmission’ per contact (inverted commas are used because only in the stochastic model as developed in “SIRS discrete and stochastic formulations” section are probabilities made explicit; also see “The basic reproductive rate r-zero and probability of infection” section on how to derive the probability of transmission per contact). A more appropriate approach to modeling disease transmissions and hence the incidence rate in humans (at all but the very lowest population densities found in rural areas) is to assume that: 1.) each individual in the population contacts others at a per capita rate κ; and 2.) only the proportion of contacts with infectious individuals—i.e. I(t)/N(t)—can lead to transmission. Further not every contact will lead to transmission but will be scaled according to a force of infection parameter β. In this case we typically represent transmission by a per capita susceptible function that has the frequency dependent form [39]

$$\rho_{\text{SI}}=\kappa \beta \frac{I(t)}{N(t)}$$ (7)

In this case total incidence which we denote by Δ+I(t) (Δ+ is used to denote change due to new additions to I before accounting for the individuals that leave I) is now given the function

$${\text{Incidence:}} \qquad \qquad \Delta^{+} I(t) = \rho_{\text{SI}}S(t)=\kappa \beta \frac{S(t)I(t)}{N(t)}$$ (8)

More elaborate incidence functions have been proposed [40] particularly in the disease ecology literature [41]. Equation 7 however is the one we will focus on throughout this exposition. Also in most of the literature the processes of contact represented by the parameter κ and force of transmission per contact represented by the parameter β are not separated but are effectively rolled into a single constant β κ =κ×β with no subscript used (equivalent to setting κ=1). In this case the contact process itself is no longer transparent. We believe that the contact process should always be explicit as a reminder that transmission requires ‘effective contacts’ to be made. Note that it does not make SIR models dynamically more complex when β κ is represented as the product of two constants: i.e. when β κ =κ×β. An effective contact is one that result in pathogen transmission. Contacts that do not result in transmission are part of more complex epidemic models that consider quarantining as a mitigation strategy [7] because not all quarantined individuals become infected.

Constant and adaptive contact rates

Most SIR models implicitly assume a constant contact rate

$${\text{Constant contact:}} \qquad \qquad \kappa(t)=\kappa_{0} \quad \text{for all } t\in[0t_{\text{fnl}}]$$ (9)

Arguably one of the most important modifications to the transmission rate and incidence expressions given by Eqs. 7 and 8 is to account for changes in contact rates once a pandemic has started. This behavior was seen with regards to the Ebola pandemic of 2015 [36] as well as COVID-19 pandemic [7]. One way to deal with this is to assume the contact rate adapts by decreasing either as a function of incidence (Eq. 8) or the proportion of individuals that are infectious (i.e. I(t)/N(t)). If we assume the latter then a three parameter form for the contact rate κ(t) that depends on a basic contact rate κ 0 >0 an infectious proportion switching point P κ ∈(01) and an abruptness switching parameter σ κ ≥0 is given by the function [8]:

$${\text{Adaptive contact:}} \qquad \qquad \kappa(t)=\frac{\kappa_{0}}{1+\left(\frac{I(t)}{N(t)}/P_{\kappa}\right)^{\sigma_{\kappa}}}$$ (10)

The switching point parameter σ κ may be set to 2 for gradual switching 5 for relatively abrupt switching or 20 to approximate a step function around the infectious proportion switching point P κ .

The basic reproductive rate r-zero and probability of infection

The basic reproductive rate R 0  of a disease at the start of an epidemic in a population that has never been exposed to the pathogen causing the outbreak represents the number of expected new cases that the index case (aka patient zero) will cause. This number is represented by

$$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} R_{0} & = & \text{contact rate} \times \text{force of transmission per contact} \times \text{infectious period} \\ & = & \kappa \times \beta \times \frac{1}{\rho_{\text{IR}}} \ = \ \frac{\kappa\beta}{\rho_{\text{IR}}} \end{array}$$ (11)

The product κβ can be used to obtain the incidence per susceptible over a short time interval Δt at the start of the epidemic (also interpreted as the probability of a susceptible becoming infected over [01]) by solving for the incidence over the period t∈[0Δt] assuming I 0 =1. This number can be obtained by first solving the differential equation

$$\frac{dS}{dt}= - \kappa \beta I_{0} S \qquad \text{i.e. } I(t)=I_{0} \text{ treated as constant for } t \in [0\Delta t]$$

Integrating the above equation for the condition I 0 =1 (to see how many susceptibles are infected by a single inectious individual; and assuming both κ and β constant over this interval) implies that S(Δt)=e−κβΔtS 0 . Since the expected proportion of susceptibles that will become infected over [0Δt] (i.e. those that leave class S for class I) is given by \(p_{\text {inf}}=\frac {S(0)-S(\Delta t)}{S(0)}\) (also interpreted as the initial probability of infection) we obtain the expression

$$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} && {\text{Probability of infection per contact on } [0\Delta t]} \\ p_{\text{infect}}(0\Delta t) & = &\left(1-e^{-\kappa \beta \Delta t}\right) \quad \text{for small } \Delta t \end{array}$$ (12)

Finally we reiterate that most SIRS formulations do not explicitly identify a contact rate κ so that this parameter does not appear at all in these formulations and also that γ is used instead of ρ IR (γ≡ρ IR ). In such cases R 0 =β/γ and p infect (0Δt)=(1−e−βΔt). But as previously mentioned it is useful to explicitly include κ because it is needed to discuss adaptive contact and provide the structure needed to introduce quarantine rates in a sensible way.

SIRS discrete and stochastic formulations

The discretized version of the SIRS model when disease-induced deaths are not considered is given by the following set of t=01...t fnl when simulated over the interval [0t fnl ]

$$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} && {\text{SIRS discrete-time model}} \\ S(t+1) & = & \left(1- p_{\text{SI}}\right)S(t) + p_{\text{RS}} R(t) \quad S(0)=N_{0}-1 \\ I(t+1) & = & \left(1- p_{\text{IR}}\right)I(t) + p_{\text{SI}} S(t) \quad \ \ I(0)=1 \\ R(t+1) & = & \left(1- p_{\text{RS}}\right)R(t) + p_{\text{IR}} I(t) \quad R(0)=0 \end{array}$$ (13)

where the proportions p XY are related to the rates ρ XY by the equation (see Table 1 and cf. Eq. 12)

$$p_{\text{XY}} = 1- e^{-\rho_{\text{XY}}} \quad \text{X}

e \text{Y and X Y} = \text{ S I and R}$$ (14)

Thus as required p XY =0 when ρ XY =0 and p XY →1 as ρ XY →∞.

A discrete-time stochastic version of this model is obtained from Eq. 13 by assuming that the quantities p SI represent probabilities proportions. (Note: Continuous-time stochastic models require a level of mathematical treatment beyond the scope of this presentation; e.g see [42]). In this case the simulation takes the form of a discrete-time Monte Carlo process in which drawings from a binomial distribution are considered rather than computations of proportional change. Specifically simulation involves the following drawings using the following notation to denote such drawings (aka samplings):

$$\hat X_{p} \sim \texttt{BINOMIAL}[Xp] \quad \text{with expected value}\ {pX}\ \text{and variance} p(1-p)X$$

We note that \(\hat X_{p}\) is the actual number of actual objects drawn or sampled from a total of X objects where each object has the probability p of being selected (and hence 1−p of not being selected).

Formally our stochastic model is the following Monte Carlo simulation that begins with specified values for S(0) I(0) R(0) and D(0) and continues with successive samplings for t=12...t fnl :

$$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} && {\text{SIRS stochastic model}} \\ \hat S_{\mathrm{I}}(t) & \sim & \texttt{BINOMIAL}[S(t)p_{\text{SI}}] \\ \hat I_{\mathrm{R}}(t) & \sim & \texttt{BINOMIAL}[I(t)p_{\text{IR}}] \\ \hat R_{\mathrm{S}}(t) & \sim & \texttt{BINOMIAL}[R(t)p_{\text{RS}}] \\ S(t+1) & = & S(t) - \hat S_{\mathrm{I}}(t) + \hat R_{\mathrm{S}}(t) \quad S(0)=N_{0}-1 \\ I(t+1) & = & I(t) -\hat I_{\mathrm{R}}(t) + \hat S_{\mathrm{I}}(t) \quad \ \ I(0)=1 \\ R(t+1) & = & R(t) -\hat R_{\mathrm{S}}(t) + \hat I_{\mathrm{R}}(t) \quad R(0)=0 \end{array}$$ (15)

SIRS+D stochastic formulation

The discrete-time and stochastic models given by Eqs. 13 and 15 do not include disease-induced mortality (aka to mathematical epidemiologists as virulence). Thus they are only useful for considering the start or initial growth of epidemics or epidemics where disease-induced mortality is inconsequential. Including deaths requires consideration of competing rates/risk for individuals leaving particular disease classes. For example when deaths are considered individuals leave class I to either recover (R) or die (D). In this case a competing rates formulation (Table 2) is needed to simulate outcomes. In particular in the SIRS+D continuous-time model (Eq. 5) the prevalence equation (I(t)) involves the competing rates of recovery (ρ IR ) and disease-induced mortality (ρ ID ). Thus applying a competing rates formula we obtain (Table 2 Eq. 2.3 with Δt=1)

$$p_{\text{IX}}=\frac{\rho_{\text{IX}}}{\rho_{\text{IR}}+\rho_{\text{ID}}}\left(1-e^{-(\rho_{\text{IR}}+\rho_{\text{ID}})} \right) \ \ \text{X = R and D}$$ (16)

Since individuals in the prevalence class I are now faced with two possibilities of where to go—i.e. recover or die—the stochastic version of the model requires that the binomial drawing be replaced with a multinomomial drawing that depends on the two probabilities p IR and p ID . This requires that we use a multinomial function that in general for the case of n−1 leaving options with competing probabilities p i  i=1...n−1 and not to move at all with probability \(p_{n}=\left (1-\sum _{i=1}^{n-1}p_{i}\right) \ge 0\). We use the following convention to specify the values obtained in one such multinomial sampling:

$$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} \left(\hat X_{1}...\hat X_{n-1} \right) & \sim & \texttt{MULTINOMIAL}[X;p_{1}\cdotsp_{n-1}] \\ \text{noting that} \ \ \hat X_{n} & = & X - \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n-1} \hat X_{i} \ \ \text{and recalling that} \ \ p_{n}=\left(1-\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n-1}p_{i}\right) \ge 0 \end{array}$$ (17)

Thus the model is now given by (cf. Eq 15)

$$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} && {\text{SIRS+D stochastic model}} \\ \hat S_{\mathrm{I}}(t) & \sim & \texttt{BINOMIAL}[S(t)p_{\text{SI}}] \\ \left(\hat I_{\mathrm{R}}(t) \hat I_{\mathrm{D}}(t)\right) & \sim & \texttt{MULTINOMIAL}[I(t);p_{\text{IR}}p_{\text{ID}}] \\ \hat R_{\mathrm{S}}(t) & \sim & \texttt{BINOMIAL}[R(t)p_{\text{RS}}] \\ S(t+1) & = & S(t) - \hat S_{\mathrm{I}}(t) + \hat R_{\mathrm{S}}(t) \hspace{1.75cm} S(0)=N_{0}-1 \\ I(t+1) & = & I(t) -\hat I_{\mathrm{R}}(t) -\hat I_{\mathrm{D}}(t) + \hat S_{\mathrm{I}}(t) \qquad \ I(0)=1 \\ R(t+1) & = & R(t) -\hat R_{\mathrm{S}}(t) + \hat I_{\mathrm{R}}(t) \hspace{1.75cm} R(0)=0 \\ D(t+1) & = & D(t) + \hat I_{\mathrm{D}}(t) \hspace{2.85cm} D(0)=0 \end{array}$$ (18)

SIRS+DTV: including treatment and vaccination

We now add treatment (T) and vaccination (V) classes to our SIRS+D model and define

$$N(t) = S(t) + I(t) + R(t) + T(t) + V(t) \quad N(0)=N_{0}$$ (19)

For simplicity we assume that individuals under treatment are no longer able to transmit pathogens to the population at large—i.e. they are essentially completely quarantined. In reality however the situation is much more complicated than this: the ability of individuals under treatment to transmit pathogens depends on how strict the quarantine procedures are. In addition if we structure the population to include healthcare workers or members of the infected individuals household then clearly these healthcare workers and household members are likely to be at some particular risk of infection from individuals under treatment. Thus moving beyond our simplifying assumption of individuals under treatment being effectively completely quarantined requires additional model structure and transmission parameters which is not included in the model formulated here.

Deterministic formulation

The dynamic equations consist of the following system of 5 differential equations augmented by the three integrations that allow us to keep track of the accumulating deaths (D(t)) cases that are treated (Ttotal(t)) and individuals that are fully vaccinated (Vtotal(t))

$$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} && {\text{SIRS+DTV deterministic cont.-time model}} \\ \frac{dS}{dt} & = & \rho_{\text{RS}} R + \rho_{\text{VS}}V - (\rho_{\text{SI}} +\rho_{\text{SV}})S \quad S(0)=S_{0} \\ \frac{dI}{dt} & = & \rho_{\text{SI}} S - (\rho_{\text{IR}} + \rho_{\text{IT}} + \rho_{\text{ID}})I \qquad \ \ I(0)=I_{0} \\ \frac{dR}{dt} & = & \rho_{\text{IR}} I + \rho_{\text{TR}} T - (\rho_{\text{RS}} + \rho_{\text{RV}}) R \quad R(0)=R_{0} \\ \frac{dT}{dt} & = & \rho_{\text{IT}} I - (\rho_{\text{TR}} + \rho_{\text{TD}}) T \qquad \quad T(0)=T_{0} \\ \frac{dV}{dt} & = & \rho_{\text{SV}} S + \rho_{\text{RV}}R - \rho_{\text{VS}}V \qquad \quad V(0)=V_{0} \\ D(t) & = & \int_{0}^{t}\left(\rho_{\text{ID}} I(t) + \rho_{\text{TD}} T(t)\right) dt \\ T^{\text{total}}(t) & = & \int_{0}^{t} \rho_{\text{IT}} I(t) dt \\ V^{\text{total}}(t) & = & \int_{0}^{t} \left(\rho_{\text{SV}} S(t) + \rho_{\text{RV}} R(t)\right) dt \end{array}$$ (20)

For simplicity we will initially assume a constant treatment rate ρ IT =ρ treat that is implemented from the onset of the epidemic being modeled. However we will place a maximum Tmax on the number of individuals that can be in treatment at anyone time due to a limited capacity of the healthcare system to take care of sick individuals. Thus we have

$${\text{Treatment intervention}} \qquad \qquad \rho_{\text{IT}}(t)= \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \rho_{\text{treat}} & \quad \text{when } T(t) \le T^{\max} \\ 0 & \quad \text{otherwise} \end{array} \right.$$ (21)

This intervention however will be available to the user to elaborate through a RAM (runtime alternative module) that is the hallmark of our RAMP (runtime alterable model platform) technology. Equation 21 will be the Default formulation while alternative 1 will be constant application of ρ IT with not upper limit.

For the sake of completeness we note that since the outflow from I now includes both flows to R T and D the expression for R 0 in Eq. 11 while individuals in T and D are assumed not to transmit pathogen (note for disease such as Ebola pathogen is transmitted from individuals in D preparation of the corpses for burial [43]) now becomes

$$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} && {\text{Reproductive value}} {(\text{with quarantined treatment and disease-induce death})} \\ R_{0} & = & \frac{\kappa\beta}{\rho_{\text{IR}}+\rho_{\text{IT}}+\rho_{\text{ID}}} \end{array}$$ (22)

For simplicity we will initially assume a constant vaccination rate v that is implemented from time \(\phantom {\dot {i}\!}t_{\mathrm {V}_{\text {on}}}\) onwards. As with treatment we will place an upper bound on the number of vaccination regimens that can be administered where a vaccination regimen is defined to be a complete course that consists of one or more shots over a specified interval of time. Note for simplicity we assume that the full effect of the vaccination starts at the time of administering the first shot in the prescribed regimen (at which time the individual is transferred to V from S C L R or Q as the case may be). An individual that later transfers from R back to S may then receive a second regime in an ongoing vaccination rollout program. The vaccination rate v itself will be available to the user to elaborate through our Vacc RAM (runtime alternative module). Thus our default vaccination rollout program is defined by

$$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} {\text{Vaccination rollout}}&& \\ \rho_{\text{XV}}(t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} v & \quad \text{for}\ t_{\mathrm{V}_{\text{on}}} \ge t\ \text{and}\ V^{\text{total}}\le V^{\text{max}}\  \text{X = S C L R and Q} \\ 0 & \quad \text{otherwise} \end{array} \right. \end{array}$$ (23)

This function will be alternative 1 of the Vacc RAM of our RAMP.

Stochastic formulation

For each time step in the stochastic simulation (t=012...t fnl −1) we need to transform all the rates ρ XY (t) (used in the continuous-time formulation) to probabilities p XY (t) using the rates to proportions transformation Eq. 2.2 in Table 2. We then proceed at each time step to use these probabilities in the Monte Carlo drawings followed by computing next values using the updating equations as specified below:

$$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} && {\text{SIRS+DTV stochastic model}} \\ \left(\hat S_{\mathrm{I}}(t)\hat S_{\mathrm{V}}(t)\right) & \sim & \texttt{MULTINOMIAL}[S(t);p_{\text{SI}}(t)p_{\text{SV}}(t)] \\ \left(\hat I_{\mathrm{R}}(t) \hat I_{\mathrm{T}}(t) \hat I_{\mathrm{D}}(t)\right) & \sim & \texttt{MULTINOMIAL}[I(t);p_{\text{IR}}(t)p_{\text{IT}}(t)p_{\text{ID}}(t)] \\ \left(\hat R_{\mathrm{S}}(t) \hat R_{\mathrm{V}}(t)\right) & \sim & \texttt{MULTINOMIAL}[R(t);p_{\text{RS}}(t)p_{\text{RV}}(t)] \\ \left(\hat T_{\mathrm{R}}(t) \hat T_{\mathrm{D}}(t)\right) & \sim & \texttt{MULTINOMIAL}[T(t);p_{\text{TR}}(t)p_{\text{TD}}(t)] \\ \hat V_{\mathrm{S}}(t) & \sim & \texttt{BINOMIAL}[V(t)p_{\text{VS}}(t)] \\ S(t+1) & = & S(t) - \hat S_{\mathrm{I}}(t)- \hat S_{\mathrm{V}}(t) + \hat R_{\mathrm{S}}(t) + \hat V_{\mathrm{S}}(t) \quad S(0)=N_{0}-1 \\ I(t+1) & = & I(t) -\hat I_{\mathrm{R}}(t) - \hat I_{\mathrm{T}}(t) - \hat I_{\mathrm{D}}(t) + \hat S_{\mathrm{I}}(t) \quad \ \ \ I(0)=1 \\ R(t+1) & = & R(t) -\hat R_{\mathrm{S}}(t) - \hat R_{\mathrm{V}}(t) + \hat I_{\mathrm{R}}(t) + \hat T_{\mathrm{R}}(t) \quad R(0)=0 \\ T(t+1) & = & T(t) - \hat T_{\mathrm{R}}(t)- \hat T_{\mathrm{D}}(t) + \hat I_{\mathrm{T}}(t) \qquad \qquad \ \ \ T(0)=0 \\ V(t+1) & = & V(t) - \hat V_{\mathrm{S}}(t) + \hat S_{\mathrm{V}}(t)+ \hat R_{\mathrm{V}}(t) \qquad \qquad \ V(0)=0 \\ D(t+1) & = & D(t) + \hat I_{\mathrm{D}}(t) + \hat T_{\mathrm{D}}(t) \qquad \qquad \qquad \quad \ \ \ D(0)=0 \\ T^{\text{total}}(t+1) & = & T^{\text{total}}(t) + \hat I_{\mathrm{T}}(t) \hspace{3cm} T^{\text{total}}(0)=0 \\ V^{\text{total}}(t+1) & = & V^{\text{total}}(t) + \hat S_{\mathrm{V}}(t) + \hat R_{\mathrm{V}}(t) \hspace{1.7cm} V^{\text{total}}(0)=0 \end{array}$$ (24)

Once the simulation is complete we will have generated time series for all the disease class variables X(t) t=0...t fnl  X=S I R T and V as well as an incidence time-series \(\hat S_{I}(t)\) and new deaths time-series \(\Delta D(t)=\hat I_{\mathrm {D}}(t) + \hat T_{\mathrm {D}}(t)\) over t=1...t fnl .

RAMP implementation

Here we provide a brief description of the structure and operation of our four RAMPs each of which is an HTML file the implements the reference models as a Numerus Model Builder RAMP application

SIRS_Det.xml implements the continuous-time deterministic model represented by Eq. 5 with ρ ID fixed at 0

SIRS_Sto.xml implements the discrete-time stochastic model represented by Eq. 15

SIRS+DTV_Det.xml implements the continuous-time deterministic model represented by Eq. 20

SIRS+DTV_Sto.xml implements the discrete-time stochastic model represented by Eq. 24

SIRS+DTV continuous-time deterministic and discrete-time stochastic RAMPs while the structure and operations of our simpler SIRS continuous-time deterministic and discrete-time stochastic RAMPs are just a subset of descriptions of the more complicated RAMPs once elements relating to death (D) treatment (T) and vaccination (V) processes are removed. The RAMPs are built with the Numerus Model Builder Designer (NMB Designer). Once built the NMB Designer is used to generate a RAMP as an HTML file with a user provided name. This file can then be read and implemented by using NMB Studio. This application is available for free at the Numerus Website (URL). The reader and the RAMP HTML files for the continuous-time deterministic and discrete-time stochastic SIRS+DTV RAMPs are available at our Numerus Model Builder Website where more information on using these RAMPs is available at the Numerus Website.

Deterministic RAMP dashboard

Once NMB Studio has been download from the Numerus Model Builder Website installed launched and the Continuous-time deterministic SIRS+DTV RAMP HTML file has been read in the dashboard depicted in Fig. 2 appears. It is used to load saved or reset parameter values for simulations initiate runs generate graphs and save simulation results in the form of CSV files. We note that every object on the dashboard (parameter sliders RAM rollers and graphs) has a string of three alphanumeric characters (which we refer to as airport codes) associated with it that is used in scripts to control parameter values select runtime alternative module (RAM) options and select among graphing options. The various dashboard windows and their functions are:

Fig. 2 The dashboard of the SIRS+DTV continuous time RAMP is depicted here with graphical results of a run made over the interval [070] using the set of values appearing in the windows of the 13 sliders available for manipulating 13 parameters (also see Table 1) in the model. Note that in the Epidemic Curves (EPC) graph the Dead_(D/N) button is in gray because this graph is switched off though the total number of deaths are plotted (blue curve) in the Accumulated Totals (ACT) graph. Note that the left control roller for Kappa (KAP) is in green because the Constant mode (roller value 1) for this RAM has been selected rather than the Default (which would be in blue and the roller value would be 0) which is the Adaptive Contact mode expressed in Eq. 10 (also see Fig. 4) Full size image

Top ribbon (from left to right)

Run length window Type in the length of the run and then press ‘enter’ on your keyboard

S access window button (S On) This window provides the user for a place to load a script written in Ramp Programming Language (RPL) or to write a de Novo script to control and make the current run (see Fig. 4).

RAM access button (Op On) This will open the window that allows the user to access the different runtime alternative modules (RAMs) where options are available to use alternative functional descriptions or enter a ’user-defined description’ of a key process in the model.

JavaScript window button (Op On) The user can open a window and either load in a script or write a JavaScript to control a run using the Airport codes to access variables and functions (See Fig. 7)

Reset button Use to clear graphs and data from previous run.

Single step button Each time this button is pressed the simulation will progress by one time step.

Run button After pressing reset to clear previous run data press this button to initiate a new run.

Run progress window In this window the progress of the computation is monitored by counting down in time from the length of simulation to 0 (i.e. end of simulation).

Main window (from left to right and top to bottom)

Parameter sliders Name (Airport Code mathematical symbol) Baseline contact rate (KP0 κ 0 ) This parameter in Eq. 10 is the contact rate at the start of the epidemic (i.e. κ (0)= κ 0 ). Contact rate scaling (KPS P κ ) This parameter in Eq. 10 is the prevalence (proportion of infectious individuals) at which the baseline contact rate is reduced by a half (i.e. κ ( t )= κ 0 /2 when I ( t )/ N ( t )= P κ ). Transmission parameter (BET β ) This parameter interpreted as the ‘force of infection’ appears in Eqs. 7 and 8 as seen in Eq. 12 when multiplied by the contact rate κ ( t ) essentially determines the probability of infection per contact. Recovery rate (RIR ρ I R ) This is the flow rate from the infectious to the immune disease class: it also is the inverse the infectious period (see Eq. 1.2 in Table 1). Loss-of-immunity rate (RRS ρ I R ≡ ρ I V ) These are the rates at which individuals return from disease classes R and V (for simplicity assumed equal in our model) to become susceptible again in disease class S. Their inverse is the period immunity remains effective (see Eq. 1.2 in Table 1). Disease induced death rate (RID ρ I D ) This parameter referred to as the virulence parameter α by mathematical ecologists specifies the per capita prevalence rate at which infected individuals die over time. Treat (TRT ρ t r e a t ) This parameter is the rate at which infectious individuals are placed under treatment provided the treatment capacity T max has not been exceeded (see Eq. 21 for details of how ρ IT is defined in terms of ρ treat and T max ). A key effect of treatment is to reduce the rate of contact of infectious individuals in class T compared with those in class I. In our model we assume that individuals in class T no longer transmit pathogens to susceptible individuals although in more complex models some transmission may occur particularly to healthcare workers (but this is assumed to be negligible in our formulation). Treatment capacity (TRC T max ) This parameter places a limit on how many individuals can be under treatment at any one time. When this level is reached then new patients are limited by the rate at which individuals leave treatment because of death or recovery. Treatment discharge rate (RTR ρ TR ) This is the rate at which individuals under treatment are released to join the immune class R. Death rate under treatment (RTD ρ TD ) This is the rate at which individuals under treatment die from the disease. This rate may be greater or less than the disease-induced death rate for individuals in disease class I—the former when only the most severe cases are treated and the latter when treatment is at least somewhat effective. Vaccination onset time (VOT \(\phantom {\dot {i}\!}t_{\mathrm {V}_{\text {on}}}\) ) This is the time that the vaccination rollout program begins on the interval [0 t fnl ] (i.e. it may be the start of the simulation or some way into the simulation). Vaccination regimens available (VAM V max ) This parameter sets an upper limit to the total number of vaccination regimens that can be administered (whether a regimen consists of one two or more shots in a defined space of time the number of regimens rather than shots are counted) Vaccination rate (VAR v ) This rate only applies for \(\phantom {\dot {i}\!}t\ge t_{\mathrm {V}_{\text {on}}}\) and as long as V max has not been reached.

RAMs Code name Descriptive name (Airport code mathematical symbol) in blue when default option is selected (roller value 0) and in green when an alternative value is selected (roller value 1 corresponds to constant values over the simulation interval roller values > 1 will be user supplied options; text in red if the reset button needs to be toggled) Kappa Adaptive Contact (KAP κ ( t )) The Default (roller 0) for this expression as given by Eq. 10 involves the baseline contact rate κ 0  the contact rate scaling constant P κ and the transmission parameter β . Alternate roller 1 labeled Constant is the constant value κ 0 . Treat_Rate Treatment Flow Rate (RIT ρ IT ) The Default (roller 0) for this expression as given by Eq. 21 involves the baseline treatment rate ρ treat and the treatment capacity parameter T max . Alternate roller 1 labeled Constant is the constant value ρ treat . rSV Vaccinate S (RSV ρ SV ) The Default (roller 0) for this expression as given by Eq. 23 involves the baseline treatment rate v  treatment onset time \(\phantom {\dot {i}\!}t_{\mathrm {V}_{\text {on}}}\) and the treatment regimens available parameter V max . Alternate roller 1 labeled Constant is the constant value v . rRV Vaccinate R (RRV ρ RV ) The Default (roller 0) and alternative Constant (roller 0) as exactly the same as Vaccinate S. This option has been provided in case the user wants to vaccinate disease class R in a different manner to disease class S. This would require the classes R and S can be distinguished by the healthcare establishement.

Graphs Name (Airport code) Epidemic curves (EPC) This graph allows the user to plot the proportion of individuals in disease classes S I R and D over the chosen simulation interval or to select one of these four variables to create a comparative graph over multiple runs. Accumulated totals (ACT) This graph allows the user to plot the accumulating number of deaths ( D ( t )) vaccinated ( V total ( t )) and treated ( T total ( t )) individuals as time progress or to select one of these three variables to create a comparative graph over multiple runs. Epidemic progress (EPP) This graph allows the user to plot the effective reproductive rate ( R eff ( t )) or prevalence ( I ( t ) repeat of second graph in EPC) over time or to select one of these two variables to create a comparative graph over multiple runs.



Stochastic SIRS+DTV RAMP dashboard

As with the Continuous-time SIRS+DTV RAMP the latest available version of the Stochastic SIRS+DTV RAMP can be downloaded at our Numerus Model Builder Website where more information on using the RAMP is available. The dashboard of the Stochastic SIRS+DTV RAMP is the same as its continuous time counterpart except the dt window is now replaced as follows:

Seed window This window (center of top ribbon) anchors the sequence of pseudo random numbers used to in the simulation to a particular starting point: if this window is empty then the starting point is random otherwise it can be specified by a number ranging for 0 to 264−1.

There are also one additional slider in the stochastic dashboard

Parameter sliders Name (Airport Code mathematical symbol) Popsize (PSZ N 0 ) This parameter is the initial population size N 0 that appears in Eq. 24 where the initial number in disease class S is S (0)= N 0 −1.



The reason why population size does not appear in the Continuous-time SIRS+DTV RAMP is that the solution to continuous time model Eq. 20 is scale free relative to the size of N 0 (i.e. every equation in this model can be divided by N 0 to obtain a system of equations on the time course of the proportions S/N 0  I/N 0  R/N 0  T/N 0  and V/N 0  so that the equations are now independent of our choice of N 0  provided the initial conditions are set to the corresponding set of fractional values. On the other hand the variance associated with demographic stochasticity depends on absolute values (viz. the variance associate with multinomial sampling is inversely proportional to the square root of population size) which implies that the behavior of the initial outbreak is nearly (i.e. provided S(t)/N(t) remains very close to 1) independent of population size provided the transmission is purely frequency dependent (i.e does not have a density dependent component to it).

Every run of the stochastic RAMP for a given set of parameter values will be slightly different unless these runs are made with the same value inserted in the Seed slot in the middle of the top ribbon of the stochastic SIRS RAMP (Fig. 3). To make sure that the same seed is used at the start of a new run the Restart RNG on Reset square below the seed window can be checked. To answer many questions it is often likely to be more useful to make multiple runs and provide statistics related to quantities of interest than to make and present a single run. This idea will be further developed in the “Stochastic SIRS dynamics” section. In terms of visual interest repeated runs can be compared by selecting the Comparison mode slot above each graph and making sure that all by one of the graphs that can be plotted with each graph (see lists below each graph in Fig. 2 which can be selected or deselected by clicking on the appropriate small circular button. In the two graphs in Fig. 3A. the proportion of immune individuals and number of infectious individuals are plotted for 10 comparative runs for set of values indicated in the slider windows and in Table 3 when not available for slider selection.

Fig. 3 Ten comparative runs of the stochastic SIRS RAMP using the parameters values depicted by the sliders (or fixed according to values listed in Table 1). In panel A. the population size is 1000 in panel B. it is 10000 while in panel C. a vertically magnified version of prevalences for the three runs that failed to take off in panel A (Runs 6 7 and 9; such runs are expected as discussed in the Results Section in the context of Eq. 25) are plotted on their own Full size image

Operation of runtime alternative modules (RAMs)

The four RAMs all operate in the same manner. The Default modes (value 0 on roller selectors and text in blue) for the Adaptive Contact Treatment Flow Rate Vaccinate S and Vaccinate R modules are respectively coded by Eqs. 10 21 23 and again 23. Along with these a Constant alternative mode (value 1 on the roller selectors and text in green though text is in red when still to be included by pressing the reset button on the top ribbon of the Dashboard) is available for each of these. Information on these alternatives is provided in the window opened by toggling the Op On button second from the left on top ribbon of the dashboard (Fig. 2). This window (Fig. 4A.) allows the user to select the RAM of interest (bottom left hand list). Once selected (in Fig. 4A. for say the Adaptive Contact RAM the Default Kappa option is shown) the window provides an option to select the Default RAM (left text inner window contains general information; the right top text inner window contains specific information pertaining to the particular alternative selected; and the bottom right inner window contains the coded expression that will be used). Panel B Fig. 4B.) depicts selection of alternative 1 for the Kappa RAM along with the its specific information inner window and coding inner window. Next to the buttons to select the alternatives 0 and 1 is a “+” button (bottom of panel B Fig. 4) that users can be use to add as many alternatives numbered 2 3... etc. as desired.

Fig. 4 When the Op On button (second button from the left on the top strip of an SIRS+DTV RAMP as depicted in Fig. 2 is selected the window depicted here opens (panel A.). At the bottom left hand side we see that we have four RAMs (runtime alterable modules) options pertaining to the formulations of the functions Kappa (κ(t)) rIT (ρ IT ) rSV (ρ SV ) and rRV (ρ RV ). We also see that the Kappa RAM has been selected. The Default option (number 0) of this RAM is the adaptive form given by Eq. 10 (it appears in the window on the left of panel A. with some specific details pertaining to this mode provided in the window on the right of panel A.). Inset B. shows the alternate form (number 1) for κ(t) which is simply setting it equal to the constant κ 0 . The user may insert an additional alternate form for this RAM by selecting the ‘plus’ button bottom middle of panel B. and then adding the desired from in the Code window on the left-hand side Full size image

Scripting windows

Two types of scripting windows are available. The S On and JS On buttons (first and third buttons on top ribbon in Fig. 2) can be used to write or load in scripts respectively written in RPL (RAMP Programming Language; Fig. 5) or JavaScript. These scripts enable the user to control individual runs either by changing parameter values and RAM settings or make multiple runs (Fig. 4) and plot these using the comparative window facility (Fig. 6). Accessing the window in which this script can be entered or loaded from a saved file is described in Fig. 4’s legend as is accessing the window containing a list of the RPL commands that can be used to write such scripts.

Fig. 5 Here we depict three panels or windows associated with the scripting utilities of our RAMPs. Panel A (black bordered panel): When the S On button (first button from the left on the top strip of a RAMP as depicted in Fig. 2) is selected this window opens. In the bottom left corner of this window is a Command Reference button (covered here by panel C) when pressed opens panel B. Panel B (blue bordered panel): RPL Reference window containing a list of commands that can be used to automate multiple runs or make changes to component values or modes during runs. The second column of text in the Script window (panel A.) contains 17 lines of instructions (saved as MultiPrevScript.txt as seen in the top right hand window slot of the S On window) that codes the RAMP to make six repeated runs of the model where in each of the runs the value of KP0 (κ 0 ) is increased in value from 0.5 starting with the value specified in the model and described further in Fig. 6. Panel C (orange bordered panel): When the JS On button (third button from the left on the top strip of the RAMP as depicted in Fig. 2) is selected this window opens. Here we see the JavaScript equivalent of the RPL script given in panel A Full size image

Fig. 6 The script depicted in Fig. 5 is used to run the deterministic SIRS+DTV RAMP 6 times using the parameters values depicted by the sliders (or fixed according to values listed in Table 1). The KP0 (top left-hand) slider in this figure shows a value of 4.5 which implies the 6 runs ranged from a start value of 2.0 to 4.5 in increments of 0.5. Note that each of the three graphs available on the dashboard has only one its several possible options selected (available options can be seen below the graphs in Fig. 2) and the small rectangular comparison window above each graph has been selected to ensure that graphs generated during each of the 6 runs remain plotted once all runs are complete. The c Clear button above each graph allows earlier graphs to be erased when desired Full size image

Help file and airport codes

When the Help menu of a RAMP is selected information about the RAMP will appear together with a list of all the objects in the RAMP that can be referred to using airport codes (Fig. 7). In the parameter list on the left of Fig. 7) any parameter that has not been turned into a slider will have is Fixed Value listed in red. In our two SIRS RAMPs though not in the our two SIRS+DTV RAMPs the value of β (Airport code: BET) has been fixed 0.3 because only the product of κβ is relevant in determining the disease transmission rate ρ SI for a particular prevalence level I(t)/N(t) (Eq. 7). The value of this product is thus manipulated using the κ 0 slider because κ 0 scales the value of κ at time t as expressed in Eq. 10.

Fig. 7 When the Help menu of RAMPs is selected information about the RAMP is provided. Here we see the information provided about the stochastic SIRS+DTV RAMP. This information includes the airport codes for the parameters variables and graphs as well as descriptions associated with the sliders which can also be accessed by mousing over the relevant sliders on the Dashboard Full size image

Saving the data from each run

A file location can be set up for the automated saving of CSV files (see Fig. 8 for details) which is particularly useful when the RAMP is used to make a series of runs each differing in some sense (e.g. but changing a slider value and then rerunning the RAMP). The user can select what values should be saved using the CSV Settings... window. As indicated in Fig. 8 each file is saved with its own date stamp. Each CSV file is automatically headed with the set of parameter values and RAMP selections that were used to generate the data in the file.

Fig. 8 A. (black bordered panel) Each run can be saved at a user selected location that is set up using the pull down CSV menu on the top left-hand corner of the dashboard window (also see Fig. 2). B. (blue bordered panel) Once the CSV Settings option is selected a window opens that allows that user to select which disease states and computed time-series should be included in the CSV file which will be saved at the specified directory (example given here in the window at the bottom of the CSV Selection window. C. (orange bordered panel) Files saved in user specified directory are given a time and data stamp so that all files that are saved have a different name Full size image

Dabbling in grocery couponing might seem tedious and overwhelming but it’s a way to keep more money in your pocket when you venture to the grocery store.

You may also be relieved to know that collecting grocery coupons doesn’t have to become a hobby (or obsession) to save money. Below is a newbie guide to couponing to help you get started.

Grocery coupons: what they are and how they work

At a very basic level a coupon is a discount that shoppers can use to pay less for an item. In the world of grocery coupons these are the main coupon types:

Store coupons: Store coupons have to be redeemed at their corresponding store. For example you can only use a Giant or Kroger coupon at Giant or Kroger.

Store coupons have to be redeemed at their corresponding store. For example you can only use a Giant or Kroger coupon at Giant or Kroger. Manufacturer’s coupons: Manufacturer’s coupons come from the manufacturer and could be used in many different types of stores. For example a General Mills coupon could be used to buy General Mills products at any grocery store that accepts the coupon.

For example a General Mills coupon could be used to buy General Mills products at any grocery store that accepts the coupon. Catalina coupons: Catalina coupons are the coupons that print off of your receipt when you check out which could be manufacturer coupons and other store-related discounts.

Catalina coupons are the coupons that print off of your receipt when you check out which could be manufacturer coupons and other store-related discounts. Loyalty coupons: If you’re a member of a particular store you might get special coupons and discounts exclusively for members.

The discount opportunity of a coupon can vary. For example some coupons will give you a certain dollar amount off for buying one item or two items.

In other cases you may get to buy one item and a second one free. Reading the terms and conditions for each coupon could help you spot exclusions of items not covered by the discount.

Where to get coupons

We all know you can get coupons in the Sunday paper but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Shoppers can also get coupons online through sites like Coupons.com Redplum.com TheKrazyKouponLady.com and SmartSource.com.

For example Coupons.com features coupons that you can print or save. Plus you may be able to connect your store loyalty card to Coupons.com to add digital coupons.

This way you don’t have to print and keep the paper. Instead when you use your loyalty card at checkout the coupons on your loyalty card should automatically be applied.

Besides going to coupon websites that aggregate coupons you may be able to go directly to a grocery store’s site to find coupons. Below is a snapshot of what Harris Teeter has to offer.

Lastly manufacturers may have their own coupon and rewards sites. For example PepsiCo has its Tasty Rewards website where you can find offers on beverages and a wide range of PepsiCo food products such as Doritos Quaker Oats and more.

How to maximize coupons

Now this is where the magic happens. You may have seen episodes of reality TV shows where people are buying groceries and actually getting money back instead of paying for their large haul.

How do they do this? Here are a few ways:

Use multiple coupons on one item. Some retailers will let you use multiple coupons on one product and pairing a manufacturer's coupon with a store coupon could help you pay next to nothing for products. If the coupon equals more than the item's price you could even get a credit toward your bill.

Some retailers will let you use multiple coupons on one product and pairing a manufacturer's coupon with a store coupon could help you pay next to nothing for products. If the coupon equals more than the item's price you could even get a credit toward your bill. Use coupons on discounted products. If a store is running a special on an item whipping out a coupon for that product could help you pocket even more money.

If a store is running a special on an item whipping out a coupon for that product could help you pocket even more money. Some stores will double coupons. Sometimes stores will double the value of your coupons. For example if you have a coupon for 25 cents they'll bump up that value to 50 cents. The website Grocery Coupons Guide lists grocery stores in each state where you may be able to get double value. There's no mention on the list when the information is updated so you could use it as a starting point but you may need to confirm offers with the retailers mentioned.

Reading the fine print can help you avoid having your coupons denied at checkout when trying tactics like using multiple coupons at once.

And if your coupons get denied don’t worry—think of it as practice and get clarification on how you can use them next time.

Putting a coupon strategy into practice

Couponing can get overwhelming if you have a bunch of paper lying around that’s hard to find when you want to make a purchase. Here are a few tips that could help you start couponing with less stress:

Audit your pantry. Take note of the products and brands you buy so you can keep an eye out for relevant coupons and make a point to check out manufacturer websites for deals on brands you regularly use.

What if couponing isn’t for you?

Let’s face it—couponing isn’t for everyone. And if it’s not for you you can still save at the grocery store with other deal-finding strategies. Here are a few websites that offer money-saving offers that don’t involve clipping coupons.

That’s quite the lineup and every part of the skateboards are customized including the grips. These are high quality custom skateboards and they can be bought here for $249.99 each.

9. Kung Fu Tea X Kirby and the Forgotten Land bubble tea

Have you ever wondered what Kirby tastes like? Well now you can know with this crossover between Kirby and the Forgotten Land and Kung Fu Tea. This promotion has a special Kirby drink and bubble tea cups that feature Kirby’s face.

8. Cold Stone Creamery X Nintendo ice cream

Another sweet treat Cold Stone Creamery has teamed up with Nintendo multiple times over the years. This year’s promotion has began and it features ice cream combos from Kirby and the Forgotten Land Mario Party Superstars and Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Each have a specific flavor that coincide with the game featured and there is also a bonus ice cream cake that is themed after Mario Kart. To grab these delicious treats simply check out your local Cold Stone Creamery.

7. Oreo X Pokemon cookies

Many people may have heard about this crossover as there was a slight panic when it came out. These packs were flying off the shelf to find the rarest Pokemon in the Oreo collaboration: Mew. All the packs have randomized Pokemon on the cookies and the Mew Oreo was fetching high prices when it first released. Now the craze has blown over a bit but it’s still cool to eat Oreos featuring some of the greatest Pokemon in the series. Get them here.

6. Converse X Pokemon sneakers

What’s more iconic than Pokemon collaborating with some of the most recognizable shoes of all time? This collaboration spanned several different apparel items – but none were more amazing than the Pokemon prints on the Chuck Taylor All Stars. These prints featured Pikachu Mewtwo Charizard and Eevvee and they each had their Pokedex entry printed on them alongside exclusive color combos and patches. These can still be found through various sneaker retail stores and searching for them at your local shoe retailer may turn up a result.

5. Levis X Super Mario Bros. apparel

If you clicked on this article to score some sweet Nintendo drip look no further. Nintendo and Levi’s teamed up for Super Mario’s 35th anniversary and the results are amazing. This collection has everything from sweatshirts to jean jackets and of course some awesome Mario jeans (blue jeans and patterned). There are also overalls fanny packs shirts and really anything else you could need for your wardrobe. Quantities are limited but there has been some success finding this collaboration at local Levis stores and stock can be checked here.

4. Build-A-Bear Workshop X Nintendo stuffed animals

Stuffed animal lovers are in for a treat with this collaboration that Build-A-Bear created with Nintendo. This collection ranges from accessories for animals to actual Nintendo characters recreated as stuffed animals. There are characters from Animal Crossing and Super Mario that can be purchased here.

3. Kellogg’s X Super Mario and General Mills X Pokemon cereal

The Nintendo collaboration with Kellogg’s has a similar story to the Pokemon Oreos. When Super Mario Odyssey released Kellogg’s stocked shelves with this exclusive cereal that featured Mario icons as marshmallows and an amiibo chip in the box. It sold like wildfire and it was extremely hard to find. It’s a bit easier to find now but what’s even easier to purchase is the Pokemon cereal collaboration with General Mills. Called “Berry Bolts” this cereal also has shaped marshmallows and puffs that are fruity. They can be purchased from any major food retailer.

2. Puma X Mario and Animal Crossing apparel

If you need some shoes to go with your sweet Nintendo Levi’s clothing then this collection has you covered. Nintendo worked with Puma on exclusive shoes for Super Mario Bros. 35th anniversary and then did the same with Animal Crossing: New Horizons last year. The Super Mario collection has just shoes but the Animal Crossing variant contains all kinds of clothing items including shirts shoes pants and sweatshirts. Many of these items (including the Animal Crossing shoes) can be found at shoe retailers online still.

1. Lego X Nintendo Lego sets

This is a collaboration that makes so much sense that it seems like it should have been created long ago. LEGO and Nintendo are two household brands and Mario perfectly comes alive in these sets that LEGO released. They even feature an upgrade to the typical Lego set as the Super Mario characters electronic and they can even play levels on the creations. The NES system came out in addition to these electronic playsets and it features a more typical LEGO experience. Either way all of these sets showcase an amazing collaboration between two huge brands and they can be purchased from the LEGO Store here.

BMW’s recent move to charge car owners in several countries $18 per month to turn on the heated seats in their own vehicles sparked a public outcry with some would-be buyers calling the move a “dealbreaker.”

But it’s not just BMW: industry watchers and consumer advocates warn that the nickel-and-diming threatens to become standard as automakers chase a recurring revenue model pioneered by Elon Musk’s Tesla.

General Motors recently started requiring buyers of Buick GMC and Cadillac Escalade vehicles to pay $1500 for the mandatory “option” of buying three years of OnStar service which includes features like voice control and the ability to unlock vehicles from a mobile app. OnStar had previously been optional since GM introduced it in 1996.

Toyota meanwhile started charging $8 a month to remotely start vehicles using a key fob — a feature that had previously been free. Volkswagen Porsche and Audi lately have explored similar subscriptions.

It’s just the beginning industry experts say as manufacturers look to transform cars from simple goods for sale into bases for recurring revenue that could fill coffers for years or decades.

General Motors has told investors it aims to generate up to $25 billion in software and services subscription revenue annually by 2030 — up from an estimated $2 billion in 2021. Stellantis formerly known as Fiat Chrysler is shooting for $23 billion by 2030.

“Most automakers in the last couple of years have started talking about generating huge increases in revenue over the next decade primarily off the backs of software and other subscription services” Guidehouse Insights’ e-mobility analyst Sam Abuelsamid told The Post.

3 BMW fans have raged at the automaker charging for access to already-installed heated seats. Anadolu Agency via Getty Images

“The approach that these companies are taking so far is certainly not customer friendly” he added singling out GM’s mandatory OnStar as effectively a “bogus” and a “hidden price hike.”

The subscription push was pioneered by Tesla. Elon Musk’s electric automaker charges $9.99 per month to access music streaming satellite maps and other features. It also asks a whopping $200 per month or a $12000 one-time payment to access its experimental “Full Self-Driving” option.

On Sunday Musk announced on Twitter his company will hike the price of the FSD option by 25% to $15000 starting Sept. 5.

Abuelsamid said that other automakers are “fooling themselves” with their plans to juice revenue through subscription plans — and predicted they will run into consumers’ “subscription fatigue” a trend recently evidenced by Netflix bleeding about 1.2 million subscribers in the first half of 2022.

Just 25% of American car buyers say they would potentially be willing to pay extra for subscription car features according to a Cox Automotive survey from April.

BMW’s moves toward a subscription model which Abuelsamid called “particularly aggressive” have especially angered fans and would-be customers.

After news reports circulated in July about BMW’s $18-a-month heated seats charge in the United Kingdom Germany South Korea and other markets the luxury automaker was roundly roasted online.

One TikTok video with more than 24000 likes showed a BMW locking basic features like the speedometer and radio demanding cash for the renewal of a “premium membership.”

Another video with more than 160000 likes showed a BMW careening off a cliff with the caption “POV: new BMW owners after they forget to pay their monthly steering subscription.”

Safety concerns aren’t entirely a joke according to Consumer Reports’ associate director of safety policy Will Wallace. BMW currently requires car owners in some countries to pay roughly $12 per month to access a safety feature called “High Beam Assistant” which automatically turns off a car’s high beam lights when it senses another car to avoid blinding other drivers at night.

“Safety should come standard” Wallace said of adaptive headlights. “Some automakers might think that those are simply a convenience feature but there’s a demonstrated safety benefit.”

Both Wallace and Abuelsamid said the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration should require automakers to put adaptive headlights in every car just like airbags and seatbelts.

While luxury auto brands are taking the most flak for subscription features mass market automakers will increasingly embrace the strategy in the coming years predicts National Association of Consumer Advocates executive director Ira Rheingold.

“It will definitely work its way down market” Rheingold said of subscriptions. “There’s no way that this is not coming to your basic car.”

He compared the change to how airlines have increasingly hit consumers with fees for services that were previously free such as carry-on baggage and seat selection.

“Drip by drip people become more accepting of it” Rheingold said.

According to Reuters GM and LG Energy Solution are considering a site in New Carlisle Indiana. The joint venture had submitted a tax abatement application which is expected to be approved this month.

""Ultium Cells LLC ""is developing a competitive business case for a potential large investment that could be located in New Carlisle Indiana"" a spokeswoman said adding that Ultium had submitted a tax abatement application that it hopes will be approved later this month.""

The fourth Ultium Cells' factory most likely will be another large investment (potentially over $2 billion like the previous three plants) bringing a four-digit number of new jobs to the state.

Details remain unknown but we can assume that the manufacturing capacity might be at least 35-50 GWh with the potential for more.

Meanwhile the first Ultium Cells factory - in Lordstown Ohio - is expected to start production this month and is actively looking for more workers.

The plant in Spring Hill Tennessee is under construction (the main steel structure has been completed in June) while the site in Lansing Michigan announced in January is just starting construction.

With all plants online General Motors should easily exceed 100 GWh of annual lithium-ion battery cell production which will be crucial for the ramp-up of the Ultium-based electric vehicles.

GM's efforts to build battery plants might be supported by a loan granted by the federal government. In July the US Department of Energy (DOE) announced that intends to offer a $2.5 billion loan o Ultium Cells to help finance the construction of battery cell manufacturing plants in Ohio Tennessee and Michigan (see official details here).

Overall GM is gradually progressing on the electrification path. The company has a six-digit number of reservations for its all-new electric models (including 150000 Chevrolet Silverado EV and 80000 GMC Hummer EVs) and a growing number of new models launched or in the pipeline (like Cadillac Lyriq Chevrolet Blazer EV and Chevrolet Equinox EV to name just a few).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMjAvZ20tZm9yZC1hbmQtZG9kZ2UtZWxlY3RyaWMtbXVzY2xlLWNhcnMtZmFjZS1sYXRlc3QtZXYtdHJhbnNpdGlvbi10ZXN0Lmh0bWzSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMi8wOC8yMC9nbS1mb3JkLWFuZC1kb2RnZS1lbGVjdHJpYy1tdXNjbGUtY2Fycy1mYWNlLWxhdGVzdC1ldi10cmFuc2l0aW9uLXRlc3QuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Motor City meets a new test in the EV transition: Keeping gearheads behind the wheel,"Dodge CEO Tim Kuniskis unveils the Charger Daytona SRT electric muscle car concept on Aug. 17 2022 in Pontiac Mich. Michael Wayland / CNBC

PONTIAC Mich. – At an event featuring headbanging '80s music and $2 beers this week Dodge unveiled a concept for its first electric muscle car that included an exhaust system and multi-speed transmission. The features aren't needed for an electric vehicle − but could be key for winning over die-hard fans of performance vehicles. ""Sound is a critical component"" Dodge CEO Tim Kuniskis said. ""And the shifting is critical … we went round and round for the longest time. It does not make the car faster … but it's way more engaging and way more fun to drive."" As Detroit's legacy automakers race to work to transition to electric vehicles they're also trying to win over the long-time auto fans who love the sound of rumbling V-8 engines and the feel of shifting gears that gives them a visceral connection with cars. The sales heydays of muscle cars are decades in the past but the vehicles have become cultural touchstones that create massive awareness for brands and their customers remain loyal ambassadors. That hype can create a halo effect for other models that translates into sales.

In recent years Tesla has created a cult following for its EVs through its sleek tech-savvy vehicles and humming motors. But Detroit's Dodge Chevrolet and Ford brands have loyalty dating back family generations and the legacy automakers are still figuring out how to bring those enthusiasts along as they electrify their fleets.

Dodge shows its hand

Dodge this week became the first of Detroit's traditional performance brands to announce its plans on how to retain its muscle car customers. At the event in Pontiac Michigan the company showed off its Charger Daytona SRT concept ahead of its first production electric muscle car in 2024. Kuniskis called it one that regulators and environmentalists who support EVs ""don't want you to have"" because of its performance modernized retro styling and new patent-pending technologies. ""It was important to bring back something visually that they were going to look at and go holy s--- they did this right!"" Kuniskis told CNBC this week. Some design aspects of the concept car including an exhaust system and multi-speed transmission are expected to negatively impact the electric range of the vehicle – but Kuniskis said that's not something Dodge cares about. He said the point is to make the car feel and drive like a traditional muscle car.

That's critical for auto fans like Josh and Darla Welton who own several vehicles including the infamous Dodge Challenger SRT Demon which some condemned when it was produced because of its power as a street-legal drag racing car. ""To keep the enthusiast you're going to have to have the driver engaged as opposed to having some self-driving autonomous car"" said Josh Welton 44 who was wearing limited-edition ""SRT Demon"" sneakers that were made in partnership with Dodge and Warren Lotas. ""They want to be involved with what's going on."" Pete Seguin a 62-year-old auto technician from Ottawa Ontario was also at the event showing his support for Dodge's SRT Hellcat with an ""SRT"" and a Hellcat logo tattooed on his right forearm.

""I just liked it"" he said of the more than 700-horsepower cars. Still Seguin said he is very supportive of electric vehicles and interested in the Dodge concept car. Dodge confirmed at its events this week that it will discontinue its gas-powered Charger and Challenger muscle cars at the end of next year.

Ford Motor and General Motors have yet to disclose plans for their respective performance brands and vehicles. GM has confirmed it plans to produce hybrid and all-electric models of its famed Chevrolet Corvette sports car in the years to come but Detroit's largest automaker has been mum on the future of the Chevy Camaro which has experienced dwindling sales since a redesign of the vehicle in 2016. Performance enthusiast websites such as Muscle Cars & Trucks have said the company is expected to end production of the Camaro in 2024.

Ford is expected to reveal the next generation of its iconic Mustang car next month but it has not given any notion that the car will be electric as part of its strategy to electrify its ""most iconic nameplates."" Since 2020 Ford has offered an all-electric crossover called the Mustang Mach-E which is the only production vehicle other than the sports car to wear the company's prancing horse logo. ""Dodge really played to its own strengths with its concept"" said Paul Waatti manager of industry analysis at research firm AutoPacific. ""It will be interesting to see what Ford and GM have up their sleeves for this as well. I think Dodge has laid out a pretty good roadmap for these types of cars.""

He said a big challenge for automakers in the shift from today's muscle cars with rumbling V-8s and creating the same type of emotional connection. Representatives for GM and Ford declined to discuss plans beyond what has been announced.

Shrinking market

Sales of Detroit's mainstream performance cars are falling. The current cars enjoyed popularity after the Great Recession peaking at more than 394000 vehicles in 2015 according to industry researcher Edmunds. But sales have declined since including a nearly 50% drop for two-door coupes such as the Challenger Camaro and Mustang.

Many of the vehicles have evolved to offer smaller engines with less power but they can still carry a stigma as noisy gas-guzzling cars. There's also increased competition from automakers outside Detroit including EV makers; a move by consumers away from cars to more practical crossovers; and a potential change in performance culture. ""Performance has definitely felt like it's taken a backseat in recent times in this move to electric cars which have a different type of performance"" said Jessica Caldwell executive director of insights at Edmunds. Combined sales of the Ford Mustang Chevrolet Camaro and Corvette and Dodge Charger and Challenger were down about 35% last year compared with 2015. They were down by 25% from then in 2019 – the last year of pre-pandemic automaker sales before they were impacted by ongoing global supply chain problems including a shortage of semiconductor chips.

To keep attracting buyers Detroit automakers will need to ""find a niche and a brand image"" Caldwell said. Ford's Mustang Mach-E for example has done well for the automaker despite taking the form of a larger crossover rather than the sleek muscle car of its gas-powered predecessor. And Dodge's plans at least for now appear to have satisfied at least some of its most loyal fanbase with the Charger Daytona SRT concept. ""When it came rolling out and then you got to see all the lines in the body and design I got chills"" said Darla Welton 43. As a lifelong Detroiter whose family worked in the auto industry she noted the excitement of getting to witness the transition of the muscle cars like the Demon to EVs. ""I can't wait to get behind the wheel"" she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpbmFuY2lhbGV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2V4cHJlc3MtbW9iaWxpdHktbW9yZS1jb21wYW5pZXMtdGhyb3ctaGF0LWluLXRoZS1yaW5nLXRvLWJ1eS1nbS1pbmRpYS1wbGFudC0yNjM3ODk2L9IBgwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5maW5hbmNpYWxleHByZXNzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9leHByZXNzLW1vYmlsaXR5LW1vcmUtY29tcGFuaWVzLXRocm93LWhhdC1pbi10aGUtcmluZy10by1idXktZ20taW5kaWEtcGxhbnQtMjYzNzg5Ni9saXRlLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,More companies throw hat in the ring to buy GM India plant,"More companies could be joining the fray for acquiring General Motors’ car plant in Talegaon Pune.

General Motors and Mahindra Group have been exploring options for the sale of the site. GM’s $300-million deal with Chinese automotive company Great Wall Motors (GWM) for selling the Talegaon plant failed to secure regulatory approval from the Indian government because of a geopolitical tension with China. General Motors dropped the plans to sell the plant to GWM.

GM India did not confirm these developments or comment about potential sale. “GM is continuing to explore options for the sale of the site. The plant remains a well-maintained state-of-the-art industrial site with strong linkages into supply chain and transport networks” the company statement said.

GM had in January 2022 decided to halt manufacturing stop investing and close the Talegaon plant. The company has been working on the sale of the plant since January 2020. The company was also not able to conclude a separation package for the workforce and it has since then gone into litigation.

The GM plant in Talegaon is spread across 300 acres and has the capacity to produce 165000 vehicles and an engine plant to make 160000 engines. GWM had signed an MoU with the Maharashtra government for investing around $1 billion but this was put on hold in June 2020.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYXJzZ3VpZGUuY29tLmF1L2Nhci1uZXdzL2ZvcmQtdmVyc3VzLWdtLTIwMjMtc3R5bGUtdGhlLWFsbC1uZXctY2hldnJvbGV0LWNvbG9yYWRvLW1pZ2h0LWVuZC11cC1pbi1hdXN0cmFsaWEtc28taGVyZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford versus GM 2023 style!

Ether satisfies all three major criteria for a currency: store of value medium of exchange and unit of exchange. Any currency fits the bill as a payment unit if it fulfills the above three features of money. Store of value is an asset that retains its purchasing power in future. The value could be stable or increase over time but it won't go down. Risk aversion is a key concept behind a store of value and prices rise steadily if there is a perpetual demand for the asset. As a medium of exchange money serves as an instrument that facilitates the sale purchase or trade of goods or services between parties. For settling economic transactions currency is the most common medium of exchange. As a unit of account money should be divisible fungible and countable. Divisibility refers to the division of a unit of account into its component parts which equal the original value. Fungibility is the property where a unit of currency has the same value as any other unit. Ether scores well on all these parameters. ETH is a scarce digital money that is held and exchanged over a blockchain. Units of Ether can be used for measuring the value of goods and services and later for purchase. An individual can use Ethereum for investment purposes as well. They could buy ETH and hold it to redeem in future hoping for an increase in its value.

How to accept payment in Ethereum? Any merchant looking to accept payment in Ethereum needs to take certain steps. A merchant looking to receive payments in ETH needs to set up a payments infrastructure that facilitates transactions in an easy and convenient way. They can create a business account with a payment processor like BitPay Flexa or CoinRemitter and begin accepting ETH through their app. The process usually includes Sign up for a business account. Enter an Ethereum address. Create an API key. Add an integration method (API plugins invoices payment widget or a payment link) to checkout. Start accepting payment in Ethereum. Web infrastructure platform Cloudflare supports the deployment of Ethereum for taking payments through its Ethereum and IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) gateways. One can log into the dashboard and configure a zone for Ethereum. Cloudflare’s Ethereum Gateway enables users to read and access all information validated by the existing nodes on the blockchain without restrictions.

Where to store ETH? Merchants as well as users need a secure and convenient place to store ETH. Depending on factors such as security and convenience one could store ETH in hot or cold wallets. A “hot” cryptocurrency wallet is accessible online and facilitates transactions with the help of public and private keys. On the other hand a “cold” wallet also termed a hardware wallet is a physical item that keeps cryptocurrencies offline. Cold wallets are considered more secure than hot wallets while the latter are more convenient. Most people holding ETH tend to store it in hot wallets which are basically software programs capable of interacting with Ethereum blockchain. Hot wallets include desktop mobile and most exchange custody wallets. Though these wallets make transferring crypto easy they are vulnerable to hackers. For anyone holding ETH in large amounts keeping the bulk of their crypto in a cold wallet while keeping just enough in a hot wallet to execute regular transactions might be an ideal solution. Cold wallets not connected to the internet are at a lesser risk of being compromised compared to hot wallets. A USB drive device used for storing ETH and other cryptocurrencies stores a user's private keys. Anyone holding ETH could also keep it in custody through a paper wallet which they can generate on certain websites. A paper wallet has public as well as private keys regarding ETH on hold.

What are gas costs in Ethereum? Gas costs in Ethereum were exorbitant before the Merge with the Ethereum consensus layer. What has been the impact on gas costs? The concept of gas was introduced in Ethereum to compensate for the computing energy the ecosystem requires to process and validate transactions. All computing requirements for processing a transaction are sourced from miners and the gas fees associated with specific transactions is distributed among the miners involved in block formation. A gas limit indicates the maximum amount of gas one is willing to spend on a particular transaction. A higher gas limit means one needs to spend more to execute the transaction. The cost of gas goes up and down with the supply and demand for processing power. The EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) can execute a diverse kind of smart contracts including swaps options contracts coupon-paying bonds bets and wagers employment escrow and more. This enables businesses to collect funds in an automated manner without any human interference. Earlier gas costs in Ethereum shot up when demand was high often to exorbitant levels. After the introduction of the Ethereum consensus layer the issue eased up.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53b3JsZHdpbGRsaWZlLm9yZy9wYWdlcy90bnJjLWd1aWRlLWNvcnJ1cHRpb24tcmlza3MtYW5kLWFudGktY29ycnVwdGlvbi1yZXNwb25zZXMtaW4tc3VzdGFpbmFibGUtbGl2ZWxpaG9vZC1pbnRlcnZlbnRpb25z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TNRC Guide Corruption Risks and Anti-Corruption Responses in Sustainable Livelihood Interventions | Pages,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/tnrc-guide-corruption-risks-and-anti-corruption-responses-in-sustainable-livelihood-interventions on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53b3JsZHdpbGRsaWZlLm9yZy9wYWdlcy90bnJjLWd1aWRlLWNvcnJ1cHRpb24tcmlza3MtYW5kLWFudGktY29ycnVwdGlvbi1yZXNwb25zZXMtaW4tc3VzdGFpbmFibGUtbGl2ZWxpaG9vZC1pbnRlcnZlbnRpb25z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIyMDgyMTAwNTAyNC9lbi9FTUwtUmVwb3J0cy1SZWNvcmQtR0RWLU9mLTgwLjItQmlsbGlvbi1BbmQtUmV2ZW51ZXMtT2YtMjM0LjEtTWlsbGlvbi1Gb3ItRlkyMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EML Reports Record GDV Of $80.2 Billion And Revenues Of $234.1 Million For FY22,"BRISBANE Australia--(BUSINESS WIRE)--EML Payments Limited (ASX: EML) today released its FY22 Financial Results and Annual Report.

Today’s result demonstrates the substantial growth opportunities across both EML's global markets and its range of payments solutions and services. However the respective 4% and 1% lower underlying EBITDA and NPATA performance for FY22 underscore the importance of the Strategic Review (''Review'') to be driven by EML's newly appointed Managing Director and CEO Emma Shand.

Ms. Shand who commenced in the role in July this year will lead the Review through September and October with a particular focus on business growth strategy development of a more customer-centric streamlined and strengthened operating model including enhanced compliance and regulatory processes. The Board recognises that improvement is needed particularly in these aspects of the business to underpin reliable growth in both revenue and earnings for shareholders over the next three to five years.

Ms. Shand will present the outcomes of the Review to shareholders at EML's Annual General Meeting in late November this year.

Highlights for the year ended 30 June 2022 include:

Gross Debit Volume ('GDV') of $80.2 billion up 308% on PCP

GDV represents the volume processed by the Group through its proprietary processing platforms indicating demand for its payment services. In the year it saw both organic growth in all segments alongside acquisition growth as it consolidated the Sentenial Group into the Digital Payments segment from 1 October.

General Purpose Reloadable ('GPR') segment organically grew global volumes by 27% to $12.4 billion (PCP: $9.7 billion);

Gift & Incentive ('G&I') segment organically grew volumes by 21% to $1.3 billion as it recovered from the impacts of Covid-19 (PCP: $1.1 billion);

Digital Payments ('DP') segment grew volumes by 654% predominantly through the acquisition of Sentenial which was consolidated from 1 October 2021 to $66.6 billion (PCP: $8.8 billion);

Revenue of $234.1 million up 21% on PCP

The Group achieved record revenue of $234.1 million1 which is growth of 21% on the PCP. The Group benefitted from the introduction of new Account Maintenance Fees ('AMF') on certain European GPR programs where the account has been inactive for more than 12 months. This resulted in revenue of $23.5 million of new AMF income stream and $17.9 million of this is non-recurring related to the inactive cards' back book. Revenue came from:

GPR revenue grew 30% to $148.1 million benefitting from the new AMF revenue stream;

The G&I segment generated $68.4 million of revenue down 3%. This was a positive result noting that the prior comparable period included $11.1 million in elevated breakage rates in the North American business;

The DP segment increased revenue through the acquisition of Sentenial to $17.6 million up 71% on PCP. The Open Banking product Nuapay is strategically important and expected to demonstrate a strong growth profile over the next 10 years;

The Group generated a gross profit margin of 68% up 1% on the PCP

EML's Gross profit margins were 68% as the contribution of General Purpose Reloadable increased relative to the other segments with 57% of gross profit generated from the General Purpose Reloadable segment.

EML expects to benefit in the short to medium term from the expected continuation of interest rate increases by central banks generally. EML holds $2.2 billion in stored value (FY21 $2.1 billion) generating interest income. EML has been impacted by negative interest in Euro balances in the current and previous periods.

Underlying overheads increased 41% to $108.4m (PCP: $76.8 million)

Underlying overheads increased as the Company invested in its European operations to meet regulatory resourcing expectations. Consolidation of Sentenial overheads for 9 months from 30 September 2021 also contributed to this increase.

Underlying EBITDA $51.2 million2 down 4% on PCP

The Group has seen a reduction in underlying EBITDA of 4% to $51.2 million largely reflecting increased investment in EML's European operations.

Strategic Review

Over the six weeks since stepping in as MD and CEO Ms Shand has visited EML's global operations to get first-hand observations on the company's strengths and weaknesses as perceived by both long term and newly appointed management and staff members as well as customers shareholders business partners and importantly key regulators.

''My early conversations with key stakeholders have been very constructive and helpful in shaping my immediate focus. It validates to me that whilst we have a strong base it is time for a proactive strategic review of all aspects of the business'' Ms Shand said.

''From what I have already learned I am highly enthusiastic about EML's growth and value potential. However we won't successfully deliver improved value of those opportunities for our shareholders if we don't take a good hard look at how best to set our operating structure and align our capabilities systems and processes to execute effectively for growth.

We have already taken some early steps to improve operating focus elevate a culture of regulatory compliance to support sustainable growth and in optimising balance sheet strength.

I look forward to reporting the outcomes and initiatives from our strategic review to shareholders at the AGM in November'' Ms Shand said.

The retail landscape is undergoing a seismic shift largely propelled by technological advancements. The global pandemic and the ascent of eCommerce have only intensified the influence of technology. Retailers have leveraged technology innovations to enhance efficiency while remaining steadfast in their commitment to customer centricity. The result? Total experiences that delight both customers and employees.

However the retail journey doesn't stop here. The evolution of customer behavior and technology continues unabated. Retailers are mandated to stay attuned to this evolution to stay ahead of the curve in terms of sales and customer satisfaction.

The future of retail is poised to ride the technology wave further bridging the physical and digital realms. Retailers are looking beyond mere product sales on shelves aspiring to build comprehensive ecosystems that encompass services spanning health finance entertainment and more capitalizing on digitization and technology's ability to offer enhanced accessibility to consumers. In this era of technological transformation barriers between industries are blurring enabling retailers and other operators to seize opportunities rapidly by engaging directly with consumers.

Some of the technologies that are scripting this transformation and will continue to do so in the future are Artificial Intelligence (AI) Augmented Reality (AR) Virtual Reality (VR) Blockchain Internet of Things (IoT) and others. These multifaceted technologies promise to revolutionize both physical and virtual operations and reshape customer relations. Let’s take a closer look at these modern-day technologies that will undoubtedly shape the future of retail catering to a digital-first digital-only consumer base.

Generative Artificial Intelligence will Drive Customer Benevolence

The ability of Generative AI to work with Large Language Models applying in-context learning to learn from analogy and generate responses based on enhanced understanding of context improved reasoning inference skills and tailored problem-solving capabilities has come out as a potent force for businesses.

Generative AI is a powerful technology that leverages vast datasets to create personalized experiences and optimize various aspects of retail operations. It's not limited to one area but offers multiple benefits across different functions. In content creation and optimization Gen AI autonomously generates and improves product descriptions and copy reducing the need for extensive human involvement. It also excels at providing personalized discounts by analyzing purchase history.

Gen AI extends its capabilities to customer interactions through the development of intelligent bots. These bots go beyond traditional AI bots by generating relevant responses in various formats such as text and visuals based on real-time data. They are efficient in handling customer inquiries and can identify upselling and cross-selling opportunities.

In the context of inventory management Gen AI analyzes multiple data sources including consumer sentiment and competitor data to predict demand accurately. This helps retailers drive sustainability by optimizing supply and delivery preventing inventory deficits and avoiding wastage.

In the instance of supply chain management Gen AI can assist with product configuration in transport ensuring the best possible use of space and safe handling of goods apart from suggesting the most viable transport routes. This ability to optimize the operational aspect of logistics not just saves costs but also augurs well for sustainability reducing carbon footprints and ensuring minimum wastage of perishable and high-value goods.

Gen AI's real-time capabilities also extend to pricing optimization where it can adjust prices based on competitor pricing demand trends and market conditions.

Gen AI can also play a crucial role in fraud detection by identifying counterfeit products unauthorized sellers and fraudulent activities helping retailers save valuable resources and drive sustainability. Similarly the technology can be utilized for product and packaging design optimization reducing material use and encouraging recyclable materials.

The versatility of the technology is already a talking point among retailers around the globe with 92% planning to ramp up their investments in Generative AI as per a GlobalNewswire release.

Immersive Reality will No Longer be a Novelty

Retailers bet big on experience as a major differentiator and try using technology to drive experience as a differentiator. The evolution of Augmented Reality (AR) Virtual Reality (VR) and Mixed Reality has thrown open a new paradigm in experience that seamlessly marries the physical with the virtual. The ability to experience furniture fashion and more from the comfort of the drawing room is a relatively new experience one that customers are eagerly absorbing and consuming. According to a survey by PWC India China and Qatar are most keen on VR. The survey states that 32% of users buy products after checking them out on VR platforms. A similar report on AR from NielsenIQ highlights that 56% of customers feel more confident about the product using AR while 61% said they prefer to shop with retailers offering AR experiences.

AR/VR and MR empower retailers to:

The evolving wave of spatial computing that utilizes a range of technologies including AI ML AR and IoT to establish an awareness of the three-dimensional (3D) environment surrounding an object enable it to interact seamlessly with its surroundings is a fast-developing technology poised to take the experience quotient to another level and promise an immersive engaging future for retail consumers and better returns for retailers. The growing influence of immersive technologies is charting the way for retailers into the evolutionary world of the Metaverse. Retail giants like Nike Gucci and Adidas among others have already made a foray into the virtual world by buying real estate building digital stores conducting fashion shows and hosting concerts. The future state of this space holds a lot of promise for retailers as it is expected to create a digital connection between the customer and the brand like never before. Retail brands are excited about the opportunity as it provides them with direct access to zero-party data of customers enabling retailers and service providers to establish a hyper-personalized connection with the customers. The customer is enthusiastic and buoyed by the surreal experience that is being rendered across these new digital platforms which promises to better all previous experiences from the past.

Expanding the Expanse with Omnichannel Integration

Powering the futuristic omnichannel retail ecosystem at the front end will be a headless commerce architecture that delivers a distinctive consistent customer experience across channels and supports all touchpoints with shared functionalities such as wish lists appointment booking and payments. This architecture is also expected to be more scalable and flexible than a traditional monolithic architecture as it is decoupled from the backend giving retailers the ability to drive changes faster. The world is steadfastly embracing IoT in the shape of wearables home automation and more. The headless architecture will help retailers deliver content across each device type without reinventing the wheel keeping the experience consistent. Talking of the backend the move towards a microservices-based architecture at the backend can also be a game changer for retailers. This decoupling of the monolithic architecture at the backend will help retailers to upgrade or revamp a specific function quickly for example integrating biometrics into the sign-in function or integrating gesture recognition for payment. These new-age capabilities can be separately developed and deployed in a modular fashion. This is unlike how it is done in the traditional monolithic architecture where the complete system would need a revamp for the addition of any functionality.

Blockchain Safeguarding Digital Assets Across the Virtual Terrain

Blockchain technology is a decentralized ledger system that provides robust security and transparency for safeguarding digital assets in the retail sector across the digital landscape. Through its immutable and distributed nature blockchain ensures the integrity of transactions and data reducing fraud and enhancing trust. For example in supply chain management blockchain can trace the origin and journey of products allowing customers to verify the authenticity and quality of goods. It also acts as a powerful tool for driving sustainability within the retail sector by providing retailers insight into their supply chains promoting responsible sourcing and reducing waste. By verifying product authenticity blockchain helps combat counterfeiting ensuring that consumers receive genuine quality products discouraging the production of environmentally damaging fakes.

In e-commerce blockchain-based payment systems like Bitcoin offer secure and borderless transactions eliminating the need for intermediaries. Blockchain can also be a game changer in driving loyalty programs enabling retailers to offer customers rewards securely while smart contracts an agreement based on blockchain technology that kicks in automatically once certain conditions are met can enforce credible transparent agreements on product authenticity warranties or refund policies ensuring a seamless and trust-driven retail experience. Blockchain holds significant value in a rapidly digitizing world that is embracing Non-Fungible Tokens or unique digital identifiers recorded on a blockchain ledger as an identification of ownership and authenticity for digital assets such as art music fashion or any other collectible owned by an entity. One of the main advantages of NFTs is that they allow people to own and intellectual property. NFT cannot be replicated a strong reason why fashion labels and multinational retail conglomerates are exploring the use of NFTs to secure ownership of digital assets and thwart counterfeiting.

Embracing the Future of Retail Technology Today

As inflation and fears of an economic slowdown weigh heavy on the minds of consumers curtailing their spending retailers will need to embrace the advances in technology to attract convince and drive sales to build an all-encompassing retail ecosystem. Retailers will need to deploy new-age strategies powered by contemporary technologies such as artificial intelligence blockchain augmented and virtual reality and more to get up close and personal with their customers building long-lasting trust and value. Retailers will have to look at technology not just for delivering convenience and experience but also as a medium to drive sustainability and security. The time is ripe for retailers to embrace the future of technology to catapult from digital transformation to digital ascendance.

The opening “Bad Romance” found the singer encapsulated within what seemed to be a combination of a fitted cloak a cocoon and a sarcophagus. She did almost nothing beyond creeping her arms out at odd angles as a phalanx of dancers scurried below her and she still commanded focus with impossible ease.

Lady Gaga doesn’t have to prove anything to anyone. In a decade and a half she’s proven her hand at club pop the Great American Songbook and singer/songwriter confessionals and shown her mastery of image creation and provocation before stripping back down to the basics in “A Star Is Born” all while laying claim to the weirdos art nerds and queer kids of the world. So what’s left for her to conquer? If Friday’s sold-out Chromatica Ball Tour date at Fenway Park didn’t offer any easy answers it certainly showed one of this century’s greatest pop stars flexing her muscles after four years and several pandemic-fueled false starts.

Unafraid of making herself grotesque for effect she took on the persona of an imperious extraterrestrial queen and snarled her way through “Just Dance.” The house throb that has fueled much of her most recent material generated an insistent undertow that amplified her power even when she was lying on a concrete slab tilted at 45 degrees like a mad scientist’s monster for “Alice.”

She was so tightly wrapped in her ferocious stage persona in fact that when she called out her band at the very end of Act II of her four-act show it was the first time all night that she presented as recognizably human. By the time she reached a satellite stage in the middle of the field for Act IV the façade had dropped as much as it ever would. She was still Gaga naturally going avant-garde — wearing futuristic harlequin garb while playing at a piano molded into twisted surrealistic sculpture — for her most vulnerable material like “Shallow” and “Always Remember Us This Way.”

The latter song very possibly the great lost Lady Gaga power ballad was built on sympathetic (rather than forced) unity the theme that made her Mother Monster to her fans in the first place. And the spell of that a free-time cabaret-styled “Born This Way” and a solo “The Edge of Glory” dedicated to everyone affected by the constricting of reproductive rights carried over even through the warbling synth-house jam of “Fun Tonight” and electro-dance rush of “Stupid Love” back on the main stage. Gaga closed with her airplane-movie song “Hold My Hand” over the top in exactly the right rock-ballad ways as she dropped to her knees and shredded herself to bits on the floor. Then she headed to the exit paused to do a Michael Jackson kick and spin and vanished.

Both publications believe in its importance to the university community.

Henry Larson CU Independent Editor-in-Chief

Tami Gottsegen doesn’t come to Boulder anymore. The 45-minute northwest drive from Centennial is too painful: it is where her son Braden Burks 24 attended the University of Colorado. It was a place of hope and promise for Tami until her son’s life was taken from him by a counterfeit pill.

Braden was a true Colorado native: a strongly devoted Broncos fan glued to his television on Sundays an avid skier namely at Breckenridge Keystone and Winter Park and in-state college student who studied at Leeds School of Business.

“Living in Winter Park as a child he learned how to ski when he was still in diapers” Gottsegen said. “As soon as he could walk he was skiing.”

He grew up in a tight-knit blended family and was one of six siblings. His stepsister Tori Bridges describes her bond with Braden as twin-like. Bridges describes her brother as popular and well-respected by peers a magnetic personality that acted as a glue in his many friendships.

When Braden moved to Denver in 2017 he was beginning a new chapter in his life.

On Jan. 10 2019 Braden had two friends over to watch a NCAA men’s basketball game. Watching sports and participating in them connected Braden and his friends in shared interests and passions. But after Braden’s friends left his night was different than most – he decided to buy a pill from a high school acquaintance.

Throughout his life Braden struggled with chronic sleep issues even trying weighted blankets melatonin and other options to improve sleep quality but could not find restitute. Gottsegen said she believes the reason he bought the pill was to get sleep but what Braden thought was oxycodone was disguised. It was a counterfeit pill containing illicit fentanyl.

Braden’s brother found him unconscious the following afternoon at his condo after Gottsegen worried about not being able to get ahold of him. By the time EMTs arrived too much time had passed for the medics to revive Braden with the only drug able to reverse opioid overdose Narcan.

Defining Fentanyl

Fentanyl is a Schedule II narcotic a synthetic opioid first used medically in the 1960s typically used to treat patients with severe pain particularly cancer patients. It is also used to treat patients with chronic pain who are not physically tolerant to other opioids because it is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. In recent years it has become a dominant painkiller for doctors but also a scourge in communities as black-market cooks realize easy profits can be made because a small amount goes a long way.

Fentanyl is now disguised in street substances such as powders capsules and pressed pills. It is Colorado’s leading cause of drug deaths.

According to Kirk Bol the manager of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment’s Vital Statistics Program at least 912 drug deaths in Colorado in 2021 involved fentanyl. Drug poisonings by fentanyl have increased over 2000% since 2015 when only 41 Coloradans died of the substance.

Such poisoning occurs when a person intends to take an ill-gotten drug as Braden did but is sold fentanyl under the guise of the requested drug also known as a counterfeit pill.

Buyers often assume they are purchasing a generic pharmaceutical pill but the reality is the pill is unregulated. Counterfeit pills are made to look reliable like prescription opioids such as oxycodone (Oxycontin Percocet) hydrocodone (Vicodin) and alprazolam (Xanax); or stimulants like amphetamines (Adderall). Fake pills are easily accessible and often sold on social media and e-commerce platforms.

For American youth especially young adults on college campuses the culture of drugs and accessibility to experiment or self-medicate is prevalent. In conjunction with social pressures and the COVID-19 lockdown leading to intense periods of isolation data from the National Institute on Drug Abuse indicates there have been large increases in many kinds of drug use in the United States since the national emergency was declared in March 2020.

“Fentanyl has nothing to do with being a drug addict” Wil Lemon Braden’s childhood best friend said. “This has nothing to do with being so dependent on a pill that you must take too much of it to the point you die. That is what you call overdose. This is totally different. Braden wasn’t addicted to pills. He wasn’t dependent mentally physically on anything. He one night trusted someone and decided to take a pill and it killed him.”

Though fentanyl is often abused by those struggling with addiction this narcotic has also seeped into distribution chains for first-time and recreational users who are unable to survive its potency. Only two milligrams of fentanyl – roughly the size of Abraham Lincoln’s ear on the penny – can be lethal.

Lemon described the months after his best friend’s death as gray that “every day was gray.”

Accidental overdose or poisoning?

Language is essential in combating this crisis said Alden and Susan Globe who lost their daughter Madeline on the night of Aug. 10 2017. Madeline was about to enter her senior year at CU Boulder studying communication.

The Globes had a very special relationship with Madeline. Susan Globe called her daughter a miracle baby because she was their only child and born later in her parent’s lives. “She had a curiosity and love and passion and compassion for the universe” Susan Globe said.

“It is another reason why the loss was so devastating” Alden Globe said. “She was so smart. Funny. She loved her life.”

Family and friends say Madeline was a global thinker with an ardent sense of global justice. She was very concerned about the environment. From a young age she opposed the practices at SeaWorld and while her friends would say “we love Sea World” documentaries like “Blackfish” solidified her point further. She was drawn to beautiful things which may explain her post-graduate plans to become an interior designer.

Madeline and her parents loved traveling and skiing together. Her parents were proud of her for studying abroad in Aix-en-Provence a city in southern France stepping out of her comfort zone and immersing herself in new cultures.

“To show the irony of the situation the whole time she was there we worried about terrorism attacks kidnapping drugging and everything. Nothing happened she had the greatest time” Alden Globe said.

She died two months after coming home—a place Alden Globe considered safe for his daughter a state she had known her entire life and a city she cherished.

“I’m still so baffled” Susan Globe said because Madeline had no history of drug use. She was considered the responsible one or “mom” in her friend group. So when the police said Madeline died from mixing Xanax and alcohol that information didn’t seem feasible said Alden Globe.

Four months later the toxicology report confirmed the pill contained fentanyl.

The last memory Susan Globe shares with her daughter remains vivid: the construction of a new bed frame an antique piece of furniture from Madeline’s maternal grandmother. With refined taste and a desire to pursue interior design after college the antique was old-fashioned and idyllic. But in the middle of building the bed frame one of the legs collapsed and in college-style DIY duct-tape ensued. It was a moment in moving where the exhaustion asks for tears but gives laughter instead. It was a vivid memory only days before Madeline was poisoned. In the days and months following her death emotions of shock and disbelief arose.

Even now five years later those feelings still exist for the Globes.

“We still don’t know exactly what happened” Susan Globe said about the night of her daughter’s death.

Her parents don’t know what house party she went to on University Hill or if she went out for drinks at a bar or what friends she was with. They were forced to reconstruct Aug. 10 2017 through a series of accounts from CU students who testified law enforcement who investigated and other medical professionals in court.

Fentanyl deaths are typically labeled as accidental overdoses which by definition means taking more than the normal or recommended amount of a specific drug. But what if the person consuming the drug thought it was a legitimate pill and correct dosage and instead ends up taking a counterfeit drug?

The question remains contentious. When parents look at the death certificate labeled as accidental overdose many exclaim “my child didn’t have a drug problem.” Alden Globe said he questioned the diagnosis at the coroner’s office. The coroner explained medically it was a drug overdose and Alden Globe hesitantly accepted this information. But in the past year thinking this statement over seeing more deaths and speaking with other families who lost their kids to fentanyl Alden Globe no longer agrees with defining the deaths as accidental overdose. Since Madeline’s death in 2017 fentanyl poisoning has nearly doubled nationally from 30000 deaths to around 64000 in 2021 according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“The language and the training for coroners law enforcement and medical needs to be updated” Alden Globe said.

The common misconception—that fentanyl poisoning stems from the same issue as other drug abuse—harms users who may not realize the street drug they are buying from a dealer contains this lethal compound like Madeline and Braden.

“It is a poisoning” Susan Globe said. “They didn’t choose to die.”

Why is fentanyl being produced?

Criminal drug networks flood the U.S. with deadly fake pills because they are cheap to produce and highly addictive. Fentanyl commonly comes from Mexico where it is pressed into pill form and smuggled into the U.S. according to Special Agent in Charge Bill Bodner of the DEA Los Angeles Field Division who has been an agent for 30 years. Bodner has witnessed the surge in fentanyl first-hand and is aware of increased threat and patterns.

Older traditional drugs—marijuana cocaine and heroin—take extensive efforts to produce.

To produce heroin drug organizations must control large areas of land to grow the poppies and then have manual labor to score the poppy plants and scrape the gum off the plants. This process requires control of land and labor which is time consuming and expensive. In terms of a business it is difficult to scale heroin production.

Cocaine is primarily manufactured in South America and smuggled into Mexico through Central America—because smugglers deal with multiple government entities and borders and there is a lot of risk therefore they add an amount onto the price. It is bought in Mexico with an added surcharge.

And marijuana which used to be a drug that was a staple and profitable for cartels has been decreasing in profits after U.S. states began legalization. Marijuana seized at borders has dropped 80% since 2018 according to Bodner.

“One of the things people said is ‘it will deal a blow to the Mexican drug trafficking organizations if we legalize this drug’” Bodner said. “Unfortunately it didn’t really deal with a blow – it just caused them to look elsewhere for profit-making drugs.”

Therefore new profits could be obtained through producing methamphetamines and fentanyl which are synthetic drugs. Synthetic drugs do not require excessive plots of land or labor. If a producer has the right chemicals namely from China and India they only need a laboratory. It became a vertically integrated business model.

“I think a lot of it had to do with Covid-19” Bodner said. “Think about my business your business everyone’s business during Covid-19: it went through a bit of a digital revolution or an online revolution where everyone was teleworking.”

This period marked a shift in drug trafficking too and the accessibility of drugs shifted from a physical place to someone’s fingertips on a screen. Kathleen Miles who works for the Center on Illicit Networks and Transnational Organized Crime said to CBS News teenagers are two degrees of separation away from a drug dealer.

“Unless you are getting them from a physician or directly from a pharmacist it is a fake pill” Bodner said.

Party culture embedded within college life

Braden and Madeline were both members in Greek life. Braden was a Pi Kappa Phi and Madeline was a Pi Beta Phi. But along with the philanthropic work and team building Greek life also fosters a culture of partying including drinking and drug use according to 2016 CU Boulder alumus Brian Keesling.

Keesling was one of Braden’s closest friends since the second grade and they grew up skiing playing lacrosse and attending school together. Keesling remembers Braden as a “ridiculously funny” person who was always looking for a smile or laugh but also a loyal friend who would have deep meaningful conversations. When college arrived and they were on the same campus Braden pursued joining a fraternity while Keesling decided against it. The two remained best friends regardless of involvement in different social clubs but Keesling was exposed to an outsider’s perspective of Greek life – one of youthful mentalities where students seemed unaware or did not acknowledge the potential consequences when using substances.

Partying is not exclusive to only Greek life but is described as extremely prominent in such a social setting.

Keesling said “I don’t know what it is like at other colleges but I know CU has some pretty serious drug problems as a campus because it is normalized.”

More youths aren’t experimenting but rather the consequences have changed because of fentanyl’s potency and parents’ main concern is that one pill can kill.

“Back in 2017 we had never heard anything” Susan Globe said about the dangers of fentanyl. Susan Globe contacted CU after Madeline passed being connected with the former assistant dean of students and had several conversations. The dean expressed sorrow and asked to help however she could.

Today with the rise of fentanyl poisonings country-wide the university has tried to bring awareness said Kathryn Dailey associate director of health promotion at CU Boulder. Narcan is available for free at Wardenburg the on-campus pharmacy and in efforts to explain the deadliness of fentanyl before St. Patrick’s Day one of CU’s largest days to party a series of Instagram stories were posted and website links were sent to students’ emails. But parents still think the university is not doing enough to protect their students.

Within the Greek community sorority chapters are not required to hold Narcan in their houses.

“I personally don’t believe it is a clear problem within the chapter facilities” wrote the internal vice president Kallie Hayes of Panhellenic in an email.

Then again Hayes said that stocking the life saver Narcan “is a great idea. I can encourage risk officers to get some from Wardenburg.”

Moving forward Hayes said she will require each chapter to present a risk presentation to their chapter members before they host a formal which is a social-date event.

According to Michael Smith an advocate for Interfraternity Council on the Hill—the independent and non-university affiliated fraternity organization consisting of 20 fraternity chapters—each chapter has its own drug and alcohol policies. Therefore Narcan may be required by different national affiliations. At CU Boulder alone fraternities are required to abide by their 911 program. The program requires their members to call 911 if any symptoms of distress arise and they will receive protection under The Good Samaritan Law.

Advocacy groups strive to educate

Voices for Awareness Foundation led by Andrea Thomas and D’Ann Hopkins is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization based in Grand Junction working to bring awareness to communities regarding illicit drugs fentanyl and self-harm.

Thomas lost her 32-year-old daughter Ashley to fentanyl poisoning on June 11 2018. For years Ashley suffered from chronic pancreatitis and would often go into stays at the hospital receiving tramadol or oxycodone to subside the pain. Yet pain pills made her nauseous so she would only take half at a time. After losing private health insurance she went on Medicaid and when couldn’t receive a proper prescription any longer her boyfriend gave her what he believed was oxycodone. Ashley took half of the pill but it wasn’t regulated and contained fentanyl killing her almost instantly.

It is not easy to use a deceased child or sibling’s name pictures and experiences as an example Thomas said but it may be essential in protecting other young people unaware of counterfeit pills’ 40% chance of containing fentanyl.

“What’s kept me going is seeing the increase in people dying every day” Thomas said “And how could I stop now? It becomes more than my daughter.”

Thomas’s advocacy expands across all sectors of fentanyl—education supply reduction and legislation. The consistent principle in each advocacy lens is addressing stigma around death by fentanyl. Thomas explains it is not the typical drug user overdosing anymore nor is it the old paradigm drug dealer on the street corner. Dealers are now connected to users through smartphones and social media.

“These are not the drugs of five or ten years ago” Thomas said.

This is why Thomas along with Gottsegen and the Globes testified before Colorado lawmakers regarding anti-fentanyl legislation in the 2022 regular session.

Gaps in the justice system

“Justice is a long process” Gottsegen said.

For Braden’s case it took almost three years to get a federal prosecution. For other families legal action was never an option – law enforcement was unable to track down the dealer or district attorneys couldn’t prosecute because of the lack of statutes in Colorado – and for some it is ongoing.

“We were fortunate the police chose to follow up and begin an investigation in our case” Alden Globe said. “Not every parent who loses a child to fentanyl gets a follow-up call back.”

Today there is an effort to strengthen protocols around investigating fentanyl-related deaths: HB22-1326 – Fentanyl Accountability and Prevention which was signed into law by Gov. Jared Polis on May 25.

A month before the bill was signed a crowd of witnesses—supporters and opposers—filed into room 217 at the Colorado State Capitol at 1:30 p.m. on April 17 they prepared their 2-to 3-minute witness testimonies for the House committee. The families in the crowd came to realize they are not alone left angry and disoriented by fentanyl poisoning. Of those families included Andrea Thomas who was dressed in a black blazer with a t-shirt underneath with the words VOID a fentanyl-awareness organization based in California. VOID stands for Victims of Illicit Drugs. Tami Gottsegen filed into the second row facing the committee with her mother brother husband and stepdaughter. Susan Globe joined over Zoom.

As the room settled into silence and murmurs the House Speaker addressed the committee. The room was filled to its maximum capacity. Remnants of Covid-19 were visible as some noses and mouths were covered with polyester-blended or cotton masks. And with the heat of so many bodies and overflow in the halls the windows were cracked on the east side of the room allowing fresh air to flow. The three major paintings in the room reflected Colorado landscape and history leading to this moment. A moment where legal jargon fills the air while families wait to share their stories often shaking their heads in agreement or disagreement with opinions presented.

Andrea Thomas waited eight hours and 57 minutes to testify. Susan Globe waited 12 hours and 29 minutes. And Tami Gottsegen would have waited over 13 hours to testify if her family stayed past 3 a.m. but exhaustion and frustration overwhelmed.

After 12 hours of passionate discourse the motion passed.

“This bill is a huge step forward for holding accountable those who are pedaling this poison” District Attorney Brian Mason for Colorado’s 17th Judicial District which serves Adams and Broomfield counties said. “Right now in the state of Colorado we don’t have a distribution of fentanyl causing death statute. That means I as a prosecutor if I have someone who has distributed a drug with fentanyl in it that causes someone to die I can’t hold them accountable for that death. This bill will allow me to do that.”

Currently Mason’s district has the largest lethal incident in the U.S.—five adults died by fentanyl-laced cocaine on Feb. 20. Mason said this incident will likely not be the largest for long.

“No drug is safe right now” Mason said. “We are finding it in cocaine we are finding it in heroin we are finding it in meth we are finding it in oxycodone and in limited circumstances we’re even finding it in marijuana.”

HB22-1326 was one of the most controversial of the concluded session as the crisis involves an intensely intricate and detailed web of stakeholders extending beyond the dealer who is simply a middleman. But Sen. Cooke said this bill is the first step to crack down adding that sheriffs and law enforcement need new tools to hold dealers accountable and strengthen the political penalties for dealing fentanyl.

The new law heightened felony charges for possession of 1 to 4 grams of any substance containing fentanyl; harm reduction programs to help people treat their addictions including medication-assisted treatments in jails; access to education programs; widespread availability to Naloxone and testing trips; criminal investigations into deaths due to fentanyl; and continued tracking of deaths by fentanyl.

Although Gottsegen and Thomas don’t think the bill is strong enough especially as only 2 milligrams can be deadly they both said it is a step in the right direction to save lives.

Healing after loss

For Gottsegen and the Globes going to court hearing a verdict and putting the dealer in prison is only a part of progress. The complex process may serve justice but does not holistically heal because families and friends will never forget their lost ones’ impact. They now notice the empty chair at the dinner table; they now have an aching over holidays and anniversaries.

Within each story of loss to fentanyl parents express a desire to protect each of their kids and tell their story. Their children are no longer here to defend their legacy— it has fallen to their families to educate others while simultaneously grieving the life most essential to theirs.

“You never get over grief but you can learn to move forward with it” Alden Globe said. “There is a hole in your heart now and it will never get smaller but you can work to make your heart bigger. And how do you do that? By honoring the memory of your lost one and by trying to help other people.”

After all an entire Goldman floor was a lactation center with hospital-grade equipment and nursing consultants available around the clock.

The reality was that Higgins’ boss Mike threatened that she might lose a desired promotion if she spent too many hours at the lactation center instead of her desk. Eager to succeed though heartbroken Higgins agreed. “No breastfeeding” she said through tears.

But when Higgins had her fourth child in 2015 she chose to use the lactation center to store her breast milk. Goldman didn’t try to stop her but her coworkers made their lack of support clear.

The first time she returned to her desk after using the lactation center Higgins found a carton of milk placed on her computer. The second time there was a stuffed cow. Another time when she went to breastfeed Higgins heard the distinct sound of a “moo” coming from male coworkers.

“Jerry leaned back in his chair his hands cupped on either side of his face as he called out in a deep voice while Vito sat next to him and gestured like he was squeezing breasts” Higgins writes in “Bully Market: My Story of Money and Misogyny at Goldman Sachs” (Simon & Schuster) out Aug. 30.

Higgins was a reluctant Wall Streeter having graduated from Bryn Mawr in 1997 and hoping to become a social worker. But her Italian-American family in New Jersey nixed that explaining they wanted a return on their investment after paying Higgins’ college tuition. “We didn’t take out loans to pay $35000 a year for you to get a $20000 job” Higgins’ mother said.

She knew what she had to do. Higgins survived the grueling Goldman Sachs training program in 1998 passed her licensing exam and became an analyst. She worked tirelessly the first year doing so well Mike called her the “best . . . we have” and doubling the bonus she was promised to a staggering $80000.

Between the money and her family’s insistence she stay on Wall Street her career path was set. But that didn’t mean she understood Goldman or its employees. She was the hardworking daughter of hardworking immigrants who struggled financially so Higgins was amazed by the “pure decadence” of the company’s required social gatherings: Cocaine was snorted in bathroom stalls and top-shelf liquors gulped greedily. Employees snacked on $200 seafood towers of lobster tails and king crabs and wolfed down “filet mignon New York strips and double Porterhouses so big they hung off the sizzling plates.”

8 Higgins was told by her boss that he needed “a commercial killer not a class mom.”

Plus there was sex. One late night in the office her first year Higgins went looking for a report but instead found a young female analyst on her knees fellating a coworker in the printer room. It angered Higgins that she worked so hard to escape her New Jersey past while many Goldman employees treated the job like a birthright. “They were able to literally d–k around while their country club parents held their safety nets” she writes. “Here I was cramming for my pitch and they were having sex.”

At the first Goldman holiday party she attended Higgins saw a drunken division head slouched on a couch straddled by his grinding secretary. On the dance floor her coworker Jerry shimmied with his assistant his wedding ring sparkling as he squeezed her gyrating bottom.

Higgins found Goldman’s culture not just oversexed but misogynistic. Her first year Jerry and Vito loudly put together an Excel spreadsheet rating the “f–kability” of the company’s newest female employees. “Let’s throw some quantitative analysis on this” Jerry said. “Research needs to be done on these ladies. I want tit size ass shape and leg length . . .”

Such behavior was never punished. Nearly 15 years later one of Higgins’ new bosses was equally demeaning when searching for a new assistant.

“Nobody too old too ugly too flabby” he announced to the laughing men on his team. “I want ’em young high and tight!”

While Higgins was appalled by the behaviors she witnessed at Goldman Sachs she also flourished there. Mike made his star employee “Higs” a manager a VP and eventually even a managing director (a position only 8% of Goldman employees reach). At one point her yearly bonus surpassed $1000000.

The first promotion in 2006 seemed to come with a caveat though that Higgins quit having kids. “‘I need total devotion from you’ Mike said. His large brown eyes were on my waist like they were trying to send my womb a message.”

Meanwhile not everyone was supportive of Higgins’ initial promotion. “The only reason you got it is because of your vagina” Vinny snarled.

It was a line Higgins often heard. “Most guys at Goldman assume that women who get promoted either filled a quota or screwed . . . someone.”

Goldman’s female employees shared a different story. One told Higgins she was quitting because all the meaningful work was given to the men in the office while another complained about being told she wasn’t “polished enough” though the office was filled with brutes telling dirty jokes. Most women shared stories of senior men staring at their breasts offering unwanted shoulder massages or suggesting they get a “room” for the night.

It wasn’t even easy being a successful female at Goldman Sachs. When Higgins once took an employee named Eric off an account because he was having an affair with the client he grabbed her by the throat and pressed her into a wall. Her toes were off the ground.

8 Higgins’ job often required nights out with clients.

“If I could I’d rip your f–king face off!” he thundered.

Alerting Mike to the situation Higgins found her boss sympathetic — to a point. Mike said he’d talk to Eric but had no intention of firing him. Eric was a champion golfer and knew all the best courses in the world.

“I can’t afford to lose his golf connections” Mike plainly told Higgins.

After years of professional success at Goldman Sachs Higgins’ career was sidetracked with the arrival of a new boss Justin in the early 2010s. While bad behavior was common in the Goldman offices one night in Chicago at a work event a drunken Justin slurred a racial epithet at a black bar employee. It was too much even for a loyal worker like Higgins. Back in New York she registered what was supposed to be an anonymous complaint with HR but one which was quickly relayed back to Mike — and then Justin.

Never again would Higgins find a sympathetic ear at the office. Even when she told Justin she needed time off after suffering a miscarriage he didn’t care. “You were hardly pregnant and it’s been three days already” he said. “When my wife had a miscarriage she was fine after a few days.”

When she complained that after nearly 20 years at Goldman she’d been given her first poor performance review (and her first reduction in bonus money) in 2015 Justin suggested she take down her kids’ pictures from her desk. “I need a commercial killer Jamie not a class mom” he said.

When she later discovered her review included comments that she was too “motherly” and had incorporated the opinions of Jerry and Vito Higgins realized what was happening.

8 Higgins writes that it wasn’t even easy being a successful female at Goldman Sachs.

“It was official: My career and reputation were being sabotaged.” While she had thrived at one of Wall Street’s biggest firms for almost two decades she’d done it against the odds. Bosses like Justin were frequently bonding with their male peers at strip joints on Vail skiing weekends or in Vegas bacchanals but no women were allowed — not wives and not even female Goldman employees.

“There was an intentionality behind this madness: to keep the strongest relationships with management and the largest clients and therefore the influence with these types of men. It maintained the old boys’ club and solidified its power” Higgins writes.

Seeing the writing on the wall Higgins made a plan to work at Goldman long enough to bank two more bonuses. After doing so in 2016 she quit to get more involved with her children’s lives.

The first morning she didn’t return to Wall Street Higgins stayed home with four violently ill kids. It was gross she thought — but not as gross as Goldman Sachs.

When reached for comment a Goldman Sachs spokesperson said: “We strongly disagree with Ms. Higgins’ characterization of Goldman Sachs’ culture and we decline to respond to anonymized allegations.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vcmVhc29uLmNvbS92b2xva2gvMjAyMi8wOC8yMC9yYW1hc3dhbXktaG8tYW5kLWdvbGRtYW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ramaswamy Ho and Goldman,"In Woke Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam lawyer and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy talks about his internship at Goldman Sachs—an internship that he starts by saying was coveted because Goldman was ""the most elite financial institution in America."" ""You didn't join Goldman as a summer intern for the $1500-per-week paycheck though that wasn't bad. Or for the possibility of a $65000-a-year full-time offer for a 100-plus-hour-a-week job. You did it for the privilege of saying: 'I work at Goldman Sachs.'"" But he soured on Goldman in part because of things like the following incident:

The hallmark event at Goldman Sachs the summer I worked there wasn't a poker tournament on a lavish boat cruise followed by a debauched night of clubbing as it had been at the more edgy firm where I'd worked the prior summer. Rather it was ""service day""—a day that involved dressing up in a T-shirt and shorts and then dedicating time to serving the community. Back in 2006 that involved planting trees in a garden in Harlem. The co-head of the group at the time was supposed to lead the way. I welcomed the prospect of a full day spent at a park away from Goldman's cloistered offices. Yet when I showed up at the park in Harlem very few of my colleagues seemed interested in … well planting trees. The full-time analysts shared office gossip with the summer analysts. The vice presidents one-upped each other with war stories about investment deals. And of course the head of the group was nowhere to be found.

It was supposed to be an all-day activity yet after an hour I noticed that very little service had actually been performed. As if on cue the co-head of the group showed up an hour late—wearing a slim-fit suit and a pair of Gucci boots. The chatter among the rest of the team died down as we awaited what he had to say. ""Alright guys"" he said with a somber expression as though he were going to discipline the team. A moment of tension hung in the air. And then he broke the ice: ""Let's take some pictures and get out of here!"" The entire group burst into laughter. Within minutes we had vacated the premises. No trees had been planted. Within a half hour the entire group was seated comfortably at a nearby bar that was well prepared for our arrival—pitchers of beer ready on the tables and all. I turned to one of the younger associates sitting next to me at the bar. I remarked that if we wanted to have a ""social day"" then we should've just called it that instead of ""service day."" He laughed and demurred: ""Look just do what the boss says."" Then he quipped back: ""You ever heard of the Golden Rule?"" ""Treat others like you want to be treated"" I replied. ""Wrong"" he said. ""He who has the gold makes the rules."" I called it ""the Goldman Rule."" I learned something valuable that summer after all.

And Ramaswamy then returns to use this phrase elsewhere in the book.

Of course ""He who has the gold makes the rules"" is a familiar line often labeled ""the Golden Rule"" as a play on the other quite different Golden Rule. Ramaswamy labeled it ""the Goldman Rule"" likewise as a play on Golden Rule.

Then this past Thursday the Ramaswamy formulation appeared in Judge James Ho's concurrence in denial of en banc in Sambrano v. United Airlines. The specific legal dispute at this stage of the case is as so many legal disputes about procedural questions (such as when preliminary injunctions are available in religious discrimination cases when opinions should be labeled precedential and when courts should rehear cases en banc) but the underlying substantive question relates to United Airlines' vaccination mandate and its absence of religious exemptions. Here's an excerpt from Judge Ho's opinion:

If the dissent is right and this case is indeed pathbreaking it's important to understand why. What's new here is not the law but the behavior of industry. Historically corporations typically focus on increasing shareholder value—not on imposing certain cultural values on others. But that is rapidly changing. I began by imagining a hypothetical employer who doesn't care how productive an employee you might be—he insists that you abandon certain religious beliefs he finds offensive whether it's abortion marriage sexuality gender or something else. But here's the thing: What was once hypothetical is now rapidly becoming reality. Examples of this abound. [Citations omitted. -EV] So this case may be the first but I suspect it will not be the last. [* * *] A prominent commentator and former CEO recently expressed ""deep[ ] concern[ ]"" about this ""new model of capitalism"" calling it ""a dangerous expansion of corporate power that threatens to subvert American democracy."" Vivek Ramaswamy Woke Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam 18 (2021). As he explained ""America was founded on the idea that we make our most important value judgments through our democratic process where each citizen's voice is weighted equally rather than by a small group of elites in private. Debates about our social values belong in the civic sphere not in the corner offices of corporate America."" ""[T]here's a difference between speaking up as a citizen and using your company's market power to foist your views onto society while avoiding the rigors of public debate in our democracy."" ""When companies use their market power to make moral rules they effectively prevent … other citizens from having the same say in our democracy."" In sum ""it's the Goldman Rule in action. The guys with the gold get to make the rules."" Id. at 18. Not surprisingly many Americans bemoan the impact that this new form of capitalism is starting to have on our Nation's culture. Cf. Oliver v. Arnold 19 F.4th 843 843–44 853–54 (5th Cir. 2021) (Ho J. concurring in denial of rehearing en banc); Villarreal v. City of Laredo _ F.4th _ _–_ (5th Cir. 2022) (Ho J. concurring). My point today is less ambitious: We know what this new corporate trend is doing to employees. It's violating the religious convictions of workers across the country. And in cases like this the injuries are irreparable.

So here's the controversy: Some are claiming that referring to this as the ""Goldman Rule"" is ""antisemitic"" (on the theory that ""Doesn't really matter if he meant to be antisemitic. It is and there's a reason this kind of rhetoric is bubbling up now."") See also here and here (""completely internalized antisemitism"") and here.

I take it the theory is that the label ""Goldman Rule"" is an attempt to condemn Goldman as a Jewish-founded company or presumably to tie the universal principle (""The guys with the gold get to make the rules"") specifically to Jews—rather than as the passage from the opinion suggests to condemn certain behavior by large corporations generally (such as the not-particularly-Jewish-linked United Airlines).

This strikes me as quite mistaken. One great consequence of America's longstanding relative openness to Jews has been that many Jews have thrived and reached prominence—in business in politics and elsewhere. When you become prominent enough things become named after you: businesses statutes sayings and more.

Some of them are positive for instance using Einstein as the paragon of genius (though even that might be used sarcastically and negatively). Some of them are neutral or perhaps negative but in a way that doesn't reflect on the author for instance the other Goldman Rule named after screenwriter William Goldman: ""Nobody knows anything"" when it comes to predicting which movies will be successful. Some of them are negative in a way that's critical of their namesakes such as Ramaswamy's Goldman Rule. Some of them are purely descriptive but may be loathed by those who disapprove of their substance. (There's a gun control statute for instance called the Lautenberg Amendment after Senator Frank Lautenberg.)

More broadly some will criticize prominent people and institutions that happen to be Jewish much as they may criticize prominent people and institutions that happen to belong to other groups. That will include people and institutions that are associated with businesses that for various reasons have been disproportionately Jewish (including for instance finance) precisely because lots of Jews have become prominent in those fields and there are thus more Jewish-linked institutions in those fields that merit comment whether negative positive or neutral. Recall Ramaswamy's story: He went to Goldman precisely because it was seen as so ""elite.""

And of course such institutions shouldn't be immune from criticism any more than institutions associated with other groups. It's just as legitimate to criticize Mark Zuckerberg as Jack Dorsey and just as legitimate to criticize Goldman Sachs as any other business (or as some people back in the day criticized the Rockefellers or J.P. Morgan or the like). And unsurprisingly Goldman Sachs is routinely harshly criticized at least as often from the Left (see e.g. this Bernie Sanders anti-Goldman-Sachs ad and many of these articles in The Nation to choose just one Left publication) as from the Right. Ramaswamy's ""Goldman Rule"" is pretty tame compared to some such criticisms. Will some anti-Semite listeners or readers endorse such criticisms because of their own preconceived anti-Semitic notions? Doubtless so. But the stupid reactions of some stupid people don't make it improper for us to engage in legitimate criticism (though of course one can always disagree with that criticism on the merits).

Now to be sure someone who hadn't read Ramaswamy's story might wonder ""Why is Ramaswamy calling it the 'Goldman Rule'?"" But thankfully we live in an era where all human knowledge is on a small box in each of our pockets. A few keystrokes will let you search for ""ramaswamy 'goldman rule'"" and there you have the answer: Ramaswamy thought Goldman was elite decided his idol had feet of clay and then used the coincidental similarity of ""Goldman"" and ""Golden"" as a way of criticizing what he saw as overstepping by business generally (and not by the way just financial businesses which are more associated with Jews than corporate America generally). Judge Ho quoted part of Ramaswamy's criticism in the process quoting Ramaswamy's label.

Seems quite reasonable to me (though again one can argue whether that criticism is indeed apt in this situation). There really is real anti-Semitism out there regrettably. This isn't it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vc2lmdGVkLmV1L2FydGljbGVzL2V2cmVuc2VsLWNhcGl0YWwtcGFydG5lcnMtYXRoZW5hLWFudGhvbnktbW9vcmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LinkedIn influencers a €5bn loan and the goddess of wisdom: the story of the mystery fund that never delivered,"Last August Claire Walsh was looking for support for her startup an ethical investment platform when Louise McCarthy’s profile caught her eye.

When she reached out to ask advice from the 56-year-old businesswoman — who lists Bain HSBC and Aviva on her CV — she got an even better response than she expected. McCarthy was setting up a fund to back female-founded companies and Walsh’s startup looked like a match.

“I sent a pitch deck and within three weeks Louise said they would fully fund us"" Walsh said. ""It felt too good to be true and I'm the first to say if something sounds too good to be true it probably is.”

Nearly a year later that money has still not arrived.

What follows is the mysterious story of how Walsh and more than a dozen other female founders and extremely qualified advisers got caught up in the plans for a new £10m fund that ultimately hasn't delivered any money at all.

The bizarre scheme leads back to an ex-Goldman Sachs septuagenarian living in Istanbul and an investment company with an opaque track record and interests from gold to hospitality. It’s a cautionary tale about due diligence — and a sad reminder that the most vulnerable founders are often the ones left in the lurch.

The birth of Athena

When it comes to diversity tech is in the stone age. In Europe just 1.1% of funding goes to startups led by only women — a percentage that’s actually grown worse in recent years. The VC industry’s systemic bias against women is well-documented.

It’s a number that McCarthy is very passionate about as she told Sifted on the phone in early August. The self-described LinkedIn influencer — she has more than 35k followers — has worked at many international corporates and currently serves as a non-executive director and adviser for several companies.

“As a woman in business and an entrepreneur myself I understand the huge challenges that female entrepreneurs face because I have experienced them throughout my entire career” she told Sifted later in an email.

She met investor Anthony Moore (who has nearly 23k followers himself) through LinkedIn more than a year ago. Turkey-based Moore is a financier whose current company Evrensel Capital Partners (ECP) says it invests in sectors like the environment and hospitality.

He told her he would back her in setting up a VC fund to invest in female founders. No matter that McCarthy didn't have any investment experience “her business experience was vastly more important” Moore told Sifted in one of more than 16 emails sent to our reporters in August. McCarthy who Sifted also spoke to on the phone and over email told Sifted she has 35 years of experience working with female entrepreneurs.

The female founders are found

Quickly women like Walsh were introduced to the nascent fund some through shared work experience with McCarthy and others through mutual connections starting in August 2021. The 11 people that Sifted spoke to for this piece say that founders and advisers were reassured by McCarthy’s LinkedIn connections and the quality of the founders and advisers — with backgrounds in investing startup building and at multinational corporates — who were joining the group.

The majority of the people Sifted spoke to declined to be named for fear of the consequences and over concerns that it might make it hard to raise money.

According to a presentation seen by Sifted the fund planned to invest £10m across more than a dozen companies at seed to Series A stage and would write cheques from £500k to more than £1m. People that Sifted spoke to say that the source of the funds was not made clear. Moore told Sifted that it was supposed to come from a loan to ECP — more on that later.

“I felt that Louise McCarthy in the beginning was very credible. She was a well-known real person and she had also worked previously with two of the people involved who I felt were credible people. I thought that she had no reason to put forward something that isn’t real” said one founder who was offered funding that she ultimately declined.

Before details were given about funding the participants were added to a WhatsApp group. McCarthy encouraged everyone to help come up with a name and a logo for the fund. They settled on Athena Ventures — after the goddess of wisdom.

Weekly check-ins began. So did talks by industry experts in risk management insurance and executive coaching according to people Sifted spoke to all of which ran throughout late 2021 and early 2022. No one had an Athena email address including women that McCarthy had slated to take investment committee positions. McCarthy hadn’t even signed a contract with Moore’s asset management company she said. And barely any due diligence had been done on the startups themselves.

“If you had a positive conversation with [McCarthy] she would immediately put you in a WhatsApp group and she’d put you in the pitch deck. She’d make it real” said the founder who ultimately declined Athena funding.

But the somewhat ragtag setup didn’t matter because things were happening.

“Louise had this fancy-looking PowerPoint deck [about Athena]. If it all came to fruition it sounded fantastic” said Walsh. She said that at the beginning of September 2021 she was told that she would get the money and then signed terms that included clauses limiting her ability to raise from other investors for some time.

Term sheets — the document signed by an investor and founders setting out the terms of the investment — can include temporary exclusivity clauses. The people Sifted spoke to said that term sheets issued by Athena restricted their ability to speak to other investors about investment for as long as three months.

McCarthy insists that the documents were memorandi of understanding and thus not legally binding. (Term sheets are indeed not binding.) Moore told Sifted that he was not aware of exclusivity clauses. “Anyone can raise money from whomsoever they wish. That said we will not invest alongside VCs.” In a call with Sifted Moore said that he felt VCs brought little value to companies.

Athena promised the founders more than just money according to the people who spoke to Sifted and a presentation seen by Sifted. It implied that Athena would provide the portfolio an additional £5m to be spent on support services in areas such as legal and accounting — some provided by Athena and some by friendly suppliers.

“Shared services were on the agenda but nothing was agreed as Athena did not receive funding” Moore told Sifted.

While some other early-stage VCs and accelerators also refer portfolio companies to friendly suppliers it can be difficult for startups to verify whether or not the cost of the services quoted is in line with the market or is high quality investors say.

Concerns and uncertainty about the money

Some participants in the Athena group became uneasy about the funding once they started looking for more information about Moore's company ECP. Several even started to drop out as early as September and October 2021.

McCarthy said that Moore kept reassuring her that the money was coming but used excuses like delays with the source of the funding including Know Your Customer checks. Moore told Sifted that the failure to deliver funding was “100% due to a lender breaching a legally binding agreement”.

One piece of information that concerned some Athena participants was the fact that ECP had promised to invest £250k in a UK medical device company TruSpine Technologies which said in April 2021 that the capital never came through.

Sifted reached out to TruSpine for comment but the firm declined to add anything more than is publicly known. Moore said that the reports about TruSpine were “correct” and that the funds never came through “for various reasons of which the company is well aware”.

Meeting Moore

Other things made the Athena participants wary such as legal documents and a hectic first meeting via video call with Moore in Istanbul in autumn 2021. Four people who were present said that the investor dialled in from a noisy outdoor location in Turkey. He could barely hear the participants and they could barely hear him.

Moore said he was not aware of the circumstances of the meeting and that he “would have apologised for the noise"".

“I had several calls with Athena people. They were most enjoyable and feedback was very good.”

Walsh said: “When you did question things we were told we were a small part of something bigger. We were told they were looking at much bigger deals of hundreds of millions.

“I had concerns all the way along but it was hard to see why they would lead us on and Louise was adamant Athena would get things sorted by Christmas. My cofounder and I scheduled Christmas dinner together to celebrate getting the money.”

But by the end of 2021 the money had still not come.

“We didn’t draw the line. It was a sunk cost fallacy. Because I was six months pregnant and thinking 'What other options do I have to raise?' And they were still saying that the money would come through…”

“Like a fancy bottle of wine”

76-year-old Moore is a larger-than-life character who's been described by Indian media as a “king in the financial market” who is “like a fancy bottle of wine that is only more treasured with time”. Moore also sent Sifted reporters a photo of a limited-edition coffee table book about him from his Huawei phone. He said hard copies are being dispatched but aren’t for sale.

Those familiar with Moore say he talks frequently about his Goldman career where he was a VP from 1983 to 1991 though he never rose to the “executive suite” at the firm. Goldman confirmed the years of his employment.

Moore’s company ECP was registered in Jersey in 2019 and invests in dozens of disparate areas and across continents according to its website and to Moore himself.

“ECP is not a fund and therefore has no AUM [assets under management]. We are a global corporate advisory investment and trading company. We seek to raise loan capital into ECP which we then invest — equity or debt — at our discretion. Startups are a limited area of interest for us and media even less so. Renewable energy waste management hotels and hospitality and mining are far higher on our list of priorities” Moore said in an email.

ECP’s website says there are 21 companies in the ECP group. Athena is one of them. The others span everything from ECP Hydrogen dedicated to hydrogen research; ECP LatAm which owns and manages South American rainforests; ECP-CCX a crypto exchange; and ECP Mongolia a gold mining operation.

One person worked as a project manager for ECP after being drawn in by the impressive roster of advisers listed on the website — 29 at last count before they were removed from the website once Sifted started reporting. The person asked to remain anonymous for fear of consequences. Moore put this person in charge of multiple projects and promised them a budget.

Just like in the Athena case none of it materialised. “From my knowledge ECP has not done a single deal” the person said. “They promised me shares in the company I was promised a salary that never came.”

Moore told Sifted that he did promise funding for projects but that it was dependent on a loan to ECP being agreed upon. He said many ECP employees have received shares in the company.

The project manager said he was told that money for the projects was coming from a Saudi investment firm. When the wait went on too long he said he grew suspicious and eventually left the firm. Moore told Sifted that ECP had been in talks to secure funding from Saudi Arabia but that the investor declined to pursue the deal.

When asked about deals that ECP has completed Moore said that there were “too many to list here. We are currently in the middle of three very significant gold trades”. He said that ECP does not pay salaries — to anybody — but that “everyone is there to share in the upside”.

Another person Sifted spoke to said that Moore had asked them to be an adviser and had added them to the website without asking. Moore denied that he had ever added anyone to the ECP website without their permission.

“I’ve never seen proof that Evrensel has a fund. It’s talked about and it’s hyped up and they have many many advisers a very surprising amount of advisers actually but I haven’t seen anything of substance” another person familiar with ECP told Sifted. Moore denied that ECP is a fund.

Advisers listed on the ECP website currently include people with work experience at Macquarie and Huawei.

Sifted did speak to one founder who received funding from ECP. The person said they were pleased with the work ECP had done though added that there were times when funds came through late.

A Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing from more than a decade ago shows Moore was ordered to pay $25k to the US Treasury for violating certain sections of securities law. At that time Moore was running another fund MCC Global NV which was listed in Frankfurt.

“We were reprimanded. Importantly I was not banned from being a director of a public company or indeed a company in the same industry. The fine in SEC terms was very small. For those who understand SEC rulings it indicates that the punishment was minimal. There is no dispute and the matter is now beyond the 10-year statute of limitations. No criminal offence and I have assumed many directorships since that time” Moore responded.

The €5bn that didn’t arrive

Many of Athena’s early participants pulled out in the autumn of 2021 but others held on until spring this year. They said that McCarthy continued to assure them that the funding would come through though deadlines kept changing.

On April 1 McCarthy cancelled the weekly check-ins and told participants they should look for other funding options according to text messages seen by Sifted.

When asked by Sifted why the money didn't come through she said that ECP had “a change in their financial conditions and they lost their funds”.

Later that month McCarthy was featured in a podcast talking about Athena: “It’s not giving them a bit of money it’s giving them all the money they need wrapping our arms around them and providing them with mentorships support coaching and everything they need to make their business a success.” McCarthy declined to answer whether the podcast was recorded before or after she told the Athena founders to seek alternative forms of funding.

Moore said that a lender had promised to provide a 10-year loan of €5bn part of which would have gone to fund the Athena companies. He said that the first funds were due in mid-November but did not arrive.

“Various reasons were given for non-delivery. As the lender expressed feelings of guilt embarrassment and made commitments and promises to make amends I let the matter ride for several months” said Moore in an email adding that ECP is “about to launch a claim of alleged breach of contract”.

Moore declined to confirm the identity of the lender. Moore told Sifted that ""no guarantees were ever given about delivery and that it was always clear that the ability to provide funding was dependent in raising investment capital into ECP"".

Moore said ECP was trying in the meantime to raise $50m in debt. Sifted saw a fact sheet included below advertising the raise to high-net worth individuals corporates family offices and private banks to invest in Series A and Series B startups — slightly later stage than the startups involved in Athena.

The months of delay meant that Athena founders who had chosen to stick it out had lost valuable time they could have spent fundraising elsewhere. Some even hired suppliers and staff based on the assumption that they would receive funding.

The experience of Athena Ventures highlights the vulnerability of early-stage founders who often struggle to find funding. Even more concerning: the Athena Ventures experience doesn't seem to be an isolated one. Sifted spoke to at least seven women who had similar experiences where they were promised money by investors that never arrived.

“If you get the sense that something may not work for you you can’t be afraid to withdraw from it. That’s a tough decision to take. But actually many of us did take that decision” said the founder who chose not to go ahead with Athena funding.

“This is not a story of how all the women got fooled. This is a story of: the homework worked the due diligence worked. Some people stayed in and some people had a very unfortunate outcome.”

As for Claire Walsh she has since moved on from her startup and is busy raising her child. But the question remains over what all those hours of calls with lawyers and camaraderie-building meetings with female founders meant.

“I feel angry and disappointed"" she said. ""They obviously lied to us. I don’t know why or what they were doing.”

McCarthy told Sifted she was disappointed and saddened that ECP had not been able to secure the funding it had been promised. She told Sifted on the phone she would be going to support women in Indonesia later this year.

“I feel totally let down my route now to tackle (the problem) is through charity work.”

Quantum research today means big business. What was once seen as a scientific curiosity quantum computing now promises to transform many aspects of everyday life from cybersecurity to drug development and weather forecasting. In recent years work in quantum computing has begun to move out of universities and into corporate research labs with large multinationals as well as start-ups and venture capitalists entering the race to commercialize quantum technologies. But for all the record funding announcements and hype some warn that this is fostering a “quantum bubble” that may soon pop.

The heart and soul of a quantum computer are quantum bits or qubits. These are different from standard computer bits which can be either 0 or 1. Qubits on the other hand can be both. Using this feature for complex computational problems means it could be possible to calculate solutions much faster than today’s fastest computers by scaling computing to calculate with many qubits resulting in exponential increase in computing power. Qubits can be made from different hardware platforms such as superconducting qubits or trapped ions. Other upcoming methods are photonic quantum processors that use light instead.

Experts say that a real “quantum advantage” can only be expected when quantum computers operate with a million qubits. And with the current record still below 100 qubits there is still some way to go. But what is mostly hindering progress is the decoherence of the qubits themselves. To avoid this they usually have to be operated at near 0 K and shielded from each other and the environment. Scientifically however there is nothing stopping the creation of large-scale quantum computers but there are some tough engineering problems to solve.

Some of those challenges are being met by huge government programmes. In the US the government is putting $1.2bn into its National Quantum Initiative programme that is aimed at both academia and the private sector while the UK government is nearing the end of its 10-year £1bn National Quantum Technology Programme which began in 2013. Meanwhile the Netherlands funnelled €615m last year into the umbrella organization Quantum Delta NL to foster the development of quantum technologies. This all stands in the shadow however of China’s $10bn estimated funding for its national programme.

From big tech to small tech

Quantum computing is currently dominated by tech giants such as IBM Amazon Hewlett Packard Honeywell Google and Microsoft with some of these investing heavily in quantum initiatives. Google has a 53-qubit quantum processor named Sycamore while IBM unveiled its plans to produce a 433-qubit chip later this year and a 1121-qubit chip in 2023. IBM quantum devices have already been made available for use by more than 200000 clients via a cloud-based service.

Indeed many large corporations are exploring quantum applications. Goldman Sachs is developing quantum optimization algorithms to price assets based on the inherent risk associated with for example different options or stocks. It says that financial operations could already benefit from quantum computers in the next five years. Car manufacturer Daimler meanwhile is investigating how quantum computers can simulate new materials for the development of higher-performing and lower-cost car batteries. HSBC bank announced last April a partnership with IBM to study the potential of quantum computing in banking.

And it is not just the big players that are in the game. The number of quantum-based start-ups has been on the rise for several years with 265 according to the latest estimate from Quantum Computing Report. And some are making big steps forward. US-based start-up ColdQuanta launched a 100-qubit processor based on cold atoms this year and hopes to upgrade to 1000 qubits in the next three years. Another US company – IonQ – was the first quantum start-up that began trading publicly on the New York Stock Exchange last year which allowed it to raise well over $600m in investment funding. Another significant deal features PsiQuantum which secured a $450m round this year based on its promise to build a full-scale photonic-based quantum computer by 2025.

Given that there is a solid scientific foundation underpinning the potential of quantum technology the question is not if it will happen but when Freeke Heijman

Quantum-based start-ups are also attracting the interest of venture capitalists. This is slightly counterintuitive as venture capitalists typically bet on “safe horses” which is not the case with commercial products that are expected to hit the market a decade or so from now. Nonetheless according to the consultancy firm McKinsey venture capital and other private capital now make up more than 70% of quantum technology investments. And where only $93.5m was invested in 2015 in 2021 that figure had risen to a staggering $3.2bn.

The danger of all this investment is that it leads to a bubble but that it not worrying some at least for now. “I don’t believe there will be a general crash of investment because in the next few years we will see successes being announced and organizations using quantum computing for real-world commercial or scientific applications” says Doug Finke who runs Quantum Computing Report.

Freeke Heijman director of ecosystem development at Quantum Delta NL adds that a little bit of hype is not necessarily bad as it will help to excite people to go into quantum technologies. “Given that there is a solid scientific foundation underpinning the potential of quantum technology the question is not if it will happen but when” she adds.

Across town at Wolcott Park Les Milch hit the courts donning a shirt that read “Some grandpas take naps real grandpas play pickleball (then take a nap).”

After finishing a game Chuck Pirrello shared that he chose his West Hartford home based on its proximity to the pickleball courts.

For enthusiasts pickleball is more than a pastime — it’s a culture.

As pickleball’s popularity grows West Hartford has emerged as a hub for public play in the capital region. This month the town opened six new pickleball courts doubling its available play space.

On sunny mornings and lamp-lit evenings West Hartford’s pickleball courts draw teenagers to octogenarians. Some live in town others travel from nearby to enjoy camaraderie and competition.

“It’s a really inclusive sport. You find people of all ages and many different ethnic backgrounds” said Peter Qoo. “I don’t have to arrange a date with anyone. I don’t need to book a court. I can just show up and play”

Qoo said that he started playing pickleball last year after his wife’s uncle introduced the couple to the sport.

“He became sort of a zealot and so he proselytized us which I think is kind of common among pickleball players” Qoo said.

For the last two years the Sports and Fitness Industry Association has recognized pickleball as the fastest growing sport in the country. In February the SFIA estimated that the U.S. has more than 4.8 million pickleball players.

West Hartford Pickleball Club President Ben Reder credits pickleball’s surging popularity in Connecticut to the pandemic.

“There was an amazing confluence between the rise of the sport and COVID” Reder said. “I had never played pickleball. I was a squash player as were a lot of the individuals that I started playing pickleball with and all indoor facilities were closed. … So we sort of said ‘Hey let’s try this pickleball thing.'”

When Reder started the West Hartford Pickleball Club two years ago he said that if he could get 25 people to join it would be a success. Today the club has nearly 300 members.

Reder said that the club which charges a $20 annual membership fee focuses on increasing access and equity in the sport. The club actively works with the town to offer clinics and programs for players looking to expand their skill set.

Reder stressed that the club is open to players at every level not just elites. He said that the sport’s accessibility is part of the beauty of the game.

“If someone has never touched a paddle and they have a little bit of athleticism you can spend 30 minutes teaching them the game and they can be playing that same day” Reder said. “I think from that standpoint it has really helped the sort of cult following just because it’s so easy to get into and the barrier to entry is very low.”

According to the USA Pickleball Association the sport was invented in the summer of 1965 by Congressman Joel Pritchard and businessman Bill Bell of Washington State.

Determined to quell their families’ summertime boredom they set out to an old badminton court on the Pritchards’ property. But with no racquet or shuttlecock Pritchard and Bell instead picked up what was on hand — ping pong paddles and a perforated plastic baseball — and the sport was born.

According to the official lore pickleball derives its name from the rowing term “pickle boat” which describes a thrown together crew.

For Cersosimo and Wanda Jones had they not started playing pickleball three years ago they never would have met their new crew — a group of women who call themselves the BABs or Bad-Ass-Babes.

“We have this group of 13 and had it not been for pickleball we would not have been together” Cersosimo said. “We’re from all different backgrounds and different interests. And when the 13 of us are together it’s like we’ve been together forever. We’re like sisters.”

Cersosimo and Jones said that the group has extended its activities to bowling trivia nights and pool parties but they still go out to the courts nearly every day to play with the rest of the West Hartford pickleball community.

“It is a culture. It’s a healthy happy atmosphere of a culture that you should embrace if you want to learn to play” Cersosimo said. “It’s just fun.”

Hasbro recently became quite fond of releasing figures on old Toy Biz-styled cards and now it’s Ghost Rider‘s turn. Though this figure doesn’t glow in the dark like every figure in that line used to. This Ghost Rider figure appears to use body parts from prior figures like the AIM trooper but comes with alternate gloved and skeletal hands flaming Johnny Blaze head and the fiery chain that’s his signature weapon.

This Ghost Rider also comes with flame effects to wrap around his wrists. Given that that’s way more than the usual two accessories he’ll probably come at a premium price. For now though all we know is preorders begin sometime next month.

At Comic-Con Hasbro’s Marvel team strongly hinted that the next HasLab will have ties to Ghost Rider somehow. So getting Johnny Blaze out ahead of the big-ticket item seems smart. Fans currently speculate that the Robbie Reyes Ghost Rider with his flaming car seems the likeliest contender. Other Ghost Riders generally ride cycles that can sell at affordable retail prices.

The round brings Incredible Health’s total funding to date to $97 million and raises its valuation to $1.65 billion.

Founded in 2017 the company “puts nurses in the driver’s seat” Iman Abuzeid Incredible Health’s CEO and co-founder said in an interview. Hospitals apply directly to nurses rather than the other way around.

On the platform hospitals get matched with permanent nurse hires in an average of less than 14 days compared to the industry average of 82 days according to Abuzeid. She said an interview request is sent from a healthcare employer to a nurse every 30 seconds.

Abuzeid also claimed that Incredible Health is the only platform that uses automation to help screen nurses’ credentials and employment preferences. The company’s algorithms recognize more than 70 specialties and 250 skills including specific intensive care unit and operating room skills.

The San Francisco-based startup charges employers for the use of its platform but nurses use it for free. About 10000 nurses join Incredible Health every week Abuzeid declared.

Sponsored Post A Personalized Approach to Medication Nonadherence At the Abarca Forward conference earlier this year George Van Antwerp managing director at Deloitte discussed how social determinants of health and a personalized member experience can improve medication adherence and health outcomes.

She added that 600 hospitals use Incredible Health for staffing including Kaiser Permanente Stanford Health Care HCA Healthcare Providence Johns Hopkins Medicine Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and NYU Langone Health. Each hospital location that uses the platform saves at least $2 million per year in costs for travel nurses overtime and human resources according to Abuzeid.

While Incredible Health indirectly competes with job boards such as Indeed and LinkedIn Abuzeid claims her company is the only healthcare job matching platform that considers nurses’ credentials and preferences before matching them with an employer. She also said that Incredible Health has an advantage over traditional nurse recruitment agencies that do not use automation software for scale and speed.

The company also differentiates itself from other venture-backed healthcare staffing companies such as Nomad Health and IntelyCare because it is focused on filling permanent positions instead of temporary staffing Abuzeid said.

The company’s funding comes at a critical time — more than 10000 registered nurses left the workforce in 2021 the worst exodus the profession had seen in more than four decades. Even though this employee deficit is dire Abuzeid argues “the processes tools and technology for hiring permanent nurses have not changed in 20 years.” That is what Incredible Health aims to change she said.

Incredible Health will use the funds it raised to enhance its screening and matching algorithms and expand its services to reach 90% of the country’s nurse workforce Abuzeid said. The company will also utilize some of the funds to strengthen the professional resources it offers to nurses including educational scholarships skills growth courses and relocation support. Abuzeid added that these features make Incredible Health not just a place for nurses to find jobs but also a place for them to manage their careers.

Going forward Abuzeid said Incredible Health has plans to extend its staffing capabilities beyond nursing to other types of healthcare workers facing critical staffing shortages such as home health aids and laboratory technicians. The company also aims to widen its customer base beyond hospitals to surgical centers and urgent care facilities.

The incident happened after Erin Mims left her birthday celebration at a restaurant this week KPRC-TV reported. When she got to her car she saw the napkin on the door handle.

""I took it out with my nails and threw it and got in the car"" Mims told the outlet. ""I asked [my husband] about it and he said he didn't put a napkin in there.""

Mims went back into the restaurant to wash her hands but started to feel ""tingling"" in her arms and was struggling to breathe KRIV reported.

""I started getting hot flashes my chest was hurting my heart was beating really fast"" she told the outlet.

She was taken to HCA Houston Healthcare and underwent tests. Doctors were unable to determine the substance in her body. However one doctor informed her that it was possibly a failed kidnapping according to the report.

""It's crazy. It just makes me think that we're not safe and that there are some crazy people going out in the world doing things"" she told KRPC-TV.

The Houston Police Department is looking into the matter according to the outlet. HCA Houston Healthcare warns people who are experiencing symptoms after being exposed to a poisonous substance to contact first responders immediately.

But Vietnam War veteran Bill Beck can.

The Hampden Township resident was the inspiration for an action figure designed recently by Cotswold Collectibles of the Dallas Texas area. The organization owned by Greg Brown also coordinated the Hershey Action Figure & Toy Show at the Hershey Lodge and Convention Center on Saturday where the limited-edition action figure was debuted.

The action figure is the latest in an Elite Brigade line of action figures produced by Cotswold Collectibles Brown said. But this is the first one based on a real-life hero.

“It’s been super fun” Brown said. “It’s my favorite project I’ve worked on. I’ve worked on sets for almost 17 years. This was kind of close to the heart.”

Beck accepted the honor quite humbly. He shies away from considering himself a hero. Instead he sees himself as representing his friends and fellow soldiers – especially those who made the ultimate sacrifice.

“That action toy is a symbol” he said “for all my buddies that fought over there. If it wasn’t for my buddies giving their lives for me we wouldn’t have a Bill Beck action figure. If it wasn’t for their sacrifices I’d just be another number at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington D.C.

Beck an Army machine-gunner in the 1st Battalion of the 7th Cavalry Regiment fought in the battle of Ia Drang in November 1965. It was the first major military engagement between U.S. Army troops and the North Vietnamese Army and the U.S. troops greatly outnumbered sustained heavy losses.

Beck said he still lives with the harrowing memories of watching his best friends get killed in front of him. He was awarded the Silver Star and Bronze Star for his bravery during the battle.

The story of the battle was told in a 2002 movie starring Mel Gibson which was based on the book “We Were Soldiers Once…And Young.”

In 2017 Beck also received the Living Legend Award from the Army Heritage Center Foundation.

The action figure set is titled “Battle of Ia Drang (SP4 Bill Beck).” Beck saw it for the first time Saturday and said he was impressed with the authentic detail. The set includes fatigues T-shirt insignia boots helmet with cover web belt harness pistol with holster bayonet with sheath field pack canteen with cover hand grenades ammo pouches ammo box and a M-60 machine gun with ammo belt.

The figure comes in a box adorned with an oil painting of Beck and the 7th Cavalry Regiment created by artist Larry Selman of Waynesboro whom Beck calls “one of the most gifted illustrators of our time.”

A Pennsylvania native Selman has had a highly successful career in illustration working with major publishers receiving prestigious awards and being featured in galleries. Among his claims to fame is illustration work on much of the GI Joe Classic Collection packaging.

Selman was raised in a military family which left a lasting impact on him and his work.

“I painted every period of American military history and every branch of history” he said.

Selman has worked with Medal of Honor recipients and other military veterans as he seeks to depict their role in American history.

During one project he was working on about five years ago Selman connected with several surviving soldiers from Ia Drang including Beck. Selman then connected Beck with Brown. The action figure set and box design have been about five years in the making.

“Bill’s project is kind of a personal thing” Selman said. “I’m always sort of leaning toward Vietnam because that’s the era I grew up in.” He said he reached out to Beck many times during the project to make sure everything was as accurate as possible.

Of all the sets he’s worked on over the years Brown said he plans to keep this one for himself.

While other sets were more general homages to the different branches of military he said “This is somebody that we got to really know.”

The figure comes in a white box that is much like the exclusive line of GI Joe boxes of the 1960s designed by David Howard.

Cotswold Collectibles produced 30 sets for the show and plans to produce 70 more. Options to buy the set should appear on its website GIJoeelite.com early next week.

The toy show has been held in the area since 2018. Brown said this year that vendor spaces had been sold out for a month and there was a substantial waitlist. The show features local vendors as well as vendors from throughout the country. The show focuses on toys and action figures from the 1950s through the 1990s.

“It’s a very diverse selection” Brown said. “Very nostalgic.”

As he looks forward to continuing his work Brown said he and Selman have already been working on another figure set featuring a Vietnam War veteran in Texas.

“We want to honor these guys” he said. “If this one with Bill takes off maybe we’ll do one a year.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYzI3LmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvZnJpZGF5LW5pZ2h0LWZvb3RiYWxsL2hlcnNoZXktdHJvamFucy1uZWVkLXRydXN0LTIwMjItZm5mLXByZXZpZXcv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWJjMjcuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9mcmlkYXktbmlnaHQtZm9vdGJhbGwvaGVyc2hleS10cm9qYW5zLW5lZWQtdHJ1c3QtMjAyMi1mbmYtcHJldmlldy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hershey Trojans need trust 2022 FNF Preview,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.abc27.com/sports/friday-night-football/hershey-trojans-need-trust-2022-fnf-preview/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYzI3LmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvZnJpZGF5LW5pZ2h0LWZvb3RiYWxsL2hlcnNoZXktdHJvamFucy1uZWVkLXRydXN0LTIwMjItZm5mLXByZXZpZXcv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWJjMjcuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9mcmlkYXktbmlnaHQtZm9vdGJhbGwvaGVyc2hleS10cm9qYW5zLW5lZWQtdHJ1c3QtMjAyMi1mbmYtcHJldmlldy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBlbm5saXZlLmNvbS9nYWxsZXJpZXMvQldXSkxTR1FERkJaTlA0UlpKWERQSDdKS0kv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Veteran Bill Beck and the Hershey Toy Show - pennlive.com,"6 / 7

The chain has around 7000 properties across six continents and all of them — even the most luxurious Conrad and Waldorf Astoria properties — can be booked with points.

You're not just restricted to hotel stays. There are other ways to redeem Hilton Honors points that can provide value. So I'll review your options for redeeming Hilton Honors points in this guide.

Redeem Hilton points for hotel stays

Hilton Honors is a hotel loyalty program so naturally you can redeem your points for hotel stays in the Hilton portfolio. Unfortunately the program doesn't provide a published award chart so your only way to know the award price is to search for your dates.

A good starting point though is the program's Points Explorer tool. This tool highlights the maximum award rate of a property as well as the lowest price recently booked by other members. However these ""discounted"" prices tend to come up when cash prices are lower.

TPG pegs Hilton Honors points at 0.6 cents per point. However given the form of variable pricing the program uses this valuation will vary from hotel to hotel.

For example I found a night at the Conrad Washington D.C. that is bookable for $309 with the Hilton Honors semi-flex discount rate or for 80000 Hilton points. You'll get a redemption value of just 0.38 cents per point if you redeem points.

On the other hand some hotels will give you more than 0.6 cents in redemption value. This usually happens when you get to a property's maximum standard award rate (which is now as high as 120000 Hilton points per night). An example on New Year's Eve the Hampton Inn Grand Central in New York City costs $969.69 per night using the Honors discount rate.

Alternatively you can book the same king room for 70000 points per night giving you a valuation of 1.39 cents per point.

To book an award room start at hilton.com and click ""Sign in"" at the top right. Enter your credentials then click ""Sign in.""

After typing in your city and dates select ""Special rates"" and ensure that you tick the ""Use points"" option. You could also start your search directly from the Hilton Honors homepage and log in later. Again check the ""Use points"" box to see award rates in the search results.

(Screenshot from hilton.com)

Select the property you'd like to book from the results page and follow the on-screen prompts to complete the reservation. Just be sure to pay close attention to the individual hotel's cancellation policy. Most award stays are free to cancel until a couple of days before arrival but some properties have stricter policies.

There are a few other options that you can utilize when redeeming Hilton Honors points for a stay. As you go through the booking process keep your eyes out for the following booking options.

Customize your award with the points and money slider

In addition to booking stays completely with points the Hilton Honors program allows you to use a combination of points and money.

Unlike many other programs that use a fixed number of points and cash for this award option Hilton lets you customize the amount using a slider on the final page before confirming your reservation. You'll still select the full award price from the search results but then you can drag the slider to whatever points and money combination you want:

(Screenshot from hilton.com)

Note that there is a 5000-point minimum for points and money redemptions. The combination of points and money you select is final once you book. However you will earn Hilton Honors points on the cash portion of these stays. So if you're short on points or don't want to burn all your points on one stay this can be a nice option.

Redeem points for premium room awards

One of the best things about Hilton Honors redemptions is that you're not restricted to one room type. You can redeem points for premium rooms including those with better views club lounge access or suites.

The booking process is the same. Once you've selected your desired hotel you can choose between a standard room reward and premium room rewards like this example at the Conrad London St. James.

(Screenshot from hilton.com)

As you can see premium rooms will cost more points than standard rooms. In some cases (like the above) it's likely not worth it.

However if you're looking for extra space for your family it's great to have the option to burn additional points for a suite or larger room instead of hoping your Hilton elite status will score you an upgrade at check-in.

Fifth night free for Hilton Honors elite members

Anyone with Hilton Honors Silver status or higher gets every fifth night free when booking a standard room reward stay. This perk extends to stays of up to 20 nights — during which you'd enjoy four free nights. If you don't have Hilton Honors status consider applying for one of Hilton's American Express cards for automatic status.

Redeem Hilton points for event credits

You can also use Hilton Honors points for a discount on your next Hilton event (but please don't). This can be a wedding corporate event or other types of meetings. When redeeming Hilton points for these discounts you can choose from different denominations of vouchers. Here's how much they cost:

25000 points = $50.

50000 points = $100.

75000 points = $150.

125000 points = $250.

250000 points = $500.

These vouchers provide just 0.2 cents per Hilton point. This is well below TPG's valuation of Hilton points (0.6 cents per point) and isn't a redemption we recommend.

How to redeem Hilton points for experiences

You can also redeem Hilton Honors points for travel experiences through Hilton Experiences.

Available experiences often include tickets to sporting events dinner at top restaurants concert tickets and more. Some of these can be purchased immediately with points while others require you to bid against other Hilton Honors members.

There are some pretty neat experiences available as of writing this piece including the ultimate Sunday brunch at Conrad Centennial Singapore and a Gintastic tasting with a Czech gin aficionado in Prague.

While you're generally best off redeeming hotel points for hotel stays snagging a unique experience using your points can make for a fantastic redemption. This is how TPG's Katie Genter recently enjoyed a 60-minute couples massage and a 4-course dinner for two with just 20000 Hilton Honors points.

Look through the Hilton Honors Experiences page to see if anything strikes your fancy.

How to transfer Hilton points to airlines

Hilton Honors has 27 loyalty partners to which you can transfer your Hilton Honors points.

(Screenshot from hilton.com)

However note that Hilton Honors has less-than-ideal transfer ratios. For example you can exchange 10000 Hilton Honors points for a mere 1000 Delta SkyMiles. Transfer ratios vary from one airline to the next so check Hilton's transfer site for your airline of choice.

Redeem Hilton points on Lyft rides

Hilton has a partnership with Lyft which is a fantastic way to earn some extra Hilton points on your Lyft rides. On the redemption side however it's not so pretty.

(Screenshot from lyft-loyaltywallet.points.com)

You can convert your Hilton points to a Lyft credit — similar to a gift card. Regardless of how much you convert to a Lyft credit you'll get a piddly 0.22 cents per dollar.

Redeem Hilton points for car rentals

Hilton has a partnership with National Alamo and Enterprise so you can redeem your points for a car rental. However this option doesn't provide a good return on your hard-earned points. In our tests using points for a rental car consistently provided 0.2 cents per point.

For example a four-day intermediate car rental with National at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) costs nearly 250000 points.

(Screenshot from hilton.loyaltytravelrewards.com)

You can reserve the same car for around $90 per day (and significantly less with a university code).

Redeem Hilton points for Amazon purchases

Finally you can redeem Hilton Honors points to cover Amazon purchases. Just link your Hilton Honors account to your Amazon account and select Hilton Honors points as your payment method at checkout. Amazon will tell you how many points it takes to cover your order and you can use your points to cover the entire order or just part of your purchase.

Should you use Hilton Honors points for Amazon purchases? Our research found that Hilton Honors points are worth 0.2 cents per point when redeemed toward Amazon purchases. This means you're effectively cutting the currency's valuation by two-thirds.

I'm all for having additional options for using your points and miles but in general you should never use Hilton points (nor any other currency) at Amazon.

How to earn Hilton points

Of course all of the above redemptions require you to have Hilton points in your account. Fortunately there are various ways to earn more Hilton Honors points. One of the quickest ways to do so is by adding a new Hilton Honors card to your wallet. Here are the currently available options and their welcome offers:

The information for the Hilton Aspire card has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.

Bottom line

As you can see there are many interesting ways to redeem Hilton Honors points. However we recommend sticking with hotel stays — this generally provides the most value getting you closer to (or even higher than) TPG's valuation of 0.6 cents per Hilton point.

The other option I'd recommend considering is Hilton Honors Experiences especially if you're looking for a unique event that may not be otherwise available to you.

(Holger M. Obenaus)

The Heritage Golf Group which owns and operates Hilton Head Island-based Oyster Reef Port Royal and Shipyard Golf Clubs recently acquired Palmetto Golf and Country Club expanding its island folio to 117 total holes of golf. Opened in the early 90s the 36-hole venue features layouts designed by Arthur Hills and Robert Cupp. The Arthur Hills Course was the first to welcome golfers in 1991 and was named one of Golf Digest’s “Best New Courses.” The Robert Cupp Course followed in 1993 with a slope rating of 152 – the highest in the state at the time – and a series of geometrically shaped bunkers Cupp designed via CAD (computer-aided design).

“With the resurgence in golf travel and the number of choices golfers have for golf getaways it’s crucial that we promote our region’s amazing golf lodging and culinary assets” says Mark Burnett President and CEO of Heritage Golf Group. “We are thrilled with the recent addition of Palmetto Hall Golf and Country Club to our portfolio and excited for its inclusion in Hilton Head Golf Island alongside Oyster Reef Port Royal and Shipyard.”

As part of the acquisition Heritage Golf Group has committed to a multi-million-dollar golf course improvement project scheduled to begin in the coming weeks. The Arthur Hills and Robert Cupp courses were long considered among the Lowcountry’s best layouts and Heritage Golf Group’s clear-cut objective is to return them to their 90s glory. As a pairing the courses present a compelling contrast – the traditional look and feel of the Arthur Hills Course juxtaposed against the ultra-modern shaping and geometric bunkers of the Robert Cupp Course. Both have been continually praised for their ingenuity shot values playability and conditioning.

(Holger M. Obenaus)

“It’s an exciting day when we can welcome one of the area’s iconic golf brands back to Hilton Head Golf Island” says Lowcountry Golf Course Owner’s Association President Brad Mara. “The addition of Palmetto Hall Golf and Country Club increases our marketing collective to 28 courses including world-renown properties such as The Sea Pines Resort and Palmetto Dunes Oceanfront Resort. With our wide-array of accommodation types and world-class restaurants there’s never been a better time to visit Golf Island.”

Getting to Golf Island has never been easier. Hilton Head Island Airport (HHH) on the island’s north end offers non-stop and one-stop service from multiple hub cities and connections via American Airlines Delta and United. American offers daily non-stop flights from Charlotte and seasonal service from Dallas / Ft. Worth Philadelphia and Washington National (DCA). Delta has daily flights to Atlanta and United provides daily non-stop service to Newark (EWR) and Washington Dulles (IAD).

Golfers can also utilize Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport (SAV) with direct flights from numerous East Coast Midwest and Texas airports on several major and discount airlines. For golfers who prefer to hit the open road major metro areas in the Carolinas Georgia and north Florida are under a half-day’s drive while several Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern cities are seven to nine hours away.

GREENSBORO

Hokkaido Ramen & Sushi

This spot is one of a handful of new sushi offerings on this list and honestly we’re not complaining. Located off of Wendover Avenue at 6010 Landmark Center Blvd. (think near Red Lobster and Home Depot) Hokkaido celebrated their soft opening on Aug. 8. their menu includes curry dishes fried rice and noodles and of course a myriad of sushi. The spot also adds to the area’s growing ramen scene with everything from classic tonkotsu to spicy to a dry veggie ramen. Learn more at hokkaidoramensushi.com.

Shish House Greensboro

Adding to West Market Streets vibrant international cuisine is Shish House Greensboro a new Middle Eastern restaurant. Admittedly we’re a little late on the notice for this one as it’s been open since early July but the menu offers comforting classics like shawarma hummus and falafel in addition to larger entrees of chicken kafta and more. 4929 W. Market St. No website but you can visit their Facebook here.

Reckless Rolls

We’ve actually been keeping an eye on this business since it started circulating on social media earlier this summer. Unlike most of the other businesses on the list Reckless Rolls doesn’t have its own brick and mortar but operates out of City Kitch a commercial kitchen and virtual food hall at 601 Milner Drive near Guilford College. They offer made-to-order poke bowls sushi rolls as well as sushi burritos. To place an order visit their website here.

Qinji Hawaiian BBQ & Ramen

More ramen is never a bad thing. At this spot which was formerly ZC Hawaiian the new owners have combined the previous business’ penchant for Hawaiian food while also adding new items to the menu. Located at 2224 Golden Gate Drive in the same shopping center as Food Lion Qinji offers the familiar Hawaiian plates and also has ramen Spam musubi and even a Japanese cold noodle dish called hiyashichuka which translates to “cold Chinese cuisine.” Learn more at their website here.

Gate City Provisions

Everyone knows a zombie spot when they see one. We’re talking about the locations that have a high turnover rate where no matter what goes in it seems to only last a few years if that. 1901 Spring Garden Street was a building just like that but with Gate City Provisions the location may have met their match for a while. At the helm of the new “not ordinary” deli are the former owners of the beloved Smith Street Diner which closed in 2020 after 15 years. Now at the new location which has gone through several iterations from being a sushi burrito spot to a taco place the owners are offering deli sandwiches soups salads and more.

""She has seen a lot of stuff"" said son Duane Reed whose mother died Aug. 8 after a monthslong illness.

As a child in Shuqualak Miss. she endured segregation and the Great Depression. She was allowed to attend school just three months a year.

Her mother died when she was 5 and she and six siblings scattered to relatives until the Great Migration and President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal carried her coal-miner father north to a steady job in Chicago. Reed who'd been whisked away to care for her sister's kids in Tennessee was about 12 when the family reunited.

Uneasy at her fast-paced integrated Chicago city school Reed quit after the ninth grade. She worked at Canfield Beverages and later at a plant making ammunition for soldiers during World War II.

Being a ""Rosie the Riveter"" proved hard but Reed liked working and abided the Depression era tenets of her family: Work. Waste not. And ""pool your resources!""

She met Walter Reed at a church social. They married in 1945 and moved to St. Paul which remained her adopted home until she died.

""Everybody loved her. She talked to anybody and everybody and treated everybody the same no matter what you looked like or who you were"" said eldest granddaughter Lisa Reaves.

Lillian and Walter moved in with his brother on Iglehart Avenue when they were new to St. Paul. She found assembly line work at the Twin Cities Army Ammunition Plant in New Brighton and later at Honeywell while Walter worked as an orderly at the veterans hospital.

They had three sons before buying a home in 1950 on Carroll Avenue in the historically Black Rondo neighborhood. They lived two blocks from Pilgrim Baptist Church where she brought the boys every Sunday and attended herself for 75 years

On Carroll Avenue Reed taught her small sons the tricks of joyful frugality. Walter Michael Duane and Ronald remember with a chuckle that she'd buy them a single ice cream cone and have them take turns licking.

But like ice cream the treats on Carroll Avenue wouldn't last. The city took the Reed house along with 700 other Rondo houses under eminent domain in 1956 to make way for Interstate 94. The Reeds then built a house on Fuller Avenue for $15000. To pay for it she assembled Honeywell thermostats by day and waitressed nights at Road Buddy's Bar-B-Que.

Reed always said she was comfortable not being rich. She religiously balanced the family checkbook to the penny grew and canned all her vegetables and pooled resources to stave off ""Old Man Poverty"" and survive. Beyond that what mattered most she often said was: ""When you treat people right you can sleep at night"" Duane recalled. ""That's what she really believed contributed to her longevity.""

Reed retired from Honeywell in 1974 after 25 years but didn't rest. She adopted her disabled infant grandson Kevin and went back to school to learn ""the new math"" so she could tutor him and be his advocate at school.

Reed instilled in Kevin and the rest of the family a love for the education she never received.

If given the opportunity she would have been a teacher said Reaves who teaches English in the state of Virginia. ""She loved teaching and history and that combination made her love everything about my profession.""

At 85 Reed flew to Virginia to talk to Reaves' seventh-graders about the influences the Depression segregation the Great Migration and Roosevelt's New Deal had on her life.

Reed's talk became an annual history lesson for Reaves' classes for 15 years. ""These 12- and 13-year-old students loved her stories and her struggle. They write her letters that are so heartfelt"" Reaves said. ""Now I don't have that lesson anymore. But I will try and honor her in another way.""

Funeral services have been held. Reed is survived by sons Walter Michael Duane and Ronald six grandchildren eight great-grandchildren and three great-great-grandchildren.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9uZXdzLmNvbS9tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nL2RlbnNvLWNyZWF0ZXMtZWxlY3RyaWMtbW90b3ItbGlsaXVtLWpldNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Denso creates electric motor for Lilium Jet,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9uZXdzLmNvbS9tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nL2RlbnNvLWNyZWF0ZXMtZWxlY3RyaWMtbW90b3ItbGlsaXVtLWpldNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159BA2A7370>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9uZXdzLmNvbS9tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nL2RlbnNvLWNyZWF0ZXMtZWxlY3RyaWMtbW90b3ItbGlsaXVtLWpldNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL2RldGFpbC8wMDAwNDM0MDkzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary for Kristy Gayle (Williamson) Kirch,"Kristy Gayle (Williamson) Kirch

State regulators ordered a northeast Iowa grain dealer to stop buying large amounts of grain after it failed to pay for an unspecified amount of grain among other violations of its licenses.

The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship announced Friday it suspended the grain dealer and warehouse licenses of B&B Farm Store in Jesup just east of Waterloo.

""The suspension is based upon the company's failure to pay for priced grain grain shortage and record keeping violations"" IDALS said.

Don McDowell a spokesman for the department declined to elaborate on those allegations because IDALS has requested an administrative law hearing about the matter. Such hearings can result in financial penalties for grain dealers.

Generally dealers that buy at least 1000 bushels of grain per month are licensed and regulated by the state to help protect grain producers from losses. Dealers are required to have sufficient assets to cover their debts for grain purchases and those that don't can have their licenses suspended.

District court records show that Farmers State Bank filed last week for foreclosure against B&B and an associated company J&D Investors seeking more than $4.6 million in unpaid debts. The businesses avoided foreclosure early this year through mediation but have since failed to make payments that were stipulated by that mediated agreement according to the bank's recent foreclosure petition. Court records did not indicate any other pending litigation against B&B.

The state maintains an indemnity fund that covers up to $300000 worth of losses incurred by individual producers who sell grain to state-licensed dealers but aren't paid.

B&B Farm Store declined to comment for this article. It's unclear when the administrative law hearing will be held.

The business sells outdoor equipment and supplies and it also operates a feed mill according to air quality permit data of the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. The company's website says it sells feed for cattle dogs goats horses pigs and poultry. Satellite images of the site depict several large grain bins.

That’s clear today as they’ve unveiled the most powerful car in their history.



Known as the Bentley Mulliner Batur the model is a luxurious grand touring coupe that features an upgraded version of the company’s familiar twin-turbo 6.0-liter W12. While the engine is “entering its twilight years” it’s not dead yet and engineers equipped it with a new intake upgraded turbochargers beefy intercoolers and numerous recalibrations. They didn’t stop there as the engine was also outfitted with a titanium exhaust which comes complete with 3D-printed titanium finishers.

Thanks to all these changes the engine produces more than 730 hp (544 kW / 740 PS) and 737 lb-ft (1000 Nm) of torque. That’s at least 80 hp (60 kW / 81 PS) and 74 lb-ft (100 Nm) more than the Continental GT Speed which can rocket from 0-60 mph (0-96 km/h) in 3.5 seconds before hitting a top speed of 208 mph (335 km/h).

While Bentley declined to release detailed performance specifications for the Batur the engine is connected to an eight-speed dual-clutch transmission. The model also comes equipped with four-wheel steering torque vectoring and an electronic limited slip differential.

Other performance features include an adaptive air suspension and an electric active anti-roll control system which can provide up to 959 lb-ft (1300 Nm) of anti-roll torque in a mere 0.3 seconds. The model also sports a Carbon-Silicon-Carbide (CSiC) braking system that features ten-piston calipers and 17.3 inch (440 mm) discs up front as well as four-piston calipers and 16.1 inch (410 mm) discs out back.

The Future Of Bentley Design

Besides being the most powerful Bentley in history the Batur is notable for featuring a modernized design that will “ultimately guide” the styling direction of the company’s upcoming EVs.

The automaker didn’t go into many specifics but noted the car has been equipped with an updated grille that is lower and more upright for a strong and confident appearance. The model also has an “endless bonnet” as well as minimalist headlights that are described as an evolution of those used on the Bacalar.

Moving further back we can see edgy bodywork and a pronounced shoulder line. Designers also moved the car’s visual mass rearward for a sportier and more muscular aesthetic.

Other notable highlights include a power deployable spoiler and 22-inch wheels that are unique to the model. Buyers will also find a front splitter aerodynamic side skirts and a rear diffuser that can be crafted in either carbon or natural fiber composite.

Production will be limited to 18 units and all of them have already been spoken for despite a base price of £1.65 ($1.95 / €1.94) million. Each will be “designed collaboratively” with its owner and they’ll be able to specify the color and finish of virtually every surface of the Batur. For the exterior alone there’s the traditional Mulliner color palette as well as fully bespoke options and even hand-painted graphics. Buyers can also choose between light dark satin gloss or titanium exterior brightwork. Another option is a graduated contrast color grille for a “vibrant ombre effect.”

The interior is extensively customizable as well as clients can order everything from natural fiber composite veneers to more traditional wood trim. If that isn’t special enough certain controls are available in 3D-printed 18K gold.

Once customers create their ideal vehicle it will be handcrafted over the course of several months by Mulliner. If everything goes according to plan the first deliveries should occur in mid-2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG93ZWVrLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Z1dHVyZS1jYXJzL2E0MDk0Njk1OS9jemluZ2Vycy1mb3VyLXNlYXQtaHlwZXItZ3QtY291bGQtYmUtZnV0dXJlLW9mLWNvdXBlLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Czinger's Four-Seat Hyper GT Signals the Future,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.autoweek.com/news/future-cars/a40946959/czingers-four-seat-hyper-gt-could-be-future-of-coupe-production/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG93ZWVrLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Z1dHVyZS1jYXJzL2E0MDk0Njk1OS9jemluZ2Vycy1mb3VyLXNlYXQtaHlwZXItZ3QtY291bGQtYmUtZnV0dXJlLW9mLWNvdXBlLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vaG90aGFyZHdhcmUuY29tL25ld3MvbGFtYm9yZ2hpbmktdXJ1cy1wZXJmb3JtYW50ZS1icmVha3MtY292ZXItYXMtYS02NTctaHAtc3V20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bravo!

Mandatory Credit: Jeff Hanisch-USA TODAY Sports

It appears the Minnesota Golden Gophers are having trouble selling tickets to their first two home games of the season so they’re turning to a rather embarrassing promotion in order to fill the stands.

The Gophers open the 2022 college football season with two home games against the New Mexico State Lobos and the Western Illinois Leathernecks. Tickets to those games aren’t very expensive even if bought at face value – a fan can get into either game for $30 or less – but a new promotion is basically giving the tickets away.

Minnesota is partnering with Red Barron Pizza for an extremely generous promotion. If a fan buys three Red Barron pizzas they can receive two Minnesota football tickets to either the New Mexico State game or the Western Illinois game.

To take advantage of the promotion all fans have to do is purchase any three Red Baron Pizza products at participating stores from Aug. 7 to Aug. 28 then email their receipt to contests@gophersportsproperties.com with a message including your name email address and phone number.

Minnesota’s Huntington Bank Stadium has a listed capacity of 50805. So it looks like Red Barron will have to sell quite a few pizzas if they’re going to fill every seat for their first two home games.

Instead of parroting the rest of the observability industry talking about metrics traces and logs we focused on the value the IBM Instana™ platform brings to users when they use that data.

We never talked about how the IBM Instana platform has metrics traces and logs because that’s kind of a given. Some took—or mistook—that approach to mean that the IBM Instana solution didn’t actually provide any log data one of the three legs of the observability stool. In reality The IBM Instana platform has always captured stored and analyzed application log data. Naturally it’s done within the context of the monitored service the underlying infrastructure all service dependencies overall performance individual traces and the architecture and performance of the application itself.

To actually see that data yourself all you have to do is pop in a trace—and there it is right on the screen—logs. We had our reasons for putting it here mostly because the primary use case of examining log data for our users is troubleshooting which is usually done from within either a trace or from our Unbounded analytics advanced analytics engine.

The value of enterprise observability

Enterprise observability means moving beyond code; ingesting monitoring metrics open-source data (if available) traces log data and even profiles with an understanding of how all these things work together to make better decisions about operating production applications:

Full automation in the monitoring lifecycle

Comprehensive context applied to the entire data set

Intelligent actions taken by both our solution and its users

While traditional application performance monitoring (APM) solutions create visibility where there’s none within the application code itself enterprise observability creates visibility throughout distributed application services whether or not they contain custom code—then correlating metrics logs traces and profiles with an eye on dependencies to get the context of performance in relation to other components. This process helps both the platform and its users take more intelligent action to act proactively and solve problems before they occur.

Where does log data come into enterprise observability?

The IBM Instana platform has been collecting logging data since its early releases. A quick look through our documentation webinar schedule or partner site and you see a set of analysis partners including Humio LogDNA and Coralogix. Most recently IBM exposed logs as a part of the Unbounded analytics section of the IBM Instana to give users data where they need it along with the context to correlate logs to metrics and traces together to make actionable insights faster and more efficiently.

As a bit of background a log is a programmatically produced file that contains a record of events that happen within a system. The point of a log file is to allow a user to keep track of what an application or service is doing inside the computer. Because logs might contain deep data they can be used to debug an application or service when something goes awry. In the most simplistic form log messages are recorded into a single log file though they can also be recorded into any number of files.

In previous releases of the IBM Instana platform contextual log data was available in the context of a trace inside Unbounded analytics which enabled users to quickly and efficiently debug and perform root cause analysis without getting lost in endless screens of log data. Part of the promise of enterprise observability is context and the ability to connect data with other data. While interesting one could argue that data without context is almost irrelevant. To that end and to bring better context to our users we decided to expose the same logging data we already collected on a completely separate and more easily accessible section of Unbounded analytics to make log information easier to absorb and correlate with the other data the IBM Instana platform collects.

Making application logs a first-class citizen of IBM Instana Unbounded analytics

Today marks the availability of logging data through a completely separate section of Unbounded analytics in the IBM Instana platform. It marks the first time IBM Instana users will be able to analyze error and warning logs outside of a trace. Another benefit of being inside Unbounded analytics is the analysis of the log data through our structured query mechanism. By utilizing a structured query mechanism that lets developers and users analyze error and warning logs the IBM Instana solution makes user experience easier by enabling faster and more precise troubleshooting. It will also bring a new perspective to troubleshooting helping identify solve and remove problems.

With this goal in mind IBM still teams with popular log aggregation tools to both integrate with a user’s existing IT operations ecosystem and provide a more traditional system information and event management experience if a user is looking for even more information. We believe that exposing logging data in the Unbounded analytics section of the platform continues our theme of context and intelligent action keeping our users from getting drowned in a sea of logging data and continuing our promise of delivering a fully automated enterprise observability solution.

The business market for virtual assistants will grow 15 percent to more than $7 billion this year according to a Gartner prediction. That growth is coming from companies looking to automate customer interactions sure but also increasingly in areas like advanced search and document insights so that a user could say “pull up last year’s August sales” and an assistant could surface the relevant document.

In the long run we believe that all enterprises across industries are poised to benefit from conversational AI solutions. This will only continue to grow as advancements in AI enable these systems to understand the unique language of their industry and business automate tasks and extract even more precise insights from complex documents and data – without requiring sophisticated data science skills on the part of users. Additionally advancements that enable companies to build deeper integrations and to break down internal data silos will result in better more personalized experiences.

When it comes to customer care the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated adoption of conversational AI solutions across industries with many early adopters in retail healthcare and financial services. For example to help their customers navigate the Covid-19 vaccine rollout process CVS Health engaged IBM Consulting and began using IBM Watson Assistant to respond a deluge of common customer questions about eligibility side effects needed documentation and more. This freed up their human agents to handle more complicated issues. This is an extreme example but as we shift back to a new “normal” we see conversational AI playing a massive role in ensuring information direction and overall engagement is streamlined between the brand and the consumer.

Another area that we think is particularly ripe for disruption with conversational AI is in employee experience and productivity. Many organizations today are facing skills and labor shortages and they are looking for ways to free up their employees to focus on higher value tasks. Conversational AI can play a key role in this space. Many employees in fields like HR sales and marketing are constantly bogged down with repetitive tasks like scheduling meetings updating calendars requesting agendas sending reminders etc. With an intelligent automation solution that can be controlled using natural language employees can automate these repetitive tasks and reclaim their time to focus on what matters most.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2F1dG9tYXRpb24vdGhlLWVtZXJnZW5jZS1vZi10aGUtY2hpZWYtYXV0b21hdGlvbi1vZmZpY2VyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The emergence of the chief automation officer,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://venturebeat.com/automation/the-emergence-of-the-chief-automation-officer/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2F1dG9tYXRpb24vdGhlLWVtZXJnZW5jZS1vZi10aGUtY2hpZWYtYXV0b21hdGlvbi1vZmZpY2VyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdydW5nZS5jb20vOTczMDA1L3RoZS13b3JsZHMtc21hbGxlc3QtY29tcHV0ZXItaXMtc21hbGxlci10aGFuLXlvdS10aGluay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The World's Smallest Computer Is Smaller Than You Think,"The World's Smallest Computer Is Smaller Than You Think

IBM and the University of Michigan have had an ongoing competition for who can create the world's smallest computer. As of June 2018 Michigan is winning. That month the university unveiled a new micro-computer 10 times smaller than IBM's. It's about .3 mm in length per side far smaller than a grain of rice (via The University of Michigan).

Despite its tiny size the computer has random-access memory a processor and wireless transmitters and receivers. They receive and transmit data using visible light rather than radio antennae as is conventionally used because they're too small for the antennae to fit (via The University of Michigan). According to Digital Trends the computer also has a base station that along with an LED transmission light gives the computer power. The light is converted to electricity via a process called photovoltaics.

According to the university to achieve this Michigan engineers had to create a new type of circuit that's low-power but can tolerate light. The light from the base station and LED light create the circuit's currents. They also had to make sure the computer's readings were highly accurate despite the low power. Three Michigan professors of electrical and computer engineering worked on developing the computer: David Blaauw Dennis Sylvester and Jamie Phillips."

The Intel 14th Gen Meteor Lake CPUs are scheduled for release in 2023 and will come with a range of new features including brand new hybrid cores integrated graphics using tiled- designs and a VPU accelerator which we talked about in our last coverage.

Intel Meteor Lake CPUs With TGPU Design Reportedly Comes With Ray Tracing & FP64 Support But Lacks XMX Units

According to a detailed report published by Coelacanth-Dream it looks like the GPU featured on the Intel Meteor Lake CPUs is detected as a Xe-HPG product within IGC (Intel Graphics Compiler). Considering that we can assume that it will be using the same architecture as the existing DG2 or Alchemist GPUs but that's not entirely the case.

The Meteor Lake GPU which is also known as tGPU (Tiled-GPU) does not support DPAS (Dot Product Accumulate Systolic) instructions executed through the XMX units because it reportedly is not equipped with those. In a previous report we covered how Intel's Meteor Lake CPU's graphics unit would lack XMX resulting in lower feature-level support for technologies such as XeSS but it will instead feature partial FP64 support something that's been missing in Intel iGPUs for the past few generations.

The more interesting detail is that the TGPU (Xe-MTL) on the Intel Meteor Lake CPUs is reportedly going to come with hardware-level raytracing support. The TGPU is said to offer the same level of ray-tracing support as Alchemist and Ponte Vecchio GPUs since there's no change in the design at least as far as ray tracing is concerned.

Regarding support for HW ray tracing on Meteor Lake GPUs IGC/AdaptorCommon/RayTracing/PrologueShaders.cpp  it IGFX_METEORLAKE is believed that they support it because of the addition of . Other than that in the code part that determines his HW ray tracing support it seems that Meteor Lake GPU supports it as well as Alchemist / DG2 and Ponte Vechhio because there is no change. via Coelacanth-Dream

Intel's Meteor Lake CPU tiled-GPU won't be the first integrated graphics chip to offer support for ray-tracing. AMD has been offering it for almost a year now with their Ryzen 6000 ""Rembrandt"" APUs that feature RDNA 2 iGPUs. This will be Intel's first ray-tracing-enabled integrated graphics but we hope that some partial XeSS or AI-level upsampling support is added. As we have seen with AMD's APUs technologies such as FSR 2.0 can really help deliver playable FPS in gaming titles and that would be really awesome for mobile gamers.

He continued to lament that America had “now become one of those countries corrupt at a level not seen before”.

Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr chimed in on Twitter with the assessment: “This is what you see happen in 3rd World Banana Republics!!!” Never mind that the FBI’s seizure of secret documents does not fit the “corruption” bill quite as well as some other characteristics of American democracy: say the fact that non-taxpaying billionaires can be president or that the country is run as a crooked oligarchic corporatocracy.

This is not the first time Trump has likened the US to a “third-world country” which was also his epithet of choice when he lost the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden. But Trump & Co are not the only members of the US ruling elite to exercise this vocabulary. The January 2021 attack on the US Capitol prompted a surge in pejorative “third world” and “banana republic” comparisons from everyone from Biden to George W Bush former US leader and civilised ravager of Afghanistan and Iraq.

Indeed it is impossible to understate the bipartisan imperial hubris that is on display in the casual deployment of such lingo. By implicitly and unironically mocking underdeveloped nations the US political establishment appears to have conveniently forgotten the country’s own historical role in creating the “banana republic” phenomenon in the first place — and in ensuring that the “third world” remains you know “third”.

The term “banana republic” was coined in 1904 by American writer O Henry in reference to the Central American nation of Honduras which like neighbouring Guatemala was an early victim of predatory US capitalism and corporate exploitation. The economic and physical wellbeing of the inhabitants of such lowly nations was naturally of no concern to the hemispheric behemoth which ensured its unfettered access to regional resources by backing right-wing coups bloody civil wars corrupt dictatorships and death squads — in other words stuff that was slightly more devastating than an FBI search of Mar-a-Lago.

The Cold War of course provided a handy alibi for US-backed killing worldwide from Nicaragua to Angola — while also spawning the “third-world” designation that would go on to accrue patronising connotations. Once the communist menace had been replaced with the terrorist menace as the primary US excuse for lethal international interference the remaining global superpower continued to extend a charitable hand to the impoverished “third world” — often via a form of corporate neocolonialism cast as “development”.

And while Trump’s recent tantrum about the US as a “broken third-world” country can certainly be filed under the expansive category of Distastefully Kooky Things Trump Has Said there is also an unintended element of truth to it. Like it or not the US fits the third-world stereotype in many respects — and not just in terms of its oligarchic style of governance.

The US advertises itself as being at the vanguard of global “development” but the nation’s healthcare poverty and other indicators suggest a policy of wilful counterdevelopment instead. Back in 2017 Philip Alston the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights visited the US for two weeks. At the end of his trip he issued a statement on how he found the country “exceptional in … ways that are shockingly at odds with its immense wealth and its founding commitment to human rights”.

Despite managing to spend more money on “national defence” than China Russia the United Kingdom and a bunch of other big spenders combined the US had some “40 million people” living in poverty amid glaring “contrasts between private wealth and public squalor”.

As Alston noted the US was also “alone among developed countries” in insisting that human rights did “not include rights that guard against dying of hunger dying from a lack of access to affordable healthcare or growing up in a context of total deprivation”. So much for that line from the US Declaration of Independence about “inalienable” rights to “life liberty and the pursuit of happiness”. It’s hard to pursue anything if you’re dead.

Speaking of death infant mortality rates in the US are higher than in Cuba an island that has spent more than 60 years under an asphyxiating US embargo. Trump himself imposed no fewer than 243 new sanctions against the Cubans — as punishment for their crime of pursuing national sovereignty over the “banana republic” model — and for good measure threw Cuba back on the US list of state sponsors of terrorism.

Back in the land of the free meanwhile homelessness has reached ghastly levels unseen even in many “underdeveloped” countries and the US has long maintained the highest incarceration rate in the world — although it may have recently been surpassed by El Salvador another place where US support for “human rights” has involved backing right-wing state terror.

Such is the ironic nature of imperial power it seems that the global hegemon responsible for oppressing much of the third world must also keep a significant portion of its own populace in third-world conditions.

As per Trump’s twisted logic any attempt to hold him accountable for anything is evidence that the US is a “corrupt” and “broken third-world” country. And while there’s no sense in wasting time on Trumpian delusion we might nonetheless take the opportunity to recall that old saying about the broken clock — and to acknowledge that the US is definitively broken.

Latest news on ETFs Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools

Exchange traded funds are proving a rare ray of light for under-fire active fund managers as mutual funds are decimated by a toxic cocktail of investment losses and unprecedented outflows.

Globally investors pulled a net $640bn from actively managed mutual funds in the first half of the year according to figures from Morningstar a far cry from inflows of $943bn in 2021. Combined with market falls these outflows sent total assets spinning 19.6 per cent lower to $23.9tn.

However the far smaller but more nascent active ETF industry managed to attract a net $51.8bn in the same period according to Morningstar in line with its 2021 run rate. Even factoring in market losses aggregate assets have still managed to tick up 1.2 per cent to $385bn.

Demand for active ETFs is holding up even better than for passive funds with global flows into passive mutual funds and ETFs in H1 at $431bn less than a third of 2021’s full-year tally.

“There has been a general trend away from mutual funds towards equity ETFs more broadly and active ETFs have very much participated in that move” said Chris Gooch head of ETF and index sales Emea at Citi.

Elisabeth Kashner director of global fund analytics at FactSet a data provider believed that in the US by far the largest market for active ETFs the rise of these beasts was “structural”.

Kashner said growth had been stimulated by the “ETF rule” introduced by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2019 which was designed to stimulate competition in the industry by streamlining the process of bringing ETFs to market.

A second driver was the SEC’s approval the same year of non-transparent and semi-transparent structures which allowed active managers to avoid having to disclose the full contents of their funds on a daily basis allowing them to keep some of their “secret sauce”.

More recently still the rise of active ETFs has been catalysed by some fund houses such as Dimensional Fund Advisors and JPMorgan converting existing mutual funds into ETFs.

Another factor is the adverse tax treatment mutual fund investors investing outside tax-exempt structures receive in the US — they not only have to pay capital gains tax when they exit a position but are also taxed when their fund has to sell winning positions because other investors have exited.

Due to a quirk in their structure ETFs are immune to this latter element although this can lead to higher tax bills when investors do sell.

Although the accelerating pace of fund conversions is an increasingly important part of the story in the US they do not explain the full picture.

While the combined assets of active equity ETFs in the US rose by 35.5 per cent in the first six months of 2022 FactSet said growth was still 23.1 per cent when conversions were stripped out.

“There are a lot of asset managers that have determined that the ETF is the path forward the way of growing their business or slowing the decay of their business so there has been a big push from the management side” Kashner said.

However as she pointed out all of this explains rising supply but it “doesn’t explain why people have bought” active ETFs.

On the demand side of the equation she said Dimensional which attracted 54.4 per cent of net flows into active ETFs targeting the broad US stock market had “a very loyal following especially among the adviser community”.

Dimensional also has lower fees for its ETFs than its comparable mutual funds — a common scenario reflecting the lower cost of running an ETF — and advisers’ fiduciary duty “is to go into the lowest-cost product”.

Moreover Kashner believed asset managers that offered both types of vehicle were increasingly “turning their marketing muscle on their ETF product”.

“[Active ETFs] are another space” said Kenneth Lamont senior fund analyst for passive strategies at Morningstar. “Active management has been squeezed. It’s trying to find new ways to invent itself. There is a lot of incentive and a lot of money behind finding a way to make active work.

“It’s a new marketing tool a way to present yourself to a new audience. It’s opportunistic it’s active managers trying to piggyback on the growth of ETFs.”

Amin Rajan chief executive of Create Research a think-tank believed “a lot” of the growth was driven by institutional investors.

“They want to remain as liquid as they possibly can. At the same time if there are any themes they want to pursue ETFs really provide a great opportunity to capitalise on any momentum that is happening.

“Its very much part of a structural change moving away from mutual funds” Rajan added. “It’s happening globally but it’s much more noticeable in the US.”

Gooch believed the trend had much further to run. “ETFs won’t completely replace mutual funds or other wrappers such as direct indexing but there is much further to go with active ETFs still only representing a small percentage of the overall ETF market” he said.

The relative success of active ETFs may help asset managers’ bottom lines less than they might have hoped however.

In the US active total equity market ETF sector issuers whose fees averaged 0.16 per cent or less attracted three-quarters of inflows in H1 FactSet found led by Dimensional’s cheap offerings with those charging 0.4 per cent or more accounting for just 11 per cent of flows.

The contingency of warming effects on plant biomass via soil moisture (Supplementary Fig. 5) might be one of the primary reasons for the upregulation of R/S in many study sites except for the tundra and alpine biomes where soils are often frozen1732. Even in the studies with decreased total plant biomass in response to warming we found that belowground biomass allocations were higher than aboveground ones (Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7)3334. Such a plant strategy can have important implications for soil carbon dynamics potentially due to a lower turnover rate of root-associated carbon (i.e. carbon in hyphae and root per se) compared to shoot-associated carbon3334. Biomes with lower original R/S at ambient conditions showed greater allocation to belowground biomass when warming most likely had induced greater demand for resources35 agreeing with our hypothesis of horizontal homogenization of R/S across biomes in a warmer world (Fig. 1). We suspect that the upregulated R/S due to warming might alter the carbon transfer between atmosphere and soil2136.

More specifically our results suggest that in areas with mean annual precipitation (MAP) lower than ∼900 mm warmed air and soil surface could induce greater belowground biomass allocation potentially for plants to exploit resources in deeper soil layers where water is more readily available and temperature is cooler (Fig. 7a)37. The long-term adaptation of plants to water deficiency e.g. a higher water use efficiency ensures more biomass accumulation under warmed conditions thereby triggering an upregulation of R/S (Fig. 7a and prolonging the C residence time in plants38. In areas with MAP greater than ∼900 mm adequate soil moisture could enable positive effects of warming on nutrient turnover and availability e.g. soil NH 4 + and NO 3 − for AMF and EMF respectively (Fig. 7b)1539. Indeed the allocation to belowground biomass in these areas declined consequently in our meta-analysis but only for terrestrial plants associated with AMF (Fig. 7b)40.

The regulation of MAP on R/S under warmed conditions was mainly through the adjustment of belowground biomass accumulation (Supplementary Fig. 3) which responded to variable effects of warming on soil moisture among plant functional types (PFTs Supplementary Fig. 6)1241. Significant changes in belowground biomass (BGB) in response to warming indeed varied among PFTs compared to other categories used in our meta-analysis (Supplementary Table 5). Woody plants which are characterized by deeper and evolutionarily mature roots42 can redistribute soil water by hydraulic lift supporting an increment in BGB under warmed conditions (Fig. 5)43. Herbaceous plants which are characterized by evolutionarily younger roots relative to woody plants can potentially adjust root traits (e.g. specific root length) more readily than biomass1241. These warming-induced changes in root traits may have contributed to their non-significant responses in terms of BGB under warmed conditions (Fig. 5). In addition to MAP due to interaction between temperature and soil moisture antecedent mean annual temperature (MAT) was another important background climatic factor influencing the response of R/S in our meta-analysis44. For instance MAT displayed a negative relationship with R/S due to a warming-induced significant increment of aboveground biomass (AGB) in most of the biomes with MAT < 13 °C and plants associated with EMF (Supplementary Table 3)45.

Plant’s association with mycorrhizal fungi further regulated biomass allocation patterns of terrestrial plants in response to warming. The response of R/S to warming among 164 vascular host plants displayed a significant phylogenetic signal (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 2) whereas significant differences were not found between evergreen vs. deciduous trees broad vs. coniferous trees annual vs. perennial plants and angiosperms vs. gymnosperms (Supplementary Table 4). Although both arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF-) and ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF-) associated plants exhibited an overall increase in R/S the underlying mechanisms are likely to be different (Figs. 5 7). Benefiting from hydrolytic and oxidative extracellular enzymes produced by the hyphae of EMF46 EMF-associated plants are capable of growing better under nutrient-deficient conditions relative to AMF-associated plants1345. EMF-associated plants showed an increasing trend of AGB BGB and R/S under warming (Fig. 5) likely due to hyphal-facilitated soil organic matter (SOM) degradation and root nutrient absorption47. By contrast AMF-associated plants are often more abundant in warmer sites (e.g. in temperate grasslands and deciduous forests) with drier soils48495051. Although AMF association correlated with greater water use efficiency in plants under warmed conditions (WUE Supplementary Fig. 7) AMF-associated plants seemed to slow down the shoot biomass accumulation due to warming-induced soil water deficiency (mainly in grasses Supplementary Fig. 9)52 and the potential increment of plant-derived carbon to AMF53. Interestingly the regulation of mycorrhizal fungi types on responses of R/S to warming were mainly related to shoot biomass but not to root biomass (Fig. 6) implying the important roles of mycorrhizal associations on aboveground biomass allocation in terrestrial plants in a warmer world245455.

As for biomes with mixed AMF and EMF (AM-EMF Fig. 5 Supplementary Fig. 8) the complementary resource use (e.g. water and nutrients) between plants with arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal fungi provides a plausible explanation for the observed stability of R/S and higher productivity in response to warming (Fig. 4)5657. As we did not find any significant differences in plant biomass allocation (R/S) or biomass itself (AGB and BGB) to warming between evergreen vs. deciduous trees broad vs. coniferous trees annual vs. perennial plants or angiosperms vs. gymnosperms (Supplementary Table 4) when we ignored the types of mycorrhizal fungi in our analysis it further confirms the importance of plants’ association with mycorrhizal fungi in understanding their biomass responses to warming compared to many other plant biotic characteristics.

We suspect that a stronger association of warming effects on biomass allocation with MAP and mycorrhizal associations could potentially lead to a redistribution of R/S in the horizontal dimension with more homogenization and lower variability of biomass allocation patterns among diverse biomes (Fig. 1)58. Although we found some clear signals in how warming effects were observed through a greater allocation of root biomass in terrestrial plants relative to shoot biomass we caution readers about the variability in effect sizes which could be caused by the distinct effect of warming magnitude and warming duration in a given biome (Supplementary Table 3). For example warming magnitude might negatively affect the response of R/S for biomes with EMF while warming duration could induce negative and positive effects for biomes with woody and herbaceous plants respectively as revealed in our analysis (Supplementary Table 3).

In summary climate warming with a mean magnitude of 2.5 °C can enhance belowground biomass allocation as a whole but mainly so in drier habitats. The warming of 2.5 °C also resembles the predicted IPCC warming (2.4 °C rise of global mean temperature) under a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5) in the following decades (2041–2060)59 making our results further relevant for the future of terrestrial carbon dynamics. Our results highlight that habitat dryness (or wetness) and types of mycorrhizal association are crucial factors to consider when we aim to predict biomass allocation strategies in terrestrial plants in response to warming across biomes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc3AubmdvL2Fib3V0LXVzL2luc3Atbm9ydGgtYW1lcmljYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,INSP North America,"INSP North America is a program working to support new and existing street papers in Canada Mexico and the United States.

Few can disagree.

The significance is profound for these governing long-standing HBCU sports entities founded over 100 years ago — Central Intercollegiate Athletic Conference in 1912 and Southwestern Athletic Conference in 1920. Corporate America and major broadcast networks have ignored or failed to recognize the economic benefit of affiliating with HBCU conferences.

For example State Farm Procter & Gamble United Wells Fargo Invesco QQQ Tyson Foods and Cricket Wireless are a few corporations that sponsored HBCU-related sporting events. Nevertheless the record with the three and four-letter broadcast networks has an underwhelming track record with HBCUs — for many a year.

AN HBCU GO-TYPE PARTNERSHIP 'LONG OVERDUE'

The SWAC arrangement with HBCU GO is a ""long-term partnership to amplify and grow the sports floor program"" Byron Allen told me. ""This is the long overdue support to help them get the exposure the revenue they need to help fund these programs the schools and ultimately the education of these kids. It's a very important deal and historic deal.""

For HBCU conferences history may point back to 2022 as when media outlets began acknowledging the value of partnering with the brands of Jackson State Florida A&M Grambling Southern Howard Southern or South Carolina State. Then again eradicating the years of disenfranchisement by the suits on Madison Avenue would require the commissioners presidents and athletic directors to make transformational decisions for these brands.

HBCUs have had three choices served to them over the years. One we won't do business with you. Two we will pacify you with a spattering of support - just enough to keep you quiet. Third the corporate boardrooms will invite HBCUs to the table and strike new lucrative deals.

Question. Are we there yet?

COMPARE OR NOT COMPARE THAT IS THE QUESTION

After this week's mega-announcement of the Big 10's $7 billion television rights deal with FOX CBS and NBC are the HBCU conferences on the precipice of leaping into similar long-term accords?

The media mogul remarked how he was ""very proud of"" inking the multi-year contract with the SWAC but would not disclose the financial terms of the new alliance. ""I can't share the details. But it is a long-term partnership that we are both [SWAC and HBCU GO] very excited about"" Allen stated.

One source told me it's a 10-year $120 million agreement between the SWAC and HBCU GO. I contacted the SWAC conference office to verify the details. A representative would only confirm that the SWAC signed a multi-year distribution contract with Allen's free-streaming platform.

Allen affirmed a few particulars from our first conversation in February 2022. ""We did a deal with them [SWAC] for over 2000 live-sporting events. That's football men's and women's basketball men's and women's volleyball other sports; it's everything the entire spectrum.""

HOW HBCUs WILL BE WATCHED WITH HBCU GO CBS

On August 16 Allen Media Group officially announced after signing separate distribution partnerships with the SWAC and CIAA that HBCU GO will distribute the conferences' content via CBS-owned-and-operated duopoly stations. Also HBCU GO has secured distribution with group-owned television stations including Nexstar Gray Cox Scripps Tegna Sinclair Lockwood Allen Media Broadcasting Hearst Circle City Broadcasting McKinnon Broadcasting Cowles Graham Block Sun Broadcasting Tougaloo College Sagamore Hill and Marquee.

""These games will be some of the very first games that will be on digital broadcast and cable simultaneously"" Allen noted. ""So this will be on the streaming app HBCU GO and the Grio streaming app Local Now SPORTS.TV and over-the-air broadcast. That's the syndication we've put together to align them for broadcast television stations with CBS being the lead group. Nexstar Gray Cox Scripps Tegna Sinclair Lockwood Allen Media Broadcasting Hearst Circle City Broadcasting McKinnon Broadcasting Cowles Graham Block Sun Broadcasting Tougaloo College Sagamore Hill and Marquee and our cable network. The Grio has 50 plus million homes available to 50 plus million homes.""

A few weeks ago AMG (Allen Media Group) acquired the Black News Channel (BCN) and its assets for a reported $11 million out of bankruptcy. Allen converted and merged BCN into The Grio. ""Anybody who wants to see an HBCU game will not have any problems accessing them via digital via over-the-air broadcast and via cable. It's 100% penetration across the board collectively"" Allen declared.

HBCU GO's IMPACT AND REACH FOR THE SWAC AND CIAA

The SWAC and CIAA grant HBCU GO the rights to their conferences' sporting events to broadcast via cable linear streaming broadcast VOD [video-on-demand} and pay-per-view. Syndication becomes a possibility for HBCU GO to be packaged in future deals for distribution on other networks. For clarity neither AMG Allen nor the SWAC verified with HBCU Legends that the conferences would or would not receive revenue from syndication of their content on HBCU GO.

Byron Allen mentioned the CBS deal would place HBCU GO in ""approximately 60% of all US households and approximately 67% of all African American households.""

The HBCU GO platform will have a global reach for HBCU sports fans to access games and events.

Even Jackson State's head coach understands how this will impact the families of the young men on his football team. Deion Sanders was very candid with Allen and told him ""We need some support. These young kids are here and they want their mamas to see them play. So we're help them to make sure their mamas can see them play"" Allen exclaimed.

ARE HBCUs NOW IN A POSITION OF POWER?

""We've gone from zero to now a deal has been done. Is it a multi-billion dollar deal? It is not. Have they [HBCUs] been there and available for over a century and decades? Yes. Have they been ignored? Yes. We are starting the process of reversing that.""

Allen continued ""The greatest trade deficit in America is the trade deficit between White corporate America and Black America. Why is it that Byron Allen in 2022 becomes the first person to take the sports content put it on digital broadcast and cable and push the conversation to provide distribution and economic inclusion for the HBCUs? Some pretty big corporations out there that didn't seem to care before now.""

He's correct. HBCUs are now sexy for the advertising agencies to seek new partnerships and promote the so-called ""black agenda"" to their clients' consumers. As compelling as it seems business and profitability must become the central concerns for the SWAC CIAA MEAC CIAC and other HBCU conferences and their member institutions.

Should HBCUs and their fans applaud these deals today later or at all?

It's not for me to say.

One thing is clear. Now is the time for the conferences to capitalize and take a position of power to dictate the new partnership terms. If they do not it will be same ol' business as usual for historically black colleges and universities.

In our conversation Byron Allen told me that Dr. Martin Luther King's widow Coretta Scott King once shared this wise statement. ""The greatest weapon we have is the truth.""

Will the truth set HBCUs free to control and navigate the economics of their media rights and future deals? Will commissioners Dr. Charles McClelland (SWAC) and Jacqie McWilliams (CIAA) keep their respective conferences protected and profitable? And will HBCU GO help to revolutionize HBCU sports in the SWAC and CIAA? Once again Byron Allen believes it would.

The weekly chart of Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 QQQ shows a strong rally off the June 15 bottom and is now hitting major Fibonacci resistance at both the 50% and 61.8% retracement levels from the recent high and pullback.

The next two weeks will be very important to determine how the NASDAQ 100 and other major indices will play out directionally given the earnings macroeconomic and geopolitical catalysts in the near-term.

The price action is showing there is a twin tower candle pattern setup with the 20-week simple moving average (SMA) that is currently flattening out. If the price action finds support at the 20-week SMA in the next few sessions and bounces then further upside is possible.

However from the opposing perspective this has all the hallmarks of a traditional harmonic ABCD pattern to the downside. The initial ABCD was made from the recent high to low (Jan. 3 – June 15) which also corresponds to the longer AB leg and a descending wedge pattern.

More recently the price action is within the longer BC leg. If the price action were to reverse the 200-week SMA (orange line on chart) would act as the first area of support and if the trend continues thereafter traders and investors would see a potential move lower.

Bitcoin has seen 3 legs lower on the daily time frame since its April highs where the 200-day SMA acted as strong resistance. As of late the price action has been in a major consolidation phase since mid-June and Friday’s price action saw a large red Maruboza candle off the 20-day SMA which history suggest has an over 80% chance of follow through to the downside.

A simple rule of thumb is within a trending market 3-5 legs are created in the direction of the current trend around 70% of the time before a potential reversal.

Taking a peek at the weekly chart Friday’s price action gave a strong signal for potential further downside as a bearish engulfing candle was made and broke below both the 200-week SMA.

Price is still within the upper 50% of the consolidating range but a continued breakdown below the 200-week SMA could signal a potential free fall and mass liquidation by institutions. The longer term ABCD pattern to the downside is still intact.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vc3RvY2tuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3FxcS1hYXBsLW1zZnQtdnhuLXZpeC1ob3ctb3B0aW9uLXByaWNlcy1jYW4taGVscC1wcmVkaWN0LWZ1dHVyZS1zdG9jay1wcmljZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,QQQ: How Option Prices Can Help Predict Future Stock Prices,"I highlighted last week some reasons why I thought stocks and particularly QQQ had finally formed a significant top in my latest commentary for POWR Options. One of the biggest reasons why the NASDAQ looks tired and toppy was complacency-which was reflected in the form of option prices.

Most of you are probably very familiar with the VIX-sometimes called the “Fear Index”. The VIX is a general measure of 30-day option prices on the S&P 500. It tends to spike when stock prices fall sharply and usually falls when stock prices rise.

VXN or Vixen is a similar measure of 30-day option prices using the NASDAQ 100 (QQQ) instead of the S&P 500 (SPY). Let’s take a look at how using the VXN as a market timing tool can help call significant short-term tops in the market. It is the equivalent of the Warren Buffett adage that says to “Be Fearful When Others Are Greedy.”

VXN sell signals are generated when VXN makes at least a 33% pullback from the previous high and then makes a reversal off the lows. Over the past 12 months there have been 6 such sell signals generated (highlighted in aqua on the chart below)

Below is the same time period 1 year chart of the QQQ. Note how the bottoms in VXN correspond precisely with the tops in QQQ (highlighted in red) .

I put together a quick snapshot summary of the VXN based sell signal methodology over the past year shown in the table below.

Price of sell Subsequent low Gain % gain Date of low Days to low 8/31/2021 379.95 352.62 27.33 7.19% 10/4/2021 34 11/5/2021 398.6 380.69 17.91 4.49% 12/20/2021 45 1/4/2022 396.47 341.4 55.07 13.89% 1/27/2022 23 2/10/2022 358.43 318.17 40.26 11.23% 3/14/2022 32 4/5/2022 361.1 291.15 69.95 19.37% 5/12/2022 37 6/8/2022 307.4 271.39 36.01 11.71% 6/16/2022 8 11.32% 29.83

The average pullback over the past six sell signals has been just over 11%. It has taken about a month (29.83 days on average) for stocks to find a subsequent bottom after the sell signal was generated.

Just as importantly the sell signals never really were too early or wrong in calling a short-term top. None of the prior six signals would have caused any subsequent angst by using the VXN methodology as a market timing tool. Indeed only one of the signals had a minor unrealized loss after taking a short position in the QQQ. The other five were pretty much spot on in calling the top.

Using the VXN methodology means the market will tell you when it is time to act. This can be important as many time fundamental analysis and technical analysis can be way too early…which in this market environment makes it difficult to hang on to a losing position for too long.

That’s not to say that fundamentals and other factors aren’t important as confirming indicators to take a bearish stance.

Both valuations and seasonality are also pointing to the probabilities favoring a pullback.

The two biggest market cap stocks in the NASDAQ 100 (QQQ) are Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). Both reached the highest multiples on a Price/Sales basis over the past three months before softening. Plus having 2 trillion-dollar plus market cap companies trading at such lofty valuations seems extreme unto itself. Further upside seems limited at best.

Seasonality supports the bearish argument as well.

Over the past twelve years September has been the only down month for QQQ. Shares have shown gains less than half the time with an average loss of 1%. Every other month is positive on both performance and number of up months versus down months.

Comparative performance is also favoring a bigger pullback for QQQ versus SPY. Normally QQQ and SPY tend to be highly correlated. Over the past few months however QQQ has out-performed SPY to a large degree. Look for this correlation to revert back to the mean with QQQ beginning to under-perform to close that gap.

Comparative lows in the VXN also means option prices on the QQQ are comparatively cheap. This favors buying puts to take a defined risk short position. Exactly the type of strategy we use week-in and week-out in the POWR Options Portfolio.

So traders looking to take a short position for the short-term would be best served buying puts versus shorting QQQ outright. Limited risk with potentially explosive returns. Plus an increase in implied volatility generally will be a benefit to the long put position as well.

Nicknamed “COVID-pandemic’s favourite snack” and the source of multiple social media memes Dolo-650 mg which registered a sales of over ₹500 crores during the COVID pandemic since March 2020 is back in the news following the public interest litigation in Supreme Court by the Federation of Medical and Sales Representatives Association of India (FMRAI) a national trade union that sought enforcement of Right to Life under Article 21 of the Constitution.

In its petition FMRAI has alleged mounting instances of unethical marketing practices by pharma companies in their dealings with healthcare professionals which in turn has a negative effect on the health of those who are already unwell.

“The existing code is voluntary and unethical practices will continue to proliferate. The ultimate sufferer is the ailing patient for whom we are fighting. We demand that all essential medicines be brought under price control and be made tax free. This will ensure that patients are directly benefited. No one should die for want of medicines’’ said Santanu Chatterjee of FMRAI.

“This current case is certainly not about Dolo-650 alone. It is just one of the examples cited. Paracetamol is one of the examples that we have referred to in the petition that was filed some years ago. We are working for bringing in regulations that would stop malpractice in the pharma industry’’ said Aparna Bhat advocate for FMRAI.

The advocate explained that government price control is applicable till 500 mg of the paracetamol salt. “The idea of Dolo-650 and freebie caught on because it is so widely used especially during COVID. Also it was in the news in July’’ she added.

As per data available with IQVIA a healthcare research firm Dolo-650 mg registered sales of ₹28.9 crore in December 2021 up 61.45% from the same month the previous year. Its highest sales figures are from April and May 2021 when it witnessed sales of ₹48.9 crore and ₹44.2 crore respectively. The growth was when the country was witnessing the second wave of COVID.

Dolo-650 is one brand of paracetamol also known as acetaminophen and used to treat fever and mild to moderate pain. It is manufactured by Micro Labs Ltd. and is no different from other brands like Crocin Calpol Pacimol etc. However unlike Dolo-650 mg most other brands sell their paracetamol brand with 500 mg salt. Data from IQVIA also show that Dolo-650 and Calpol (manufactured by GSK Pharmaceuticals) are the key brands driving the paracetamol segment.

In all there are over 30 brands of paracetamol that are top-sellers in different regions of India.

Unethical practices

While the Supreme Court is now scheduled to take up the matter on September 29 earlier this month the National Medical Commission (NMC) sought details from the Income Tax Department of doctors who allegedly received freebies from six pharma companies including Dolo-650 maker Micro Labs against whom raids were conducted last month.

The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) the administrative body for the I-T department in July had accused the makers of the widely-used Dolo-650 tablet of indulging in “unethical practices” and distributing freebies of about ₹1000 crore to doctors and medical professionals in exchange for promoting its products.

The Income Tax department had on July 6 raided 36 premises of Bengaluru-based Micro Labs Ltd. across nine states.

‘Still safe to use’

A recent study by Future Market Insights (FMI) notes that the global acetaminophen market is expected to grow to over US$ 14.1 billion by 2031 from the US$ 9.4 billion in 2021. In such a market Dolo-650’s popularity comes with the fact that it is one of three-four familiar brands that contain the drug paracetamol what with Dolo having been around for almost three decades said Dr. Rajeev Jayadevan co-chairman national Indian Medical Association COVID task force.

“A specific advantage of Dolo 650 is that if a single tablet is taken up to three times a day it comes well under the safe limit of 4 g per 24 hours. (More number of pills might be needed if the 500 mg strength tablet is used). So it is convenient for adults of average build and weight. I understand other leading brands also released ads about their own 650 mg versions apparently after seeing the popularity of this particular dose during the pandemic’’ he explained.

Meanwhile paracetamol is considered a safe drug to use within the recommended dosage. “However in some cases you may experience side effects such as nausea vomiting indigestion diarrhoea stomach pain etc. Consult your doctor if these symptoms stay for a long time or if they become severe’’ noted experts.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In the past twenty years Langfonne has dramatically retreated. Its current size is less than 30% of what it was 20 years ago. The retreat is evident from the surroundings. The ice is surrounded by bedrock devoid of lichen and moss and is a light gray color. Three distinct ice patches have formed from the split ice. Only 10% of the Little Ice Age’s maximum ice cover remains at Langfonne today (AD 1450-1920). The melting of Langfonne is a part of a much larger global warming-related pattern of retreating mountain glaciers that includes glaciers in Norway and other countries.

However the Langfonne ice patch is the ice site in the world with the most arrows.

Photo: The secret of the Ice Facebook page.

The arrow was discovered in a collection of broken rock fragments between larger stones on the lower edge of the icefield.

The team believes that the arrow was lost and deposited downslope by meltwater and that it has since been exposed several times by melting ice over the centuries.

This is indicated by the lack of fletching the fin-shaped aerodynamic stabilization normally made from feathers or bark. Evidence of sinew and tar has also been identified but this survives in a poor state of preservation. The arrow is tapered towards the end and the nock has been thickened for engaging with a bowstring. The remains of the tar would have glued the fletching to the shaft while imprints of the thread securing the fletching are still visible.

In recent years the team has found numerous arrows in the region during the Late Neolithic (2400-1750 BC) and especially during the Late Iron Age (AD 550-1050).

Photo: The secret of the Ice Facebook page.

The team found another arrow earlier this year in the Jotunheimen mountains which dates from around 1700 years ago. This arrow was found complete with its iron arrowhead sinew wrappings and aerodynamic feather fletching.

The project also discovered the best-preserved example of prehistoric skis a Bronze Age shoe and a lost Viking settlement containing sleds dead animals clothing and household items in melting ice patches.

On either side of her an animation of the sun and the earth slowly rotated and the screens swiftly seamlessly closed after she stepped out to sing her first song of the night “Nat King Cole.”

The audience erupted with cheers cell phones popping into the air. Keys instantly commanded the crowd before she sang a note or struck a single piano key at her concert Friday night in Cleveland.

Sure she was standing in front of an audience of 5000 but the singer also found ways to get in front of most attendees. She popped up at a small side stage next to the seated floor crowd for a few songs and later strutted her way around the venue’s main path to access every section of the audience.

Her unique approach to getting up close and personal with the crowd felt unconventional for a venue like Jacobs Pavilion. She said her philosophy on performing went back to a key piece of advice that Prince once gave her: “Keep it intimate. Keep it special.”

(I mean any time you see one of the most iconic versatile R&B pop singers of all time it’s going to be special.)

The 15-time Grammy award winner achieved icon status two decades ago when she released her debut album “Songs in A Minor” and has only impressed in her seven albums since. That included her pandemic-time releases 2020′s “Alicia” and 2021′s “Keys.”

Combined in the celebratory “Alicia + Keys” world tour Keys brought attention to the new tunes but also spanned plenty of fan-favorite hits from over the years.

There were plenty of years to cover. The last time Keys had performed in Cleveland was in 2004 on the “Verizon Ladies First” tour and in 2005 supporting 50 Cent according to setlist.fm records.

At her recent Cleveland stop Keys sang her impassioned hit songs “No One” “Falling” “Empire State of Mind” “Girl On Fire” and “If I Ain’t Got You” to a crowd that sang (and often screamed) along. She regularly sat at the piano showing off her prowess of the instrument meshing her performance with her talented backing band to create soulful jazz-tinged textures.

Other times her tunes got club-friendly remix treatment. Keys performed the “original” and “unlocked” versions of some of the songs from her latest album including “Skydive” and “Only You.” The flashy air horn-filled versions gave entire new flavors to Keys’ original songs. As the bass-heavy renditions thumped the singer twisted her arms into the air under flashing lights as though she herself were dancing in a nightclub.

Keys is an artist who’s always been able to command a lot of genres and a lot of audience. (Who could forget her show-stopping 2019 Grammys performance where she played two pianos at one time?)

The only puzzling part of Friday’s show was why Keys wasn’t playing somewhere bigger as she had in the past. The light show itself would have been perfectly at home in a venue like Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse or the Wolstein Center and the packed audience could have shown up at one of those venues with more force.

But then as she made her second reference to Prince of the night (“We’re here to celebrate this thing called life”) it became clear that Keys cared more about creating a memorable one-of-a-kind connection not only for her fans – but also for herself.

R&B singer Pink Sweat$ paired with an acoustic guitarist performed a mix of summery R&B songs ahead of Keys’ set. Often milking his time slot he asked the crowd to sing back to him clap with him and wave their arms in the air almost as much as he played music while a videographer hovered around him to capture every moment. Check out photos from his set below:

Contributed/Tom Stromme

GRAND FORKS – The merlin earned its place as bird of the week. On Tuesday evening when I was stewing about what bird to choose a merlin suddenly appeared. This was not surprising. Merlins have been increasing in Grand Forks and other cities on the Plains. Nevertheless its appearance was fortuitous because I must decide on a bird feature by Tuesday night in order to meet a deadline for a drawing and a column. That deadline is Wednesday afternoon with an occasional grace period until first thing Thursday. All of this for publication on Saturday.

So the bird must be present – or anticipated – and it must be expected to hang around at least until the paper reaches subscribers’ homes. The merlin qualifies.

Still the merlin is a bird of mystery.

It rather closely resembles another bird-eating raptor the Cooper’s hawk. Cooper’s hawks have increased dramatically in Grand Forks since about 2000 and the city has gained a reputation as a Cooper’s hawk hangout partly due to close observation and study by the regional raptor expert Tim Driscoll – he of peregrine fame.

In some ways the merlin is a smaller version of the peregrine. Both are falcons. A third falcon species is common here. This is the kestrel formerly called the sparrow hawk. Similarly the merlin was referred to as “the pigeon hawk.”

Neither of these names is appropriate. It’s true that kestrels might eat sparrows but they prefer small mammals. The merlin doesn’t eat pigeons but it does hunt smaller birds. The pigeon reference in its name refers to its size which roughly corresponds to the house pigeon more formally – and correctly – referred to as rock dove.

The size comparison really only applies to female merlins which are larger than males. This creates confusion in identification.

Re-enter the Cooper’s hawk. It is close in size to the female merlin and female merlins are paler in plumage which allows for additional confusion since Cooper’s hawks are generally lighter than male merlins.

There are ways to separate these two species at sight and I remind myself of them whenever I see either species. First the merlin is a stockier bird with a shorter tail. Of course size especially at a distance is never a definitive field mark. Better – but seen only close up – is the streaking on the belly of the birds. Merlins are streaked chest to tail. Cooper’s hawks are streaked from wing to wing. In my experience this is especially marked on male merlins.

The species fly slightly differently. Merlins are dashers – and fast ones at that. This adapts them to pursuit in open areas. Cooper’s hawks maneuver very well in wooded areas. They are fast and agile in pursuit.

Merlins present still another paradox. They have suddenly become common in our area. In the 1990s they were considered rare in our area. The American Ornithological Society’s monograph on the species leaves the whole eastern part of North Dakota absent of merlins.

It’s true that we here in the Red River Valley are close to the eastern edge of the merlin range but the species has been pressing eastward and occupying cities on the Plains. This is true of Cooper’s hawks too although they are coming from other directions – east and north.

The Cooper’s hawks got to town first. Merlins are more recent arrivals. For a couple of decades they’ve been present in some numbers in our area. It’s true that our area has been at the eastern edge of the merlin’s range but they have been pressing eastward and showing up in cities. My first “local sighting” was at Lake Ardoch National Wildlife Refuge in the early ’90s.

On Wednesday Aug. 17 I had an excuse for a road trip and I encountered three merlins two near Mekinock and one closer to Gilby N.D. (Yes this was a cross-country trip from Grand Forks to Magpie Ridge the country place we left to move into Grand Forks.) Merlins were consistent nesters in the last half decade in Wheatfield Township.

Both Cooper’s hawks and merlins are largely migratory but there is increasing evidence that both species spend the winter months here.

Late August brings a steady increase of species starting migration. The pool at Kellys Slough National Wildlife Refuge northwest of Grand Forks held at least 500 avocets Wednesday and I saw the first evidence of swallows massing for migration. In Grand Forks loose flocks of chipping sparrows have been flitting through the foliage along the Greenway. In nesting season these birds are generally seen individually.

On Wednesday afternoon a photo was captured of Pedro Pascal and Dakota Johnson kissing quite passionately on the streets of New York where Pascal was seen in a tan blazer and a brown dress shirt while Johnson wore a leather jacket over a white tee. Naturally the image of the two locking lips went viral leading fans to believe this was the sign of a new Hollywood relationship. Turns out it was all just a moment of movie magic.

The pair was caught smooching in TriBeCa as they filmed their new romantic comedy Materialists. Directed by Celine Song—whose debut feature film Past Lives was nominated for Best Picture this year—the upcoming flick follows the dynamic between a matchmaker a wealthy man she meets and her ex. In addition to Johnson and Pascal the movie also stars Chris Evans Zoë Winters Dasha Nekrasova Louisa Jacobson and Marin Ireland.

Materialists just began filming in New York in late April according to World of Reel. There is no confirmed release date yet but the movie is being distributed by A24 and produced by 2AM and Killer Films.

To make matters even more interesting about a week ago Johnson was seen filming a scene with costar Evans and in a few paparazzi photos the pair were captured kissing during their shoot as well. Materialists is clearly going to be a steamy film to say the least.

Johnson is fresh off the release of superhero film Madame Web while Evans just wrapped his Christmas action-comedy Red Ones which costars Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and is set to hit theaters on November 15. Meanwhile Pascal has a lot on his plate as he just finished filming Gladiator II in January and is also starring in the noir thriller Tropico which just began filming in April.

But there was more geniality than specificity in private meetings with Gov. J.B. Pritzker and legislative leaders just three weeks before a self-imposed May 24 spring session adjournment date.

Democrats were prepared to talk to Johnson about his Monday reference to $1 billion owed to Chicago Public Schools due to years of underfunding under the state’s school funding formula — but the issue wasn’t even broached during a nearly 30-minute meeting with the governor.

And the mayor’s controversial support for a new lakefront Chicago Bears stadium also wasn’t a focal point of the meeting.

Johnson told reporters he reminded Pritzker and legislative leaders that Chicago is the economic engine of the state and deserves its “fair share of resources.

“It’s also to continue to build relationships with the opportunity that we have in this moment as a state to really build the type of operation that speaks to equity injustice. This is a unique chance for us to do that” Johnson said of his trip. “So it’s a level-setting. It’s making sure that we’re building on relationships but it’s also clear that in order for the state of Illinois to be the great state that it is that the city of Chicago has to have its fair share of resources.”

Johnson called discussions with the Illinois General Assembly about the Bears “ongoing” dubbing Soldier Field a “structural damaged situation that really needs a solution.” The Bears last week met with Pritzker aides who highlighted their opposition to the plan. The governor’s office last week called the proposal a “nonstarter” after the meeting.

“And that’s what this is about providing solutions to a problem … like everything else I’ve inherited” Johnson said.

It was the Chicago mayor’s first trip to the state capitol since taking office. Johnson also met with Pritzker and legislative leaders in Springfield in April 2023 in a ceremonial visit weeks before he was sworn in.

Johnson defended the timing of his visit — and his late-in-the-game budgetary asks — saying “We’re at the right time.”

“You know when stuff gets done. So we’re down here at the right time” Johnson said.

Several members of the Chicago City Council Black Caucus also met privately with Illinois House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch on Wednesday in what was dubbed an informal city lobbying day. Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) the mayor’s hand-picked Education Committee chair said it marked the first time in five years that members of the caucus had come to Springfield.

“The thing we’ll do next year is we’ll come in January. We come earlier. We get earlier access” Taylor said. “We can get a lot of those things that we’re looking for.”

Taylor said her requests included funding for infrastructure and investments in education some narrower than the mayor’s.

“He’s advocating for some of the same things we are but remember it’s 50 other folks. It’s just 20 of us as the Black Caucus and so he’s advocating on the entire city. We have specific asks for the South and West sides” Taylor said.

“Him coming down is a great thing. Him coming down with us didn’t make or break us because now the other caucuses have to do their due diligence to come down here as well.”

During Johnson’s closed-door meetings the Illinois Senate Executive Committee quietly cleared an education measure that Johnson and the Chicago Teachers Union had opposed.

The bill was initially intended to stop the Chicago Board of Education from closing or making any changes to selective enrollment schools until 2027 when the board will be fully elected. It was a response to a resolution passed by the CPS board that called for a plan to invest in neighborhood schools and move away from school choice.

The measure the Senate committee passed Wednesday cleared the House last month. It included a moratorium on all Chicago school closings until 2027 — and it would also stop the Chicago Board of Education from changing standards of admission for selective enrollment schools. The measure must still clear the full Senate.

Johnson said he has had discussions with lawmakers to amend the measure: “Those amendments are being assessed and analyzed now.”

As for whether he felt snubbed by the Senate’s approval during his visit the mayor countered that he understood the “process.”

“There’s a process that the General Assembly goes through” Johnson said. “I understand that process and we’re going to stick to that process.”

Businesses are facing some significant financial storms because of the high inflation numbers plus the ominous cloud of COVID-19 continues to hover overhead.

Jason Alston owner of Heavens Table BBQ 5507 W North Avenue used various strategies to weather the storm to keep his business afloat.

At Heaven’s Table BBQ you can find a variety of menu items that includes a variety of smoked meats like brisket ribs pulled pork excellent pastrami and sausage along with wings sandwiches and sides.

“I want to start off and say COVID-19 was the first supposed disaster and the thing with business is you always have to be ready for adjustments. I learned back in culinary school when it comes to the restaurant industry even when it’s not inflation you still have prices that fluctuate up and down” said Alston.

Alston says that the restaurant business is a whole different animal.

Alston has a passion for cooking and has been cooking professionally for the last 13 years with education from MATC culinary to Cardinal Stritch to Marquette he was well trained and ready for the challenge.

Many businesses are also struggling with inflation. Raw materials and finished goods are more expensive and workers are demanding higher pay. Owners have been forced to raise prices or cut back on some services.

“I had to raise my prices a couple of times with my product and my customers were not too happy” Alston said. “I also have to accommodate them too so having to raise the prices I made my sides bigger you have to justify the price increase.”

“Every industry is impacted a little differently from inflation that’s a general blank statement but overall there’s rising costs of materials costs of goods inventory can be affected” said Jason Engledow Business Banking Area Manager JPMorgan Chase.

“I reached out to JP Morgan Chase for a PPP Loan when it was available. I also received a credit card. Chase offers a lot of help with conversation and would consistently ask what I needed help with” Alston said. “They’ve truly been helpful and they’re the first bank I worked with and actually haven’t had to look anywhere else for my business needs.”

JPMorgan Chase serves a variety of clients from restaurants to industrial to manufacturing to professional services.

Engledow offers tips that businesses can mitigate inflationary risks look at their excess cash flow and keep a reserve to weather the storm. Reach out to a financial advisor on how to manage their debt and how to manage vendor relationships. Focus on operations and the relationships they have with their employees and their customers.

JPMorgan Chase has been constantly investing in people and technology in the communities that they serve.

“One thing I’m so proud of is that sometime in 2023 we’re going to invest in a mentorship program” Engledow said. “We have peer to peer free consulting to educate on business plans coaching and tools.”

“We want to do everything we can from Chase’s standpoint to really focus on Black entrepreneurs and how critical a role that they play the economic role of the community. This is going to be a unique program we’ve launched in other cities and have had a lot of success. I’m very excited it’s coming to our market in Milwaukee sometime in 2023” Engledow said.

Remarkably some businesses have demonstrated the ability to wade through the pandemic and inflation. Businesses will have to remain attentive to keep their business afloat.

An important piece of advice from Alston “Don’t let the circumstances right now discourage you these things happen. Whatever your dreams and passions are keep following them.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vbnltYWcuY29tL2ludGVsbGlnZW5jZXIvMjAyMi8wOC90aGUtZHJhdy1vZi1tYXJ0aGFzLXZpbmV5YXJkLWZvci1ibGFjay1uZXcteW9yay1wb2xpdGljaWFucy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Draw of Martha's Vineyard for Black New York Politicians,"Oak Bluffs. Photo: Adam Glanzman/Bloomberg via Getty Images

The rising stars of New York’s Black political Establishment still growing accustomed to their power made the wise decision to put a trip to Martha’s Vineyard on the agenda this year. For nearly a century the annual summer gathering of Black upper-middle-class artists scholars lawyers doctors and executives has been a hub of cultural events academic panels and informal social bonding. In recent years it’s also been a good place for politicians to pick up campaign donations.

It’s a trip that requires some planning: It’s not always easy to get a ticket on the ferries that service the Vineyard and only a few daily direct flights from New York — and almost no available hotel rooms on the island in August (a recent search on Airbnb found weekend stays going for between $979 and $10000 a night).

So it’s a big deal that Mayor Eric Adams arrived on the island and stayed overnight to attend a fundraiser in Edgartown sponsored by DeNora and Mark Getachew. Attorney General Letitia James Assemblymembers Alicia Hyndman and Latrice Walker and activist Tamika Mallory showed up for quiet meetings. (“I listened and learned. I spoke and informed. I gave money and received support. I laughed so much with friends” Mallory posted on Instagram.)

The private fundraisers and informal meetings are a chance for the state’s leaders to network without pressure from needy constituents pushy lobbyists and nosy journalists.

“I’ve been trying to get [Assembly Speaker] Carl Heastie to come here for years. This is his first time” said Hasoni Pratts a political consultant with a home in Oak Bluffs who co-sponsored a fundraiser for Heastie and separate events for several other candidates. “This isn’t like the Latino political conference or the Black Caucus weekend. It’s a much more relaxed environment — not as stuffy and transactional as the usual events.”

Pratts also hosted Brooklyn’s own Representative Hakeem Jeffries a leading candidate in the race to become the next Speaker of the House in his first-ever Vineyard fundraiser. Jeffries was in town to headline California congresswoman Barbara Lee’s 17th Annual Martha’s Vineyard weekend which included Representative Gregory Meeks of Queens Joyce Beatty of Ohio Jahana Hayes of Connecticut Lisa Rochester of Delaware and Terri Sewell of Alabama.

The fascinating story of how and why generations of Black professionals have flocked to the Vineyard every August is chronicled in Our Kind of People by author-attorney Lawrence Otis Graham who died last year at age 59. Graham a graduate of Princeton and Harvard Law was an insightful analyst of race and class; he once took a break from his corporate-law job to work undercover as a busboy at an all-white country club in Greenwich mercilessly exposing its snobbery in a New York cover story.

Oak Bluffs on the north coast of the Vineyard has become a place where Black middle-class overachievers come to relax connect and network free from the tensions glass ceilings and subtle snubs of their mostly white workplaces and neighborhoods back home. This month members of Jack and Jill the invitation-only Black youth organization held mixers for teenagers — along with a session on SAT prep. Recruiters from Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase were on hand for low-key meet-and-greets with university students many of them from historically Black colleges. And hundreds of members of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority gathered at Inkwell Beach which they turned into the “Pinkwell” for a day.

The 2022 season started with a bang when ex-president Barack Obama and Michelle Obama — who own a 29-acre estate in Edgartown — made a surprise appearance at the 20th annual Martha’s Vineyard African-American Film Festival to introduce Descendant a documentary produced by the Obamas’ film company Higher Ground. The festival included Viola Davis broadcaster Tiffany Cross the Reverend Al Sharpton (the subject of a documentary) Tyler Perry and of course Spike Lee who owns a home in Oak Bluffs and has a forthcoming film about NFL ex-quarterback Colin Kaepernick.

In addition to the film festival Spike and Tonya Lewis Lee hosted a sold-out fundraiser for Wes Moore the former CEO of the Robin Hood Foundation who is the Democratic nominee for governor of Maryland.

I ran into my friend Patrick Gaspard the former White House political director for Obama who now runs the Center for American Progress think tank and was part of a panel in Oak Bluffs on Black women in the workplace that included Yamiche Alcindor the host of Washington Week on PBS. Political commentator Bakari Sellers moderated a panel on Black philanthropy; former Bronx assemblyman Michael Blake put together a conference on tech and politics; and the Council of Urban Professionals a civic and corporate networking organization convened its summit.

Representative Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas was in the Vineyard as was Deidre DeJear the Democratic nominee running for governor of Iowa. So was Representative Karen Bass the leading candidate for mayor of Los Angeles. There was buzz around Representative Ruben Gallego of Arizona and Representative Nikema Williams of Georgia both considered young up-and-comers likely to wield significant influence in Congress (Williams doubles as state chair of the Georgia Democratic Party).

“The reason why I open up my network is to help those who don’t have those connections or resources but they really want to do good — they really want to be good public servants and their values are in the right place but they just don’t have the network” says Pratts. “Running for office is hard and a lot of people don’t have the opportunity to do any type of self-care. But when they come here at least they get a few hours to do self-care even if it’s just sitting by the pool or going to the beach. So that’s also part of the donation.”

One big force at the center of the two-month equity rally is showing signs of fatigue.It’s the behavior of short sellers whose frantic efforts to unwind bearish wagers created buying that added fuel to the $7 trillion share advance. Evidence is arising now that the process is petering out.Hedge funds that make both bullish and bearish equity bets pretty much stopped purchasing shares to return to lenders this week after previously doing it at the fastest pace in more than two years data from JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s prime broker unit show.Meanwhile Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s hedge-fund clients boosted short positions Wednesday with bets against exchange-traded funds rising the most in more than two months.The shift makes sense from certain technical perspectives. The S&P 500 this week failed to surpass a key long-term trendline its 200-day average. A bunch of potentially bearish events are coming up from central bankers’ annual retreat in Jackson Hole Wyoming to the release of government data on consumer prices and employment.“Hedge funds may view the June-to-August rally as too far too fast and now are licking their chops for another round of downside” said Mike Bailey director of research at wealth management firm FBB Capital Partners. “Tactically markets look a bit feeble at the moment as investors price in good inflation and Fed news.”Since the market’s trough in June computer-driven traders such as trend followers that are mostly active in the futures market have snapped up about $100 billion of equities Morgan Stanley ’s trading unit estimated as many went short during the first-half rout and were caught off guard by the subsequent rebound.There are still a lot of bearish positions outstanding Morgan Stanley’s data show. In the cash market while $50 billion has been covered since June the net amount of added shorts remains elevated sitting at $165 billion this year. Short interest among single stocks stands in the 84th percentile of a one-year range.“The short base in US equities is still not cleaned up though” Morgan Stanley wrote in a note. “With short leverage still high there is more potential for hedge fund short covering.”For now however hedge funds are taking a breather. After spending the past month unwinding bearish trades at a pace last seen at the start of the pandemic bull market JPMorgan’s hedge-fund clients stopped covering this week.At Goldman hedge funds increased short sales while added longs on Wednesday leading to the biggest jump in gross trading activity since the market’s low in mid-June.

The news agency reported that the Royal Foundation also places more than half of its investments in a fund advertised as green that owns shares in large food companies that buy palm oil from companies linked to deforestation.

“The earth is at a tipping point and we face a stark choice” the prince a well-known environmentalist is quoted saying on the websites of the Earthshot Prize and Royal Foundation.

Yet in 2021 the charity kept more than 1.1 million pounds ($1.3 million) with JPMorgan Chase according to the most recent filings and still invests with the corporation today. The foundation also held 1.7 million pounds ($2 million) in a fund run by British firm Cazenove Capital Management according to the 2021 filing.

As with JPMorgan it still keeps funds with Cazenove which in May had securities linked to deforestation through their use of palm oil. The foundation invested similar amounts in both funds in 2020 its older filings show. As of December 2021 the charity also held more than 10 million pounds ($12.1 million) in cash.

The investments which the Royal Foundation didn’t dispute when contacted by AP come as top scientists repeatedly warn that the world must shift away from fossil fuels to sharply reduce emissions and avoid more and increasingly intense extreme weather events.

Financial experts say investments like those of the foundation can be blind spots for charities and philanthropies. As climate change is an increasing area of attention for foundations and others organizations have sometimes struggled to recognize where their own investments lie and align them with more environmentally friendly choices despite growing numbers of ways to steer clear of funds linked to fossil fuels.

Like the Royal Foundation in recent years other foundations including high profile British charities like the National Trust and Wellcome Trust also have faced criticism for investments with strong connections to fossil fuels or environmentally harmful practices. Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates announced that he divested his foundation’s direct oil and gas holdings in 2019."

""After a couple of changes in ownership it just made sense for us to reflect the current name by which the company has become recognised as one of Northumberland's largest and best-known employers"" explained PTFC club chairman Chris Watkins.

""We've been around for a number of years but after the appointment of a new management committee the club has been rejuvenated.

""And thanks to Essity paying us for naming rights we can progress our plans to make this a real community asset - half football half social.""

Essity Park is home to Prudhoe Youth Club Seniors Newcastle University Prudhoe Town Sunday and Prudhoe Town Women's FC.

Prudhoe Plodders also use the track for practice.

Essity site assistant Cath Frost added: ""Prudhoe Mill has been involved in the town's football club since the 1980s and although since then our business has been bought once and changed its name twice we have continued to be proud of our association with the club and its players.

""It's great to have been part of the team for so long - with a plague inside the clubhouse marking those historic links.

""Many of our employees have used the facilities over the years and with the club's new drive to get more social members I think we're going to be together for many more to come.""",,,,,,,,,

Oil stocks tend to be volatile due to uncertainties in the oil markets which often experience elongated periods of boom and bust. Losing faith in the viability of oil and gas as an energy source and selling stocks when the markets aren't favorable can prove to be a costly mistake. If you plan to invest in energy stocks you should have a long-term investment horizon.

Let's look at why keeping a long-term horizon is important and the top stocks you can buy and hold for the next decade and beyond.

Fluctuations in oil prices

Over the past two decades Brent crude oil prices fluctuated significantly -- from over $120 per barrel to below $40 per barrel. Domestic benchmark West Texas Intermediate also moved largely in tandem with the global prices.

Indeed profits that the integrated oil and gas companies such as ExxonMobil (XOM 1.97%) and Chevron (CVX 1.79%) make when oil prices are $120 per barrel are quite different from those made if prices fall below $40 per barrel. The performance of oil and gas stocks over the last 10-year period was not impressive largely due to low energy commodity prices.

As the chart shows top oil and gas stocks -- ExxonMobil Chevron Kinder Morgan (KMI 1.06%) Williams Companies (WMB 0.66%) and Enterprise Products Partners (EPD 0.84%) -- underperformed the S&P 500 Index over this period. Notably the chart starts in 2012 when oil and energy stock prices were very high. Still the recent rise in energy stock prices has boosted the returns on these stocks back into the green.

Let's move back a little to see how energy stocks have fared over the last two decades. Kinder Morgan is eliminated because it didn't go public until 2011.

Chevron Williams Companies and Enterprise Products Partners outperformed the S&P 500 Index in total returns over the last 20 years. If we go back further the top performers change again. Still most stocks outperformed the market.

Notably all five stocks outperformed the broader market in the last year.

The takeaway is that if you invest in strong well-managed energy companies with diversified assets and hold the stocks long term you'll generate handsome returns while diversifying your portfolio.

Top energy stocks

Chevron and ExxonMobil are among the largest integrated oil companies in the world. Both have been operating for decades generating handsome returns for their shareholders. Both Chevron and ExxonMobil are Dividend Aristocrats with Chevron raising its dividend for 35 years in a row and ExxonMobil for 39. Although some investors may prefer one over the other there are several things to like about both.

If you don't like integrated oil stocks' volatile earnings and prices you can consider companies operating in the midstream energy space. These companies are primarily involved in transporting and storing oil gas and natural gas liquids. Their earnings are relatively stable compared to oil and gas producers as they typically generate fee-based cash flow based on volumes transported or stored.

Enterprise Products Partners Kinder Morgan and Williams Companies are among the top midstream stocks to consider buying now. Regular dividend income contributed significantly to the handsome total returns these stocks generated over years as discussed above.

Enterprise Products Partners stock offers an attractive distribution yield of 6.9%. The company has been growing its dividend for 24 consecutive years and looks well placed to continue growing them in the years to come.

Kinder Morgan stock offers a dividend yield of 5.9%. The expected demand growth for natural gas offers visible growth opportunities for Kinder Morgan in the coming decades. At the same time the company is looking to expand its operations in the renewable energy space. Likewise Williams Companies is focused on high-return expansion projects and the stock offers an attractive yield of 4.9%. In all investing in these five energy stocks for the long term could significantly enhance your portfolio returns.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3RoZWNvbnZlcnNhdGlvbi5jb20vdGhlLWJpZy1mb3VyLW9pbHNhbmRzLWNvbXBhbmllcy1pbmZsdWVuY2UtdGhyZWF0ZW5zLWFsYmVydGEtZGVtb2NyYWN5LWFyZ3Vlcy1wb2xpdGljYWwtc2NpZW50aXN0LTE4ODU2N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Big Four oilsands companies' influence threatens Alberta democracy argues political scientist,"Over the past five years ownership of oilsands production has become hyperconcentrated in four companies: Cenovus Energy Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNRL) Imperial Oil Limited and Suncor Energy.

These four producers — known as the Big Four — account for about 84 per cent of Alberta’s daily production of 3.3 million barrels of bitumen a type of crude oil found in oilsands deposits.

Not only that but it is the oilsands that have driven Alberta’s economy and finances for the past two decades. According to Alberta’s 2022 budget oilsands production will make up 87 per cent of the province’s total oil production as conventional fields empty.

In the face of growing environmental concerns and regulatory requirements some international companies have decided to exit the oilsands. Between 2016 and 2019 foreign oil companies Chevron Shell BP and Statoil sold their oilsands holdings.

But other major Canadian producers like CNRL and Cenovus Energy have doubled down. They see the emission-intensive extraction operation as a golden opportunity to dominate an increasingly single-industry province.

As a political scientist who has worked in a large Alberta-based financial institution and the provincial treasury department I am familiar with the booms and busts of Alberta’s economy and its correlation to provincial finances. The financial dependence of the Alberta government on bitumen royalties has increased enormously over the past several years.

An industry flush with cash

By comparing the amount of bitumen royalties and corporate income taxes from the Big Four to Alberta’s total revenue it is possible to estimate the province’s fiscal dependency on these companies.

The numbers show that no province other than perhaps New Brunswick with its dominant Irving family comes near Alberta’s level of corporate fiscal dependency.

The revenue expected from the Big Four oilsands producers in 2022 assuming an average per barrel price of $115 will be a staggering $116 billion — about 25 per cent of Alberta’s GDP.

During the first half of 2022 Imperial Oil Cenovus Energy CNRL and Suncor Energy have reported net income of $17.1 billion.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jonathan Hayward

What is less understood is what this vast increase in revenue means for the Alberta treasury and to a lesser extent the federal government.

During the first six months of 2022 the Big Four paid an estimated $8 billion in royalties to the Alberta government. Most of their $6.8 billion in income tax expenses went to the federal government with the remaining 30 per cent going to the Alberta government.

Since Alberta has the lowest corporate tax rate in the country this creates an enormous incentive for these companies to create as much taxable income as possible. The taxes and royalties so far this year amount to about $10 billion which would easily pay for Alberta’s K-12 education system.

Lining the government’s pockets

The concentration of economic and financial power in the Big Four means Alberta’s next premier must heed the needs of these massive oilsands players. As oil prices rise the financial dependency of the provincial treasury on the Big Four will grow.

Alberta’s 2022 budget adopted a very conservative oil price estimate of US$70 per barrel which deliberately understated the expected surplus. It estimated bitumen royalties would return $10.3 billion during the fiscal year.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jeff McIntosh

For every dollar above this US$70 per barrel estimate an additional $500 million in oil royalties will flow to the government. At US$100 a barrel an additional $9 billion in bitumen royalties would be paid but with oil prices averaging US$116 since April 1 an additional $23 billion in oil and gas royalties could roll in.

Using this conservative oil price forecast Alberta’s budget estimated its total revenue will be $52 billion. In reality its revenue will likely be much higher.

The Big Four contribute about 20 per cent of Alberta’s total revenue. At US$100 per barrel the Big Four contribute about 30 per cent of the province’s revenue and at US$116 per barrel the contribution exceeds 30 per cent. This gives these companies an enormous amount of control over Alberta’s finances and by extension politics.

Pathways Alliance

The Big Four’s political influence has most recently manifested in its dominant position in the Pathways Alliance. This lobbying consortium — known as COSIA — consists of the Big Four ConocoPhillips and MEG Energy.

According to their website COSIA’s purpose is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from oilsands production and achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions. The Pathways Alliance sees oilsands production carrying on for nearly three decades and beyond.

Central to this lobby effort has been successfully convincing Ottawa to give the firms a tax credit in the 2022 federal budget. This sets a dangerous precedent — if Ottawa itself is willing to grant the wishes of the Big Four what chance will the Alberta premier have in refusing similar requests?

The fiscally dependent Alberta government will continue its battles against Ottawa on behalf of the Big Four. Whether or not this is good for Alberta’s democracy its residents and the planet is another matter entirely.",,,,,,,,,

However no Irish dairy processor made the grade.

The 11 European food companies on the list were complimented by two each from China the US and Canada and one from New Zealand India and Japan respectively.

France has two companies in the top three with Lactalis leading the way on a turnover of $26.7bn while Danone was ranked third with a turnover of $21bn. The French duo was split by Nestlé with the Swiss firm’s turnover put at $21.3bn.

The top five was completed by Dairy Farmers of America and Chinese company Yilli. These concerns had turnovers of $19.3bn and $18.2bn respectively.

Rest of the top 10

The remainder of the top 10 was made up by Fonterra (New Zealand) Mengniu (China) Friesland-Campina (Netherlands) Arla Foods (Denmark-Sweden) and Saputo (Canada). The turnovers for these dairy processors ranged from $12bn to $14.8bn.

The firms listed from positions 11 to 15 were Unilever (Netherlands-UK) Savencia (France) Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd (India) Sodiaal (France) and Meiji (Japan). The turnovers for these dairy concerns went from $5.9bn to $8.3bn.

The final five on the list included Agropur (Canada) Muller (Germany) DMK (Germany) Schreiber Foods (US) and Froneri (UK). The turnovers varied from $5bn to $5.8bn.

Calculations

The turnover calculations were based on 2021 financial results as well as mergers and acquisitions in the first six months of 2022.

The Rabobank survey found that the combined turnover of the companies included in the global dairy top 20 grew by 9.3% in dollar terms compared with last year and by 5% in euro terms.

The top performers in terms of turnover growth compared with the 2021 list were Lactalis and Yilli.

Lactalis which is privately owned grew its turnover by $4bn on the back of the acquisition of Kraft Heinz’s natural cheese business in the US. This was followed by a raft of acquisitions in Europe and Australia.

Although Chinese firm Yilli remained in fifth place on the list the company grew its turnover by $3bn. This was driven by stronger domestic sales in China and the purchase of IMF-producer Ausnutria.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In the nine-second clip user Drake Pooley (@drakepooley) reveals the outside of a Kroger as he heads inside. He then records himself entering his old landline number to build its Kroger rewards points.

While Pooley’s landline is no longer in use the number now presumably belongs to another person. However he’s not giving up on his family’s stockpile of rewards points.

“To whoever now has the phone number from my family’s landline in the mid-2000s sorry but you’re going to have to pry our KrogerPlus Rewards account from my cold dead hands” the TikToker says in a voice-over.

Pooley added in the caption “we didn’t work so hard for two decades to just give up now.”

The video has been viewed over 842000 times since it was posted on Aug. 2. Several viewers similarly shared how they continue to use their own—or other’s—old landline numbers to rack up rewards points.

“My best friend uses my old house phone Kroger account” one user wrote.

“i still use my ex’s parents’ home number. i dated him like 20 yrs ago” a second said.

“Yes! My parents haven’t had their landline in line 10 yrs but we all still use the same Kroger card with that ph# lol” a third stated.

Many commenters argued that a shared rewards account usually allows all members to reap the benefits.

“My gramma doesn’t drive I use her fuel points every time! She racks them up!” one user commented.

“I live in Dallas now and have been sharing my CVS reward card with a Vietnamese woman from NYC since 2007. Neither of us will let go” a second shared.

“Whoever has ours now consistently allows me to get the cheapest gas because of the fuel points” a third said.

The Daily Dot reached out to Drake Pooley for comment via TikTok comment and Kroger via email.

Breathitt County dominated on the field as well as the stat sheet on Friday night. The Bobcats rolled up 402-total yards compared to 137 for the visiting Hornets. The Bobcat offensive line took the game over midway through the second quarter and paved the way for 227-rushing yards. The home team jumped out to a 36-0 advantage at halftime. Quarterback Tyler Bryant finished the contest 10/14 for 175-yards. Receiver Blake Ritchie led the way with four receptions for 93-yards.

Magoffin County running back Ben Lafferty led the visitors with 68-yards off 17 carries. He was joined by quarterback Aden Barnett in the Hornet offensive attack. The duo put up the majority of offensive production for the game.

The crowd was cheering and smiling. Given the tragic stories following the July flood that was the best part of the night. The county came together for a high school football game. It was a beautiful site.

Kroger is a staple in your hometown community just like high school football. There’s nothing quite like Friday nights in the Bluegrass. We are honored to share this journey with Kroger and you for the third consecutive season. We hope you enjoyed this Kroger KSR Game of the Week and look forward to more stops in communities around the Commonwealth.

JULIET Tenn. (WTVF) — Saturday shoppers at the Kroger in Providence Marketplace in Mt. Juliet showed their appreciation to our local service members.

Kroger and USO Fort Campbell teamed up for a ""fill the truck"" event to collect snacks for military service members and their families.

Despite the rain volunteers helped collect donations from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.

Organizers said that while it's a small action it truly goes a long way.

""I like giving back. This is such an easy way to do it. It's rewarding"" said Ann Jarvis executive director of USO Fort Campbell and Nashville. ""The military does so much for us and this is just a great way to say thank you. And it's an easy and simple way to say thank you.""

In total there were more than 600 food items collected.

The next ""fill the truck"" event will be in Clarksville on September 17 at the Gordon Food Service store."

The U.S. Air Force released new photos of the new EC-37B Compass Call as it briefly visited Davis-Monthan Air Force Base on August 17 2022. The visit gave to the personnel of the 55th Electronic Combat Group the opportunity to see up-close the aircraft that will replace in a few years their ageing EC-130Hs giving in turn better performance and new capabilities over the retiring aircraft. The aircraft which received all external modification is still flying with its primer paint and the civilian registration N591GA.

As you may know already the Compass Call system is an airborne tactical electronic attack weapon system installed on a heavily modified version of the C-130 Hercules called EC-130H Compass Call. This system disrupts enemy command and control communications radars and navigation systems and limits adversary coordination which is essential for enemy force management.

The EC-130H flew for the first time in 1981 and was delivered to the Air Force a year later. The Compass Call is one of the busiest assets of the entire US inventory which took part in every conflict where US troops were engaged in combat and is also longest continuously deployed Air Force asset being deployed since 2002 in Afghanistan. After 40 years however the EC-130H is in need of a replacement with five aircraft out of 14 already retired.

Following the type’s retirement announced in 2014 the U.S. Air Force initiated the Compass Call Rehost program which will move the current Compass Call systems from the EC-130H to the new EC-37B based on the Gulfstream G550 Conformal Airborne Early Warning Aircraft (CAEW) airframe. As for the EC-130H BAE Systems is the contractor for the Prime Mission Equipment (PME) and L3 Communications is the contractor for aircraft integration and depot maintenance.

The selection of the G550 was the conclusion of a series of assessments that led the Air Force to choose to rehost the existing Compass Call mission system onto a commercial derivative aircraft resulting in a sole-source contract to L3 Communications and Gulfstream in 2017. The G550 has increased speed endurance and extended stand-off range over the legacy EC-130H aircraft says L3Harris providing significantly improved survivability as well as providing improved stand-off jamming capability and flexibility to counter sophisticated communications and radar threats.

Ten EC-37Bs the first three of which are currently being modified in Savannah Georgia and Waco Texas are scheduled to replace the entire EC-130H fleet. It seems however that the order might be increased to 14 aircraft replacing the EC-130H in a 1-to-1 ratio. The first flight of the new EC-37B took place on October 7 2021 while the first ground test of the fully modified aircraft equipped with the Compass Call system are planned for 2023. Air Combat Command plans to field the first five EC-37Bs in 2023.

These first five EC-37B aircraft will host the current Baseline 3 variant of Compass Call which will be “transplanted” from the retired EC-130Hs. The remaining aircraft are scheduled to receive the upgraded Baseline 4 variant currently in development which will reportedly introduce a new low-band jammer system.

One of the technologies that should make it into the Baseline 4 system is the Small Adaptive Bank of Electronic Resources (SABER) technology by BAE Systems which was successfully flight tested for the first time last year. According to the statement from BAE Systems SABER is a major technological advance that will allow the Compass Call weapon system to transition from hardware to software-based electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) warfare capability.

The SABER system is built on a suite of Software Defined Radios (SDRs) using an open system architecture and will provide the backbone of the new EC-37B’s operating system. This way the Compass Call can be updated without significant physical reconfiguration and enable the U.S. Air Force to rapidly and proactively respond to emerging enemy threat systems.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vaW52ZXN0b3JwbGFjZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC83LWRlZmVuc2Utc3RvY2tzLXdpdGgtZGl2aWRlbmRzLXlvdS1jYW4tY291bnQtb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7 Defense Stocks With Dividends You Can Count On,,,,,,,,,,

The new Neurofilament Light Chain (NfL) blood test will allow doctors to identify and verify signs of neurodegenerative disease enabling physicians to provide a more effective and efficient path to diagnosis and treatment for patients.

Elevated NfL levels signal neuronal injury whether from diseases like multiple sclerosis Alzheimer's and Parkinson's or from brain injury such as with concussion.

""NfL is a simple objective blood test that provides direct evidence of neuronal damage"" said Dr. Brian Caveney chief medical officer and President Labcorp Diagnostics. ""In making this test widely available Labcorp is supporting neurologists with a tool they've been asking for that enables faster diagnoses better treatment decisions and improved patient care. It's a major step forward in the monitoring and identification of patients with neuronal injury due to disease or trauma.""

Neurological disease presents in many forms and today confirmation of disease is often complex and challenging. When neurons are damaged proteins called neurofilaments are released and are detectable in blood. One of three main neurofilament types NfL has been the most widely studied in research settings but a reliable NfL test has not been widely available for patient care.

Broad availability to physicians as part of their diagnostic toolbox is expected to provide significant benefits in supporting more effective diagnosis and treatment of many disorders.

""Importantly NfL isn't specific to one disease but it is highly specific to neuronal damage from a wide variety of causes from Alzheimer's and multiple sclerosis to concussion and physical injury. This test will be impactful in helping many patients"" said Dr. Joseph Volpe neurology business segment and discipline director at Labcorp. ""Serial use of NfL testing can help doctors to follow trends that indicate the effectiveness of medicines or therapies or whether there is continued injury or disease progression.""

The new NfL test is performed from a standard blood collection that can be done at a hospital physician's office or at any of Labcorp's nearly 2000 patient service centers. Launch and availability of the test demonstrates Labcorp's commitment to neurology and to improving the health and lives of the millions afflicted by neurodegenerative and related diseases.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Consumer behavior is incredibly complex and nuanced.

Over the past year we’ve learned that consumer spending can rise even as consumer sentiment plummets amid high inflation and the rising risk of a recession.

One category that’s seen a particularly high level of inflation is travel with airline fares up 28% from a year ago. Yet one of the strongest areas of consumer spending has been vacation travel which by the way is considered a discretionary expense.

On the matter of discretionary spending Bank of America analysts recently found ”consumers do not necessarily dine out less during downturns but rather they tend to shift to cheaper restaurants.”

That brings us to one of my favorite quotes from the recent earnings season.

It comes from Lamb Weston LW 0.11%↑  the $11 billion potato processor that supplies frozen french fries to your favorite restaurants including McDonald’s. During the company’s July 27 quarterly earnings call CEO Tom Werner called attention to the “fry attachment rate” (via The Motley Fool):

Despite pressure on overall restaurant traffic the demand for fries remain solid as the fry attachment rate in the U.S. which is a rate in which consumers order fries when visiting a restaurant or other food service outlets remains above pre-pandemic levels.

In other words when people go out to eat they’re not allowing their deteriorating sentiment toward the economy affect their decision to order a side of fries.

Here’s a little more color from CFO Bernadette Madarieta:

Overall we expect U.S. demand to remain solid but will also likely be affected by significant inflation that consumers are facing. In the event of an economic recession we expect demand for French fries will be resilient although with little to no growth. That's consistent with what we experienced during the great recession from 2008 to 2010.

While the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression might’ve stalled growth it wasn’t enough to get people to stop ordering fries.

Fascinating stuff.

In case you missed it

🙋🏻‍♂️ Many of you became new subscribers in recent months. (Welcome!) Some of you haven’t had the time to open all of the newsletters. (We’re all busy!) Some of you are free subscribers looking for a reason to become a paid subscriber.

For all y’all here’s a roundup of some of TKer’s most talked-about paid and free newsletters. All of the headlines are hyperlinked to the archived pieces.

Passive investing is a concept usually associated with buying and holding a fund that tracks an index. And no passive investment strategy has attracted as much attention as buying an S&P 500 index fund. However the S&P 500 — an index of 500 of the largest U.S. companies — is anything but a static set of 500 stocks. From January 1995 through April 2022 728 tickers have been added to the S&P 500 while 724 have been removed.

Story continues

S&P Dow Jones Indices found that funds beat their benchmark in a given year are rarely able to continue outperforming in subsequent years. According to their research 29% of 791 large-cap equity funds beat the S&P 500 in 2019. Of those funds 75% beat the benchmark again in 2020. But only 9.1% or 21 funds were able to extend that outperformance streak into 2021.

Investors should always be mentally prepared for some big sell-offs in the stock market. It’s part of the deal when you invest in an asset class that is sensitive to the constant flow of good and bad news. Since 1950 the S&P has seen an average annual max drawdown (i.e. the biggest intra-year sell-off) of 14%.

“While valuations feature importantly in our toolbox to estimate forward equity returns we should dispel an oft-repeated myth that equity valuations are mean-reverting” Goldman Sachs analysts argued. “…there is only 26% confidence that the Shiller CAPE is mean-reverting and 74% confidence that it is not.”

Media outlets sometimes unfairly characterize a new piece of data as they attempt to draw attention from their audiences. The November 2021 jobs report came with a lot of mainstream news headlines suggesting that the creation of 210000 jobs was a bad thing. Nine months later we’re learning that the labor market boom continues without interruption.

Picking stocks in an attempt to beat market averages is an incredibly challenging and sometimes money-losing effort. In fact most professional stock pickers aren’t able to do this on a consistent basis. One of the reasons for this is that most stocks don’t deliver above-average returns. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices only 22% of the stocks in the S&P 500 outperformed the index itself from 2000 to 2020. Over that measurement period the S&P 500 gained 322% while the median stock rose by just 63%.

After reporting disappointing quarterly results in February Meta shares plunged 26% in a single trading day. After losing an eye-popping $251 billion of market cap the social networking company quickly went from being the sixth largest company in the S&P 500 to the seventh. It’s the kind of move that could’ve rattled the confidence of investors and traders with positions in other stocks. And it did: That same day the S&P 500 fell 2.4%. But losing 2.4% isn’t remotely close to losing 26%. That’s diversification at work.

Published on Dec. 5 this newsletter showed Wall Street strategists were anticipating the S&P 500 to end 2022 somewhere between 4400 to 5300. The market is currently trading below the most bearish strategist’s target. Who knows? Maybe the market will surge during the final months of this year. That said I think this excerpt from that newsletter was noteworthy:

⚠️ It’s incredibly difficult to predict with any accuracy where the stock market will be in a year. In addition to the countless number of variables to consider there are also the totally unpredictable developments that occur along the way.Strategists will often revise their targets as new information comes in. In fact some of the numbers you see above represent revisions from prior forecasts.For most of y’all it’s probably ill-advised to overhaul your entire investment strategy based on a one-year stock market forecast.Nevertheless it can be fun to follow these targets. It helps you get a sense of the various Wall Street firm’s level of bullishness or bearishness.

Five stocks (Facebook Apple Amazon Microsoft and Google) account for a massive share of the market capitalization of the S&P 500 which consists of 500 companies. While it may be technically accurate to say these five stocks represent five companies it’s also a gross oversimplification of the businesses and markets these companies are exposed to.

Peter Lynch the legendary stock picker who ran Fidelity’s market-beating Magellan Fund for 13 years made a prescient observation in a speech he gave to the National Press Club back in October 7 1994: “Some event will come out of left field and the market will go down or the market will go up. Volatility will occur. Markets will continue to have these ups and downs. … Basic corporate profits have grown about 8% a year historically. So corporate profits double about every nine years. The stock market ought to double about every nine years … Because profits go up 8% a year and stocks will follow. That's all there is to it.“

The stock market can be an intimidating place: it’s real money on the line there’s an overwhelming amount of information and people have lost fortunes in it very quickly. But it’s also a place where thoughtful investors have long accumulated a lot of wealth. The primary difference between those two outlooks is related to misconceptions about the stock market that can lead people to make poor investment decisions.

Sign up now to receive EE Times Weekend. SUBSCRIBE The Sky’s the Limit Christine Evans-Pughe The first time I went to Las Vegas nearly 20 years ago I was baffled and bowled over in equal measure. Why were elderly people wheeling drip stands around? Why couldn’t I find an everyday bookshop? What genius had painted the ceiling of the Venetian hotel? Surely this was the most fabulous example of trompe l’oeil indoor sky ever — certainly in terms of sheer scale. Installed above the Venetian’s indoor canals street scenes and remodeled St. Mark’s Square the 105000-square-foot (that’s about 35 full-sized tennis courts) trompe l’oeil blue-sky ceiling is both beautiful and a bit bonkers. Imagine Canaletto meets Michelangelo with a nod to Edward Hopper. For me the Renaissance-style realism and artificial daylight brought on a dream-like discombobulated state as though trapped inside a movie. For some historical perspective Michelangelo and his assistants started painting the 12000 square feet of ceiling and walls (four full-sized tennis courts) of the Sistine Chapel in Rome in 1508. They didn’t finish it until 1512. That’s a long time to spend perched on 60-foot–high scaffolding applying paint to wet plaster. They had trickier things to paint than sky (nine scenes from the Book of Genesis of which The Creation of Adam is the best known). In contrast it took just two years to build the entire Venetian hotel before it opened in May 1999 with the help of a flock of white doves and some singing gondoliers. A company called Sky Art created the trompe l’oeil ceiling in 1998 with a little help from technology. Sky Art’s painters worked from aerial boom lifts from which they applied 250 gallons of water-based acrylic paint with spray guns. Sky Art CEO and former Hollywood scenery artist Karen Kristin stood at ground level and used a laser pointer to direct her team of assistants. Las Vegas hotels are in many ways ephemera with a limited shelf life. The Venetian was built on the site of the famous Sands Hotel where Frank Sinatra made his performing debut in 1953. The Sands met its end in 1996. According to a report in the Las Vegas Sun “After a countdown from 10 there were seven dynamite blasts and the 44-year–old 17-story tower collapsed into a 30-foot–high pile of rubble. The whole thing took 10 seconds.” Many people watched the hotel’s demise including a group of University of Las Vegas film students who videotaped it for a school project. “It was cool” one of them said. “Anything blowing up is cool.” It was the second demolition of a Las Vegas hotel-casino that the group had filmed. The first was the Dunes hotel-casino demolished in 1994 and they’d hoped to capture the Landmark in 1995 but missed it. This is how Las Vegas hotels meet their end. It would be sad to see The Venetian and its splendid ceiling go the same way. Let’s hope it has at least 20 more years to go.

Free Download A Glistening Jewel Alan Patterson Las Vegas. When the desert sand turns a deep purple in the twilight you become a glistening gem in the darkness. You are a neon oasis where people go for a brief time to have fun roll the dice and be naughty. You fulfill the urge of electronics journalists to write stories. You are a place where great fortunes are made and lost though generally not on the gambling table. One notable example is Sheldon Adelson who at his peak had a net worth of about $33 billion and became one of the world’s richest people. In the late 1970s Adelson and his partners launched the COMDEX (pardon the screaming ALL CAPS) trade show in Las Vegas for the computer industry one of the largest-such events in the world for decades. It was a gamble that paid off in spades for Adelson before he bailed out. In 1995 Adelson and his partners sold the Interface Group Show Division including COMDEX to Japan’s SoftBank for $862 million. It was a bet that Softbank founder Masayoshi Son probably regrets. Adelson made more than $500 million from the deal. Adelson had this knack for leaping from strength to strength. In the late 1980s he bought the Sands Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas for $110 million. From there he and his partners built the Sands Expo and Convention Center the first privately owned-and-operated convention center in the U.S. In the meantime COMDEX became a global event opening its doors to the general public and becoming a bit of a zoo. The first show outside the U.S. took place in Amsterdam in 1982. By 2000 annual exhibitions spread around the world to Europe Asia Africa and Australia. By 2004 as the personal computer waned in popularity the last COMDEX in Las Vegas was canceled and the Consumer Electronics Show rose to the occasion meeting new demand for a show that focused on increasingly popular gadgets like games and smartphones. In the same year Adelson took Las Vegas Sands casinos to Macau which would eventually eclipse Las Vegas as the world’s gambling mecca. Following the opening in Macau Adelson’s personal wealth multiplied more than 14×. Today the twinkle is returning to Las Vegas. Covid lockdowns in China have led to a plunge in Macau’s business. It all goes to show that fortunes change. My advice is not to gamble. The house always wins. Las Vegas you’ve had a good run. Beneath the Surface Sally Ward-Foxton Buckle up for your ride approximately 40 feet below the Las Vegas Strip in a futuristic battery-powered vehicle through purpose-built 13-foot tunnels. Like some other Las Vegas attractions the Boring Company’s LVCC Loop must be seen to be believed. The tunnel is even illuminated with color-changing disco lighting as you pass through. But scratch beneath the surface and you’ll realize the 1.7-mile ride is effectively just a taxi ride Vegas style. The LVCC Loop can handle 44000 passengers per hour and has three stops (two surface one subsurface) where drivers can drop off in specially built stations. It uses a fleet of 62 Tesla Model X and Model 3 electric vehicles with human drivers — just like a regular fleet of taxis using road tunnels except there are only three possible destinations. Consider it a proof of concept for a future Vegas-wide underground transit system — specifically a more ambitious 51-station tunnel system planned for the coming years. The plan includes a 29-mile loop with stops at Las Vegas’s airport stadium and university as well as many resorts. According to the Boring Company Tesla taxis in this system will drive straight to dropoff points making it much faster than a traditional underground train which would stop at every calling point along the way. Stations can be built as small as two parking spaces and it’s planned for Teslas in this system to drive at up to 150 mph (don’t get excited just yet — taxis in the current LVCC Loop run at much more terrestrial speeds). The real technology breakthrough here is the Boring Company’s drilling machine which dug the existing LVCC Loop in a year. Boring’s next-gen machines are 6× faster currently capable of a mile of tunnel a week. They are launched from the surface so no need to dig a huge pit to start with and they emerge mole-like into the surface sunshine at the other end ready for a station to be built next to the hole. The company hopes these machines will make tunnel construction economical and scalable for future transit systems. Without a Trace Sally Ward-Foxton Kaboom! As the Riviera one of Las Vegas’s oldest casinos is demolished — removed from the desert city without a trace. Or is it? The Riviera’s iconic red neon sign featured in a multitude of movies over the years has been taken to the Las Vegas Neon Museum and installed in the museum’s boneyard — a graveyard of vintage old and abandoned neon signage the majority in iconic mid-century design — as a tribute to Las Vegas’s history. Signs from forgotten casino complexes rest alongside signs from motels dry cleaners and wedding chapels. Neon signs first appeared in the 1920s but by the 1950s casino owners wanted to outdo each other with bigger brighter signs. The spirit of always going one bigger and one better lives on with casinos on prime real estate turned over relatively quickly. Old casino signs from properties like the Silver Slipper and Golden Nugget have been preserved by the Neon Museum to prevent every trace of these parts of Las Vegas’s culture being consigned to history completely. Famous animated cowboy Vegas Vic (constructed in 1951) can still be seen waving atop a Vegas souvenir shop. Cowgirl Vegas Vickie (1980) was removed in 2017 when her casino was demolished — she was restored being reinstalled at the Circa in 2020. Over the years some signs didn’t make it — the Mint the Dunes the Sands and more. But the Neon Museum has hundreds in its boneyard with 19 (including the Riviera’s) currently in working order. More are planned for restoration. In the meantime the boneyard is a riot of color even without illumination. One tip: Don’t go on a summer afternoon. The boneyard is outdoors.

SUBSCRIBE Ronald Glibbery: ‘Spend a Few Years Refining Your Skills as a Technologist’ Ronald Glibbery has served as CEO of Peraso Technologies the 5G/mmWave chip company he co-founded since December 2021. Prior to co-founding Peraso he held executive positions at Kleer Semiconductor a fabless semiconductor company focused on wireless audio technology and Intellon a pioneer and leader in the development of semiconductor devices used for powerline communications. He has held other executive roles at Cogency Semiconductor LSI Logic Canada Inc. and LSI Logic Corporation. Glibbery earned his B.E.Sc. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from the University of Western Ontario. What personal projects will you be working on this weekend Ron? While work and family keep me busy my spare time is usually spent on athletic activities such as squash tennis golf and skiing. The closest I come to technology projects outside of the office is on audio. I’m passionate about continuously improving sound quality and I’ve come to realize a sound system can be very simple or very complex. But the signal chain of a medium-quality system can be daunting including the vast variety of source material especially now with uncompressed streaming services DACs cabling amplifiers line conditioners room damping and of course speakers. It can all be very time-consuming and certainly expensive but the payoff is spine-tingling sound. What was your first job in the industry? My first job in the industry was designing graphics ICs for the U.S. Air Force. I worked for a company called Lytton Systems and it was an amazing job. Basically we were to produce the highest-performance graphics devices possible. This was pre-ATI/Nvidia days so there was still an opportunity to add significant value in this space. What made the job even more incredible was that it provided broad exposure to several technical concepts not the least of which was semiconductor IC design. But there were so many other important concepts involved such as high-speed memory architectures parallel processing multiply-accumulate functions for polygon processing assembly code optimization for algorithm optimization and so on. We used to go to the annual Siggraph conferences so we really witnessed the dawning of the 3D rendering age. I eventually moved to a more commercial role but as I mentioned above having solid technical experience in my opinion is a very important cornerstone in one’s career. What book do you read over and over again? My favorite book is “The Making of the Atomic Bomb” by Richard Rhodes. It a deeply comprehensive account of atomic physics from about the turn of the 20th century to the massive effort by the U.S. government to develop an atom bomb with the launch of Project Manhattan. The book is pretty technical but also explores the associated politics of the day as well as significant operational effort by the U.S. government to make it happen. It’s really fascinating! Of course those early atomic efforts led to the development of the transistor as well so that has a particular resonance for me as the CEO of a semiconductor company. What has been the highlight of your career to date? I’ve had many highlights but the most recent one was the completion of our RTO with MoSys last December and joining NASDAQ. After 14 years as a private company being public is a whole new experience. The liquidity of being a public company brings a host of benefits including employee recruitment and retention credibility with a larger customer base and access to capital if necessary. Obviously there’s the grind of the quarter-to-quarter earnings calls but frankly this brings a level of discipline to management that I believe is healthy. There is a prevailing concept that quarter-to-quarter objectives destroy long-term thinking but I don’t necessarily agree; I don’t believe these two concepts are mutually exclusive. In fact while our quarterly earnings are vital our investors demand a long-term vision for growth especially in the small and microcap world in which we reside today. What advice would you give to early-career engineers? The first piece of advice I would give is to make sure you spend two to four years refining your skills as a technologist. In my case I spent the first four years of my career designing graphic ICs. I learned so much about designing computer chips and it is still applicable in my current role as the CEO of a semiconductor company. I personally chose to pivot to a more commercial role but it’s clear to me that moving to a commercial track and sticking with a technical track are equally rewarding. I think each person needs to determine their own long-term goals and interests.

Johnny Friday and Rob Mader are musicians. They are not doctors. But Mader a sax virtuoso told Friday a few weeks ago “Music saved your life.”

Friday’s doctor told him the same thing.

“Music saved my life. How about that?” Friday says. “They were right.”

Friday is the thunderous drummer and horsepower behind Santa Fe & The Fat City Horns. He originally joined the band about 30 years ago then took off to perform around the world. He returned to full-time duty with the acclaimed 16-piece band about six years ago.

Well-known and highly regarded on the Las Vegas music scene the 60-year-old musician has been a coveted touring musician backing Natalie Cole Arturo Sandoval and Chick Corea among many international artists. Friday also lived in L.A. for about 25 years and performed in the house band for the Emmy Awards show People’s Choice Awards “American Idol” “The Chevy Chase Show” and Bonnie Hunt’s daytime talk show. He’s the drummer for the music in Clint Eastwood’s movies “The Mule” and “Jewel” and several TV commercials.

Even with that impressive resume Friday stays in the background. He’s noticed only when you hear his slamming beat akin to a pack of M-80s exploding onstage. But Friday’s consistency belied what doctors call a serious medical “episode” the night of June 13.

Friday had just returned from tour swing with Filipino star and Vegas favorite Martin Nievera scrambling to the show in the same clothes he’d worn on the plane because his luggage had been lost.

Typical night in showbiz in other words.

About four songs into the opening set Friday says “All of a sudden I felt like an elephant was standing on my chest.”

That seems the default description for anyone suffering a serious heart attack especially drummers. Pepe Jimenez used it when he suffered a similar onstage incident last year while rehearsing with David Perrico and the Raiders House Band at Allegiant Stadium. In a wild artistic and medical coincidence Jimenez was Santa Fe’s drummer until Friday returned to the band in full-time in 2017.

Friday knew something was wrong as he struggled to breathe while front man Jerry Lopez spoke to the crowd after the opening songs. “I literally was (makes heavy wheezing sound) trying to catch some air. But Jerry talked long enough for me to calm myself down” Friday says. “And I was drinking a bunch of water pacing myself playing 100 percent instead of 1000 percent.”

Friday had finished playing the band’s Earth Wind & Fire medley followed by the Santa Fe originals “The Answer” and “Dat Greazy Thang” a challenging stretch for even a healthy drummer.

Friday finished the show then packed his equipment and drove himself to Henderson Hospital’s emergency room. In another piece of unfortunate timing Friday’s wife Mary was on a cruise with a girlfriend she’d planned in 2019 and had been postponed three times because of COVID-19. She was in fact trapped on a ship at sea.

But it was Mary’s health insurance through Grainger commercial and industrial equipment supply company that has almost totally offset the couple’s $250000 (and climbing) medical bills.

“Later afterward when everyone learned what happened they thought I was crazy for finishing the gig” Friday says. “But the doctor told me ‘You saved your own life.’ And I’m like ‘Doc what are you talking about?’”

The drummer’s characteristically aerobic playing style kept the beat for the band and for Friday.

“So the doctor goes ‘The type of heart attack you had most people are sitting on the couch watching TV’ and if I had been doing that I would have been a done deal” Friday says. “The fact that I was exerting myself keeping my heart pumping kept the blood flowing and actually saved my life.”

Friday’s test results were at once disquieting and predictable for anyone who had this elephant-chest sensation. He would undergo open-heart quadruple-bypass surgery on June 16 three days after the show. He spent about two weeks in the hospital and several more in physical therapy gradually working his way back to the stage.

Friday’s first performance back for any show was the Aug. 6 Daniel Emmet-Pia Toscano performance at Westgate’s International Theater (the night David Foster popped into the show unbilled).

Friday then returned to Santa Fe’s show at the Copa Room at Bootlegger Bistro last Monday about two months to the day of the surgery.

“I kind of worked up my stamina up to play with Santa Fe” Friday says. “If I had tried to go from my couch directly to Santa Fe I would be back in the hospital.”

Friday and Jimenez bonded over their shared medical conditions.

“Pepe called me afterwards and gave me a heads up how you — how I’m — gonna feel how the physical therapy is going to go and this and that” Friday says. “So I tease him now because he only had a triple bypass. I tell him ‘You’re not a man until you have a quadruple bypass!’ But you know he’s been such a sweetheart through all of this and we have that shared history in Santa Fe.”

The message from Jimenez and now Friday is to simply pay attention to your health. Visit the doctor. Take medical advice and directives seriously. Friday has never experienced high blood pressure he doesn’t drink or smoke. He doesn’t even eat red meat.

“When something like this happens it puts a fine point on it” Friday says. “I’m fine I’m getting better every day. It’s a slow process you can’t rush it. But I’ll tell you I’m listening to my body and I’m taking nothing for granted.”

Estos textos de opinión han de basarse en datos verificados y ser respetuosos con las personas aunque se critiquen sus actos. Todas las columnas de opinión de personas ajenas a la Redacción de EL PAÍS llevarán tras la última línea un pie de autor —por conocido que éste sea— donde se indique el cargo título militancia política (en su caso) u ocupación principal o la que esté o estuvo relacionada con el tema abordado

Remember. Nos conocimos en Monterrey y lo primero que me enseñaste es la correcta pronunciación de tu nombre: Salmán (con acento en la segunda vocal) y Rúshdi (acentuando el sonido de la ú a contrapelo de los españoles que te llaman Ráshdi creyéndose británicos o los mexicanos que subrayan el Rósh como sinónimo gringo de avalancha o prisa). Salman Rushdie conocido por millones leído por no tantos incluido el fanático que te apuñaló hace apenas una semana; es decir hace un instante.

Al paso de las horas desde el atentado aumenta la enigmática ironía de que el asaltante –ahora preso—lleva en el apellido su sino. Se llama Matar y para su mayor desgracia ni eso logró; tal como se cumple un año más desde el asesinato del poeta García Lorca en Granada y los verdugos que tienen las calaveras rellenas de plomo queriendo matarlo tan sólo lograron quitarle la vida para volverlo inmortal. Retruécanos de la ironía enigma del tiempo y del desconocido guionista celestial que redacta que el nombre de verdugo se llame Matar o que Osama murió en tiempos de Obama y demás sincronicidades o rimas inexplicables.

Remember que me evocaste con sana nostalgia un paseo por La Alhambra de Granada del brazo de Antonio Muñoz Molina y que ambos aparecen en una fotografía que sirvió de dominical de El País donde se les ve rodeados de 12 o 14 transeúntes turistas o comparsas anónimos cuyas caras quedaron diluidas porque se trataban de escoltas incógnitos. Sólo caras desenfocadas en torno a dos rostros de escritores y el último suspiro del Moro se volvía tinta en papel sin que ustedes mismos supieran quiénes eran los arcángeles armados que los custodiaban por los azulejos de un palacio soñado decorado con versos del Corán… y el agua oculta que llora de sus fuentes.

Como parpadeo pasaron las décadas al grado de hacernos pensar que Salman ya podía andar sin escudos por el mundo y en Monterrey así como hace una semana apenas hubo vigilancia cuando subimos a un escenario. Tras bambalinas también evocaste un viaje en tren surrealista con Juan Villoro hacia un pueblo llamado Tequila como Comala espejismo borroso y mareado de un puro paisaje de párrafos y allí mismo en el camerino de Monterrey después del escenario te conté de mi amigo Philippe y la insomne madrugada que se alargó en raros instantes luego de que habías inaugurado al lado de Álvaro Mutis y Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas la Casa Refugio Citlaltépetl en una colonia Condesa ultravigilada en una parte acordonada de la ciudad más grande del mundo donde apenas cortaste el listón te sacaron en helicóptero con rumbo a una playa invisible porque había rumores de un comando fanático que pretendía aplicarte la fetwa del anciano profeta de Irán.

Pero no sabías que al comando le cayó encima la fetwa de Moctezuma en forma de una diarrea galopante y tripartita por obra y gracia de los taquitos de suadero que se echaron los mujáidines la noche anterior a su fracasado operativo y remember que te conté que a mi Philippe lo despertó la Policía Judicial durante la madrugada en que ya dormías en esa playa invisible para informarle inquirir e insinuar en torno al increíble descubrimiento de unas cajas con dinamita que se hallaron bajo la escalinata de la casona ahora de Refugio para Escritores y que todo se debía al raro azar de que el inmueble había pertenecido a un ingeniero en minas que todo ello nada tenía que ver con el listón que habías cortado el día anterior y que se supone que esos mismos judiciales habían revisado cada milímetro de la casona al tiempo que acordonaban una porción considerable de la Ciudad de México.

Reímos. Reíamos en Monterrey la hermosa vida los amigos que nos unen los libros que compartimos en dos idiomas… y el tiempo que no es más que un instante. Pero reímos también porque para presentarte ante el publico de la Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León optamos por el sendero del humor que destila tu persona y casi todos tus libros. Quien te lea y conozca Salmán se llevará la agradable sorpresa de la prosa alegre el jardín feliz de la memoria la ligereza del sarcasmo inteligente tan alejado del pastelazo y el chistorete… pero para eso hay que leerte y más ahora que se confirma que quienes te odian y atacan sólo han leído una o dos páginas de uno solo de tus libros y aún así se abrogan irracionalmente el empeño de Matar.

Matar es lo que hace la ignorancia y el necio empecinamiento de la estulticia; matar es derramar la sangre a contrapelo de intentar el entendimiento incluso de lo incomprensible y matar es el pan de cada día desde que –sin leerte—te condenaba a muerte la locura y Matar es ahora el diablo tras las rejas al que había que condenar a leerte a ser leído en cada tramo de los horarios de su condena que ha de durar todo el tiempo y apenas un eléctrico instante en que algún policía le informó que no había logrado quitarte la vida.

Remember que te confié de una joven pareja de recién casados que intentaron volar de Madrid a México el mismo día en que los ayatolás amenazaron dinamitar los aviones de Iberia porque los editores unidos de España acababan de publicar Los versos satánicos. Otra línea otro avión de diferente bandera sustituyó el vuelo de esos recién casados para Holanda y allí detuvieron al novio por verlo sospechoso y porque cargaba un Walkman como el que usaron los terroristas del avión PanAm sobre Lockerbie… y nos reímos en Monterrey del novio revisado como delincuente porque leía Los versos satánicos que afortunadamente pudo terminar de leer antes de aterrizar en la Ciudad de México absuelto de sospechas holandesas y herido apenas por una neuralgia del trigémino que lo tentaba a tirarse de cabeza desde el avión de KLM sobre el Atlántico como patiño incómodo que acompañara a los dos personajes de esa novela sobre satánicos versos que se vuelven arcángeles al caer al vacío desde un avión dinamitado por terroristas de verdad aunque esfumados en la generosa ficción que transpira la tinta de tu pluma.

Reímos a dos voces de una tarde que se volvió noche en que Paul Auster me confundió creyendo que yo era gringo alrededor de las calles del Círculo de Bellas Artes de Madrid y lloramos ambos –sin lágrimas—las tres décadas en que se fueron evaporando amores y sí una sola lágrima compartida y apenas visible frente al público en Monterrey porque tuvo que pasar todo ese tiempo ese único y mismo instante para finalmente abrazarte con la gratitud de quien por leerte se convertía en aliado y cómplice.

Reímos recordando la voz de Octavio Paz y la camaradería de Carlos Fuentes en un Londres que recorrías a escondidas de refugio en escondite de librerías disfrazado y siempre de amoroso padre de tu hijo. Remember que eres rostro casi siempre sonriente ya por el humor de tu inmensa inteligencia y desatada imaginación o porque los ojos al medio filo de tus párpados parecen iniciar la sonrisa así te quedes con uno solo de tus ojos para mirar al mundo con palabras y cuajar el instante en que el novio de hace treinta años te pudiera abrazar en Monterrey y llorar juntos la eternidad del azar la novia que se esfuma como espuma de mar en la memoria el mismo ejemplar comprado hace tres décadas que firmaste en Monterrey y el mismo instante en que ayer Paul Auster y tantos escritores amigos se arremolinaban en la escalinata que lleva hacia las columnas de un tiempo inasible para celebrar tu vida voz y vocación… porque remember que todos tenemos el invaluable tesoro de hablar opinar pensar y plasmar en libertad que toda voz que se eleva con honestidad por encima de la necedad y todos los párrafos que se imprimen por encima del veneno autoritario navegan sobre nubes sin saber si han de ser leídos confiados en que alguien asegura con su mirada el ciclo ida y vuelta donde el lector remata el silencio de las sílabas que apenas pudiste murmurar al salir de la anestesia… porque eso no se puede matar.

Compartimos fotografías frases inspiradoras artículos que son de nuestro interés videos memes y un sinfín de información que nos parece relevante. Al compartir artículos de cualquier tema las personas lo hacen porque los han leído y les han interesado. Sin embargo un estudio nuevo indica que no todos se detienen a leer lo que publican pero creen que tienen el conocimiento del tema por tan solo compartirlo en sus redes.

Los investigadores Adrian Ward Frank Zheng y Susan Broniarczyk de la Universidad de Texas iniciaron un estudio que publicó el Journal of Consumer Psychology y muestra conclusiones interesantes.

El primer experimento que realizaron los expertos fue meramente para observar. Pidieron a los participantes elegir varios artículos de su interés pero no tenían que leerlos. Sin embargo tenían la opción de compartirlos con los siguientes participantes del estudio. Alrededor de 40% de las veces que los primeros participantes compartieron un artículo fue después de haberlo leído completamente; 20% de las veces que se compartió un artículo fue leído parcialmente; y 40% restante de las veces que se compartieron los artículos con los siguientes participantes no fueron leídos por los primeros.

La investigación no terminó ahí: los voluntarios completaron exámenes pequeños sobre los artículos (conocimiento objetivo) y midieron en una escala cuánto creían que sabían del tema del artículo (conocimiento subjetivo). El conocimiento subjetivo (su creencia sobre cuánto sabían) incrementó con la evaluación del conocimiento objetivo y curiosamente la escala de su conocimiento subjetivo también incrementó simplemente por el hecho de compartir el artículo sin importar si lo habían leído o no.

Creencias propias

En un segundo estudio los participantes midieron en una escala su conocimiento sobre una variedad de temas incluyendo la prevención del cáncer. Dos semanas después regresaron a otro experimento y leyeron un artículo sobre prevención de cáncer y otro sobre prevención de robo de identidad. Después de leer el artículo asignado los participantes podían compartir el artículo sobre la prevención del cáncer en sus redes sociales o simplemente podían elegir revisar posibles publicaciones sin compartirlas. A continuación calificaron sus conocimientos subjetivos (lo que creen que saben) de una serie de temas incluyendo la prevención del cáncer.

Al igual que los resultados del primer estudio la creencia subjetiva de las personas sobre su conocimiento de la prevención del cáncer aumentó cuando compartieron la publicación en sus redes sociales sin importar si habían leído el artículo o no.

En otros experimentos se replicó este ejercicio y los resultados fueron los mismos: un aumento en la creencia subjetiva pero solamente al compartir artículos con personas que creían que verían de nuevo. Compartir artículos con extraños no provocaba cambios en sus propias creencias sobre su conocimiento.

Creo que este tipo de comportamiento nos puede pasar a todos. Quizá leemos un encabezado y un primer párrafo y creemos que comprendemos toda la información. Sin embargo pienso que antes de compartir algo hay que tratar de entenderlo. Y tú ¿compartes cosas sin leerlas?

Pero cuando las personas chatean día y noche puede generar algunas notificaciones molestas. Afortunadamente la aplicación tiene características que hacen posible navegar con gracia por sus muchos chats. Además de poder limitar tus notificaciones silenciando conversaciones y dejando los chats de grupo en silencio también puedes ver los mensajes sin que el remitente lo sepa.

Razones para eliminar la función para que remitente se entere que el mensaje fue leído

Hay una variedad de razones por las que es posible que desee ver un mensaje de WhatsApp sin que el remitente vea que lo ha leído. Tal vez solo tiene prisa y no tiene tiempo para responder pero aún desea ver lo que su mejor amigo de larga distancia le envió sin que piensen que se están quedando en lectura. O tal vez planeas leer y no responder a ese mensaje de texto de “registro” de tu ex pero no quieres darle la satisfacción de saber que lo leíste.

Cualquiera que sea su razonamiento si está buscando evitar que esa doble marca de verificación se vuelva azul en la pantalla del remitente aquí le mostramos cómo ver un mensaje de WhatsApp sin enviar un recibo de lectura.

¿Cómo leer sin que el remitente vea?

Para desactivar los recibos de lectura abra WhatsApp y haga clic en el icono de engranaje de Configuración en la parte inferior derecha de su pantalla. A continuación toque “Cuenta” y luego toque “Privacidad”.

Desplácese hacia abajo hasta el botón Leer recibos y apáguelo. Es importante tener en cuenta que los recibos de lectura siempre se envían en chats grupales por lo que esto solo funcionará para uno a uno. Al desactivar los recibos de lectura tampoco podrá ver si alguien más ha leído sus mensajes."

In the last year we’ve heard reports about the Astroworld tragedy the backstage killing of Drakeo the Ruler and an onstage attack on Dave Chappelle. What all of these events have in common besides being tragic and unsettling is the involvement of concert promoter Live Nation. And taken together they raise a significant question: is there more the company could be doing to prevent future tragedies?



In a new investigation for the Los Angeles Times August Brown took a deeper look into Live Nation’s security practices and found a few unsettling gaps. The investigation included conversations with experts in the field and a review of lawsuits pertaining to Live Nation events; the picture it paints offers a glimpse into how a massive company focused on event promotion can get some essential components of event security wrong.



Among the people Brown spoke with was a security guard who argued that Live Nation had understaffed several events they had worked on which led to “chaotic” atmospheres when the existing security personnel were unable to provide crowd control during tense situations.



A spokesperson for Live Nation disputed the idea that disparate incidents reflected anything greater. “It’s misleading to say there is a pattern of issues when the nature of the incidents at those events was fundamentally different” they told the Times.



A recent report from The Guardian noted that in the wake of Astroworld last year a number of musicians are taking it upon themselves to respond to tense situations at concerts. And while that’s admirable there’s also a scale beyond which that doesn’t seem feasible.



Whether or not the Times investigation — or say Congress’s investigation of Astroworld — will result in tangible changes is as yet unclear. But they may well leave concertgoers with a few more things on their mind the next time they go to see live music.

Philadelphia is about to get not one but three new independent music venues.

Avram Hornik the nightlife impresario and restaurateur is back in the live music business.

Hornik’s company FCM Hospitality’s ventures include Harper’s Garden in Center City Lola’s Garden in Ardmore and Morgan’s Pier and Liberty Point on the Delaware River the latter of which is Philadelphia’s largest outdoor restaurant.

When music venues Union Transfer and Boot & Saddle opened in 2011 and 2013 Hornik was part owner though he later sold his interest in both. (Boot & Saddle closed in 2020 due to the COVID-19 shutdown.)

Now Hornik is reentering the live music space with venues in Center City South Philly and Fishtown.

The 500-capacity Concourse Live will begin presenting indie bands at its Market Street address next month. The 200-capacity dance club the Dolphin Tavern on South Broad Street has already added a steady stream of live acts to the DJ calendar. And a third venue on North Delaware Avenue that will hold 700 is targeting an early-2023 opening.

All will be produced by Philly Independent Productions the new concert division of FCM.

Local and national bands are being booked by Marley McNamara the Philly music scene veteran who’s an alum of Fishtown club Johnny Brenda’s and former manager of acts like Lititz Pa. quartet The Districts.

The small- to medium-sized venue live music business is highly competitive especially for independent venues like World Cafe Live Johnny Brenda’s MilkBoy Philly Ardmore Music Hall 118 North The Fire and Kung Fu Necktie which are not affiliated with deep-pocketed corporate concerns Live Nation and AEG Live.

So what makes Hornik want to get back into a business where profit margins are thin and touring artists are struggling to sell tickets to budget- and COVID-cautious fans?

“I like to say that I’m in the public space business” says Hornik 49 who started out operating the Quarry St. Cafe in Old City in the 1990s.

His succession of Philly bars many with a DJ component have included Lucy’s Hat Shop Soma Lounge Butter and Proto Lounge and Bar Noir. His Parks on Tap beer garden partner is Philadelphia Parks & Recreation. This summer Liberty Point has presented a Tuesday night Philly Grown: Food & Music series paring local chefs and bands.

“That’s what I really like: how people socialize together” Hornik says sitting at a high-top table with McNamara and Matt Schenck the production manager and engineer in charge of sound at FCM venues.

“

I just think there is a pent-up demand for that. . People want to gather together and there’s no better reason to than to hear live music.”

Here’s a look at the three new venues.

Concourse Live

The FCM venue set to make the biggest splash soonest is Concourse Live a spacious subterranean 500-capacity room at 1635 Market Street that could hardly be more conveniently located for commuters. It has an entrance from the concourse at Suburban Station.

Concourse Live will open on Sept. 10 with the Philadelphia Tom Petty Appreciation Band the local all-star ensemble fronted by Pat Finnerty that features members of Dr. Dog The War on Drugs and Strand of Oaks. On Oct. 9 the venue will host Philly buzz band Cosmic Guilt and Peter Bauer of The Walkmen at a kick-off party for the Philly Music Fest (PMF) which begins the next night at Ardmore Music Hall.

Rapper Chill Moody brass band Snacktime Philly indie rockers Clap Your Hands Say Yeah soul band Arthur Thomas & the Funkitorium and The Districts all have Concourse Live dates in the fall.

As a live music venue Concourse Live is a new entity but it’s not an entirely new venture for Hornik. As Concourse Dance Bar the converted off track betting parlor has been open since 2018 pulling in a young crowd with DJs booked by Rylan Murphy as well as a ball pit and an ice bar.

In 2018 The Inquirer’s Samantha Melamed called it a “hallucinogenic” experience in a “nostalgic playground.” That aspect of Concourse will continue with DJs starting after the bands finish. Live shows on weekends will start at 7 and end by 10.

Dolphin Tavern

The Dolphin Tavern the South Philly dive bar/dance club at 1539 S. Broad St. which is already in Hornik’s portfolio has been an indie DJ haven since FCM took it over in 2013.

With the Boot & Saddle gone the 200-capacity Dolphin will aim to be “that missing South Philly venue” says McNamara complete with the old B&S sound system which Hornik bought when the club shut down.

The venue will keep the disco ball action going with DJs but also add indie bands during the week. Among them: Queasy on Sept. 9 Grace Vonderkuhn on Sept. 29 and Tonstartssbandht on Nov. 6 .

(How long the Dolphin will have South Broad to itself is uncertain. In March The Inquirer reported that Boot & Saddle had plans to reopen as a collaboration between South Philly bar Fountain Porter and avant jazz presenter Ars Nova Workshop but a timetable has yet to be announced. )

Craft Hall

A name hasn’t been settled on for the third venue in the Philly Independent Productions’ plan that will be built at Craft Hall Hornik’s brewery and restaurant at 901 N. Delaware Ave.

“We’re going back and forth between ‘The Philly Independent’ and ‘The Independent Philly’” McNamara says. The room will have a separate entrance from Craft Hall and will be larger than the Dolphin and Concourse Live. This will help bands move into larger venues a concept called horizontal integration Hornik explains.

“You want to be able to book a band in a 200-cap room and then a 500-cap room and then a 700-cap room. So you want to be able to move the bands up and have them realize that this is an independent alternative for the Philadelphia market.”

The pressure on the new live music rooms to succeed Hornik says will be less “because these venues already exist and are profitable as is so we have a lot more leeway to take care of the bands better and have more competitive ticket pricing and pay people more because we don’t have to worry about rent or insurance or electricity.”

The entry of three new indie venues will increase competition but also new opportunities. With the Dolphin McNamara will be bidding for shows against similar-sized rooms like Johnny Brenda’s PhilaMOCA and MilkBoy Philly.

The latter however is currently closed for repairs and will likely stay shuttered into the fall Tommy Joyner MilkBoy’s co-owner (and leader of the band Pep Rally) said last week. Until it reopens MilkBoy is shuffling shows to other venues. McNamara said she had been in discussion about potentially moving some of them — like South Philly songwriter Shamir’s Oct. 14 Philly Music Fest date — to the Dolphin.

“I think it’s terrific” said PMF chief Greg Seltzer on the addition of the FCM venues. He teamed with McNamara adding the kick-off event to the nonprofit fest and plans to continue to partner with Philly Independent Productions.

“More independent venues means more places for venue staff to work and more places for emerging bands to cut their teeth. And geographically the venues make sense with the Dolphin in South Philly and also the venue in that part of Center City” because in terms of small rock venues “nothing else is there.”

Concourse Live’s size puts it between World Cafe Live in West Philly and City Winery Philadelphia which hold 650 and 350 people respectively. There aren’t that many concert spaces that size in Philadelphia says Hornik.

While there are many venues with around a 2000-seat capacity including the Miller Theater (formerly the Merriam) Academy of Music Verizon Hall the Fillmore Franlin Music Hall and the even larger The Met that 500-person range is neglected Hornik says.

“I feel like the rooms that are that size have their own niche. This is going to be a room for independent artists of all different genres” McNamara says.

McNamara says she expects that once all three venues are up and running there will be approximately 100 shows each year at both Concourse Live and the larger venue at Craft Hall and closer to 150 at the Dolphin because we’re going to do a lot more local shows there.”

“I don’t think we’re going to be taking market share from these other venues” Hornik says. “I think there’s a gap in the market and we’re going to make the whole pie larger.”

When the first laser was invented by Theodore Maiman at the Hughes Research Lab in Malibu California in 1960 it was almost immediately seen as a potential superweapon – the death-ray of science fiction come to life.

While the ability to generate beams of coherent light provided scientists and engineers with a unique tool that would revolutionize many fields over the next six decades producing a practical laser weapon turned out to be more difficult than first imagined. Today the development of solid-state lasers based on coils of fiber optic cables doped with exotic elements like yttrium have finally moved the laser weapon from the laboratory to the battlefield.

The HELIOS laser weapon installed Lockheed Martin

The HELIOS 60-plus-kW-class multirole laser weapon will not just be deployed as an experiment aboard a US Navy ship as in previous tests but as an operational tactical system that can be fully integrated into ship operations and can be scaled to meet mission requirements. Like other laser weapons HELIOS can project a beam at the speed of light against multiple targets for about a dollar a shot not counting equipment costs and has an unlimited supply of ammunition so long as power is available.

Where HELIOS differs is that it can not only be used to destroy targets it can also to dazzle optical sensors and the reflected beam can gather long-range data for Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) applications. According to Lockheed this makes HELIOS a key element of a layered defense architecture for fleet protection.

""Lockheed Martin and the US Navy share a common vision and enthusiasm for developing and providing disruptive laser weapon systems"" said Rick Cordaro vice president Lockheed Martin Advanced Product Solutions. ""HELIOS enhances the overall combat system effectiveness of the ship to deter future threats and provide additional protection for sailors and we understand we must provide scalable solutions customized to the Navy’s priorities. HELIOS represents a solid foundation for incremental delivery of robust and powerful laser weapon system capabilities.""

Captain Kirk Spock and the rest of the Star Trek gang were in constant dialogue with the onboard Enterprise computer asking it questions about the starship and their alien environments.

With NASA reviving its human space exploration program through Artemis it seems only natural real astronauts of the 2020s who will crew the forthcoming space missions would do the same. After all boldly going where no one has gone before could be lonely and having an A.I. sidekick might help on those long voyages.

When Lockheed Martin the company that built the new Orion spacecraft for NASA first dreamed up the talking computer engineers figured they'd just throw an Amazon Echo Dot on the dashboard with a laptop and call it a day. But it wasn't nearly that simple said Rob Chambers Lockheed's director of commercial civil space strategy.

Beyond technical constraints they had to overcome the menacing representations of an inflight space computer in the vein of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Unlike the collegial computer in Star Trek ""HAL"" starts to glitch takes control of the spacecraft and then fights the crew's attempts to shut it down.

That's not merely a concern raised through science fiction. This summer A.I. developer Blake Lemoine formerly of Google went public with his belief that a chatbot he helped build had become sentient. The story sparked a global conversation about whether some artificial intelligence is — or could be — conscious.

Such claims work to reinforce fears long embedded in popular culture — that one day the advanced technology enabling humans to achieve extraordinary things could be too smart perhaps leading to machines that are self aware and want to hurt people.

""We don't want the HAL 9000 'I'm sorry Dave. I can't open the pod bay doors'"" Chambers told Mashable. ""That's the first thing that everybody said when we first suggested this.""

""We don't want the HAL 9000 'I'm sorry Dave. I can't open the pod bay doors.That's the first thing that everybody said when we first suggested this.""

Rather Lockheed Martin and its collaborators believe having a voice-activated virtual assistant and video calls in the spacecraft would be more convenient for astronauts affording them access to information away from the crew console. That flexibility might even keep them safer engineers say.

An experiment to test the technology is riding along with Artemis on its first spaceflight. The project named Callisto after one of Artemis' favorite hunting companions in Greek mythology is programmed to give crew live answers about the spacecraft's flight status and other data such as water supply and battery levels. The companies are paying for the technology — not NASA.

A custom Alexa system built specifically for the spacecraft will have access to some 120000 data readouts — more than astronauts have had before with some bonus information previously only available within Houston's mission control.

No astronaut will actually be onboard Orion for this first mission — unless the dummy in the cockpit counts. But the inaugural 42-day spaceflight testing various orbits and atmosphere reentry will clear the way for NASA to send a crew on subsequent missions. Whether a virtual assistant is integrated into the spacecraft for those expeditions depends on a successful demonstration during Artemis I.

Mission control also will use video-conferencing software provided by Cisco Webex inside the spacecraft. Cisco will run its software on an iPad in the capsule. Cameras mounted all over Orion will monitor how the system is working.

For the most part the virtual assistant will answer queries like ""Alexa how fast is Orion traveling?"" and ""Alexa what's the temperature in the cabin?"" The only thing the system can actually control are the lights said Justin Nikolaus an Alexa voice designer on the project.

""As far as control of the vehicle we don't have access to any critical components or mission critical software onboard"" Nikolaus told Mashable. ""We're safely sandboxed in Orion.""

The space-faring Alexa might not seem so advanced. But engineers had to figure out how to get the device to recognize a voice in a tin can. The acoustics of Orion with mostly metal surfaces were unlike anything developers had encountered before. What they learned from the project is now being applied to other challenging sound environments on Earth like detecting speech in a moving car with the windows rolled down Nikolaus said.

The most significant change from off-the-shelf Amazon devices is that the system will debut a new technology the company calls ""local voice control"" which allows Alexa to work without an internet connection. Back on Earth Alexa operates on the cloud which runs on the internet and uses computer servers warehoused in data centers.

In deep space when Orion is hundreds of thousands of miles away the time delays to reach the cloud will be shall we say astronomical. Looking toward the future that lag could stretch from seconds to an hour to transmit messages back and forth to a spacecraft on its way to Mars about 96 million miles from Earth.

That's why engineers built a spacecraft computer to handle the data processing Chambers said.

""It's not canned things. It's actual real-time processing"" he said. ""All that smarts has to be on the spacecraft because we didn't want to suffer the time lag of going back up to the spacecraft back down to Earth back up and back down again.""

""All that smarts has to be on the spacecraft because we didn't want to suffer the time lag of going back up to the spacecraft back down to Earth back up and back down again.""

For the questions that Alexa can't handle offline Callisto will tap into the Deep Space Network the radio dish system NASA uses to communicate with its farthest spacecraft and route the signals to the cloud on Earth. This could allow Callisto to support a wider range of requests like reading the news or reporting sports scores.

Or ordering more toilet paper and trash bags. Seriously.

The designers built in the capability for astronauts to buy things from Amazon. Overnight delivery to the moon wouldn't be an option but sending flowers to a spouse on Earth for a special occasion would.

Cisco also will use the Deep Space Network to provide video-conferencing calls. Engineers say astronauts would be able to use this tool for ""whiteboarding"" meetings with their Houston colleagues. Imagine how handy that would have been for the Apollo 13 crew as NASA tried to talk them through how to make a round air filter fit into a square hole with no visual aids.

Broadcasting pictures in high resolution across the solar system isn't easy especially with such limited data capacity. One of the reasons Lockheed Martin chose Cisco as a collaborator was for the company's expertise in video compression Chambers said. As video travels through space the data can get garbled. Cisco worked on error-correction technology to smooth out the transmissions.

""One of my colleagues at Cisco refers to this as trying to do 4K high bandwidth gigabit-type ethernet using a 1980s dial-up modem"" he said. ""Obviously the Deep Space Network is very very capable but we're trying to do modern video-conferencing.""

""One of my colleagues at Cisco refers to this as trying to do 4K high bandwidth gigabit-type ethernet using a 1980s dial-up modem.""

To make the custom virtual assistant the collaborators spent time interviewing astronauts. One of the things they asked for was a dictation service Nikolaus said. Often their notepads and pens float away. It's hard to use a computer in a weightless environment too.

""If you go to a keyboard and you're not used to microgravity and you start typing your force on the keyboard pushes your body away from it"" Nikolaus said.

But: Alexa can you fly me to the moon?

Yes if what you want is a little Frank Sinatra crooning through the cabin.

Alexa can you open or close the pod bay doors?

Fortunately no. The system can't do anything to put the astronauts in danger Chambers said.

""We think about that a lot not necessarily that they'll become sentient and you know Rise of the Machines and [become] our software overlords"" he said.

But software is complex. Strange behaviors can occur through unexpected convolutions of activities he said: ""What we do is we architect the system such that it is actually not possible for this device to talk to this other device.""

So if all goes according to plan perhaps the most havoc the real HAL could cause is to prank an astronaut's family with an unwanted Amazon Fresh pizza delivery.

US Aims For Third Successful Hypersonic ARRW Missile Test After 3 Consecutive Failures,"The US Air Force (USAF) seeks to fly its hypersonic AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW) at least once more this year after two successful tests in the last four months according to reports.

Gen. Duke Richardson the head of Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) told reporters on August 10 during the AFMC’s Life Cycle Industry Day event in Dayton Ohio that the upcoming test will be a “big one” for ARRW.

The AGM-183A ARRW is a long-range hypersonic missile designed by Lockheed Martin for the USAF. The missile is expected to improve USAF’s hypersonic strike capability to attack heavily defended high-value targets such as enemy military bases and surface warships at stand-off ranges.

The missile is said to have a speed over Mach 5 and a range of approximately 925 kilometers. It is carried under the wing of the B-52H bomber aircraft.

The high-speed component of the missile is being developed utilizing the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency’s (DARPA) tactical boost glide (TBG) technology where a rocket first propels its payload to hypersonic speeds following which the payload separates from the rocket and glides unpowered toward the target.

Winning Streak After Three Consecutive Failures

The last known test of the ARRW was conducted in July off the Southern California coast which successfully demonstrated the booster performance marking the completion of the booster test phase according to the press release by Eglin Air Force Base. Also the trial marked the second time the ARRW had effectively separated from the B-52 aircraft.

Before that the 419th Flight Test Squadron and the Global Power Combined Test Force conducted a test in May in which the ARRW separated from the launch aircraft and the rocket burned for “the expected duration” marking the first successful test after a string of three failures in 2021.

The three test flights in 2021 failed because the missile could not separate from the carrier aircraft or failed to launch a booster rocket. The root cause analysis of the most recent failed test suggested that a loose wire did not allow the missile to function as intended.

The US lawmakers cut $161 million in procurement funding that the Biden administration sought for the program in fiscal 2022 following test failures and delays.

Speaking about these test failures and the two consecutive successes after that Gen. Richardson said he’s been pleased with the Air Force’s progress on ARRW and described the initial failures as “burps” reported Defense News.

“There is more of an appetite now for test failure. It’s part of the process” Richardson said. “What we need to do is figure out how we get through failure faster. Because we’re going to fail.”

Road Ahead Is Challenging For ARRW

Lockheed Martin’s Deputy Program Manager for the ARRW program Brian Shappacher said on August 13 during the podcast hosted by the Mitchell Institute that the next phase of testing for the AGM-183A is going to be more complicated than the booster test phase.

“We’re still going to focus on the booster of course but we’re going to shift some additional focus to the glider performance” Shappacher said.

The USAF requires the ARRW to attain early operational capability in 2023 which according to Shappacher will be challenging.

“We have more missiles to build and more flight tests to get through and complete than we’ve had at any other time in this program intending to reach early operational capability in 2023” Shappacher noted.

USAF Riding Two Horses To Achieve Hypersonic Capability

Hypersonic weapons are a top priority for the US particularly in response to Russia and China’s progress in this field.

Currently China and Russia are the only countries with operational hypersonic weapons and Russia has even used its Kinzhal hypersonic missile in the ongoing Ukraine war. In contrast the US is still catching up.

Apart from ARRW the USAF is also pursuing the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile (HACM) program which intends to develop a smaller less expensive cruise missile based on air-breathing propulsion technology.

For the HACM program Lockheed Martin is competing with Raytheon and Boeing and the USAF is expected to award a contract later this year.

The USAF’s F-15EX fighter aircraft will be the first to be certified to carry the new HACM as the fighter jet has a larger weapons payload capacity than the F-35 fighter as per a previous EurAsian Times report.

Also reports suggest the HACM is planned to be launched from both bombers and fighter aircraft with a senior USAF official noting that a B-52 could potentially carry 20 HACMs or more.

Gen. Richardson said that by pursuing the ARRW and HACM the USAF is “riding two horses” in terms of hypersonic development setting itself up for a dilemma if there arises a situation where a single effort has to be selected for future investment.

Kawasaki’s official WorldSBK riders Jonathan Rea and Alex Lowes joined several of their championship rivals for a weekend test at the Kawasaki Racing Team’s local Barcelona – Catalunya circuit.

On-track action started on Saturday 20 August with the second and final day on Sunday 21. Due to the limits placed on the number of approved testing days over a season each rider chose when to take to the circuit and when to sit things out.

In generally hot conditions the 4.657km long circuit near the KRT squad’s own HQ gave both riders and their pit crews a chance to evaluate the kind of set-up options they cannot try out in race weekends due to time constraints during practice and qualifying.

Sunday’s action was ended by a fall of rain in the final 30 minutes by which time both KRT riders had reached their personal pre-test targets.

Rea started his own Barcelona test schedule on Saturday afternoon setting the best lap of the first day in hot conditions. He was to set the best lap of the weekend in the slightly cooler conditions of Sunday morning with a 1’40.913.

Lowes tested his Ninja ZX-10RR for a full day on Saturday but only Saturday evaluating set-up options designed for the hot track conditions. His place was taken on track on Sunday by Florian Marino.

Lowes set his best lap time of 1’42.358 on the busy opening day having made just over 90 laps of the circuit.

The WorldSBK championship returns to race action at Magny Cours in France between 9-11 September. The Circuit de Barcelona – Catalunya will host round eight of the WorldSBK championship just two weeks after Magny Cours.

Jonathan Rea stated: “It has been a really solid two days of testing. We started in the afternoon in the hot temperatures of day one and straight away I got the rhythm for the track temperature which got to the high forties and then 50°C. It was good to take the rhythm like that on day one. Step-by-step we worked through the test plan. We had some ideas during the season that we can only try at a test without the stress of a race weekend. So it is good to check these things at a test. One of the things we had in mind was changing my position on the bike to see what influence that would have. We drew some positive results from that. Also the electronics side of the bike is an area where we never stop working. We understood how to take that forward. Aside from that it was a great two days to test in hot conditions. I was able to be quite fast and consistent in these hotter conditions. We know it is an area we still need to improve on but the first signs were positive. We focused on race starts on day two in the afternoon trying to understand the best set-up from an electronic and mechanical point of view. And also my style at the starts. I really enjoyed my bike these last two days and it has been nice to fill in the WorldSBK summer break again after being at Suzuka on a different bike. So it is nice to come back here to understand the Pirelli tyres and the WorldSBK spec Ninja ZX-10RR.”

Alex Lowes stated: “We just did one day of testing at Montmelo a hot day which was perfect for us. Our target was to improve our rear performance in hotter more slippery track conditions. I think on Saturday afternoon we did a good job with that. We tried a lot of different set-up combinations on the rear of the bike to get me into a bit of a better position exiting corners to get more grip. We found some positive results and it was fun. This was a good test and I enjoyed being back in WorldSBK mode with all my guys. I feel quite optimistic for when we go back racing at Magny Cours. I really enjoyed this test.”

Pere Riba Crew Chief for Jonathan Rea stated: “We did half a day on Saturday and one complete day on Sunday. We mainly prepared a starting point for the Montmelo race in September and of course finding some areas we can improve in. These were mainly on the electronics side. We finally reached all the things we wanted to try. Johnny finished with a good feeling and we collected all the info we wanted from our plan. We are now ready to go to Magny Cours for the next round.”

Marcel Duinker Crew Chief for Alex Lowes stated: “We know that this track has been not very friendly with our set-up in the past couple of years so we were happy to have this test here at this time of year. We knew it was going to be hot so we took this opportunity to improve our bike in these hot and slippery track conditions. We had a clear target for this test. We wanted to improve some very important parts of our chassis package mainly through the set-up. We were fast and consistent so we ended this test happy because we reached our target.”

Oliver König (Orelac Racing VerdNatura) and new rider Oscar Gutierrez (TPR Team Pedercini Racing) were also testing at Montmelo with Gutierrez signed up to ride at the next two WorldSBK events for TPR.

Team HRC concludes a very positive test in sunny Catalunya

Factory Team HRC have completed a successful two-day test in hot and sunny conditions at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya where they shared the circuit with many other WorldSBK teams.

With a maiden 2022 Suzuka8H win still a fresh memory for Iker Lecuona and an HRC contract extension option exercised for Xavi Vierge two happy and motivated riders used this mid-summer test session as preparation for the second half of the season while adapting their bike set-up to suit the fast Spanish layout ahead of their home round that will run at the same circuit over the weekend of September 23-25.

On track from 10:00 to 18:00 on day one and losing only the final half hour on day two due to a thunderstorm Iker and Xavi focused on various aspects of their bike set-up including the electronics and mapping settings and compared a multitude of components including some linkages Pirelli tyres and on Iker’s side a new handbrake system.

Having responded positively to the intense work carried out over the two days with their respective crews the riders will now take a final two weeks off before returning to the track in Magny-Cours France on Friday 9 September for round seven of the WorldSBK Championship.

Iker Lecuona 7

“Generally speaking I’m very happy with these two test days. On the morning of day one we struggled with the brake setup and it also took me some time to readapt to the tyres and find my position on the bike the setup of which is quite different for the Suzuka 8h’s one. It took a few hours to sort all these things but we were able to fix everything in the early afternoon and start to work effectively. I began feeling good and comfortable on my bike again and I also tried a handbrake that I liked. I couldn’t fully exploit it on day one but the more I used it the more I got used to it and I think we will keep working in this area to further improve it. We tried a number of different setups finding good pace on used tyres and we also went for a fast lap with a qualifying tyre and were quick. So overall we leave here very happy.”

Xavi Vierge 97

“After having been forced to miss a lot of testing I’m really happy with how these two days have gone. We had some extra jobs to do after missing the Donington and Misano tests so we made many changes to the bike to understand the direction and we were able to make good progress particularly today. We have found the way and I’ve finally got back my good feeling on the bike and was able to find a strong race pace. It was just a pity we couldn’t try a soft tyre which was something we had planned for the final minutes of the session but then a storm forced us to pit. As I said it was a very productive test that I hope will prove helpful during the second part of the season. I’m also pleased with a view to next year of course – you can be sure that the team and I will continue to aim for the top where we want to be.”

Pata Yamaha with Brixx WorldSBK Completes Summer Test in Barcelona

Defending FIM Superbike World Champion Toprak Razgatlıoğlu and teammate Andrea Locatelli completed 1.5 days of running with the Pata Yamaha with Brixx WorldSBK squad for a mid-season summer test at Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya today.

The main objective for both riders was to work on the set-ups of their Yamaha R1 WorldSBKs in the hot conditions for the Catalunya Round on 23-25 September with a particular focus on generating rear grip in 30-plus degree temperatures. The team also had the chance to trial a new front tyre option from Pirelli.

On the first day Razgatlıoğlu completed 79 laps and ran for 43 laps on Day 2 before a high-side on the exit of Turn 5 ended his half day at 43 laps. He was taken to the medical centre for checks and then local hospital to close a minor wound on his elbow.

“Loka” finished his 1.5-day test after 74 laps on the first day and 56 laps through to 2pm making positive improvements on his lap time and #55 set-up to prepare for the second half of the 2022 WorldSBK season.

Next on the summer schedule is a special guest appearance at Cadwell Park with the McAMS Yamaha British Superbike Team as both Razgatlıoğlu and Locatelli will tackle “The Mountain” for demo laps in front of a packed UK Bank Holiday crowd.

Toprak Razgatlıoğlu

“It was a good test for me and also for Loka because we ride the bike after a long summer break. We are always ready to race but also we try some new set-up for the Catalunya Round a very positive day for me. I am happy for Loka for his very good lap time he is also very strong at this track and I hope in the race weekend we are on the podium together. On the second day today I had a big crash but I am okay. We tried the new tyre just some laps and maybe we can use it in the race weekend – we will see. Thanks to the Pata Yamaha with Brixx team for this test. Now in one week we go to Cadwell Park with McAMS I am excited for this!”

Andrea Locatelli

“It was important to ride the bike and to understand where we need to improve the mechanical set-up and some electronics here. We improved a lot in respect to yesterday – and probably yesterday was some strange conditions compared to normal with the heat and track surface. But this morning the feeling came immediately. I’m happy because I think now we can arrive here in one month with a lot more focus and information. It was also important to ride so that we didn’t stop for a lot of time between the races. We tried the new front tyre and the feeling was a little bit different to the standard tyre we use on a race weekend but it will be interesting to also try maybe in Magny-Cours. It’s a positive test for sure in general the feeling is good and when we arrive in France we can restart quickly and work to try to close the gap to the front guys. I want to try to get the podium to be honest we work for this and to continue to believe in myself and try to get some good results.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vdXNyYXJhY2luZy5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXdzX2FydGljbGUuYXNwP05ld3NJRD04NjI1MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,United States Racing Association | Simon Lowe Barton conquer Bolivar,Third time is a charm at least that is the old saying as we try again to get week 5 of the 2024 racing season in at I-35 Speedway.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Marcus Semien and Nathaniel Lowe homered Kohei Arihara pitched a career-high six innings and combined with Taylor Hearn for the shutout and the Texas Rangers beat the Minnesota Twins 7-0 on Sunday.

Minnesota starter Joe Ryan held Texas hitless for the first three innings before Semien led off the fourth with his 19th home run of the season. Semien drove in three runs.

Adolis García extended his hitting streak to 18 games the longest current streak in the majors.

The Rangers won for the third time in four games following a week of dramatic changes. The team fired fourth-year manager Chris Woodward on Monday. President of baseball operations Jon Daniels was fired on Wednesday.

“It’s almost like a clean slate with (interim manager Tony) Beasley” Semien said of last week's organizational changes. “When that stuff happened it just kind of wakes the room up. It’s unfortunate what happened last week but it wakes the room up and puts everyone on notice that we need to get our stuff together and start playing better.”

Arihara (1-1) was impressive in just his second major league start of the season. The right-hander from Japan spent most of the season at Triple-A Round Rock. He gave up four hits and pitched into the seventh inning.

“I was definitely more settled in this time more relaxed and got into a rhythm quickly” Arihara said through a translator.

Taylor Hearn came on in relief after the first two batters of the seventh singled off Arihara. Hearn retired three in a row to end the threat and finished off the final three innings for his first career save.

“We pitched outstanding” Beasley said. “Kohei he set the tone for us. I always say that pitching is the face of the game. So he set the tone. He kept us at bay. If he comes out and doesn’t pitch well none of this offense matters. So he kept the game in a spot where we had a chance to get going offensively.”

Ryan (9-6) allowed just two hits and two runs but he walked three and was done after 6 1/3 innings when Texas put together a three-run inning off Ryan and reliever Trevor Megill.

The Twins were shut out for the 11th time this season and now trail Cleveland by 1.5 games in the American League Central.

“We expected more from our offense” Minnesota manager Rocco Baldelli said. “And will expect more going forward a lot more. It was a day where there wasn’t much to even talk about. I think we rolled over on a lot of pitches. And it’s something I think we could have and should have been ready for. And I think we prepared for the type of pitcher we were facing today. The execution in the batter’s box has to be better.”

PICKING IT UP

After a slow start to his first season in Texas Semien is delivering the production expected when he signed a $175 million seven-year contract in the offseason.

Semien was hitting .193 with no homers on May 27. He hit his first home run a day later and now has 19 in 77 games since while hitting .256 during that stretch. With a career-high 19 stolen bases he’s closing in on his first 20-20 season.

Lowe hit his 18th homer. He’s hitting .364 since the All-Star break.

TWO MORE

Minnesota completed its Hall of Fame weekend by inducting former outfielder Dan Gladden and utility man César Tovar a day after an induction ceremony for former manager Ron Gardenhire.

Gladden was the leadoff hitter for the World Series-winning teams in 1987 and 1991. He played five seasons for the Twins and has spent the past 22 as a radio broadcaster for the team.

Tovar spent eight seasons with Twins hitting .281 with 186 steals which are third all-time for the team. In 1968 he became just the second player in history to play all nine positions in the same game.

TRAINER’S ROOM

Rangers: OF Kole Calhoun was activated from the injured list after recovering from right heel irritation. Calhoun had been out since Aug. 3 and played in three rehab games in Triple-A where he was 3 for 10 with a hit in each game. IF Josh Smith was optioned to Round Rock.

Twins: RHP Kenta Maeda (Tommy John surgery recovery) has been throwing and is scheduled for another trip to the doctor this week. He could begin throwing live batting practice after the checkup. … RHP Bailey Ober (right groin straight) is scheduled to throw a bullpen session on Monday. … OF Trevor Larnach (core muscle injury) has started hitting and running. … OF Kyle Garlick (right ribcage contusion) is close to a rehab assignment.

UP NEXT

The four-game series continues on Monday night. RHP Sonny Gray (7-3 3.11 ERA) starts for Minnesota while LHP Cole Ragans (0-2 5.02) will start for Texas. Gray tied a season high with 10 strikeouts in six scoreless innings in his last start. Ragans has allowed eight runs and four home runs in 9 1/3 innings over his last two starts.

You need to get over your reclining seat rage,"Editor’s Note: Heather Poole is a flight attendant for a major US carrier and author of “Cruising Attitude: Tales of Crashpads Crew Drama and Crazy Passengers at 30000 Feet.” The views in this commentary are her own. Read more CNN Opinion.

CNN —

Last night on a flight from London to New York a passenger rang his call light and when my colleague walked over turned off the light and asked him if he needed something he simply pointed to the reclined seat in front of him.

Heather Poole courtesy Heather Poole

The flight attendant told him that his seat was also in the reclined position and then mentioned that the seat next to him — the aisle seat — was available and that he could sit there. The man said he didn’t want to move to the aisle seat because he wanted to sit by the window.

Sometimes there are no solutions to problems like this.

Another day another flight: “If you put your seat back one more time I’m going to punch you in the face” said an older woman to a teenage girl seated in front of her. The young girl’s eyes looked like they might pop out of their sockets.

While standing in the aisle pouring a can of Diet Coke into a cup of ice I told the aggrieved passenger that nobody was going to punch anyone and that if she said another word about it or did anything to anyone authorities would be called to meet the flight.

“He’s in my lap!” cried a different passenger on a different flight. This one sat in the window seat.

I looked at the woman and then at the man in front who was clearly not in her lap. He was close though about a foot away. Sorry I mouthed. I handed her a can of club soda and a cup of ice and communicated to her in words I knew she’d understand: “Unfortunately he’s allowed to be in your lap.”

Besides lack of wifi or a broken entertainment system flight attendants hear more complaints about reclined seats than anything else.

The heart of the problem is that airlines are packing too many seats too closely together into a tight space. Remember legroom? But this squeeze doesn’t give passengers the right to react in such a way that the crew feels the need to divert a flight to have a passenger removed. That’s a really big deal that usually ends up with someone in police custody.

While I dread these altercations I think some passengers need to chill out — people have the right to recline their seat. Nobody has to ask for permission to recline their seat. Some people believe passengers have to put their seats in the upright position during the meal service. This isn’t true. At least not with US carriers even though it’s a nice thing to do.

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. Heather Poole

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. If you kick the seat or threaten to punch someone in the face you’ll be the one removed from the flight — not the person who moved their seat back two inches.

Not all airlines are created equal. Yes some airlines are taking away the recline option on all seats but these are mostly low-cost carriers which should tell you something about what those passengers want: cheap flights … including seats that don’t recline. (A friend who often flies Air France on short and medium-hop routes in Europe tells me that their seats are all locked upright. “I’ve never seen anyone get worked up about it” he said.)

Airlines are desperate to cut costs. It’s rumored that American Airlines removed a single olive off of business class meal trays and saved $40000 a year. So you’d think that 150 lighter seats per flight will certainly save an airline a ton of money. Remember the recline mechanism in the seat makes it heavier which increases fuel costs for the airline. A lighter seat that doesn’t recline is also a seat that is less likely to break which saves an airline money in repairs.

Non-reclining seats are nothing new. Major carriers have always had a few seats that don’t recline. Think exit rows and the last row. While some passengers aren’t always happy to get one of these seats it never seems to be that big of a deal.

But after 28 years in the job I’ve found there’s some basic reclining etiquette that makes for a smoother flight for everyone.

A reminder: chances are the person in front of you has no idea they’ve crossed that mental barrier between you and the rest of the world. You can’t kick them or scream at them but you can politely ask if they’d mind putting their seat back up. I bet if you ask nicely they’ll do it.

If you’re a passenger who likes to recline it’s always a good idea to be mindful of the situation that we are all collectively in and do so slowly. Yanking the seat back too quickly could make a mess if the person behind you has their tray table down.

Sure everyone feels cramped in coach seats. But the bigger you are the tighter the squeeze so consider glancing back before you adjust your seat. If it’s Shaquille O’Neal behind you maybe give the guy a break.

We do see spilled drinks and from time to time broken laptops. Seasoned business passengers know what to expect and book seats with more legroom. But on coach middle seat passengers struggle to type because there’s no arm space. The table is so much smaller these days and there’s barely room for a drink. So if you think you’re going to work on your laptop and balance a cup of coffee on that table well you might need to seriously rethink your spatial judgement.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned flying the unfriendly skies it’s this: you can’t please everyone. Somebody is going to suffer somebody is going to have a miserable flight somebody will be assigned the last row or a middle seat or will have to come into contact with a child. Now I’m going to tell you what I used to tell my son when he was little every time we traveled together: there’s no crying in flying. Toughen up.

Really this isn’t a war on reclined seats. This is about space and most airlines give you the option to purchase more space.

Even though I’m a Marriott Bonvoy Titanium member this was my first stay at a “standard” Marriott in the United States for as long as I can remember (I generally avoid Marriotts domestically). However this hotel had a convenient location for where we needed to be.

So with all the cost cutting we’ve seen at hotels in the United States since the start of the pandemic how was the stay? Not bad surprisingly…

Booking the Boston Marriott Newton

For our early August stay the Boston Marriott Newton was charging ~$190 per night plus tax.

We paid cash though as a point of comparison the hotel would have cost 39000 Marriott Bonvoy points per night if redeeming points. I value Bonvoy points at 0.7 cents each so paying cash was definitely the better deal as I prefer saving my points for higher value redemptions.

Boston Marriott Newton location

The hotel markets itself as the “Boston Marriott Newton” though you’re not going to want to stay here if you want to visit the city of Boston whether for business or leisure. Rather this is a hotel off a highway that’s near all kinds of businesses and commercial parks that have offices in the Newton area just outside of Boston.

If you’re staying here plan on having a car or ride sharing since the area isn’t ideal for walking. Fortunately parking is free if you come by car. The hotel is around 20-30 minutes (depending in traffic) from both the city of Boston and Boston Logan Airport (BOS).

While the hotel underwent a significant interior renovation in 2017 the exterior of the property could still use some love in my opinion.

While the hotel is a bit outdated from the outside the interior is fairly modern especially the lobby. Inside the entrance and to the left were two reception counters while the rest of the lobby consisted of a few different seating arrangements.

I was thanked for being a Bonvoy Titanium member and we were upgraded to a room with a balcony (this hotel has very few suites so I wasn’t expecting a further upgrade). It was also explained that on account of my status we’d receive access to the club lounge. However the club lounge is only open in the evenings so we could have breakfast in the restaurant. That worked for us and gave us the best of both worlds.

For what it’s worth the hotel has seven floors and the lobby is actually on the fourth floor. That’s because the hotel is built into a small hill so the side of the hotel you enter on is a bit elevated. We were assigned a room on the second floor.

Once we were down on the second floor we followed the signage in the direction of our room #229. The room was about halfway down the hall and on the left.

The room was pretty much brand standard for Marriott. I think this is often the issue with reviewing chain hotels that have cookie-cutter design. The room was exactly what you’d expect for a (fairly) recently renovated Marriott. On one side of the room was a king size bed and a chair with a lamp.

On the other side of the room was a desk with a rolling chair (it’s nice to see those in Marriott rooms since many hotels have eliminated desks) a wall-mounted TV and a luggage rack. There was also a minibar setup with a coffee machine and an empty mini fridge.

The bathroom had a sink toilet and shower & tub combo and was absolutely tiny to the point that you basically had to be touching the toilet with your leg in order to use the sink. On the plus side the water pressure in the shower was pretty decent.

Toiletries were from both Pharmacopia and thisworks and were pretty decent.

One thing that stood out to me about the room was the “popcorn” ceiling combined with a bad paint job which definitely didn’t feel very premium and doesn’t match the rest of the renovation.

The room also had not one but two connecting doors. There was one near the bathroom on one side of the room and one near the bed on the other side of the room. Usually that would bother me but surprisingly there was no noise from nearby rooms so it didn’t turn out to be an issue.

The room also had a balcony with two chairs and a side table.

The hotel overlooks the Charles River though our room just looked at a very big tree plus a permanent(ish) tent that was presumably set up for events.

All-in-all the room was perfectly nice and did the trick. When the hotel was renovated in 2017 I think the press release about the new rooms being the “pinnacle of luxury” is probably a bit of an exaggeration but… 😉

As a Bonvoy elite member I received premium internet for free which was fast. The hotel also offers daily housekeeping but only on demand. You couldn’t request it in advance but rather each morning you had to let the front desk know if you wanted housekeeping.

Boston Marriott Newton club lounge

As mentioned above the Marriott Newton has a club lounge on the seventh floor. At the moment it’s only open Sundays through Thursdays from 5PM until 10PM. It’s not open during the day and clearly the days of the week are designed around business travelers.

It’s sad how low our expectations as consumers have become as a result of coronavirus but I remember thinking to myself “wow how generous that they’ve opened the club lounge” given how many other hotels haven’t.

Marriott Newton club lounge exterior

The lounge itself was what you’d expect from a Marriott. There were some tables with a couple of chairs each some booths and some high-top seating near the windows.

What drives me bonkers about club lounges in the United States is how they assume everyone wants to watch TV. There were two TVs on in the lounge playing different things both at very high volumes. Am I the only one who wishes club lounges would go for a more relaxing ambiance? Why not play some calming background music or something?

The food spread was put out shortly after 5PM. Admittedly the quality of club lounges varies greatly around the globe so this one was pretty standard for a domestic property.

Marriott Newton club lounge buffet

The evening food selection consisted of a few types of packaged snacks (chips and granola bars) plus three fresh options.

Marriott Newton club lounge snacks

These options alternated slightly every evening but generally included some kind of salad some kind of fruit and some kind of veggies (in some cases with cheese). While the selection was limited frankly I appreciated that the options were fresh and reasonably healthy. Other properties have much less healthy options with things like pigs in a blanket fried spring rolls and nachos with cheese. So kudos to the hotel for that at least.

In terms of drinks there was complimentary bottled water and soft drinks plus a coffee station.

As it standard at Marriotts in the United States drinks were with an honor bar system and cost $6-9 each.

The bright point of the club lounge was the attendant who had such a good attitude and was eager to please (sadly I forgot to write down her name but she worked every night). Nonetheless it’s kind of amazing how the quality of club lounges varies based on the brand you’re staying at and where in the world you are.

Boston Marriott Newton Riverbend Bar & Grill

Riverbend Bar & Grill is the Marriott Newton’s all-day dining restaurant located on the lobby level (the fourth floor). Breakfast is served here each morning from 7AM until 11AM and since the club lounge isn’t open for breakfast we could eat here instead. This space had both a lounge and bar area and then deeper in was the restaurant.

We were given breakfast vouchers for the buffet which ordinarily retails for $20 per person. Again it’s a reflection of the low expectations I have of many Marriotts but I appreciated that they gave us the full breakfast. Many Marriotts would try to offer elite members a continental breakfast so that there’s an upcharge for the full buffet.

The breakfast buffet was quite good with fresh fruit yogurt cereal pastries oatmeal smoked salmon and several hot dishes including scrambled eggs breakfast potatoes sausage and more.

Cooked-to-order omelets were also available at no extra cost so I had a veggie omelet each morning.

Boston Marriott Newton Starbucks lobby kiosk

Also on the lobby level the Marriott Newton has a Starbucks kiosk. It has fairly limited hours — it’s open from 6:30AM until 11AM on weekdays and from 7AM until 12PM on weekends. I appreciate when hotels offer easy access to coffee so this was a great option to have whether wanting a hot or iced coffee. I just wish the hours were longer because as an early riser 6:30AM doesn’t really cut it!

There was also a gift shop of sorts next to the coffee kiosk where you could purchase a drink or snack. This was available even when the Starbucks kiosk was closed and they could just ring you up at the front desk.

Boston Marriott Newton gym & pool

The Marriott Newton has both a gym and pool on the second floor and this was right down the hall from us. The gym had a good selection of equipment. I don’t think the hotel was very full during our stay so it was nice to almost always have the gym to ourselves. However this is a 430-room hotel so I imagine when it’s busy this place could get very crowded.

There was also an indoor pool. I’m not much of a pool guy even at a nice resort let alone an indoor pool at a business hotel. I imagine some families appreciate this amenity though especially in winter.

Bottom line

The Marriott Newton is a perfectly decent business hotel if you have a need to be in the area. The hotel is huge and cookie-cutter but that’s kind of what you expect from your average Marriott in the US right?

On the plus side the staff at the hotel were friendly and I appreciate that the hotel’s club lounge is open in the evenings and that elite members receive a full (hot) breakfast in the restaurant in the mornings. That’s how it should be but it’s also an area where some other hotels are much stingier.

I certainly wouldn’t go out of my way to stay here again but if I needed to be in the immediate area I wouldn’t hesitate to return.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhvc3BpdGFsaXR5bmV0Lm9yZy9hbm5vdW5jZW1lbnQvNDEwMDg0MTIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AC Hotels by Marriott Debuts First Hotel in Monterrey Nuevo León,"AC Hotels by Marriott® the design-driven lifestyle brand part of Marriott Bonvoy's portfolio of 30 extraordinary brands today announced the opening of the new AC Hotel by Marriott Monterrey Valle its first hotel in the city of Monterrey.

The 350 rooms are small(ish) at around 17 sqm but seem larger partly because of the floor-to-ceiling windows and partly because of the design which makes the most of the space that there is.

There are hangers along the wall opposite the bed (rather than wardrobes) storage space under the bed (including the laptop-sized safe) and the narrow washbasin in the corridor as you enter the room opposite the separate toilet and good-sized shower. There were a couple of small bottles of water for sale on the basin ($5 each) but if you have a refillable bottle (and you should have!) there is a place to fill it in the basement fitness centre.

The dispensers for toiletries in the shower are on the wall good for the environment if difficult to extract anything from but there is no separate bin for recycling.

There’s a full length mirror by the door the bed is very comfortable and there is a small work desk which folds down from the wall and a collapsible chair (when you arrive it is hanging on the wall – I thought it was the luggage rack at first). I don’t think you’d want to work at the table sitting on that chair for long and if I had done so I would have required medical help to leave the room but the table is a good place to store and charge things and there are also charging points all around the room including both USB docks and US main sockets on both sides of the double bed.

There are limited number of room types with standard rooms being on floors 4-21 and then those with a city view being on 22-32. Note that one side of the building faces towards the Empire State Building and so you want (if available) to have one of those on one of the higher floors though there aren’t many of them.

There are 226 King rooms (17.7 sqm) and then a further five of these are King View; Double rooms are 18 sqm and there are 95 of these with just a further five Double Views. Some rooms allow for four to stay – these are called a Quad Bunk and there are 17 of these. Then there is the Mondo Suite which is 70 sqm without bedrooms (when you would use it as an event space) or can be used with one or two adjoining King bedrooms.

The best rooms are higher up the building and on one side these have outstanding views of the Empire State Building. In fact this view is one of the best I have ever experienced in over 50 visits to New York. Yes you can stay south of Central Park but the price for that view would be four times as much.

I spent a lot of time taking pictures of the view not least when a praying mantis came to visit and watch me through the window. I wasted an hour or so videoing it but to be fair it seemed just as interested in me. It was also fun watching it climb up and down the Empire State Building though instead of Godzilla it was more like the insect in the Edgar Allen Poe story The Sphinx (interestingly written at a time of contagion – cholera – and set just north of New Rok in a house overlooking the Hudson.)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS9ob3ctdG8tZWFybi1taWxlcy11bml0ZWQtYWlybGluZXMtbWlsZWFnZXBsdXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Earn miles with the United Airlines MileagePlus program,"United MileagePlus miles may not be as valuable as they once were but they have their place.

You can use them for United Airlines and Star Alliance partner awards with no fuel surcharges saving you hundreds of dollars per ticket. Further the airline frequently offers low-cost domestic award tickets and reasonable pricing on long-haul international business class tickets operated by United.

It's also easy to redeem United MileagePlus miles. United's website is well designed and shows nearly all available Star Alliance flights online. Because of this it's an excellent program for points and miles newcomers who want to earn and redeem miles quickly.

In this article I'll show you the best ways to earn United miles — many of which don't require stepping on a plane.

Earn United miles by flying

As you'd expect you can earn United miles by flying with the carrier or one of its partners. However how you earn United miles depends on several factors including the airline operating the flight how you booked the flight and your fare class. Let's take a closer look.

Flying on United

Over the years United has changed how you earn miles when flying on United-operated flights. Instead of earning based on miles flown you now earn MileagePlus miles based on your ticket's base price (minus taxes). You'll also earn additional miles if you have MileagePlus elite status — the higher your status the more miles you earn.

Here's how many miles you'll earn per dollar spent based on your level of status:

General member : 5 miles.

: 5 miles. Premier Silver : 7 miles.

: 7 miles. Premier Gold : 8 miles.

: 8 miles. Premier Platinum : 9 miles.

: 9 miles. Premier 1K: 11 miles.

You may unsubscribe at any time.

Here's an example of how this works. If you buy a one-way United ticket from Chicago to Des Moines with a base fare of $210 and $30 in taxes you'll earn 1050 miles as a MileagePlus traveler without status. However if you're a top-tier Premier 1K member that earning jumps to 2310 miles.

Note that these earning rates apply even if you're booked into United's basic economy fare class.

United flights also count toward earning Premier status though the carrier changed this process significantly for the 2020 qualification year. Instead of earning status based on miles flown you'll now earn it based on how many Premier qualifying points (PQP) you earn or a combination of how many PQPs you earn and Premier qualifying flights (PQF) you take.

PQP is determined based on how much you spend on flights and PQF is based on the number of segments flown on United or its partner airlines.

Flying Star Alliance partners

You can earn United MileagePlus miles when flying any of United's Star Alliance or non-alliance partners — but it can be a little tricky.

Suppose you book a partner flight through United with a United Airlines ticket number. In that case you'll earn miles the same as if you were flying on a United-operated flight: based on the base fare of your ticket and your elite status level (as detailed above). However if you book the ticket on a partner ticket stock you'll earn miles based on your fare class and how long your flight is.

Fares are usually booked on a partner ticket stock when you book directly through the partner airline. For example if you're flying on Lufthansa and booked on Lufthansa.com you're almost definitely booked on Lufthansa ticket stock. If you book through an online travel agency (OTA) like Orbitz or a credit card portal like the Chase Ultimate Rewards Travel Portal or Amex Travel these methods may book you on partner ticket stock.

You can verify that a ticket was booked on partner ticket stock by looking at the e-ticket issued after booking. If the ticket number starts with 016 it's on United ticket stock.

The mileage earning rates vary from airline to airline. So check your booking class by looking at your ticket or calling the airline. Then head over to United's list of partner airlines click on your airline and find the corresponding fare class on that list.

To figure out how many miles you'll earn just multiply the mileage flown by the percentage in the ""Award mile earnings"" column. As you'd expect fares booked in premium cabins generally earn more miles than economy tickets.

United elite status on partner flights

One of the best ways to qualify for United Premier status is by flying on long-haul premium-cabin Star Alliance tickets. As mentioned you generally earn around 1 PQP per dollar spent on United flights. However on partner airlines you can sometimes earn over 3 PQPs for each dollar you spend.

Refer to our guide on earning PQPs with partner flights to learn how flying on United's partners can help you qualify for United status. Just keep in mind that United requires at least four paid flights per year to be on United or United Express to qualify for any status level.

On tickets ticketed and operated by Air Canada ANA Austrian Azul Brussels Lufthansa and SWISS Premier members earn bonus miles (but no bonus PQPs):

Premier Silver : 25% bonus.

: 25% bonus. Premier Gold: 50% bonus.

50% bonus. Premier Platinum : 75% bonus.

: 75% bonus. Premier 1K: 100% bonus.

Let's unpack this by looking at a real example on a Lufthansa ticketed and operated flight. We'll start with United's earning chart for Lufthansa.

(Screenshot from united.com)

Let's say you're flying from New York to Munich. Your flight is booked in Z-fare business class meaning that you'd earn 150% of the mileage flown as per the earning chart above. The flight from New York to Munich clocks in at 4038 miles so you'd earn 6057 redeemable miles. The math looks like this: 4038 * 1.50 = 6057.

As noted above a United Premier Gold member would earn an additional 50% of miles flown giving them 9086 miles for this example. Here's the math: (4038 * 1.50) * 1.50 = 9085.5 which would round up to 9086.

To determine the distance between two airports use GCmap.com and input your departure and arrival airport codes. It'll then tell you how far apart the two are in miles.

Transfer Ultimate Rewards points to United

Chase Ultimate Rewards is a popular transferable point currency. Although there are many ways to redeem Ultimate Rewards points the most lucrative is to transfer points to one of Chase's airline or hotel transfer partners.

United is one of Chase's airline transfer partners. So you can transfer Chase points to United at a 1:1 ratio effectively turning 1000 Ultimate Rewards points into 1000 United miles. Ultimate Rewards has various other transfer partners including Air France-KLM Flying Blue British Airways Avios and World of Hyatt. This added flexibility is why we recommend earning Ultimate Rewards points over United miles.

Chase's suite of Ultimate Rewards-earning credit cards may be a better fit for your wallet. They have broader bonus categories than United's cobranded cards. So even if you only plan on transferring your points to United there's a good chance you'll come out ahead with an Ultimate Rewards card.

Here are some of our favorite Ultimate Rewards-earning credit cards that you may want to add to your wallet.

Chase Sapphire Preferred Card

Annual fee: $95.

Sign-up bonus: Earn 75000 bonus points after you spend $4000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening.

Earning points: The card earns 5 points per dollar on travel purchased through Chase Ultimate Rewards 3 points per dollar on dining (including eligible delivery services takeout and dining out) 3 points per dollar on select streaming services 3 points per dollar on online grocery purchases 2 points per dollar on all other travel and 1 point per dollar on all other purchases.

Card perks: Chase Sapphire Preferred Cardholders get a complimentary DoorDash Dashpass for a minimum of one year. Cardholders also earn 5 points per dollar on Lyft rides through March 2025. Points redeemed through the Ultimate Rewards Travel portal are worth 25% more.

The only downside to getting an Ultimate Rewards credit card over a United cobranded card is the benefits; these cards don't offer free checked bags priority boarding or other United benefits. The Sapphire Reserve does offer other travel benefits like a Priority Pass Select membership. Still United flyers may not find it as valuable as a United Club membership on domestic flights.

Earn United miles with Marriott Bonvoy credit cards

One of the Marriott Bonvoy program's best perks is that you can transfer Marriott points to the program's many airline transfer partners. You can transfer Marriott points to most airline partners at a 3:1 ratio meaning three Marriott points equal one airline mile. Plus you'll get a 5000-mile bonus for every 60000 Marriott points you transfer.

United has a preferred transfer rate due to the airline's RewardsPlus partnership with Marriott. As of the time of writing Marriott points transfer to United MileagePlus at a 3:1.1 ratio. This is in addition to the 5000-mile bonus we mentioned earlier so transferring 60000 Marriott points to United results in 27000 United miles.

Related: When does it make sense to transfer Marriott points to airlines?

To transfer Marriott points to United log into your Marriott Bonvoy account head to the Transfer Points to Miles page and click the Transfer Points button at the center of the screen. Then select United from the airline drop-down menu enter your United MileagePlus number and enter how many points you'd like to transfer.

Earn United miles with travel partners

Beyond airlines United has a handful of other travel partners like cruise lines hotels and rental car companies. Here's a quick look at all some of these partners and how to earn with them.

MileagePlus cruise portal

The MileagePlus cruise portal lets you earn and redeem United miles for booking a cruise.

While the earn and redemption rates vary you can typically get around 0.6 cents per mile. This is significantly less than the 1.4 cents TPG values United miles. So you're better off using the booking portal to earn United miles on your cruise. It's not unusual to earn up to 45000 bonus miles per booking even on low-cost cruises.

Booking hotels with United partners

United has a suite of hotel partners too. You can earn miles based on your hotel stay costs using the United Hotels portal RocketMiles and Points Hound. Each of these online travel agencies (OTAs) lets you book and pay through their website to earn miles on your hotel stays.

Unfortunately you won't earn hotel points or get hotel elite status benefits when booking through these portals. We only recommend booking independent hotels and stays at hotels where you otherwise wouldn't earn rewards. Further always make sure to compare the cost of the stay with booking directly.

United also has a partnership with Villas of Distinction where you can earn 3 miles per dollar on luxury vacation villas.

You can also earn United miles when you book directly with a handful of United's travel hotel partners. Sometimes this means you'll earn based on the price of your hotel stay. Other times it means transferring points from a hotel program to United MileagePlus.

Here's a look at how many miles you can earn:

Hotel Earning rate Accor Live Limitless Points transfer at a 2000:1000 ratio. Choice Privileges Earn 250 miles per stay. Points transfer at a 5000:1000 ratio. World of Hyatt Earn 500 miles per stay. Points transfer a 2.5:1 ratio. Plus receive a 5000-mile bonus when you convert 50000 points into 20000 miles. Hilton Honors Points transfer at a 10000:1000 ratio. IHG One Rewards Earn up to 2 miles per dollar depending on the property. Points transfer at 10000:2000 ratio. Marriott Bonvoy Earn up to 2 miles per dollar depending on the property. Points transfer at a 3:1.1 ratio with a 5000-mile bonus awarded for every 60000 transferred. You can also visit united.com/MarriottBonus to earn 500 miles on Marriott stays that link with your United flights. Marriott Vacation Club Vacation Club points transfer at a 500:8000 ratio. Up to 40000 miles per member per year. Radisson Rewards Points transfer at a 2000:200 ratio. Shangri-La Gold Circle Earn 500 miles per stay. Points transfer at a 2500:2500 ratio. Wyndham Rewards Earn up to 2 miles per dollar depending on the status level. Points transfer at a 6000:1200 ratio.

Here's what you can expect to earn on an Avis or Budget rental with your status:

: 750 miles. Premier Silver and Gold members : 1000 miles.

: 1000 miles. Premier Platinum and Premier 1K members: 1250 miles.

United packages

United also offers vacation packages where you can book a flight and hotel; flight and car; or a flight hotel and car. Priceline powers this service. When I ran a seven-night flight hotel and car package search from San Francisco to Los Angeles it clocked in at just under $2000 with a compact car from Budget and a standard king room at the Sheraton Gateway Los Angeles Hotel.

By booking a package I'd get two free rental car days and 1000 bonus miles as a limited-time offer.

Earn United miles with other partnerships

While flying and using cobranded credit cards are the primary methods to earn United miles quickly there are also many non-travel-related MileagePlus partners. Here are some of our favorites to help you earn extra United miles.

MileagePlus Shopping

Like most airlines United operates an online shopping portal (MileagePlus Shopping) where you can earn miles for making everyday purchases online. Just sign up for an account and find your merchant on the site before making a purchase.

Starting at this portal rather than the specific retailer's site will give you extra miles on your purchases in addition to the rewards you'll earn using your credit card of choice. This can be a great way to earn 1 2 or even 5 additional miles when shopping online.

In addition MileagePlus Shopping frequently runs holiday and seasonal promotions. Keep an eye out for these promotions and use them to earn even more on your online purchases.

However we recommend using a shopping portal aggregator like Cash Back Monitor to see which portal offers the best return on your purchases.

MileagePlus X app

Download the MileagePlus X app to earn United miles on the go. Simply put you use the app to buy gift cards to select merchants. The gift card is available immediately and you can purchase it in any amount. When making a MileagePlus X purchase you'll earn a select number of miles per dollar.

Participating merchants include major brands like Walmart Staples and Panera Bread. Be sure to give it a look before you make your next purchase. One of the best things about the MileagePlus X app is that miles are awarded instantly in most cases. So if you're ever a few miles away from a redemption buy a gift card to a store or restaurant you frequent.

Best of all primary United Chase Cardmembers earn a 25% bonus on miles earned from MileagePlus on eGift Card purchases.

United MileagePlus Dining

Like most other domestic carriers United has a dining rewards program that's part of Rewards Network: MileagePlus Dining.

In short this is a shopping portal for eating out. Just sign up for an account and link the credit cards you use for dining. You'll earn up to 5 miles per dollar when you swipe a linked card at participating restaurants. These earnings are in addition to what you earn on the credit card you use so be sure to use one that offers a category bonus on dining purchases.

To maximize your earnings with MileagePlus Dining you'll want to get select status and try to snag VIP status. Becoming a select member is easy: sign up for the program and enable email alerts. Doing so will get you an earning rate of 3 miles per dollar.

Once you've made 11 dining purchases in twelve months you'll reach VIP status and start taking home 5 miles per dollar. If you don't opt in to receive emails from MileagePlus Dining you're considered a basic member (and will only earn 1 mile per $2 spent).

United's PerksPlus program lets businesses earn rewards on employee travel. Sign up for the program and you'll be issued a PerksPlus number that you your employees and your travel agent can add to work-sponsored travel operated by United All Nippon Airways (ANA) Austrian Airlines Brussels Airlines Lufthansa and SWISS. Your business will earn PerksPlus points based on the cost of a ticket.

You can redeem these points for United elite status for employees award travel certificates United Club memberships and more. You can use these to reduce employee travel costs or enhance your travel experience. PerksPlus points are earned in addition to the miles an employee earns when traveling so both parties win. Check out United's PerksPlus website to learn more and enroll.

Buy United miles

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

If you need United miles in a pinch you can opt to buy them from the airline. Unfortunately however it's usually quite expensive to do this. The standard price for United miles is well over 2 cents per mile which is rarely worth it unless you need to buy a small number of miles to top up for an award.

United frequently runs mileage sales that drop the cost of miles considerably. Even so you should only buy miles when you have a specific redemption in mind and have already found bookable award space. Be sure to compare the cost of an award ticket against the cash fare before booking with miles.

Bottom line

As you can see there are many ways you can earn United miles. The most robust approach is to use the above methods in tandem. If you use all of the discussed earning methods at once you'll unlock some terrific earning rates that will quickly get you within striking distance of your next award trip.

We recommend starting with a credit card to earn United miles on everyday purchases and then moving on to the other methods discussed. This will ensure you're leaving no miles on the table when you book travel and make everyday purchases.

The IRA Chief Executive Officer Alhaj Kaddunabbi Ibrahim Lubega told journalists in Kampala that the insurance question around the project was already resolved.

While there have been global campaigns urging international Insurance firms from insuring the project Lubega revealed that EACOP has been insured by Insurance Consortium for Oil and Gas in Uganda (ICOGU). According to Lubega ICOGU has begun underwriting the oil and gas projects in the Albertine including the pipeline from Uganda to the Port of Tanga in Tanzania.

“We have policies on the pipeline on Tilenga on Kingfisher and this gives us hope moving forward” said Lubega. The revelation by the Authority contradicts a Financial Times report in mid-May indicating that American Insurance Giant Marsh McLennan had bid for and won the contract to find insurers for the East African Crude Oil Pipeline project.

However according to IRA one of the members of the Insurance Consortium for Oil and Gas in Uganda has been selected as the lead underwriter. The Authority’s Manager in charge of Regulation Steven Kaddu Mukasa remained guarded when pressed to reveal the name of the purported lead underwriter from Uganda.

He insisted that the local insurance industry has taken up the risk and that their policies are under review. “And we have seen the participants because it is a consortium we have seen the participants take up the shares that they are to take up” said Mukasa

The global campaign against EACOP has sent banks insurance companies and brokers into secrecy about the oil and gas projects in Uganda. According to Mukasa the leader of the consortium will take care of the underwriting processes and will be in charge of documentation and will share it with other participants in the consortium.

“So I want to confirm that there is a consortium. And the arrangement has been approved by IRA” said Mukasa in March 2019. The Insurance Regulatory Authority 2019 issued the Uganda oil and gas co-insurance consortium guidelines to guide local insurers seeking to take up jobs in the oil and gas sector.

It is anticipated that under a consortium local insurers will be able to pool financial and technical capacity to participate in the underwriting of oil and gas risks. While the local insurers under the consortium may be able to underwrite aspects of the oil and gas projects some of the experienced players in the insurance industry have maintained that there will still be a need to attract foreign insurance firms.

CEO of Minet Uganda Maurice Amogola has previously indicated to URN that the risk being retained locally will be quite small in terms of the value within the oil and gas industry. Other experts have suggested that the limited number of reinsurance firms in Uganda may further limit the share of the risk to be retained in Uganda. According to the Ministry of Finance there were only two local reinsurance firms in Uganda.

There were also plans to allow Kenya Reinsurance in the Uganda market to underwrite the reinsurance business and thereby retain within the region. While Alhaj Kaddunabbi agrees that Uganda has only two reinsurance operators he told journalists that part of the value of the risk will be retained locally.

“The way insurance works you avoid concentration of the risk in any market. In view of the numbers we are looking at in the oil and gas we don’t expect it to concentrate in any country. Many countries are going to be taking part in the premiums that are coming from oil and gas” said Lubega.

He said it is a trend globally that there is no economy that underwrites its big risks like oil and gas. “And this is our role as the regulator to ensure that whoever underwrites only retains what I within his capacity” he added.

He noted that other than two reinsurance firms in Uganda there is also Zepri or PTA Reinsurance Corporation and Africa Reinsurance Corporation which are also taken as local reinsurance firms. “So when you have four reinsurance companies operating peacefully in your market that is a good number” Amogola said.

Unlike co-insurance where several insurance companies come together to issue one single risk reinsurers are typically the insurers of the last resort. The insurance business is based on laws of probability which presupposes that only a fraction of the policies issued would result in claims.

As a result the total sum insured by an insurance company would be several times its net worth. It is based on this same probability of loss that insurance companies fix the insurance premium. The premiums are fixed in such a manner that the total premium collected would be enough to pay for the total claims incurred after providing for expenses.

Twelve months ago they passed the 40 points mark this time it was even more emphatic as they collected 53. And all this without the likes of Jan Frodeno and Lucy Charles-Barclay who had played starring roles in 2021.

Team International had a decent day with four individual wins but it was a shocking afternoon for Team USA as they failed to collect a single victory and took home the ‘Broken Spokes’ trophy as a result.

Collins Cup 2022 Score & Results

Final Match Score: Team Europe 53 Team Internationals 38 Team USA 22.5

There were 12 races each featuring one athlete from Team Europe Team USA and Team Internationals. Six races featuring women and six featuring men – all covering 2km swim 80km bike and an 18km run.

The winner of each race received 3 points with the runner-up getting 2 and the third-place finisher 1.

There was also a bonus points system for the finishing margin between athletes:

1.5 points for six minutes or more

1 point for four minutes

0.5 points for two minutes

Here’s how those 12 matches played out.

Advertisement

Match 1 – Daniela Ryf vs. Sarah True vs. Flora Duffy

Flora Duffy led the swim (with a fastest of the day 25:33) but it was a Daniela Ryf masterclass from that point onwards.

The reigning IRONMAN World Champion completely erased the memory of a difficult day here 12 months ago as she took control on the bike and then stretched her advantage over the all-important six minutes mark on the run.

Olympic and Commonwealth Champion Duffy stayed on well for second and herself claimed a bonus point over Sarah True in third.

Results

Points: Team Europe 6 Team International 3 Team USA 1

Match 2 – Laura Philipp vs. Chelsea Sodaro vs. Ashleigh Gentle

This turned into an absorbing battle between Ashleigh Gentle and Laura Philipp.

Gentle led by over a minute in the water but it all changed on the bike as Philipp moved into the lead and Chelsea Sodaro dropped out of contention.

But Gentle was back in front on the run and worked hard to earn a bonus half point as she extended the lead to 2:33 on the line admitting afterwards: “I left it all out there and am ruined!”

Results

1. Ashleigh Gentle (INT) – 3:30:51

2. Laura Philipp (EUR) – 3:33:24

3. Chelsea Sodaro (USA) – 3:46:23

Points: Team International 5 Team Europe 3.5 Team USA 1

Match 3 – Kat Matthews vs. Skye Moench vs. Paula Findlay

Team International made it two wins out of two to take an early lead at this point as Paula Findlay routed the opposition.

She was first out of the water with Kat Matthews at +20s and Skye Moench +54s.

All three are strong on the bike but Findlay was in a class of her own today and put the issue beyond doubt on two wheels before ramming home the advantage to collect maximum points.

Results

Points: Team International 6 Team Europe 2 Team USA 1

Match 4 – Nicola Spirig vs. Sophie Watts vs. Vittoria Lopes

Anyone who doubted whether triathlon legend Nicola Spirig merited her Captains’ Pick was put firmly in their place in stunning style by the former Olympic Champion on her last international appearance.

It was no surprise to see uber-swimmer Vittoria Lopes first out of the water but Spirig was just 25 seconds behind and Sophie Watts over two minutes back.

And Spirig wasted little time powering to the front on the bike and was out on her own from that point another to collect the full six points. Watt ended her race in the medical tent but was reported to have made a full recovery.

Results

1. Nicola Spirig (EUR) – 3:32:44

2. Vittoria Lopes (INT) – 3:49:17

3. Sophie Watts (USA) – DNF

Points: Team Europe 6 Team International 3.5 Team USA 1

Match 5 – Holly Lawrence vs. Jocelyn McCauley vs. Ellie Salthouse

Another successful Captains’ Pick for Team Europe as wildcard Holly Lawrence notched the win.

There was very little between herself and arch rival Ellie Salthouse on the swim and there were echoes early on the bike of 12 months ago when they were locked together.

Thankfully there was no repeat of Lawrence’s crash this time though she was passed on the bike by Jocelyn McCauley but kept her cool and then asserted for another clear-cut victory.

“Last year I crashed so I was stoked to get maximum points today” said Lawrence afterwards.

Results

1. Holly Lawrence (EUR) – 3:33:10

2. Jocelyn McCauley (USA) – 3:37:43

3. Ellie Salthouse (INT) – 3:46:28

Points: Team Europe 5.5 Team USA 3.5 Team International 1

Match 6 – Anne Haug vs. Jackie Hering vs. Tamara Jewett

Anne Haug rounded off a great six matches on the female side for Europe by notching a hard-fought victory over Tamara Jewett.

The swim in this heat couldn’t have been closer with nothing between the trio from start to finish.

And Jewett produced an excellent display to keep Haug up to her work.

But as Jackie Hering came across the line in third there was no getting away from the fact that in the women’s races Team USA were largely off the pace – with no wins and just one second place to show for their efforts.

Results

1. Anne Haug (EUR) – 3:33:57

2. Tamara Jewett (INT) – 3:35:42

3. Jackie Hering (USA) – 3:39:21

Points: Team Europe 4 Team International 2.5 Team USA 1

Match 7 – Kristian Blummenfelt vs. Ban Kanute vs. Hayden Wilde

A fascinating matchup on paper but reigning Olympic and IRONMAN World Champion Kristian Blummenfelt was a class apart.

He was third after the swim as Kanute led it out but just six seconds separated the trio.

It was close early on the bike too but then ‘Big Blu’ put on the burners deep into the bike. “That’s where I tried to put the hammer down as I knew Hayden was coming from short-course” he explained afterwards.

Wilde stuck on gamely for second but Blummenfelt was already being interviewed by the time he crossed the line.

Results

Points: Team Europe 6 Team International 2.5 Team USA 1

Match 8 – Sam Laidlow vs. Sam Long vs. Lionel Sanders

The match with the most eyes on it after the feisty build up – and how it lived up to expectations!

Sam Laidlow looked to be backing up the trash talk when he led by over three minutes in the swim Sam Long and Lionel Sanders together at +3:17.

But it was always going to be the bike / run when it mattered and that pair had surged past the Frenchman with Long apparently saying “Hope there’s no cramps mate” to him at T2.

Unfortunately for Laidlow it went from bad to worse for him on the run as he was reduced to a walk but that shouldn’t detract from a thrilling finale up front as Sanders and Long produced a sprint finish which just went the way of the Canadian.

“Not bad for a couple of duathletes hey!” said Sanders afterwards in reference to Laidlow’s comments that he’d beat them even without an advantage from the swim.

Meanwhile Laidlow kept going but didn’t cross the line until Gustav Iden in matchup #11. And fair play to him Long and Sanders who all embraced at the finish.

Results

Points: Team International 4.5 Team USA 3.5 Team Europe 1

Match 9 – Magnus Ditlev vs. Rudy Von Berg vs. Max Neumann

Brilliant Challenge Roth winner Magnus Ditlev put down another marker with a demolition job here at the Collins Cup.

It was super close on the swim – “I was really pleased with that” said Ditlev – as Max Neumann held a fractional lead with Rudy Von Berg +4s and Ditlev at +7s.

But the great Dane’s power on the bike is in no doubt and it was a one-horse race from that point to claim maximum points as Von Berg who was a late withdrawal from this event last year took second.

Results

1. Magnus Ditlev (EUR) – 3:13:31

2. Rudy Von Berg (USA) – 3:20:51

3. Max Neumann (INT) – 3:24:52

Points: Team Europe 6 Team USA 3 Team International 1

Match 10 – Patrick Lange vs. Jason West vs. Aaron Royle

A great 22:56 swim from Aaron Royle proved pivotal in this one.

It put him 2:22 ahead of Patrick Lange (hit with a 10 seconds penalty for jumping a fraction early on his bike) and Jason West.

And full of confidence from his recent third at the PTO Canadian Open Royle was able to make it count.

“I knew I had to swim hard and that I did – but I knew there was no looking back from then on. And the feeling of being hunted down can play with your mind especially on the run.”

Results

1. Aaron Royle (INT) – 3:19:42

2. Jason West (USA) – 3:24:34

3. Patrick Lange (EUR) – 3:26:07

Points: Team International 5.5 Team USA 2 Team Europe 1

Match 11 – Gustav Iden vs. Matt Hanson vs. Jackson Laundry

Gustav Iden followed fellow Norwegian Kristian Blummenfelt in breaking the hour mark for the 18km run as his points officially meant Team Europe had retained the Collins Cup.

In truth that had been decided long before but it was another superb display by the reigning 70.3 World Champion.

Matt Hanson was just two seconds behind him after the swim but that soon ballooned while Jackson Laundry was a distant third throughout.

Results

1. Gustav Iden (EUR) – 3:11:32

2. Matt Hanson (USA) – 3:19:19

3. Jackson Laundry (INT) – 3:32:49

Points: Team Europe 6 Team USA 3.5 Team International 1

Match 12 – Daniel Bækkegård vs. Chris Leiferman vs. Braden Currie

Two wins for Norway in the men’s and two for Denmark too as Daniel Bækkegård followed in Magnus Ditlev’s footprints.

He led the swim in 24:05 with Braden Currie at +42s and Chris Leiferman – who endured a difficult day – at +2:49.

Such was the strength of the European team Bækkegård was ‘only’ a Captains’ Pick but he rounded off a dominant triumph for the defending champions in style.

Results

1. Daniel Bækkegård (EUR) – 3:13:52

2. Braden Currie (INT) – 3:21:41

3. Chris Leiferman (USA) – 3:24:42

While the extent of McCormick’s ties to his “home state” are cloudy his ties to another state—the “deep state”—seem far more clear.

Despite his claims to the MAGA movement McCormick is steeped in the nexus of government intelligence and big business that Donald Trump and his acolytes ambiguously refer to as “the deep state.”

Those connections range from colleagues to boards to corporate investments with additional ties to notorious surveillance systems and an internal monitoring project at McCormick’s firm—the legendary hedge fund Bridgewater Associates—that was directly modeled after the Chinese Communist Party’s autocratic surveillance state.

And in the mind of Trump who is McCormick’s most crucial political ally some of those ties would be about as problematic as a MAGA Republican can get—such as for instance former FBI Director James Comey.

Comey it turns out accepted a senior role at Bridgewater the year after McCormick signed on as the fund’s president. As general counsel Comey oversaw an internal security program whose invasive and sometimes demeaning methods of surveillance and interrogation earned him a reputation as Bridgewater’s “in-house inquisitor.”

Aside from Comey the most prominent of McCormick’s “deep state” affiliations is his recent three-year run as a paid trustee of the secretive government-backed investment group In-Q-Tel—quite literally the Central Intelligence Agency’s very own venture capital firm.

McCormick’s role at In-Q-Tel appears on his candidate financial disclosures where he listed the entity’s name as “IQT.” Tax filings from In-Q-Tel which is registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit show that McCormick joined as a trustee in March 2018 and left in 2022 as he pursued his first Senate campaign. He collected an annual $35000 salary logging five hours of work a week according to the tax records and his election bid has since seen hundreds of thousands of dollars in support from executives tied to IQT and its investments.

For McCormick his deep state connections embody the larger political contradictions he’s already been forced to reconcile as a corporate Republican seeking office in the quasi-populist era of Trump.

That tortured balancing act failed two years ago. In the 2022 GOP primary in Pennsylvania the lifelong moderate failed to land Trump’s endorsement—losing that honor and subsequently the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz.

While McCormick got the coveted Trump endorsement this year—though there weren’t any other viable Republicans running in the primary—the dissonance is starker than ever.

Today the MAGA wing of the Republican Party finds itself fully enthralled with conspiracy theories about the intelligence community which Trump and his allies have for years cast as public enemy No. 1. Trump is vowing retribution as a key 2024 campaign plank.

Given that McCormick’s challenge to Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) will be one of the most contentious races of the 2024 cycle the hedge funder turned true MAGA believer may have to work harder than expected to scrub his deep establishment ties in order to appeal to his new base.

A former colleague of McCormick’s at Bridgewater told The Daily Beast that McCormick was “an honorable man” a “stand-up guy” and an “independent” and “brilliant leader.” But the colleague also put his finger on the Trump issue calling it a “sad reality” that McCormick will have to cave to the whims of the former president.

“He knows that if he wins he won’t get to do what he thinks is right” the person said. “He has his own money and he won’t be so susceptible to outside pressures financially. But he’s still going to have to kiss the ring and that’s unfortunate.”

McCormick’s campaign did not respond to detailed questions for this article.

It’s not clear if Trump knew about McCormick’s work with the U.S. intelligence community including the CIA and Comey. But as it turns out the deep state overlaps in myriad ways with McCormick’s 13-year tenure as a top executive at Bridgewater.

In 2010—the year after McCormick left George W. Bush’s Treasury Department to sign on as Bridgewater’s president—Bridgewater hired Comey who would later come to embody the darkest of Trump’s paranoiac accusations about federal agents.

Bridgewater brought Comey on officially as head of security and general counsel. In practice however Comey’s role more closely resembled that of an “in-house inquisitor” over the first iteration of the firm’s oppressive internal employee monitoring program which would later come to be called “The Politburo.”

Before he led the FBI unleashed a bombshell on Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign and got fired by Trump Comey reportedly raked in $7 million per year at Bridgewater. His task was to keep employees in line with the goals of what firm founder Ray Dalio called “radical transparency.” Those efforts included constant surveillance—including recorded meetings and videotaped internal “trials” of employees—with Dalio telling Bridgewater staff that Comey was “like a godfather adjudicating it all.”

The taped meetings were “just the tip of the surveillance ecosystem” at Bridgewater Vanity Fair reported in its profile of Comey’s time with the firm.

“A slew of ex FBI agents staffed the security team. Not only did cameras cover seemingly every inch of the property but they seemed to be watched in real time. Staffers who left their desks even briefly would return to sticky notes left on their computer monitors admonishing them for failing to put up a screen saver” Vanity Fair reported.

Comey would go through employee cellphone and computer records and was apparently so intrusive that he embarrassed one executive into resigning.

But when Comey’s security posse only turned up “little evidence of actual offending behavior to snuff out they created their own” according to Vanity Fair.

In one instance the report said Comey left an executive’s binder clearly labeled and unattended in Bridgewater offices. He then watched as surveillance cameras captured a low-ranking employee discovering the binder and going through it. Comey put the employee on trial and fired him with the approval of Dalio.

Comey however eventually found himself repelled by Dalio’s extremes resigning after two years. (This month Comey happens to be publishing a murder mystery novel that takes place inside a fictionalized version of Bridgewater.)

Dalio however only ramped things up implementing more and more intrusive policies to fully enact his “radical transparency” dogma.

That program it turns out was literally modeled on the Chinese Communist Party’s social surveillance program which Dalio openly admired. He even named the project after the CCP’s own “Politburo” and compared it favorably to “Big Brother” in a 60 Minutes interview.

China of course is another area where McCormick is against the prevailing GOP winds as Bridgewater’s internal culture “reflects aspects of Chinese political ideology” and invested heavily in the region—after McCormick took over as co-CEO in 2017 the fund’s Chinese investments skyrocketed.

The “Politburo” staffed up with officials from the National Security Agency and the CIA. But Bridgewater workers found it “intimidating” and “humiliating” and so intrusive that in 2017 one whistleblower filed a human rights complaint with the state of Connecticut where the fund is headquartered which was covered at the time in The New York Times.

As detailed in a recent book about Dalio titled The Fund the Politburo essentially pitted its employees against each other assigning roles like “auditors” and “overseers” and recording practically every moment of activity—all in pursuit of Dalio’s core “radical transparency” philosophy.

While the system repelled many employees—including Comey and one-time CEO Jon Rubinstein who both left after disagreements with Dalio—McCormick stayed aboard got a promotion and publicly defended Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Rubinstein quit after a “firing squad” meeting that McCormick personally sat in on according to the book where Rubinstein made the case that Dalio’s increasingly authoritarian policies were creating a “climate of fear.” When McCormick one of a handful of senior executives in the room was personally asked if he agreed with Rubinstein’s take he said he did not according to the book.

McCormick has subsequently defended Dalio. In 2020 when McCormick was asked if he took issue with a fundamental contradiction at the core of the monitoring program—“radical transparency” within the company but kept secret from outside scrutiny—he replied that he “doesn’t think it’s inconsistent at all.”

“Ray has always said this: Radical transparency is not total transparency. There are certain things that we’re not transparent about and consciously so. Personnel and salary discussions for example” McCormick said.

Shortly after rising to co-CEO McCormick joined the board at IQT.

The venture capital nonprofit which former CIA Director George Tenet founded in 1999 has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds to hundreds of technology firms and startups some of which are still secret.

Today IQT oversees more than $1 billion in assets and even has its own special-purpose acquisition company. Though the group keeps a low profile IQT maintains a close relationship with government intelligence and security divisions and runs “almost all investment decisions” by the CIA.

Many IQT investments seek to cultivate the private development of surveillance technology that could one day benefit the intelligence community and some of them overlap with both Bridgewater and McCormick.

One of those companies is Palantir a tech firm closely tied to right-wing financier Peter Thiel whose sprawling government work has made it a lightning rod for civil rights controversy—and whose fate was “rescued” by IQT’s investment.

Bridgewater itself helped fund Palantir and incorporated Palantir technology to advance its own investments as well as to help monitor Bridgewater employees in the fund’s pursuit of Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Palantir executives have contributed thousands of dollars to McCormick’s 2024 campaign.

Additionally one of IQT’s current trustees Howard Fox who also served on the board with McCormick has put serious money—more than $150000—behind McCormick’s candidacy in both 2022 and this cycle.

The same is true of other McCormick supporters like the CEO of Tenable an IQT-backed tech firm which announced its public stock offering shortly after McCormick joined the board.

And while it’s true that McCormick brings his own money to the table that hasn’t stopped Bridgewater donors from chipping in. In all Bridgewater employees mostly executives have contributed about $100000 to McCormick’s political aspirations with current president Kyle Delaney throwing $50000 to a 2022 super PAC backing his old colleague.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scoop: McCormick PAC launches big ad buy in Pennsylvania Senate race,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.axios.com/2024/05/08/mccormick-pac-ad-pennsylvania-senate-casey on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcmdhbmZoLm5ldC9vYml0dWFyeS9qb3NoLW1jY29ybWlja9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary | Josh McCormick of Huntington West Virginia,"LEWISBURG WV - Joshua Howard McCormick 38 of Huntington WV formerly of Lewisburg WV passed away May 3 2024 at home.

Bob Casey goes after Dave McCormick on Connecticut residency,"PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — The race between Sen. Bob Casey and his Republican challenger former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick is expected to be one of the most hotly contested elections in the nation.

Casey's name is synonymous with Pennsylvania especially Scranton. But it didn't take Casey long to label McCormick a Connecticut Yankee for living outside the state for many years.

""He hasn't told the truth about where he lives"" Casey said. ""He lives in Connecticut. He hasn't been truthful about that. So you have an out-of-state candidate who's being supported by out-of-state billionaires.""

KDKA-TV's Jon Delano: ""Where do you live?""

McCormick: ""I live in Pennsylvania. I live in Pittsburgh.""

Just before his run for U.S. Senate in 2022 McCormick who is divorced and remarried sold his home in Connecticut bought a home in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill and rented another home in Connecticut.

""My youngest daughter lives with her mother in Connecticut so I periodically go back to Connecticut to see my daughter. Being a good dad is even more important than being a good senator"" McCormick said.

McCormick grew up in Bloomsburg where his father was president of Bloomsburg University. But he also lived outside the state working first for the Bush administration and then as president and CEO of Bridgewater Associates a Connecticut-based multi-billion dollar hedge fund from 2009 to 2022.

McCormick sees the Connecticut residency issue as a distraction from Casey's record.

""When you have the results that Bob Casey has with inflation border crime the war on oil and gas the world falling apart what do you do? Well you try to make it about something that is unrelated in your opponent"" McCormick said.

But Casey says McCormick's long out-of-state residency coupled with his work for a hedge fund associated with multi-millionaires demonstrates who he will represent in the Senate.

""He hadn't voted in Pennsylvania in about 16 years. So I think that's going to be an issue. But I think ultimately it's going to be about whose side you are on"" Casey said.

Casey sees himself as representing hard-working middle-class Pennsylvanians while McCormick argues that Casey has failed to deliver any results.

McCormick criticizes Casey for supporting President Biden's infrastructure bill CHIPS and Science Act the Inflation Reduction Act and other bills.

""Bob Casey has been a 98% vote for Joe Biden"" McCormick said.

Casey sees himself as a soft-spoken doer who gets things done for this part of Pennsylvania.

""The bridge investment alone is about a quarter of a billion dollars just for bridges"" Casey said. ""But there's investments for K-12 education investments for communities all across the board whether it was in the infrastructure bill the American Rescue legislation or otherwise. So we've been able to get resources to communities to try to lift them up but we still have work to do so I want to keep delivering.""

The two candidates disagree on other issues as well like abortion. Casey who is personally pro-life supports the Women's Health Protection Act to codify abortion rights nationwide while McCormick opposes abortion with limited exceptions and opposes all federal legislation on the subject.

""Our states should decide"" McCormick said. ""Pennsylvania should decide as it has. My belief is that we shouldn't have bans. We shouldn't have national legislation.""

Casey says McCormick's work at the hedge fund to promote China will be another issue.

""When China cheats Pennsylvania loses jobs. So he's helped to fuel that rise of China and I think that's going to be a major issue in the campaign"" Casey said.

Delano: ""So you're suggesting he's soft on China?""

Casey: ""I don't think there's any question about it compared to what I've been doing.""

""I've been in business"" McCormick said. ""Yes my business did 2% of its business in China. I know what it's like to negotiate against the Chinese in the government and in business. There is no one better equipped to deal with the challenge of China than me.""

These are just a few of many issues on which Casey and McCormick disagree. Given the millions both campaigns will spend expect to hear a lot more in the months ahead."

(A screenshot from a McDonald's ad.) Chris Matyszczyk/screenshot

It's all about the money.

It's always about the money.

When one of your favorite brands begins to encourage you to use its app there's really only one reason -- to get you to buy its wares more often.

That's where the pandemic suited fast-food brands perfectly. People were stuck at home. They could use apps to get pick-up or delivery. For the likes of McDonald's and Chick-fil-A business did rather well.

You might wonder though what McDonald's is thinking now. I might tell you that it wants you to use its app for well please take a little saunter with me.

The burger chain's UK arm has just released an ad that may boggle minds and even stomachs.

It features a long-distance truck driver. It's a tough job. It requires a lot of sitting. It requires a lot of pining for your loved one who in this case is called Lorraine. It also apparently requires a lot of eating at McDonald's.

Here you see our trucker passes his time by singing -- just one song in fact. ""Coming Home"" by Leon Bridges. He also passes his time stopping at every conceivable McDonald's he can.

""Why would he do that?"" you might ask. Perhaps that's all that's open on his travels. Perhaps it's the sheer convenience and value that seduces him.

Or perhaps it's the fact that he feels an urgent need to use his app to rack up as many McDonald's MyRewards points as he can.

One or two people may fear for his health. All he seems to eat is more and more McDonald's. A lot of McDonald's.

The points are mounting at a precipitous pace. Could this truck driver have really eaten every breakfast lunch and dinner at the same place?

Could the people who approved this ad not have wondered that this doesn't set a healthy example for those who'd like to live a long time?

Why is he really doing this? It's here that McDonald's tries to turn on the charm. This truck driver you see has earned enough points to get himself a free McChicken sandwich.

Free always has its attractions. How lovely that he won't have to pay for this delicacy.

Oh but then there's a twist.

The lovely Lorraine is there to meet him at the door of what one presumes is their home. Our hero saunters into the kitchen clutching a gift for her behind his back.

You're already there aren't you? It's the McChicken Sandwich.

Also: McDonald's and Chick-fil-A both have a big problem. Only one has a solution

Yes our hero loves his Lorraine so much that he's stuffed his face for days and days just so that he can avoid paying $1.29 -- at least in the US -- for a gift to impress his Lorraine.

Oh it's all played as if this is something of a joke.

But how many on watching this ad might consider a few things?

One a fast-food brand encouraging its customers to constantly fill their gullets with rather unhealthy food may not be acting entirely responsible.

Two love may not revolve around money but there's still something entirely unloving about bringing a now-cold McChicken Sandwich back to your lover in order to inculcate your questionable eating habits into her life and tell her how much you care.

And three Lorraine is this really the right man for you?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluYy5jb20vYmlsbC1tdXJwaHktanIvYWZ0ZXItNTUteWVhcnMtbWNkb25hbGRzLWp1c3RtYWRlLWEtbG9uZy1hd2FpdGVkLWFubm91bmNlbWVudC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After 55 Years McDonald's Just Made a Long-Awaited Announcement,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/after-55-years-mcdonalds-justmade-a-long-awaited-announcement.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluYy5jb20vYmlsbC1tdXJwaHktanIvYWZ0ZXItNTUteWVhcnMtbWNkb25hbGRzLWp1c3RtYWRlLWEtbG9uZy1hd2FpdGVkLWFubm91bmNlbWVudC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS9mb29kLzIwMjIvMDgvMjEvbWNkb25hbGRzLWNoaWNrZW4tYmlnLW1hYy11bml0ZWQtc3RhdGVzLzc4NjA3ODIwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's to test run chicken Big Mac in the US after popular UK trial,"The Big Mac is one of McDonald's signature items but the fast food chain is putting a new twist on it – originating all the way from the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.

McDonald's will be testing a chicken Big Mac in select Miami-area locations later this month the company confirmed to USA TODAY. The menu item was first introduced in the United Kingdom earlier this year and met with much positive feedback selling out less than two weeks.

""We're always looking to give our fans more ways to enjoy the classic menu items they know and love"" McDonald's said in a statement. ""Made with two crispy tempura chicken patties our iconic Big Mac sauce and topped off with pickles shredded lettuce and American cheese this sandwich brings some of our fans' favorite flavors together for the perfect bite.""

McDonald's said their CEO Chris Kempczinski said in a recent earnings call that chicken ""continues to be a significant opportunity for us"" and remains a priority for the company.

""We've got some great global equities already in our McNuggets and with McChicken but we also have some equities in McCrispy and McSpicy that we think we've got an opportunity to do more with globally"" Kempczinski said.

McDonald's didn't say if the chicken Big Mac will be available nationwide but hinted the test run in Florida could springboard it to a menu near you.

""While not everything we test makes it on our U.S. menus we’ll use this time to gather feedback from both customers and restaurant crew as we consider opportunities to offer more delicious options in the future"" the company said.

CHICAGO (WLS) -- Chicago police say a 6-year-old boy was sexually abused in a bathroom at the McDonald's flagship restaurant on Clark Street in River North.

Police say the young boy was in the bathroom Saturday just before 6 p.m. when the suspect went into a stall and sexually abused him.

The suspect allegedly fought back when security tried to intervene but was able to be detained and later arrested when police showed up.

Charges are pending.

The boy was taken to Lurie Children's Hospital.

Area Three Detectives are investigating.

However fans of McDonald’s don’t have to worry because the popular fast-food restaurant will be returning to the same site in Mentor in the near future.

According to City of Mentor Planning Director Kathy Mitchell demolition of the building began Aug.12 and the building was gone by Aug 16.

The original McDonald’s building was constructed in 1983. The current owner is building a new McDonald’s restaurant in its place with the design of the building to be updated to reflect the brand’s current model while complimenting the style and character of recently approved buildings within the Reynolds Road corridor.

The site circulation will also be improved with expanded drive-thru lanes and safer access onto and off the site.

“These site and building upgrades are a definite enhancement to this busy corridor” Mitchell said.

Cost associated with the permit is $2.5 million and the contractor is listed as Fred Olivieri Construction Company.

Mentor Economic Director Kevin Malecek said the busy corridor on Reynolds Road is a popular area for businesses to invest in such as new facilities for Optima Dermatology and Rainforest Car Wash. Several McDonald’s have undergone similar updates such as ones in Willoughby Hills and Mayfield and the new facility on Reynolds Road will certainly add to the attraction of an already heavily-trafficked area he said.

“It’s a popular landing spot for businesses and the ones that are established are helping bring up the vibrancy and are thinking of staying current with their customers in mind” Malecek said. “I think you will see continuous reinvestment and redevelopment along the corridor.”

Malecek said there are more than 175 restaurants in Mentor ranging from fast food to high end establishments and from national chains to locally owned businesses. He added the city has shown it will support additional restaurants coming in recently such as Bibibop."

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTbSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWFsdGguZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,"Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals Subscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.

At the time of his ban from Meta's platforms Tate had amassed over 4.7 million followers on Instagram.

Bans from Facebook and Instagram mean the former kickboxer turned multimillionaire influencer is now de-platformed from the big three social media platforms. He was banned from Twitter in 2016 after stating women should ""bear responsibility"" for being sexually assaulted. Meta banned Tate for violating its policies on “dangerous organizations and individuals"" The Guardian confirmed.

Tate's videos — which are cartoonishly misogynistic —amassed a large amount of attention this summer due to their controversial and over-the-top nature and their ubiquity. Tate's questionable source of income appears to involve inducing customers at his ""Hustler's University"" business to create social media accounts clipping short vignettes from Tate's podcast and interview appearances and dispersing them to as many people as possible.

What appeared to have been Tate's official Tiktok account has been banned for quite some time now but his various fan accounts on TikTok have hundreds of thousands of followers. The #andrewtate hashtag alone has 13.4 billion views on Tiktok. A spokesperson with Tiktok told The Guardian that the platform has been ""removing violative videos and accounts for weeks and welcome[s] the news that other platforms are also taking action against this individual.""

In a statement to The Guardian Tate told the outlet that most of his videos are parody and that ""Internet sensationalism has purported the idea that I'm anti-women when nothing could be further from the truth."" Tate appeared with popular Twitch streamer Adin Ross and spoke about the claims further. He stated that everything said about him was a false narrative created by people who dislike him.

""What they've done is found all the little clips across six years of content a total of three or four minutes and are trying to make it look like I'm out there trying to hate on women when I'm the one out here donating to women trying to prove that my influence has an effect and that I need to be very very careful with it"" Tate said on Ross' stream. ""It's a truly false narrative."" Tate has so far been unapologetic about the many controversial statements that he claims are being used to construct this supposedly false narrative.

The UK advocacy group Hope Not Hate told the BBC that Tate is a “dangerous misogynist” and called on more social media companies to deplatform him. Joe Mulhall director of research at the group told the BBC that ""Mr. Tate poses a genuine threat to young men radicalizing them towards extremism misogyny racism and homophobia.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzIwL2FuZHJldy10YXRlLXNvY2lhbC1tZWRpYS1pbmZsdWVuY2VyLWZvcm1lci1yZWFsaXR5LXR2LXN0YXItYmFubmVkLWZyb20tZmFjZWJvb2staW5zdGFncmFtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Andrew Tate - social media influencer former reality TV star - banned from Facebook Instagram,"Controversial social media influencer and former reality TV star Andrew Tate was banned from Meta platforms Facebook and Instagram on Friday.

Tate 35 was banned due to violations of Meta’s policies on dangerous organizations and individuals according to the BBC. Before he was banned Tate had over 4.7 million followers on his Instagram account @cobratate.

The former kickboxing champion discussed the ban with popular Twitch streamer Adin Ross.

“I’m quite understanding of their position” Tate said. “It’s not a big loss for me. It’s not something I use too often.”

“I’m kind of relieved because the real world is such a beautiful place. The less things on my phone and it’s just one less thing I have to look at. I’ll just get in my supercar and go for a drive.”

Tate told the Twitch streamer he doesn’t know why he was banned from the Meta platforms. But went on to say that he has “good people on the case” and that he trusts “Due process.”

Tate’s first rise into the limelight came when he appeared as a contestant on the UK version of “Big Brother” in 2016.

He was kicked from the show after a video emerged of him allegedly attacking a woman. Tate’s stance on the video is that it was edited and “a total lie trying to make me look bad” as reported by the BBC.

In 2017 during the height of the Harvey Weinstein allegations Tate was suspended by Twitter for saying that women should “bear responsibility” for being sexually assaulted.

Tate’s popularity grew amid outlandish comments about women’s intelligence saying they’re “intrinsically lazy” and is a strong proponent that men should have “authority” over a woman when in a relationship.

Tate has a Youtube channel under the name “TateSpeech”. TateSpeech/YouTube

CBS News reported that an account associated with Tate was permanently banned from TikTok as the company ramps up its efforts to remove videos of Tate’s hateful ideologies. His videos are being uploaded by various accounts not directly associated with Tate with the #andrewtate having more than 13 billion views on TikTok.

Dear Gridlock Sam

The exit off the Long Island Expressway at Van Dam St. has people constantly pushing their way into the people waiting in the proper lanes. They even get all the way up to the exit and intimidate to get in. Something has to be done; I think there should be a traffic camera at these exits to take photos and issue tickets similar to red light cameras and speed and bus lane cameras.

Joe

Dear Joe

I hate “cheaters.” That’s what I call drivers who go to the very end of a long line of cars and cross over the channelization (hatched lines). The Van Dam exit is one of the worst locations in the city because it is the last exit before the toll at the Queens Midtown Tunnel.

Once congestion pricing goes into effect there will no longer be an incentive for drivers to hop off at Van Dam unless they have a local destination. Until then I’ve asked NYPD to enforce the rule but even then I don’t see the problem eliminated. The legislation for cameras doesn’t extend to crossing channelization but maybe it should. Readers?

It launches on February 1 2022 and we interviewed an MGM representative to get all the details. Let’s take a look.

New MGM Rewards Program Details

According to an MGM official the M life program will be rebranded as MGM Rewards because guests often failed to make the connection between “M life” and “MGM.” This is far from the most exciting news however as the revamped program will be offering far more enticing benefits to compete with fellow casino loyalty programs.

The 5 existing tiers of status will remain the same:

Sapphire (Up to 19999 Tier Credits)

(Up to 19999 Tier Credits) Pearl (20000 Tier Credits)

(20000 Tier Credits) Gold (75000 Tier Credits)

(75000 Tier Credits) Platinum (200000 Tier Credits)

(200000 Tier Credits) Noir (Invitation only)

However new perks will be launching to help bring the MGM Rewards program into a far more competitive alignment with programs such as Caesars Rewards.

In addition to elite status updates MGM Rewards will change the way you earn points. Specifically from February 1 2022 onward nearly all gaming and non-gaming spending will earn you MGM Rewards Points. Previously these points were limited to gaming and co-branded credit card spend.

However bear in mind that along with these changes MGM Rewards will be slashing the ability to earn elite status for non-gaming spend. When this new program launches members will earn just 4 Tier Credits per non-gaming dollar spent versus the current 25 Tier Credits per dollar they currently earn with M life.

Pearl Elite Status Changes

As the lowest earned status Pearl hasn’t historically awarded its members much. The new program offers some exciting changes however:

No expiration of points

Free concert tickets

This is in addition to existing benefits such as free self-parking and discounted room rates.

Hot Tip: Are you active duty or a veteran? Enjoy free Pearl status for life with MGM’s MVP M life Rewards Card.

Gold Elite Status Changes

Most of us here probably have M life’s Gold elite status thanks to its reciprocal partnership with World of Hyatt (and if you don’t you should). Although free valet parking has been nice the lack of waived resort fees as offered to Caesars Diamond members has driven away business. Clearly MGM has noticed this with these revised benefits:

Waived resort fees on up to 2 rooms

$100 celebration dinner (for eligible members)

Tier appreciation events

Although room rates in Las Vegas can be ridiculously cheap the $45+/night resort fee stacked on stop can quickly turn a cheap weekend getaway into a costly event. MGM has done one better than Caesars here and doubled the number of rooms you can get with waived resort fees — meaning you and all your friends can head out and party for less than $25 per night.

And although at first blush the celebration dinner looks like it’s there to compete with Caesars’ be aware that the $100 credit is only for those who’ve acquired the actual Tier Credits; those who’ve matched over do not qualify.

Platinum Elite Status Changes

$200 celebration dinner (for eligible members)

$600 air travel credit to Las Vegas (for eligible members)

Advanced suite upgrades (up to 3 nights)

4 p.m. late checkout

NOIR Elite Status Changes

$500 celebration dinner (for eligible members)

$1200 air travel credit to Las Vegas (for eligible members)

Keep in mind that the full breakdown of benefits hasn’t been released. MGM will be giving a broader breakdown when the MGM Rewards program launches on February 1 2022.

What About World of Hyatt?

According to the MGM representative to whom we spoke “Members can continue to redeem World of Hyatt points for stays at all Las Vegas MGM Rewards destinations and MGM Rewards will continue to match World of Hyatt tier status under the new program as we do today with M life Rewards.”

This is excellent news for World of Hyatt loyalists and not just those who want to visit Vegas. Why? Because the reciprocal partnership with MGM means that you’ll earn elite night credits on all MGM Resorts stays. At ~$65 per night this was still a decent and somewhat cheap way to earn World of Hyatt’s top-tier elite status.

But with resort fees waived — well Vegas has just become the easiest and cheapest way to earn Globalist status.

Room rates in Las Vegas tend to fluctuate up and down pretty drastically on weekend versus non-weekend stays. The $22 rate above for example was on a Thursday night. But let’s say for the sake of argument that you were able to find yourself enough eligible weeknights at a $22 rate to earn yourself Globalist status.

How much would that take?

Earning World of Hyatt Globalist status takes 60 nights 50000 bonus points or 20 meetings hosted. In this case paying $22 per night would mean it’ll cost you just $1320 to earn top-tier status. That’s ridiculously cheap especially for a status that grants you benefits such as complimentary breakfast suite upgrades and 4 p.m. checkout.

Final Thoughts

Look there’s no doubt that MGM has slashed the ability to earn elite status by dropping your earn rate on non-gaming spend from 25 Tier Credits down to 4 Tier Credits per dollar. However for those of us who rely on matches and partnerships to earn elite status the revamped MGM Rewards program is a huge boon.

This is especially true thanks to the industry-leading waived resort fees benefit which means that not only will Vegas (and elsewhere) be cheap for you World of Hyatt’s Globalist elite status just became much easier to reach.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL2xhcy12ZWdhcy1zdHJpcC1iaWctY2hhbmdlcy1uZXctY2FzaW5vLW5iYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Could Change the Las Vegas Strip Forever (In a Good Way),ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/las-vegas-strip-big-changes-new-casino-nba on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL2xhcy12ZWdhcy1zdHJpcC1iaWctY2hhbmdlcy1uZXctY2FzaW5vLW5iYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA4LzIxL2xhcy12ZWdhcy1pcy10aGUtd29ybGQtZ2FtYmxpbmctY2FwaXRhbC1hZ2Fpbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Las Vegas Is the World Gambling Capital Again,"Las Vegas is on track for a record year and is once again the king of gambling.

Under the agreement MGM China will inject MOP$4.8 billion (US$594 million) into MGM Grand Paradise – which will tender for a new gaming concession – in order to meet a requirement under Macau’s revised gaming law for concessionaires to maintain a minimum capital requirement of MOP$5 billion (US$618 million).

MGM Grand Paradise will then issue and allot 4070000 Class A Subscribed Shares and 730000 Class B Subscribed Shares to MGM China which will in turn transfer those 730000 Class B Subscribed Shares to Ms Ho for MOP$1.

Upon completion of the share issue and transfer MGM China will hold 84.6% of the voting rights in MGM Grand Paradise with Ms Ho holding 15.0% and parent firm MGM Resorts International 0.4%.

This would bring the company in line with another stipulation of the new gaming law which provides that management of concessionaires shall be delegated to a Managing Director who “shall be a permanent resident of the Macau SAR and shall hold at least 15% of the capital stock of the concessionaire.”

In a Sunday filing MGM China said “Upon the successful outcome of the Tender additional duties and obligations will be imposed on Ms Pansy Ho pursuant to the delegation of authority to her as Managing Director from the MGM Grand Paradise’s board of directors.

“It is conditionally agreed that Ms Pansy Ho will serve as the Managing Director of MGM Grand Paradise for the same term as the Concession Term in consideration of the remuneration and incentive payments set out in the Services Agreement entered into between Ms Pansy Ho and MGM Grand Paradise.”

Ho who currently holds a 22.49% stake in MGM China will be remunerated for taking on the Managing Director role to the tune of US$8 million per year as well as incentive payments paid on a sliding scale depending on the company’s Adjusted EBITDA earnings each year to a maximum of US$95 million over the 10-year concession period.

The company said it expects the final award of new gaming concessions will be announced by the Macau government in November."

In reality the bill will unlikely achieve any of these objectives. Instead it could precipitate important distortions in domestic and international markets that lead to inefficiency waste and political dysfunction.

Congress and the Biden administration’s bid to subsidize the U.S. semiconductor industry has been unnecessary. The industry is healthy  possessing strong capabilities in most supply-chain segments constantly achieving increases in real output and capital expenditures and accounting for 39% of global value-added the largest share among all countries.

Pro-subsidy policymakers and interest groups are quick to point out that the U.S. share of global semiconductor manufacturing has declined from 37% in 1990 to 12% today yet U.S. manufacturing capacity increased from 2 million to 3 million wafers (disc-shaped slices of silicon containing dozens of chips) produced per month between 2000 and 2018 — and close to half of those companies’ wafer capacity is in the United States.

Where the United States is lacking — primarily in the “foundry” segment which concerns third party-owned production facilities or “fabs” that manufacture chips for companies without such in-house capabilities — it can rely on friendly longstanding allies and trading partners including South Korea and Taiwan. Certainly this comes with some risks. But insofar as companies should diversify their operations to hedge against these risks they are large and profitable enough to not need government handouts for these purposes.

Moreover there are sound economic and geopolitical reasons for them to invest in the United States. Indeed Intel TSMC and Samsung confirmed investments in U.S. facilities worth more than $69 billion and began construction before the CHIPS Act was passed in Congress.

Not only are these subsidies unnecessary they could induce distortions in domestic and international markets that lead to decreased production less innovation and political dysfunction at home and abroad. As has been evident whenever U.S. policymakers have experimented with industrial policies beneficiary firms are seldom the most competitive or innovative — and experts are already cautioning that firms like Intel may follow this path.

Moreover broad subsidization of the industry — not addressing real market failures in next-generation semiconductors or gaps in national security-related ones — may lead to underinvestment in bleeding-edge or specialized technologies including crowding out private investments. Subsidies will also likely benefit politically influential firms such as those that lobbied for the CHIPS Act making it less likely that policymakers would pull the plug on investments that prove inefficient or counterproductive.

Worse semiconductor companies worldwide are already anticipating an end to COVID-19-induced shortages as soon as next year. In fact because of lagging demand for consumer electronics and hoarding by chip-consuming firms there could be an oversupply of chips soon.

Given the industry’s proclivity to “ boom and bust ” cycles such a scenario would precipitate reduced revenues and idled production lines. Indeed firms like SK Hynix and Micron Technology are weighing cuts to capital expenditures for 2023.

By funding increased production U.S. subsidies would contribute to this oversupply and its adverse consequences. Moreover given the current global race to subsidize semiconductor production such adverse conditions could pressure countries to protect struggling domestic manufacturers from foreign competition through tariffs. Both foreign and U.S. trade restrictions would impose billions of dollars in costs to consumers and chip-consuming firms through higher prices and shortages — as occurred in the 1980s and 1990s. Trade disputes would likely involve U.S. allies subsidizing their domestic industries thereby proving to be geopolitically costly.

Despite these pitfalls some may consider self-reliance in semiconductor production to be a worthwhile objective. But as a recent Nikkei Asia article noted  the semiconductor supply chain involves a network of suppliers of hundreds of complex components and machines that is impossible to onshore completely.

Insofar as subsidies could boost “domestic” manufacturing such processes would continue relying on foreign inputs — including foreign talent. Thus the more sensible approach Congress should pursue is enacting market-oriented reforms that ensure companies can mobilize resources in response to ever-changing market dynamics and have access to global markets and resources. Such reforms include expanding high-skilled immigration making capital investments fully and immediately tax-deductible negotiating trade agreements and liberalizing military-related trade to include allies with complementary strengths in semiconductor production.

These reforms would do better at enhancing the industry’s dynamism lowering consumer prices and bolstering U.S. national security than broad inefficient and potentially distortive subsidies.

Microsoft tools are innovative flexible and packed with constantly evolving features. However perhaps most importantly of all they’re designed with a strong focus on user experience.

Within the Microsoft Teams ecosystem companies gain access to a flexible environment where they can empower teams provision tools and build the ultimate hybrid workplace. One of the many features within the admin environment is the “Microsoft Teams Device Management” hub.

Here administrators can evaluate monitor provision and manage all kinds of Teams endpoints from an all-in-one ecosystem. You can update firmware from a distance restart tools and monitor diagnostics for your devices and even create and assign profiles to endpoints.

Here’s what you need to know about Microsoft Device Management.

What is Microsoft Teams Device Management?

Microsoft Teams Device Management is an environment within the Teams admin centre where business leaders can maintain control over their endpoints. You can create profiles for devices update firmware check metrics and even purchase new products within the Microsoft Device store.

To manage devices and configuration within Microsoft Teams you’ll need to be assigned to a specific role. Namely you’ll need to be one of the following:

A Teams Device admin

A Teams Service admin

A Microsoft 365 Global admin

Notably the Microsoft Teams Device Management environment allows companies to control and configure any device certified for and enrolled in Teams. This means you’ll need to ensure the endpoints you choose are approved by Teams before you get started. You can find a list of approved devices on the Microsoft website or simply use the Microsoft Device Store to purchase endpoints.

Certified devices can include everything from conference and desk phones to Microsoft Teams Rooms Teams displays and panels. To manage your devices visit the Microsoft Teams admin centre and scroll down to “Teams devices” then click on the device type. Each form of device has its own specific section in the hub.

What Can You Do with Teams Device Management?

The Teams Devices section of the admin centre allows you to remotely view manage and provision Teams technology on Windows devices across your organisation as well as interacting with various other tools. The admin centre makes it simple to see which devices are healthy which need updates and which might be struggling from issues at a glance.

You can also click on individual devices to get information about device health meeting performance and call quality. Just some of the things you can do within the Device Management ecosystem include:

Change settings: In the “Edit Settings” section you can change the configuration of one or more devices remotely.

In the “Edit Settings” section you can change the configuration of one or more devices remotely. Restart devices: You can immediately restart a device or schedule a restart for a specific date or time which can help to initiate firmware updates.

You can immediately restart a device or schedule a restart for a specific date or time which can help to initiate firmware updates. View activity: Selecting a device name and clicking on “Activity” will show you all the meetings the device has been involved in as well as call quality and call duration.

Selecting a device name and clicking on “Activity” will show you all the meetings the device has been involved in as well as call quality and call duration. View meeting details: Selecting “Activity” in the admin centre for a device and clicking on a meeting will show you the details of all the participants in the meeting the type of Teams session individual call quality for each user and how long they were in the call.

Further Controls for Teams Devices

The Teams admin centre also allows users to view and manage phones Teams displays Teams Rooms on Android and panels enrolled in the Teams ecosystem. The information displayed for each device will include its name manufacturer model user status and history. You can also customise your view to show the information most relevant to your needs.

Phones Teams Rooms displays and panels are also automatically enrolled within Microsoft Intune if you’re already signed up for the service. After the endpoint is enrolled device compliance can be confirmed and you can set up additional access policies for the product.

Some of the ways you can manage Teams devices within the Microsoft Teams admin center include:

Changing device information: Edit a device name asset tag and add notes.

Edit a device name asset tag and add notes. Software updates: Select a device and click “Update” to implement a software or firmware update for each device or groups of endpoints.

Select a device and click “Update” to implement a software or firmware update for each device or groups of endpoints. Upgrade Teams Phones: Within the IP phones page you can select one or more Teams phones and “upgrade” them to a Teams display.

Within the IP phones page you can select one or more Teams phones and “upgrade” them to a Teams display. Configure policies: You can select one or more devices and assign configuration policies to them for your teams to follow.

You can select one or more devices and assign configuration policies to them for your teams to follow. Manage tags: Selecting the “Manage Tags” section will allow you to add and remove specific tags from your products.

Selecting the “Manage Tags” section will allow you to add and remove specific tags from your products. Sort through endpoints: Using the “Tag” field you can search for specific devices based on their tags to implement updates or restart the product.

Using the “Tag” field you can search for specific devices based on their tags to implement updates or restart the product. Check history: Under the “history” column you can view update information and diagnostic details over a specific time.

Managing Teams Devices

The Teams Device management section within the Microsoft Teams admin centre is ideal for ensuring companies can get the most out of the endpoints they invest in. You can monitor device health and information at a glance and make changes to products remotely.

Companies can also create configuration profiles in Teams to manage settings and features for each individual device in the organization. You can create and upload configuration profiles to feature settings and features you want to disable or enable and assign configuration profiles within the Teams Devices section.

It’s also possible to check the configuration updates and profiles for each device individually so you can track valuable information about the performance of your products and what they can do.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vaXMtb25lZHJpdmUtc2VjdXJlLWVub3VnaC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Secure Is Microsoft OneDrive?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vaXMtb25lZHJpdmUtc2VjdXJlLWVub3VnaC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2tlZWRhLmNvbS9nYW1pbmctdGVjaC9ob3ctdXNlLW1pY3Jvc29mdC13aGl0ZWJvYXJkLXdpbmRvd3MtMTHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to use Microsoft Whiteboard in Windows 11?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2tlZWRhLmNvbS9nYW1pbmctdGVjaC9ob3ctdXNlLW1pY3Jvc29mdC13aGl0ZWJvYXJkLXdpbmRvd3MtMTHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159BB1811B0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2tlZWRhLmNvbS9nYW1pbmctdGVjaC9ob3ctdXNlLW1pY3Jvc29mdC13aGl0ZWJvYXJkLXdpbmRvd3MtMTHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5lb3dpbi5uZXQvbmV3cy9taWNyb3NvZnQtaXMtYWRkaW5nLWEtYnVuY2gtb2YtbmV3LWZlYXR1cmVzLXRvLXdoaXRlYm9hcmQtc29vbi_SAVpodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZW93aW4ubmV0L2FtcC9taWNyb3NvZnQtaXMtYWRkaW5nLWEtYnVuY2gtb2YtbmV3LWZlYXR1cmVzLXRvLXdoaXRlYm9hcmQtc29vbi8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft is adding a bunch of new features to Whiteboard soon,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5lb3dpbi5uZXQvbmV3cy9taWNyb3NvZnQtaXMtYWRkaW5nLWEtYnVuY2gtb2YtbmV3LWZlYXR1cmVzLXRvLXdoaXRlYm9hcmQtc29vbi_SAVpodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZW93aW4ubmV0L2FtcC9taWNyb3NvZnQtaXMtYWRkaW5nLWEtYnVuY2gtb2YtbmV3LWZlYXR1cmVzLXRvLXdoaXRlYm9hcmQtc29vbi8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159BB1819F0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5lb3dpbi5uZXQvbmV3cy9taWNyb3NvZnQtaXMtYWRkaW5nLWEtYnVuY2gtb2YtbmV3LWZlYXR1cmVzLXRvLXdoaXRlYm9hcmQtc29vbi_SAVpodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZW93aW4ubmV0L2FtcC9taWNyb3NvZnQtaXMtYWRkaW5nLWEtYnVuY2gtb2YtbmV3LWZlYXR1cmVzLXRvLXdoaXRlYm9hcmQtc29vbi8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

WARNING: Under no circumstances should you enter this property. By doing so you risk bodily harm and/or prosecution for trespassing on private property.

Building 23 at the Pilgrim State Hospital was the site of thousands of the crude 45 minute brain surgeries known as a lobotomy. These operations started at the hospital in the 1940's and continued into the 70's. Often times these procedures would leave the individual lifeless.

A lobotomy was the leading treatment for mental illness until 1980's when drugs became available. Once pharmaceuticals reached the public not only did the procedure go away so did the need for such facilities. But what is left behind?

Many say the old site holds a lot of spirit energy perhaps of former patients. There is a graveyard on the property and many buried here are those that once endured a lobotomy. Many of their graves are simply marked with a number and no name.

Bremworth chief executive Greg Smith makes no excuses for championing strong wool carpets over synthetic carpets - even if it means going to court. Photo / Tim Cronshaw

Carpet maker Bremworth isn't wavering from its move to ditch synthetic alternatives for strong wool carpets even though it has come at a cost and a court case.

A legal stoush between Mohawk Industries-owned Godfrey Hirst - with revenues of $US11 billion last year - and Bremworth turned a corner about three weeks ago.

Godfrey Hirst abandoned its claim for damages at a High Court hearing.

It brought the case against Bremworth saying the company's claims around wool carpets being ""better for the environment"" and that a switch from synthetics to all wool carpets was ""changing for good"" were misleading.

Bremworth said this was despite Godfrey Hirst making similar claims including that it took pride in making the most environmentally friendly carpet on the planet.

Bremworth adopted a new strategy in which it shifted to only producing wool carpets in mid-2020.

Chief executive Greg Smith told 300 delegates at a red meat sector conference in Christchurch that it had looked at all the signs to see where consumers were heading and realised it could not compete in the cheap market.

""What did it all mean? It meant dropping around $60 million in revenue to reinvent the business to rebalance the business and grow again.

""That takes courage and that's the No 1 reason I joined Bremworth because there's a ton of businesses with words on the wall but not many places are prepared to take that type of decision and drop that type of income and grow again.""

The father of five children said Bremworth had reinvented itself as a premium design soft flooring and furnishing business with a focus on sustainability and like-minded consumers.

""Not everyone's happy with what we did. Not only did we make the big decision to drop the synthetics we actually made it very clear why we were doing that why we were going good.

""So we were very aggressive in extolling the virtues of strong wool and very aggressive in showing exactly what goes into synthetic carpet and our competitors really didn't like it.

""In fact on my first day at Bremworth they sued us.""

He said that had since changed with damages dropped against them.

""We are still going to court in September 2023 but somehow it's believed that mining subterranean carbon and the byproduct of that being plastic is more sustainable than sheep on hills on grass.

""So we look forward to that and won't shy away from that and that's the challenge we all have in front of us today to be bold to be courageous and make a line in the sand.""

Bremworth had gone from the darling of the sharemarket in the 1980s to the early-2000s with a share price at about $5 and dividends being paid 75 per cent of profits to at its worst 15c.

""That's a tough pill to swallow but the majority of shareholders have stuck with us and we hope to reward them over the coming years with the dividends they've been denied and with the value of the share price going up as a result of our success.""

About $10 million had been spent in marketing over the past two and a half years to talk about why strong wool was ""awesome"".

This was partly financed by the sale of plant land and buildings at Papatoetoe for about $24 million and through profits.

Smith said it would continue to invest more money over the next two years in New Zealand Australia and North America because perceptions of wool were changing to it being more sustainable and natural.

It would continue to make it clear that synthetics were man-made he said.

He said it was important to make profits because meaningful change would not be made otherwise.

It was committed to a $4.9 million sustainability programme and had just released a compostable rug that could be returned to the Earth.

Ultimately it could be upcycled into carpets rugs or other products such as insulation and underlay he said.

Another focus was on energy efficiency and carbon reduction.

Smith said better returns for farmers were important as wool supply was its No 1 threat with strong wool being stored in sheds because of low prices.

Before ""big oil"" came in with synthetic carpet wool was being picked off barbed wire fences at one stage because of its value.

He said wool carpet went on the backfoot when synthetic carpets were marketed as being cheaper and able to be recycled as it was plastic and then became softer with more lustre.

Bremworth entered the synthetic market but could not keep up with sole-business brands.

""But nothing lasts forever and fast forward a decade and consumers are waking up to the fact that plastic-based products are a problem and plastic doesn't go away or break down it only breaks up and as a result it pollutes our waterways our oceans and gets into our food chain.""

Smith said companies he had previously worked for - Icebreaker and Michael Hill Jeweller - were started by business founders prepared to challenge the norm when their industries faced enormous change and challenges.

He said the red meat sector should not be afraid of being bold while it faced challenges with the movement away from farming and real food towards plant-based products.",,,,,,,,,

It was a partnership with a purpose that started in 2020 and has resulted in the collection of 43000 kilos of post-consumer plastic which were then repurposed into upcycled products.

Two years later food manufacturer Mondelēz International and social enterprise The Plastic Flamingo (PLAF) expanded their plastic waste collection and recycling project through a partnership with Megaworld Corporation.

“Sustainability is one of our core thrusts as a company. We are always open to collaborating with organizations which promote the same values. I want to thank Mondelēz International and PLAF for working with us in this milestone project” said Megaworld Lifestyle Malls head Graham Coates.

The project will cover a year-long waste collection drive in five Megaworld Lifestyle Malls—Eastwood Mall Lucky Chinatown Mall McKinley Hall Uptown Bonifacio and Arcovia City.

Consumers who bring in their plastic waste in the five participating malls can get Mondelēz International treats in exchange for helping support proper waste management.

“Our goal is to make snacks with better packaging to make it easier to recycle; to use less packaging by optimizing our pack sizes; and supporting improved systems through the collection of as much plastic as we put into the environment” Mondelez International Country Manager for Corporate and Government Affairs Joseph Fabul said.

L to R: Erica Reyes The Plastic Flamingo Chief Operating Officer Atty. Joseph Fabul Mondelēz International Country Manager for Corporate and Government Affairs Aleli Arcilla Mondelēz International VP and Managing Director and Denisse Malong General Manager for Eastwood City

“We are glad that our malls have become avenues where people can practice a greener lifestyle. At Megaworld we are committed to a culture of environmental consciousness and we continuously look for ways to practice and incorporate it in our township and lifestyle properties” added Coates.

Ideally plastic wastes should end up in the Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) of every barangay for segregation where these would be recycled depending on the type—whether it is a bottle or sachet. However there are still a lot of plastic wastes that are not disposed of properly or when collected which would then be illegally dumped on open land or in bodies of water—something that PLAF seeks to prevent.

“We want to become part of the solution and not the pollution” said PLAF Chief Operating Officer Erica Reyes.

“Our work at PLAF consists of collecting segregating transforming and designing plastic for reuse. We make practical construction materials out of plastic like eco-lumber and eco-boards. This ensures that we are able to recycle plastic and at the same time help reduce the use of precious resources like wood or minerals to make furniture or even shelters” she added.

At present PLAF using plastic wastes creates and sells eco-lumber and eco-boards which can be used to make outdoor furniture bike racks benches and tables among others.

This year Mondelēz continues to strengthen its partnership with PLAF and aims to collect and recycle another 20000 kilos and turn them into usable eco-boards with the help of Megaworld Corporation.

The former Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski recently retired as one of the dominant forces in the history of the NFL. The veteran had amassed enough wealth throughout his career in the form of salary bonuses and his contract deals but it turns out Gronk never touched a single penny from his salaries and NFL earnings. While most players splurge their money on luxuries the 33-year-old was busy saving money for his post-retirement life.

The Arizona product played for a total of 11 seasons in the league. Nine with the Patriots and the remaining two with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. During this entire period he earned nearly $70 million including salary and all the unlocked bonuses. But guess what he never touched it.

All the time he was living on the money that he earned through brand endorsements media and similar deals. Some of his deals included brands like Dunkin’ Donuts Visa T-Mobile Lyft Cheerios Monster Energy Drink Tide and a popular commercial with USAA.

This offseason he was also engaged in anchoring for a kids’ show. His daily expenses were carried out through such earnings. It doesn’t imply that he is a miser but he maintained financial discipline because of his future being football.

Back in 2019 when he announced his retirement from the Patriots Gronk emphasized this agenda of spending the money. He said that he had seen various instances where it takes only a flash of a second to wipe out. Looking back he claims to be confident about having enough wealth to steer him in the next phase of life.

“The way I played it I feel like I’m in a totally safe spot which is great” Gronkowski said. “I’ve seen other players you know not be in a safe spot after they’re done playing and [they] go and spend it all. It’s just great to have that feeling and to have that security that I can go out there trying new adventures [and] put all of my marbles on it but know I’m still safe in the back end” he added.

Gronk always played a prime role in Tom Brady’s chase for a Super Bowl title. Whether it was with the Patriots or the Buccaneers Gronkowski was always by his side. He has four Super Bowl titles and five Pro Bowl selections to his name.

He ranks third in NFL history with 92 career receiving touchdowns behind Antonio Gates’ 116 and Tony Gonzalez’s 111. Taking to social media he thanked all the Buccaneers’ management for the ride and for trusting him throughout the journey.

“The friendships and relationships I have made will last forever and I appreciate every single one of my teammates and coaches for giving everything they had as well” he wrote in his post. The veteran proves he is not only a smart athlete on the football field but is also a genius when it comes to financial management.

""From Brussels to Tokyo to Washington governments are determined to lower their dependence on Beijing"" it underlined.

Explaining it by an example it said It was a difficult balancing act for New Delhi when it decided to abstain from the 15-nation UN security council vote to condemn Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The stance was clear that Delhi didn’t want to alienate Russia an important historical friend which supplies 46% of its military equipment without also antagonizing the U.S. its largest trading partner.

The global brokerage feels India's geographical stance makes economic condition of the country favuorable for a decade.

However it feels the India is yet to realise the kind of industrial transformation that turned countries like China and South Korea into miracle economies by building their manufacturing capabilities.

But this is changing with the government's efforts to actively incentivize large scale manufacturing capacities through production linked incentive (PLI) schemes. ""India’s economic growth was led by services unlike the Asian tigers. PLI schemes have attracted interest across 14 sectors including automobiles solar panels and advanced batteries. Buoyed by the government’s PLI scheme India now is an exporter of mobile phones"" it underlined.

India Vs China

Delhi is also focusing on import substitution in manufacturing to enhance domestic capacity and reduce external dependence. ""As firms everywhere reconfigure supply chains to lessen their reliance on China India has an opportunity to increase its manufacturing helped by a $26 billion subsidy scheme.

As per Morgan Stanely while India has been reducing dependence on China and working on generating employment China struggles with working-age population which has been decreasing .

""Emerging sectors such as aerospace semiconductors and renewables should help increase youth employment. The reform measures are starting to pay off. The “Make in India” initiative encourages both foreign and domestic investment in the manufacturing sector; “Smart Cities” aims to eradicate urban squalor and “Digital India” targets an overhaul of government services with electronic identity digital payments and bank accounts"" it said.

On the contrast China’s economy is slowing down faced with a shrinking workforce industrial overcapacity a floundering property market a mountain of debt and renewed COVID lockdowns.

Speaking on status of the real estate in the two countries it said while investment to GDP ratio in India hovers at 30% China’s has peaked at 45% and a big share of that is real estate investment. The real estate sector accounts for around 29% of GDP in China more than double the ratio in India according to IMF economist Yuanchen Yang.

The working-age population in China is now shrinking which will further erode the demand for housing over the coming years hurting future growth it said.

""The reverse holds in India. After being in doldrums for the past 3 years India’s real estate sector is set to recover. As more of India’s population heads to the cities demand for housing increases"" said the brokerage.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzA4NGIzOTc0LTc2M2YtNGE5Ni04NjZlLTNhY2YyOWE5ZmQ4Y9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Global scope of EU's greenwashing crackdown spooks Wall Street,"Print this page

Global warming is by definition a global problem. But the worldwide scope of the EU’s latest climate change effort — designed to end the practice of describing things as greener than they really are — is provoking alarm on Wall Street.

The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive agreed in principle with little fanfare earlier this summer and due to come into force from next June compels all “large” companies that operate in the EU or have listed securities in the bloc to produce extensive new reports on the effects of their business and of their parent companies on the environment.

“It’s deliberately global in application” said Chris McGarry lawyer at White Case. “That obviously makes sense because we’re talking about global issues.” Andrew Hobbs of EY said the rules had become more extraterritorial than the EU’s original proposals.

For banks such as Morgan Stanley or JPMorgan it means producing reports for businesses that sprawl across dozens of regions and are multiple times the size of their EU-based entities. Some bankers also say it is off-putting for their clients — an Asian company that lists a single debt instrument in the EU will have to produce reams of audited information about its entire business.

“The extraterritoriality is bonkers” a policy expert at a large US institution told the Financial Times. One of his peers at another large US bank described the CSRD as one of the most pressing policy issues on his plate even as the EU fine-tunes hundreds of pages of new capital rules this autumn.

The directive introduces mandatory audited corporate reporting on a vast range of environmental social and governance impacts including greenhouse gas emissions and internal risks and controls. On the environmental side they include metrics such as climate change mitigation strategies pollution and the impact on biodiversity and ecosystems.

That’s a big ask across enormous global businesses banks and their lobbyists say especially when the terminology may not be compatible with other global work and the exact details of what they will have to report at group level haven’t been pinned down yet.

All big companies could make the same arguments but banks feel particularly aggrieved by two elements in the EU’s plans.

One gripe is that the reports must capture the effects of companies themselves and of companies they do business with. Financial services companies’ returns will have to capture the activities of their clients. But financial and non-financial services companies must report on the same day. Banks are arguing that their deadline should be later.

“There is genuine concern around liability (for inaccurate information) particularly in the US . . . around likely litigation if they don’t have the availability and reliability of data they need to be able to make their own disclosures because they can’t get that from their clients” one industry lobbyist said.

The second bank-specific complaint is the imposition of the full whack of rules on foreign companies that list any instrument in the EU’s markets such as a Japanese company issuing a small bond that can only be sold to institutional investors in Paris or Amsterdam or Frankfurt.

The agreement reached in June will continue to grind its way through the Brussels machinery in September when there will be a final plenary vote in the European parliament.

Banks are hoping to get a decent hearing on claims that the most recent draft is unclear — the more optimistic policy experts think the tidying up will mean that companies whose only EU activity is issuing securities get the same reprieve as those offered to small and medium-sized listed businesses. These have been promised obligations that are “proportionate to the capacities and resources of SMEs . . . and relevant to the scale and complexity of their activities”.

But they privately admit that the “ship has sailed” on the extraterritoriality even if they are at odds with the greater European project of creating debt and equity markets as broad and deep as those in the US.

“You’re going to kill off European capital markets like this” the policy expert says. He adds that while there might be an argument for uniform information covering EU-listed equities extending the requirement to all securities will drive companies away.

The policy expert expects companies that only use the EU’s capital markets a little to not use them at all. London may be the beneficiary since it offers a diverse source of funding without incurring the burden of the new rules. “This contradicts the goal for Capital Markets Union (CMU) they know that” the first banker says of the stance Brussels is taking. “There’s not much you can do on that level . . . climate takes supremacy.”

One big force at the center of the two-month equity rally is showing signs of fatigue.It’s the behavior of short sellers whose frantic efforts to unwind bearish wagers created buying that added fuel to the $7 trillion share advance. Evidence is arising now that the process is petering out.Hedge funds that make both bullish and bearish equity bets pretty much stopped purchasing shares to return to lenders this week after previously doing it at the fastest pace in more than two years data from JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s prime broker unit show.Meanwhile Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s hedge-fund clients boosted short positions Wednesday with bets against exchange-traded funds rising the most in more than two months.The shift makes sense from certain technical perspectives. The S&P 500 this week failed to surpass a key long-term trendline its 200-day average. A bunch of potentially bearish events are coming up from central bankers’ annual retreat in Jackson Hole Wyoming to the release of government data on consumer prices and employment.“Hedge funds may view the June-to-August rally as too far too fast and now are licking their chops for another round of downside” said Mike Bailey director of research at wealth management firm FBB Capital Partners. “Tactically markets look a bit feeble at the moment as investors price in good inflation and Fed news.”Since the market’s trough in June computer-driven traders such as trend followers that are mostly active in the futures market have snapped up about $100 billion of equities Morgan Stanley ’s trading unit estimated as many went short during the first-half rout and were caught off guard by the subsequent rebound.There are still a lot of bearish positions outstanding Morgan Stanley’s data show. In the cash market while $50 billion has been covered since June the net amount of added shorts remains elevated sitting at $165 billion this year. Short interest among single stocks stands in the 84th percentile of a one-year range.“The short base in US equities is still not cleaned up though” Morgan Stanley wrote in a note. “With short leverage still high there is more potential for hedge fund short covering.”For now however hedge funds are taking a breather. After spending the past month unwinding bearish trades at a pace last seen at the start of the pandemic bull market JPMorgan’s hedge-fund clients stopped covering this week.At Goldman hedge funds increased short sales while added longs on Wednesday leading to the biggest jump in gross trading activity since the market’s low in mid-June. Though with shorts sales outpacing long buys by a ratio of 3-to-1 net selling hit a three-week high.Shorts unwinding amplified the market upside during the summer lull but all the caution suggests that the downside risk is likely limited and it potentially sets the stage for further gains should things start to improve according to Benjamin Dunn president of Alpha Theory Advisors.“Nobody trusts the rally” Dunn said. “We could be in for a period of weakness but by the same token a lot of people who want to sell have already sold” he added. “That’s been the problem the last several months in this market. It’s nothing but positioning almost nothing fundamental.”"

Hello I'm Oscar. In this trailer I introduce the new features of Season 02 of the Mosaic of China podcast. This includes the PREMIUM version of the show with 10-15 minutes of extra content for every episode.

Listen Here

Transcript

OF: Hello this is Oscar Fuchs. And welcome to Season 2 of the Mosaic of China podcast. Just like Season 1 over the next 30 episodes we will be hearing from a diverse group of 30 people who are making their mark in China. I don't want to ruin any surprises so let me just say that there are some great stories from both Chinese and non-Chinese guests on their way over the coming weeks.

If you're a new listener welcome and here's a quick recap of how the show works. There are three parts to each interview. The first part is a straightforward two-way conversation which starts with the guest introducing an object that in some way describes their life in China. In the second part I ask every guest the same 10 China-related questions all on the theme of their personal experiences tastes and opinions. And the final part is just one extra question where I ask each guest to nominate someone for the next Season of Mosaic of China. And this is how the tiles of this Mosaic will connect and continue to build out in future seasons.

There are also a few things that are new in Season 2 one of them being that this is the first time that we can link new guests back to the people who nominated them from the previous season of the show. So you'll hear how that works in the first episode coming next week. Secondly there will be transcripts available now on https://mosaicofchina.com/transcripts. These have been designed for anyone whose first language isn't English or of course for listeners with hearing impairments or for any English speakers who want to follow the words spoken in Chinese. Thirdly if you'd like to join the community and track all the images alongside each episode on WeChat I've finally been able to rename the WeChat account to ID: mosaicofchina all one word so please add me there from now on and I'll add you to the group. That's consistent now with the accounts that already exist at @mosaicofchina_* on Instagram and @mosaicofchina on Facebook if you would still prefer to follow there.

And finally the biggest difference for Season 2 is that there will now be TWO versions of the show. The normal version will be exactly the same as last season. But I'm also releasing an extended version of the show where there will be an average of 10-20 minutes of extra content for every episode. These will accumulate to up to 10 hours of extra content over the course of the entire season and they can be accessed for the tiny cost of US$2 per month at https://patreon.com/mosaicofchina.com all one word. This is the way I came up with to keep the show free from advertising to still allow you to listen to the series for free while at the same time create a a way to accept donations towards the cost of putting this all together. So if you have anything to spare and you want to help fund this independent project as an early Christmas present please head over to patreon.com/mosaicofchina and you can look forward to getting some great extra content too.

Thanks to all of you for your continued support and I hope to see you back here next week for Episode 1 of the Season.

OAKTON Va. — Fairfax County Public Schools has moved 22 bus stops away from Blake Lane in response to the crash at the Five Oaks Road intersection that killed two Oakton High School students and left a third injured.

Starting Monday Aug. 22 students will wait for the bus on side streets at least 50 feet away from Blake Lane. Once school bus drivers ensure that traffic has stopped they will motion for students to board.

Fairfax County School Board Member Karl Frisch informed his constituents about the changes made following a safety study evaluating school bus safety along the corridor.

Six stops will remain on Blake Lane because the side streets lack the capacity for buses to turn around but no students will have to wait along the roadway moving forward.

In a statement Fairfax County School Board Karl Frisch said “Moving these bus stops will enhance student safety while local and state partners continue working together to mitigate speeding and other traffic concerns in the area.”

New signage has been installed along the 35 mph corridor and the Fairfax County Public Awareness Campaign has put up signs reminding drivers to slow down.

""After that accident people are thinking that speed is a concern"" said Oakton resident Shiva Bucireddy to WUSA9 about the June 7 crash that killed two Oakton High School students and left a third injured. Bucireddy says he has lived in the area for six years and he would like to see more extreme measures in place.

""Yeah speed cameras are a good idea to enforce that everyone is following the speed"" said Bucireddy.

The alleged driver involved in the incident 18-year-old Usman Shahid has been charged with involuntary manslaughter after police said he was driving 81 mph in the 35 mph zone.

Fairfax County has expanded the area where drivers can face $200 fines for speeding along the corridor.

School Board Member Frisch says county Supervisors have directed staff to provide recommendations on the purchase of additional speed deterrent devices. Supervisor Dalia Palchik has also convened a Blake Lane Safety Community Advisory Group.

During the safety meetings some residents have requested Fairfax County Police to park patrol cars along Blake Lane to deter speeding but police say they simply do not have enough officers to do that.

The Nature Conservancy of Canada (NCC’s) Rangeview conservation project is located south of Robsart and is six kilometres west of the Old Man on His Back Prairie and Heritage Conservation Area NCC’s flagship property in the province.

The Rangeview property contains 521 hectares of grasslands and wetlands including seasonal creeks and riparian areas. The property and surrounding areas inhabit many different species of plants and animals including several listed as threatened under Canada’s Species at Risk Act including chestnut-collared longspur common nighthawk ferruginous hawk Sprague’s pipit and swift fox.

Jennifer McKillop Vice-President for NCC’s Saskatchewan Region stated “Looking at the beautiful landscape on the Rangeview property I get a sense of hope that future generations can experience all that nature has to offer. I’m grateful for our donors and partners who help conserve grasslands and the rich biodiversity found in the region. Their support ensures a thriving world for both nature and people.”

In a media release by the NCC it states “The generosity of private donors and the estates of William Gibbs and Margaret Smith helped make this long-lasting impact for nature. These donations help NCC obtain match funding from the federal government and other partners. The Government of Canada is a major funding contributor through the Natural Heritage Conservation Program part of Canada’s Nature Fund. The project was also significantly supported by funds from The MapleCross Fund The Mosaic Company TC Energy U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Walmart Canada.”

Conserving grasslands provides solutions to counter the challenges of rapid biodiversity loss and the impacts of climate change state the NCC.

“The twin crises of climate change and biodiversity loss are two sides of the same coin and we must tackle them together. By working with partners like the Nature Conservancy of Canada individual and corporate donors we are helping to protect the natural environment in Saskatchewan and across the country. Through programs like the Natural Heritage Conservation Program our Government is helping progress toward our goal of conserving a quarter of lands and oceans in Canada by 2025” stated The Honourable Steven Guilbeault Minister of Environment and Climate Change.

“grasslands store carbon filter our water and help prevent flooding and droughts. In the past two years alone NCC has influenced the protection of more than 1 million hectares (almost twice the size of Banff National Park) coast to coast to coast” stated the release.

The NCC plans on doubling its impact by mobilizing Canadians and delivering permanent large-scale conservation success.

The cloud-based data warehousing company went public at $120 per share then more than doubled on its first trade to $245. It attracted so much attention for two reasons: It was growing like a weed and it was backed by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and Salesforce (NYSE: CRM).

Snowflake's stock eventually soared to an all-time high of $401.85 last November. But today it trades at around $170 per share. The high-flying stock dropped back to the earth as investors fretted over its slowing growth lack of profits and high valuations -- which made it a soft target for the bears while rising interest rates drove investors toward more conservative investments.

Nevertheless Snowflake is still growing a lot faster than many of its cloud-based peers -- and it expects that growth to continue through the end of the decade.

Snowflake is currently worth about $54 billion so it's still dwarfed by cloud giants like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) which has a market cap of nearly $1.6 trillion. But could Snowflake continue growing and become even more valuable than Alphabet by the end of the decade? Let's review Snowflake's business model growth rates and valuations to decide.

Why is Snowflake growing so quickly?

Snowflake's revenue rose 174% in fiscal 2020 124% in fiscal 2021 and 106% to $1.22 billion in fiscal 2022 which ended this January. The secular expansion of the data warehousing market is driving that rapid growth.

In the past large companies often stored their data on various types of software across different computing platforms. That fragmentation created ""data silos"" which reduced their overall efficiency.

Snowflake breaks down those silos and pulls that data into a centralized cloud-based warehouse where it can be easily accessed by third-party apps and data visualization platforms like Salesforce's Tableau and Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) Power BI. This approach helps companies make better data-driven decisions.

What are Snowflake's long-term plans?

Snowflake generated 94% of its revenue from its product segment last year. It expects its product revenue to grow from $1.14 billion in fiscal 2022 to about $10 billion in fiscal 2029 which implies its top line can grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36% over the next seven years.

By fiscal 2029 Snowflake expects approximately 1400 of its customers to generate over $1 million in trailing 12-month product revenues by fiscal 2029 compared to only 184 million-dollar customers in fiscal 2022. It also expects its annual revenues from that high-value cohort to rise from $3.5 million in fiscal 2022 to $5.5 million in fiscal 2029.

Snowflake already served 241 of the Fortune 500 companies and 488 of the Global 2000 companies at the end of fiscal 2022 but it expects to gain even more large customers as they upgrade their aging IT infrastructure.

Snowflake is still deeply unprofitable. But between fiscal 2022 and 2029 it expects its adjusted gross product margin to expand from 69% to 78% and for its adjusted operating margin to rise from negative 3% to positive 20%. That forecast implies it can maintain its pricing power as it expands.

But Snowflake won't be worth more than Alphabet

Snowflake still trades at 27 times this year's sales and it's doubtful it can maintain that frothy price-to-sales ratio if its annual revenue growth slows down to about 30% to 40%. If Snowflake generates $10 billion in revenue by fiscal 2029 -- and its stock is trading at a more reasonable 15 times forward sales -- it would be worth about $150 billion in calendar 2029.

But that would still be less than a tenth of Alphabet's current market cap. Furthermore Alphabet's valuation could also climb much higher by the end of the decade as its core advertising and cloud businesses continue to expand. Simply put Snowflake won't come close to matching Alphabet's market cap by 2030 even if it checks off all its long-term goals.

But investors shouldn't assume Snowflake can achieve those goals. Snowflake's success is already prompting Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Microsoft and Google to upgrade their own cloud-based data warehousing services -- which are bundled into their market-leading cloud infrastructure platforms. Snowflake also runs its platform on top of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Azure and Google Cloud -- so it's still ironically paying service fees to its top competitors. If those cloud giants get serious about challenging Snowflake they could hike their hosting fees while undercutting Snowflake's prices.

Snowflake's stock could double or triple by the end of the decade even as its growth cools off and its valuations decline. However it's still expensive after its 50% decline this year and it could continue to underperform many other cloud stocks which are trading at more reasonable valuations.

Stock investors have now contended with two bear markets in a span of 2 1/2 years. They're also facing historically high inflation and back-to-back quarters of U.S. gross domestic product retracements.

Yet in spite of this turmoil cryptocurrencies have soared. Since bottoming out at an aggregate valuation of $141 billion in March 2020 the total value of the crypto market has exploded to nearly $3 trillion. Even following a sizable pullback the value of all digital currencies is higher by nearly 700% in 29 months.

Shiba Inu has set the standard for historic gains in the cryptocurrency space

Although crypto's ""Big Two"" -- Bitcoin and Ethereum -- are given a lot of credit for these nominal gains it's the jaw-dropping percentage gain in meme token Shiba Inu (CRYPTO: SHIB) that's driven interest in the digital currency space.

In 2021 Shiba Inu did things that were previously thought impossible from an investable asset. After beginning the year at a microscopic valuation of $0.000000000073 per token according to CoinMarketCap.com SHIB would climb to an all-time high of $0.00008841 less than 10 months later. By removing six zeroes after its decimal point SHIB coins skyrocketed an unfathomable 121109489%! Put another way an investor with the luck stomach and wherewithal to invest one dollar at midnight on Jan. 1 2021 was a millionaire by Oct. 27 2021.

Following a sizable pullback SHIB tokens ended 2021 higher by approximately 46000000% and set the standard for what momentum and social media hype can achieve in the cryptocurrency space.

However Shiba Inu investors aren't counting on SHIB's run-up being a one-and-done. In the two-month stretch between June 18 2022 and Aug. 18 2022 SHIB has more than doubled in value to nearly $0.000015. It's beginning to reignite the momentum-based euphoria that sparked the token's 2021 run as well as renewing calls among holders that SHIB could eventually reach $0.01 per coin.

What would it take for Shiba Inu to increase in value by more than 67000% to reach $0.01 per token by as soon as 2023? Let's take a closer look.

What would it take for Shiba Inu to reach $0.01?

In order for SHIB to make a second historic run over a three-year stretch (2021-2023) three catalysts would have to be executed flawlessly.

To begin with innovation would have to drive Shiba Inu tokens higher. The key project at the moment is the expected launch of a public beta test of Shibarium during the third quarter (July through September).

Shibarium is an internally developed layer-2 blockchain that's designed to dramatically lower transaction costs for SHIB. If transactions costs fall by a considerable amount it would likely encourage more merchants to accept SHIB as a form of payment. But more importantly it would roll out the red carpet for non-fungible token (NFT)-based gaming and NFT marketplaces to thrive. Shiba Inu's developers can't meaningfully venture into the metaverse or blockchain-based gaming until transactions costs are brought down.

Secondly Shiba Inu would have to conduct meaningful and ongoing coin burn events. Think of coin burn as being similar to a publicly traded company buying back its own stock. By removing existing tokens from the circulating supply each remaining coin that investors hold on to is a bit scarcer. That's important because CoinMarketCap.com lists the project as having roughly 549 trillion coins outstanding as of this past week. There would need to be a significant number of coins removed from circulation to provide a lift to SHIB's price.

For what it's worth Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin who was gifted roughly half of SHIB's 1 quadrillion token supply sent more than 410 trillion coins to a dead blockchain address last year. With these coins now inaccessible 41% of SHIB's supply was taken out with the click of a button.

And third Shiba Inu would need a repeat of the social media euphoria that sent it ascending to the heavens in 2021. While there's no concrete blueprint social media sites would need to be abuzz with SHIB for momentum to take over.

The doghouse is far likelier for SHIB than reaching $0.01 in 2023

Now that we've had a look at what would need to happen for Shiba Inu to reach $0.01 by 2023 let's get down to brass tacks: How feasible is $0.01 by 2023?

While nothing can ever be written off in the cryptocurrency arena following a 46000000% single-year gain there's virtually no chance of SHIB coming anywhere close to $0.01 by the end of next year. In fact winding up in the doghouse is more likely than SHIB heading higher from its current price.

To start with the basics a $0.01 target would equate to a nearly $5.5 trillion valuation. That's nearly two times the market cap of Apple a company that's generated over $118 billion in operating cash flow over the trailing-12-month period and has led with its innovation for more than a decade. Shiba Inu hasn't demonstrated that any of its innovations are going to work let alone be useful in the real world. That's makes a $5.5 trillion market cap pretty much untenable.

Maybe the bigger issue is that Shiba Inu lacks anything resembling a competitive advantage. While it does have faithful holders Shiba Inu is ultimately nothing more than an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. In other words it's just a glorified payment coin and there are thousands of cryptocurrencies that can facilitate payments.

To build on this point it's not even a popular payment coin. According to online business directory Cryptwerk only 659 mostly obscure global merchants were accepting SHIB as a form of payment in August 2022. This figure hasn't budged in months due to the volatility in SHIB's price and its inability to stand out in an increasingly crowded field.

Coin burn also seems unlikely to meaningfully help Shiba Inu. While a small percentage of merchants and coin burn events could remove millions or even billions of tokens from circulation whittling down 549 trillion coins into a much smaller figure that would allow for SHIB's price to appreciate is going to take a really long time.

Lastly history has proved unkind to payment coins that deliver monumental gains. Following their peak (which was Oct. 27 2021 for SHIB) payment coins have a history of losing 93% to 99%+ of their value in the subsequent two years. Shiba Inu already shed 91% of its value at its peak decline through June 2022. The expectation is that SHIB is facing an even larger retracement.

One big force at the center of the two-month equity rally is showing signs of fatigue.It’s the behavior of short sellers whose frantic efforts to unwind bearish wagers created buying that added fuel to the $7 trillion share advance. Evidence is arising now that the process is petering out.Hedge funds that make both bullish and bearish equity bets pretty much stopped purchasing shares to return to lenders this week after previously doing it at the fastest pace in more than two years data from JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s prime broker unit show.Meanwhile Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s hedge-fund clients boosted short positions Wednesday with bets against exchange-traded funds rising the most in more than two months.The shift makes sense from certain technical perspectives. The S&P 500 this week failed to surpass a key long-term trendline its 200-day average. A bunch of potentially bearish events are coming up from central bankers’ annual retreat in Jackson Hole Wyoming to the release of government data on consumer prices and employment.“Hedge funds may view the June-to-August rally as too far too fast and now are licking their chops for another round of downside” said Mike Bailey director of research at wealth management firm FBB Capital Partners. “Tactically markets look a bit feeble at the moment as investors price in good inflation and Fed news.”Since the market’s trough in June computer-driven traders such as trend followers that are mostly active in the futures market have snapped up about $100 billion of equities Morgan Stanley ’s trading unit estimated as many went short during the first-half rout and were caught off guard by the subsequent rebound.There are still a lot of bearish positions outstanding Morgan Stanley’s data show. In the cash market while $50 billion has been covered since June the net amount of added shorts remains elevated sitting at $165 billion this year. Short interest among single stocks stands in the 84th percentile of a one-year range.“The short base in US equities is still not cleaned up though” Morgan Stanley wrote in a note. “With short leverage still high there is more potential for hedge fund short covering.”For now however hedge funds are taking a breather. After spending the past month unwinding bearish trades at a pace last seen at the start of the pandemic bull market JPMorgan’s hedge-fund clients stopped covering this week.At Goldman hedge funds increased short sales while added longs on Wednesday leading to the biggest jump in gross trading activity since the market’s low in mid-June. Though with shorts sales outpacing long buys by a ratio of 3-to-1 net selling hit a three-week high.Shorts unwinding amplified the market upside during the summer lull but all the caution suggests that the downside risk is likely limited and it potentially sets the stage for further gains should things start to improve according to Benjamin Dunn president of Alpha Theory Advisors.“Nobody trusts the rally” Dunn said. “We could be in for a period of weakness but by the same token a lot of people who want to sell have already sold” he added. “That’s been the problem the last several months in this market. It’s nothing but positioning almost nothing fundamental.”"

The actress spoke with Decider for an interview published Friday to promote her new film Spin Me Round and she was asked about the surprising turn of events surrounding the end of her Netflix series GLOW. In September 2019 the show had been picked up for a fourth and final season but the streamer reversed the decision in October 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic and announced it was done for good.

“It’s the great heartbreak of my career” Brie admitted to the outlet. “But it will forever live on as like this great thing. I loved working on it — maybe more than anything I’ve worked on — and I miss it a lot. But I feel very grateful for the time I had on the show.”

When asked further about Netflix’s change of plans Brie added “Yeah it was surprising! But it was sort of eclipsed by the shock of everything that was happening globally. (Laughs.) You know so in a way it was almost like it put things in perspective.”

GLOW which earned 18 Emmy nominations and three wins over the course of its run was a fictionalized telling of the real-life women’s professional wrestling program called Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling that launched in the 1980s.

Brie played Ruth Wilder a struggling actress who becomes a wrestler. The Netflix series also starred Betty Gilpin Sydelle Noel Britney Young and Marc Maron.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvYWxpc29uLWJyaWUtZ2xvdy1jYW5jZWxsYXRpb24tbmV0ZmxpeC0xMjM1MDk3MTcyL9IBUmh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvYWxpc29uLWJyaWUtZ2xvdy1jYW5jZWxsYXRpb24tbmV0ZmxpeC0xMjM1MDk3MTcyL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alison Brie Opens Up About ‘GLOW’ Cancellation By Netflix: “It’s The Great Heartbreak Of My Career”,"Alison Brie is opening up about GLOW getting canceled by Netflix almost two years later. The actor has moved on to other projects but the show about female wrestlers still has a special place in her heart.

“It’s the great heartbreak of my career” Brie told Decider about the show getting cut by the streamer. “But it will forever live on as like this great thing. I loved working on it — maybe more than anything I’ve worked on! — and I miss it a lot. But I feel very grateful for the time I had on the show.”

Netflix had picked up GLOW for a fourth and final season in August 2019 but reversed its decision when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. The show had already been in production of the final season for about three weeks when filming was shut down amid the coronavirus outbreak. It would be in October 2020 when the streaming service would announce that production for the series would not resume.

“Yeah it was surprising!” Brie said of the cancellation. “But it was sort of eclipsed by the shock of everything that was happening globally. [Laughs] You know so in a way it was almost like it put things in perspective.”

Over the lifetime of the show GLOW earned 15 Emmy nominations and received three wins. The short-lived series was set in the 1980s and revolved around Ruth Wilder (Brie) an out-of-work struggling actress in Los Angeles who finds one last chance for stardom when she’s thrust into the glitter and spandex world of women’s pro wrestling."

This quote is also an apt metaphor for a career that's seen the 57-year-old rise to the position of editor of News of the World at just 29 be sacked from rival tabloid the Daily Mirror for publishing fake photographs of British soldiers in Iraq - before securing a job on CNN in the U.S. - only to be axed three years into the deal in 2014 due to poor ratings.

He was then hired as Mail Online's editor-at-large where Morgan maintained his well-read column while stepping back onto television with a fulltime hosting role on Good Morning Britain.

In 2021 Morgan stormed off the set and out of the job after he was confronted on air about comments he made regarding Meghan Markle following her controversial Oprah interview with Prince Harry.

But just one year later Morgan finds himself under a new kind of pressure just six months after signing a monster $100million (AUD) deal with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.

The word from Sky News' Sydney headquarters is 'Piers Morgan: Uncensored' - only launched in April - may ultimately be dumped from Australian screens due to poor ratings.

The show which premiered in the U.S. on Fox on the new British channel TVTalk and on Sky News in Australia initially attracted solid numbers on the back of a multi-million dollar advertising campaign and an interview with Donald Trump.

Piers Morgan's show is struggling in the ratings. He's pictured here with a cocktail in front of the Murdoch's private jet

Piers Morgan: Uncensored has sunk to a viewership of less than 100000 in the UK and 18000 in Australia

In Australia 90000 viewers tuned in to the first hour-long program which airs from Sunday to Thursday at 9pm.

However within just a few weeks those numbers had dropped significantly.

Shortly before Morgan's four-week long summer hiatus which he announced to his Twitter followers in late July Uncensored was drawing an average of just 18000 viewers in Australia.

It's a slide mirrored in the UK viewing figures which have dropped by about 80% since its debut - from 317000 to just 60000.

Morgan has featured a number of high-profile names on his show including Cristiano Ronaldo

Piers was pictured leaving Lachlan Murdoch's private jet after arriving in Sydney for the 25th anniversary dinner in February (above)

Piers flew to Australia with Lachlan Murdoch (above leaving the AU$90million Gulfstream G650)

Morgan's figures in Australia are dwarfed by his Sky News colleagues. Paul Murray's 'Paul Murray Live' regularly averages over 40000 viewers per night.

Credlin helmed by Tony Abbott's former chief of staff Peta Credlin also easily out-performed Uncensored with a 35000 nightly average.

For context Sky News' free-to-air prime-time rivals Seven News and Nine News average about 900000 viewers per night combined.

However Sky's top talent is watched widely on YouTube with some Australian hosts surprisingly popular in the U.S.

Now on a month-long break in the US where it's understood he is filming another season of his series Serial Killers 'Piers Morgan's Uncensored' is not being shown on Sky News' Australian schedule despite remaining on air in the UK under fill-in host Jeremy Kyle.

Most promotional images of Morgan have been quietly removed from the Sky News' website.

Morgan's relative failure comes with a degree of irony given he was supposed to be the big-name replacement for Alan Jones who was dumped by Sky News in November 2021 despite pulling an audience of 63000.

Lauded as Sky News' antidote to 'cancel culture' Morgan kicked off his series with a sit-down with Donald Trump.

'I'm going to cancel the cancel culture' he told Peta Credlin on Sky. 'I'm going to take those ultra woke lunatics head on.'

News Corp paid big money to promote the show (above is the ad near Sydney's Anzac Bridge)

Peta Credlin easily out-performed Uncensored with a 35000 nightly average.

Paul Murray remains the most popular figure on Sky News Australia despite earning a fraction of what Morgan is paid

Morgan boasted he would be 'calling out extremists from all sides not just in Australia but anywhere – and especially those who think cancel culture's a great idea and want to compel us all to lead their own dreary joyless lifestyles'.

Morgan began what was a lavish promotional push in February when he arrived in Australia via Lachlan Murdoch's private jet to attend the 25th anniversary party of Sky News at the Sydney Opera House.

Discussing the upcoming election Morgan said he predicted Australians would 'elect the leader who they believe will move most swiftly to restore all freedom rights lost during the crisis and who will be strong on national security'.

Morgan's TV deal has a number of 'performance-based clauses' which allow News Corp to cut him loose say sources

Alan Jones made way for Morgan after he was dumped in November 2021

He later partied the night away with his new News Corp colleagues and followed it up with an appearance on Today opposite Karl Stefanovic (brother of Sky News breakfast anchor Peter Stefanovic) and Allison Langdon.

'Great to be back on breakfast TV again.. even if I did have to fly 10000 miles to find a morning show that would let me express my opinions!' he later tweeted.

But despite the international promotional push sources close to contract negotiations have told Daily Mail Australia that there were a number of 'performance-based' clauses built into Morgan's contract.

'Basically if the show doesn't rate it allows (News Corp) to exercise one or more of those clauses and end the contract without having to pay the full terms' said an insider.

'And it clearly isn't rating. So perhaps that's what Murdoch will now do.'

Followed categories will be added to My News.

A dry track could hold the key to the promising Shalatin’s potential return in Saturday’s Group 3 Up And Coming Stakes (1300m) at Rosehill.

Trainer Joseph Pride is keen to test his classy colt in stakes grade again this preparation and has waited for the opportune moment to unleash him.

Shalatin has been nominated for several races in recent weeks including a maiden at Newcastle two weeks ago but firmer tracks have been the key.

“I couldn’t be happier with him we just struck a heavy track the other day” Pride said.

“He has had a few trials now and he is ready to go back to the races.

“I am kind of thinking he is a horse that is going to get over a bit of ground maybe the mile but we will find that out as we get into his prep but he is going well.”

Shalatin is still a maiden but showed plenty of promise in five starts as a two-year-old.

The son of Shalaa was a narrow runner up to the talented Sejardan in the Golden Gift last November and placed behind the same colt in the Group 2 Todman Stakes in the autumn.

A foot issue forced Pride to scratch him before he got the chance to run in a Golden Slipper before he finished sixth in the Group 1 Sires’ Produce Stakes at his final two-year-old start.

“He got there through raw ability” Pride said.

Shalatin is featured in several major TAB markets for the spring with the colt currently rated $26 for both the Golden Rose (September 24) at Rosehill and the Caulfield Guineas (October 8) at Caulfield.

Pride’s top stayer Stockman returned in top order on Saturday when doing his best work late to finish ninth in the Group 1 Winx Stakes.

Jockey Sam Clipperton said; “Very happy with him. A stayer first up he’s gone terrific.”

Pride plans to aim at The Metropolitan where Stockman is now an $11 chance.

With colourful owner Allan Endresz no longer in Alligator Blood's ownership News Corp can reveal it has paved the way for the Group 1 winner to race in the spring starting with the Group 1 Memsie Stakes at Caulfield on Saturday.

Alligator Blood will race in Harvey's blue and white racing colours.

Damien Oliver will ride Alligator Blood in the Group 1 Memsie on Saturday.

News Corp exclusively revealed recently that Magic Millions supremo and leviathan owner-breeder Harvey could buy some or all of Alligator Blood.

Alligator Blood was purchased by Endresz's Ezybonds No 1 Syndicate for $55000 from Harvey at the 2018 Gold Coast Yearling Sale.

News Corp understands Harvey has now purchased 60 per cent of Alligator Blood and the remaining 40 per cent is owned by Robyn and Jeff Simpson.

Endresz who had been barred from racing horses in Victoria and NSW due to his status as an undischarged bankrupt is no longer in the ownership of the two-time Group 1 winning star horse.

The Alligator Blood drama has dominated the early stages of the spring carnival with Endresz making several proposals to Racing Victoria in a bid to reverse their ban.

They were initially rejected but with Endresz no longer in the ownership Alligator Blood has been cleared for takeoff.

Alligator Blood gave co-trainer Gai Waterhouse her first Stradbroke Handicap win and her 150th Group 1 triumph earlier this year.

Adrian Bott who trains in partnership with Waterhouse said it was a relief to have the issue resolved.

""We are really looking forward to getting Alligator Blood back to the races and thankful for the support and opportunity from Gerry Harvey"" Bott said.

""Hopefully we can repay Gerry with a successful spring campaign. It's good to have certainty around the preparation now and we can put some more certain plans into place now.""

Allan Endresz (centre) with Robyn and Jeff Simpson said selling his majority interest in Alligator Blood was a very tough decision. Picture: Steve Holland

The change of ownership does not avert the legal stoush that Endresz will embark on against Racing Victoria – it probably only exacerbates it.

Endresz who lost his terminally ill wife Joy on the day after Alligator Blood won the Stradbroke told News Corp: ""Selling the majority interest in Alligator Blood was a very emotional and tough decision for me to make.

""Alligator Blood means everything to me and my family.

""Alligator Blood will always be part of our lives with or without a financial interest.

""In loving memory of my wife Joy and in the interests of his legion of Blood Supporters this forced sale is the best possible outcome for Alligator Blood and racing.

""What's important is that Alligator Blood's love of racing and his ‘never give up' spirit will continue on.

""This is something that Joy practised each and every day as she battled her terminal cancer.""

It's a slide mirrored in the UK viewing figures which have dropped by about 80% since its debut - from 317000 to just 60000.

Morgan has featured a number of high-profile names on his show including Cristiano Ronaldo

Morgan's figures in Australia are dwarfed by his Sky News colleagues. Paul Murray's 'Paul Murray Live' regularly averages over 40000 viewers per night.

Credlin helmed by Tony Abbott's former chief of staff Peta Credlin also easily out-performed Uncensored with a 35000 nightly average.

For context Sky News' free-to-air prime-time rivals Seven News and Nine News average about 900000 viewers per night combined.

However Sky's top talent is watched widely on YouTube with some Australian hosts surprisingly popular in the U.S.

Now on a month-long break in the US where it's understood he is filming another season of his series Serial Killers 'Piers Morgan's Uncensored' is not being shown on Sky News' Australian schedule despite remaining on air in the UK under fill-in host Jeremy Kyle.

Most promotional images of Morgan have been quietly removed from the Sky News' website.

Morgan's relative failure comes with a degree of irony given he was supposed to be the big-name replacement for Alan Jones who was dumped by Sky News in November 2021 despite pulling an audience of 63000.

Lauded as Sky News' antidote to 'cancel culture' Morgan kicked off his series with a sit-down with Donald Trump.

'I'm going to cancel the cancel culture' he told Peta Credlin on Sky. 'I'm going to take those ultra woke lunatics head on.'

Peta Credlin easily out-performed Uncensored with a 35000 nightly average.

Paul Murray remains the most popular figure on Sky News Australia despite earning a fraction of what Morgan is paid

Morgan boasted he would be 'calling out extremists from all sides not just in Australia but anywhere – and especially those who think cancel culture's a great idea and want to compel us all to lead their own dreary joyless lifestyles'.

Morgan began what was a lavish promotional push in February when he arrived in Australia via Lachlan Murdoch's private jet to attend the 25th anniversary party of Sky News at the Sydney Opera House.

Discussing the upcoming election Morgan said he predicted Australians would 'elect the leader who they believe will move most swiftly to restore all freedom rights lost during the crisis and who will be strong on national security'.

Morgan's TV deal has a number of 'performance-based clauses' which allow News Corp to cut him loose say sources

Alan Jones made way for Morgan after he was dumped in November 2021

He later partied the night away with his new News Corp colleagues and followed it up with an appearance on Today opposite Karl Stefanovic (brother of Sky News breakfast anchor Peter Stefanovic) and Allison Langdon.

'Great to be back on breakfast TV again.. even if I did have to fly 10000 miles to find a morning show that would let me express my opinions!' he later tweeted.

But despite the international promotional push sources close to contract negotiations have told Daily Mail Australia that there were a number of 'performance-based' clauses built into Morgan's contract.

'Basically if the show doesn't rate it allows (News Corp) to exercise one or more of those clauses and end the contract without having to pay the full terms' said an insider.

'And it clearly isn't rating. So perhaps that's what Murdoch will now do.'

Followed categories will be added to My News.

A dry track could hold the key to the promising Shalatin’s potential return in Saturday’s Group 3 Up And Coming Stakes (1300m) at Rosehill.

Trainer Joseph Pride is keen to test his classy colt in stakes grade again this preparation and has waited for the opportune moment to unleash him.

Shalatin has been nominated for several races in recent weeks including a maiden at Newcastle two weeks ago but firmer tracks have been the key.

“I couldn’t be happier with him we just struck a heavy track the other day” Pride said.

“He has had a few trials now and he is ready to go back to the races.

“I am kind of thinking he is a horse that is going to get over a bit of ground maybe the mile but we will find that out as we get into his prep but he is going well.”

Shalatin is still a maiden but showed plenty of promise in five starts as a two-year-old.

The son of Shalaa was a narrow runner up to the talented Sejardan in the Golden Gift last November and placed behind the same colt in the Group 2 Todman Stakes in the autumn.

A foot issue forced Pride to scratch him before he got the chance to run in a Golden Slipper before he finished sixth in the Group 1 Sires’ Produce Stakes at his final two-year-old start.

“He got there through raw ability” Pride said.

Shalatin is featured in several major TAB markets for the spring with the colt currently rated $26 for both the Golden Rose (September 24) at Rosehill and the Caulfield Guineas (October 8) at Caulfield.

Pride’s top stayer Stockman returned in top order on Saturday when doing his best work late to finish ninth in the Group 1 Winx Stakes.

Jockey Sam Clipperton said; “Very happy with him. A stayer first up he’s gone terrific.”

Pride plans to aim at The Metropolitan where Stockman is now an $11 chance.

With colourful owner Allan Endresz no longer in Alligator Blood's ownership News Corp can reveal it has paved the way for the Group 1 winner to race in the spring starting with the Group 1 Memsie Stakes at Caulfield on Saturday.

Alligator Blood will race in Harvey's blue and white racing colours.

Damien Oliver will ride Alligator Blood in the Group 1 Memsie on Saturday.

News Corp exclusively revealed recently that Magic Millions supremo and leviathan owner-breeder Harvey could buy some or all of Alligator Blood.

Alligator Blood was purchased by Endresz's Ezybonds No 1 Syndicate for $55000 from Harvey at the 2018 Gold Coast Yearling Sale.

News Corp understands Harvey has now purchased 60 per cent of Alligator Blood and the remaining 40 per cent is owned by Robyn and Jeff Simpson.

Endresz who had been barred from racing horses in Victoria and NSW due to his status as an undischarged bankrupt is no longer in the ownership of the two-time Group 1 winning star horse.

The Alligator Blood drama has dominated the early stages of the spring carnival with Endresz making several proposals to Racing Victoria in a bid to reverse their ban.

They were initially rejected but with Endresz no longer in the ownership Alligator Blood has been cleared for takeoff.

Alligator Blood gave co-trainer Gai Waterhouse her first Stradbroke Handicap win and her 150th Group 1 triumph earlier this year.

Adrian Bott who trains in partnership with Waterhouse said it was a relief to have the issue resolved.

""We are really looking forward to getting Alligator Blood back to the races and thankful for the support and opportunity from Gerry Harvey"" Bott said.

""Hopefully we can repay Gerry with a successful spring campaign. It's good to have certainty around the preparation now and we can put some more certain plans into place now.""

Allan Endresz (centre) with Robyn and Jeff Simpson said selling his majority interest in Alligator Blood was a very tough decision. Picture: Steve Holland

The change of ownership does not avert the legal stoush that Endresz will embark on against Racing Victoria – it probably only exacerbates it.

Endresz who lost his terminally ill wife Joy on the day after Alligator Blood won the Stradbroke told News Corp: ""Selling the majority interest in Alligator Blood was a very emotional and tough decision for me to make.

""Alligator Blood means everything to me and my family.

""Alligator Blood will always be part of our lives with or without a financial interest.

""In loving memory of my wife Joy and in the interests of his legion of Blood Supporters this forced sale is the best possible outcome for Alligator Blood and racing.

""What's important is that Alligator Blood's love of racing and his ‘never give up' spirit will continue on.

""This is something that Joy practised each and every day as she battled her terminal cancer.""

The treatment plant is the centerpiece of the township's sewer system which a Florida company NextEra Water has agreed to buy for $115.3 million. Read more

Towamencin Township a suburban Montgomery County community with a population of about 18000 received bids in February from five suitors to acquire its municipal sewer system. The offers left township supervisors breathless.

Pennsylvania American Water the state’s largest private water utility offered to pay $92.4 million for the township’s system about 71% more than the bid of its principal rival Aqua Pennsylvania the state’s second largest water utility.

But the real shock was a bid from NextEra Water a Florida company that owns no other Pennsylvania water utilities. It offered to pay Towamencin $115.3 million for its wastewater system — 25% more than Pennsylvania American Water and more than double Aqua’s bid of $54.1 million.

“When we received two bids over $90 million to say I was surprised would be an understatement” Supervisor Richard Marino told a town hall meeting in April.

The NextEra offer of $115.3 million was “totally out of line with what we thought we would receive” H. Charles Wilson III the chairman of the township’s board of supervisors said at the meeting. NextEra’s offer for the sewer system amounts to nearly eight times the township’s entire annual operating budget of $15 million.

The supervisors said the sale of the sewer system and its 7500 accounts to NextEra would allow Towamencin to retire its debt forestall property tax increases finance some projects immediately and stash $87 million in the bank. Future township improvements would be funded just from the interest earned on the $87 million reserve. Marino called the sale “a generational opportunity to reboot and reset our finances for the foreseeable future.”

The township supervisors voted 4-1 in May to accept the NextEra bid over vocal objections of residents who fear that homeowners and businesses will pay higher sewer rates to cover NextEra’s elevated purchase price. The opponents are organizing a ballot campaign to rewrite the town’s charter to block the sewer system sale and reverse the “backdoor tax increase” on sewer customers.

Regardless of the final resolution of Towamencin’s political turmoil the sale process has been a stunning debut for NextEra Water a new player with deep pockets in the competition to buy up Pennsylvania’s fragmented municipal water and wastewater systems.

NextEra Water is a subsidiary of NextEra Energy of Juno Beach Fla. an infrastructure firm whose principal asset is an electric utility Florida Power and Light. It also owns a large portfolio of renewable energy assets.

‘The largest company you’ve never heard of’

NextEra Energy is sometimes called “the largest company that you’ve never heard of” Bruce Hauk the president of NextEra Water said during an introductory meeting with Towamencin residents in April.

Though NextEra says it is an experienced operator of wastewater systems at its own power plants it began to explore expanding into water utilities only in the last year.

The frenzy to consolidate systems in Pennsylvania has been spurred by a 2016 state law Act 12 which has revolutionized the privatization process by incentivizing the sale of water and wastewater systems at “fair market” prices which can be much higher than the actual book value of the assets.

Until recently the competition in Pennsylvania has largely been dominated by the nation’s two biggest investor-owned water companies both headquartered in the Philadelphia area: American Water Works Co. Inc. based in Camden and Aqua America a subsidiary of Essential Utilities Inc. of Bryn Mawr. Both are experienced at navigating the region’s political and regulatory systems vital skills for public utilities whose operations require close cooperation with government.

But private equity funds are showing heightened interest in buying municipal utilities which require ever more capital to replace aging infrastructure and to respond to new climate and environmental challenges such as contamination by compounds known as PFAS. Unlike some other states that have enacted legislation that allow only fair-market acquisitions of distressed municipal utilities Pennsylvania’s Act 12 legislation can make it attractive for any town to sell at a high price.

“You can really go after any system in Pennsylvania” said an investment analyst who follows the industry and was not authorized to speak publicly. “That really makes the big guys open to the market. Plus Pennsylvania has scale — it’s a large state with a lot of opportunity.”

Several investment firms have recently entered the Pennsylvania market primarily focused on leasing and not buying municipal systems which they would operate through contractors.

VICO Infrastructure a California venture that works in partnership with the the private equity giant Carlyle Group was a distant bidder in the Towamencin process. And Bernhard Capital Partners of Baton Rouge La. has been active in bidding for leases in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

NextEra Water also tried to bid for the Bucks County Water and Sewer Authority recently but was rebuffed when BCWSA last month awarded Aqua Pennsylvania the right to finalize a $1.1 billion offer for its sewer system. Bucks officials said they favored operators with a Pennsylvania track record.

Recouping $115.3 million

The question of how NextEra would recover its $115.3 million purchase price from Towamencin’s 7500 customers and the impact on rates was a central issue raised by opponents of the sale.

Christopher H. Franklin the chairman of Essential Utilities told investment analysts in October that an established water utility such as Aqua has an advantage because it can spread the cost of acquisitions and improvements across an existing customer base of nearly 500000 customers in Pennsylvania.

But a company such as NextEra which has 5.7 million electric customers in Florida can’t pass on the costs of its Pennsylvania water utility acquisitions to Florida ratepayers. “They can’t spread their water costs on their electric customers” said Franklin said. “So they’ve still got to confine any rate increases for acquisitions on those customers they have.”

NextEra’s Hauk said the company did not plan to recover the full price in rates. The amount it could recover would be set by Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission based on fair-market appraisals if the sale were approved.

It seems clear to most observers that NextEra is paying an above-market price for the Towamencin system to establish a base upon which it can expand in Pennsylvania by buying other systems.

“Sometimes companies will do that to penetrate the market get their foot in the door and are fully aware that they’re probably not going to get the return on investment and recover the full 115″ million dollars said Supervisor Marino a contractor by trade.

Aqua ‘not too worried’ as NextEra expands

NextEra last year signaled its broader interest in water utilities when it announced the acquisition of a portfolio of 23 water and five wastewater utility systems in several counties surrounding Houston. The deal with Quadvest L.P. another private investor closed last month. The purchase price was undisclosed.

Rebecca Kujawa NextEra’s chief financial officer told investment analysts in October that the acquisition of the Texas properties reflected the company’s plans to create a national water utility.

“The proposed acquisition expands our regulated utility business in an attractive market with significant expected customer growth and furthers our strategy to build a world class water utility in the coming years” Kujawa said. “We are optimistic about the strong growth anticipated in this new market and the potential for clean water solutions to generate additional contracted renewables opportunities going forward.”

Some analysts are impressed by NextEra’s expansion into water.

“This move provides the company with huge growth potential as the U.S. water and wastewater utility industry is highly fragmented” the Motley Fool investment advisory service said in a June blog post. “NextEra’s considerable financial resources give its NextEra Water subsidiary the potential to be a formidable player.”

The activity of a giant such as NextEra also did not go unnoticed in the corporate suite of Essential Utilities in Bryn Mawr. NextEra’s market valuation of $179 billion is about 13 times the market capitalization of Essential Utilities. NextEra had $17 billion in revenue last year three times the combined sales of the two Philadelphia area water companies Essential Utilities and American Water.

Franklin the chairman of Essential Utilities told analysts last year that Aqua welcomed NextEra and was “not too worried about” the competition.

“As we think about this privatization trend the more that occurs successfully the better it is” Franklin said. “We think this is a pretty big market. We’ve certainly been successful in our market share and we think we can continue to do that.”

A big customer objects

NextEra said it would operate the Towamencin system through a contractor U.S. Water Services Corp. an unaffiliated Florida company.

The township’s adviser on the sale Public Financial Management Inc. (PFM) projected the township’s future sewer rates if the township retained the system compared with rates under private ownership adjusted to reflect the amount each household would save in reduced property taxes if the township banked the sewer sale proceeds. PFM projected that township residents would be better off if the township sold the system.

PFM’s projections were met with skepticism by opponents who argue that PFM is not an impartial adviser: The firm stands to earn an $807000 fee — 0.7% of the sale price — if the deal closes next year. If there is no sale PFM makes a $9500 fee.

“We don’t believe the numbers that have been shown throughout the presentations are accurate” said James Lee general counsel of the Clemens Food Group the makers of Hatfield meats whose processing facility in neighboring Hatfield Township is the largest customer on the Towamencin wastewater system.

The meat producer estimates that its annual sewer fees would double to $1.6 million if the sale went through “which will significantly impact our operations in Hatfield” Lee said at the April town hall. He warned the township that Clemens is “looking at all options to either reduce or eliminate our flow” to Towamencin should the sale go through.

In the end the township supervisors were unmoved by the opposition calling the sale a “no brainer.”

“It’s a huge plus for the community to be able to pay off all the debt create space in the annual operating budget to do other initiatives and to meet future increase in costs” said Wilson the chairman of the board.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaGljYWdvdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8yMS9zb2xhci1wcm9qZWN0LXBsYW5uZWQtZm9yLWZhcm1sYW5kLWluLXNvdXRoZXJuLXBvcnRlci1jb3VudHktYnV0LWRldmVsb3BlcnMtYXJlLW11bS1vbi13aGljaC1mYXJtZXJzLXdpbGwtcGFydGljaXBhdGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Solar project planned for farmland in southern Porter County but developers are mum on which farmers will participate,"Matt Sheafer farms around 900 acres in Kankakee Township in Jasper County in corn and soybeans in what he described as “a typical Indiana farm.”

Sheafer who’s been farming outside of Wheatfield for 10 years and farmed for 20 years in Crown Point before that will soon house a different crop that relies on the sun to produce a yield: solar panels.

“Approximately one-third of our ground is going to go into solar and I’m going to farm around it” Sheafer said on a recent morning.

The soil in Jasper County is sandy he said and every year his crops get stressed because of drought. He uses a no-till method for farming strip intercropping alternating sections of corn and soybeans to maximize the amount of sunlight each crop receives.

“I kept the better ground to farm. The land that’s less productive is going into solar” he said adding he looks at farming as an investment. “You’re just maximizing your return on that lesser ground.”

NextEra Energy Resources is proposing a $250 million investment in Porter County through its Malden Solar project with an estimated $52 million coming back to the county over the life of the project an estimated 35 years.

The project still in its preliminary stages has yet to receive approval from the county though NextEra is expected to ask for a tax abatement or other incentives for bringing the project here.

NextEra officials are mum on several aspects of the proposal including who the farmers are so far who have agreed to lease their property for solar array panels or the exact location of where the panels will go other than to say it includes land on either side of Smoke Road.

They did confirm that around nine farmers have signed on so far with another few possibly agreeing to lease their land. They also declined to identify who the farmers who signed prospective leases are unless the names are released during a public meeting or how much revenue they can expect to receive.

“It’s right there along Smoke Road. That’s the meridian line” said Matt Johnson developer of the project for NextEra Energy adding 80% to 90% of the land has been secured through lease agreements at about 1800 acres with the possibility of an additional 160 to 800 acres.

“It’s safe to say we have a project in Porter County” added Zachary Melda development director for NextEra who is based in Juno Beach Florida the company headquarters.

Dunns Bridge Solar in Jasper County

NextEra on its company website touts itself as “the world leader in electricity generated from wind and solar” with $135 billion in total assets.

On a recent morning officials from NextEra and Northern Indiana Public Service Company which is harvesting the wattage generated by the Dunns Bridge project offered a tour of the Jasper County work in progress in Kankakee Township near Wheatfield visiting different parcels of land in varying stages of completion.

That included parcels with solar array panels fully installed and others that had only the metal racks upon which they connect all secured behind chain link fencing. NIPSCO’s R.M. Schahfer Generating Station which is being shut down was visible in the distance.

The Porter County project is expected to be similar in size and scope to the first phase of Dunns Bridge Solar which should be finished by May of next year. The second phase of that project which stretches into nearby Starke County is expected to be complete in December 2024.

“Jasper County was always in a different position than what the Malden project would be” said Stephen Eastridge executive director of the Jasper County Economic Development Organization.

The Schahfer Generating Station is being shut down in stages and is expected to be out of service around 2025 according to NIPSCO communications manager Tara McElmurry. Dunns Bridge Solar she said is just one of the utility’s projects as the company moves away from coal to renewable energy.

The generating station Eastridge said provided almost 20% of Jasper County’s tax base when he started his job there in 2017.

“That retirement was a really big blow to our local government bodies” he said. “We had real concerns about our tax base and tax rate jumps.”

And that’s where Dunns Bridge Solar comes in. The Indiana legislature sets the value of agricultural property at $1250 per acre where the solar panels are going in Eastridge said. That will go up considerably with solar.

“It’s about $13000 per acre once it’s put in solar use” he said.

The Jasper County Council according to minutes from a March 19 2019 meeting approved a declining seven-year tax abatement for the first phase of Dunns Bridge Solar. The abatement approved unanimously by the county council has the county abating $1.4 million from a tax bill of a little more than $2 million.

By the seventh year Eastridge said NextEra will be paying its full tax liability.

The project according to the meeting minutes is expected to generate $35 million for landowners over 30 years. The estimated tax benefit to the county is projected at $24.5 million on a $300 million solar investment. Estimated annual revenue for the Kankakee Valley School Corporation is $660000 annually with other taxing units in the county benefiting as well.

Renewable energy in general is a hot topic Eastridge said and the project hasn’t gone without its critics.

“The biggest thing we come back to is ‘How does this impact my life? What am I going to look at when I leave my driveway?'” he said adding that makes up about 90% of the concerns he hears in the community.

The project can’t be stopped on that Eastridge said adding he also hears what he calls rumors based on bad science about chemicals from the solar panels leaching into the ground. People also talk about the loss of farmland.

“My counter argument to that is at the end of the day if it didn’t make financial sense it wouldn’t happen” he said. “This is some of the least productive land we have in Jasper County.”

Additionally he said farmers can continue farming the rest of their acreage while reaping the financial benefits of solar income that can be spent on equipment farm outbuildings and the like and invested back into the local economy.

“No matter what your opinion of solar or renewables is people still want power to plug their phones in” Eastridge said.

If or when the time comes that solar energy is no longer viable he said the county’s tax base will be stable and diversified by then and the county won’t “run into the same kind of cliff” it did with the retirement of the generating station.

Malden Solar’s build out will take 12 to 18 months and create 250 construction jobs Johnson said adding that depending on the permitting process and timelines Malden Solar could begin operation at the end of 2024 but that could change.

“We’re still at 1% of the total farmland in Porter County” he said adding the project’s footprint of solar array panels and the fencing around them will be around 1200 acres.

The ground coverage ratio for the land under the panels will be at 35% to 40% he said adding the actual footprint will be about 750 acres “less than half of a percent of the farmland in the county.”

Malden Solar does not yet have an agreement to provide its energy to NIPSCO which sends out requests for proposals for renewable energy projects said Andy Campbell NIPSCO’s director of portfolio planning and origination.

“If it’s not valuable to us for some reason it could be valuable to someone else” he said.

The Malden Solar project Melda said is within a few months of going to the permit stage with Porter County depending on landowners and environmental surveys are already underway.

Detractors raise concerns

Not everyone sees a promise in solar energy.

Darren Grieger lives a few miles from the Malden Solar site in Morgan Township. He’s been farming corn beans and some livestock on the property for eight years. He took the farm over for his grandfather and his family has been farming on the same land for five or six generations.

He has “so many” concerns about the project he said including the infusion of government funds into green energy projects which he called “bad business.”

Additionally Grieger said solar farms reduce the amount of land available for farming which could lead to an increase in production costs. He also questioned how truly green the solar panels are from how they’re manufactured and shipped from China — officials from NextEra Energy said most of their panels come from Vietnam though some are made in the United States — and how they’re disposed of. NextEra officials said 95% of the materials in the panels can be recycled.

The panels Grieger said are behind fencing so “it’s not like animals can graze” on that land. And while officials touted how the panels can be recycled Grieger said solar energy is still a relatively new field and it could be cheaper to toss them in a landfill than to recycle them.

“It’s not going to be just Malden. It’s going to spread if this passes” Grieger said adding he doesn’t see any benefit to the solar farms.

“I think it’s a really inefficient way (to generate electricity) but it’s being pushed so hard by these solar companies because there’s so much government money behind it” he said.

He expects a “domino effect” of farmers leasing their land for solar panels lured by the promise of additional income and other farmers jumping aboard.

“Nobody wants to live next to it” he said.

Officials don’t always welcome solar farms either.

NextEra had proposed a solar farm dubbed Brickyard Solar for Zionsville in Boone County north of Indianapolis according to published media reports. The proposal for a 1200-acre solar farm straddled city limits into unincorporated Boone County thereby requiring approval from both city and county boards.

The city’s board of zoning appeals denied a special exception request for the solar array. The county’s advisory planning commission also rejected the proposal stating that it deviated from the county’s comprehensive plan which said the area was supposed to stay in traditional agricultural production. NextEra subsequently withdrew its proposal about a year ago.

Robert Thompson Porter County’s director of development and stormwater management said in an email that the county’s comprehensive plan “does not discuss clean or green energy solutions” and added that the plan was approved in 2002 but does not discuss that type of land use.

The county now has two small solar farms at around 10 acres each that produce about 1 megawatt each Thompson said. One of them is west of the Sedley Road bridge just south of Indiana 130 and the other is on Robbins Road adjacent to Portage city limits.

County officials expect that as is the case in Jasper County NextEra will request a financial incentive for any project here.

“Most Indiana counties have negotiated economic development agreements with the solar farm developers” Stu Summers a consultant working with Porter County as part of the team of county staff negotiating economic development agreements for solar farms said in an email.

“Typically the agreements require a bond to assure that at the end of the solar panels’ useful life the property will be returned to its original state allowing for renewed agricultural activities. Also counties have granted limited tax abatement in return for economic development payments from the solar farm operations.”

So far they have not reached an agreement Summers said but if they do it will require the approval of the Board of Commissioners and the County Council.

Nothing has been formally presented to the council for a tax abatement hearing Thompson said in an email. “There have been some very preliminary discussions on an economic package but nothing has been agreed upon as of yet or drafted up in an agreement format.”

‘A little bit of a gamble’

Sheafer the Jasper County farmer said he was approached around 2015 by Orion Renewables which came to the area to secure lease options for a solar project with the goal of putting the project together and selling it. The project was sold to NextEra Energy which is now developing it.

Sheafer who turns 60 next month has two adult children and neither is interested in farming. If they were he would have been less inclined to go into solar.

“The beauty of it is as we get older I don’t have to worry about weather because a percentage of our land won’t be cropped anymore” he said adding the returns on solar are roughly three times on average what he could make from farming the property.

While his property taxes will go up because of the added value of the land NextEra Energy will pay for any additional assessment beyond what Sheafer is paying now and will do so for the life of the lease agreement.

“There’s really no additional cost for us at all and I don’t have to put the crops out which is a lot of money” he said.

He understands folks who oppose taking their land out of farm production and homeowners against solar because of how it changes the view from their property.

“I get it. This is pretty to look at” he said sitting at his dining room table with his wife Anne and gazing out at his yard dotted with bird feeders and abutting alternating rows of corn and soybeans.

Both his traditional crops and his new one of solar panels capture the energy of the sun Sheafer said.

“It’s a little bit of a gamble” he said. “I hope we look back in 30 years and say ‘Yeah we’re glad we did this.'”

Ground zero in the conflict is Wyoming a stronghold for golden eagles that soar on 7-foot (2-meter) wings and a favored location for wind farms. As wind turbines proliferate scientists say deaths from collisions could drive down golden eagle numbers considered stable at best.

Yet climate change looms as a potentially greater threat: Rising temperatures are projected to reduce golden eagle breeding ranges by more than 40% later this century according to a National Audubon Society analysis.

That leaves golden eagles doubly vulnerable — to the shifting climate and to the wind energy promoted as a solution to that warming world.

""We have some of the best golden eagle populations in Wyoming but it doesn't mean the population is not at risk"" said Bryan Bedrosian conservation director at the Teton Raptor Center in Wilson Wyoming. ""As we increase wind development across the U.S. that risk is increasing.""

Turbine blades hundreds of feet long are among myriad threats to golden eagles which are routinely shot poisoned by lead hit by vehicles and electrocuted on power lines.

The tenuous position of golden eagles contrasts with the conservation success of their avian cousins bald eagles whose numbers have quadrupled since 2009. There are an estimated 346000 bald eagles in the U.S. versus about 40000 golden eagles which need much larger areas to survive and are more inclined to have trouble with humans.

Federal officials have tried to curb turbine deaths while avoiding any slowdown in the growth of wind power as an alternative to carbon-emitting fossil fuels — a key piece of President Joe Biden's climate agenda.

In April a Florida-based power company pleaded guilty in federal court in Wyoming to criminal violations of wildlife protection laws after its wind turbines killed more than 100 golden eagles in eight states. It was the third conviction of a major wind company for killing eagles in a decade.

Despite the deaths scientists like Bedrosian say more turbines are needed to fight climate change. He and colleague Charles Preston are finding ways wind companies can reduce or offset eagle deaths such as building in areas less frequented by the birds improving habitat elsewhere or retrofitting power poles to make them less perilous when eagles land.

""It's robbing Peter to pay Paul but it's a start and I think it's the way to go"" Preston said. ""It's a societal question: Is there room for them and us? It's not just golden eagles. They are kind of a window into the bigger picture.""

Dangling from a rope 30 feet (9 meters) above the ground with a canvas bag slung around his neck Bedrosian shouldered his way into a golden eagle nest lodged in a cliff ledge in northwestern Wyoming. As an adult eagle circled in the distance the scientist made an awkward grab for the young eagle in the nest slid a leather hood over its head then wrestled the bird into the bag.

The 6-week-old bird was lowered and carefully extracted by Preston a zip tie around its feet as a precaution against talons more than an inch long.

""The key is not to forget later to cut the zip tie"" Bedrosian said.

The eaglet went on a scale — about 7 pounds (3.2 kilograms). Bedrosian drew some blood from a wing to test for lead exposure and Preston clamped onto each leg a metal band with numbers for identification if the eagle's recaptured or found dead.

Golden eagles don't mate until about 5 years old and produce about one chick every two years so adult eagle deaths have outsized impacts on the population Bedrosian said.

Illegal shootings are the biggest cause of death killing about 700 golden eagles annually according to federal estimates. More than 600 die annually in collisions with cars wind turbines and power lines; about 500 annually are electrocuted and more than 400 are poisoned.

""Wind mortality wasn't a thing for golden eagles 10 years ago"" Bedrosian said. ""I don't want to pick on wind as the only thing. ... But it's the additive nature of all these things and several are increasing. Vehicle strikes are increasing. Climate change is increasing. Wind is increasing.""

Federal officials won't divulge how many eagles are reported killed by wind farms saying it's sensitive law enforcement information. The recent criminal prosecution of a subsidiary of NextEra Energy one of the largest U.S. renewable energy providers offered a glimpse into the problem's scope.

The company pleaded guilty to three counts of violating the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and was ordered to pay more than $8 million in fines and restitution after killing at least 150 eagles — including more than 100 goldens at wind farms in Wyoming California New Mexico North Dakota Colorado Michigan Arizona and Illinois.

Government officials said the mortality was likely higher because some turbines killed multiple eagles and carcasses are not always found.

Prosecutors said the company's failure to take steps to protect eagles or to obtain permits to kill the birds gave it an advantage over competitors that did take such steps — even as NextEra and affiliates received hundreds of millions of dollars in federal tax credits for wind power.

The company remained defiant after the plea deal: NextEra President Rebecca Kujawa said bird collisions with turbines were unavoidable accidents that should not be criminalized.

Utilities Duke Energy and PacifiCorp previously pleaded guilty to similar charges in Wyoming. North Carolina-based Duke Energy was sentenced in 2013 to $1 million in fines and restitution and five years probation following deaths of 14 golden eagles and 149 other birds at two of the company's wind projects.

A year later Oregon-based PacifiCorp received $2.5 million in fines and five years probation after 38 golden eagle carcasses and 336 other protected birds were discovered at two of its sites.

The number of wind turbines nationwide more than doubled over the past decade to almost 72000 according to U.S. Geological Survey data with development overlapping prime golden eagle territory in states including Wyoming Montana California Washington and Oregon.

USGS scientists concluded in a recent study that if anticipated growth in wind energy by 2040 occurs increased turbine-caused deaths could cut golden eagle populations by almost half over 10 years.

However the fact that no population-wide declines have been seen in recent years suggests some uncertainty in the projections. said lead author Jay Diffendorfer.

Federal wildlife officials are pushing wind companies to enroll in a permitting program that allows them to kill eagles if the deaths are offset.

Companies with permits can pay utilities to retrofit power poles so lines are spaced far enough that eagles can't be easily electrocuted. Every 11 poles retrofitted typically means one eagle death avoided annually.

Nationwide 34 permits in place last year authorized companies to ""take"" 170 golden eagles — meaning that many birds could be killed by turbines or lost through impacts on nests or habitat.

For each loss companies are responsible for ensuring at least one eagle death is avoided somewhere else. Using conservative estimates that overcount potential deaths could even mean a gain of eagles in the long run said Brian Millsap who heads the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's eagle program.

""This sounds crass but it's realistic. Eagles are going to be incidentally killed at wind farms"" he said. ""We've got to reduce other things that will allow wind energy development.""

Agency officials would not disclose which companies hold permits. An Associated Press public records review shows most are wind farms.

Federal officials collect golden eagle death data through an online reporting system used by government agencies companies scientists tribes and private groups.

Fish and Wildlife Service officials declined to release the data because they said it could be used in future law enforcement cases.

The nests where Bedrosian and Preston are doing population studies are about 60 miles (96 kilometers) from the nearest wind farm — 114 turbines that PacifiCorp began operating about two years ago near the Wyoming-Montana border.

Personnel on site scan the skies with binoculars for eagles and can shut down turbines when the birds approach.

""We tend to see more golden eagles in prairie areas where you're going to have the best wind regimes"" said Travis Brown a biologist with PacifiCorp. ""It's almost like competition for the wind resource because the birds are using it for movement.""

Ten PacifiCorp wind farms have permits authorizing the incidental killing of eagles and an application is pending for two more the company said.

Company representatives declined to say how many eagles have died under its federal permits. They said PacifiCorp's been building a ""bank"" of retrofitted power poles to offset eagle deaths and also wants to try new approaches such as painting turbine blades to be more visible and easier to avoid.

""We're working as hard as we can to avoid and minimize (deaths) up front and then anything we can't we're mitigating on the back end"" Brown said.",,,,,,

Nike sued Adidas in Oregon and at the US International Trade Commission (ITC) in December alleging several Adidas shoe designs infringe patents related to Nike’s lightweight Flyknit technology. The ITC began an investigation of Adidas’ shoes based on the complaint in January.

Adidas filed its own lawsuit in East Texas in June arguing Nike’s Adapt shoe-fitting technology Run Club and Training Club exercise apps and SNKRS app for limited-edition shoe sales all violate its patents.

The companies jointly asked the Oregon court to dismiss Nike’s lawsuit on Tuesday and asked the Texas court and ITC to drop their cases on Thursday.

All of the filings said the dispute had been settled. Details of the settlement were not immediately available and the companies and their attorneys did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Providing that the patient consents the virtual reality style headset can transcribe the appointment directly to electronic records reducing time-consuming admin for nurses.

Staff will have the ability to share live footage directly with hospital colleagues to get a second opinion avoiding the need for further appointments or hospital admission.

Community nurses are estimated to spend more than half of their day filling out forms and inputting patient data manually. The pilot will enable them to expand their capacity giving them more time for clinical tasks such as checking blood pressure dressing wounds and assessing patient’s relevant health needs.

The glasses also help nurses look up their next appointment that day and check how long it will take to get there based on live travel updates. The software used in the smart glasses dubbed A.Consult was developed by Concept Health.

Northern Lincolnshire and Goole NHS Foundation Trust will be trialling the techonology in August 2022.

Dr Tim Ferris NHS director for transformation said: “Some of the best innovations come from local solutions and so through this project NHS staff can test what works for them and what provides the best possible care for patients.

“These new smart glasses are the latest pioneering tech and really show us what the future of the NHS could look like – they are a win-win for staff and patients alike freeing up time consuming admin for nurses meaning more time for patient care.”

NHS England awarded the trust £400000 to test the technology as part of a wider innovation project which is set to fund a further 16 pilot projects over the coming months.

Local patients in Northern Lincolnshire and Goole will be informed about the project and asked if they consent for the technology to be used and their data to be recorded. If they agree patient data will be transferred securely to the electronic patient record (EPR) system.

Becky Birchall community tissue viability clinical nurse specialist at the trust said: “We’re excited to be the first team to try the smart glasses out and can’t wait to take them out on our community visits.

“We currently spend a considerable amount of time writing up our visits to patients and these cutting-edge glasses will really help to cut down the time we need to keep for admin supporting us to provide focussed patient care.

“The glasses have a thermal imaging feature which I think will be particularly useful for us when we are examining wounds and these features are going to really help us provide the best possible care for our patients.”

The pilot is one of 17 projects across 16 healthcare organisations to receive a share of £6million of the Digital PODAC Unified Tech Fund set by NHS England.

NASA issued the request for information (RFI) late Aug. 19 asking companies to supply information about how they could develop a spacecraft that would be used to perform the final reentry maneuvers at the end of the station’s life pushing it into the atmosphere to break up over the South Pacific Ocean.

Under a nominal deorbiting scenario provided by NASA in the RFI the spacecraft would attach to the forward port on the Node 2 module a year before reentry. During this time the station’s altitude would gradually decay from atmospheric drag and maneuvers from thrusters on the station’s Russian segment descending below 220 kilometers the altitude below which only thrusters can provide attitude control for the station.

The deorbit vehicle would first place the ISS into an elliptical orbit of 145 by 200 kilometers to minimize the period in which the station has to rely on thrusters for attitude control. It would then make a final burn to lower the perigee to 50 kilometers ensuring “atmospheric capture” or breakup of the station upon reentry.

NASA in an ISS transition plan published in January projected using Russian Progress cargo spacecraft for reentry. “NASA and its partners have evaluated varying quantities of Russian Progress spacecraft and determined that three can accomplish the de-orbit” the report stated. It added that Northrop Grumman’s Cygnus spacecraft which is capable of reboosting the station’s orbit has also been considered for deorbiting the station.

“In a years-long effort NASA and its partners have studied deorbit requirements and developed a strategy and action plan that evaluated the use of multiple Roscosmos Progress spacecraft to support deorbit operations” NASA said in a statement announcing the RFI. “These studies indicated additional spacecraft may provide more robust capabilities for deorbit and NASA has decided to assess U.S. industry’s ability to aid with safe deorbit of the complex.”

“NASA and our international partners are taking the prudent approach to the space station’s end of life planning to safely execute deorbit” Kathy Lueders NASA associate administrator for space operations said in the statement. “As part of our 2030 transition planning we are pursuing sufficient redundancy for the safety of the crew and people and structures on Earth. This also could be an important U.S. capability for future commercial destinations.”

NASA and the other ISS partners except for Russia have endorsed an extension of ISS operations from 2024 to 2030. Russian officials have said they plan to exit the ISS some time after 2024 but have not set a firm date. In the RFI NASA said the nominal scenario calls for deorbiting the ISS in early 2031 but that it could be delayed or moved up depending on the status of ISS operations.

“Although nominal ISS [end of life] is late 2030 the Government requires that this deorbit capability be available as soon as possible to protect for contingencies that could drive early re-entry and beyond 2030 in the event of further ISS mission extensions” the RFI stated. That includes the ability of launching the deorbit spacecraft as soon as six months before the final deorbit maneuvers.

In the RFI NASA asks industry for their technical capabilities to develop a deorbit module that meets its requirements as well as preferred contracting arrangements operational issues and extensibility of such a module to serve commercial space stations.

The Carson native headed to Hampton University at age 16 to study electrical engineering. She applied for a job as an administrative assistant and got hired as a design engineer with the rest of her tuition paid.

Her undergraduate degree turned out to be a B.A. in economics from CSULB but she later earned a master’s degree in systems engineering and a doctorate in organizational change and management. Givens rose to her position as vice president after two decades spent working in design and program management.

The CSULB alumni was among a number of industry professionals who helped introduce the 53 new members of the CSULB Beach Engineering Student Success Team (BESST) to the field of engineering during the Summer Academy this August. “Being an engineer you will never have to worry about work” she told them. “Never ever.”

Givens who is vice president of the OGS Business Unit overseeing payload and ground systems advised the students to follow their interests. “You should do what you really like” she said. “No matter where you start if you have a vision for what you want to do you can do it.”

After breezing through high school Givens was shocked when she failed Calculus on her first try. The experience was eye-opening. After that she enlisted tutors and learned how to study and ask for help. She advised the BESST students to take advantage of all the resources the program offers.

Other speakers included Dorothy Benveniste chair of COE’s 100+ Women Strong; Jason Deutschman associate director of the COE Engineering Student Success Center; Jasmine Garcia an industrial engineer with Abbott Labs; Kayla Rosario a project technical lead with Boeing; and Willy Rosner principal with Fulcrum Construction.

COE Dean Jinny Rhee Associate Dean of Academic Programs Antonella Sciortino and Director of Development Cheryl Ward also spoke to the incoming BESST tracks.

During the weeklong Summer Academy teams completed ice-breaker exercises heard about various engineering professions received math tutoring and toured the campus and library. A highlight of the week was off-campus tours to Romeo Power and the Port of Los Angeles.

At the closing ceremony COE Director of K-12 Outreach and Recruitment Saba Yohannes-Reda congratulated the students on completing their first week of the program despite some having plans for work or vacation. “I really admire your commitment” she said.

The Summer Academy kicked off the ninth year of the innovative year-long program which provides cohort-based classes a buddy system of past program graduates as peer mentors career-readiness support and guidance and intensive supplemental tutoring to help students pass crucial classes like Calculus.

Now imagine that scene taking place on a sandy beach near the ocean with a bunch of engineer space nerds.

Watermelon eating tug-of-war human pyramid and dodgeball. These are just a few competitions that are part of the annual Aerospace Games in Los Angeles where employees and interns from SpaceX Virgin Orbit Blue Origin Boeing and NASA—among many others—compete for trophies and glory.

In late July for the first time since before the Covid-19 pandemic the ""fun and family-friendly” games returned to Dockweiler Beach hosted by 2019 winner Northrop Grumman with ""30+ companies 6000+ attendees and ONE overall champion.” Hundreds of aerospace and Department of Defense workers are bused in donning colorful T-shirts with their respective employers' names plastered on the front.

Home bases were set up bright and early. Companies budgeted for boxed lunches and tables displayed satellite models and informational flyers. Walking alongside the tents Ernest Yeung a 42-year-old flight software engineer at Terran Orbital and a balloon toss competitor reminisces: “Look at all of these companies that I applied to that rejected me!” Obtaining his master's in theoretical physics in 2014 Yeung had pivoted his career from academia after being inspired by Richard Branson and Elon Musk. He taught himself programming while driving an Uber for a year handing out résumés at the SpaceX campus. Two years of applications later he received his first yes from Virgin Orbit. Pride still remains for his previous employer though he’s switched jobs and no longer competes in the relay races: “We were the third commercial space company to get to orbit after SpaceX and Rocket Lab.” The annual gathering at Dockweiler reminded him of his own journey.

“In a deep personal emotional way I knew what it was like being on the outside” he says. “For me I just feel like I made it. I’m part of this community.”

Winning involves strategy as one Reddit user posted in a 2016 thread: ""SpaceX came in first place overall after stacking their tug-of-war team with factory floor workers!"" The entire competition is based on a points allotment system where winners receive 40 total points with each team at second place and below earning fewer points in each game. Relay races have batting orders of sorts designed to ensure that no one would get tired and that time isn’t wasted on player transitions. Even with all of this strategy however the goal for many participants is not first place.

“People don't want to win first place because the first-place team has to plan next year’s Aerospace Games. So realistically you aim for second” says engineer Joan Marie Tubungbanua as she paints a red “JPL” stencil across a teammate’s face. For the past few years SpaceX and Northrop Grumman have alternated hosting duties. The 22-year-old NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) system engineer and University of Southern California masters student works on the Psyche mission to explore a metal-rich asteroid in orbit between Mars and Jupiter but today she was the wheel to the wheelbarrow duo in JPL’s lineup. Unfortunately this meant that she inhaled quite a bit of sand.

“We didn't expect the sand to be as deep as it is on the actual beach. And so we definitely had to adjust our strategy a little bit” chuckles Tubungbanua. Her teammate 19-year-old Kruti Bhingradiya a robotics intern at JPL and student from Gujarat points out that while corporate bonding games like cricket are prevalent in India the relay race in the United States was unique. “Yeah I’ve never seen baseball bats before.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VmbGlnaHRub3cuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMjEvcHJvcHVsc2lvbi1kZWFsLW9mZmVycy1ib29zdC1mb3Itc2NvdHRpc2gtaG9yaXpvbnRhbC1zcGFjZS1sYXVuY2hlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Propulsion deal offers boost for Scottish horizontal space launches – Spaceflight Now,"UK-based horizontal launch company Astraius says it’s on track for a first launch in spring 2024 from Prestwick Spaceport in Scotland after signing deals with two key suppliers for its innovative rocket.

Northrop Grumman is to supply first and second motors and Exquadrum will provide the upper-stage motor. Northrop Grumman’s Orion solid rocket motors will boost the Astraius launch vehicle after its extraction from an unmodified C-17 carrier aircraft while Exquadrum’s bespoke upper stage will place satellites in precise orbits.

The Astraius rocket with a payload capability of 800 kg to low Earth orbit (LEO) will ignite within seconds of being released via a parachute system on a cargo pallet from the back of the aircraft.

“It will be a bespoke Astraius launch vehicle” said Shane Clark vice president of the firm’s engineering and program division. “Our strategy is to minimise new development so essentially we have stitched together flight-proven components.

“This is a new launch vehicle but it’s not a brand new first stage it’s not a brand new second stage and it probably not a brand new faring or avionics system” he explained. “Most of the rocket’s components will already have flight pedigree which gives assurance to both customers and the insurance market.”

Huntsville Alabama-based Clark told Spaceflight Now that the global reach and flexibility of the C-17 military transporter aircraft would allow Astraius to offer an industry-leading capability for small satellite launches to LEO.

“We will not be confined to a spaceport or by the weather in the same way that vertical launchers are” he added. “With horizontal launch wherever that customer wants to go we will fly to that optimum launch point over water and put them into exactly the right inclination.

“If for example if you’re on the West Coast of California you cannot launch into an elliptical orbit because you can’t launch east. Conversely if you’re in Florida typically you’re not going to be able to get to a polar orbit.”

While launching a dozen rockets per year each carrying a 800 kg satellite would be an ideal scenario Clark said the prime market would most likley be for the launch of cubesats in a wide variety of different configurations either for single or multiple customers.

Announcing the tie up with Northrop Grumman and Exquadrum at last month’s Farnborough International Airshow Astraius chairman Sir George Zambellas said: “This is a hugely exciting moment for Astraius. We have a winning combination of proven launch and propulsion systems paired with exquisite rocket motor technology to produce a world-class capability.”

Kevin Mahaffy CEO of Exquadrum said: “We are excited to be part of the outstanding team that Astraius has put together to bring their unique horizontal launch vehicle to market. Exquadrum’s controllable solid rocket motor technology with its throttlability and precise termination ability is an excellent fit for Astraius’ upper stage application.”

Astraius is building two cleanrooms at Prestwick Spaceport’s new £23 million facility meaning two rockets and their payloads can be processed simultaneously giving the option of flying a second mission within hours of the first.

Astraius will base its launch and range operations in the UK at Scotland’s Prestwick Spaceport which will provide all necessary ground-based requirements in bespoke state-of-the-art facilities under an agreement signed in September 2021.

The Boeing C-17 Globemaster aircraft was developed for the United States Air Force (USAF) from the 1980s to the early 1990s by McDonnell Douglas.

Wrestling -- and a lot of it -- is the obvious appeal. AEW (All Elite Wrestling) is the onboard promoter and competitions will take place every day. Imagine a huge wrestling ring with awesome sight lines in the middle of a pool deck; reviews of the first cruise praised the intimacy of it all. Beyond wrestling the Ship of Jericho boasts a lineup of hard rock blues and metal bands starting with Jericho's own group Fozzy. (Fun fact: Jericho was inspired to do the first Rager at Sea after he played with his band on the KISS Kruise). Other bands include 80s favorite Quiet Riot Royal Bliss and Raven as well as others. Comedian Brad Williams will be the ""master of laughs.""

Several podcasts will be taped onboard including Jericho's own ""Talk is Jericho.""

Cayamo draws many repeat cruisers so if you're interested it's best to sign up for the pre-sale as cabins begin booking long before the lineup is announced.

General Info for Cayamo 2023

The weeklong full-charter cruise sails roundtrip from Miami February 10 to 17 2023. As part of the voyage 2394-passenger Norwegian Pearl will visit St. Maarten and Tortola.

Scoring a cabin on Cayamo is tough especially if you're a newbie. Guests from Cayamo 2022 are automatically included in the pre-sale and get first priority to book. Then bookings open for Cayamo alumni people who were placed on the most recent cruise waiting list and those who had to cancel. The last group to get pre-sale preference is new Cayamo guests. The cruise then opens to the general public for booking.

Lineup and Highlights for Cayamo 2023

The Cayamo lineup for 2023 includes a mix of folk rock alternative country bluegrass and blues artists that have made the at-sea festival a draw for more than a decade.

Listed artists include Jeff Tweedy Andrew Bird Trampled by Turtles the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band Neko Case Shovels & Rope and much more.

Cayamo is strong because of the sheer volume of performers -- many of which have small but dedicated followings -- as opposed to one star band. It's fairly common for musicians to drop in on each other's sets. Sixthman has also partnered with Black Opry to bring more diversity to the offerings.

Concerts are the main entertainment onboard but the Cayamo cruise also has special experiences for passengers such as beer tastings songwriting sessions open jams live interviews autograph signings and more.

Onboard Vibe of Cayamo 2023

The onboard vibe is mellow and fun. Cayamo draws mostly cruisers in the Baby Boomer age range who are past the hard-rocking stage of life. Expect to see people listening to music while lying down in their pool chairs as opposed to crowding the stage. Midnight jam sessions are common and they can go late but after-parties aren't necessarily packed. You're almost sure to hear some Grateful Dead covers.

Who Would Like Cayamo 2023

This sailing is ideal for American music lovers and acoustic guitar fans who like a variety of genres and are also drawn to the idea of joining a ""music family."" Many cruisers cite the friends they've made over repeated Cayamo voyages as part of the draw.

How to Book Cayamo 2023

This cruise is run by Sixthman a theme cruise operator owned by Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. Bookings are done via the Cayamo website. The 2023 cruise still seems to have space as of August 2022 but act fast -- they won't last long.

Nvidia has long been the dominant player in the graphics card market but the company has from time to time been put under serious pressure by its main rival AMD which has launched several of its own iconic GPUs. Those only set Nvidia up for a major comeback however and sometimes that led to a real game-changing card.

It was hard to choose which Nvidia GPUs were truly worthy of being called the best of all time but I’ve narrowed down the list to six cards that were truly important and made history.

GeForce 256

The very first

Although Nvidia often claims the GeForce 256 was the world’s first GPU that’s only true if Nvidia is the only company that gets to define what a GPU is. Before GeForce there were the RIVA series of graphics cards and there were other companies making their own competing graphics cards then too. What Nvidia really invented was the marketing of graphics cards as GPUs because in 1999 when the 256 came out terms like graphics card and graphics chipset were more common.

Nvidia is right that the 256 was important however. Before the 256 the CPU played a very important role in rendering graphics to the point where the CPU was directly completing steps in rendering a 3D environment. However CPUs were not very efficient at doing this which is where the 256 came in with hardware transforming and lighting offloading the two most CPU intensive parts of rendering onto the GPU. This is one of the primary reasons why Nvidia claims this is the first GPU.

As a product the GeForce 256 wasn’t exactly legendary: Anandtech wasn’t super impressed by its price for the performance at the time of its release. Part of the problem was the 256’s memory which was single data rate or SDR. Due to other advances SDR was becoming insufficient for GPUs of this performance level. A faster dual data rate or DDR (the same DDR as in DDR5) launched just before the end of 1999 which finally met Anandtech’s expectations for performance but the increased price tag of the DDR version was hard to swallow.

The GeForce 256 first of its name is certainly historical but not because it was an amazing product. The 256 is important because it inaugurated the modern era of GPUs. The graphics card market wasn’t always a duopoly; back in the 90s there were multiple companies competing against each other with Nvidia being just one of them. Soon after the GeForce 256 launched most of Nvidia’s rivals exited the market. 3dfx’s Voodoo 5 GPUs were uncompetitive and before it went bankrupt many of its technologies were bought by Nvidia; Matrox simply quit gaming GPUs altogether to focus on professional graphics.

By the end of 2000 the only other graphics company in town was ATI. When AMD acquired ATI in 2006 it brought about the modern Nvidia and AMD rivalry we all know today.

GeForce 8800 GTX

A monumental leap forward

After the GeForce 256 Nvidia and ATI attempted to best the other with newer GPUs with higher performance. In 2002 however ATI threw down the gauntlet by launching its Radeon 9000 series and at a die size of 200mm squared the flagship Radeon 9800 XT was easily the largest GPU ever. Nvidia’s flagship GeForce4 Ti 4600 at 100mm had no hope of beating even the midrange 9700 Pro which inflicted a crushing defeat on Nvidia. Making a GPU was no longer just about the architecture the memory or the drivers; in order to win Nvidia would need to make big GPUs like ATI.

For the next four years the size of flagship GPUs continued to increase and by 2005 both companies had launched a GPU that was around 300mm. Although Nvidia had regained the upper hand during this time ATI was never far behind and its Radeon X1000 series was fairly competitive. A GPU sized at 300mm was far from the limit of what Nvidia could do however. In 2006 Nvidia released its GeForce 8 series led by the flagship 8800 GTX. Its GPU codenamed G80 was nearly 500mm and its transistor count was almost three times higher than the last GeForce flagship.

The 8800 GTX did to ATI what the Radeon 9700 Pro and the rest of the 9000 series did to Nvidia with Anandtech describing the moment as “9700 Pro-like.” A single 8800 GTX was almost twice as fast as ATI’s top-end X1950 XTX not to mention much more efficient. At $599 the 8800 GTX was more expensive than its predecessors but its high level of performance and DirectX 10 support made up for it.

But this was mostly the end of the big GPU arms race that had characterized the early 2000s for two main reasons. Firstly 500mm was getting pretty close to the limit of how large a GPU could be and even today 500mm is relatively big for a processor. Even if Nvidia wanted to making a bigger GPU just wasn’t feasible. Secondly ATI wasn’t working on its own 500mm GPU anyway so Nvidia wasn’t in a rush to get an even bigger GPU to market. Nvidia had basically won the arms race by outspending ATI.

That year also saw the acquisition of ATI by AMD which was finalized just before the 8800 GTX launched. Although ATI now had the backing of AMD it really seemed like Nvidia had such a massive lead that Radeon wouldn’t challenge GeForce for a long time perhaps never again.

GeForce GTX 680

Beating AMD at its own game

Nvidia’s next landmark release came in 2008 when it launched the GTX 200 series starting with the GTX 280 and GTX 260. At nearly 600mm squared the 280 was a worthy monstrous successor to the 8800 GTX. Meanwhile AMD and ATI signaled that they would no longer be launching high-end GPUs with big dies in order to compete rather focusing on making smaller GPUs in a gambit known as the small die strategy. In its review Anandtech said “Nvidia will be left all alone with top performance for the foreseeable future.” As it turned out the next four years were pretty rough for Nvidia.

Starting with the HD 4000 series in 2008 AMD assaulted Nvidia with small GPUs that had high value and almost flagship levels of performance and that dynamic was maintained throughout the next few generations. Nvidia’s GTX 280 wasn’t cost effective enough then the GTX 400 series was delayed and the 500 series was too hot and power hungry.

One of Nvidia’s traditional weaknesses was its disadvantage when it came to process the way processors are manufactured. Nvidia was usually behind AMD but it had finally caught up by using the 40nm node for the 400 series. AMD however wanted to regain the process lead quickly and decided its next generation would be on the new 28nm node and Nvidia decided to follow suit.

AMD won the race to 28nm with its HD 7000 series with its flagship HD 7970 putting AMD back in first place for performance. However the GTX 680 launched just two months later and not only did it beat the 7970 in performance but also power efficiency and even die size. As Anandtech put it Nvidia had “landed the technical trifecta” and that completely flipped the tables on AMD. AMD did reclaim the performance crown yet again by launching the HD 7970 GHz Edition later in 2012 (notable for being the first 1GHz GPU) but having the lead in efficiency and performance per millimeter was a good sign for Nvidia.

The back and forth battle between Nvidia and AMD was pretty exciting after how disappointing the GTX 400 and 500 series had been and while the 680 wasn’t an 8800 GTX it signaled Nvidia’s return to being truly competitive against AMD. Perhaps most importantly Nvidia was no longer weighed down by its traditional process disadvantage and that would eventually pay off in a big way.

GeForce GTX 980

Nvidia’s dominance begins

Nvidia found itself in a very good spot with the GTX 600 series and it was because of TSMC’s 28nm process. Under normal circumstances AMD would have simply gone to TSMC’s next process in order to regain its traditional advantage but this was no longer an option. TSMC and all other foundries in the world (except for Intel) had an extraordinary amount of difficulty progressing beyond the 28nm node. New technologies were needed in order to progress further which meant Nvidia didn’t have to worry about AMD regaining the process lead any time soon.

Following a few years of back and forth and AMD floundering with limited funds Nvidia launched the GTX 900 series in 2014 inaugurated by the GTX 980. Based on the new Maxwell architecture it was an incredible improvement over the GTX 600 and 700 series despite being on the same node. The 980 was between 30% and 40% faster than the 780 while consuming less power and it was even a smidge faster than the top-end 780 Ti. Of course the 980 also beat the R9 290X once again landing the trifecta of performance power efficiency and die size. In its review Anandtech said the 980 came “very very close to doing to the Radeon 290X what the GTX 680 did to Radeon HD 7970.”

AMD was incapable of responding. It didn’t have a next-generation GPU ready to launch in 2014. In fact AMD wasn’t even working on a complete lineup of brand-new GPUs to even the score with Nvidia. AMD instead was planning on rebranding the Radeon 200 series as the Radeon 300 series and would develop one new GPU to serve as the flagship. All of these GPUs were to launch in mid 2015 giving the entire GPU market to Nvidia for nearly a full year. Of course Nvidia wanted to pull the rug right from under AMD and prepared a brand-new flagship.

Launching in mid 2015 the GTX 980 Ti was about 30% faster than the GTX 980 thanks to its significantly higher power consumption and larger die size at just over 600mm squared. It beat AMD’s brand-new R9 Fury X a month before it even launched. Although the Fury X wasn’t bad it had lower performance than the 980 Ti higher power consumption and much less VRAM. It was a demonstration of how far ahead Nvidia was with the 900 series; while AMD was hastily trying to get the Fury X out the door Nvidia could have launched the 980 Ti any time it wanted.

Anandtech put it pretty well: “The fact that they get so close only to be outmaneuvered by Nvidia once again makes the current situation all the more painful; it’s one thing to lose to Nvidia by feet but to lose by inches only reminds you of just how close they got how they almost upset Nvidia.”

Nvidia was basically a year ahead of AMD technologically and while what they had done with the GTX 900 series was impressive it was also a bit depressing. People wanted to see Nvidia and AMD duke it out like they had done in 2012 and 2013 but it started to look like that was all in the past. Nvidia’s next GPU would certainly reaffirm that feeling.

GeForce GTX 1080

The GPU with no competition but itself

In 2015 TSMC had finally completed the 16nm process which could achieve 40% higher clock speeds than 28nm at the same power or half the power of 28nm at similar clock speeds. However Nvidia planned to move to 16nm in 2016 when the node was more mature. Meanwhile AMD had absolutely no plans to utilize TSMC’s 16nm but instead moved to launch new GPUs and CPUs on GlobalFoundries’s 14nm process. But don’t be fooled by the names: TSMC’s 16nm was and is better than GlobalFoundries’s 14nm. After 28nm nomenclature for processes became based in marketing rather than scientific measurements. This meant that for the first time in modern GPU history Nvidia had the process advantage against AMD.

The GTX 10-series launched in mid-2016 based on the new Pascal architecture and TSMC’s 16nm node. Pascal wasn’t actually very different from Maxwell but the jump from 28nm to 16nm was massive like Intel going from 14nm on Skylake to 10nm on Alder Lake. The GTX 1080 was the new flagship and it’s hard to overstate how fast it was. The GTX 980 was a little faster than the GTX 780 Ti when it came out. By contrast the GTX 1080 was over 30% faster than the GTX 980 Ti and for $50 less too. The die size of the 1080 was also extremely impressive at just over 300mm squared nearly half the size of the 980 Ti.

With the 1080 and the rest of the 10-series lineup Nvidia effectively took the entire desktop GPU market for itself. AMD’s 300 series and the Fury X were simply no match. At the midrange AMD launched the RX 400 series but these were just three low to mid-range GPUs that were a throwback to the small die strategy minus the part where Nvidia’s flagship was in striking distance like with the GTX 280 and the HD 4870. In fact the 1080 was nearly twice as fast as the RX 480. The only GPU AMD could really beat was the mid-range GTX 1060 as the slightly cut down GTX 1070 was just a little too fast to lose to the Fury X.

AMD did eventually launch new high-end GPUs in the form of RX Vega a full year after the 1080 came out. With much higher power consumption and the same selling price the flagship RX Vega 64 beat the GTX 1080 by a hair but wasn’t very competitive. However the GTX 1080 was no longer Nvidia’s flagship; with relatively small die size and a full year to prepare Nvidia launched a brand-new flagship a whole three months before RX Vega even launched; it was a repeat of the 980 Ti. The new GTX 1080 Ti was even faster than the GTX 1080 delivering yet another 30% improvement to performance. As Anandtech put it the 1080 Ti “further solidifie[d] Nvidia’s dominance of the high-end video card market.”

AMD’s failure to deliver a truly competitive high-end GPU meant that the 1080’s only real competition was Nvidia’s own GTX 1080 Ti. With the 1080 and the 1080 Ti Nvidia achieved what is perhaps the most complete victory we’ve seen so far in modern GPU history. Over the past 4 years Nvidia kept increasing its technological advantage over AMD and it was hard to see how Nvidia could ever lose.

GeForce RTX 3080

Correcting course

After such a long and incredible streak of wins perhaps it was inevitable that Nvidia would succumb to hubris and lose sight of what made Nvidia’s great GPUs so great. Nvidia did not follow up the GTX 10 series with yet another GPU with a stunning increase in performance but with the infamous RTX 20 series. Perhaps in a move to cut AMD out of the GPU market Nvidia focused on introducing hardware accelerated ray tracing and A.I. upscaling instead of delivering better performance in general. If successful Nvidia could make AMD GPUs irrelevant until the company finally made Radeon GPUs with built-in ray tracing.

RTX 20-series was a bit of a flop. When the RTX 2080 and 2080 Ti launched in late 2018 there weren’t even any games that supported ray tracing or deep learning super sampling (DLSS). But Nvidia priced RTX 20-series cards as if those features made all the difference. At $699 the 2080 had a nonsensical price and the 2080 Ti’s $1199 price tag was even more insane. Nvidia wasn’t even competing with itself anymore.

The performance improvement in existing titles was extremely disappointing too; the RTX 2080 was only 11% faster than the GTX 1080 though at least the RTX 2080 Ti was around 30% faster than the GTX 1080 Ti.

The next two years were a course correction for Nvidia. The threat from AMD was starting to become pretty serious; the company had finally regained the process advantage by moving to TSMC’s 7nm and the company launched the RX 5700 XT in mid-2019. Nvidia was able to head it off once again by launching new GPUs this time the RTX 20 Super series with a focus on value but the 5700 XT must have worried Nvidia. The RTX 2080 Ti was three times as large yet was only 50% faster meaning AMD was achieving much higher performance per millimeter. If AMD made a larger GPU it could be difficult to beat.

Both Nvidia and AMD planned for a big showdown in 2020. Nvidia recognized AMD’s potential and pulled out all the stops: the new 8nm process from Samsung the new Ampere architecture and an emphasis on big GPUs. AMD meanwhile stayed on TSMC’s 7nm process but introduced the new RDNA 2 architecture and would also be launching a big GPU its first since RX Vega in 2017. The last time both companies launched brand-new flagships within the same year was 2013 nearly a decade ago. Though the pandemic threatened to ruin the plans of both companies neither company was willing to delay the next generation and launched as planned.

Nvidia fired first with the RTX 30-series led by the flagship RTX 3090 but most of the focus was on the RTX 3080 since at $699 it was far more affordable than the $1499 3090. Instead of being a repeat of the RTX 20-series the 3080 delivered a sizeable 30% bump in performance at 4K over the RTX 2080 Ti though the power consumption was a little high. At lower resolutions the performance gain of the 3080 was somewhat less but since the 3080 was very capable at 4K it was easy to overlook this. The 3080 also benefitted from a wider variety of games supporting ray tracing and DLSS giving value to having an Nvidia GPU with those features.

Of course this wouldn’t matter if the 3080 and the rest of the RTX 30-series couldn’t stand up to AMD’s new RX 6000 series which launched two months later. At $649 the RX 6800 XT was AMD’s answer to the RTX 3080. With nearly identical performance in most games and at most resolutions the battle between the 3080 and the 6800 XT was reminiscent of the GTX 680 and the HD 7970. Each company had its advantages and disadvantages with AMD leading in power efficiency and performance while Nvidia had better performance in ray tracing and support for other features like A.I. upscaling.

The excitement over a new episode in the GPU war quickly died out though because it quickly came apparent that nobody could buy RTX 30 or RX 6000 or even any GPUs at all. The pandemic had seriously reduced supply while crypto increased demand and scalpers snatched up as many GPUs as they could. At the time of writing the shortage has mostly ended but most Nvidia GPUs are still selling for usually $100 or more over MSRP. Thankfully higher-end GPUs like the RTX 3080 can be found closer to MSRP than lower-end 30 series cards which keeps the 3080 a viable option.

On the whole the RTX 3080 was a much-needed correction from Nvidia. Although the 3080 has marked the end of Nvidia’s near total domination of the desktop GPU market it’s hard not to give the company credit for not losing to AMD. After all the RX 6000 series is on a much better process and AMD has been extremely aggressive these past few years. And besides it’s good to finally see a close race between Nvidia and AMD where both sides are trying really hard to win.

So what’s next?

Unlike AMD Nvidia always keeps its cards close to its chest and rarely ever reveals information on upcoming products. We can be pretty confident the upcoming RTX 40 series will launch sometime this year but everything else is uncertain. One of the more interesting rumors is that Nvidia will utilize TSMC’s 5nm for RTX 40 GPUs and if this is true then that means Nvidia will have parity with AMD once again.

But I think that as long as RTX 40 isn’t another RTX 20 and provides more low-end and mid-range options than RTX 30 Nvidia should have a good enough product next generation. I would really like for it to be so good that it makes the list of best Nvidia GPUs of all time but we’ll have to wait and see.

Occidental’s share price soared 9.9% closing up $6.41 at $71.29 after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) said letting Berkshire add to its 20.2% stake was “consistent with the public interest.”

Berkshire had applied to increase its stake on July 11 saying it would not hurt competition undermine regulatory authority or boost costs for consumers. FERC regulates the interstate transmission of electricity natural gas and oil.

The share price of Houston-based Occidental has more than doubled this year benefiting from rising oil prices following Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. Berkshire began buying Occidental shares four days later.

Buffett’s Omaha Nebraska-based conglomerate also owns $10 billion of Occidental preferred stock which helped finance the 2019 purchase of Anadarko Petroleum Corp and has warrants to buy another 83.9 million common shares for $5 billion.

Berkshire also ended June with a $23.7 billion stake in a larger oil company Chevron (CVX).

“Buffett is taking advantage of stock market participants who are foolish about the oil and gas industry and consider it a dead business” said Cole Smead president of Smead Capital Management Inc in Phoenix which owns Occidental and Berkshire shares. “Buffett thinks it can make him wealthy.”

Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent to Buffett’s assistant.

Occidental spokesman Eric Moses said the higher ownership limit was “necessary” because the company owned assets subject to FERC regulation. It said the prior limit was 25%.

FERC’s authorization does not require Berkshire to buy any Occidental shares.

Some investors and analysts have nonetheless said Berkshire could eventually buy Occidental diversifying an energy portfolio that includes several utilities electricity distributors and renewable power projects including wind.

Buffett completed one of his biggest acquisitions the $26.5 billion purchase of the BNSF railroad in 2010 after Berkshire had amassed a 22.6% stake.

Takeover?

Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he “liked Occidental more as a wholly-owned subsidiary under the Berkshire umbrella” because it would reduce Occidental’s costs to access capital and reduce exposure to commodity markets volatility.

Independent oil analyst Paul Sankey added that Occidental can benefit from the expanded tax credit for carbon-capture projects included in the Inflation Reduction Act signed this month by President Joe Biden.

“I can see him taking the whole thing private” Sankey said referring to Buffett.

Smead in contrast said Buffett is unlikely to buy all of Occidental soon and can instead buy more shares on the open market at lower prices than in a full takeover.

“In the long run he may but you don’t file something like this with FERC if you’re planning it in the next six months” Smead said.

Berkshire ended June with $105.4 billion of cash and equivalents even after buying a net $45.2 billion of stocks in the year’s first half.

Buffett has pledged to keep $30 billion on hand. Occidental’s market value was about $66 billion after Friday’s run-up.

Berkshire owns more than 90 companies outright including Geico car insurance See’s Candies Dairy Queen ice cream and several manufacturing businesses.

At Berkshire’s annual meeting on April 30 Buffett said he began buying Occidental shares after reviewing an analyst presentation.

He also expressed confidence in Chief Executive Vicki Hollub who has been reducing Occidental’s debt.

“She says she doesn’t know the price of oil next year. Nobody does” Buffett said. “But we decided it made sense.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbWFya2V0cy9zdG9ja3MvbmV3cy9oZXJlcy13aHktd2FycmVuLWJ1ZmZldHQtbG92ZXMtb2lsLWdpYW50LW9jY2lkZW50YWwtcGV0cm9sZXVtL2FydGljbGVzaG93LzkzNjc1ODg0LmNtc9IBigFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbWFya2V0cy9zdG9ja3MvbmV3cy9oZXJlcy13aHktd2FycmVuLWJ1ZmZldHQtbG92ZXMtb2lsLWdpYW50LW9jY2lkZW50YWwtcGV0cm9sZXVtL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85MzY3NTg4NC5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here’s why Warren Buffett loves oil giant Occidental Petroleum,"Oil

CEO

Inflation Reduction Act









Famed investor Warren Buffett is steadily snowballing a stake in Occidental Petroleum Corp. in what could end up being his biggest-ever acquisition. His Berkshire Hathaway Inc. on Friday won approval to buy as much as 50% of the shares. Some investors believe it’s a step toward a full takeover which may end up costing more than $50 billion.Here’s why Occidental is attractive to Berkshire:Inflation looks to be the mega-trend for the first half of the 2020s and crude oil is one of the best natural hedges out there. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and a lack of investment in new oilfields over the past five years have hit supplies leading to stagnant production profiles everywhere from OPEC to US shale. Meanwhile demand for fossil fuels has been strong coming out of the pandemic even as governments push for a switch to clean energy.With investments across the energy sector from utilities to solar power Buffett claims to be a realist in the debate around fossil fuels. “People that are on the extremes of both sides are a little nuts” he said at a Berkshire shareholder meeting in 2021.Buffett first invested in Occidental in 2019 when the oil company was in a bidding war with Chevron Corp. to buy its crosstown Houston rival Anadarko. Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub flew to Omaha Nebraska on the company’s Gulfstream V and convinced Buffett to add $10 billion to her war chest. It was enough to swing the deal and Chevron pulled out soon after. In exchange Buffett got preferred shares yielding 8% annually plus warrants to buy more common stock at $59.62 apiece. Today with Occidental at $71.29 those warrants would turn a profit of more than $900 million if exercised.Initially the Anadarko deal was a disaster because it loaded up Occidental’s balance sheet with more than $30 billion of additional debt right before the pandemic. Occidental’s market value went from $50 billion before the 2019 transaction to less than $9 billion toward the end of 2020 as oil prices crashed.But on the flip side this created a good value play for Buffett. When crude turned around late last year and was supercharged by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine Occidental was best-placed to benefit. The stock is the best performer in the S&P 500 this year up more than 140% compared with the index’s 11% decline.“Oxy started this year heavily indebted with massive oil exposure” said Bill Smead who manages $4.8 billion at Smead Capital Management Inc. and is a top 20 shareholder in Occidental. Soaring crude prices mean “they’re now paying off that debt and gushing cash. It’s the best of all worlds.”Too much cash has been Berkshire’s biggest investing challenge over the past few years. The conglomerate had about $105 billion on hand at the end of June. It is expected to generate about $8 billion in free cash flow each quarter for the next five years according to Greggory Warren of Morningstar Research Services LLC. Inflation at the highest in 40 years is a great incentive to put that money to work.Occidental would work better as a subsidiary of Berkshire than a stock holding “given the volatility that exists in the energy/commodity markets” Warren said. “This could end up though evolving into a slow-motion takeover where Berkshire buys up to the stakes that FERC allows it to acquire until it can acquire Oxy whole.”Occidental is not only one of the biggest producers in the Permian Basin the largest US oilfield but it also has one of the lowest costs with an oil price of just $40 a barrel needed to sustain its dividend. West Texas Intermediate currently trades at about $90 a barrel. Hollub has reined in the “drill-baby-drill” mentality that characterized shale for the first decade of its lifespan and is now prioritizing profits over production. Free cash flow hit a record $4.2 billion in the second quarter.The Anadarko purchase may have been expensive but it allowed Occidental to lift its land holdings in the Permian to 2.8 million acres 14 times the size of New York City’s five boroughs combined. It also added steady cash-flowing assets in the Gulf of Mexico and Algeria.Buffett has a good personal relationship with Hollub which began at the 2019 meeting in Omaha brokered by Bank of America Corp. CEO Brian Moynihan. This year the veteran investor praised Hollub after reading a transcript of Occidental’s Feb. 25 earnings conference call in which she pledged financial discipline even as oil prices were rising.“I read every word and said this is exactly what I would be doing” Buffett told CNBC’s Becky Quick in “Squawk Box” in March. “She’s running the company the right way.”The oil industry mostly criticized the Inflation Reduction Act that President Joe Biden signed into law this month. The $437 billion legislation “discourages needed investment in oil and gas” and offers “the wrong policies at the wrong time” the American Petroleum Institute said.But Hollub was surprisingly upbeat calling the bill “very positive.” That may have something to do with its expansion of tax credits for carbon capture of which Occidental is a leading proponent. The company has plans to build the world’s biggest direct air capture plant which will command a tax credit of as much as $180 for each ton of carbon sucked out of the air.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vY3BpLXBvc3RzL3JlZ3VsYXRvci1va3MtYnVmZmV0dHMtYmVya3NoaXJlLWhhdGhhd2F5LW9jY2lkZW50YWwtc3Rha2UtYnV5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Regulator OKs Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Occidental Stake Buy,"A US energy regulator on Friday gave Berkshire Hathaway the company controlled by billionaire Warren Buffett permission to buy up to 50% of oil company Occidental Petroleum’s common stock.

He is preceded in death by his father Nick Durney Sr. survived by his daughter Ilana mother Penny his sister Kim and a long list of uncles aunts and cousins.

Born and raised in VA Beach to Nick and Penny Durney. Nick graduated and wrestled with Kempsville High School where his team went on to win the State Championship. Nick graduated from Old Dominion University with a Bachelor’s Degree in Marketing. We knew Nick was intelligent at a very young age when he was accelerated into the gifted program in elementary school and played the violin. Nick was exceptional with numbers and stats. He was talented and could do anything he set his mind to. He had a knack for sales finance and helping people. He followed in his father’s footsteps and sold cars for 14 yrs. at Mike Duman Auto Sales. For the past 3 yrs. he was an EMT for Sentra and an Enrollment specialist at Optima Health.

Nick was a sports enthusiast he was a great wrestler loved surfing and being on the beach with his family playing golf poker and most of all watching football. He was a super Steelers fan it all started when he was a kid playing flag football and his team was named the Steelers. The Steelers were in the super bowl that year and his loyalty to that team is history. This time of year he would start getting all the stats talking to all his friends to get his fantasy football team lined up. He loved the game and enjoyed the competition.

Nick had a passion for music of all kinds he was open to listen to anything that made him feel good and vibe. Nick was always looking for the next concert and festival to go to or dance floor to boogie on. He was a special human and could connect to anyone through music and did. He met so many people through the years that he touched with his open and generous soul.

Nick would say his greatest accomplishment is his daughter Ilana. He loved her more than anything in this world. He raised her on his own for most of her life and was making plans to change careers to go be with her in Sarasota. He was looking forward to this next chapter with her. Nick will be missed by many and all he touched he had a zest for life and a good time. Most of all Nick had a big heart and was always there with a helping hand.

If you were lucky enough to be one of Nick’s friends you have that bond that will be cherished forever.

And head coach Marcus Freeman feels great about Mason’s track record of pressuring opposing punters when the two worked together at the University of Cincinnati. UC in the four seasons (2018-21) that Mason presided over its special teams blocked nine punts and 14 kicks including a nation’s-best six of the latter in 2021 tied with Houston and Old Dominion. The Bearcats’ total of 23 total blocks is 15 more than the Irish accomplished (four punt blocks four blocked kicks) over the same time span under Brian Kelly/Brian Polian now both at LSU.

“We’re gonna play defense and just run pressures and be aggressive and try to affect the punter” Mason said. “And once the punter’s getting rid of the ball really fast and we’ve affected him we’ll go into different looks and different hold-ups and things like that like most people would do. “But the No. 1 goal is to affect the punter just like you want to affect the quarterback. The faster we can make him get rid of the ball the higher probability he shanks it the higher probability there’s less hangtime and we can get more return yards. “And punters don’t handle pressure that well because most teams don’t pressure.” Mason is just about through his preseason special teams checklist with determining who will handle onside kicks and who will be on the “hands team” dealing with opposing onside kicks as the final couple of tasks. The No. 1 place-kicker (Arkansas State transfer Blake Grupe) punter (Harvard transfer Jon Sot) holder (Sot) and kickoff man (freshman punter Bryce McFerson) have all locked down specialist positions that were open after last season. “It took about five minutes” Mason said of McFerson’s claim on the kickoffs job. “Some of those guys you just know.” Grad senior Michael “Milk” Vinson at long snapper is the only incumbent among the specialists. The former walk-on is in his third year as a starter. ND didn’t make the top 30 nationally in 2021 in any team special teams statistical category. Cincinnati under Mason was in the top 30 in all seven of them: Punt returns (29th) punt coverage (3rd) kickoff returns (25th) kickoff coverage (24th) net punting (22nd) blocked punts (7th) and blocked kicks (1st).

The Return Game

Northwestern transfer Brandon Joseph a starting safety for the Irish and a former All-American with the Wildcats edged out wide receiver Matt Salerno for the punt returner job though Mason said he’s confident enough to use either in a game. Joseph figures to be more dynamic in actually returning punts but he’s shown to be every bit as adept when it comes to ball security as Salerno the latter of whom has a rep for fair-catching punts. In fact Joseph routinely practices catching punts in practice per Mason with a ball already in his hands. “We’ve had competitions to see how many balls you can catch at one time and then try to work on ball security” Mason said. “Some NFL guys were doing it and Brandon wants to beat the NFL guys and compete with it so he’s just having fun with it. “He’s good. He can catch six at one time.” Junior Chris Tyree will return kickoffs again after averaging 26.7 yards on 13 returns with a TD in 2021. Braden Lenzy Lorenzo Styles and Gi’Bran Payne will rotate as the off returner. “We don’t have as much depth at certain offensive skill positions as we all know so … that’s really just gonna depend on where we’re at in the game.”

Coverage Teams

Freeman gave Mason the run of the roster in choosing coverage personnel but both want to be smart about how much Mason uses starters — particularly at positions of tenuous depth. “As a special teams coach who wouldn’t want to play all the best players?” Mason said. “But we’ve gotta be smart on how we use certain guys. There’s gonna be certain guys that have a huge role on offense or defense that maybe are on one or two different special teams. “If it’s a position that we don’t have great depth at they might be on one specials team (or) they might be on no special teams based on the depth of that position. “There are positions — line linebackers and safeties — (where) we have a really experienced older group and a lot of depth. Some of those guys are gonna be on two to three special teams because we’re rotating them on defense. So that’s really dependent on the position and the situation.” Picking coverage players is very different Mason said for punts versus kickoffs. “On kickoffs we’re gonna be almost all defensive players. There’s gonna be a mixture of older and younger guys. We’ll be able to rotate and mix some of those guys in there. “On punt coverage we’re looking for the most dependable guys on the football team. It’s the most important play in football where you impact the most field position (both) positively and negatively. “Usually gunner-wise you’re looking for your best wide receivers because they’re guys that are beating press coverage. We’ll use some DBs there as well. That could just depend on where we’re at in the game and whose legs are fresh as well.” Two freshmen who have stood out and earned special teams roles are linebacker Junior Tuihalamaka and cornerback Jaden Mickey. “We have a really number of talented freshman (but) those two are more mature beyond their years than most other guys” Mason said. “They’ve handled taking on a lot of information processing that information (and) making good game decisions and just kind of being ahead from a maturity and leadership standpoint than most people are when they’re 18 years old.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2Jvc3Rvbi5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9iYXNrZXRiYWxsLWNvdXJ0cy1pbi1tYXR0YXBhbi1kZWRpY2F0ZWQtaW4tbWVtb3J5LW9mLW1lZGluYS1kaXhvbi8yODEzNzgxL9IBdWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2Jvc3Rvbi5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9iYXNrZXRiYWxsLWNvdXJ0cy1pbi1tYXR0YXBhbi1kZWRpY2F0ZWQtaW4tbWVtb3J5LW9mLW1lZGluYS1kaXhvbi8yODEzNzgxLz9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Basketball Courts in Mattapan Dedicated to Memory of Medina Dixon,"Boston city leaders gathered Saturday afternoon at the Walker Playground in Mattapan to dedicate the basketball courts there in honor of late Medina Dixon.

Mayor Michelle Wu and Boston Parks Commissioner Ryan Woods were joined by members of Dixon's family as well as local coaches and players to dedicate what became the first ever basketball courts in the City of Boston park system to be named after a woman.

""This is a tribute to as much Medina Dixon as it is to the family and the legacy that they continue to represent"" Mayor Michelle Wu said. ""We’re very grateful to the Parks Department and so many for making sure that her legacy will always and forever be here as a platform for other young people to build their dreams on top of as well.""

Dixon grew up in Mattapan and by the time she transferred to Cambridge Rindge & Latin from West Roxbury High School she was among the top female high school players in the country. She started off in college at South Carolina in 1981 before heading to Old Dominion. There she was an NCAA champion and brought gold back at the FIBA World Championship and bronze at both the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba and the 1992 summer Olympics in Barcelona.

TechInsight a Canadian tech media outlet revealed that SMIC had advanced its technology to a quasi-7-nanometer (nm) process which might be a stepping stone for a true 7nm process. According to TechInsight SMIC products made from the quasi-7nm process had been shipped for a year. Some media argued that the SMIC’s advancement showed that the U.S. blockade was too little too late and out of date.

SMIC’s most advanced chip process node successfully made in the past was 14nm although it has always made strong attempts to move toward an advanced process node (below 10nm). However due to SMIC’s inclusion on the Entity List by the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security in December 2020 which was designed to limit SMIC’s ability to reach advanced technology nodes of 10 nanometers or below it has been blocked from obtaining the necessary Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUV) machines from ASML of the Netherlands.

The use of an EUV machine is not necessary in theory to make the advanced process nodes. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) the global leader in semiconductor manufacturing used Deep Ultraviolet Lithography (DUV) machines in the early stage of its 7nm volume production. But using DUV machines requires more layers of masks which means more times of exposure and more complexity. This will lead to a lower yield rate and a higher cost for each chip making such a process commercially inviable nowadays.

But the semiconductor industry is of a strategic importance for China. Having the capacity to make advanced chips is more important than the prices of these chips. It appears that SMIC is indeed moving ahead to use this older technology to achieve technological breakthroughs. In October 2020 it was reported that SMIC had successfully developed “quasi-7nm” chips with the FinFET N+1 process using DUV machines.

TSMC’s chairman Dr. Mark Liu said that the 7nm process was a full node stride and a watershed in semiconductor manufacturing. The biggest difference between the 7nm and 14nm processes is that the number of transistors per unit area of the 7nm process increases greatly and its energy consumption is reduced substantially. These makes 7nm chips far more powerful than 14nm one yet also more economical. For example in 2020 the cost of a 7nm chip was $233 which was not only lower than the $331 cost of a 16nm chip but also lower than the $238 cost of a 5nm chip. In addition the performance of NVIDIA’s A100 Tensor Core data-center processor which uses TSMC’s 7nm process increased by 20 times so that the data center which originally required 25 racks can be reduced to a single rack.

In other words 7nm chips not only lower the cost of ownership but also deliver high computing performance which makes AI cloud computing and 5G economically viable both in business and military applications.

China’s Semiconductor Industry Sprints to Improve Self-Sufficiency

There is a big gap between chip consumption and chip manufacturing in China meaning its chip self-sufficiency rate is low. In 2021 the size of China’s semiconductor market was about $186.5 billion of which only $31.2 billion worth of chips were manufactured in China both by foreign and domestic companies – a self-sufficiency rate of 16.7 percent. Furthermore only $12.3 billion worth of chips were manufactured by China-headquartered companies accounting for merely 6.6 percent of domestic consumption.

To reach the goal outlined by the “Made in China 2025” initiative a self-sufficiency rate of 75 percent needs to be achieved by 2030. Under such pressure it is not difficult to understand why China has subsidized semiconductor companies to build factories through various policy incentives. While there are notorious “unfinished fabs” cases in the development of the semiconductor industry the failure has not caused China to retreat from its policy to fully support semiconductor factories.

The experience of developing the electronics industry in the past has made Chinese policy planners understand that even though China’s semiconductor industry lags behind foreign manufacturers in terms of its production scale and technology there are two effects that will urge China to support a large number of semiconductor companies through policies. First a large number of Chinese manufacturers can “eat up” the market and compress the space for second- and third-tier wafer foundries. According to one report by the end of 2024 China will be leading the world by building new 31 chip factories surpassing 19 in Taiwan and 12 in the United States. Since most of the 31 new factories in China will be making mature processes nodes there is little impact on the leading manufacturers such as TSMC Intel and Samsung all of which use advanced processes. However China’s “fab sea” tactic may exert huge pressure on other mature process manufacturers.

Given that excess inventory has emerged in some areas of the electronics industry and the market expects that there will be excess production capacity in chip manufacturing after 2023 price competition is inevitable. Foundries using mature processes will not be able to compete with Chinese semiconductor factories that enjoy major policy subsidies. Some second- and third-tier foundries may have to withdraw from the market which will allow Chinese foundries to dominate the mature process market.

Second if one or two Chinese companies can stand out among the large number of policy-supported foundries there is a hope that this “national champion” can compete or even dominate the advanced process market. Lenovo in the PC/laptop sector and Huawei and ZTE in communications were all developed using such a model. And SMIC may be the leading Chinese company that can compete in the international advanced semiconductor arena and break technology strangleholds set by the United States. The 7nm advancement discovered by TechInsight is the best proof.

In the past Chinese chip design companies were sanctioned by the United States and could not use TSMC’s advanced process to launch new products. If SMIC can extend the 7nm process to be used on other Chinese manufacturers’ products it will allow China to accelerate its advancement in AI high-speed computing and 5G etc. The acceleration will enable China to achieve its goal of moving from a “manufacturing giant” to a “world manufacturing power.”

The Effectiveness of Entity List Needs to be Reassessed

We currently know very little about SMIC’s 7nm shipments yield rates and prices; it is not even clear whether there are other applications. However the advancement of the 7nm process is expected to allow China to make breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and high-speed computing. In turn that will also increase China’s economic and military threats to not only Taiwan but all of East Asia.

China has set goals to achieve “complete modernization” based on “informatization” “intelligence” and “mechanization” by the People’s Liberation Army’s 100th anniversary in 2027. Breakthroughs in AI quantum computing and hypersonics all require the assistance of advanced chips. Only blocking China from acquiring EUV machines will not prevent China from advancing in advanced process chips which will eventually help its military buildup. More efforts are needed.

The United States is now trying to exert diplomatic pressure on Japan and the Netherlands to extend the current EUV embargo to include DUV machines. Some may argue that isolating China will only accelerate its march to self-sufficiency. From the past history of China’s industrialization China’s ambition will not stop until the country dominates the entire market. Therefore only limiting China from obtaining EUV machines will not suit the original purpose of keeping China from making advanced technology nodes of 10nm or below.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNDY3LTAyMi0zMjY0Ny050gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Light-responsive self-strained organic semiconductor for large flexible OFET sensing array,"Characterizations of AZO-BTBT-8

As designed the molecular structure DFT-calculated molecular conformation and frontier orbitals of AZO-BTBT-8 are shown in Fig. 1a. AZO-BTBT-8 mainly presents as planar trans conformation in the ambient environment while the UV light triggered the isomerization to cis conformation with benzene rings tilted to each other. This photoisomerization slightly increases the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) benefiting the energy level alignment with electrode Au (−5.1 eV) in the top-contact/bottom-gate device architecture (Fig. 1b).

The orbital values are obtained from DFT calculations (black solid line Supplementary Table 2) CV (Supplementary Fig. 6) and UV − Vis absorptions measurements (red dashed line for solution samples and purple solid line for solid films Supplementary Table 3).

All the experiments are conducted with spinning-coated film samples annealed at 80°C unless otherwise stated. The thermodynamic properties of the bulk material were first investigated. Supplementary Fig. 2a shows the breakdown temperature of 340°C demonstrating strong thermal stability which is a critical requirement for OFET electronics. According to the differential scanning calorimetry plots (DSC Supplementary Fig. 2b) liquid crystals and Maltese crosses were revealed by polarized optical microscope (POM) in the incubation at 80°C (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4). Thus to optimize molecular packing in thin-film devices an annealing temperature of 80 °C (30 min Supplementary Fig. 5) was selected to help with the molecular rearrangement2728. AZO-BTBT-8 thin film was further examined with atomic force microscope (AFM). As shown in Fig. 2a the film of AZO-BTBT-8 shows good continuity and flatness with molecular step edges which is suitable for electronic device fabrication. After exposure to UV light (365 nm 20 mW∙cm-2) for two hours the average step height of the surface monolayer decreased from 3.11 to 2.85 nm (Fig. 2b) which is consistent with the DFT calculated value (27.2 Å to 24.9 Å difference of 2.3 Å Supplementary Fig. 16) and indicates the complete photoisomerization on the film surface. The time-dependent UV-Vis experiment is then conducted to investigate the photoisomerization kinetics showing the reversible photoisomerization of AZO-BTBT-8 in both solid film and solution (Supplementary Figs. 9a and 10). However compared to the solution (Supplementary Fig. 9b) the thin films sample (800 nm Fig. 2d) shows a much weaker response which can be attributed to the steric hindrance in the condensed phase29. Due to the steric hindrance a fraction of the molecules is triggered for photoisomerization inside the film under UV irradiation in contrast to almost 100% on the surface. Therefore the heterogeneous conformational change in the film is predictable with higher conversion ratio towards the top surface (Fig. 2c). As a result the thicker film shows lower overall conversion ratio slower conversion kinetics and longer half-life time (t 1/2 ) as observed experimentally in Fig. 2e and Supplementary Table 4. It is well-known that strain engineering is a general strategy applied in semiconductor materials to enhance device performance3031. Previously the strain-enhanced mobility in organic semiconductors has been achieved by mechanically shearing the growth solution during the crystallization where a substantial mobility improvement is achieved8. In our thin-film device since the top surface contributes to the majority of the photoisomerization while the bottom surface contributes the majority to the electrical conductivity the top surface isomerization can induce uniform lattice strain to the bulk semiconductors (Fig. 2c). Here the molecule configuration deep inside the film is analyzed with grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) conventional X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the electric property is monitored with conductive AFM. Contrary to the high crystallinity on the film surface from the GIXD the film shows low-order diffraction ring (left of Fig. 2f) which indicates more irregular packing inside the bulk phase of the film. Upon UV irradiation GIXD diffraction shifts into distinct Bragg rods (110) and (020) indicating improved packing in xy plane (upper right of Fig. 2f). Interestingly after visible light irradiation this pseudo crystalline phase can be switched back to lower-order phase with weak diffraction and a d-space expansion is observed where (020) peak moves to higher fields with d-value increasing from 2.704 to 2.729 Å (lower right of Fig. 2f). It is well known that the strain can induce ordering and crystalline in amorphous materials and the rich dynamics of glass composed of photoisomerization molecules have been discussed recently32. Since this reversible crystallinity change can not be explained by direct photoisomerization of molecules we attribute this effect to the strain-induced crystallization while the details mechanism requires further investigation. From the thin film XRD the d-space shrinking is also observed where the diffraction peaks at 21.05° shift to higher fields under UV irradiation (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Fig. 13) with d-value of the main peak decreasing correspondingly from 4.093 to 4.073 Å. The photoisomerization-induced strain can change the carrier mobility and material conductivity similarly to previous mechanical-induced strain33. As shown in Fig. 2h and Supplementary Fig. 8 the conductive AFM scan shows a significant and instant current increase upon UV irradiation and a gradual current decay (K = 0.01587 min−1 ca. 120 min falling with the baseline) at room temperature in the dark which can be attributed to the thermal isomerization of cis to trans in the film and the strain-induced ordering resulting in high carrier mobility253435.

Theoretical calculations

Moreover it is calculated that cis is an unstable conformation excited from trans (Fig. 3a). However compared with those with single conformation the binding energy between cis and trans is much higher (Fig. 3b) resulting in regular molecular arrangement and alignment which also explains that despite the limited concentration of cis especially inside the film it is still able to optimize the molecular packing and further stress on the deeper molecules. In addition the average distance between the trans-trans conformations (3.129 Å) in the DFT calculation is larger than that between trans-cis conformations (3.104 Å) which indicates light-induced isomerization also synergistically optimizes molecular interaction with dense stacking and ultimately improves device performance (Supplementary Fig. 17). With displacement boundary conditions we simplified the film section and calculated the strain and stress distributions (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 18). It was observed that after UV irradiation both the stress and strain accumulated along the x-axis and eventually released at the film edge. The stress gradually decreases with film depth and ultimately reaches the interface between dielectric and semiconductor affecting the device output through molecular packing optimization. This is in good agreement with the above-proposed mechanism.

Device properties

The photo-switchable OFET devices were then fabricated based on a bottom-gate/top-contact architecture (Fig. 1b) to characterize the electrical properties and mechanical stability. The cross-sectional scanning electron microscope (SEM) and element mapping show the homogeneous layered structure of the architecture which is essential to minimize the macroscopic carrier hindrance (Supplementary Fig. 14). Furthermore after the deposition of gold electrodes a new fraction of the sulfur peak appears to the lower-field in the XPS plots (Supplementary Fig. 15) due to the development of a high-strength S-Au bond27 which can reduce the contact barrier between the semiconductor and the electrode. Then the electrical characteristics were examined to quantify the photoisomerization (Fig. 4 Supplementary Figs. 19 and 20). Compared with the negligible photocurrent under UV irradiation (Supplementary Fig. 21) the carrier mobility of annealed device on PET rises from 0.015 ± 0.007 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. 4a–b) to 0.141 ± 0.009 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. 4c–d) with a fixed on/off ratio of 105 showing an increase of 9.4 times on average due to optimized molecular stacking as described previously. In comparison to the device on silicon (Supplementary Fig. 22 and Supplementary Table 6) the flexible device maintains the expected response with moderate performance loss for the rough and bending substrate (Supplementary Table 1). Interestingly the mobility of as-cast film is also improved after UV irradiation which indicates that the strain effect generated by photo-isomerization packs the molecules more regularly similarly to thermal annealing. Furthermore it is found that the device photoresponse increases with UV intensity at the low intensity range (Supplementary Fig. 23). Intense irradiation on the other hand may result in molecular degradation against the device performance. The relationship between incident angle and light response has also been investigated (Supplementary Fig. 24). Due to the varied optical route the device response is observed to be unaffected by the constant radiant intensity on the top surface and the various intensities on the bottom interface. On the other hand front and back irradiation produce different responses to intense (20 mW cm−2 enough light intensity to penetrate the device) and week (100 μW cm−2 not enough intensity to penetrate the device) UV light respectively. Both of these results suggest that the photoisomerization of the top surface has a greater impact on the OFET device’s photoresponse. To estimate the folding capability a homemade apparatus was designed to realize controllable convex and concave bending (Supplementary Fig. 25). As the PET film is thin the tensile and compressive stress were both small in the bending test and the devices showed negligible performance deterioration during the deformation (Fig. 4e). All the devices showed steady device performance in the deformation test with strain with negligible degradation of the transfer curve (Fig. 4e inset). It is noted that the device also exhibited excellent cyclic performance its mobility and switching ratio stayed constant at 0.015 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 105 after 200 bending cycles respectively (Fig. 4f) and the drain current was reversible under alternant UV and visible light illumination. As shown in Fig. 4g the light-inducing isomerization caused a current change with a stable magnitude of around 10 times (V DS = −25 V V G = −25 V). On the other hand heating also leads to cis-trans isomerization. As shown in Fig. 4h and Supplementary Table 5 the rate constant (k) of cis to trans conformation increased by heating producing apparent activation energy of 65.67 kJ mol−1 while the rate constant at 35 °C (k = 0.07926 min−1) is comparable to that under Vis irradiation. Moreover the device showed better mobility (Supplementary Fig. 26) and slower decay plot (dashed red line in Fig. 4h) at room temperature after UV irradiation at 80 °C proving the important evidence of steric hindrance in solid-state photoisomerization.

Sensing tests by the OFET array

The as-prepared single OFET device exhibits good performance as described above however to implement true high availability how to make large-scale flexible array is inevitable3637. To realize it we design a strategy by depositing patterned electrodes directly on a desired flexible substrate as shown in Fig. 5a. Specifically patterned AZO-BTBT-8 source electrodes hafnium oxide dielectric layer and drain electrodes were deposited sequentially on an Al 2 O 3 covered ITO-PET. Thus the precise device array layout was obtained (Fig. 5b). Figures 5c and d shows the optical image of a 33 × 40 device array the magnified view of the 3 × 3 device array and the SEM image of the individual device respectively. The average mobility increased from 0.016 ± 0.005 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 0.152 ± 0.009 cm2 V−1 s−1 under UV illumination with the on/off ratio of 105 (L = 50 and W = 1080 μm) which is consistent with the individual OFET device and demonstrates the reproducibility of the device performance. The optical pattern is obtained after top UV illumination to the array through a smiling cartoon sun garland mask for 20 minutes (Fig. 5e) where the exposed area switched from OFF state (~0.2 μA) to ON state (~2.8 μA) (Fig. 5f). Since the photoisomerization is reversible the image can be erased with visible light irradiation and repatterned. As shown in Fig. 5g h the previous pattern is erased with 30 min exposure of visible light and can be repatterned under the UV illumination with the diaglyph pattern “Hi! Chem!” and a happy emoji. All evidence suggests that the OFET array devices are reversible programable and scalable with promising potential in other fields like flexible sensors displays wearable devices health care and tissue detection.

In this work a functional molecule AZO-BTBT-8 was designed and synthesized by integrating photochromic azobenzene high-performance semiconductor backbone BTBT and flexible alkyl chains. The light-induced self-strain engineering is observed in this material and leads to reversible mobility switching in solid-state devices. Based on this mechanism a large-scale flexible OFET device was fabricated on a flexible substrate using AZO-BTBT-8 molecules as photoisomerization OSCs showing good stability and reproducibility.

Businesses and governments spend billions upon billions each year to protect their assets from cyberattacks. And Statista expects that global market to increase from $183 billion to $539 billion by the end of the decade.

The industry isn't as fragmented as one might think. The top five cybersecurity exchange-traded funds (ETFs) according to The Motley Fool all have CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW) as Top 10 holdings and three of the ETFs have both in their top five. And for a good reason as we'll discuss below.

We all know about ransomware and breaches which companies defend against daily but cyberattacks have also become a strategy for some nations. Cyberattacks increased in Ukraine as the Russian invasion began and Taiwan was hit with cyberattacks during U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's recent visit.

Much of our crucial infrastructure defense in the U.S. falls on the private sector. Increasing tensions make cybersecurity companies essential and therefore strong long-term investments.

CrowdStrike is leveraging growth

CrowdStrike is a force in the cybersecurity industry. Its cloud-based solutions powered by artificial intelligence attract major clients including over half of the Fortune 500 and 15 of the top 20 banks in the U.S. Its total customer base is exploding and the growth over the prior four fiscal years is shown below.

CrowdStrike added another 1620 customers in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and now has 17945.

What do we mean by leveraging this growth? CrowdStrike rapidly increases the amount its customers spend with it each period with a dollar-based net retention rate consistently over 120%. For example a customer might sign a contract for CrowdStrike services for one year at $50000. Then the following year it adds more modules and spends $60000.

CrowdStrike's annual recurring revenue has increased from $71 million in the first quarter of 208 to over $1.9 billion as of the 2023 first quarter. The company is not yet generating profits on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) but posted $442 million in free cash flow last fiscal year.

CrowdStrike should be near the top of the list for growth-oriented investors.

Palo Alto Networks is an industry leader

Palo Alto Networks is an established leader with the most sales of any independent security company. It has tremendous reach offering network cloud zero-trust and endpoint security and other products and services.

Management is expected to release fourth-quarter and fiscal-year 2022 earnings after market close on Monday Aug. 22. Investors should be optimistic since Palo Alto raised its full-year guidance last quarter. It now expects revenue to come in at $5.5 billion for the fiscal year representing a 29% increase year over year.

The earnings report could boost the stock given that the valuation lags behind established competitors like Fortinet as shown below.

Palo Alto posts impressive non-GAAP earnings per share and free cash flow but is not GAAP profitable due to stock-based compensation (SBC). Management has made it a goal to reduce its SBC as a percentage of revenue. This should be a positive for shareholders.

Both companies are taking advantage of ballooning spending on cyberdefense. The market can be volatile in the short term but long-term investors should do well owning a piece of these innovative companies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15c21hcnRwcmljZS5jb20vZ2Vhci93ZWItc3Rvcmllcy9pbmRpYW4tb3JpZ2luLWNlb3MtbGVhZGluZy1jb21wYW5pZXMv0gFTaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubXlzbWFydHByaWNlLmNvbS9nZWFyL3dlYi1zdG9yaWVzL2luZGlhbi1vcmlnaW4tY2Vvcy1sZWFkaW5nLWNvbXBhbmllcy8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,From Google to Twitter: Indian Origin CEO's Leading Companies,Arvind Krishna has been at IBM for nearly two decades and is a graduate of the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur.

Should You?,"Buffett's position makes him one of the company's largest shareholders.

Warren Buffett's firm Berkshire Hathaway originally bought 68.9 million shares of Paramount Global (PARA 2.03%) in the first quarter of 2022. During the second quarter the Oracle of Omaha added another 9.5 million shares to bring his total ownership to 78.4 million by the end of the year's first half.

Buffett now owns nearly 13% of the company's Class B shares making him the largest such shareholder. Here's why you should own shares too.

Content is king

In the immortal words of Paramount's founder Sumner Redstone ""content is king."" That may be what Buffett saw when he initially built a position in the company's stock. Paramount's branded networks include Nickelodeon Comedy Central and BET. Perhaps more captivating are Paramount's news and sports franchises which air on cable broadcast and streaming platforms.

One of America's favorite sports is football and Paramount is an NFL staple. The company holds rights to AFC and NFC regular season games playoff games and the Super Bowl on a rotating basis with other networks. Its rights also include college football games from the Southeastern Conference and conference championship games from other power conferences.

The list goes on. Paramount also hosts games from regular season college basketball games and the NCAA's wildly popular annual March Madness tournament. Every year March Madness is followed by another annual sports tradition the Masters PGA golf tournament. Paramount has the rights to that too.

Though football is one of the most popular sports in the U.S. soccer is the international favorite. Paramount's soccer rights feature more than 2000 matches each year from UEFA Champions League Italy's Serie A and the National Women's Soccer League shown on its streaming platform Paramount+.

Paramount's vast content library and sports rights have grown streaming subscribers domestically but its international partnerships could be the next leg of growth in subs. For instance the company has partnered with European cable giant Sky to bundle Paramount+ with its cable offering. During the last quarter Paramount+ launched in the U.K. Ireland and South Korea. In September the streaming platform will launch in Italy and later this year in Germany Austria France and Switzerland. The best part of Paramount's partnership strategy is that each new subscriber comes with zero acquisition cost.

Capitalizing on its international sports momentum Paramount recently won the streaming rights to air Indian Premier League Cricket (IPL) for the next five years. Like soccer in many countries Cricket is easily the favorite sport in India. However there is one big difference -- India is the world's second-most populous country. Previously Disney's Hotstar streaming platform which has 50 million paid subscribers hosted IPL matches. Now Paramount will seek to transition those viewers to Paramount+.

Last quarter management told investors it saw strong acquisitions and engagement on Paramount+ from its new stable of TV shows which includes 1883 and Star Trek: Strange New Worlds. On top of that the company's eagerly anticipated theatrical release of Top Gun: Maverick was a smash at the global box office raking in $1.3 billion and supplanting Paramount's own Titanic at No. 7 in all-time domestic box office receipts.

Buffett bought it should you?

Buffett likes to buy downtrodden stocks of companies that he believes can thrive in the long run meaning he likes to buy the dip just as much as anyone else. Paramount stock has certainly dipped collapsing 32% over the last year.

Part of the reason for the stock's underperformance is due to many investors focusing squarely on subscriber growth. In its second quarter Paramount added 5.2 million subscribers to its platforms and removed 3.9 million from Russia for a net gain of 1.7 million. Even before accounting for the Russian removals that number is down from the 6.3 million subs it added in the first quarter.

Other streamers are seeing growth moderate as well. Disney+ subscriber growth slowed in the second quarter and the company lowered its long-term subscriber goal. Netflix actually lost subscribers last quarter and said losses would likely continue this quarter.

Investor concerns also extend to losses generated by the streamers. Paramount's direct-to-consumer (DTC) segment has lost money in the last two quarters since management began reporting it as an independent segment. Management expects peak losses from its DTC segment to occur next year. Disney expects its streaming platforms to be profitable in 2024.

Building out the infrastructure to host streaming platforms requires an enormous amount of capital but Paramount is nearing the finish line. After that ongoing expenditures should diminish considerably. Paramount expects to increase revenue in its DTC segment from $2.3 billion in the first half of 2022 to $9 billion by 2024 a year after peak losses.

If you're truly a long-term investor like Buffett you'll want to buy and hold the beaten-down stock of this high-quality company and wait a few years. That's a strategy right out of the Buffett playbook.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzbWFnYXppbmUuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvcGljdHVyZXMvaWNhcmx5LXNlYXNvbi0zLW9uLXBhcmFtb3VudC1ldmVyeXRoaW5nLXRvLWtub3cv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'iCarly' Season 3 on Paramount+: Everything to Know,"If you are looking for a dose of Nickelodeon nostalgia the iCarly reboot on Paramount+ is the show for you.

Picking up where the original show left off the iCarly reboot has all of the fun humor and zany characters as the Nickelodeon version (minus Jennette McCurdy‘s Sam) but the protagonists are all grown-up this time around.

More than a decade has passed since this beloved kids’ TV show went off the air — and 10 years have passed in Carly’s world too. The silly situations these characters face have been updated for an adult audience reflecting changes to the social media landscape in the decade since we last saw Carly and her pals.

In the original iteration of iCarly Carly Shay (Miranda Cosgrove) hosted a web show that streamed on the Internet (also titled “iCarly”). Now Carly is a social media influencer who’s navigating the changing landscape of her career and the reality of what it takes to be an adult.

“To be perfectly honest when I was first asked about maybe coming back all the first talks about it started a couple years ago. And I was like ‘No we’re never gonna do that’” the School of Rock actress told Variety in June 2022. “And I called [my original costars] Jerry [Trainor] and Nathan [Kress] and they were like ‘No we shouldn’t do that.’ And then we just kept talking about it.”

Cosgrove added: “And we came up with the idea that because we’re adults now and all the people that originally watched the show they were kids that grew up and are adults now like us we were like ‘Why don’t we make the show for them?’ They’re the people that loved the show originally and they’re really who this is for. So that really gave us a lot of direction after we realized that we were all on board and wanted to do that. And it started to get really fun after that.”

The first season of the new iCarly debuted on Paramount+ in June 2021 with a 13-episode order. A second season was later greenlit returning in 2022 with 10 new episodes.

“I was proud when I started producing the iCarly reboot and people started listening to my ideas” Cosgrove exclusively gushed to Us Weekly in March 2022 referring to her role as a producer on the revival. “I love being able to help write the comedy on the iCarly reboot.”

Paramount+ eventually announced the sitcom’s third season in July 2022 alongside a vague 2023 release date.

It's been less than two years since Walmart (WMT 0.58%) launched Walmart+ and it's already seeing its subscriber growth stagnate. The big-box retailer attracted about 11 million customers to its shipping subscription according to researchers at Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP). Not only does that pale in comparison to the 172 million U.S. shoppers using Amazon (AMZN 0.80%) Prime it's actually lost subscribers since the start of the year.

While stagnating subscriber growth is a challenge for Amazon as well Walmart's relatively new subscriber offering and smaller subscriber base suggest there's room to grow. But Walmart may be looking in all the wrong places.

Looking for new partners

Walmart's strategy to grow its membership is to partner with various companies to draw in new subscribers or provide additional perks to members.

Most recently it partnered with Paramount Global (PARA 2.03%) to offer Walmart+ members free access to the ad-supported tier of Paramount+. Paramount counted 43 million global Paramount+ subscribers as of the end of June.

The video streaming service addition echoes Amazon's move to include Prime Video in its membership program. That said Walmart won't be able to exercise much control over the future of the streaming business. Amazon meanwhile is investing billions to make it one of the best streaming options available for consumers differentiating itself with things like Thursday Night Football.

Additionally Walmart partnered with American Express to give Platinum cardholders free memberships. The move is aimed at attracting more affluent households to Walmart a demographic not typically associated with the ""everyday low price"" retailer.

It also partnered with ExxonMobil and Murphy USA to offer discounts on fuel at their gas stations. The move expands the reach beyond Walmart's own fuel stations which are somewhat limited geographically.

Prime competition

Walmart is faced with a challenging environment right now. Inflation is squeezing the budgets of many of its shoppers leaving them with little room to pay for more discretionary items outside of groceries. Groceries are notably a low-margin business.

On top of that since many consumers are only buying groceries they're finding lower-priced grocery stores like Aldi a better alternative than making the trip to Walmart. Traffic to Walmart has dropped over the last two months while discount retailers have seen foot traffic climb according to a report from Reuters. Walmart reported the total number of transactions in U.S. stores (including online) grew just 1% in the second quarter.

Meanwhile Amazon said it had its biggest Prime Day ever and any negative impacts from its price hike in March were more muted than management anticipated. Indeed Amazon appears to be retaining the less price-sensitive more-affluent customers Walmart needs for Walmart+ while maintaining broad appeal.

Walmart's challenge is that it's hard to differentiate its service from those that already exist. It's living in the shadow of Amazon Prime. Partnering with other service providers isn't going to massively increase the value Walmart offers through Walmart+.

Walmart needs to find a way to offer outsized value that stems from its unique offerings like its pharmacy money services and other in-store services. Focusing on the convenience of shopping at Walmart may serve the retailer better than trying to partner with other companies. As it tacks on other services despite seeing limited growth it could be burning hundreds of millions of dollars if not billions on payments to partners that may be better off reinvested in itself to grow the program internally."

The band played at the Paycom Center in Oklahoma City to begin a 25-date tour that takes them through until early October.

At the show they performed the track ‘Bury Me In Black’ for the first time in 19 years as the second song in the set before going on to play ‘This Is the Best Day Ever‘ for the first time since 2005.

Elsewhere they dedicated ‘The Ghost Of You’ to Doug McKean the producer who died aged 54 last month with his most recent work on the band’s comeback single ‘The Foundations Of Decay’. Upon his death MCR led tributes writing: “My Chemical Romance lost Doug McKean a dear friend a collaborator a partner a brother a problem-solver a genius an integral part of our music. Doug was someone who made us laugh made us better understood and always came to the rescue. He is deeply missed. He always will be.⁣”

Elsewhere at the Oklahoma City show the band played hits ‘Teenagers’ ‘I’m Not Okay (I Promise)’ and many more across a 22-song set.

My Chemical Romance kicked off their run of live dates in mid-May at the Eden Project in Cornwall marking their first UK show in 11 years.

In a five-star review NME said: “They’re now safely one of the biggest rock groups to emerge in the last 20 years but if the band are worried about their new found status they don’t show it. Tonight’s show is fearless loose and raw. It genuinely feels like anything could happen as My Chemical Romance channel punk rebellion and playful ambition. ‘This has been special and amazing’ says Way taking the words right out of our mouths.”

The fizzing static distortions in the intro to “The Foundations of Decay” the surprise single released this May in support of the reunion tour practically serve as white noise behind the jubilant roars of the crowd as the band takes the stage inside Oklahoma City’s Paycom Arena. (Grab tickets to the rest of MCR’s tour dates here.)

Clocking in at an epic six minutes “The Foundations of Decay” features a bite-sized version of the same world-building story-craft often associated with the My Chemical Romance albums. Way’s soft-spoken early verse conjures the image of an old and battered general atop a hill reflecting both on wounds both physical and emotional. The parallels between the protagonist and Way himself are clear and longtime MCR fans know exactly how the singer got these scars.

Way’s words carry a personal connotation but it is a sentiment that likely resonates with many gathered tonight. In the past few decades the band’s core age demographic has lived through 9/11 recession multiple wars a global pandemic and the ever-growing sense that society’s status quo could disintegrate at any moment — goldilocks conditions for the nihilist origin stories of a generation. So as the band transitions into the song’s howling crescendo and a giant red curtain falls behind them to reveal a dystopian backdrop of crumbling city towers looming ragged over the fuming debris at ground zero the stage is finally set. Here we are at the cusp of oblivion. What happens now?

If the world is in its decay era Way and MCR appear less interested in saving it and are instead content to go out laughing crying raging. MCR transition form their newest song into “Bury Me in Black” and the adrenaline-kicker “Give ‘Em Hell Kid” aided by impressively precise percussion from new drummer Jarrod Alexander who’s performing with the phrase “BIG DEATH ENERGY” scrawled in red across the front of the kick drum.

One of the most endearing aspects of MCR is their catalog rich with catchy choruses and melodies just begging for a singalong and the band tosses an eager crowd its first bone with “Teenagers.” Lead guitarist and backing vocalist Ray Toro can’t help but smile as he eggs the fans on. Though the European leg of the reunion tour preceded the American dates there is nothing like a home crowd; hearing a near-capacity audience recite a song’s every word back to the band is not a new experience for MCR but this is the first time since the pandemic the members have heard it from an American audience. Aside from a few one-off reunion shows it’s also their first full tour since 2012. Nostalgia’s comforting embrace hugs the entire room.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndlbGNvbWV0b2xvdWRjaXR5LmNvbS8yMDIyLzgvMjEvMjMzMTYwMzIvb2tjLXRodW5kZXItd2h5LWEtbmV3LWFyZW5hLWlzLXZpdGFsLWZvci10aGUtdGh1bmRlci1hbmQtZG93bnRvd27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OKC Thunder: Why a new arena is vital for the Thunder and downtown,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.welcometoloudcity.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2022/8/21/23316032/okc-thunder-why-a-new-arena-is-vital-for-the-thunder-and-downtown (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159B889CB50>, 'Connection to www.welcometoloudcity.com timed out.

The 22-song set marked the first time the group had performed either track live in over 15 years. Elsewhere during the show My Chemical Romance played hits like “I’m Not Okay (I Promise)” and “Teenagers.”

My Chemical Romance launched their reunion tour earlier this year at the Eden Project in Cornwall England. Prior to the tour the band released a new single “The Foundations of Decay.” The sprawling six-minute epic that blends to-the-rafters emo rock with clever twists and turns into hardcore and prog that marked My Chemical Romance’s first new music in eight years.

After disbanding in 2013 the group announced their return in fall 2019 and played a single show that December but the first wave of Covid-19 forced them to put their touring plans on hold. The dates were initially rescheduled for 2021 but pushed again because of ongoing Covid concerns. The North American leg runs through October.

My Chemical Romance’s last studio album Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys was released in 2010.

Al Sharpton demanding PayPal end relationship with Suns team owner Robert Sarver,"Rev. Al Sharpton remains relentless when it comes to Phoenix Suns team owner Robert Sarver.

The civil rights leader wrote PayPal president and CEO Dan Schulman in an open letter that appeared in the Sunday edition of The Arizona Republic demanding the billion-dollar digital payment company cease its relationship with Sarver the majority owner of the Phoenix Suns Phoenix Mercury and Spanish soccer club Real Club Deportivo Mallorca.

“As someone who has dedicated my life to fighting injustice and speaking out against hate in all its forms it is my duty and responsibility to call out such hypocrisy and to call on PayPal to uphold the values for which it proclaims to stand” Sharpton wrote.

The Sarver investigation began in November of last year after an ESPN report detailed allegations of racism and misogyny against Sarver claiming he created a ""toxic"" work environment within the Suns' organization.

MORE: Robert Sarver disputes ESPN report calling it 'innacurate misleading'

“Mr. Sarver’s leadership has been riddled with credible allegations of racism misogyny and harboring a toxic work environment” Sharpton wrote.

The letter to PayPal ran as a full-page ad paid for by the American Sports Accountability Project.

Sharpton pointed out how PayPal committed $535 million to support Black-owned businesses and to fight economic inequality in wake of the death of George Floyd on May 25 2020 but the company remains in business with Sarver.

“PayPal has continued to do business with Robert Sarver and is now expanding its business relationship with Mr. Sarver internationally” Sharpton wrote. “In light of these commitments PayPal cannot simply ignore Mr. Sarver’s transgressions.”

Floyd died under the knee of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin a White male on May 25 2020. The death sparked protests in Minneapolis and around the world over racial injustice and policing.

“It is time for PayPal to put its money where its mouth is” Sharpton wrote. “Issuing a press release and writing a big check two years ago is not equivalent to doing the hard work that is required to achieve real change.”

This is the latest action taken by Sharpton as he’s been calling for months for the NBA to remove Sarver as Suns team owner and to speed up its investigation.

ASAP launched its website in March with a #SackSarver hashtag that posted a letter written to NBA Commissioner Adam Silver calling for the league to oust Sarver.

Several members of Sharpton’s American Action Network signed the letter that was copied to the Board of Governors which is comprised of team owners.

ASAP is “committed to bringing accountability to perpetrators of hate speech abuse and harassment within the leadership of the American sports industry.""

Last month Silver said in a news conference the Sarver investigation was near completion after the league had a Board of Governors meeting in Las Vegas during NBA Summer League.

Sarver attended the meeting in Vegas.

“I’m not prepared to talk about what the conclusion might be only to say that we are at the sort of last stage of the investigation” Silver said.

Silver was asked why the investigation has nearly taken a year.

“I can only say that we are talking about almost an 18-year period that the ESPN article covered in terms of his ownership” Silver said. “Hundreds of current and former employees that were involved over that period. And also ensuring that everyone’s confidentiality if they asked for it is met and ensuring due process is provided to Mr. Sarver as well.”

Sarver openly welcomed an investigation that Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz a law firm out of New York has been conducting.

“So these things I understand how outsiders can be frustrated and say why do these things take so long” Silver continued. “But having been involved with many of them these kinds of big investigations over my time at the league the most important thing is to get it right and to take the appropriate amount of time to do so.”

The Suns and PayPal agreed to a multi-year partnership going into the 2018-19 season.

PayPal became the first jersey patch partner for the Suns. The Mercury team jerseys also include a PayPal logo.

The NBA approved jersey sponsorships as part of a three-year pilot program. The partnership included that PayPaul became the ""official payment partner"" for the Suns Mercury and RCD Mallorca.

The Suns (PayPal SixthMan) and Mercury (PayPal X-Factor) brand their season ticket sales with PayPal.

“I reiterate my call for PayPal to end its relationship with Robert Sarver and help hold him accountable for his egregious behavior” Sharpton wrote in concluding the letter.

They are currently flying high at the the top of the MLS Western Conference – and depending on results in the latest round of matches this weekend would confirm a playoff place with eight games of the regular season still to play.

Their Welsh star Gareth Bale had missed the team’s last two fixtures but was named on the bench for the game against San Jose.

Ahead of kick off the players were visited by Anchorman star Ferrell in their changing room.

Last week it was revealed that the comic had sent the Wales captain a personal message to help persuade him to sign for the club – and the pair were pictured sharing a joke at San Jose’s Paypal Park Stadium.

Ferrell who is a huge fan of football  was pictured back in May alongside David Beckham Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney at Wembley for the FA Trophy final between Wrexham and Bromley.

This time he shunned any VIP seating to support his side alongside the large and vociferous LAFC fans in the away section at PayPal Park.

Sadly it was a night of both lows and highs for both the Hollywood star and the club’s Welsh icon.

While Bale looked sharp in a 15 minute cameo from the bench he unfortunately couldn’t help his new club avoid defeat against the San Jose Earthquakes losing 2-1.

Despite the final scoreline however there was some good news. Because results elsewhere had gone their way the club had secured a playoff place.

That playoff place was clinched after 25 games equalling the club’s 2019 squad which achieved the same feat.

25 Matches. Playoffs clinched. This ties us with our Historic 2019 squad for the fewest matches needed to clinch an @MLS Playoff spot. x – #LAFC pic.twitter.com/RLHRQtppFw — LAFC (@LAFC) August 21 2022

Over the weekend fans of MTN DEW Pitch Black noticed a new listing on the official PepsiCo beverage facts website. According to that listing MTN DEW Pitch Black is being revived as an exclusive flavor to Speedway stores.

In addition to regular MTN DEW Pitch Black the listing also teases a Zero Sugar alternative available through the chain's fountain machines.

Should the MTN DEW brand in fact bring back Pitch Black it'd be the first time since 2005 the drink has been widely available in the United States. Despite a continue presence in Singapore and Malaysia Pitch Black was first introduced in 2004 before the flavor profile was altered in 2006. It was then available in very few markets stateside between 2011 and 2019 before being discontinued across the board in 2020.

It should be noted that previous flavors have also appeared on the website only to fizzle out at some point throughout the development process so there's no guarantee the flavor will be revived.

If Speedway managed to land the Pitch Black exclusive it wouldn't be the first DEW flavor it landed. MTN DEW Spark was the convenience store chains' first exclusive a few years back and was so popular the brand added the flavor to its permanent lineup nationwide.

""Each time we released MTN DEW SPARK DEW Nation's enthusiasm was off the charts. Some people traveled significant distances just to get a taste"" DEW marketing VIP Pat O'Toole offered in a press release at the time. ""Now fans everywhere can get a taste of MTN DEW SPARK. We are pleased to bring it to shelves nationwide and also introduce a brand new zero sugar beverage with the same bold flavor.""

The above listing only portrays a fountain alternative for both drinks. If Pitch Black were to follow in-line with Spark however the drinks would also be available in 20-ounce bottles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZXdzY291cmllci5jb20vbmV3cy9jbzItc2hvcnRhZ2UtYmVoaW5kLXN1bmRyb3AtZGlzYXBwZWFyYW5jZS9hcnRpY2xlXzZkNmI5ODk4LTFmZmItMTFlZC1iZDc2LTgzNmMzYzMyOTk5NC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CO2 shortage behind SunDrop disappearance | News | enewscourier.com,"Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

PFE,Pfizer,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd2VzdGZhaXJvbmxpbmUuY29tL3VuY2F0ZWdvcml6ZWQvbWVldGluZ3MtdW5kZXJ3YXktb24tcGZpemVyLTQ3MG0tcm9ja2xhbmQtZXhwYW5zaW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meetings underway on Pfizer $470M Rockland expansion,"The Business Journals have learned that informal meetings have taken place between municipal officials and representatives of the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer on the company”™s planned $470 million expansion of its Pearl River campus in the town of Orangetown in Rockland County. Pfizer has been in Rockland since acquiring Wyeth Pharmaceuticals in 2009 along with the buildings and acreage owned by Wyeth. In 2015 Pfizer sold 207 acres and 25 buildings at 401 N. Middletown Road in Pearl River that it wasn”™t going to continue using to Industrial Realty Group LLC (IRG) which now operates the property as Hudson Valley iCampus. Pfizer continues to own 33 acres and occupies about 850000 square feet of building space on its Pearl River campus.

Jerica Pitts Pfizer”™s senior director of global media relations for Pfizer told the Business Journals “Pfizer has new plans for a $470 million transformational investment for its Vaccine Research and Development campus in Pearl River. Over the next three years subject to approvals from officials and other entities as required Pfizer plans to expand and modernize our campus with a new 260000-square-foot lab building for 370 colleagues and amenities such as a modern cafÃ© fitness center parking garage and functional outdoor plaza. The rejuvenated campus will feature connected buildings and a prominent main entrance.”

“It”™s heartening to see the renaissance this company has undergone during my administration” Rockland County Executive Ed Day told the Business Journals. “I”™m happy to see these champions against a global health crisis planning to invest and create even deeper roots within our beautiful county with a $470 million expansion and 100 new hires. I commend Pfizer on its contribution to science and saving lives along with its commitment to calling Rockland home.”

On July 24 Day had gone to Pfizer for a ceremony awarding keys to the county to two of the company”™s employees in view of Pfizer”™s development of a Covid-19 vaccine. Kathrin U. Jansen senior vice president and head of vaccine research and development along with her colleague Steve Bjornson who is vice president and COO of vaccine research and development each received a Key to the County Award for their commitment to science and saving lives.

The expansion is expected to result in Pfizer hiring additional employees. It already employs approximately 1000 at the Pearl River site. It”™s believed Pfizer wants to break ground by 2024 and complete the expansion in 2026.

“I think all-around it”™s a win-win” Orangetown Town Supervisor Teresa Kenny told the Business Journals. “They are making a commitment to staying here. There are over 1000 employees onsite. They always had a lot of employees there but at one point they were down and there was a lot of concern that they were going to sell and leave so it”™s a commitment to being here long term.”

Kenny said that although as of Aug. 5 site plans had not yet been submitted to begin the review process by the Orangetown Planning Board Zoning Board and Building Department the expansion concept was described to her and “it will be a complement to the town.”

Kenny expressed a hope that Pfizer”™s expansion and commitment to Orangetown would attract other bioscience businesses to the area.

Kenny said that she and the town attorney and head of the building department have met informally with Pfizer. Additional informal meetings were expected to take place in the coming weeks.

“They are very anxious apparently to move fast on this” Kenny said. “A lot of how fast they move is in their control. The process itself can take a while but if you listen to the Pfizer representatives they want it done really fast. We”™ll do our best to work with them.”

Kenny said that she lives about a mile from Pfizer in Pearl River and the company has been a good neighbor in the community.

“When I came into office they reached out to me immediately and I went on a tour of their facility pre-Covid. They really wanted to be part of the community” Kenny said. “They”™re a good corporate neighbor and I”™m glad they”™re going to be here for a long time.”

Pfizer says that its Rockland facility is one of its nine major research and development sites.

IRG has been attracting new tenants to its campus and did not yet know whether Pfizer would be leasing space for the expansion or confining any new buildings to the property it already owns. Among the tenants at iCampus are Sanofi US Services Inc. Iris Biogen Corp. Party City and Urban Electric Power Inc.

Jamie Schwarz president of Hudson Valley iCampus told the Business Journals that Momentive Performance Materials has signed a lease for about 67000 square feet of space and is getting it ready for January occupancy.

“We have a bunch of deals in the pipeline so from a leasing perceptive we”™re pretty happy” Schwartz said. “The existing infrastructure in some of the buildings already has the elements that a life-sciences or biomed company needs. There are all kinds of technical requirements although they might need to be updated. That infrastructure would cost somebody a lot of money to build from scratch so we”™re getting a lot of interest from companies in those fields.”

Schwartz said that Pfizer making a commitment to stay in Pearl River and enhance its presence is a huge vote of confidence and sends a signal to others.

“They already had a vaccine operation here but I think they also are happy with how things are going on the campus” Schwartz said. “From a leasing perspective I don”™t think they”™d make that commitment unless they were happy. They do also rent space from us.”

He said that the whole Hudson Valley region benefits from Pfizer”™s planned expansion in Rockland as well as benefitting from the new facilities being constructed in Westchester County by Tarrytown-based Regeneron which broke ground a few weeks ago for a $1.8 billion expansion.

“It”™s nothing but good news” Schwartz said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vZW4ubWVyY29wcmVzcy5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8yMC9wZml6ZXItZmlsZXMtZm9yLWVtZXJnZW5jeS1jbGVhcmFuY2Utb2YtYml2YWxlbnQtYy0xOS12YXgtaW4tYnJhemls0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pfizer files for emergency clearance of bivalent C-19 vax in Brazil,"Pfizer files for emergency clearance of bivalent C-19 vax in Brazil

Pfizer's ComiRNAty vaccine has been applied in Brazil since February 2021 but the new one would also target the Omicron variant

Brazil's National Health Surveillance Agency (Anvisa) has received a request for the emergency use of Pfizer's newest vaccine against COVID-19 which would be active against both the original and the Ômicron strain subvariant BA.1.

Pfizer's ComiRNAty vaccine has been applied in Brazil since February 2021.



Once the request for emergency use authorization is received Anvisa has 30 days to complete the evaluation. This period is interrupted whenever it is necessary to ask the company for complementary information or clarification on the quality efficacy and safety data presented.

The UK was the first country to approve a vaccine designed to combat Omicron. The bivalent vaccine manufactured by US laboratory Moderna was confirmed for approval this week.

The decision by the British regulatory body equivalent to Anvisa was based on clinical trials that showed a strong immune response against Omicron triggered by the immunizer.

Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine with a new formula will be used in the UK primarily as a booster for people aged 50 and over starting in the fall.

The Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (the British equivalent to Anvisa) said the updated Moderna drug protects users against the initial version of SARS-CoV-2 as well as from the more contagious Omicron lineage. It also pointed out the new chemical met British standards of safety quality and effectiveness. The agency said it based its decision on trials that showed a “good immune response” against Omicron sub-variants BA.4 and BA.5. (Source: Agencia Brasil)

Biden first tested positive on Tuesday and her office said at the time that she was suffering only mild symptoms. She contracted the virus during a South Carolina vacation with her family including President Joe Biden.

""After isolating for five days and receiving negative results from two consecutive COVID-19 tests the First Lady will depart South Carolina later today for Delaware"" Biden's communications director Elizabeth Alexander said in a statement.

The First Lady kept up working during her isolation holding zoom calls in preparation for a semester of teaching at Northern Virginia Community College.

DEFENSE SECRETARY LLOYD AUSTIN TESTS POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS FOR A SECOND TIME

Biden treated the virus with Paxlovid and experienced ""cold-like"" symptoms according to the White House.

Her infection came weeks after President Biden contracted the virus twice in late July. White House Physician Kevin O'Connor said the president suffered moderate symptoms. He had a rebound case days after testing negative for the virus however but reportedly experienced no symptoms in that instance. Biden nevertheless self-isolated until August 7.

The Biden family spent last week at a private residence on Kiawah Island a wealthy and secluded vacation spot.

The president's son Hunter Biden accompanied the first couple on Air Force One for the flight from Washington last week. Biden's daughter-in-law Melissa Cohen and grandson Beau also attended.

Earlier this week British regulators became the first in the world to authorize Moderna’s bivalent vaccine which protects against both the original strain of the novel coronavirus and the Omicron BA.1 subvariant.

Health Canada is currently reviewing bivalent booster candidates from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech which leaves some Canadians debating whether to wait for the revamped shots or go for a booster now.

With viral circulation projected to pick up as the season changes some provinces are encouraging people to get a booster of the approved version of the vaccine. For many people that would mean a fourth or fifth dose of the original formula.

Experts say the extent to which the bivalent vaccines provide additional protection from catching COVID-19 is still being studied and the cost-benefit analysis of waiting for one depends on the person.

Here’s a look at what we know about the bivalent vaccines and how they could factor into a fall wave.

WHEN WILL BIVALENT VACCINES BE AVAILABLE?

Health Canada received Moderna’s bivalent vaccine application on June 30 while its British counterpart got the paperwork to start its review earlier that month spokesman Mark Johnson said in an email. Pfizer filed a submission for its updated shot on July 25.

While the agency didn’t provide a timeline on when these reviews are set to wrap up Health Canada has already asked vaccine manufacturers to further tweak their bivalent vaccines to target the fast-spreading Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants “as soon as possible” Johnson said.

Canada’s chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam says Canada has secured a “sufficient” supply of bivalent vaccines if regulators greenlight a rollout.

Infectious disease specialist Dr. Zain Chagla said he expects to see more countries authorize bivalent vaccines in the coming weeks and months which should give Canada time to integrate the updated shots into its fall immunization campaign.

HOW DO BIVALENT BOOSTERS COMPARE TO THE ORIGINAL VACCINES?

Currently available COVID-19 vaccines are monovalent – tailored solely to the original novel coronavirus. In addition to defending against this earlier strain the proposed bivalent vaccines were designed to recognize specific mutations in Omicron’s spike protein that make it better at evading immune detection.

These updated vaccines may provide “incremental” added protection against catching Omicron but the extent remains to be seen said Tam.

Chagla an associate professor at Hamilton’s McMaster University said bivalent vaccines may not be the gamechanger that some have hoped for in curbing the spread of the virus.

As the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants gain steam in much of the country the BA.1-tailored bivalent vaccines might not be that much better than a first-generation booster when it comes to deterring COVID-19 infection Chagla said.

Emerging research suggests that the protection provided by currently available boosters wanes within six to eight weeks said Chagla. He expects that bivalent vaccines could extend this period by a few additional weeks _ not months.

“I’m happy to be proven wrong” he said. “But I don’t know if this is going to reset the clock.”

Both the old and new versions of the COVID-19 vaccines are effective at preventing severe COVID-19 outcomes he noted.

SHOULD I WAIT TO GET A BIVALENT VACCINE?

The short answer is: it depends.

Provinces have expanded access to fourth – and in Quebec fifth – doses of the original COVID-19 vaccine with the expectation that COVID-19 cases will spike as temperatures fall.

With the health-care system already stretched to its limits the priority needs to be boosting those at highest risk of landing in hospital such as immunocompromised people and older adults Chagla said.

But as a greater share of the population has gained hybrid immunity it wouldn’t be unreasonable for low-risk people to wait for the latest version of the vaccine Chagla said.

Tam encouraged Canadians to weigh both their personal risks and level of COVID-19 spread in their community. But if it’s been more than six months since your last infection or vaccination you may want to roll up your sleeves for another shot before the cold weather sets in she said.

“If you waited too long the wave could be starting” she said. “Then you don’t derive as much benefit.”

PLAYING THE CATCH-UP GAME

A key challenge in COVID-19 control is that the evolution of the virus has far outpaced the time it takes to develop test manufacture review and roll out a vaccine that can counteract the latest mutation.

“By the time the wave occurs – two to three months – that’s barely enough to scratch the surface of getting a new vaccine” he said. “There is this catch-up game that’s occurring all the time.”

He hopes the inaugural rollout of bivalent vaccines could provide a “proof-of-concept” that will fast-track this process for future iterations of the vaccine similar to how the flu shot is tweaked every fall to target variants that are circulating.

“There’s nothing wrong with this being a flu-season-like model where people just get updated for a certain amount of time” he said.

While we can’t expect perfect protection from getting sick we can have the tools to prevent severe illness among the most vulnerable.

“We’re lucky to have this technology.”"

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

PM,Philip Morris International,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pb2wuY28uemEvc2F0dXJkYXktc3Rhci9uZXdzL2EtZnV0dXJlLWluLXdoaWNoLWNpZ2FyZXR0ZXMtYXJlLW9ic29sZXRlLWlzLXdpdGhpbi1yZWFjaC1zYXlzLWxlYWRpbmctaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC10b2JhY2NvLWNvbXBhbnktYmUzMTIzN2UtZjkwYi00ZGU5LTkzNDEtMGM1ZmViYzY5ZTNm0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A future in which cigarettes are obsolete is within reach says leading international tobacco company,"Johannesburg - Is it possible to live in a smoke-free world? Branislav Bibic certainly thinks so.

But the managing director of Philip Morris South Africa is convinced a lot needs to be done to achieve that goal. “The technology exists to see the end of cigarette sales but this will not happen overnight. We need to work together with other stakeholders to have the right regulatory encouragement support from civil society and the full embrace of science. A smoke-free future is possible sooner rather than later.” Japan has already set the tone with cigarette sales in the country dropping by 34 percent in the last few years.

Scientists at Philip Morris International (PMI). Supplied image. Twenty two percent of the country’s adult smokers have abandoned cigarettes and switched to smoke-free alternatives in just four years. And Bibic believes that this trend can be spread to all corners of the world. He and his company Philip Morris International (PMI) have been working hard over the last few years to achieve a smoke-free environment.

The company is a leading international tobacco company evolving its portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. The company’s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products including heat-not-burn vapour and oral nicotine products which are sold in markets outside the US. Since 2008 the company has invested more than $9 billion (about R150bn) to develop scientifically substantiate and commercialise innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes.

This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities notably in the areas of preclinical systems toxicology clinical and behavioural research as well as post-market studies. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also authorised the marketing of versions of PMI’s IQOS Platform 1 devices and consumables as modified risk tobacco products (MRTPs) finding that exposure modification orders for these products are appropriate to promote public health. Bibic says that the company is working to achieve a bold vision – to replace cigarettes with science-based smoke-free products as soon as possible – and shifting its resources and fundamentally changing its purpose and operations.

“While cigarette sales today remain the largest part of PMI’s business in most countries this is changing rapidly.” Bibic added that their flagship heat-not-burn cigarette alternative IQOS has made significant strides in Africa and their aim is to increase their IQOS user base in South Africa over the next three years. With South Africa currently being ranked among the top countries in the world in terms of smoking prevalence Bibic says it is important to address the problem with urgency.

“According to the World Population Review South Africa’s total smoking rate in the country is at 31.4 percent with 46.8 percent of smokers being male and 16 percent being female. “Misinformation is threatening public health opportunities and hampering consumer rights. There is a need to realise that it is unethical to withhold access to accurate information about cigarette alternatives that can reduce the burden of smoking on society. “We have a chance to make meaningful strides to impact public health. Addressing misinformation with facts and science is a collective responsibility to achieve a smoke-free future faster while misinformation is a persisting threat with real-world consequences for people who smoke in this country.”

Branislav Bibic managing director of Philip Morris South Africa. Supplied image. He added that too many adult smokers in SA remain unaware that better alternatives to cigarettes exist. “There is clear public demand for a collective review of the facts and science about smoke-free products. In fact according to an international survey by independent research firm Povaddo fielded among more than 44 000 adults in 22 countries including South Africa it indicates that a balanced approach is needed for tobacco harm reduction success. “Over 80 percent of all South African respondents feel that a new approach to tobacco regulation is needed with only two in 10 nicotine consumers feeling their voices are heard or considered.

“This is supported by 75% of current adult smokers in South Africa who agree that the government needs to consider the role alternative products like e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products can play in making the country smoke-free.” Bibic says that persistent misinformation is causing confusion and holding back adult smokers who do not quit from making more informed choices than continued smoking. “It’s clear that accurate information about smoke-free products plays a critical role in helping adults who would otherwise continue smoking to change to less harmful alternatives.

“Providing consumers with science-based information about better alternatives we can accelerate the decline in smoking rates helping to end the use of cigarettes once and for all.” Scientists at Philip Morris International (PMI). Supplied image. “With the right regulatory encouragement support from civil society and the full embrace of science a smoke-free future is possible in South Africa sooner rather than later with cigarette sales becoming a thing of the past.” Bibic says the draft Control of Tobacco Products and Electronic Delivery Systems Bill provides the country with an opportunity to make this a possibility by differentiating the way in which scientifically substantiated products that don’t burn tobacco are regulated compared to cigarettes.

He says his company’s main aim is to simply end the sale of all cigarettes. “Quite simply we want to end the sale of cigarettes and believe that we should stop debating on whether reduced risk products should be made available but rather how fast to best help the men and women who would otherwise continue smoking. “It’s about striving to create a better future. The millions of men and women who would otherwise continue smoking deserve better options than cigarettes.

“Smoke-free alternatives are a pragmatic solution to tackle the global challenge of smoking by helping those who don’t quit to replace cigarettes with less harmful alternatives.” Currently there are 1.1 billion smokers in the world. However these numbers aren’t expected to decrease by 2025. Bibic says this is due to the current fiscal and regulatory measures not accelerating fast enough.

“With the right regulatory encouragement support from civil society and the full embrace of science a smoke-free future is possible sooner rather than later with cigarette sales becoming a thing of the past. “Regulating smoke-free products differently to combustible cigarettes is a prerequisite to ending cigarette sales in South Africa as soon as possible. South Africa has a huge burden of tobacco use with about 12.7 million adults almost 30% of the population still using tobacco products despite being aware of the dangers of its use and exposure.” While Bibic is aware of the task they face to try and “un-smoke” the world he says they will do all they can to achieve their goal.

“Think of any industry that has undergone a seismic shift and you’ll find disruptive innovation at the source. Car manufacturers have embraced electric vehicles; wearing a mask has become part of everyday life and recycling technologies allow us to reduce more of our waste. “The tobacco industry is no different. With vast resources we’re committed to research and development to open the gateway to disruptive change in the tobacco industry. “But it’s not something we can do alone. Despite all the advances we are making we can achieve a smoke-free future faster if other companies governments regulators NGOs and public health all have a voice in the discussion and embrace positive change and drive it forward.”

He adds that it is crucial that the number of smokers drastically reduces in the next few years. “Everyone knows smoking is bad” says Bibic. “The impact on public health is significant. South Africa is currently ranked among the top countries in the world in terms of smoking prevalence. “Despite a 5-month cigarette ban during lockdown stringent smoking restrictions and pending tobacco amendment bill the country remains at twenty-three among the countries with the highest smoking rates in the world.

“It would be ideal for the world’s 1 billion smokers to quit altogether but the indicators so far show that they will not therefore the most pragmatic approach would be to use products that eliminate combustion such as e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products. “Public health experts agree that the harmful chemicals released from burning tobacco are the main cause of smoking related diseases not nicotine.” Experts agree that the harmful chemicals released from burning tobacco are the main cause of smoking related diseases not nicotine. Picture: Tracey Adams “Smoke-free alternatives generate lower levels of harmful chemicals and have an important role to play in reducing the health burden caused by smoking cigarettes.

“While we know that these products are not risk-free and are addictive the science shows that they are a much better choice compared to continuing smoking traditional cigarettes. We also believe that in addition to existing efforts to stop people from starting smoking and to help them quit offering smoke-free alternatives to adults who choose to continue smoking can also have a positive impact on public health.” He believes that society’s desire for a new approach in addressing smoking is clear and that people want change “According to the ‘New Approaches Required’ survey conducted by PMI 87 percent of adults agree that governments should consider the role alternative products can play in making their country smoke-free. Scientifically substantiated smoke-free products are a better alternative than continued smoking and embracing science and innovation represents a major public health opportunity for South Africa.”

Bibic believes that ending all cigarette sales in the next 10 to 15 years is a possibility. “A future in which cigarettes are obsolete is within reach. We believe cigarette sales can end within 10 to 15 years in many countries. Today science-based innovative products that do not involve combustion offer a better alternative for those men and women who would otherwise continue to smoke. To be clear: These products are not risk- free. And the best choice is never to start smoking or to quit tobacco and nicotine altogether. “But for those adults who would otherwise continue to smoke scientifically validated smoke-free products are a much better choice than cigarettes. Unfortunately political agendas and ideology are slowing progress and keeping millions of people uninformed. Rather than holding an evidence-based conversation on how best to regulate these innovative products to help adult smokers leave cigarettes behind we are often faced with an ideologically driven resistance from some public health organisations and some NGOs.”

PMI has enlisted top international technology and scientific talent to try and help un-smoke the world says Bibic. “The way to a better future is through innovation collaboration and transformation. We can’t achieve this without the creativity of scientists engineers and technicians.

The team joined the Bronco Overwatch and Rocket League players as the undisputed esports kings of the Mountain West. Their Spring 2022 season marks one of the best years the Bronco’s have had in the region. Unlike most tournaments the Mountain West has only one championship per year. Furthermore due to all schools being in close proximity to each other intense rivalries can form. One of these rivals is UNLV who the Broncos faced in the semi-finals and beat in a 2-0 sweep. The Bronco’s ultimately faced off against Hawaii and won in overtime in a nail biting 2-1 series.

The Mountain West has been one of the most supportive organizations when it comes to Esports. Boise State’s history with the Mountain West is quite extensive with the Bronco’s competing in a show match against UNLV all the way back near the beginning of the program. Boise State has even traveled on the road to face off in Mountain West matches heading to big names cities such as Las Vegas. Ultimately the 2022 year has been the pinnacle of many years of practice and determination for the Broncos and the perfect excuse for the writer of this news piece to use the fancy word “trifecta”.

Cypress Hill Bone Thugs-N-Harmony and Ying Yang Twins will join the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame rapper and actor on the concert showcasing legends of West Coast hip-hop.

Ice Cube aka O’Shea Jackson Sr. rose to fame as the primary lyricist and one of the rappers in N.W.A. the group that brought gangsta rap at its more hardcore out of Los Angeles to mainstream America in the late ’80s.

N.W.A.'s defining “Straight Outta Compton” recently hit No. 59 on Cleveland.com’s listing of the 100 greatest songs by Rock and Roll Hall of Fame members.

Ice Cube went solo in 1990 releasing a stream of politically and socially provocative albums starting with ““AmeriKKK’a Most Wanted” “Death Certificate” and 1992’s “The Predator."" He brought that realism to “Boyz n’ the Hood” his acting debut and went on to star in dramas thrillers and comedies including the classic “Friday” which he wrote.

On “The Predator” Ice Cube told Vibe magazine “I really just wanted to show people that I can rhyme. That it wasn’t all about controversial topics. It wasn’t just a gimmick about you know being the loudest voice or saying things that I knew that would make people react … I really had to show my MC skills. That I could pick topics from anywhere and make good records out of them.”

Ice Cube whose most recent high-profile screen appearance came in 2017’s “xXx: Return of Xander Cage” has appeared in more than 30 films since “Boyz N the Hood” from action pictures to family comedies and anchored the “Friday” and “Barbershop” franchises.

An entrepreneur as well as an entertainer Ice Cube’s most recent ventures includethe Big 3 basketball league.

Ice Cube’s latest foray into music finds him joining Snoop Dogg E-40 and Too Short in Mt. Westmore which released the album “Bad MFs” on the metaverse blockchain in June.

“We released it in the metaverse but we gonna release it in the universe coming up soon and everybody can get a chance to hear what we did"" he said. ""It was fun man. I enjoy going on stage with those dudes hanging with them dudes.”

Cypress Hill essentially a co-headliner with Ice Cube is out touring after it’s gained new attention via “Black in Black” its 10th studio album released earlier this year and the Showtime documentary “Cypress HIll: Insane in the Brain.”

The film traces the roots of LA’s longest-running most successful hip-hop group and music’s most prominent cannabis ambassadors since Bob Marley.

Formed by rappers B-Real Sen Dog Eric Bobo and producer DJ Muggs Cypress HIll released its double-platinum self-titled debut in 1991 and followed it with 1993’s triple platinum “Black Sunday.”

From the beginning the Latino hip-hop group championed marijuana from pot leaves on album covers through tracks filled with odes to THC tales of drug running and protests of harsh drug sentences to openly smoking on stage during their shows regardless of the legality.

Tickets for Thursday’s concert are $69 to $185 and are available at ticketmaster.com and on the Ticketmaster app. Tickets also can be purchased at the arena ticket office Tuesday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.

Cody Campbell calls his rapid rise in America’s hardscrabble oil patch a “wild ride”.

Little more than a decade ago when Campbell was in his late 20s he was looking for his next act. Injury had cut short a brief professional American football career and the 2008 housing crisis had driven him out of the real estate business. It was then that he returned from Indiana to his native Texas and teamed up with a friend John Sellers to start buying up drilling rights in promising oilfields to “try to make a little money”.

Neither men had much experience in America’s fiercely competitive oil business when they started. But Campbell now 40 years old says his stint in real estate helped as they acquired their first land for drilling. “We didn’t have any money. We didn’t have any employees. It was just the two of us. And there were a number of times where we sort of bet it all on individual projects. Somehow it worked out” he says.

In fact it worked out better than Campbell could have imagined. Through his firm Double Eagle Energy the company he jointly owns with Sellers he has amassed a fortune over the past decade selling oil-producing operations to bigger players. Those deals now total nearly $10bn making Campbell one of the Texas oil patch’s most prolific dealmakers of recent years.

His breakthrough sale came in 2012 when he sold a cluster of oil and gas wells in Oklahoma for $250mn to the late wildcatter Aubrey McClendon who co-founded and ran Chesapeake Energy the large energy group.

The deals have only grown since. Most recently in 2021 he and his partners who now include private equity company Apollo Global Management sold a business in the Permian basin in Texas one of the world’s largest oilfields to oil company Pioneer Natural Resources for $6.4bn. That came on the heels of a $2.8bn sale in the same area in 2017 to Parsley Energy an oil and gas producer itself later bought by Pioneer Resources. “It’s been a wild ride going from basically just a bootstrap operation where we never knew from week to week whether we were going to make it to doing multibillion-dollar transactions” says Campbell.

Campbell like others in the Texan oil industry has been investing — and taking profits — despite mounting global concerns about the impact of fossil fuel emissions on climate change. They have ploughed on even as these worries combined with growing political pressure have pushed many financial investors to reduce their commitment to the industry — and even pull out altogether.

In the US the Biden administration has cheered passage of the Inflation Reduction Act the biggest climate bill in the nation’s history which will channel $370bn into clean energy and electric vehicles over the next decade with the aim of slashing fossil fuel consumption.

President Joe Biden who once promised to transition America “away from the oil industry” called the bill the “largest investment ever in combating the existential crisis of climate change”.

At times in the years Campbell was making his fortune it seemed that sharp drops in oil prices would help climate campaigners by driving down fossil fuel production — notably at the outbreak of the Covid pandemic in 2020. The consequent lockdowns saw US oil prices even briefly falling below zero hitting a negative $37.6 a barrel as world demand suddenly dried up. Hundreds of oil companies in Texas and across the US went out of business and it was a close-run thing for many more.

Campbell says he and his partners discussed “shutting everything down” at one point during the pandemic but ultimately decided to stick to their original plans. “It was tough for everybody and we were no different it was real stressful” he says of the period.

But in the volatile markets that rule the industry prices have since bounced back dramatically. They were already on the rise throughout 2021 as global demand driven by economic recovery was growing faster than producers could bring back supply.

It’s been a wild ride from a bootstrap operation where we never knew from week to week if we were going to make it to multibillion-dollar transactions

Then in February this year Russia sent its tanks into Ukraine. The war brought havoc to commodity markets and accelerated the surge in global crude prices which rose to $129/b in March the highest level since 2008. Though they have since fallen back to around $100/b prices remain far above the $64/b average for 2019.

In Texas this surge has delivered a bonanza to those such as Campbell that have invested in the shale revolution. Big publicly listed US shale oil producers such as Pioneer Devon Energy and ConocoPhillips proxies for the rest of the shale industry are making more cash than ever before.

Political pressure on the production and use of fossil fuel looms as large as ever as highlighted by the Inflation Reduction Act. But the industry is not short of support in the US especially in the Republican party which dominates Texas. In the summer of 2020 Campbell had an unexpected call from the White House. President Donald Trump who would go on to lose the election that autumn decided to visit one of Double Eagle’s operations in Midland Texas to signal support for the domestic oil and gas industry.

The ex-president was and is hugely popular in oil country where “Make America Great Again” flags fly and “Trump 2024” bumper stickers are plastered on the back of pick-up trucks. “His support for the industry was really critical through that period” says Campbell of the man who he spent the day with.

As for the outlook now Campbell says that the high oil prices seen this year — which he argues were exacerbated but not caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — are a sign of things to come.

Companies face difficulties raising funds to develop new oil and gas projects as banks and other investors shy away from the industry over climate concerns argues Campbell. He says that the oil supply picture in the coming years “looks very bleak” and he expects it to lead to relatively high prices for the foreseeable future — which would be a financial boon to producers. “I keep thinking that the capital is going to come back with the high prices but it just seems like people are really hesitant to get back in” he says.

Billionaire oilman Tim Dunn also remains committed to fossil fuels. A Texan born and bred he has been in the industry since the 1970s and founded CrownQuest Operating based in Midland Texas in the mid-1990s. A well-known Republican he has used his oil wealth to back rightwing Republican candidates in Texas and advance conservative and evangelical Christian causes.

Dunn’s company like the rest of the industry was transformed when new shale drilling and fracking technologies helped unlock vast crude reserves in the oilfields of west Texas where his group owned vast swaths of land that had been deemed too expensive to produce. The huge Permian basin has turned from a dying oilfield into a juggernaut on global energy markets.

Dunn has expanded the business where he employs two of his sons Luke and Lee as vice presidents rapidly in recent years. It is one of the most active oil and gas drillers in Texas and operates more than 1400 wells turning out more than 115000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of oil and gas. CrownQuest ploughed more than $700mn into developing new wells in 2021 alone.

Analysts and bankers say CrownQuest which is privately held is among the most coveted Permian drillers among the larger companies that look for acquisitions in the area though Dunn has resisted selling so far. While the company keeps its finances under wraps analysts say a sale could command $5bn or more. Dunn credits a focus on “managing risks” in a relentlessly turbulent business for the success. “I think that is one reason we have survived and prospered through exceedingly choppy waters” he says.

For Dunn this year’s surging prices has added fuel to his firm’s swift growth. The company which already produces more from the Permian’s oilfields than US supermajors ExxonMobil and Chevron says it expects “significant production growth” in the coming years.

Meanwhile for Campbell the price upswing has allowed his latest start-up in the Permian to take advantage of a strong tailwind. In June his Double Eagle raised more than $1.7bn from private equity firms including Apollo and Encap along with other investors to start snapping up more development land in the Permian oilfield.

The fundraising success came despite the dearth of capital in the industry. “We’re in growth mode and we have access to capital” says Campbell of the new venture. He says he’s hunting for bigger acquisitions in Texan oilfields this time round and has assembled a group of investors that can quickly pull off big transactions. The group is ready even for a $5bn deal he says: “We’re just getting started.”

The acquisition intent is a big bet that the industry will keep making money despite the government-backed moves around the world to cut emissions and reduce the potentially disastrous effects of climate change.

The International Energy Agency predicted in a landmark report last year that spending on exploring for new oil and gas reserves would have to end now for the global economy to hit a target of achieving net zero emissions by 2050.

That said its base forecasts still see fossil fuel demand extending far into the future. And this year’s energy crisis driving fears of fuel shortages has scrambled the climate debate.

Politicians and consumers spooked by high energy prices have shifted their near-term focus from emissions reductions to securing energy supplies — even if they are fossil fuels. Despite the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act President Biden has this year asked the domestic oil industry to increase supply to help bring down high fuel prices at the pump even if it means higher emissions. In Europe some leaders now want to soften climate targets.

Hallie Templeton US-based legal director at Friends of the Earth an environmental group slams the Biden administration and the oil and gas industry for continuing to expand oil output in the face of the climate threat. “Biden needs to remove his oil-tinted glasses and start treating oil and gas development with the extreme caution it deserves” she says.

Some of the oil industry’s biggest players have started eyeing a shift to cleaner fuels. BP Shell and TotalEnergies are ploughing money into solar projects offshore wind farms batteries and electric vehicle charging networks. Even the American oil supermajors ExxonMobil and Chevron seen as more reticent to abandon oil and gas are investing in carbon capture and storage and hydrogen to try to cut their emissions and safeguard their businesses from the energy transition.

Campbell argues that the energy crisis that has roiled the global economy this year is a warning sign if leaders try to pull out of fossil fuels too quickly.

“I’m young and I have a young family and I worry about [climate change] too. But I think that there’s just a physical reality in the world that we need oil and we need natural gas. We’re seeing right now some of what happens if we don’t have it” he says

Only forced impoverishment can deliver us to a 100 per cent renewable future any time soon

Dunn is more scathing of policymakers’ approach to climate change which he argues is being used as cover to extend the reach of government power. He argues they are rushing too fast to get the world off fossil fuels which he says remains central to global wealth and wellbeing. Rather than focus on eliminating oil and gas policymakers should balance the “economic trade-offs” of cutting fossil fuel use and the potential harm from climate change. In short they should focus on adapting to a warmer world rather than try to prevent it.

“Only forced impoverishment can deliver us to a 100 per cent renewable future any time soon. Perhaps we should allow policymakers to first convert to this lifestyle and give us a full report on whether they prefer to continue in it” says Dunn.

Climate activists argue that the rapid drop in the cost of renewables and the risk of climate catastrophe mean a quick transition to cleaner energy is both needed and will ultimately be cheaper than running the global economy on fossil fuels. Yet from the Texas oilfields that transition looks a distant prospect.

Of oil Campbell says “When my kids have kids I don’t know. But certainly for the next couple of decades for the rest of my career it’s going be something that we need.”

Spence who is a senior adviser to General Atlantic LLC and chairman of the firm’s Global Growth Institute also gave his view on the biggest risks facing the global economy.

Here’s a partial transcript of highlights from the interview lightly edited for brevity:

U.S. economy

Q: Has inflation peaked?

A: Overall I think inflation has peaked but it may not settle down at an acceptable level anytime soon. There are different degrees of transitoriness if I can put it that way. A spike in a whole variety of commodities will likely abate as the system adjusts.

But we have very major changes in labor markets and in the configuration of the global economy. We went through more than two or three decades of bringing more productive capacity online in developing countries. And every time demand ramped up the supply side responded. There isn’t that degree of elasticity on the supply side anymore which means that shifting from a demand-constrained world to a supply-constrained world is almost a regime change in the global economy.

Q: Is recession fear over?

A: I think recession fear is receding but I don’t think it’s over. There are still people who are worried that inflation will be persistent enough to force the Fed to really clamp down. There’s still a non-trivial possibility that we’ll have a recession or a dramatic slowdown.

The Federal Reserve has a responsibility to get inflation down. So it will keep the pressure on but the magnitude of interest-rates increases may vary.

They take seriously their inflation mandate. They’re probably worried that their lack of concern about inflation when it started to appear caused some damage to their credibility so they don’t want to do that again. On the other hand they have a dual mandate and they definitely don’t want to crash the economy.

Q: Sentiment among investors has clearly shifted and markets are rallying. What are some of the biggest risks you’re seeing?

A: Financial markets are much more sensitive to interest rates forecasting and forward guidance. And we’re in a world in which asset prices were dramatically elevated over a long period of very low interest rates.

The rebound we’re seeing in financial markets is a rebound from fear of a very rapid and dramatic change in interest rates which would change discount rates. And when there is some evidence that perhaps the extreme scenario isn’t going to manifest then you get a fairly big financial-market reaction from it.

We’re in a world in which asset prices are going to be reset not just in public markets but in private markets where valuations have come down dramatically. There’s probably a whole collection of former unicorns that aren’t unicorns anymore.

I don’t expect these things just to collapse but an asset-price reset in the downward direction seems pretty inevitable.

Q: The U.S. labor market remains strong. What are some of the major shifts you’re expecting?

A: There have been shifts in labor-market behavior. Some people who were willing to work in a variety of jobs that were either low paying or relatively insecure are just not going back to those jobs. A lot of people are retiring because they have the assets that they think are adequate to do that. And then there’s a whole generation of people especially younger people who think lifestyle is pretty important and there are certain kinds of jobs they’re not willing to do.

Another part is labor is gaining power relative to the past and pressure from employers is diminishing. In part because of geopolitical tensions and also due to congestion in global supply chains. There is a genuine shift on the supply side in terms of who’s willing to do what kinds of work and for what kinds of compensation.

So labor is getting more powerful and my feeling is these are not temporary shifts — there isn’t an infinite supply of low-cost labor anymore. There’s a beginning of a fairly substantial regime change in the way the global economy is put together. And that would affect the labor markets for sure.

Q: What are the biggest risks for the U.S. economy?

A: The biggest risk is still the expansion of geopolitical conflict. Something going wrong in Taiwan would be a disaster. Along with it is a rising set of climate-related risks. If I had to pick one more it could be a complete loss of functionality in government. We had a pretty good run recently thanks to some leadership and politics: the infrastructure bill the semiconductor and science one — what’s encouraging is they will all involve investments that are critical for longer-term economic performance including growth and productivity.

China’s economy

Q: How long will China’s slowdown last and how can it be managed?

A: The Chinese slowdown looks to be real. That affects not only global supply chains but domestic demand. The imbalances in the real estate area are big enough to produce significant risk. I think they can manage that but in managing it that will further slow the economy down.

And then you pile on top of that the geopolitical tensions and disruption of trade flows that started on the US side with the Trump administration.

China is still doing a lot of things right — they continue to invest heavily in things that have the potential to produce a modern economy. The medium- to longer-term prospects in China are pretty good but in the short term there are pretty powerful headwinds.

Q: What are some of the most important implications for rest of the world?

A: When China slows down global growth is directly affected.

It affects trading partners and investments. And now we’re going through delisting of Chinese companies and we may get a pretty substantial separating of the Chinese and Western financial systems.

That’s not good in the short run — it makes people nervous and inhibits investment. But in the longer term that’s also a bad outcome.

Q: When will the Chinese economy start recovering?

A: I expect it will rebound in the next two to three years unless there’s bad luck. We we’re moving into an era where tech and digital are going to be regulated. China is on a similar path but it stepped into regulation in an extremely aggressive way. As a result of that I think it has diminished some of the dynamism and animal spirits in the economy in a way that might have been avoided with a slightly more thoughtful gradual approach to regulating the tech sectors.

I think once the party congress is over and the president has been put in place with a third term there’s a reasonable chance you’ll get a rebalancing of the policy agenda in the direction of focusing on economic and social progress performance. Whereas it got lost in the shuffle in the geopolitical tensions and the pandemic.

Europe UK

Q: What are your biggest concerns for the European economy?

A: In the immediate future it’s energy and Ukraine. The big shocks are likely to come this winter. If we run short of gas and start telling companies to stop operating for two days a week there’s serious potential to drag the economy down or even cause a crisis. Euro depreciation tends to produce additional inflationary pressures.

The UK seems to be in a very tough spot now. With very high rates of inflation lots of people are getting hurt.

The chances of a recession in Europe are still clearly quite high if not already in place. It’s going to be a tough period until they make the energy transition.

Global risks

Q: What are some of the biggest shifts in the global economy that concern you?

A: A very large fraction of the world is what you might call non-aligned. They don’t want to choose up sides whether it’s Russia or China and they’ve made it clear that they have not endorsed the sanctions. There’s a fairly large part of the world that doesn’t want to play the game that’s being played right now.

Whether or not that has a big economic effect is a different question. But we’ve lost a fair amount of the underpinnings of the global economy and we’re really not getting started building a new architecture. And that’s pretty important to a fairly large number of people on the planet especially in a wide range of developing economies and emerging economies.",,,,,,,,,

Near the bustling Djibouti port one of the most important ports in Africa sits a several-square-meter-large Luban Workshop a Chinese supported skill and vocational training project. Named after Lu Ban an ancient Chinese woodcraft master who was born in 507BC during China's Zhou dynasty the Luban Workshop is also Djibouti's first institute of vocational education designated to improve the professional skills of the local workforce.Liban Fouad Osman who enrolled at the Luban Workshop in 2019 the same year the institute was set up in the country is set to graduate by the end of this year after three years of intensive railway skill training. After graduating Osman along with his other 23 classmates will start working for the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway the first electrified railway in Africa constructed by a consortium formed by China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) and China Rail Engineering Corporation.Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway is a mega infrastructure project under the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the railway has fostered the development of various industries in neighboring areas which in turn calls for an amassing pool of professional workers. In the Vision 2035 put forward by Djibouti the country aims to build itself into a regional transportation hub in Africa and a logistic business and financial center in East Africa.Nurturing local talent""Students at the workshop are taught in a model called 'order-form teaching' which means that they are trained and equipped with targeted skills in collaboration with the enterprises they will work at after graduating"" Yu Zhongwu president of Tianjin Railway Technical and Vocational College (TRTVC) told the Global Times on Saturday.CCECC along with two Tianjin vocational colleges including TRTVC and Tianjin First Commercial School (TFCS) as well as the Tianjin municipal government and the Education Ministry of Djibouti jointly established the Luban Workshop which is first of its kind workshop in Africa that embodies Chinese craftsmanship.""We set up four majors at the workshop including operation and management of railway rail engineering technology business and logistics. The four majors have been certificated by local education authorities"" Yu said adding that the school blazes the trail in Djibouti's higher vocational education.Building upon an improved infrastructure network Djibouti is also constructing a free trade area (FTA) surrounding the Djibouti Port. Zhai Jingjing vice director of TFCS' financial and business institute told the Global Times on Friday that the workshop also trained talent for the FTA leveraging TFCS' expertise in business operation.Africa is rich in young and able workers and the professional training at the workshop also offers a new career path for African youth like Osman improving their future livelihoods observers said.Chinese Vice Premier Sun Chunlan announced at the opening of the World Vocational and Technical Education Development Conference (WVTEDC) on Friday in Tianjin via a video link that China will build 20 more Luban Workshops with BRI countries and set up 20 more vocational education training centers in Africa so as to ""contribute Chinese wisdom to the development of vocational education in developing countries.""In September 2018 China announced that it would build 10 Luban Workshops in Africa to provide vocational training courses to African youth as part of efforts to deepen pragmatic cooperation with Africa and support the development of Africa.'Teach them how to fish'To date China has established about 20 Luban Workshops in 19 countries and regions including Thailand the UK India Indonesia Pakistan and Djibouti. Luban Workshop has become a bridge of friendship between China and foreign countries in educational exchange.Afifa Shajia Awais the Education Attaché of the Embassy of Pakistan told the Global Times on the sidelines of the conference on Friday that Pakistan is in urgent need of more vocational training amid rapid industrialization and the set-up of more Luban Workshop is ""in line with the requirements of the industries"" which is also helpful in creating more jobs.""To develop our human resources I would stress the need for the two countries to engage more on different layers of [vocational education] and increase our cooperation opportunities"" she said.At WVTEDC's opening ceremony Sun announced that China will launch a global vocational technological education alliance to facilitate pragmatic cooperation in the sector.China also proposed to set up global vocational education reward scheme Sun said.""The Luban Workshop model exports Chinese-standard vocational education and its most important task is to train local teachers and they in turn will take the responsibilities to educate local students and this model will inject vitality to the sustainable development of local economy"" Yao Song the director of IT and automation institute under the Tianjin Light Industry Vocational Technical College told the Global Times on Friday.The college has participated in the construction of Luban Workshops in India and Egypt.As the old saying goes ""give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man how to fish and you feed him for a lifetime."" A total of 12000 people around the world have received vocational training in Luban Workshops and a total of 66 Chinese and foreign enterprises have established cooperation with Luban Workshop.At the conference industry insiders also took note of a critical role the workshop plays in securing talent that lay the foundation for carrying out BRI projects.""Most majors the workshop set up are in industries where there's a huge talent gap. In this regard it will strengthen the competitiveness of firms in those industries and promote a synergized development of local economy"" Yang Yan vice director of Tianjin Luban Workshop Promotion center said at the forum.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcHJpbnQuaW4vaW5kaWEvcmFpbHdheS1wb2xpY2UtYnVpbGRzLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtc3RhbmRhcmQtc3BvcnRzLWdyb3VuZC1pbi1tdW1iYWlzLWdoYXRrb3Bhci8xMDkyMzM0L9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcHJpbnQuaW4vaW5kaWEvcmFpbHdheS1wb2xpY2UtYnVpbGRzLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtc3RhbmRhcmQtc3BvcnRzLWdyb3VuZC1pbi1tdW1iYWlzLWdoYXRrb3Bhci8xMDkyMzM0Lz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Railway police builds international standard sports ground in Mumbai’s Ghatkopar,"Mumbai Aug 21 (PTI) The railway police has set up an international-standard sports ground in Ghatkopar in Mumbai with help from Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited and the International Amateur Athletics Federation (now known as World Athletics) a senior official said on Sunday.

Now imagine that scene taking place on a sandy beach near the ocean with a bunch of engineer space nerds.

Watermelon eating tug-of-war human pyramid and dodgeball. These are just a few competitions that are part of the annual Aerospace Games in Los Angeles where employees and interns from SpaceX Virgin Orbit Blue Origin Boeing and NASA—among many others—compete for trophies and glory.

In late July for the first time since before the Covid-19 pandemic the ""fun and family-friendly” games returned to Dockweiler Beach hosted by 2019 winner Northrop Grumman with ""30+ companies 6000+ attendees and ONE overall champion.” Hundreds of aerospace and Department of Defense workers are bused in donning colorful T-shirts with their respective employers' names plastered on the front.

Home bases were set up bright and early. Companies budgeted for boxed lunches and tables displayed satellite models and informational flyers. Walking alongside the tents Ernest Yeung a 42-year-old flight software engineer at Terran Orbital and a balloon toss competitor reminisces: “Look at all of these companies that I applied to that rejected me!” Obtaining his master's in theoretical physics in 2014 Yeung had pivoted his career from academia after being inspired by Richard Branson and Elon Musk. He taught himself programming while driving an Uber for a year handing out résumés at the SpaceX campus. Two years of applications later he received his first yes from Virgin Orbit. Pride still remains for his previous employer though he’s switched jobs and no longer competes in the relay races: “We were the third commercial space company to get to orbit after SpaceX and Rocket Lab.” The annual gathering at Dockweiler reminded him of his own journey.

“In a deep personal emotional way I knew what it was like being on the outside” he says. “For me I just feel like I made it. I’m part of this community.”

Winning involves strategy as one Reddit user posted in a 2016 thread: ""SpaceX came in first place overall after stacking their tug-of-war team with factory floor workers!"" The entire competition is based on a points allotment system where winners receive 40 total points with each team at second place and below earning fewer points in each game. Relay races have batting orders of sorts designed to ensure that no one would get tired and that time isn’t wasted on player transitions. Even with all of this strategy however the goal for many participants is not first place.

“People don't want to win first place because the first-place team has to plan next year’s Aerospace Games. So realistically you aim for second” says engineer Joan Marie Tubungbanua as she paints a red “JPL” stencil across a teammate’s face. For the past few years SpaceX and Northrop Grumman have alternated hosting duties. The 22-year-old NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) system engineer and University of Southern California masters student works on the Psyche mission to explore a metal-rich asteroid in orbit between Mars and Jupiter but today she was the wheel to the wheelbarrow duo in JPL’s lineup. Unfortunately this meant that she inhaled quite a bit of sand.

“We didn't expect the sand to be as deep as it is on the actual beach. And so we definitely had to adjust our strategy a little bit” chuckles Tubungbanua. Her teammate 19-year-old Kruti Bhingradiya a robotics intern at JPL and student from Gujarat points out that while corporate bonding games like cricket are prevalent in India the relay race in the United States was unique. “Yeah I’ve never seen baseball bats before.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

He learned it from his father a devout and generous man who often helped others. If you are blessed with talents wealth knowledge and time you are expected to help others.

Since his retirement as manager of N.C. Principal Financial Group Krumroy — whose friends and family call him Bob — devotes most of his free time and much of his financial resources towards charitable efforts benefitting underprivileged children.

As an executive he was responsible for bringing the Principal Financial Group to North Carolina building its largest operation in the U.S. and helping it become the country’s largest writer of 401K plans. His time in the financial services industry opened doors to civic leadership and put him alongside other executives with deep pockets.

While a Rotarian he worked with city officials and a group of private donors to complete a public housing renovation for residents in a blighted East Greensboro community. He also led fundraising efforts for Greensboro Beautiful from 2012-2018 securing some of its largest funding gains.

But it’s his work as president of the Bikes for Kids Foundation that drives him now. He leads the foundation with longtime friend and finance industry colleague Bill Pollakov.

Their foundation targets third-graders in Title 1 schools (those with families whose incomes are below the federal poverty level). They give more than 1600 bikes annually in Guilford County alone. Thousands more receive them throughout state and country.

While each kid gets a bike it’s more than that. It’s designed as a three-year curriculum in which their teachers lead discussions about goal-setting and what they want to be when they grow up. The students read character-building books — written by Krumroy — and write essays about their goals.

Greensboro is the program’s flagship but it’s also used in California New York Pennsylvania. Florida Tennessee and Georgia. Program expansions include Charlotte Durham Wilmington and Randolph and Carteret counties.

Krumroy ""is committed to making Greensboro a place we will all want live” says Suzanne Nazim who nominated Krumroy for the 7 Over Seventy award.

She praises his commitment to Greensboro and its underserved children. Krumroy believes that inspiring them to “Think Big Work Hard Be Kind and make NO Excuses” (the title of a book he’s written for third-graders) and continue their education beyond high school will help stop generational poverty which is the ultimate goal she says.

For all of his career accomplishments — which also include authoring nine marketing books for the financial industry — Krumroy says it’s his community work that’s been the most gratifying. He’s happiest when working to help improve the lives of others.

Once complete the building at 1714 Sixth Ave. will house a nonprofit that helps Black and brown entrepreneurs build their businesses with the help of area professionals like lawyers accountants and planners.

To help test the concept he's working with Nadia La Baker and Jambo African Cuisine helping both launch booths at the Des Moines' Downtown Farmers' Market. Ashworth said the concept appears to be working and both owners have regularly sold out of their products each Saturday.

""This has been cool to watch it work"" he said adding ""It's more fun than making money making music making whiskey."" Beyond developing Center @ Sixth Ashworth is a hip-hop artist producer and founder of Media Fresh Records and creator of Ziyad Rye small-batch whiskey.

To get the businesses going Center @ Sixth in partnership with Principal Financial Group and EMC Insurance Cos. covered up-front costs for necessities like the pop-up tents cash registers tables and signage — ""everything these businesses need to slide in and start making money"" Ashworth said. It also paid their Farmers' Market fees which can be more than $1000 said Aminatha Mkama owner of Jambo African Cuisine.

""It's helped a lot especially since I'm starting out of course"" she said. ""I would have to buy all of those things while I still invested a lot in this business.""

Mkama sells East African cuisine primarily from Tanzania where she originally was from. The main dish is a coconut cream rice filled with chicken beans and vegetables.

She said she wasn't sure Iowans would embrace her cuisine — especially at 7 a.m. — but that the customer base she built as a caterer and at festivals has grown tremendously since she started just a month ago. Last week's market was slow due to the Iowa State Fair she said but she was left with just four servings by the time the market closed.

""I am so blessed"" Mkama said. ""We have a lot of customers that we met from the festivals so I see them almost every Saturday. They're coming to pick up their lunches their dinner.""

Ashworth said Nadia La Baker which started at the market a few weeks earlier is in the same position. Owner Nadia Ahissou a French-style home baker of croissants baguettes and other pastries already has been able to upgrade her equipment and is looking for a storefront he said. could not be reached for comment.

Meanwhile Ashworth is preparing to break ground on the four-story $10 million development in the spring. The first floor will include three anchor tenants — a yet-to-be-announced local coffee shop and a restaurant as well as a tasting room for Ashworth's Ziyad Rye featuring new and favorite products plus guest pours from other Black and brown whiskey producers.

In between the anchors there will be 1000 square feet of retail space and two food stands for businesses going through the incubator. The products will rotate as businesses come in and out of the program with the idea that customers can drop by any day and find something new.

""It will be mimosas one day and samosas another day"" Ashworth said.

The mezzanine will have classrooms for the entrepreneurs to learn business skills and offices they can use. Ultimately the goal is to get business owners prepared to set out on their own whether it's in a storefront or partnering with another business. Hy-Vee has pledged to sell some of the successful products Ashworth said.

The building also will have 32 apartments with 51% of the units reserved for renters earning 80% or less of the area median income.

Center @ Sixth recently received $1.8 million in tax increment financing from the Des Moines City Council. The council also agreed to provide a $300000 match should the Iowa Economic Development Authority choose Ashworth for a grant from the state's new Nonprofit Innovation Fund. Gov. Kim Reynolds created the $20 million fund this year with federal American Rescue Plan Act money to help nonprofit organizations expand to meet the needs of Iowans.

Ashworth said he was personally invited by Reynolds to apply. Eligible expenses include costs for construction acquisition site development engineering and architectural services.

Center @ Sixth is also accepting donations through the Community Foundation of Greater Des Moines.

Construction should take about 14 months.

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks including The Procter & Gamble Company (PG) Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) and Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.



You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>



Procter & Gamble’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+9.9% vs. +8.3%). The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix along with strength across segments.



Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.



However the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues higher SG&A costs higher transportation costs and rising inflation. Its significant international presence exposes it to foreign currency risks which acts as a headwind.

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.



(You can read the full research report on Verizon here >>>)



Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year. The strong performance is likely to continue in 2024 on the back of continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume coupled with strong Ion procedure growth.



ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

Only in a bizarre Wonderland - 48 hills,"“Why sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.”

–The Queen of Hearts in Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland

San Francisco yimbys have now declared themselves “as progressive as it gets” in the welcoming pages of the San Francisco Chronicle. Claiming Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as one of their own they are now the article claims engaged in “fighting inequality to protect the most vulnerable.”

Well not really actually fighting but certainly “advancing progressive …policy goals.” The piece by Bilal Mahmood who ran for state Assembly in 2022 and lost explains that in the future will protect the most vulnerable that remain.

What are these yimby “policy goals” and just how progressive are they?

Sen. Scott Wiener with Laura Clark a yimby leader at a forum on housing

Going deeper than the self-serving rhetoric in the op-ed it becomes clear that yimbys are now attempting to consolidate their national and state-wide media and legislative influence into local political power. And in San Francisco that means cloaking deeply reactionary policy as being “progressive” because in San Francisco “progressives” have a set of housing policies that actually do protect the most vulnerable among us.

Yimby’s are pushing Proposition D claiming it is an “affordable housing” program when in fact it undermines existing affordable housing development policies by granting public funding with no public oversight to high-density housing developments serving people who earn 140 percent of regional area median income which exceeds current market rate rents in most of San Francisco.

They are doing so because in San Francisco faith and community based non-profit developers have over the last 30 years or so created a permanently affordable housing production program that in fact produces hundreds of units a year able to afforded by poor and working people and prioritizes housing the currently un-housed. Some 40000 such units have been created using a variety of direct subsidy programs most locally based more than has been created in any other Bay Area county.

While this effort falls far short of meeting the actual need for truly affordable housing yimby’s now want to convert that program into a market-rate development scheme redirecting that public money to for-profit developers.

The New York Times The Atlantic and countless academics have embraced “yimbyism” with an astounding stream of favorable articles coverage and comment by columnists. Not since the late 1950s has there been as board of a consensus among academics and the media on urban policy than that which has emerged around the two primary yimby principles: remove all local constraints and build new high density housing in urban areas letting the market solve the housing crisis by an abundant new supply—and housing costs will drop like a stone and the homeless will find a home in a condo tower.

Like the Queen of Hearts in Wonderland you must believe the impossible to accept this.

Yimbys and their allies have to overcome the reality that the two most expensive housing markets in the nation are the two most dense cities in the nation: New York and San Francisco a contradiction at the heart of their argument.

Like alcoholics who insist that drinking is not the problem but the solution to their problems yimbys argue that there simply isn’t enough high-density development and that this is because of local governments are under the total control of anti-housing forces who stop approvals of high density housing.

Here in San Francisco this core assertion—the failure to approve critically needed market rate housing—is simply a Big Lie. San Francisco has approved some 104996 housing units since 1997 (DCP Housing Inventory). In the last seven years alone it has allowed developers to build more than 150 percent of the market rate units it needed to meet its regional housing goals (while meeting less than half of it regional obligation for affordable housing).

Of the 19878 condominiums (the major form of tenure for new construction) built between 2017 and 2021 96 percent are in highrise towers of 20 units or more according to the 2021 Housing Inventory (Table 17 page 29).

Only in Wonderland can it be asserted that we are not approving enough high-density market rate housing. Have housing prices and rents fallen in San Francisco as a result of these approvals? Are the un-housed fillings these towers? Again you have to be the Queen of Hearts living in Wonderland to believe that either is true.

The assertion that opposition of current residents to expanding the supply of housing especially affordable housing is the reason we have a housing crisis is demonstrably untrue and rests on another lie: That the city is responsible for the failure to build housing it regularly approves. It turns out that the biggest obstacle to building market-rate housing is market rate developers (the chief allies of the yimbys) responding to “market dynamics.”

As of the fourth quarter of 2020 San Francisco has some 69453 units in our housing pipeline that have been approved by planning issued building permits or in the process of applying for them—but only 5509 are actually under construction.

A major reason for this is that San Francisco has the highest construction costs in the world. And these steeply rising costs have nothing to do with folks slowing approvals. Instead supply-chain bottle necks and dramatic increase in the price of steel beams rebar and concrete all needed for high density high-rise construction are the culprits making new construction a very problematic solution to our housing crisis—a point never ever mentioned by yimbys.

It’s the “market” that determines the pace of for-profit development for the simple reason that unless there is a clear profit to be made the housing is not built. As interest rates increase de-regulated land increases in price construction costs and materials prices soar public subsidies look more tempting for these for profit developers and their yimby advocates.

There’s another huge structural issue never addressed by the yimbys simple minded mantra of build build build: the financialization of the housing market and the impact that has on vulnerable urban populations.

Yimbys pretend that all the housing that is built in cities will be owned by folks who need housing and those people will live in them. In this Wonderland hedge fund managers are never mentioned as flippers of housing. Wall street firms never create financial instruments pool them together and then buy and sell thousands of bundled mortgages resting on mountains of debt.

In Yimby Wonderland the “Great Recession” of 2008 simply never happened. In the real world by 2016 the issue of corporate control of housing was of such size and import that the United Nations appointed a Special Rapporteur to investigate and report on the problem.

The 2017 report renders laughable the yimby mutterings. Among other things it finds that “housing and commercial real estate have become the “commodity of choice” for corporate finance and the pace at which financial corporations and funds are taking over housing and real estate in many cities is staggering.”

In what sounds like everyday life in every neighborhood of San Francisco the reports states: “In “hedge cities” prime destinations for global capital seeking safe havens for investments housing prices have increased to levels that most residents cannot afford creating huge increases in wealth for property owners in prime locations while excluding moderate- and low-income households from access to homeownership or rentals due to unaffordability. “

The report urges that states no longer be “too deferential to the dynamics of markets” and to take steps to “bring private investment into line with the right to adequate housing” by working ” in collaboration with affected communities” by providing “access to credit” which “allows low-income households to finance construction…”

This sounds remarkably like community efforts here in San Francisco to create a municipal bank impose restrictions on market excesses organize community and faith based nonprofit profit housing developers and create though legislation new sources of affordable housing financing.

Guess who is absent from each of these initiatives and indeed opposes measures to accomplish these tasks as being harmful “impediments” to the construction of high-density market rate housing? Yimbys.

Yimbys deplore neighborhood and community-based organizations endlessly attack their leadership online disrupt press conferences and oppose effective advocacy for affordable housing—which often time means opposing high density market rate housing developments.

Even the Chronicle had to admit that the Mission’s getting some 649 units of permanently affordable housing required community based groups led by PODER and others organizing “fierce community opposition…that derailed market-rate developers in order to satisfy the city’s affordable housing requirement.”

None the less yimbyism continues to thrive at the state and national level as academics and elite media continue to ignore inconvenient facts and fail to study or understand actual community-based efforts to develop affordable housing. Ezra Klein the New York Time columnist and yimby booster (who says he believes that Gavin Newsom is a politician of “redeeming substance”) hypes a new yimby variant he calls “supply- side progressivism”.

Ignorant of (or more cynically ignoring) actual community struggles to increase the supply of affordable housing fought in San Francisco over the last 30 years like that most recently fought in the Mission Klein asserts that the “left” only concerns itself (“most of the time”) with programs that aim at “giving people money” while being “uninterested in the creation of the goods and services they want everyone to have.” And then in a blindingly ignorant assertion he states “…in California… progressives talked often of making housing affordable…but they didn’t talk much about increasing housing supply!”

Increasing the supply of permanently affordable housing is all that progressive San Francisco housers have been talking about for 30 years. And they have brought most San Francisco voters along with them. They have sent until recently one elected official to Sacramento after another to demand more funding for affordable housing production.

They wrote and passed the first general obligation bond ever used in the state for the expressed purposed of building new affordable housing. They devised legislation that created a new supply of middle income below-market-rate units to be required of market rate developers (legislation to increase the amount of BMR was consistently opposed by the yimbys).

They devised a tax measure on the biggest corporations in San Francisco to pay for the development of new housing able to be afforded by homeless people. And this year alone they have proposed Proposition E  a density bonus for market rate developers that require significant affordable housing as a necessary condition of getting the density bonus so much so that the yimbys are suing the measure to keep it off the ballot SF Democratic Socialists of America clear supporters of progressive housing policy have drafted and got on the ballot Proposition M which will tax vacant units often times owned by hedge funds and corporations that earmarks 50 percent of the tax to increasing the supply of permanently affordable housing while providing the other 50 percent for rent subsidies for seniors.

Between 2018 and 2020 San Francisco voters passed four measures raising a combined $1.5 BILLION for the expressed purpose of increasing the supply of affordable housing with one of the measures— Prop C of 2018—adding an additional $300 million annually significant portions of which is dedicated to increasing the supply of permanent affordable housing for un-housed San Franciscans. Which is why SF yimbys have placed on the ballot a measure to divert that public subsidy to market rate development.

As mentioned above yimbyism has created a consensus at the elite media and academic level not seen since the 1950s. That predecessor consensus was built around “urban renewal.” All of the same kinds of academic experts and elite media opinion makers including SPUR) agreed that the happy convergence of state-mandated entities able to override local zoning and approvals (redevelopment agencies) using state and federal authority and funding could in one massive effort reverse two decades of urban neglect (the Depression followed by the war saw virtually no urban investment especially in housing) and produce a new urban core devoted to commerce with the residential uses moved to the country-side linked to the urban “central business district” by freeways.

A perfect unity was created: freeways linking suburbia to a re-developed central city. What could possibly go wrong?

How the new consensus of the elite around “yimbyism” is to avoid the errors and disasters of the urban renewal period is impossible to see since its advocates take no notice of that history. What is absolutely clear about “yimbyism” is that its advocates have no actual experience with “protecting the vulnerable” in an urban context and indeed the core of their policy—the unfettered development of high-density market rate housing—is the primary threat facing vulnerable urban populations.

A very real indication that yimbys learned nothing from the history of urban renewal can be seen in their co-opting of the of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) concept of “social housing” as represented by Silicon Valley DSA backed Assembly member Alex Lee’s AB 2053 which died in committee this last June.

What is startling is that DSA also seemed to have learned nothing from the urban development wars of the last century either. The year-long advocacy by yimbys for the bill shows how eager they are to secure public funding for market rate development that threatens existing affordable housing production and how dangerously clueless a California Assembly member who claims to be a socialist is about the issue.

AB 2053 “The Social Housing Act “ (Text ) is co-optation of DSA’s contribution to the current housing policy debate the confused abstract and itself un-historical concept of “social housing”. Based upon a study done in 2018 by an Irish Social Democrat researcher Saoirse Gowan and US journalist Ryan Cooper (Social Housing in the United States) “social housing” was quickly adopted by DSA the center piece of its housing policy.

The basic problem with the 2018 study is its total lack of any discussion of lessons learned from any actual urban housing movements or policy debates in the United States over the past fifty years a rather striking oversight. Indeed for Gowan and Cooper there is no history of community organizing or policy proposals addressing housing even worthy of mention in their study.

The lessons of countless community struggles against urban renewal are not mentioned. The discussion of housing policy in the paper is at 30000 feet oddly absent of any discussion of history or political detail of the countess local and community battles around housing.

For example while the paper never mentions that the Black Panther Party’s Ten Point Program includes two (four and ten) that directly relate to housing and housing policy and that sparked scores of community based efforts to restructure housing policy at the local level in many major cities in the United States ( including San Francisco Oakland and Los Angles) it spends an inordinate amount of space discussing housing policy in Vienna Finland and Sweden whose homogenous and overwhelmingly white combined population (17.5 million) is less than half of the wildly heterogeneous and totally mixed population of California.

None of those three countries had state power handed over to the private sector for-profit developers as happened in the United States under urban renewal. Nor did they have the history of popular resistance to that effort and the necessary politicalization of housing development that resulted. It is hard to imagine three less typical “case studies” to base a US housing policy on than Vienna Finland and Sweden.

For Gowan and Cooper and for Assemblymember Lee” social housing” means producing housing that is “economically integrated” that includes both poor and wealthy people in the same building with internal subsidies between the two.

For Gowan and Cooper “the worst social ill in American cities” is “concentrated poverty” which produces “higher crime…drug abuse gang violence and a host of other problems.” A major cause of this “concentrated poverty” is “poor only public housing” that is housing programs that only target the poor.

The argument is clear if wrongheaded: it is as important to eliminate “concentrated poverty” in housing programs by designing in “economic integration” as it was to eliminate “slums and blight” by designing urban renewal programs. The intent of both programs is not to bring housing rights and resources to poor communities but to disperse them to bring higher class residents culture and economic activity to “enlighten” a culture of poverty an incredibly condescending and reactionary formulation. By ignoring urban history they repeat it.

“Social housing” is simply the term used in Great Britain and the European Union for “affordable housing” and can take many forms from publicly built and managed housing developments to rent subsidy programs to publicly funded limited equity and co-op owned housing. These programs almost universally include income limits for residents just as they do in the US. It is interesting to note that the Thatcher government did in public housing in Britain by making a similar argument: that it was insufficiently economically integrated and that current residents needed to be “empowered” to own the public assets privately opening up a wave of speculation that lured most residents to sell their units ending its affordability forever.

But for Gowan and Cooper social housing must include two essential qualities: It must result in new construction and the buildings must be economically integrated to avoid the ills of “concentrated poverty.” They argue that rent control and inclusionary zoning are simply unacceptable because rent control discourages new construction (a bogus argument usually advanced by the real estate industry and certainly not the case when new construction is explicitly exempted as in San Francisco) and inclusionary zoning usually contains specific income limits and thus risk producing “concentrated poverty.”

In a recent panel discussion in which Peter Cohen then co-director of the Council of Community Housing Organizations and Lee participated Lee stated that he was “bored” with housing programs that had Area Median Income limits on participation a position at odds with the SF DSA branch as their Proposition M limits recipients of the vacant unit tax proceed to assisting household earning no more than 80 percent AMI. It seems that there is a rather significant “county option” in DSA as to what is a truly “socialist” housing program.

AB 2053 was initially endorsed by several yimby front organizations and then quickly co-sponsored by yimby-endorsed Scott Weiner in the state Senate. At its heart the bill as introduced was all that yimbys have demanded in Sacramento: It would have created a state wide agency (“California Housing Authority”) able to overrule or ignore local housing policy and issue debt for new housing construction. And like their previous state victories it was linked to regional housing targets as the agency’s “core mission” was to “produce and acquire social housing developments for the purpose of eliminating the gap between housing production and regional housing needs assessment targets and to preserve affordable housing.”

From the start the measure goes way off track. Note the agency “core mission” is not to INCREASE the supply of affordable housing but to “preserve” it that is not necessarily increase it at all. Instead the core mission is to make sure that counties meet their “housing needs assessment targets”. These targets are overwhelmingly market-rate units and thus AB 2053 sees “social housing” as being overwhelmingly “market rate.”

To make the point absolutely clear Section 64724 (a) states “in all its operation the authority seeks to achieve revenue neutrality over the long term.” The bill defines “revenue neutrality” as “a system in which all monetary expenditures that result from the development and operation of social housing owned by the authority are returned to the authority through rents payments on leasehold mortgaged or other subsidies.” (64672). So “revenue neutrality” uses a “system” that is the same as a capitalist bank which is an odd formulation for any kind of socialist but easily embraced by a yimby.

What makes this social housing legislation work to make the entire operation “revenue neutral” is “rent and mortgage cross-subsidization” the true heart of Lee’s social housing concept. The legislation defines cross-subsidization” as “a system in which below-cost rents and leasehold mortgages of certain units are balanced by above cost payments on other units within the same multi-unit property so as to ensure the property’s overall revenue meets development and operational costs.”

It is clear that in San Francisco for example the Community Land Trust has worked well dealing with keeping existing tenants in an existing building when the building is threatened with being sold and the tenants evicted. In most cases tenants of these buildings pay varying amounts in rent depending on the length of time each spent in the building given the fact that rents are “de-controlled” when a tenant leaves. It is equally clear that these various rents payments do act as an internal “subsidy” allowing the CLT to get a commercial mortgage at a rate that will keep most tenets at the present rent payments.

But the CLT buys the building with a public subsidy paying market price. Since the subsidy does not have to be paid back the CLT can structure a new mortgage for less than it paid for the building passing the savings back to the tenants in the form of existing or near existing rents and saving them from being evicted.

How “cross-subsidization” would work in the saving of an existing buildings when the market purchase price has to be fully repaid is unclear. The legislation allows for some tenants to be removed so the assumption appears to be that the poorer tenants leave the better off stay.

The “core mission” of the authority is not to expand affordable housing by the acquisition of existing buildings but to “close the gap” on meeting regional housing goals in each jurisdiction which means new construction. How “cross subsidization” works in new construction is a mystery. Other than an embrace of an ethics rarely found in real estate what program elements motivate an “above market” housing shopper to pay more for a similar unit in a new building than a low-income resident would pay in the same building? The bill offers some sweeteners as suggestions: above market owners can lease out the unit (perhaps on Airbnb?) while the lower income tenant must prove continued residence. The bill offers high income owners the right to sell their publicly developed unit for an amount that includes not only the original price any capital improvement inflation AND a “reasonable return on investment.”

It seems then that the primary inducement for cross-subsidization is the same as it is for any real-estate investment: Profit—a truly odd formulation for a socialist even one from Silicon Valley.

But the real indication that nothings has been learned by Assembly “socialists” or yimbys from the hard lessons of urban real estate development wars and the battle with urban renewal can be found in section 64742 of the bill. In that section are the priorities to be used by the authority in “acquiring or reacquiring property”—the true “business end” of the legislation. Five priorities are listed but only one has the possibility of meeting the scale of development needed to close the “gap” between what is built by the private sector and what is required in the regional housing targets for all of the state’s counties.

The four that if achieved would produce land and housing far below the necessary level set in the legislation are acquiring existing affordable and rent controlled units “in danger of losing affordability status” buying “parcels at risk of becoming unaffordable” “surplus public properties” and “parcels near transit.”

Note that two don’t even attempt to expand affordable housing but simply preserve it. Most large cities have programs to do the same thing and this simply duplicates them but would then establish a “revenue neutral” policy that currently is not the case in San Francisco. Acquiring “parcels near transit” would be if funded potentially land for a large number of units especially in San Francisco and other urban areas with transit and none in the posh suburbs of many legislators in Sacramento. It would also mean a major wave of evictions and demolitions as most transit lines serve existing residential neighborhoods.

But the “priority” for the California Housing Authority that should grab our attention is “Underutilized parcels or redevelopment of underutilized parcels with affordability covenants or rent controlled units.” The bill defines “underutilized parcel” as “a parcel of property upon which is built a structure that contains fewer units permissible under local zoning regulations.”

This is a rather disingenious definition as the state as recently pre-empted all local zoning classifications with mandatory density bonuses which render ALL residences in existing zones being ones that “contain fewer units” than allowed.

Thus the stage is set for a new period of “urban renewal” this time under the banner of “social housing” being developed by a state agency. Indeed the actual language—“redevelopment of underutilized parcels”—is the same as used in the urban renewal period. And being a state housing authority just like the old redevelopment agency created and finally killed by state law in 2012 it has the right of “eminent domain” or the ability to condemn private property with the ruling of a single judge; no jury no trial.

Housing developed using public money in San Francisco does not have to be “revenue neutral.” Indeed the only way truly affordable housing can be produced is if the public money used in its development does not have to be repaid. Affordable housing development must pay market rates for land labor professional services (architects engineers lawyers etc.) and building materials. The community-designed affordable housing system in San Francisco uses public money mainly locally generated—allocations from the general fund development fees on office developers general obligation bonds fees on hotel and condo conversions large real estate transfers—to “write-down” those fixed market costs so that monthly rents or mortgage payments are able to be afforded by lower income households defined by area median income. The public development subsidy makes costs affordable only if it is a true subsidy not to be repaid.

Based upon these proven policies and programs San Francisco’s DSA Supervisor Dean Preston authored a local “Housing Stability Fund” ordinance which specifically funded the development of social housing and which was not linked to new construction regional housing targets did not require the housing to be revenue neutral limited it to being 100 percent affordable to households earning no more than 80 percent of area median income does not require “cross-subsidization” and no “reasonable rate of return on investment” when an owner sells a unit purchased with public funds.

As the private for-profit housing market sees its costs dramatically rising its allies the yimbys have turned to seeking public funding of market rate development at both the state (AB 2053) and the local levels (Prop. D) . Aided by a willing chorus of elite opinion makers and careerist state legislators and ignoring the hard-won success of local community and neighborhood housing advocates yimby are transforming themselves into “progressives” to legitimize the raid on public funding.

In some cases it has resulted in naive and inexperienced politicians being willingly enlisted in their Alice in Wonderland formulations. So are the yimbys the new “progressives? Certainly one California Assembly “socialist” seems to believe so. And so too does at least one socialist congressmember from New York City.

Dressing like it’s 1999 is now cool say owners of new vintage shop

The premise for a Progressive Insurance TV commercial is a life coach who helps prevent home buyers from becoming their parents. In terms of style however becoming your parents is now cool part of a Y2K nostalgia that continues to rule in vintage.

“A lot of people like to dress like their parents now” said Kevin Dong who opened Paisley Vintage with his brother Michael a year ago. “Anything 20 to 30 years old is resurfacing.”

That means knitted sweaters with collars or crew necks in argyle or graphic prints ($25-$30) or mesh and lace tops ($14-$22). The store’s most popular items across the board: vintage T-shirts with graphic nature or cartoon images ($18-$30).

The brothers are 20-somethings who both trained at UCLA as engineers (Kevin in mechanical; Michael in biomedical) and live in Concord. During the pandemic they got the idea of turning their hobby into a more permanent business. They had done vintage sales previously in Berkeley and thought that the city’s demographic chock full of college shoppers made it the perfect place for their first brick-and-mortar store.

Their 800-square-foot storefront steps from campus also happens to be near two popular eateries that create foot traffic: Great China and U Cha bubble tea. Maybe that’s why business has been a lot better than the brothers expected.

“A lot of the Cal students have been repeat buyers which helps a lot” Kevin said. The brothers don’t do a lot of social media so word is spread the way their parents did it. “We get a lot of our customers by word of mouth” Kevin said “which is pretty awesome.”

The YWCA Berkeley/Oakland hired Jennifer Radics-Johnson as executive director in April. She left the organization after three months saying that her departure was not the result of a bad fit but bad timing. A job she had applied for before joining the Y came through and it was closer to her children’s preschool.

“I love the mission of the YWCA Berkeley/Oakland and in the short amount of time I was there the way I view the world as well as myself have been transformed” she said. “I will continue to support the YWCA and the great work that they do.”

Taking the helm of the Y’s leadership on Aug. 16 will be Freda Statom-Greene who brings more than 20 years’ experience in the nonprofit sector and with organizations whose missions and goals are similar to those of the 133-year-old nonprofit.

“We look forward to Freda’s vision and passion to help us with this important work” Marilyn Cleveland the Y’s board president said in a statement.

Statom-Greene who grew up in San Diego came to the Bay Area to attend UC Berkeley in 1984 where she majored in interdisciplinary studies. “I just fell in love with the Bay Area” she said and Oakland in particular where she now lives.

Most recently Statom-Green was director of strategic partnerships and development for Blueprint Schools Network a national organization dedicated to educational equity in charge of five regions across the country including Oakland and Pittsburg California. She previously served as regional executive director of the Jefferson Awards Foundation which aims to develop the next generation of service leaders. She has a certificate in fundraising management from Indiana University Center of Philanthropy and served on the advisory boards of the Hidden Genius Project and the Black Female Project. She is an active member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority.

“The YWCA Berkeley/Oakland has an impressive track record of being laser focused on their mission of eliminating racism and empowering women” Statom-Greene said. “I’m looking forward to working alongside the board of directors the staff and building upon the legacy of my predecessors.”

As to her plans for the Y she doesn’t have any – yet: “I’m still learning the landscape.”

Pacific Center for Human Growth historic LGBTQ center to have its home razed

The Pacific Center for Human Growth has to leave the building it’s called home since 1978. Credit: Joanne Furio

“We’re definitely not closing” said Lasara Firefox Allen the executive director of the Pacific Center for Human Growth the third-oldest LGBTQ community center in the U.S. and one of the largest serving 630 people. The center which has been operating mostly remotely since the pandemic also operates the only sliding-scale mental health clinic serving the LGBTQ community in Alameda County.

In a July email Allen notified stakeholders that the two-story clapboard building the center has occupied since 1978 has been sold to Panoramic Interests a developer of many Berkeley-based projects. Panoramic plans to raze the building and replace it with a five-story apartment building with 35 units three of which would be reserved for very low-income renters according to an application filed in August. The development would include 2000 square feet of commercial space on its ground floor.

“Heartbreaking as it is to lose a location that has so much connectivity for folks I think ultimately the move will benefit the center in many ways” Allen said in a phone interview. “We may find a space that suits our needs better.”

The center conducted a survey on Aug. 1 and found that one of the main complaints was that the current location is not entirely accessible though it does have a ramp.

Allen estimates that the organization will probably have to move by next summer “at the soonest.” She said Panoramic Interests has been “a good citizen” and told the center it can stay from one to five years in its current building. The developer has also offered to rent the center a space in its new building whenever that is completed.

“We’re still in the discovery stage” Allen said. One thing’s for sure: “We’re definitely going to stay within the city limits of Berkeley.”

When Solar Car Wash opened in 1974 its water was heated by solar power. Such technology has since become outdated. The 2434 San Pablo Ave. car wash closed in late November and has since been razed. The owners plan a new state-of-the-art express car wash that will open in June 2023.

“It’s going to be a modern full-tunnel express car wash with 18 vacuum stations” said Shel Givens who is partners with Robert Zweben.

The new facility will have a new name Solar Express Car Wash and will be outfitted with a solar array covering the entire roof of the car wash tunnel.

Givens suggests that customers who miss the San Pablo location can visit Solar Car Wash on 1198 University Ave. at Curtis Street which he and Zweben also own.

Last fall Wine.com pulled out of its 81000-square-foot Berkeley warehouse and distribution operation after 14 years in that location. In a November announcement the nation’s largest online wine seller based in San Francisco revealed it had opened a new “fulfillment center” in San Leandro double the size of the Berkeley warehouse to serve customers across the western U.S.

During the pandemic as wine sales surged nationwide Wine.com reported $165 million in revenues for the fiscal year 2020 a 25% increase over 2019 the largest one-year gain in the company’s history according to Wine.com’s website. For fiscal year 2021 the company announced $355 million in revenue a 115% increase over the previous year.

Between June 2021 and June 2022 average rent shot up by 66 percent to $5500 the New York Times reports. New Jersey’s second-largest city with a population just under three hundred thousand is seeing a “spate of new luxury apartments luring New Yorkers across the Hudson River with more space and amenities than they could afford near their offices.” As a result rent is skyrocketing across the board and working-class tenants are beginning to feel the squeeze. But the corporate-developer-driven agenda for Jersey City is facing pushback from grassroots organizers. If real-estate interests are trying to put Jersey City on the map as a shining example of a luxury commuter city socialists and progressives are attempting to put it on the map as an equally shining example of what effective resistance can look like.

Sleaze Prevails Overlooking the Statue of Liberty Jersey City has long been known as the “Golden Door” to working-class immigrants. It consistently ranks among the most diverse cities in the country often in the top spot. Amid the population boom and industrial growth of the mid-nineteenth century Jersey City corporate and political elites captured the new wealth created by an influx of new laborers from around the world. In the early twentieth century Jersey City was dominated by Mayor Frank Hague or “Boss Hague” whose cartoonish corruption lives on in the enduring trope of the New Jersey political machine as seen for example in the HBO show Boardwalk Empire. Ruling Jersey City from 1917 through 1947 the Democratic Party boss played kingmaker for governors and senators and allied with the Chamber of Commerce to fight the “Red Communists” of the CIO. At the same time “Hague enticed sweatshop factories fleeing nascent unionization out of New York City while also allowing the American Federation of Labor to organize more skilled workers on a strict no-strike agreement” write Mary Rizzo and Whitney Strub in the Washington Post. Today Democratic mayor Steven Fulop governs a rapidly developing Jersey City. After leaving his job with Goldman Sachs and getting elected in 2012 in a bid supposedly against the “Jersey City political machine” Fulop now courts corporate real estate just as Hague courted factories and he heads a city government worthy of all New Jersey-sleaze stereotypes. “Favoring tax incentives and less cumbersome regulation” notes Bloomberg Fulop “has been a boon for developers including Mack-Cali Lefrak China Overseas America and Hartz Mountain which have constructed tens of thousands of new living units.” By canceling a property tax reevaluation soon after entering office Fulop quickly proved himself an ally of real estate companies like Dixon Advisory — which is not only landlord to scores of Jersey City residents but also sold Fulop his current home and donated $300000 to the mayor’s PAC when Fulop eyed a run for governor. Meanwhile a former adviser to Fulop is soon headed to trial having been indicted for tax evasion while expediting development permits.

According to a statement from State House Mr Museveni met the NRM Parliamentary Caucus on August 19 at Kololo Ceremonial Grounds where he said only profit-making parastatals should be spared.

Citing an example of the National Enterprise Corporation (NEC) the commercial arm of the Uganda People’s Defence Force Mr Museveni said apart from research institutions and farmers’ institutions the government is seeking to retain only money-making parastatals.

“If the government wants to have parastatals have money-making parastatals so that when you say you have got a board it is a money-making board; not a money-eating board. Have no board where there is no money making” he said.

The most recent Auditor General’s report indicated that only 13 out of the 26 public corporation and state enterprises analysed made profits. Some included Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Ltd (UETCL) Uganda Electricity Generation Company Ltd (UEGCL) and National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC) which posted profits of Shs112 billion Shs91.9 billion and Shs47.8 billion respectively. These however were not paying any dividends to the government.

The Public Service ministry in 2018 released plans to realign government ministries departments and agencies (MDAs) to address challenges of duplication of work overlaps of mandates conflicts and wasteful expenditures among others.

In February 2021 Cabinet approved a roadmap for rationalisation of government agencies commissions authorities and public enterprises.

Mr Museveni’s impromptu meeting with the legislators comes two months after the House through a report by an Ad Hoc Committee raised concern about the impact of the proposed rationalisation of government agencies urging the ministry to protect employees whose agencies have been affected.

Parliament where NRM has majority seats criticised the ministry for reportedly embarking on the mergers without a comprehensive study of the whole government machinery for service delivery limited consultation on the legal and economic costs involved and without a business continuity assurance study.

Parliament had given Mr Muruli Mukasa the Public Service minister two months to revert with a better plan.

Mr Museveni on Friday however made a case for the proposed mergers whose aim the government says is to save the country billions of shillings.

“The total cost savings arising from the rationalisation of 53 government agencies and functions per annum will be Shs649b” Ms Mary Grace Mugasa the junior Public Service minister revealed adding that the money to be saved includes savings from expenses on wage facilitation of governing boards and councils NSSF contributions non-wage expenses development expenditure gratuity and rent.

Ms Mugasa explained that out of 157 government agencies which were reviewed in 2018 the government took a decision to retain 88 and merge mainstream and transfer the functions of 69 agencies.

The first phase of the rationalisation exercise has been concluded with 53 out of the 69 government agencies harmonised while the 16 will be rationalised in phase two of the next financial year.

She argued that some of the agencies were created without clear justification while others had their mandates overtaken by events.

“There are agencies that naturally should not be affected like Bank of Uganda Mulago hospital Micro Finance Support Centre Uganda Development Bank [and] Uganda Revenue Authority [among others]” Mr Paul Omara (Otuuke County) said adding “The President is now accelerating because in his view the money is not available… This makes economic sense. For instance UNRA apart from just doing procurement and then passing money to the contractors there is no value for money that they add. This can be handled as a department under the ministry of works.”

Whereas the government indicates that billions of shillings will be saved Mr Godfrey Wakooli (Butiru County) says emphasis should be placed on where such saving will be.

“I feel this should not stop there but there should be a follow up on these monies that they are planning to save” Mr Wakooli said adding “During Covid a lot of money meant for meetings was saved but we were not told where the money went”

The lawmaker also demands that a further audit be conducted to put a figure to the money that government would save by collapsing so-called superfluous agencies.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This is for pre-trial conference.



Sade Kwate’e had already pleaded not guilty to one count of Sedition two counts of unlawful assembly and one count of arson at a previous court date.



The charges relate to incidents on 24th and 25th of November 2021 in Honiara.



The prosecution alleged that on 24 November Kwate’e led a group of people to protest at the Parliament House to demand the Prime Minister to step down.



Then on the next day Kwate’e allegedly assembled a group of people and procured them to set fire to the Naha Police Station at Naha.



This was at the height of the three days of violence in Honiara which left the city’s Chinatown in ruins and business houses and shops in Honiara looted and set on fire.



The Bank of South Pacific (BSP) branch at Ranadi Kukum Traffic Centre and part of Honiara High School were also burnt to the ground.



The Naha Police Station was ransacked and also set on fire but the fire was put out by the Naha community.

State and local officials plan a groundbreaking ceremony Monday for the Maine International Cold Storage Facility a 107000-square-foot building sited on Commercial Street next to Maine's sole shipping container terminal. The warehouse has been touted as critical to expanding freight through Portland and giving Maine food and beverage companies a competitive edge and access to markets.

Pandemic disruptions delayed permitting and construction plans but also demonstrated a continued need for refrigerated storage in Maine said Matt Burns executive director of the Maine Port Authority. ""We have always known there is significant demand for cold chain logistics. Cold storage has always been part of the master plan"" Burns said. ""That demand for food and beverage products and cold storage did not decline and wane during the pandemic it seemed to get stronger.""

Plans for the warehouse were approved by the Portland Planning Board nearly two years ago. The building price has grown from $30 million to $55 million. Construction is expected to finish early in 2024.

The warehouse is a public-private partnership between the port authority and developers Amber Infrastructure Group an international company with headquarters in London and Treadwell Franklin Infrastructure a financing company based in Yarmouth. The state of Maine contributed $8 million to the project money dedicated to preparing the property for building. The warehouse will sit on leased state land.

Plans were approved but a lengthy permitting process went into 2022 said Tom O'Shaughnessy co-founder of Amber Infrastructure. Through permitting the project was redesigned to lower the building height to 55 feet move refrigeration and mechanical systems to face the port and modify the Commercial Street frontage O'Shaughnessy said.

""At every step of the way we were able to address concerns and improve the building at the same time"" he said.

A large rooftop solar array is planned for the project and projected to generate enough electricity to provide 20 percent of the warehouse's energy use.

Since it was first proposed in 2015 the cold storage project faced stiff opposition from West End neighbors concerned its height would block harbor views and increase traffic on outer Commercial Street. An original proposal from Americold a major refrigerated storage company was shelved in 2018 after a lengthy and contentious zoning and planning process. Cold storage plans were revived the same year with a public-private partnership between the state and developers.

Refrigerated storage next to the International Marine Terminal container port will likely draw new customers including clients of Eimskip the Icelandic shipping company that specializes in transporting cold and frozen freight O'Shaughnessy said. Since starting trips to Portland in 2013 Eimskip the sole company landing at the terminal has increased freight volume by 20 percent on average per year with almost 38200 containers crossing the Portland docks last year.

Though Eimskip's clients are likely users of the 21750 pallet-space warehouse there will be no reserved space for any user and Maine companies will be encouraged to take advantage of the infrastructure O'Shaughnessy said. ""There is almost an inevitability that the clients Eimskip will bring into the port will use cold storage"" he said. But ""no customers have guaranteed space or priority space in the facility it's open to everyone.""

A cold storage building is the latest in a series of upgrades transforming the container terminal from an abandoned space Portland used for a snow dump to a hive of activity. More investment is planned in coming years to accommodate more containers allow larger ships and lure shipping companies to port said Burns the port authority director.

""I think bottom line we are open for business. Any carrier that wants to move containers and freight through International Marine Terminal we are open to that"" Burns said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vY29iYmNvdW50eWNvdXJpZXIuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvaGVyZS1hcmUtdGhlLTU1LW5ldy1idXNpbmVzc2VzLWxpY2Vuc2VkLWJ5LWNvYmItY291bnR5LW92ZXItdGhlLXBhc3Qtc2V2ZW4tZGF5cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here are the 55 new businesses licensed by Cobb County over the past seven days,"Here are the 55 new businesses listed by Cobb County with licenses taking effect August 14 to 21.

Led by former Warburg Pincus executive Joseph Gagnon who is now a partner at Hillhouse’s New Infrastructure division Hillhouse Real Asset Opportunities Fund (RAOF) is targeting investments in new economy-related property assets and platforms across Asia Pacific with the Hillhouse team having closed its fund raising shortly after the end of the second quarter.

Records from the Cayman Islands show that the fund was first registered there on 16 June 2021 with a separate feeder vehicle set up one week later. Reuters had reported plans for the fund in March of last year while representatives of Hillhouse which was founded in 2005 by former Yale investment officer Zhang Lei declined to comment on the fund raising when contacted by Mingtiandi.

In addition to the commingled fund public filings indicate potential sidecar investments or special mandates although no further information on these ancillary vehicles was available at the time of publication.

Sheds and Hospital Beds

The first investments under Hillhouse’s RAOF fund are said to be in the logistics sector with the vehicle also targeting life sciences assets and other investments receiving a boost from tech-enabled tenants.

During his time at Warburg Pincus Gagnon specialised in platform investments and was involved in establishing e-Shang one of the predecessors of ESR as well as D&J one of the forerunners of mainland industrial platform DNE Group among other deals. The Hillhouse vehicle is also said to be backing platform investments and local entrepreneurs.

Headquartered in Singapore the fund and its leadership team are targeting investments in North Asia including mainland China Southeast Asia and other parts of the region.

Asia’s Biggest Investor

Before setting up its first property fund Hillhouse had backed the $11.6 billion privatisation of GLP in 2017 and last year together with Warburg Pincus led a $700 million investment in JD.com’s JD Property spin-off.

Founded by Zhang Lei in 2005 with seed capital from the Yale University Endowment Hillhouse has been active across sectors including buying Philips Domestic Appliances from its Dutch parent firm last year in a $4.4 billion deal.

The firm had a reported $73.3 billion in assets under management as of 31 July last year and with completion of its $18 billion fifth flagship buyout fund last year manages Asia’s largest private equity vehicle.

The company was an early investor in Tencent Holdings and one of the first backers of e-commerce giant JD.com."

Bloomberg reports that the processor was built by Nuvia which the company acquired for $1.4 billion last year.

Qualcomm is talking to cloud and data center companies about testing an Arm chip for the server market.

Qualcomm previously tried to enter the Arm server market with the well-received Centriq 2400 but laid off its Arm team as it recovered from a failed hostile takeover by Broadcom and fought its largest customer Apple in court. That team went on to primarily be hired by Microsoft which is thought to be developing its own Arm chips.

After the layoffs in 2018 Qualcomm stuck to smartphones and other low-power devices. That same year several Apple veterans launched Nuvia to build Arm chips for the server market - but when Qualcomm acquired it they claimed they were pivoting the tech back towards mobile IoT and networking products.

That appears to not be the case with the company shopping around a server product. Prior to its acquisition Nuvia had planned to offer a product by 2022.

The chip will compete against cloud providers' own Arm processors such as AWS' Graviton line and rival Arm company Ampere. It will also compete with traditional x86 chips from Intel and AMD.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3RlYm9va2NoZWNrLm5ldC9UU01DLWlzLW5vLXNhdmlvci1mb3ItUXVhbGNvbW0tZWl0aGVyLVNuYXBkcmFnb24tOC1HZW4tMS1pbi10aGUtT25lUGx1cy0xMFQtcHV0LXRvLXRoZS10ZXN0LjY0MjAxMi4wLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TSMC is no savior for Qualcomm either: Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 in the OnePlus 10T put to the test,This phenomenon may have been partly due to dynamics in Samsung's production process but our review of the OnePlus 10T reveals that the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 has not fundamentally solved the problem of heat development.

In addition it is also believed the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra will also utilize Qualcomm’s 3D Sonic Max fingerprint sensor and feature faster storage.

It appears Samsung is preparing to stuff its Galaxy S23 Ultra flagship smartphone full of mouth-watering delights that will prevent the Android-smartphone buying public from being tempted by anything running on iOS. We have already reported several times about the 200 MP lens that is expected to land in the S23 Ultra’s camera equipment and this has now been confirmed in a report by ET News which states:

Samsung Electronics' Mobile Experience (MX) division shared confirmed information with major camera partners that it will install a 200-megapixel camera on the Galaxy S23 recently.

The 200-megapixel camera is only destined for the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra model apparently but its use here will also result in the sensor becoming more widespread throughout the Android OEM community. But it takes more than a potentially hit-or-miss 200 MP camera to make a flagship smartphone the new standard so it seems Samsung has also recruited Qualcomm’s 3D Sonic Max fingerprint sensor for inclusion as well.

The 3D Sonic Max fingerprint reader which will also only be headed to the Galaxy S23 Ultra covers a larger area than other sensors and can read two fingers at the same time thus offering a greater level of security. As pointed out by the source Alvin (@sondesix) it is already in use in phones like the Vivo X80 Pro and iQOO 9 Pro and it includes anti-spoofing technology to guard against those who think they can get round its advanced sensing system.

If those weren't enough exciting prospects for the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra yet another leaker has offered up a couple of vague but still interesting rumors about the future flagship which should turn up in the first quarter of 2023. Anthony (@TheGalox_) reckons fans can also expect a “new battery process” and “faster storage” in the top-end Galaxy device. Potentially this could mean that the S23 Ultra will sport UFS 4.0 storage which not only should be up to twice as fast as UFS 3.1 but should also be much more power efficient. A denser battery would allow for higher capacities without the need for larger cells.

The couple obtained a marriage license back in July during an impromptu ceremony in Las Vegas but the wedding festivities are far from being over. The duo continued the celebrations by throwing an exclusive party on Affleck’s estate in Riceboro Georgia over the weekend. According to TMZ the Georgia estate holds a special meaning for the two: they originally were supposed to tie the knot here after Affleck proposed in 2002 but the couple broke up in 2004. For the momentous occasion Lopez debuted her wedding dress — a lavish couture gown by Ralph Lauren — that was no less memorable and noteworthy than the two bridal looks she wore in Vegas.

The actor’s third bridal outfit was a custom turtleneck dress with short flutter sleeves an open back and a skirt with tiered all-over ruching and a dramatic flowing train. According to a statement released by Ralph Lauren over 1000 handkerchiefs and 500 meters of fabric were cut into ruffles to create its voluminous hem. Lopez completed the look with an even longer cascading veil which was held in place by an ivory-hued headband and a pair of pearl earrings plus two pearl rings by MIKIMOTO. As for Affleck he opted for a sleek tailored ensemble that comprised a cream-colored dinner jacket a narrow piqué bib shirt and black trousers accessorized with black patent leather shoes and a black bow tie.

On The JLo

Now the plot twist: J.Lo wore two additional gowns also custom-made by Ralph Lauren as she and her guests — all dressed in white — attended cocktail hour a dinner and a fireworks display after the ceremony. One of them was a dazzling gown embellished with Swarovski crystals and thousands of cascading strings of pearls which she teamed with a pair of crystal-embellished Maisel sandals by Jimmy Choo. The other dress had a mermaid silhouette and featured a Swarovski crystal-embellished keyhole neckline as well as an organza overlay. In case you didn’t know Ralph Lauren has always been Lopez’s trusty go-to so it’s no surprise that she elected the designer to be her designated bridal couturier.

To recap the couple’s wedding wardrobe also included a traditional ‘60s-inspired wedding dress and an extravagant elaborately embellished off-the-shoulder bridal gown. The former according to J.Lo’s newsletter came from an old movie while the latter was designed by the Lebanese couturier Zuhair Murad. And now although Lopez and Affleck’s wedding celebrations have come to an end there’s no doubt that their matching couple outfits will continue to pop up in pap photos and on social media.

Lopez 53 tapped Ralph Lauren for her three immaculate wedding gowns which all took an incredible amount of work and care.

The ruffled handkerchief dress she wore down the aisle was a reimagination of a turtleneck column sheath according to a press release from the brand. Complete with over 1000 handkerchiefs and 500 meters of fabric the ruffled cap sleeves and voluminous ruffle-tiered train were meant to evoke the romantic sensibility of the fashion house. The mermaid-style silhouette came complete with an open back and sheer 20-foot veil that began at the crown of her head and highlighted her slicked-back updo all the better to catch a glimpse of her Mikimoto pearl drop earrings.

Lopez then switched into a second gown that was completed by 30 artisans across 700 hours and essentially saw her dripping in pearls and Swarovski crystals all of which were strung onto micro-pleated silk tulle fabric and finished with the same earrings and a pair of Jimmy Choo Maisel sandals.

Lopez's final Ralph Lauren look also took a mermaid shape and spoke to her brand of sporty glamour with its sheer organza hood and keyhole neckline adorned with Swarovski crystals around the trim. For this moment Lopez accessorised with $2 million worth of rare diamonds from Samer Halimeh thanks to her 27-carat one-of-a-kind pear-shaped drop flower marquise earrings.

Affleck 50 wore an ivory tuxedo jacket over a crisp white shirt with a button hole flower to match Lopez's intricate mossy green bouquet. His look was finished with black slacks and patent loafers accented by a black bow-tie.

The rest of the wedding party included Lopez's 14-year-old twins Max and Emme and Affleck's kids Violet 16; Seraphina 13; and Samuel 10. The five children were also spotted wearing all-white.

Lopez who also worked with Ralph Lauren on her memorable look for the 2021 Met Gala chose Zuhair Murad for her more intimate ceremony in Las Vegas on 16 July later changing into an Alexander McQueen dress at the chapel which was a costume she had saved from the 2004 romantic comedy ""Jersey Girl"" which she starred in alongside Affleck.

With five separate bridal looks under her belt all selected in collaboration with Lopez's longtime stylists Rob Zangardi and Mariel Haenn Lopez more than impressed on her special day.

The 37-year-old enjoyed a brief period at the pinnacle of the sport before he quickly became a laughing stock after suffering a string of knockout defeats.

Rockhold first made a name for himself in Strikeforce the initial home of some of MMA’s biggest stars such as Ronda Rousey Daniel Cormier and Nick Diaz.

In 2011 the California native became the company's middleweight champion by beating Ronaldo ‘Jacare’ Souza before defending his belt twice against top opposition in Keith Jardine and Tim Kennedy.

A UFC move followed and despite suffering a shock KO defeat against Vitor Belfort who was infamously jacked up on TRT at the time Rockhold quickly became a force in the middleweight division.

After stopping Costas Phillipou Tim Boetsch Michael Bisping and Lyoto Machida in successive fights Rockhold earned himself a shot at the 185lb title held by Chris Weidman.

The American Kickboxing Academy fighter made it look easy against Weidman who had no answer for his top game before being stopped inside four rounds at UFC 194 in December 2015.

Rockhold appeared to be set for a long reign as champion but this is where his story took a turn. With the fame came outside influences that in hindsight appear to have had a detrimental impact on his fight career.

The 6ft 3in American was signed to a modelling agency and began subsidising his UFC income with work outside of fighting and he ultimately found success with it – bagging himself a contract with Ralph Lauren in 2018.

During this time Rockhold enjoyed a brief romance with popstar Demi Lovato. They officially announced their relationship when they attended UFC 205 at New York City's Madison Square Garden before amicably parting ways a few months later.

It quickly became clear that Rockhold’s new lifestyle did not mesh with being a UFC champion when he was famously knocked out by Michael Bisping who is not known as a power puncher and took the fight on a few days’ notice.

‘The Count’ verbally destroyed Rockhold on the mic in the build-up to UFC 199 and ridiculed him in the octagon post-fight something which only added to the humiliating upset loss.

While most fighters who had just lost their belt against someone they were expected to beat would be crying out for a rematch the former UFC middleweight champion was content to continue making money without getting hit in the head.

“It’s about making the right move next and making it worth my while I’m not going to just go out there and put my body on the line when I can get paid that much more in this world [modelling]"" Rockhold said on The MMA Hour in September 2016.

A 15-month layoff followed Rockhold’s defeat to Bisping and he has never really looked the same since despite managing to get back in the win column against David Branch in his comeback fight.

The first time he faced any real opposition he crumbled and was once again knocked out cold this time by the muscle-bound Cuban wrestler Yoel Romero.

After spending his entire career at middleweight the MMA star attempted something new for his next fight and moved up to light-heavyweight to take on Jan Blachowicz.

The man who went on to win the 205lb title after it was relinquished by Jon Jones put Rockhold to sleep inside two rounds and left the former middleweight king contemplating his future in the sport.

Three years later and after lots of time spent flirting with the idea of retirement Rockhold is finally set to return to fighting when he takes on top middleweight contender Paulo Costa at UFC 278 this weekend.

It’s certainly a tough return opponent for Rockhold who will surprise many if he is able to stand up to the punching power of ‘Borrachinha’ as he has one of the best KO records at the weight in recent years.

If victorious the former champion would have a solid case for another title shot and set himself up for the most unlikely redemption story after years of poor form and humiliating defeats.",,,
RJF,Raymond James,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhbXBhYmF5LmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvYnVjcy8yMDIyLzA4LzIwL2JlaW5nLXRvbS1icmFkeXMtYmFja3VwLWhhcy1icm91Z2h0LXN0YWJpbGl0eS1pZi1ub3Qtc25hcHMtdG8tYmxhaW5lLWdhYmJlcnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Being Tom Brady's backup has brought stability if not snaps to Blaine Gabbert,"TAMPA — Back when he was finding zero traction in his NFL career cycling through one coordinator a season and hearing fans and pundits cast dispersions Blaine Gabbert would just well cast.

Streams became his sanctuary offseason fly-fishing his decompression. The technique involves some physics a sliver of science and a bit of artistry. In fact the prerequisites for successfully hooking cutthroat trout in the western Wyoming stretch of the Snake River provide a metaphor for Gabbert’s professional life.

“It’s patience” Gabbert said after a recent practice at AdventHealth Training Center. “And it’s more finesse. It’s not like you’re bottom-fishing or trolling it’s all placement presentation so there’s a lot of work that kind of leads up to it all.”

Entering his fourth season in Tampa Bay Gabbert hasn’t budged from the spot he assumed upon his arrival: One heartbeat — or change of heart in the case of Tom Brady — from taking the wheel of the Bucs offense.

While patience hasn’t necessarily fostered tranquility it has borne stability. Saddled with a different offensive coordinator each of his first nine NFL seasons Gabbert has spent nearly a half-decade in his current system.

During Brady’s extended training-camp absence for what has been described as “personal reasons” Gabbert has been the Bucs’ starter by default both in the preseason opener against the Dolphins and in joint practices with the Dolphins and Titans.

“It’s been great for him mentally” Bucs coach Todd Bowles said Thursday at the end of the second joint workout with Tennessee.

“The plays might not be there all the time but the mental reps and what he’s getting and making the right play is very important not just making a ‘wow’ play. He’s been making the right plays so it’s been great to have him there.”

Before signing with the Bucs in March 2019 Gabbert spent the 2017 season in Arizona where current Bucs coordinator Byron Leftwich was his position coach and current Tampa Bay run-game coordinator Harold Goodwin served as head coach Bruce Arians’ coordinator.

Before that one has to backpedal to Gabbert’s college career at Missouri (2008-2010) where he threw for nearly 7000 yards and led the Tigers to a pair of bowl games to find a stretch where he had the same coach or coordinator in back-to-back seasons.

“You look back in 2017 it’s like you’re studying every night learning the formations just trying to keep your head above the water” said Gabbert who has attempted 27 regular-season passes in a Bucs uniform.

“And now you have more freedom. You know exactly what you want to get to how to get to it where are we supposed to be when they’re supposed to be there. You can really take that next step in not only your own maturation process of playing football but helping the young guys. That’s what I enjoy the most really today.”

Learning the languages

Know this: Had Brady remained retired Gabbert almost certainly would’ve inherited his job and Arians still would be coaching him if for nothing more than to prove Gabbert’s competence as a starter and to spite the rest of the league.

For years now Arians has sworn by the guy fans once enjoyed swearing at. At 32 Gabbert still brandishes the velocity befitting a No. 10 overall draft pick (in 2011). And during this haphazard NFL journey he has acquired a degree of moxie and locker-room respect.

“Blaine’s my guy” Bucs second-year receiver Jaelon Darden said. “He kind of took me under his wing and helped me with the offense for sure. My first year here he was definitely getting me in the right spot because I was all over the place but it’s definitely been a blessing learning from him because he’s a great quarterback as well.”

All of which may prove that spin rate is rendered moot without stability and that not even generational quarterbacks can elevate franchises that whiff on personnel decisions and go through coaches like sneakers. Until arriving in Tampa Gabbert annually was learning new systems on the fly if not on the run.

“I always try and equate it to just learning a new language every year” said Gabbert 13-35 in his career as an NFL starter. “And then you have to speak that language when 11 guys on defense are running after you full-speed. So things aren’t necessarily clicking as fast as they should be. It’s not truly muscle memory when you’re always still trying to just learn.”

His head coaches have ranged from Jim Harbaugh (49ers 2014) to Jim Tomsula (49ers 2015). His collection of coordinators has included Dirk Koetter (Jaguars 2011) Geep Chryst (49ers 2015) and Matt LaFleur (Titans 2018). In one six-season span Gabbert played on five teams that lost at least 10 games.

“People may not like the overall record but Blaine had eight head coaches and eight coordinators his first eight years” Arians said earlier this year. “He beat Jacksonville their best year (in 2017 while with the Cardinals) and beat Tennessee their big year for us in Arizona (also in 2017). And he’s been in the system now.”

32 going on 25

That newfound stability has brought not only peace but preservation. The flip side to existing in Brady’s shadow: Minimal wear on the body. And like many inside AdventHealth Training Center Gabbert has embraced the TB12 method and its emphasis on hydration pliability and nutrition among other Brady tenets.

Moreover he just became a dad. His wife Bekah a former Missouri basketball player gave birth to the couple’s first child — daughter Leyton — earlier this summer.

“Really the last few years I’ve taken kind of the whole TB12 process to heart” said Gabbert who enters 2022 with a 56.3-percent career completion rate with 50 touchdowns and 47 picks. “I’m big I’m strong I’m fast but there was always something missing. I need to be more flexible more durable so you don’t have the muscle strains.

“Everybody’s different everybody’s body responds to different treatments or different trainings differently but for me personally that’s what’s worked for me the best and I feel better than I did at 25. And I’m 32.”

Now it’s just a matter of exercising that patience fostered in those frigid streams. Time technique and placement could yield one more whopper of an opportunity perhaps in Tampa.

And perhaps sooner rather than later.

“We have such a great group of guys great coaching staff great front office” Gabbert said. “It’s a lot of fun to come to work. I don’t even call it work it’s just hanging out with the guys every day and hopefully I can stay here a lot longer.”

The matchup will conclude a long week between the teams which had joint practices Wednesday and Thursday at Saint Thomas Sports Park. It marked the second straight year of practices between the clubs.

Coach Mike Vrabel said Thursday he hadn't made a decision on who will start at quarterback though he acknowledged that rookie Malik Willis has been eating into Logan Woodside's reps in recent practices for development purposes.

A third-round pick Willis started in the Titans' preseason-opening loss to the Ravens completing 6-of-11 passes for 107 yards and rushing five times for 38 yards and a touchdown.

""We've had conversations with Logan about his opportunity to compete but I also feel like we have to see how quickly we can bring Malik along"" Vrabel said.

Tennessee Titans vs. Buccaneers score live updates

Fourth quarter

FINAL: Titans 13 Bucs 3

10:32 left: Ryan Stonehouse drops the snap in punt formation but outraces the Bucs' frontline for a first down. Good instincts for the UDFA punter I guess?

11:33 left: Treylon Burks and Jalen McKenzie each called for holding on a solid run by Julius Chestnut on a third down carry. Meanwhile Reggie Roberson has four catches for 47 yards tonight.

14:54 left: Logan Woodside is intercepted. Deep ball intended for Treylon Burks. Not the best preseason for the Titans' backup QB.

Third quarter

1:27 left in the third quarter: Treylon Burks has his first catch of the preseason on a short route along the right sideline.

Titans 13 Bucs 3 with 2:20 left in the third: Ryan Succop is good from 52 yards out.

3:40 left in the third quarter: Ke'Shawn Vaughn has had a good quarter carrying 8 times for 50 yards. The cart is out for former Titans offensive lineman Aaron Stinnie who has played a lot for the Bucs tonight. Lower-body injury.

7:34 left in the third quarter: Ola Adeniyi strips Kyle Trask on third down. Trask recovers but it's a 21-yard loss and a sack credited to Adeniyi. Logan Woodside coming into the game at QB for Tennessee.

9 minutes left in the third quarter: Kyle Trask just made an excellent throw on the move for 35 yards. Had room to step up in the pocket.

10:41 left in the third quarter: Ke'Shawn Vaughn in the game for Tampa Bay trying to battle for a reserve running back role. The former Vandy star bursts through the middle for 17 yards.

12:50 left in the third quarter: Ryan Stonehouse punts the ball out the back of the end zone. The UDFA punter has a big-time leg. Note on the previous drive: Mason Kinsey had a drop and Malik Willis scrambled himself into a sack instead of throwing the ball away on third down.

Start of quarter: Malik Willis remains in the game to start the third quarter.

Second quarter

26 seconds left in the first half: Malik Willis cashes in on the turnover doing well inside the pocket to find Chig Okwonkwo for a 6-yard touchdown pass. Some juice on that throw too. Titans lead 13-0.

1:44 left in the first half: A non-Titans tweet: Kyle Trask has not improved through two preseasons with the Bucs. Still lacks NFL-level poise and pocket presence for a QB.

On cue Trask throws an interception under pressure.

4:14 left in the first half: Randy Bullock is good from 49 yards. Titans lead 6-0. Tennessee's offensive line including potential starters Dillon Radunz and Nicholas Petit-Frere has struggled in pass protection.

5:11 left in the first half: Recent addition Lonnie Johnson forces a fumble that is recovered by Rashad Weaver. Johnson has made a couple good plays in the first half.

5:58 left in the first half: Willis has to throw the ball away while scrambling on third down. Randy Bullock's 32-yard field goal is good. Points! Titans lead 3-0.

8:38 left in the first half: Malik Willis scrambles for 26 yards. Looked very comfortable in the pocket against the blitz and made a smooth run down the right sideline.

9:22 left in the first half: That's at least two run-option carries for Malik Willis tonight. He has four total carries so far.

12:26 left in the first half: There's the Malik Willis sidearm throw again. He finds Dez Fitzpatrick for a first down reception.

13:45 left in the first half: Caleb Farley playing in the second quarter and just made a good play on the ball to force a third-down incompletion.

14:49 left in the first half: Malik Willis throws a ball off target for an open Chig Okwonkwo on 4th down. Neither team's reserve QBs are comfortable just yet.

First quarter

2:27 left in the first quarter: Kyle Philips has a future at punt returner. 35-yard return his second good return of the quarter. (And then he was called for a false start on the next play.)

4:02 left in the first quarter: Titans first-team offensive line started the game but the OL are rotating through after three possessions. Taylor Lewan sat out that drive and is likely done for the day.

5:28 left in the first quarter: Second-year edge rusher Rashad Weaver earns a sack. Titans defense started the game with a mix of starters including Bud Dupree and Kristian Fulton and backups.

7:36 left in the first quarter: Titans defense gets a stop on fourth down against Bucs QB Blaine Gabbert but go three-and-out as Willis is sacked on second down. Still scoreless.

11:06 left in the first quarter: Malik Willis starts the first drive of his second NFL preseason game with a good throw to Nick Westbrook-Ikhine and finishes it with a 4-yard loss on a run on fourth down. Good and not-so-good from the rookie.

Nvidia has long been the dominant player in the graphics card market but the company has from time to time been put under serious pressure by its main rival AMD which has launched several of its own iconic GPUs. Those only set Nvidia up for a major comeback however and sometimes that led to a real game-changing card.

It was hard to choose which Nvidia GPUs were truly worthy of being called the best of all time but I’ve narrowed down the list to six cards that were truly important and made history.

GeForce 256

The very first

Although Nvidia often claims the GeForce 256 was the world’s first GPU that’s only true if Nvidia is the only company that gets to define what a GPU is. Before GeForce there were the RIVA series of graphics cards and there were other companies making their own competing graphics cards then too. What Nvidia really invented was the marketing of graphics cards as GPUs because in 1999 when the 256 came out terms like graphics card and graphics chipset were more common.

Nvidia is right that the 256 was important however. Before the 256 the CPU played a very important role in rendering graphics to the point where the CPU was directly completing steps in rendering a 3D environment. However CPUs were not very efficient at doing this which is where the 256 came in with hardware transforming and lighting offloading the two most CPU intensive parts of rendering onto the GPU. This is one of the primary reasons why Nvidia claims this is the first GPU.

As a product the GeForce 256 wasn’t exactly legendary: Anandtech wasn’t super impressed by its price for the performance at the time of its release. Part of the problem was the 256’s memory which was single data rate or SDR. Due to other advances SDR was becoming insufficient for GPUs of this performance level. A faster dual data rate or DDR (the same DDR as in DDR5) launched just before the end of 1999 which finally met Anandtech’s expectations for performance but the increased price tag of the DDR version was hard to swallow.

The GeForce 256 first of its name is certainly historical but not because it was an amazing product. The 256 is important because it inaugurated the modern era of GPUs. The graphics card market wasn’t always a duopoly; back in the 90s there were multiple companies competing against each other with Nvidia being just one of them. Soon after the GeForce 256 launched most of Nvidia’s rivals exited the market. 3dfx’s Voodoo 5 GPUs were uncompetitive and before it went bankrupt many of its technologies were bought by Nvidia; Matrox simply quit gaming GPUs altogether to focus on professional graphics.

By the end of 2000 the only other graphics company in town was ATI. When AMD acquired ATI in 2006 it brought about the modern Nvidia and AMD rivalry we all know today.

GeForce 8800 GTX

A monumental leap forward

After the GeForce 256 Nvidia and ATI attempted to best the other with newer GPUs with higher performance. In 2002 however ATI threw down the gauntlet by launching its Radeon 9000 series and at a die size of 200mm squared the flagship Radeon 9800 XT was easily the largest GPU ever. Nvidia’s flagship GeForce4 Ti 4600 at 100mm had no hope of beating even the midrange 9700 Pro which inflicted a crushing defeat on Nvidia. Making a GPU was no longer just about the architecture the memory or the drivers; in order to win Nvidia would need to make big GPUs like ATI.

For the next four years the size of flagship GPUs continued to increase and by 2005 both companies had launched a GPU that was around 300mm. Although Nvidia had regained the upper hand during this time ATI was never far behind and its Radeon X1000 series was fairly competitive. A GPU sized at 300mm was far from the limit of what Nvidia could do however. In 2006 Nvidia released its GeForce 8 series led by the flagship 8800 GTX. Its GPU codenamed G80 was nearly 500mm and its transistor count was almost three times higher than the last GeForce flagship.

The 8800 GTX did to ATI what the Radeon 9700 Pro and the rest of the 9000 series did to Nvidia with Anandtech describing the moment as “9700 Pro-like.” A single 8800 GTX was almost twice as fast as ATI’s top-end X1950 XTX not to mention much more efficient. At $599 the 8800 GTX was more expensive than its predecessors but its high level of performance and DirectX 10 support made up for it.

But this was mostly the end of the big GPU arms race that had characterized the early 2000s for two main reasons. Firstly 500mm was getting pretty close to the limit of how large a GPU could be and even today 500mm is relatively big for a processor. Even if Nvidia wanted to making a bigger GPU just wasn’t feasible. Secondly ATI wasn’t working on its own 500mm GPU anyway so Nvidia wasn’t in a rush to get an even bigger GPU to market. Nvidia had basically won the arms race by outspending ATI.

That year also saw the acquisition of ATI by AMD which was finalized just before the 8800 GTX launched. Although ATI now had the backing of AMD it really seemed like Nvidia had such a massive lead that Radeon wouldn’t challenge GeForce for a long time perhaps never again.

GeForce GTX 680

Beating AMD at its own game

Nvidia’s next landmark release came in 2008 when it launched the GTX 200 series starting with the GTX 280 and GTX 260. At nearly 600mm squared the 280 was a worthy monstrous successor to the 8800 GTX. Meanwhile AMD and ATI signaled that they would no longer be launching high-end GPUs with big dies in order to compete rather focusing on making smaller GPUs in a gambit known as the small die strategy. In its review Anandtech said “Nvidia will be left all alone with top performance for the foreseeable future.” As it turned out the next four years were pretty rough for Nvidia.

Starting with the HD 4000 series in 2008 AMD assaulted Nvidia with small GPUs that had high value and almost flagship levels of performance and that dynamic was maintained throughout the next few generations. Nvidia’s GTX 280 wasn’t cost effective enough then the GTX 400 series was delayed and the 500 series was too hot and power hungry.

One of Nvidia’s traditional weaknesses was its disadvantage when it came to process the way processors are manufactured. Nvidia was usually behind AMD but it had finally caught up by using the 40nm node for the 400 series. AMD however wanted to regain the process lead quickly and decided its next generation would be on the new 28nm node and Nvidia decided to follow suit.

AMD won the race to 28nm with its HD 7000 series with its flagship HD 7970 putting AMD back in first place for performance. However the GTX 680 launched just two months later and not only did it beat the 7970 in performance but also power efficiency and even die size. As Anandtech put it Nvidia had “landed the technical trifecta” and that completely flipped the tables on AMD. AMD did reclaim the performance crown yet again by launching the HD 7970 GHz Edition later in 2012 (notable for being the first 1GHz GPU) but having the lead in efficiency and performance per millimeter was a good sign for Nvidia.

The back and forth battle between Nvidia and AMD was pretty exciting after how disappointing the GTX 400 and 500 series had been and while the 680 wasn’t an 8800 GTX it signaled Nvidia’s return to being truly competitive against AMD. Perhaps most importantly Nvidia was no longer weighed down by its traditional process disadvantage and that would eventually pay off in a big way.

GeForce GTX 980

Nvidia’s dominance begins

Nvidia found itself in a very good spot with the GTX 600 series and it was because of TSMC’s 28nm process. Under normal circumstances AMD would have simply gone to TSMC’s next process in order to regain its traditional advantage but this was no longer an option. TSMC and all other foundries in the world (except for Intel) had an extraordinary amount of difficulty progressing beyond the 28nm node. New technologies were needed in order to progress further which meant Nvidia didn’t have to worry about AMD regaining the process lead any time soon.

Following a few years of back and forth and AMD floundering with limited funds Nvidia launched the GTX 900 series in 2014 inaugurated by the GTX 980. Based on the new Maxwell architecture it was an incredible improvement over the GTX 600 and 700 series despite being on the same node. The 980 was between 30% and 40% faster than the 780 while consuming less power and it was even a smidge faster than the top-end 780 Ti. Of course the 980 also beat the R9 290X once again landing the trifecta of performance power efficiency and die size. In its review Anandtech said the 980 came “very very close to doing to the Radeon 290X what the GTX 680 did to Radeon HD 7970.”

AMD was incapable of responding. It didn’t have a next-generation GPU ready to launch in 2014. In fact AMD wasn’t even working on a complete lineup of brand-new GPUs to even the score with Nvidia. AMD instead was planning on rebranding the Radeon 200 series as the Radeon 300 series and would develop one new GPU to serve as the flagship. All of these GPUs were to launch in mid 2015 giving the entire GPU market to Nvidia for nearly a full year. Of course Nvidia wanted to pull the rug right from under AMD and prepared a brand-new flagship.

Launching in mid 2015 the GTX 980 Ti was about 30% faster than the GTX 980 thanks to its significantly higher power consumption and larger die size at just over 600mm squared. It beat AMD’s brand-new R9 Fury X a month before it even launched. Although the Fury X wasn’t bad it had lower performance than the 980 Ti higher power consumption and much less VRAM. It was a demonstration of how far ahead Nvidia was with the 900 series; while AMD was hastily trying to get the Fury X out the door Nvidia could have launched the 980 Ti any time it wanted.

Anandtech put it pretty well: “The fact that they get so close only to be outmaneuvered by Nvidia once again makes the current situation all the more painful; it’s one thing to lose to Nvidia by feet but to lose by inches only reminds you of just how close they got how they almost upset Nvidia.”

Nvidia was basically a year ahead of AMD technologically and while what they had done with the GTX 900 series was impressive it was also a bit depressing. People wanted to see Nvidia and AMD duke it out like they had done in 2012 and 2013 but it started to look like that was all in the past. Nvidia’s next GPU would certainly reaffirm that feeling.

GeForce GTX 1080

The GPU with no competition but itself

In 2015 TSMC had finally completed the 16nm process which could achieve 40% higher clock speeds than 28nm at the same power or half the power of 28nm at similar clock speeds. However Nvidia planned to move to 16nm in 2016 when the node was more mature. Meanwhile AMD had absolutely no plans to utilize TSMC’s 16nm but instead moved to launch new GPUs and CPUs on GlobalFoundries’s 14nm process. But don’t be fooled by the names: TSMC’s 16nm was and is better than GlobalFoundries’s 14nm. After 28nm nomenclature for processes became based in marketing rather than scientific measurements. This meant that for the first time in modern GPU history Nvidia had the process advantage against AMD.

The GTX 10-series launched in mid-2016 based on the new Pascal architecture and TSMC’s 16nm node. Pascal wasn’t actually very different from Maxwell but the jump from 28nm to 16nm was massive like Intel going from 14nm on Skylake to 10nm on Alder Lake. The GTX 1080 was the new flagship and it’s hard to overstate how fast it was. The GTX 980 was a little faster than the GTX 780 Ti when it came out. By contrast the GTX 1080 was over 30% faster than the GTX 980 Ti and for $50 less too. The die size of the 1080 was also extremely impressive at just over 300mm squared nearly half the size of the 980 Ti.

With the 1080 and the rest of the 10-series lineup Nvidia effectively took the entire desktop GPU market for itself. AMD’s 300 series and the Fury X were simply no match. At the midrange AMD launched the RX 400 series but these were just three low to mid-range GPUs that were a throwback to the small die strategy minus the part where Nvidia’s flagship was in striking distance like with the GTX 280 and the HD 4870. In fact the 1080 was nearly twice as fast as the RX 480. The only GPU AMD could really beat was the mid-range GTX 1060 as the slightly cut down GTX 1070 was just a little too fast to lose to the Fury X.

AMD did eventually launch new high-end GPUs in the form of RX Vega a full year after the 1080 came out. With much higher power consumption and the same selling price the flagship RX Vega 64 beat the GTX 1080 by a hair but wasn’t very competitive. However the GTX 1080 was no longer Nvidia’s flagship; with relatively small die size and a full year to prepare Nvidia launched a brand-new flagship a whole three months before RX Vega even launched; it was a repeat of the 980 Ti. The new GTX 1080 Ti was even faster than the GTX 1080 delivering yet another 30% improvement to performance. As Anandtech put it the 1080 Ti “further solidifie[d] Nvidia’s dominance of the high-end video card market.”

AMD’s failure to deliver a truly competitive high-end GPU meant that the 1080’s only real competition was Nvidia’s own GTX 1080 Ti. With the 1080 and the 1080 Ti Nvidia achieved what is perhaps the most complete victory we’ve seen so far in modern GPU history. Over the past 4 years Nvidia kept increasing its technological advantage over AMD and it was hard to see how Nvidia could ever lose.

GeForce RTX 3080

Correcting course

After such a long and incredible streak of wins perhaps it was inevitable that Nvidia would succumb to hubris and lose sight of what made Nvidia’s great GPUs so great. Nvidia did not follow up the GTX 10 series with yet another GPU with a stunning increase in performance but with the infamous RTX 20 series. Perhaps in a move to cut AMD out of the GPU market Nvidia focused on introducing hardware accelerated ray tracing and A.I. upscaling instead of delivering better performance in general. If successful Nvidia could make AMD GPUs irrelevant until the company finally made Radeon GPUs with built-in ray tracing.

RTX 20-series was a bit of a flop. When the RTX 2080 and 2080 Ti launched in late 2018 there weren’t even any games that supported ray tracing or deep learning super sampling (DLSS). But Nvidia priced RTX 20-series cards as if those features made all the difference. At $699 the 2080 had a nonsensical price and the 2080 Ti’s $1199 price tag was even more insane. Nvidia wasn’t even competing with itself anymore.

The performance improvement in existing titles was extremely disappointing too; the RTX 2080 was only 11% faster than the GTX 1080 though at least the RTX 2080 Ti was around 30% faster than the GTX 1080 Ti.

The next two years were a course correction for Nvidia. The threat from AMD was starting to become pretty serious; the company had finally regained the process advantage by moving to TSMC’s 7nm and the company launched the RX 5700 XT in mid-2019. Nvidia was able to head it off once again by launching new GPUs this time the RTX 20 Super series with a focus on value but the 5700 XT must have worried Nvidia. The RTX 2080 Ti was three times as large yet was only 50% faster meaning AMD was achieving much higher performance per millimeter. If AMD made a larger GPU it could be difficult to beat.

Both Nvidia and AMD planned for a big showdown in 2020. Nvidia recognized AMD’s potential and pulled out all the stops: the new 8nm process from Samsung the new Ampere architecture and an emphasis on big GPUs. AMD meanwhile stayed on TSMC’s 7nm process but introduced the new RDNA 2 architecture and would also be launching a big GPU its first since RX Vega in 2017. The last time both companies launched brand-new flagships within the same year was 2013 nearly a decade ago. Though the pandemic threatened to ruin the plans of both companies neither company was willing to delay the next generation and launched as planned.

Nvidia fired first with the RTX 30-series led by the flagship RTX 3090 but most of the focus was on the RTX 3080 since at $699 it was far more affordable than the $1499 3090. Instead of being a repeat of the RTX 20-series the 3080 delivered a sizeable 30% bump in performance at 4K over the RTX 2080 Ti though the power consumption was a little high. At lower resolutions the performance gain of the 3080 was somewhat less but since the 3080 was very capable at 4K it was easy to overlook this. The 3080 also benefitted from a wider variety of games supporting ray tracing and DLSS giving value to having an Nvidia GPU with those features.

Of course this wouldn’t matter if the 3080 and the rest of the RTX 30-series couldn’t stand up to AMD’s new RX 6000 series which launched two months later. At $649 the RX 6800 XT was AMD’s answer to the RTX 3080. With nearly identical performance in most games and at most resolutions the battle between the 3080 and the 6800 XT was reminiscent of the GTX 680 and the HD 7970. Each company had its advantages and disadvantages with AMD leading in power efficiency and performance while Nvidia had better performance in ray tracing and support for other features like A.I. upscaling.

The excitement over a new episode in the GPU war quickly died out though because it quickly came apparent that nobody could buy RTX 30 or RX 6000 or even any GPUs at all. The pandemic had seriously reduced supply while crypto increased demand and scalpers snatched up as many GPUs as they could. At the time of writing the shortage has mostly ended but most Nvidia GPUs are still selling for usually $100 or more over MSRP. Thankfully higher-end GPUs like the RTX 3080 can be found closer to MSRP than lower-end 30 series cards which keeps the 3080 a viable option.

On the whole the RTX 3080 was a much-needed correction from Nvidia. Although the 3080 has marked the end of Nvidia’s near total domination of the desktop GPU market it’s hard not to give the company credit for not losing to AMD. After all the RX 6000 series is on a much better process and AMD has been extremely aggressive these past few years. And besides it’s good to finally see a close race between Nvidia and AMD where both sides are trying really hard to win.

So what’s next?

Unlike AMD Nvidia always keeps its cards close to its chest and rarely ever reveals information on upcoming products. We can be pretty confident the upcoming RTX 40 series will launch sometime this year but everything else is uncertain. One of the more interesting rumors is that Nvidia will utilize TSMC’s 5nm for RTX 40 GPUs and if this is true then that means Nvidia will have parity with AMD once again.

But I think that as long as RTX 40 isn’t another RTX 20 and provides more low-end and mid-range options than RTX 30 Nvidia should have a good enough product next generation. I would really like for it to be so good that it makes the list of best Nvidia GPUs of all time but we’ll have to wait and see.

The redesigned chassis is now slimmer and offers better aesthetics than previous generation Titans. Though primarily made of plastic the Titan GT77 still manages to feel premium and well-built.

Connectivity features are on par for the course for a 2022 flagship laptop. The 720p webcam is unbefitting for the asking price. The Cherry MX mechanical keyboard and the roomy touchpad are welcome additions in the Titan GT77.

The FHD panel in our unit which is currently not available in retail was average at best with mediocre brightness distribution and contrast ratio. However it offers a 360 Hz refresh rate and low response times that should please competitive gamers. For all other purposes we recommend opting for SKUs with a UHD panel.

The Core i9-12900HX and the 175 W RTX 3080 Ti Laptop GPU combination offers oodles of processing power for just about any workload you throw at it as long as you don't mind the high heat and noise emissions.

There aren't too many Alder Lake-HX laptops in the wild at the moment. But if you have deep pockets and need absolutely unhindered top-of-the-line performance with looks to match there are very few gaming laptops that can hold a candle to the MSI Titan GT77.

The Titan GT77 is not without some glaring shortcomings though. MSI has some work cut out on the storage subsystem front — the SD card reader can surely use a speed bump and the NVMe drives definitely merit a capable thermal solution. Wi-Fi 6E performance also needs to be looked into. MSI's software suite needs some bug fixing as well particularly MSI True Color. MSI's OverDrive functionality can also use some tweaking to ensure a more equitable power share between the CPU and GPU for consistent clocks and power draws.

Should you go out and get the Titan GT77 right away? This is a moot question if you are prepared to shell out five grand. However the Titan GT77 has some able competition that can save you quite some dough. The Raider GE67 HX 12UGS with the Core i9-12800HX and RTX 3070 Ti for example often comes quite close to the top-spec Titan GT77 for half the price (US$2500).

If a 360 Hz display is what you are after the Alienware x17 R2 offers comparable performance although it features the Core i9-12900HK for US$3900. The Aorus 17X XES does lag behind the Titan GT77 in overall CPU and GPU performance but its US$2999 price does merit a consideration. If features such as the mechanical keyboard and a plethora of NVMe slots are more important you can still get the Titan GT77 with a Core i7-12800HX and an RTX 3070 Ti for close to US$3100.

AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT: Two minute review

AMD should have led with the AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT.

After a year and a half since AMD launched this generation's RDNA 2 graphics cards and almost two years after Nvidia launched its first consumer Ampere cards AMD has come out with a card that epitomizes everything AMD is known and respected for. It's just a shame that it's last call on this generation of graphics cards and the RX 6950 XT likely won't get the love it really deserved.

The RX 6950 XT is the first graphics card from Team Red to pose an actually serious challenge to the Nvidia RTX 3090's gaming performance and even though some inconsistencies inevitably hold it back from going a full twelve rounds against Nvidia's best it's the kind of fighter that you find yourself cheering for anyway.

What is so appealing about the AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT is that it is simply one of the best graphics cards – if not the best – in the premium tier when measuring its price to its performance. AMD has always been known for offering great cards at a great price and what's amazing about the RX 6950 XT is that AMD manages to bring that same philosophy into the premium tier of the graphics card market.

Cards at this level are all about performance and they normally have prices to match but the RX 6950 XT shows that even the most exclusive clubs can have an item or two on the value menu.

As such it is a great option for gamers out there who can afford a premium card but aren't actually giant human-shaped walking piles of money – it least it would be if RDNA 3 wasn't right around the corner. AMD's next-gen graphics cards are likely to make some major advances in terms of ray tracing and hardware-assisted upscaling tech that should blow the current generation of AMD cards out of the water so buying anything premium from this generation right now is iffy at best.

It's entirely possible that an AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT could have comparable performance to the RX 6950 XT and it will likely be cheaper so the potential value of this card is somewhat wasted with so late an entry into the market. Again it's a shame because this card has a lot going for it at least on the gaming front.

If you're not a gamer though there really isn't a whole lot for you here. While the RX 6950 XT is the best AMD graphics card to hit the market its creative workload performance still lags considerably behind the best Nvidia GeForce graphics cards and without Tensor cores the RX 6950 XT simply isn't up for the task of intense machine learning models and other similar research work that makes Nvidia RTX cards so prized.

All that said this was always meant to be a gamer's graphics card and for the price you're paying the AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT might be that rare premium PC component that manages to deliver outstanding value in a market where such an idea is almost entirely alien. But if you can wait until RDNA 3 launches it might be worth seeing what AMD's next-gen cards offer before plopping down a lot of money on a card that could be quickly overshadowed before the year is out.

It is available now Where can you get it? You can buy in the US UK and Australia

The AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT we reviewed is the Gigabyte RX 6950 XT Gaming OC version rather than an AMD reference card so it's a bit more expensive than AMD's $1099 (about £880 AU$1580) MSRP.

The Gigabyte RX 6950 XT Gaming OC card retails for $1299 (about £1039 / AU$1870) which is still $200 (about £160 / AU$290) cheaper than Nvidia's RTX 3090 Founders Edition card and $300 (about £240 / AU$430) cheaper than the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 3090 Gaming OC card.

AMD's MSRP for the RX 6950 XT is also $100 (about £80 / AU$145) less than the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti even though the 3080 Ti is a much more comparable card to the RX 6950 XT by the numbers in most cases.

It's also worth noting that AMD cards are generally not as heavily bought for mining or by profiteers on resale sites so they've generally seen better availability than RTX 30-series cards and so might be easier to find in most cases.

AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT: Design and chipset

(Image credit: Future)

On-board Dual BIOS switch for OC and Silent modes

16.7 million RGB color options for Gigabyte logo on card

Faster GPU and memory clocks

The Gigabyte RX 6950 XT Gaming OC card we reviewed is a pretty good looking card that you won't be embarassed to show off in your build and it sure as hell looks more attractive than the AMD reference card design for the RDNA 2 cards.

Sporting a silver and dark gray colorway the Gigabyte card features a three-alternating-fan cooling solution where the middle fan spins counterwise to the two fans on either side of it. This is designed to make for less turbulent air flow through the card to help keep things cool and it does appear to take 5°C to 10°C off the max temperature in our tests compared to the RTX 3090 Ti and RTX 3080. But that isn't so much of a difference that other conditions might have played a larger role than a counterclockwise spinning fan blade. If nothing else it looks cool if you stop to notice it at any point.

Gigabyte AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT Gaming OC key specs GPU: Navi21

Stream Processors: 5120

Ray Accelerators: 80

Power Draw (TGP): 335W

Base Clock: 1925 MHz

Boost Clock: 2324 MHz

VRAM: 16GB GDDR6

Memory Speed: 1800MHz

Memory Bus: 256-bit

Memory Bandwith: 576.0 GB/s

Card Interface: PCIe 4.0

Outputs: 2 x HDMI 2.1 2 x DisplayPort 1.4a

Power Connector: 3 x 8-pin

Recommended PSU: 850W

Chances are you won't really see it though but that's ok because Gigabyte's Aorus Fusion 2.0 will let you program 16.7 million different color options into the Gigabyte logo along the visible edge including several different patterns like color wave color pulse and more that adds some additional RGB flair to your build.

There is also a attractive looking backplate to the card that doesn't just protect the sensitive connections on the PCB but the brushed metal design has an almost space-station-y feel to it that is an excellent complement to a Gigabyte Aorus motherboard.

Along the edge of that backplate you'll also find a dual BIOS switch that can flip the card from OC to Silent mode with the former pushing performance while the latter is designed for quieter operation.

Finally this card needs a lot of power but it blessedly doesn't come with Nvidia's funky new connectors that require an adapter to convert from your standard 8-pin to a 12-pin one. The RX 6950 XT will still require three available 8-pin connectors though.

On the inside the Gigabyte RX 6950 XT is powered by the same Navi21 GPU found in the Radeon RX 6900 XT though with some faster clock speeds for both the GPU and the 16GB of GDDR6 memory.

The RX 6900 XT for example features a base clock of 1825 MHz and a boost of 2250 MHz compared to the RX 6950 XT's 1925 MHz and 2324 MHz respectively which is a bit over 3% to 5% faster.

In terms of memory the VRAM on the RX 6950 XT is also a bit faster at 2250MHz compared to the RX 6900 XT's 2000MHz. With the amount of VRAM and the same 256-bit memory bus this extra speed might not seem like a lot but it does mean that the card has almost 13% more memory bandwidth than the RX 6900 XT 576GB/s to 512GB/s respectively.

The RX 6950 XT has the same number of stream processors as the RX 6900 XT (5120) as well as the same number of Ray Accelerators (80). With its faster clocks and an additional 35W of TGP as the RX 6900 XT (325W to 300W respectively) the RX 6950 XT is simply able to do more with the hardware it has.

AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT: Performance

(Image credit: Future)

Excellent RTX 3090-level performance (most of the time)

Creative workloads falter

The AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT is unquestionably the best video card AMD has ever put out and while it's not exactly the equal of the RTX 3090 (or the RTX 3080 Ti in some cases) it's still more than enough performance to play the best PC games on ultra settings with some ray tracing and get playable and even enjoyable 4K gaming with the help of AMD FSR.

Test system specs This is the system we used to test the AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT: CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D

CPU Cooler: Corsair iCue H150i Elite Capellix 360mm AIO

RAM: Corsair Vengeance LED DDR4-3200

Motherboard: Gigabyte Aorus Master X570 (BIOS F36c)

SSD: Samsung 980 Pro 1TB NVMe M.2 SSD

Power Supply: Corsair AX1000

Case: Praxis Wetbench

FSR support is still rolling out so you may still need to make adjustments to your settings to hit the top of the parabolic curve where graphics quality and 60 fps line up.

But that's the case even with the RTX 3090 Ti with DLSS on which only just barely hits 60 fps (ocassionally) in Cyberpunk 2077's benchmark at 4K with the Ultra Ray Tracing graphics preset. And even then that's its max frame rate its average is in the high 40s while without any upscaling the RTX 3090 Ti only hits 24 fps on those settings.

The RX 6950 XT meanwhile only maxes out in the high 30s with FSR on though it's average is about 29 fps. Without any upscaling support the RX 6950 XT creaks in with 13 fps on these settings.

In nearly all of our benchmarks the RX 6950 XT falls short of the RTX 3090 and Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and even the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 depending on the test. But where the RX 6950 XT falters it's not completely bowled over and its greatest weakness is when ray tracing is being pushed to the max.

Nvidia cards are simply better at ray tracing since their ray tracing cores are just a more mature graphics architecture at this stage than AMD's first generation Ray Accelerators introduced with AMD RDNA 2. The RX 6950 XT's rasterization performance is still just as good or better than the RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3090's with the latest AMD card beating even the RTX 3090 Ti in 3DMark's Fire Strike Ultra.

So while the Nvidia RTX cards are definitely the reigning champs at ray tracing in many cases you simply won't be using ray tracing since even on the top-tier Nvidia GPUs you're still looking at a 4K slideshow without upscaling tech like DLSS and FSR and not every game has implemented those technologies yet. In the case of most games you will be playing for the next couple of years you're much more likely to need to lean on rasterization performance as you always have.

Ray tracing and upscaling tech just isn't fully here yet for it to be a blowout and once you've enjoyed the show with ray tracing for a bit and you actually want to do some 4K gaming at 60fps the RX 6950 XT becomes a lot more competitive especially if you're willing to tweak some settings where appropriate though not on every game out there.

The most important thing to say about the RX 6950 XT though is that for a lot of people the idea of owning an RTX 3090 or RTX 3090 Ti is a pipe dream at their MSRP – even if it weren't for the silicon shortage dastardly eBay and StockX profiteers and the crypto bubble of 2020 - 2022 mucking things up even further.

At $1099 the RX 6950 XT is roughly 27% cheaper than the RTX 3090 Founders Edition and it's nearly half the price of the RTX 3090 Ti. It's even cheaper than the RTX 3080 Ti and its gaming performance is very competitive against these top three RTX cards when you consider how much performance you get for every dollar spent on the card.

And we do want to stress that this is a gamer's graphics card without a doubt. It does better than every other AMD card on our creative benchmarks but it still way behind where even the RTX 3060 Ti is across Blender's three benchmark tests.

In fact the RX 6950 XT only starts to beat out Nvidia cards in Blender starting at the RTX 3060 and even then it's just barely in only one of the three tests. Similarly it's Adobe Premiere performance lags about 50 points behind the RTX 3060 and the RTX 3060 is about a third of the price of the RX 6950 XT. If you're a creative you have a lot better options out there that will offer you a much better value for the workflows that you need.

All that said while we can't say it's the best graphics card out there the AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT is pretty damned great if you're looking for a gaming graphics card especially since it can give you a taste of really premium graphics if you're priced out of the RTX 3090 and RTX 3090 Ti. As this generation of graphics cards winds down ahead of Nvidia Lovelace and AMD RDNA 3 the AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT is a great card to close it out with. And who knows? You might even be able to find this one in stock someday.

Should I buy an AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT?

(Image credit: Future)

Buy it if…

You want fantastic non-ray-traced performance

While its ray tracing performance lags premium RTX cards the RX 6950 XT can go toe to toe on rasterzation any day.

You want an ""affordable"" premium graphics card

For a card with this kind of performance the RX 6950 XT is an excellent value that competes with cards nearly twice its MSRP.

You don't want to wait for RDNA 3

As possibly the last of the major AMD RDNA 2 releases the RX 6950 XT is an impressive coda on this generation for Team Red.

Don’t buy it if…

You can wait another several months

If you're not in an absolute rush to buy a new graphics card AMD RDNA 3 cards are expected to land later this year and they might have a lot more to offer than you'll get with the RX 6950 XT.

You're on a tight budget

The RX 6950 XT is a great value for a card in its class but it's still a very premium card in terms of its price.

You need it for something other than gaming

If you're a creative or you're doing research with machine learning you're going to find the performance here seriously lacking especially for the price.

Also consider

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090

As far as premium cards go the RTX 3090 strikes a great balance between price and performance while having more features like tensor cores and more mature ray tracing cores than those in the RX 6950 XT. Just be willing to hand over an eye-watering sum of money for one. Read the full Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 review

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti

While only a bit more expensive than the RX 6950 XT the RTX 3080 Ti has a lot of great features that the RX 6950 XT lacks like tensor cores better ray tracing and better creative workload performance. Read the full Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti review

AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT

The RX 6800 XT might not be nearly as powerful as the RX 6950 XT but its performance-to-price ratio is phenomenal. As a 1440p graphics card this is a fantastic option if you don't need 4K gaming capability and you want to save yourself some real money. Read the full AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT review

First reviewed in June 2022",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVsdHJhYm9va3Jldmlldy5jb20vNTc2MTctbGVub3ZvLWxlZ2lvbi1zbGltLTdpLXJldmlldy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lenovo Legion Slim 7i review (Slim 7i 16IAH7 model),"This is our detailed review of the Lenovo Legion Slim 7i the more compact and more portable all-purpose laptop in the Lenovo Legion family.

I’ve used this laptop for the last few weeks and gathered my thoughts and impressions down below.

Unlike the 2021 Legion Slim 7 reviewed here in the past the 2022 generation is a completely new design both on the outside and on the inside. A new chassis a 16-inch display higher power hardware improved cooling and a 99Wh battery are among the main selling points of this series now.

Lenovo backs this up with competitive pricing at least in today’s reality where everything has gotten more expensive. However that might vary between regions especially as configurations also vary between countries.

My review unit is a balanced middle-grounder with a 12th-gen Intel Core i7 processor RTX 3060 graphics and a 1600p IPS display but this exact combo isn’t available everywhere. Regardless we’ll touch on the other screen/spec options in this article so you’ll know what to expect if you decide on getting one of these over any of the other thin-and-light laptops in this niche.

Specs as reviewed– 2022 Lenovo Legion Slim 7i

As per Lenovo’s specs sheets this should be available in multiple other variants going up to Core i9-12900HK RTX 3070 100W and miniLED display configurations. However at the time of this article only the lower-tier 3050Ti and 3060 models are available in most regions.

AMD-based Legion Slim 7 models are also scheduled for a later date. A comparison between the current AMD Ryen 9 and Intel Core i9 platforms is available here.

Update: A 2023 update of the Lenovo Legion Slim 7 series is also available in the meantime.

Design and construction

This year the Legion 7 and Legion Slim 7 share the same design language with the latter being slightly thinner and lighter. Of course they’re also different on the inside but that’s not a topic for this article.

That means the Slim 7 is now a darker-grey design with machined milled metal edges – in fact they sell this in two grey versions and this variant here is the lighter Storm Grey model. There’s also an Onyx Grey model which is an almost black kind of grey like the previous generation of the Slim 7.

I was afraid those edges might dent and scratch but I’m not seeing any mark-ups on my unit after using it for these past weeks not even around the left area near my watch buckle. In comparison the bare-aluminum finishing on my old XPS 13 shows a low of scufss around that area but the materials on the Legion seem to be tougher.

In fact the entire construction feels robust and sturdy and it’s one of my favorite things about this design. The lid is strong the hinges feel strong and smooth when adjusting the screen angle and there are no flex or squeaky noises in the main chassis. This Legion Slim 7i feels about the same build quality as a MacBook these days. I didn’t have a MacBook Pro 16 for comparison but I did stanch a few pics of this Slim 7 next to my MBP 13 just for fun.

At the same time while thinner and lighter than the other Legion laptops this Slim 7 is not as compact or as lightweight as other options available in the space today. It weighs 2.2 kilos (4.8 lbs) in the tested version and it’s a deeper design with a hump behind the screen. It’s still portable for what it is but I must note that alternatives like a ROG Zephyrus M16 Flow X16 or especially a Blade 15 are smaller and lighter. I’ll have a follow-up post comparing these in the near future.

Now this laptop feels compact in daily use and that’s because the screen is positioned closer to the user and not all the way to the end of the chassis. Lenovo also implemented narrow edges around the panel with a small chin and a forehead at the top required to house the camera and act as a lever that allows you to easily grab and pick up the display when opening this up.

This Legion Slim 7i is also a friendly and ergonomic design. I already mentioned the sturdy build quality and the solid hinges which keep the display in place without it wobbling. I’ll add up that Lenovo did a fair job at dulling the front edges and corners so they don’t bite into the wrists as well as implemented a display that leans back flat to 180 degrees.

I also appreciate the dark-grey color scheme which does an excellent job at hiding smudges and fingerprints while still looking sleek. I’ve been using this for weeks and didn’t even have to wipe it clean for the photo shoot for this article. In contrast the underbelly is black and it shows smudges much easier – that’s normal for black metals. Furthermore if you opt for the Onyx Grey color version of the laptop that’s also almost the same kind of black as the piece used for the D-panel on this sample and will show smudges.

I’m still not a fan of the always-lit power button which lights up in different colors based on the power profile in use. That’s because it’s placed just under the screen and in the line of sight so can be slightly annoying when using the laptop at night. I don’t find much use for knowing the active profile in this way but at least Lenovo redesigned it and made the lit edging narrower than on the previous generations so I can live with it.

While in here you’ll notice there’s this array of dots flanking the power button at the top of the keyboard. Those are for ventilation purposes allowing extra fresh air to go into the thermal module and don’t hide any up-firing speakers. The speakers are still on the bottom just like on all the other Legion laptops.

Speaking of the bottom flipping the laptop upside down you’ll also notice the large and grippy rubber feet as well as the open ventilation over the thermal module. We’ll further discuss this in the cooling section down below.

As far as the IO goes Lenovo didn’t cut any corners on this laptop despite its slimmer profile. The ports are spread around the edges and the back and include USB-A HDMI 2.1 USB-C ports a card-reader audio-jack e camera eShutter. The only things missing are a K-Lock and a standard LAN port.

The HDMI port on the back hooks into the dGPU. As for the two USB-C ports one supports Thunderbolt 4 with DP via the Intel iGPU and the other supports video straight from the Nvidia dGPU. Both support USB-C charging at up to 135 W of power.

All in all this is the best IO you will find on a portable performance laptop these days. Some other laptops offer all the same ports such as the Gigabyte Aeros or the Acer Predator Triton 500 but the Slim 7i steps up with the excellent arrangement around the sides and on the back allowing for a less-cluttered experience when connecting peripherals.

Keyboard and trackpad

The keyboard on this Slim 7i hasn’t changed much from the previous Legion 7 models.

The layout is still among the best you’ll find in a portable laptop these days as long as you’re OK with this sort of design with a NumPad section and not a simpler centered design. The main set of keys are full-size the arrows are also all full-size keys and spaced out from everything around and the NumPad section includes narrower keys.

The keycaps are plastic and color-matched to the dark-gray color of the chassis. That means they won’t smudge as easily as black keys but at the same time they don’t feel quite as nice to the touch as the rubbery keycaps implemented by other brands. I’m definitely nitpicking here but it is what it is.

The feedback on this keyboard is also shallower than on what other OEMs put in their gaming laptops with actuations that require a softer stroke and shorter key travel at 1.3 mm. Being used to shallower keyboards myself I was able to get along fine with this one but the typing experience is a bit unforgiving to straying hands and might not be ideal for everyone. In fact I feel that this keyboard comes close to what Lenovo put on their IdeaPad and Yoga ultraportables. I do appreciate how quietly this types.

For the lighting my sample gets white-only LEDs but a variant with per-key RGB lighting is also available – that’s the same keyboard from the 2021 Legion 7 series.

The LEDs on this sample are bright and uniform but at the same time plenty of light bleeds out from under the keycaps with this design and some of the light shines off the display’s chin and the Legion logo there. You’ll only notice this if you’re using the laptop at night in total darkness.

As a side note I still wish Lenovo would allow the lighting to automatically switch off after 30 seconds. There’s no such time-out option at least none that I could find so I had to always disable the lighting manually by hitting FN + Space (which cycles between the intensities and eventually switches the LEDs off).

The clickpad on this laptop is an averagely-sized glass surface with Precision drivers. It’s not as spacious as other implementations and smaller than what you’re getting with the Legion 7 models but it feels smooth to the touch and works just fine with everything you will throw at it. The surface doesn’t rattle with firmer taps either and the physical clicks feel fine just a bit clunky.

Now due to how this clickpad is centered under the Space key and towards the left side of the chassis accidental palm swipes tend to happen time and again. Palm rejection is overall fairly good but this aspect is still something worth considering especially by those of you with larger hands. The whole thing has been already documented on the existing Legion 7 and Legion 5 Pro laptops so you’ll be able to find more about it online. Derek mentioned it during his time with his 2021 Legion 5 Pro laptop and explained here how you can address them if needed.

As for biometrics there’s a finger-sensor in the power button but no IR camera.

Screen

There’s a 16-inch 16:10 display in the 2022 Legion Slim 7 series an upgrade from the 15-inch 16:9 panel used in the previous generation. This aligns the Slim 7 to the Legion 5 Pro and Legion 7 lineups both available with 16-inch displays.

Lenovo mention three panel options for the Slim 7 models:

FHD+ 1920 x 1200 px IPS with 350-nits of brightness and 100% sRGB colors 165Hz 7ms;

QHD+ 2560 x 1600 px IPS with 500-nits of brightness and 100% sRGB colors 165Hz 3ms and GSync support;

QHD+ 2560 x 1600 px IPS miniLED with 1250-nits of brightness and 100% DCI-P3/Adobe RGB colors 165Hz 3ms.

Our unit is the middle-ground QHD+ IPS panel very similar to what Lenovo has been offering on the Legion 7 and Legion 5 Pro models in the last year. It’s not wide-gamut but otherwise it’s an excellent multi-purpose display for everyday use and gaming. It also allows for GSync support either on the Hybrid – Advanced Optimus mode or on the dGPU MUX mode.

Here’s what we got in our tests with an X-Rite i1 Display Pro sensor:

Panel HardwareID: MGN007DA1-G;

Coverage: 97.0% sRGB 71.9% DCI-P3 73.8% AdobeRGB;

Measured gamma: 2.19;

Max brightness in the middle of the screen: 494.92 cd/m2 on power;

Min brightness in the middle of the screen: 4.32 cd/m2 on power;

Contrast at max brightness: 1159:1;

White point: 6000 K;

Black on max brightness: 0.42 cd/m2;

PWM: No;

Response: ~7.5ms GtG (source).

Our sample came out somewhat poorly calibrated out of the box with a slightly skewed White point. Everything looks fine after calibration.

Now as far as the color gamut goes sure this panel is not as color-rich as the 100% DCI-P3 500-nits panels offered by competing models and I would have preferred having the option for one of those instead. Still the fact that it can be pushed up in brightness compensates for this to some extent to the point where this doesn’t actually feel like a regular 100% sRGB panel but as a nicer and more poping display.

The FHD+ panel option offered for this series is only 350-nits and still 100% sRGB but feels duller and more muted in comparison. That’s still a decent panel for everyday use but if given the choice I’d definitely pay extra for this QHD+ option.

As for the mini LED panel that’s not yet available in stores and I’d reckon it will only be paired with the higher-specced configurations. 16-inch miniLED panels are awesome based on our experience with them on devices such as the ROG Flow X16 or the Zephyrus DUO 16 but they’re not necessarily ideal for every situation due to the blooming and uniformity artifacts associated with multi-zone lighting. Hence I’d advise further research if you plan on getting the mini LED panel on this series especially at the added associated cost.

Hardware and performance

Our test model is a mid-specced configuration of the 2022 Lenovo Legion Slim 7i built on an Intel Core i7-12700H processor 16 GB of DDR5-4800 memory in dual channel 1 TB of fast SSD storage and dual graphics: the Nvidia RTX 3060 dGPU with 6 GB of vRAM and the Iris Xe iGPU integrated within the Intel processor.

Disclaimer: This is a retail unit provided for this review by Lenovo and it runs on the software available as of mid-August 2022 (BIOS JYCN39WW Vantage 3.13.14.0 GeForce 516.59 drivers). Some aspects might change with later updates.

Spec-wise this 2022 Legion Slim 7i is built on the latest Intel and Nvidia hardware available to date. The Core i7-12700H is the mainstream performance option in Intel’s Alder Lake 12th-gen platform with 14 Cores and 20 Threads. It is a hybrid design with 6 High-Performance and dual-threaded Cores and 8 extra Efficiency cores which work together in the various loads. The design and thermal module of this Legion allow the processor to run at up to 80W of sustained power in demanding CPU loads.

For the GPU the 2022 Legion Slim 7i series is available with RTX 3000 graphics chips. What we have on this sample is the mid-tier RTX 3060 running at up to 100W with Dynamic Boost. 3050Ti 95W and 3070 100W configurations are also available but no 3070Ti.

A MUX is still offered here with several modes including dGPU-only or Advanced Optimus (several Hybrid modes). Switching to dGPU requires a restart.

For the RAM this series comes with 8 GB of soldered RAM and one accessible DIMM that can take an either 8 or 16 GB stick. Our unit is a 16 GB of DDR5-4800 RAM configuration. For storage there are two M.2 2280 PCIe gen4 slots on this series and this sample comes preconfigured with a newer-gen and fairly fast SK Hynix drive.

Getting to the components requires you to remove a few Philips screws all visible around the back and then pull up the D-panel. You’ll need a plastic pin and some sort of suction cup to take out the bottom panel as it is very snugly attached to the main chassis – getting inside this laptop is more difficult than it should be. Inside the RAM is covered by a metal shield and the SSDs are easily accessible. Thermal pads are placed over the SSDs to allow the heat to spread onto the back metal underbelly.

For the software this unit came with Windows 11 preinstalled and the standard set of Lenovo apps – you’ll want to uninstall some of them. I like the predefined wallpaper it looks so much nicer than what most OEMs offer these days.

The power profiles are Quiet Balance and Performance and you can select them from Vantage or switch between them with Fn+Q. These profiles apply different power settings to the CPU/GPU and different fan profiles as well as switch the color of the LED in the power button. Here’s a table that shows what each mode does:

Quiet (blue) Balance (white) Performance (red) TDP PL1/PL2 TGP TDP PL1/PL2 TGP TDP PL1/PL2 TGP 25/45W ~35W 40W/80W ~85**W 90W/135W* ~100W

*The PL settings for the Performance mode are not a proper indicator of the real-life performance because the CPU is thermally throttled around 75-80W in sustained loads as you’ll see in a bit.

** By default Balance mode sets an 85W TGP for the dGPU. However enabling the Legion Ai Engine option in Vantage allows the GPU to run at up to 100W in this mode as well but with the same kind of noise levels as in Performance mode.

That aside I’ll also mention that this series lacks the option to overclock the GPU in the BIOS/Vantage an option available on other Legion devices. Hence the GPU runs at stock clocks on all modes.

Before we jump to the performance section here’s how this laptop handles everyday use and multitasking on the Quiet/Balanced profiles unplugged from the wall.

Performance and benchmarks

On to more demanding loads we start by testing the CPU’s performance by running the Cinebench R15 test for 15+ times in a loop with a 1-2 seconds delay between each run.

The Core i7-12700H processor stabilizes at 75-78W of sustained power on the Performance setting with the laptop sitting on the desk. As mentioned earlier Lenovo applies 90W PL2 and 135W PL1 power limits for this processor on this power mode but the CPU is thermally throttled in this sort of load.

Bumping the back of the laptop off the desk in order to improve the airflow into the fans allows the processor to stabilize at a minimally higher sustained power of 80+W with similar 48-49 dB noise levels and a minimal increase in the Cinebench scores.

Switching over to the Balanced profile translates into the CPU stabilizing at ~40W with quieter fans and cooler temperatures. The Cinebench performance takes a 25% hit over the previous mode.

On the Quiet profile the CPU runs at only 25W with sub 30 dB noise levels and temperatures in the 50s C.

Finally the CPU runs at ~25 W on battery as well on the Performance profile. That’s an aggressive limitation in comparison to other 12th-gen Intel laptops including the Lenovo Legion 5i Pro reviewed here. Details below.

Overall these profiles could be further tweaked. The laptop is thermally limited on Performance mode and then aggressively power capped on the other modes so there’s no proper middle-ground profile for those interested in running sustained CPU loads. You’ll most likely go with Performance mode for any serious work but you’ll have to accept the very high CPU temperatures which isn’t ideal.

To put these findings in perspective here’s how this Core i7-12700H implementation fares against other mid-tier laptops in this test both Intel and AMD.

The i7 runs at about 80-85% of its capabilities in this design so not as fast as on higher-power implementations. It is a competitive performer though sitting in between other portable designs both Intel or AMD.

We then went ahead and further verified our findings with the more taxing Cinebench R23 loop test and Blender – Classroom which resulted in similar findings to what we explained above.

We also ran the 3DMark CPU test on the Performance and Balanced profiles.

Finally we ran our combined CPU+GPU stress tests on this notebook. 3DMark stress runs the same test for 20 times in a loop and looks for performance variation and degradation over time and this unit passed it just fine which means there’s no performance throttling with longer-duration sustained loads.

Next we ran the entire suite of tests and benchmarks on the Performance profile in Vantage the MUX set on Hybrid mode and on FHD+ screen resolution for consistency with our other tests. Here’s what we got:

On the CPU side this Intel-based Slim 7i is a fair performer. Just like in the Cinebench loop tests it’s not as fast as higher-power and better-cooled implementations in the longer sustained loads but it’s snappy in the shorter runs. Among the portable designs something like the Zephyrus M16 with its higher-power thermal design allows for up to 10% higher sustained performance in the multi-threaded CPU loads. At the same time the Slim 7 is slightly faster than the Razer Blade 15 or the Predator Triton 500 and superior to AMD-based devices such as the ROG Flow X16.

On the GPU side this is a 100W implementation while most other premium thin-and-light designs run at 120-125W with Dynamic Boost. The Blade 15 is the only other option that we’ve tested that runs at similar power and that’s a more compact product and the TUF Dash F15 runs at 100W as well but that’s a more affordable model. Hence other high-tier portable options are going to perform about 7-15% faster in GPU-heavy loads. It’s not a significant difference but something some of you might want to consider in your decision.

As a whole though the Slim 7 is a competitive performer and definitely a step-up from the previous Slim 7 2021 generation. The culprits are the high CPU thermals in sustained loads corroborated with a slightly lower CPU/GPU power design in compared to some of the current alternatives. The differences are within 5-15% and even less with daily use so not necessarily significant.

With that out of the way some of you might not appreciate the loudly spinning fans on the Performance mode which ramp up to 48-49 dB at head level. Thus if you prefer sacrificing the performance to some extent for quieter fan noise here’s how this Legion Slim 7i does on the Balance profile with the Legion AI option disabled in Vantage which limits the fans at sub 42 dB at head level.

3DMark 13 – Fire Strike: 16994 (Graphics – 18341 Physics – 27217 Combined – 8040);

16994 (Graphics – 18341 Physics – 27217 Combined – 8040); 3DMark 13 – Time Spy: 7536 (Graphics – 7072 CPU – 12009);

7536 (Graphics – 7072 CPU – 12009); Uniengine Superposition – 1080p Extreme: 4619;

4619; GeekBench 5.4.3 64-bit: Single-Core: 1764 Multi-core: 11673;

30.92 s; Blender 3.01 – Classroom scene – CPU Compute: 7m 08s (Balanced).

The CPU performance is hardly impacted on the shorter activities but the 40W PL limit eventually kicks in with demanding loads. The GPU runs at 85W in this mode which results in a 10-15% performance hit from the Performance mode. Thus for general everyday use this Balanced profile makes a lot of sense.

If we’re to tick the Legion AI option in Vantage that would push the GPU to 100W even on this Balance mode and also push the fans to around 48 dB noise levels. Hence this mode would defeat the purpose of lowering the fan noise.

There’s also the Silent mode to consider here which keeps the fans at sub 35 dB in sustained loads but this significantly limits both the CPU and GPU so I wouldn’t recommend that for anything intensive.

Gaming performance

Let’s look at some games now.

We tested a couple of different types of games on the Performance and Balanced profiles at QHD+ and FHD+ resolutions all with the MUX set on the discrete GPU mode.

The gaming performance is fine here within 8-15% lower than on high-power Intel 12th-gen + RTX 3060 implementations such as the Legion 5i Pro within 5-10% of the AMD + RTX 3060 125W ROG Flow X16 and on par with other 100W implementations such as the TUF Dash F15.

With that out of the way let’s go over some performance and temperature logs.

The Performance mode ramps up the fans to levels of 48-49 dB with the laptop sitting on the desk. That keeps the CPU at around 77-80 degrees Celsius between the tested titles while the GPU runs at between 80-82 degrees. These are fair results and show that Lenovo couldn’t have pushed for a higher power GPU in this design without affecting temperatures.

Bumping the back of the laptop off the desk in order to improve the airflow into the fans leads to a noticeable decrease in CPU/GPU temperatures with the CPU now running in the high-60s C and the GPU at around 73-75 C. These are excellent temperatures and you should consider bumping up the laptop or placing it on a cooling pad for long gaming sessions. It’s not required though as the temperatures and performance of a flat surface are already OK here.

There’s also the option to switch over to the Balance mode. With Legion Ai Engine disabled the fans slow to about 42 dB at head-level and the framerates takes a 10-15% toll from the Performance mode as the GPU power is limited at around 85W. The temperatures are still fine in the high 70s on the CPU and low 80s on the GPU just a little higher than on Performance mode.

With Legion Ai enabled the laptop performs just as on Performance mode with similar fan settings and the GPU being pushed to 100W. Hence the Balance mode makes the most sense with Legion Ai Engine disabled as a way of lowering fan noise while still not greatly limiting the performance.

As for the Quiet mode it keeps the fans at sub 35 dB levels but is hardly usable here as it greatly limits the GPU to around 35W of power. That means you’ll have to trim down to FHD+ with medium graphics settings to get around 60 fps in recent titles.

The laptop’s performance on battery power is somewhat similar to the Quiet mode explained above but the GPU runs at 45W in this case both on the Performance or the Balanced modes. Hence FHD+ with medium settings should be doable in most games. Don’t expect more than 1 hour and 30 minutes of gameplay.

Noise Heat Connectivity speakers and others

This Legion Slim 7i gets a standard but efficient thermal module similar to the cooling modules implemented in other Legion laptops.

It includes two fans four radiators and three heatsinks that spread over the components. Unlike in other Legions there are no thermal radiators over the SSDs here instead thermal pads connect the drives to the metal back.

This cooling module works well here with the exception of sustained CPU loads where the CPU ends up thermally limited on the Performance mode. It is nonetheless a miniaturized design in comparison to the larger Legion models hence it can only handle a 100W GPU and the lower-limited CPU.

Most of the fresh air comes inside the laptop through the open intakes on the underbelly and only some through the grills at the top around the power button. As a result these intakes are choked-up by the small-profile implemented rubber feet when the laptop sits on a desk.

That’s why lifting up the back of the laptop in order to improve the airflow into the fans leads to a significant decrease in internal temperatures. However unlike on the other high-power Legions this Slim 7 actually runs within acceptable temperatures on the desk as well. Thus bumping it up only allows for a more comfortable user experience and lower internal temperatures in the 60s and 70s.

One other aspect to mention here is that dust easily goes inside this laptop due to its open-back design and unlike other brands Lenovo are not isolating the thermal module from the rest of the motherboard with foam so the dust freely goes all over the place. Hence I’d recommend opening up this laptop from time to time in order to clean it properly and prevent the dust from clogging in.

As far as the fan noise goes we’re looking at 48 dB at head-level on the Performance mode 42 dB on Balance mode (without Legion Ai Engine) and sub 35 dB on Quiet mode all with demanding activities. With lighter use you’ll hardly hear the fans on Balance or Quiet especially as the fans can also idle with low-intensity tasks.

As far as temperatures go no complaints with daily use. The hottest spot reaches temperatures in the mid-30s and it’s around the power button so out of touch.

*Daily Use – streaming Netflix in EDGE for 30 minutes Quiet profile fans idle or sub 30 dB

With games and with the laptop on a flat surface the hotspot moves in the center and at the top of the keyboard. It reaches temperatures in the mid-4os on Balanced mode and high-40s on Performance and somewhat higher on the back.

In both cases the fact that the hotspot is positioned so low on the chassis means that this Legion Slim 7i is going to feel somewhat uncomfortable for long gaming sessions.

Hence you’ll want to bump up the back of this laptop or place it on some sort of cooling pad to lower the internal and thus the external temperatures. There’s still a hotspot around the Space key in this case but the overall chassis temperatures drop in comparison to using the laptop on a flat surface.

*Gaming – Performance – playing Cyberpunk for 30 minutes fans at ~48 dB

*Gaming – Balance– playing Cyberpunk for 30 minutes fans at ~42 dB



For connectivity there’s Wireless 6E and Bluetooth 5 through an Intel-based Killer 1675i chip on this laptop. It proved fast and reliable during my time with the laptop.

Audio is handled by two speakers placed on the bottom of the chassis. Due to how they’re placed on the flat underbelly you’ll need to be careful not to cover and muffle them when not using the laptop on a desk.

These get fairly loud at close to 80 dB max levels but the audio quality still isn’t much lacking in the lows and slightly distorting and high volumes. That’s pretty much the case with the entire Legion lineup and this Slim 7i is no different.

Finally I’ll mention the camera placed at the top of the screen and flanked by microphones. The ensemble does what it’s supposed to and the camera is FHD resolution and a wide angle so a little better than what you’re normally getting on laptops these days. I also appreciate the electronic shutter offered on the right side of the laptop which lets you electronically kill both the camera and the microphones when you don’t need them.

Battery life

There’s a 99Wh battery inside the Legion Slim 7i configuration which is the largest possible in a laptop and larger than most other portable designs offer.

The system still doesn’t automatically switch the screen’s refresh from 165 Hz to 60 Hz when you unplug the laptop as other devices do but I could cycle between the 60 and 165 Hz modes by hitting Fn+R.

It’s also important to set the laptop on Hybrid-Auto or Hybrid-iGPU only modes in vantage in order to disable the dGPU with battery use.

So here’s what we got on our unit with the screen’s brightness set at around 120 nits (~60 brightness) and either 60 or 165 Hz refresh.

– 165Hz 4K Netflix fullscreen in Edge Quiet Mode screen at 60% Wi-Fi ON; 8 W (~12 h of use) – 60Hz 4K Netflix fullscreen in Edge Quiet Mode screen at 60% Wi-Fi ON;

– 60Hz 4K Netflix fullscreen in Edge Quiet Mode screen at 60% Wi-Fi ON; 18 W (~5-6 h of use) – 165Hz browsing in Edge Balance Mode screen at 60% Wi-Fi ON;

– 165Hz browsing in Edge Balance Mode screen at 60% Wi-Fi ON; 62 W (~1.5 h of use) – 165Hz gaming – Witcher 3 Balance Mode screen at 60% Wi-Fi ON.

These are good runtimes for an Intel 12th-gen laptop and overall this Slim 7i is more efficient than the majority of other Alder Lake Core H laptops we’ve tested this year.

I’ll also add that Lenovo pairs this configuration with a mid-sized 230W power brick a dual-piece design with long cables and a total weight of just under 1 kilo. You can also charge the laptop via USB-C at up to 135W in case you don’t want to bring along the main charger just be aware that it’s not going to run at full capabilities on USB-C power.

Price and availability- Legion Slim 7i

The Legion Slim 7i is available in some areas of the world at the time of this article.

The Intel i7 + RTX 3060 configuration is listed in Lenovo’s US store at $1549 (discounted for $1899 MSRP) but that’s for the lesser FHD 350-nits display option. A 3050Ti configuration with the QHD+ display is also available for under $1800 but the other models are not yet listed in North America.

Over here in Europe the series is available with the QHD+ display for around 2000 EUR for the i7 + RTX 3060 model or 1600 EUR for the i5 + RTX 3050Ti variant. If possible I’d recommend going with the QHD+ screen option over the basic FHD+.

Follow this link for updated configurations and prices in your region at the time you’re reading this article.

The AMD-based 2022 Legion Slim 7 models are not yet available in stores but should be in the near future. I expect those to sell for less than these Intel configurations.

Final thoughts- 2022 Lenovo Legion Slim 7i

I enjoyed my time with this laptop and I think it’s a fair all-arounder for those of you looking for an all-purpose premium-feeling notebook at a competitive price.

The excellent build quality the IO and ergonomics and the 16-inch screen options are the main selling points of this series corroborated with the balanced capabilities and long battery life.

At the same time this is not as powerful as the other Legion laptops out there and in fact not as powerful as many of the other thin-and-light designs in the same class. Furthermore given the noisy fans and high chassis temperatures on the Performance mode I’d recommend using this laptop on the mid-level Balance profile which does a better job juggling with the performance thermals and noise levels.

Alternatives such as the full-size Lenovo Legion 7 offer superior performance and cooling while other portable designs such as the ROG Flow X16 or the ROG Zephyrus M16 offer better screens better performance and better cooling in smaller/lighter designs. The Slim 7i has the pricing on its side though at least when available on sale so as long as you’re OK with its capabilities and limitations and you can find this for a good price I’d expect you to be happy with what you’ll be getting.

This wraps out my time with this 2022 Lenovo Legion Slim 7i series but I’d love to hear your thoughts on the series and feedback on my review so get in touch in the comments section down below.

From the 90 brilliant-cut diamonds totaling 115 carats set in a necklace for Princess Fawzia of Egypt in the late 1930s to the 34.64-carat pink “Princie” diamond (said to have once been owned by the ruling nizams of Hyderabad) acquired by the house in 1960 the company’s history is full of headline-grabbing jewels. Now meet the newest: a mammoth 910-carat Type IIA D-Color white diamond rough from South Africa’s Letšeng mine dubbed the Lesotho Legend which served as the building block for the Parisian jeweler’s latest high-jewelry collection.

Purchased in 2018 for $40 million through diamond dealer Jean-Jacques Taché the Legend is the fifth-largest gem-quality diamond ever mined. The resulting finished stones range in size from 25.06 to 79.35 carats; in total 67 diamonds came from the original rough. In Chapter I (of II) of the Legends of Diamonds collection 25 jewelry pieces are created from the most important stones surrounded by rubies sapphires and emeralds the colors of which amplify the significance of the flawless and internally flawless white diamonds. The undeniable star is the Chevron Mystérieux necklace (pictured above) adorned with three massive pear-cut white diamonds—measuring 31.24 carats 12.18 carats and 12.07 carats—dangling beneath an array of intense green emeralds and deep-blue sapphires.

Each piece is arranged in a Mystery Set technique patented by the house in 1933 in which stones are set without the use of prongs or other visible metal components; the designs are so challenging that an entire workshop was dedicated to their production. “That’s why we’ve never seen something of this nature before” says Nicolas Bos president and CEO of Van Cleef & Arpels. “It means that for two years we’ve had to put on hold almost every other project in Mystery Setting to really concentrate on this collection. For us it’s quite historical because it’s a huge commitment—a type of exercise we’ve never done before.”

Real estate investment trusts – or REITs for short – can be fantastic securities for generating meaningful portfolio income. REITs widely offer higher dividend yields than the average stock.

While the S&P 500 Index on average yields less than 1.5% right now it is relatively easy to find REITs with dividend yields of 5% or higher.

The following downloadable REIT list contains a comprehensive list of U.S. Real Estate Investment Trusts along with metrics that matter including:

How To Use The REIT List To Find Dividend Stock Ideas

REITs give investors the ability to experience the economic benefits associated with real estate ownership without the hassle of being a landlord in the traditional sense.

Because of the monthly rental cashflows generated by REITs these securities are well-suited to investors that aim to generate income from their investment portfolios. Accordingly dividend yield will be the primary metric of interest for many REIT investors.

For those unfamiliar with Microsoft Excel the following images show how to filter for REITs with dividend yields between 5% and 7% using the ‘filter’ function of Excel.

Click here to download your Complete REIT Excel Spreadsheet List now. Keep reading this article to learn more.

Step 1: Download the Complete REIT Excel Spreadsheet List at the link above.

Step 2: Click on the filter icon at the top of the ‘Dividend Yield’ column in the Complete REIT Excel Spreadsheet List.

Step 3: Use the filter functions ‘Greater Than or Equal To’ and ‘Less Than or Equal To’ along with the numbers 0.05 ad 0.07 to display REITs with dividend yields between 5% and 7%.

This will help to eliminate any REITs with exceptionally high (and perhaps unsustainable) dividend yields.

Also click on ‘Descending’ at the top of the filter window to list the REITs with the highest dividend yields at the top of the spreadsheet.

Now that you have the tools to identify high-quality REITs the next section will show some of the benefits of owning this asset class in a diversified investment portfolio.

Why Invest in REITs?

REITs are by design a fantastic asset class for investors looking to generate income.

Thus one of the primary benefits of investing in these securities is their high dividend yields.

The currently high dividend yields of REITs is not an isolated occurrence. In fact this asset class has traded at a higher dividend yield than the S&P 500 for decades.

Related: Dividend investing versus real estate investing.

The high dividend yields of REITs are due to the regulatory implications of doing business as a real estate investment trust.

In exchange for listing as a REIT these trusts must pay out at least 90% of their net income as dividend payments to their unitholders (REITs trade as units not shares).

Sometimes you will see a payout ratio of less than 90% for a REIT and that is likely because they are using funds from operations not net income in the denominator for REIT payout ratios (more on that later).

REIT Financial Metrics

REITs run unique business models. More than the vast majority of other business types they are primarily involved in the ownership of long-lived assets.

From an accounting perspective this means that REITs incur significantnon-cash depreciation and amortization expenses.

How does this affect the bottom line of REITs?

Depreciation and amortization expenses reduce a company’s net income which means that sometimes a REIT’s dividend will be higher than its net income even though its dividends are safe based on cash flow.

Related: How To Value REITs

To give a better sense of financial performance and dividend safety REITs eventually developed the financial metric funds from operations or FFO.

Just like earnings FFO can be reported on a per-unit basis giving FFO/unit – the rough equivalent of earnings-per-share for a REIT.

FFO is determined by taking net income and adding back various non-cash charges that are seen to artificially impair a REIT’s perceived ability to pay its dividend.

For an example of how FFO is calculated consider the following net income-to-FFO reconciliation from Realty Income (O) one of the largest and most popular REIT securities.

Source: Realty Income Annual Report

In 2021 net income was $359 million while FFO available to stockholders was above $1.4 billion a sizable difference between the two metrics. This shows the profound effect that depreciation and amortization can have on the GAAP financial performance of real estate investment trusts.



The Top 7 REITs Today

Below we have ranked our top 7 REITs today based on expected total returns.

Expected total returns are in turn made up from dividend yield expected growth on a per unit basis and valuation multiple changes. Expected total return investing takes into account income (dividend yield) growth andvalue.

Note: The REITs below have not been vetted for safety. These are high expected total return securities but they may come with elevated risks.

We encourage investors to fully consider the risk/reward profile of these investments.

Top REIT #7: Chimera Inv. Corp. (CIM)

Expected Total Return: 16.7%

16.7% Dividend Yield: 14.1%

Chimera Investment Corporation is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that is a specialty finance company. The company’s primary business is in investing through subsidiaries in a diversified portfolio of mortgage assets including residential mortgage loans Non-Agency RMBS Agency CMBS and other real estate related securities.

Chimera’s income is predominantly obtained by the difference between the income the company earns on its assets and financing and hedging costs. The company funds the purchase of assets through several funding sources: asset securitization repurchase agreements (repo) warehouse lines and equity capital.

Chimera has exhibited a markedly volatile performance record over the last decade. Since 2012 it has grown its earnings-per-share at a 1.2% average annual rate but it has seen its earnings decline in the last five years. Moreover the REIT has been caught off-guard with a high debt load in the downturn caused by the latest surge in inflation.

Top REIT #6: AGNC Investment Corporation (AGNC)

Expected Total Return: 16.8%

16.8% Dividend Yield: 11.6%

American Capital Agency Corp was founded in 2008 and is a mortgage real estate investment trust that invests primarily in agency mortgage-backedsecurities (or MBS) on a leveraged basis.

The firm’s asset portfolio is comprised of residential mortgage pass-throughsecurities collateralized mortgage obligations (or CMO) and non-agencyMBS. Many of these are guaranteed by government sponsored enterprises.

The majority of American Capital’s investments are fixed rate agency MBS. Most of these are MBS with a 30-year maturity period. AGNC derives nearly all its revenue in the form of interest income. It currently generates $1.2 billion in annual net revenue.

You can see an overview of the company’s second-quarter report in the image below:

Source: Investor Presentation

AGNC reported its Q2 2022 results on July 25 2022. Q2 net spread and dollar roll income per share stood at 83 cents up from 72 cents sequentially. Tangible net book value stood at $11.43 as of June 30 2022. Economic return on tangible common equity stood at -10.1% compared to -14.4% sequentially. AGNC also reported a net loss per common share of $(0.87). The company’s investment portfolio as of June 30 2022 stood at $61.3 billion.

Furthermore the trust at an average repurchase price of $10.78 per share repurchased 4.7 million common shares. Meanwhile cash and unencumbered agency MBS amounted approximately $2.8 billion at quarter end.

We expect 16.8% annual returns for AGNC made up of the 11.6% dividend yield negative growth of -0.9% and a ~6.1% boost from a rising P/FFO multiple.

Top REIT #5: The Macerich Company (MAC)

Expected Total Return: 16.8%

16.8% Dividend Yield: 5.7%

Macerich Company is one of the country’s leading owners operators and developers of major retail real estate. The

company owns 51 million square feet of real estate consisting primarily of interests in 47 regional shopping centers.

The company has a significant presence in the West Coast Arizona Chicago and the Metro New York to Washington DC corridor.

Source: Investor Presentation

Thanks to the recovery of the economy from the pandemic and pent-up consumer demand business momentum has improved in recent months with the tenants of the REIT currently enjoying higher sales than pre-pandemic levels. Macerich expects FFO per share of $1.90-$2.04 this year.

Macerich has properties in densely populated areas with high barriers to entry. However its poor performance record does not indicate the existence of a meaningful competitive advantage.

Moreover Macerich has a high debt load as its interest expense currently exceeds its operating income and its net debt stands at $4.8 billion which is 185% its current market cap. The high debt load is a major concern particularly given the secular decline of this business.

Top REIT #4: Medical Properties Trust (MPW)

Expected Total Return: 17.6%

17.6% Dividend Yield: 7.2%

Medical Properties Trust is the only pure-play hospital REIT today. It owns a well-diversified portfolio of over 400 properties which are leased to over 30 different operators. The great majority of the assets are general acute care hospitals but show some diversification into other specialty hospitals including inpatient rehabilitation and long-term acute care.

The portfolio of assets is also well diversified across different geographies with properties in 29 states to mitigate the risk of demand and supply imbalances in individual markets. On top of its US portfolio Medical Properties maintains a strategic exposure to key European markets including Germany the UK Italy and Australia.

Medical Properties’ FFO/share growth has been strong over the past decade as it has gone from $0.72 in 2011 to $1.75 in 2021. Looking ahead the trust expects its aggressive acquisition pipeline to combine with its defensive net-leases to drive growth.

We expect annual returns of 17.6% per year driven by 5.3% AFFO-per-share growth the 7.2% dividend yield and a 5.1% annual boost from an expanding P/FFO multiple.

Top REIT #3: Douglas Emmett (DEI)

Expected Total Return: 19.1%

19.1% Dividend Yield: 5.2%

Douglas Emmett is the largest office landlord in Los Angeles and Honolulu with a 38% average market share of office space in its sub-markets. The REIT generates 86% of its revenue from its office portfolio and 14% of its revenue from its multifamily portfolio. It has approximately 2700 office leases in its portfolio annual revenue of $1 billion and a market capitalization of $4.5 billion.

Source: Investor Presentation

The merits of being the largest office landlord in Los Angeles are obvious as Los Angeles County is the third-largest city in the world with GDP of $1 trillion behind only Tokyo and New York. The dominant position of Douglas Emmett creates operational synergies. In addition the REIT benefits from high barriers to entry which reduce competition. Moreover the proximity to premier housing attracts affluent tenants who offer reliable cash flows to the company.

The markets of Douglas Emmett are characterized by high rent growth and relatively low volatility. Rents in the West Los Angeles submarkets of the REIT have grown 150% over the last 25 years at a 3.7% average annual rate the highest growth rate among all the U.S. gateway markets.

Douglas Emmett certainly benefits from this trend as its leases include 3%-5% annual rent hikes. Thanks to this tailwind the company has grown its adjusted FFO per share at a 3.5% average annual rate over the last decade.

Top REIT #2: Brandywine Real Estate (BDN)

Expected Total Return: 20.7%

20.7% Dividend Yield: 9.0%

Brandywine Realty Trust owns develops leases and manages an urban town center and transit-oriented portfolio which includes 168 properties in Philadelphia Austin and Washington D.C. The REIT generates 74% of its operating income in Philadelphia 22% of its operating income in Austin and the remaining 4% in Washington D.C.

As Brandywine Realty Trust generates the vast portion of its operating income in Philadelphia and Austin it is worth noting the advantages of these two areas. According to official reports Philadelphia has the highest growth rate of highly educated citizens since 2008 while Austin is the fastest-growing metropolitan area the best place to start business and it has retrieved all the jobs lost due to the pandemic.

Brandywine Realty Trust is offering an above-average 9.0% dividend yield. Given the solid payout ratio of 54% the dividend looks enticing on the surface. However it is important to note that the REIT operates with a nosebleed leverage ratio (Net Debt to EBITDA) of 7.0. It also has a heavy schedule of debt maturities until the end of 2024. As a result the dividend is likely to come under pressure in the event of an unforeseen downturn.

The high debt load is probably the primary reason behind the freeze of the dividend for 14 consecutive quarters. Moreover Brandywine Realty Trust is sensitive to recessions due to its weak balance sheet and the sensitivity of its tenants to recessions.

Still we expect annual returns above 20% driven by the 9% dividend yield expected FFO-per-share growth of 3% and a sizable boost from an expanding valuation multiple.

Top REIT #1: SL Green Realty (SLG)

Expected Total Return: 21.4%

21.4% Dividend Yield: 7.9%

SL Green Realty Corp was formed in 1980. It is an integrated real estate investment trust (REIT) that is focused on acquiring managing and maximizing the value of Manhattan commercial properties. It is Manhattan’s largest office landlord and currently owns 73 buildings totaling 35 million square feet.

It is Manhattan’s largest office landlord and currently owns 73 buildings totaling 35 million square feet.

Source: Investor Presentation

In mid-July SLG reported (7/20/2022) financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Its occupancy rate slipped from 92.7% at the end of the previous quarter to 92.0% but its same-store net operating income grew 6.7% over the prior year’s quarter.

Given also a benefit of $0.14 per share from assets purchases and sales its funds from operations (FFO) per share grew 17% over the prior year’s quarter from $1.60 to $1.87. The REIT exceeded the analysts’ consensus by $0.17. During the quarter SLG signed 39 Manhattan office leases for a total of 188822 square feet.

We expect annual returns of 21.4% going forward comprised of 5% expected earnings growth the 7.9% dividend yield and a ~8.5% annual boost from an expanding P/FFO multiple.

Final Thoughts

The REIT Spreadsheet list in this article contains a list of publicly-traded Real Estate Investment Trusts.

However this database is certainly not the only place to find high-quality dividend stocks trading at fair or better prices.

In fact one of the best methods to find high-quality dividend stocks is looking for stocks with long histories of steadily rising dividend payments. Companies that have increased their payouts through many market cycles are highly likely to continue doing so for a long time to come.

You can see more high-quality dividend stocks in the following Sure Dividend databases each based on long streaks of steadily rising dividend payments:

Alternatively another great place to look for high-quality business is inside the portfolios of highly successful investors. By analyzing the portfolios of legendary investors running multi-billion dollar investment portfolios we are able to indirectly benefit from their million-dollar research budgets and personal investing expertise.

To that end Sure Dividend has created the following two articles:

Published 7:30 am Saturday August 20 2022

1 of 2

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

Are you a City of Washington resident who recycles garbage items? If not what are barriers that keep you from doing it?

One of the barriers to recycling can be a lack of knowledge about what can be recycled and what can not. What can be recycled are plastics metal and paper. Examples of plastics are water soda juice milk and detergent bottles. These bottles must be emptied out and have no pumps. All metal cans can be recycled but they need to be emptied out as well. Newspaper (without inserts or flyers) can be recycled in addition to office paper notebooks envelopes and flattened cardboard. Glass can be recycled in the City of Washington’s community glass recycling convenience center located at 250 Plymouth Street. The center only accepts brown clear and green glass bottles and jars. They will neither accept bags nor aluminum.

Any item(s) not listed above must go in green trash carts.

Recycling sounds like a great way to have a lasting positive impact on the environment from the comfort of your home but is it effective?

A 2019 study from the U.S. PIRG Education Fund and the Environment North Carolina Research and Policy Center shows that in fiscal year 2016-2017 North Carolina landfilled more than 9.7 million tons of waste and recovered 1.7 million tons for a low recovery rate of almost 15%. This is due to international waste trade restrictions municipalities across the state reducing the number of recyclable materials they will accept – including some glass and plastics.

“In FY 2016-2017 North Carolina generated 5.5 pounds of trash per resident each day a full 2 pounds less than in FY 2005-2006. However most of that waste reduction occurred between 2008 and 2010 – waste generation then increased during FY 2015-2016. This could potentially be connected to the number of local government waste reduction and reuse programs falling from 108 in 2015 to 93 in 2017” the report states.

Following the trend in 2020 Beaufort County commissioners voted 6-1 to end its recycling services per an earlier article from The Daily News. This means they would no longer accept paper plastic and metal items. The vote was made to end the service because service provider – Republic Services – notified the county that the cost of recycling would increase from $66 per metric ton to $110 per metric ton. The annual cost would have risen from $15180 to $25300 for recycling an average of 230 tons of material the Daily News reported.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cm9uZXdzLmNvbS9uZXh0LzIwMjIvMDgvMjAvY3plY2gtZmlybS13YW50cy10by11c2UtM2QtcHJpbnRpbmctdG8taGVscC1yZWJ1aWxkLXVrcmFpbmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Could 3D printing technology help rebuild Ukraine's damaged towns and cities?,"By Euronews

The Icon of the Seas is scheduled to go into service as the first ship in this series in the fall. Not much is known about the ship but RCI is already promising “the best family vacation in the world”.

Royal Caribbean International is launching a major marketing campaign for Icon of the Seas with a video series entitled making an Icon and Episode 1 Envisioning an Iconic Vacation.

RCI's CEO Michael Bayley describes the ship in the first video episode as ""the best thing Royal Caribbean has built in the last 50 years"". Jay Schneider Chief Product Innovation Officer speaks of the ""best family vacation in the world"". The video uses terms like “jaw-droppingly amazing” “groundbreaking unparalleled” or “transformational vacation experience”. The Icon of the Seas will revolutionize the world of cruising.

However the first video episode does not yet contain specific details about the new icon class but it does contain interesting insights into the planning process for a new ship class and some pictures of the construction of the Icon of the Seas in Turku Finland.

If you take a closer look at the video you can at least see some details that have already been discussed by observers in recent months:

""Pearl"": A spherical structure with an alleged diameter of around 15 meters is said to bear the name ""Pearl"". It is not yet known what lies behind this mysterious construction. It is clear that the pearl was delivered to the shipyard in one piece and positioned approximately in the middle of the ship.

""Aqua Dome"": The name ""Aqua Dome"" has been publicly mentioned by Royal Caribbean before but again it is unclear what exactly is behind it. Thought to be located above the bridge so similar to the solarium on the Oasis and Quantum class ships it could be a novel water theme park especially as RCI announces great water activities for the Icon of the Seas.

Vertical stem: More and more new cruise ships now have a vertical stem and one can be seen in the video. So the bow shape of the Icon of the Seas will probably follow this trend.

What is officially known so far is that the Icon of the Seas will be powered by liquid gas (LNG) and that advanced environmental technology will be used. According to details from the shipping company's financial report there should be room for around 5600 passengers on the Icon of the Seas.

The Icon of the Seas will probably debut in Great Britain but will then have Miami as its base port for the 2023/24-winter season.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiogFodHRwczovL3d3dy52b2ljZS1vbmxpbmUuY28udWsvbmV3cy91ay1uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDgvMjEvZXhjbHVzaXZlLWxlYWRpbmctYmxhY2stdG9yaWVzLXRvLWxhdW5jaC1ncm91cC1haW1lZC1hdC13aWRlbmluZy1wYXJ0eXMtYXBwZWFsLXRvLWFmcmljYW4tY2FyaWJiZWFuLXZvdGVycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EXCL: Black Tories to launch group to appeal to African Caribbean voters,"BLACK TORIES are joining forces to launch a new organisation aimed at improving the relationship between the Conservative Party and the black community.

The 2022 Group which will launch in October consists of MPs councillors and activists who want to see the party better engage with black voters.

The idea for the group came after former Number 10 special advisor Samuel Kasumu discussed the idea with fellow party members Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones the agricultural entrepreneur widely known as The Black Farmer and Police & Crime Commissioner Festus Akinbusoye during a series of dinners at the Royal Automobile Club (RAC) in Pall Mall which began last September.

Among the 2022 Group’s key areas of focus will be increasing the overall numbers of Black Conservatives in national and local government and holding public appointments. It also aims to influence party policy on domestic and international issues.

David Cameron led efforts to make the Conservative Party more diverse when he became party leader in 2005

Other policy areas include supporting an increase in trade with Commonwealth countries.

After he became party leader in 2005 former prime minister David Cameron launched the ‘A-List’ a list drawn up by Conservative Central Office of 100 preferred prospective parliamentary candidates aimed at widening the party’s appeal to a diverse electorate.

Political observers have claimed that the legacy of that move produced seemed to fulfil Cameron’s bold 2015 pledge that the first Black or Asian prime minister would come from the Conservative Party.

The current party leadership race saw candidates such as Nadhim Zahawi Rishi Sunak Kemi Badenoch and Suella Braverman standing in its early stages producing a diverse contest not matched by any political party in Europe.

You need competition because it breeds innovation. It means better policies and better ideas that appeal to different people. Samuel Kasumu former No 10 special adviser

No political party in a major western democracy has ever produced a leadership field with anything like the levels of ethnic diversity in the Conservative contest of 2022.

But despite this progress Kasumu told The Voice that the party still struggles to win over black voters.

“When you look at the Conservative party you’ll find that if you are from an African Caribbean background you’re very likely to be able to progress as much as your gifts and talents take you” he said.

“You can be someone like Kemi Badenoch become a Cabinet minister and do very well in the party leadership race. Or you could be someone like me who joined the party as a 19-year-old and became the most senior black advisor in government.

Challenge

“So the challenge is not what happens once you become a member. The challenge is that a lot of Black people who might have similar values on issues such as education family and enterprise and who might see themselves as conservative often feel like they cannot or will not join the party. We want to try and find a way to deal with this and enable them to see that the Conservative Party is open to them.”

Kasumu’s resignation as No 10 special adviser prompted wide speculation about why he left. But Kasumu told The Voice there was no rift with Boris Johnson

He continued: “It doesn’t mean you’re going to agree with everything that everybody says in the party. We are a broad church. Within the party you have radical Brexiteers you have One Nation Conservatives you have those on the more liberal wing. This is what we’re really trying to present to the community as well as highlight the fact that there are plenty of opportunities for people to go as far as their gifts and talents can take them.”

Among some of the leading Black Conservatives who have attended the group’s meeting ahead of its October launch are education secretary and former party chairman James Cleverley Hitchin Harpenden MP Bim Afolami Maidstone and The Weald MP Helen Grant and former London Mayoral election candidate Shaun Bailey.

Loyal

Kasumu acknowledges that Black voters have traditionally been loyal to the Labour Party but says that politics as a whole and not just the Conservative Party can benefit from a shift in allegiance.

“If a community of people feel like they can only ever vote for one party that party may end up taking their votes for granted. Also the opposition party the opposition party may feel this community’s votes are not worth fighting for. But you need competition because it breeds innovation. It means better policies and better ideas that appeal to different people.”

The launch of the 2022 Group follows Kasumu’s decision to resign as No 10’s special adviser for civil society and communities in April last year.

Departure

At the time it was widely speculated that his departure was linked to the widely criticised report from the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities which controversially denied the existence of structural and institutional racism.

However it is a claim that Kasumu is keen to downplay.

“What I will say and this is not necessarily a popular thing to say is that the Prime Minister Boris Johnson was always very encouraging to me to go for the things I was passionate about. I never had any issue. Beyond that as a special advisor your job is to advise and it’s for ministers to decide. And if people don’t necessarily agree with some of the advice you have a choice about how to respond.”

As well as preparing plans for the launch of the 2022 Group Kasumu is focusing on his next move in politics as a candidate in the London Mayoral elections of 2024.

“I’m certainly an outsider” he said. “Although I’m a local councillor I’m not a former MP or secretary of state. I’m an outsider in London because I’m a Black Tory. So therefore the way I run my campaign will have to be untraditional. I’ll have to just do my way.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNyaWNrZXRlci5jb20vVG9waWNzL3N0LWx1Y2lhLWtpbmdzL2NhcmliYmVhbl9wcmVtaWVyX2xlYWd1ZV8yMDIyX2FsbF95b3VfbmVlZF90b19rbm93Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Caribbean Premier League 2022: All you need to know,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.thecricketer.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /Topics/st-lucia-kings/caribbean_premier_league_2022_all_you_need_to_know.html (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159B9546B90>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNyaWNrZXRlci5jb20vVG9waWNzL3N0LWx1Y2lhLWtpbmdzL2NhcmliYmVhbl9wcmVtaWVyX2xlYWd1ZV8yMDIyX2FsbF95b3VfbmVlZF90b19rbm93Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,

I want to be very clear here I am NOT advocating for driving over the speed limit. (65 all the way baby.) What I am saying is hypothetically if you are inclined to drive fast a good choice of vehicle would be something powerful yet subtle. Something practical but also well built and low key that does not immediately draw the attention of law enforcement. And also something fully electric because nothing makes you more incognito on the road than silence.

The Acura ZDX is that very something that ticks all of these boxes.

The first full electric from Acura the ZDX is a midsize crossover SUV that doesn’t immediately clock as a midsize crossover SUV. The lines are all low slung and the back end has a pleasing boxiness. The car is mostly blacked out from the beltline up giving the roof a floating appearance. It’s a bit luxe but equally understated.

MullenLowe The Acura ZDX.

It’s stylish but also practical. At its very practical heart the ZDX is built on GM’s Ultium platform a modular electric propulsion system that can be tweaked to fit a bunch of different vehicles from light trucks to cars to SUVs like the ZDX. Acura partnered with GM in the hopes it could fast track a fully electric entry without developing one from the ground up internally. You know what? It works. The battery tech feels mature with the ZDX getting around 300 miles of range per charge.

If there is one stat on the ZDX that is actually eye-catching it would have to be the 499 horsepower and and 544 lb-ft of torque of the Type S variants. The car also weighs in at over six thousand pounds yet it still rips—0-60mph is reached in 4.2 seconds. Things feel solid and predictable even after the speedometer starts creeping into the low triple digits – not that I would ever go that fast officer. Keep in mind this isn’t some autobahn thrashing import that you can comfortably take to a buck fifty without so much as a window rattle. The ZDX glides quickly and effortlessly from point to point but if you’re looking for something that can chew asphalt and rip through tight corners then you might have to switch to something fossil fuel powered like BMW’s X4 M or the unhinged Dodge Durango Hellcat.

Like virtually all electric vehicles the ZDX features regen braking which you can adjust through driving modes or on the steering wheel paddle. On the strongest setting the regen brakes are grabby enough to use one pedal driving. There are also standard brakes too – 15.3 inch front brake rotors! – but if you’re in regen braking mode they’ll hardly ever be used.

MullenLowe The illuminated front end of the ZDX.

The interior is spacious—far more than it looks on the outside—particularly in the cargo area which has a 28.7 cubic foot capacity. A number of car companies—looking at you BMW and Mercedes—have copied Tesla’s homework and eliminated virtually all physical buttons from their electric offerings. Look we’re assaulted by screens all day long and it’s nice to get into a ride and have the tactile pleasure of flicking an actual switch. The ZDX’s array of physical buttons knobs and switches for controlling everything from the entertainment to driving options to adaptive cruise control are a delight. The Type S variant also has Hands Free Cruise Acura's version of GM's Super Cruise hands-free driving tech which you can’t imagine living without if your commute has any semblance of traffic.

MullenLowe The Acura ZDX.

The ZDX occupies an interesting space. It’s a good—maybe great—alternative to the Tesla Model Y Mercedes EQB and BMW iX. It’s also quicker than most crossover electrics and somewhat stealthy—the CHP will definitely pull over the guy in the Ferrari Purosangue before he pulls over you in the ZDX. If you still find yourself itching for bigger thrills in an Acura maybe the best move would be to get something a little more fiery like one of their fun-as-hell Integra reissues. But if you’re looking for a reliable electric ride for people and cargo that delivers a good dosage of zoom the ZDX Type S is a very good bet.

""What a s--- show of a job you have!"" comedian Josh Ocean Thomas said in response.

Thomas a San Diego native who moved to the Midwest to pursue comedy shared a clip of the exchange during his recent set at The Laugh Factory in Chicago on Instagram earlier this week where it has gone viral.

""You work for the Biden administration? Is your job to wake him up or what’s your job?"" Ocean asked ""Nick"" as the audience erupted into laughter.

BIDEN VOWS TO WITHHOLD WEAPONS FROM ISRAEL IF NETANYAHU GOES FORWARD WITH RAFAH INVASION

Miming a fictional Biden staffer trying to get the president’s attention he exclaimed ""Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! There’s a war! Hey!""

The bit continued with Thomas asking Nick what he really does for Biden. Before he could respond the comic remarked ""What a s--- show of a job you have. I can’t believe you admitted that in front of all these people.""

""You have the freedom to lie. You could have said you were a hooker and I would’ve been prouder of you"" he added.

The alleged Biden staffer started to tell Thomas that he travels to southern states before the comic interrupted with a burst of laughter.

""That’s crazy! You go to the south and try to sell ‘em on Biden? You’re f----- r------! What the f---? What are you talking about?"" he said. ""That’s your f----- job? Is to go ‘Hey listen I know you guys like Trump but Biden. I mean…’""

The clip ended with one last joke as Thomas asked ""Wow. Are you ready to be unemployed? Or what’s your vibe?""

Thomas captioned the video writing ""This was my only option.""

Thomas wasn't the only comic to take aim at Biden this week.

Anti-Trump comedian Michael Rapaport torched the president in a video he shared to X on Thursday in which he officially declared he would not be supporting Biden’s re-election after the world leader told CNN he would not send weapons to Israel if it invades Rafah Hamas' last stronghold in Gaza.

Kennedy Jr.’s running mate complained on Thursday that she was “slandered” and had to “take a walk to shake it off.”

Shanahan who has been bankrolling RFK Jr.’s spoiler-ready campaign for president with the fortune she got in her divorce from Google founder Sergey Brin did not raise any specific objection to the story which she said she didn’t read until nearly a full day after it was published.

But she did go into detail about an almost cinematic encounter she had on her walk when she “pulled into a farmers market to say hello to the farmers.”

“I walked by a young man on the empty side of the parking lot who recognized me and said ‘Nicole Shanahan!’ and said he was a supporter of Bobby and watched my speech” she wrote on X.

“He said he studied the psychology of politics in college. I told him about the article and how I was trying to walk it off. He told me he had watched the ‘Who is Bobby Kennedy’ film which is specifically about how cruel and embarrassingly desperate the left-wing media can be.”

“He’s 23 years old. I looked up at the sky and then said to this young man ‘thank you you are just what I needed in this moment to keep going strong.’ His name is Alex. Thank you Alex.”

The Daily Beast reached out to the Kennedy campaign after her post but did not get an immediate response. The Daily Beast could not reach Alex because no last name was provided but he can contact us at tips@thedailybeast.com at any time.

The story that Shanahan appeared to be referring to detailed her meteoric rise from a turbulent childhood in Oakland California to the wife—and then ex-wife—of one of the richest men in the country as well as the running mate of a conspiracy theory-driven third-party presidential candidate who could hand the election to Donald Trump.

The Beast story the result of more than a dozen interviews and several weeks of work was highlighted by top tech journalist Kara Swisher on Threads on Thursday. In particular Swisher noted that a source who has spent significant time with Shanahan scoffed at Kennedy’s description of her as an artificial intelligence expert with the source saying that she “couldn’t differentiate ‘AI from a tennis ball.’”

Swisher then went on to add “And more: Unsuccessful entrepreneur losing lawyer bloviating nonsense on all manner of things she has no expertise in marriage incompetence and she’s just plainly a candidate for a thirsty wack job because she managed to get a pile of money from a tech billionaire who wanted her to go away.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvdXMvcG9saXRpY3MvcmZrLWpyLWphY2stc2NobG9zc2JlcmcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Using Cartoonish Accents J.F.K.'s Grandson Insults and Mocks Robert F.

In a series of Instagram posts the grandson Jack Schlossberg 31 variously called Mr. Kennedy 70 a “prick” suggested he was using steroids said he was “lying to us” and portrayed him as a Russian stooge and a stalking horse for Donald J. Trump.

The California High-Speed Rail Authority approved the final Environmental Impact Report for an extension from San Francisco to San Jose.

SAN JOSE Calif. -- The California high speed rail governing board approved the final environmental documents Thursday for the San Jose-to-San Francisco section completing clearance of the project's Northern California leg.

The California High-Speed Rail Authority's Board of Directors approved the environmental impact report and statement for the roughly 50-mile stretch which will utilize the right-of-way currently used by Caltrain.

High speed rail officials have now approved the environmental clearance documents for 420 miles of the project's 500-mile span between San Francisco and Anaheim.

""If nothing else what it does is it really prepares and moves this entire project forward towards construction with of course a very important component of generating capital that's necessary to get the job done"" board Chair Tom Richards said. ""But for the state of California it really provides the basis for a project that's ready to do just that.""

RELATED: High Speed Rail Authority picks SF to SJ Silicon Valley to Central Valley route

The San Jose-to-San Francisco section of the project is expected to have three stops at the San Jose Diridon Station the Millbrae transit center and the Fourth and King Street Caltrain station. Once fully complete the section will be extended to terminate at the Salesforce Transit Center.

The High-Speed Rail Authority and Caltrain plan to collaborate to convert some at-grade rail crossings along Caltrain's right-of-way to safer above-grade rail crossings. Increased fencing will also be added to remaining at-grade crossings in an effort to prevent vehicles and pedestrians from accessing the tracks.

The project was kick-started in 2008 when voters approved a $9.95 billion bond measure to support a high-speed rail network linking Northern and Southern California which was initially projected to cost roughly $30 billion and be completed by 2030.

Since then the price tag has soared north of $100 billion and High-Speed Rail Authority officials have yet to determine where most of the funding will come from to complete the first phase connecting San Francisco and Anaheim let alone a second phase that would add spur connections between Merced and Sacramento and Los Angeles and San Diego.

Construction has steadily moved along in recent years though with a 119-mile stretch between Madera and Wasco in the Central Valley on track to be the project's first completed section in the next year.

That section will then be extended to include Merced and Bakersfield. That full 175-mile section is expected to be operational by the end of the decade according to rail authority officials.

While the source of funding for the Merced to San Francisco section is to be determined the environmental clearance will enable final design work and construction to begin immediately once funding is secured.

""We look forward to working with all of our regional partners and stakeholders in developing modern sustainable transportation infrastructure completing our work in the Central Valley and connecting to the Bay Area as soon as possible"" Richards said.

A marriage is about two individuals but the wedding ceremony is a coming together of two different families and their guests. Food is a huge and critical part of every wedding ceremony and at times can lead to heated discussions. Families want to serve the most memorable food as let’s be honest most of us attend weddings for the feast.

Shruthi and Abhishek were already following a vegan lifestyle when they decided to get married. It felt only natural to want the festivities to also celebrate their life choices and values. They wished to use it as an opportunity to start a conversation about a vegan lifestyle. At a South Indian Brahmin wedding food served is always vegetarian but with a generous and sometimes hidden use of milk curd and ghee.

Vegan First spoke to the newly weds Shruthi and Abhishek to understand how they pulled off a big Tamizh-Kannadiga wedding ceremony spread over three days with lavish vegan feasts throughout.

Let’s start with a little about both of you.

Shruthi: I am a software engineer. I work with Amazon in Seattle.

Abhishek: I also work in Seattle work for Salesforce. We've both been in the US for 7 years now. We went to same grad school. Moved to different cities then reconnected and found that we bonded. Started off as a long distance thing—she on the West Coast me on the East Coast—but we made it work.

Were you always vegan? Or is that a newer journey?

Shruthi: It’s (relatively) new. We’ve been vegetarian all our lives so the transition has been easier I should think. We’ve been vegan for a year.

Abhishek: We’ve had conversations about going vegan for about 6 years. I feel bad looking back now about not becoming vegan sooner. Because of COVID and not having to go to office we’ve been able to make this a shared experience.

Shruthi: We have struggled with different products personally during the transitions. I struggled with yogurt/curd.

Abhishek: For me I couldn't give up whey protein as I couldn’t find an alternative. And plant based proteins didn’t suit me as I have a gastrointestinal problem.

What was the reason you both went vegan?

Abhishek: A little of everything—sustainability ethicalness and health…But I’m much more of a staunch ethical vegan. Shruthi is more of a practical vegan. She looks at it from all angles but for me even if it’s not bad for the environment you should still be vegan.

Shruthi: At the start of COVID I was reading a lot about climate change so that played a big motivator. And the facts about animal cruelty was also a big one.

What about the idea of a vegan food at the wedding… was that natural or something you needed to think through?

Abhishek: In traditional South Indian weddings they use a lot of dairy. It didn’t sit right that we were going to spend lakhs of rupees on dairy food. From the start of the planning process we insisted that we need to try our best to make this a wedding one with vegan food. In South India there have been trailblazers before us but the pathways weren’t as well established as we would have liked it to be. It’s certainly been a challenge but I’m glad we persevered.

Was the main idea to be plant based or/and sustainable environmentally friendly?

The main idea was to focus on a vegan meal. Our message was about animal cruelty. We felt that would get people to consider it and maybe switch. They often don’t know how they are hurting animals. We did get the caterer to also segregate the waste and compost. But that wasn’t the focus.

So you decided to have a huge vegan feast at the wedding but was it easy?

Abhishek: For the longest time there were no vendors we could find in the South or they were all in North India and they couldn't figure out the transportation logistics. This was a huge hurdle. We were in the US so was hard to find vendors and get contacts. In the last one month or so we found vendors in Chennai. They all came together locally with quality products and at a great price.

Special call out to Wegun—run by a couple Umamaheswari and Jaya Surya. Just a few weeks before the wedding when we were still struggling we got their contact from Mr. Aravindan of Vijay Sweets Coimbatore. They are some of the kindest and most earnest people you will ever meet. After getting to know them our menu actually expanded. They brought a lot to the table and gave us a lot of confidence.

Tell us about the feast you served at the wedding but firstly the challenges!

Abhishek: When we approached several leading caterers in Chennai with our proposal most turned us down as they'd either never heard of veganism or felt they didn't have the know-how. Some felt that using vegan alternatives to traditional dairy products would negatively impact the quality of the food and feared their reputation would take a hit. For the few that agreed to take on the challenge we relied on our families to go to these caterers for 'taste tests' to evaluate their attempts at vegan traditional South Indian food.

We approached Vinayaka Catering services. They are also one of the big players in the summer wedding space. We spoke with Mr. Sriram and from the outset he was totally open. He was worried about his reputation but willing to experiment as he'd never done a vegan wedding before.

Shruthi: His (Abhishek’s) parents had visited us in the States and we had started the conversation about serving vegan food at the wedding. Since there were with us they were exposed and knew the products available. With my parents it was more challenging because they have not been exposed at all. The products available in India are vastly different from the ones in the US. Without knowing the concept fully or ever having tasted vegan products my parents were the ones who had to go for tastings with caterers who were willing to take on the challenge.

Tell me about what all you served at your vegan feasts and the high-points!

We had a three day wedding. We served a variety of dishes you would see at any South Indian wedding. There was all the traditional food with the regular side dishes on the banana leaf. We experimented a bit at the reception.

We sourced ice cream from a vegan ice cream supplier in Chennai called Baba Ramdev run by Ashok Kumar. They take a mango or an orange scoop it out mix in icecream and put it back. We had guests eating two to three servings.

We had the opportunity prior to the wedding to eat at The Viridian Plate Chennai's only all-vegan restaurant. After being blown away by the food and the warmth of owners Gayathri and Shankar we decided to order something from them for the wedding too. They helped supply us with delicious Chocolate Mousse and a Pumpkin Kheer.

Shruthi: We even served chaas/buttermilk through the three days. Vinayaka even made the bakshanam—the sweets and savoury items given to the guests as they leave the wedding on the last day—without any dairy using vegan alternatives. It turned out really great.

Crumbheaven is a bakery in Chennai that creates custom all-vegan cakes for events and ceremonies. Ms. Smuruthi who runs the business was incredibly kind to take our order on short notice and created an amazing black-forest tiered cake for us!

So how did your guests react?

Shruthi: For a couple of meals I was actually going to my cousins and asking them if they liked the food did they find anything different? Everyone was taken aback by my question because they didn't even realise that things had been substituted. They couldn’t tell the difference. That was important for us.

Abhishek: We didn’t want to give any room for people to be like oh this could have been better.

We had this huge flex banner at the entrance saying the food at the wedding was all vegan and explaining why it was important. Many were curious to see how it tasted. They wanted to go try everything on the menu. It did start a good conversation.

What was the BIG WOW from this experience?

Abhishek: Before the wedding I had relatives come to my parents and say if you are vegan you should get small amounts of food made just for you let the rest of us eat normal. That has changed after the wedding. It was very successful.

Some of the guests who came to our wedding started talking about Veganism. They didn't even know what it was before. Now they are seeing vegan options available to them in food. My sister is vegan but was skeptical that an Indian wedding feast could be vegan but now she has seen it happen.

Tips for others who wish to have a vegan wedding: Go Local!

Abhishek: Try to source as locally as possible because there are a lot of family businesses trying to gain a foothold in the vegan market. These local providers are often very friendly and accommodating.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL3NlY3VyaXR5L3RoaXJkLXBhcnR5LWFwcC1hdHRhY2tzLWxlc3NvbnMtZm9yLXRoZS1uZXh0LWN5YmVyc2VjdXJpdHktZnJvbnRpZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Third-party app attacks: Lessons for the next cybersecurity frontier,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='venturebeat.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /security/third-party-app-attacks-lessons-for-the-next-cybersecurity-frontier/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159B91A5A80>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL3NlY3VyaXR5L3RoaXJkLXBhcnR5LWFwcC1hdHRhY2tzLWxlc3NvbnMtZm9yLXRoZS1uZXh0LWN5YmVyc2VjdXJpdHktZnJvbnRpZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Local officials say downtown is recovering much faster than is indicated by a national study which looked at only part of downtown.

Residents are moving in. Events and unique businesses are drawing people in on weeknights and weekends.

But the return of office workers is lagging behind in Cleveland and elsewhere and that pillar of downtown’s economy may be forever changed.

“We have to pivot” said Cleveland Mayor Justin Bibb. “We are not going to see a large majority of the workforce working downtown five days a week. I don’t believe that’s the new normal.”

How is Cleveland’s recovery going by the numbers

Bibb and Michael Deemer CEO of the Downtown Cleveland Alliance said downtown has seen positive headwinds to be optimistic about.

The area saw 4.14 million visits in June a 77% recovery compared to pre-pandemic numbers according to the DCA’s monthly reports. Downtown now has about 20500 residents adding 1500 during the pandemic Bibb said. And there’s a net gain of more than 40 new small businesses.

Visits to downtown offices were lower in June at 60% of pre-pandemic levels although Deemer said the national average is just 50%. Office traffic in downtown Cleveland was at 52% in May.

In May the DCA and city launched several events like pop-up block parties and live music and a new campaign to attract workers.

This all shows that Downtown Cleveland is doing better than recent national research would suggest Deemer and Bibb said.

A report from Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California Berkeley which looked at 62 cities pegged downtown Cleveland as one of the slowest to recover ahead of only San Francisco. But it didn’t look at all of Cleveland’s downtown.

Deemer said and researchers confirmed that the study only looked at the 44114 Zip Code which is mostly area north of Euclid Avenue and east of Public Square. It didn’t include the JACK Cleveland Casino Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse or the Warehouse District.

The DCA’s definition of downtown stretches much farther and includes the Flats.

“I don’t think the study tells us anything useful about downtown Cleveland because it excludes so much” Deemer said.

The map shows the area the U.C. Berkeley study determined was downtown versus the area the Downtown Cleveland Alliance measures as downtown. The U.C. Berkeley study in red painted a more grim picture of downtown than locally conducted studies.Courtesy of the City of Cleveland

Karen Chapple lead author of the study said zip codes aren’t always an exact fit for downtowns.

“If I were studying downtown Cleveland alone I might define it differently” she said in an email. “But when I’m comparing it (to) 61 other cities it is the most apples-to-apples approach out there.”

Both the national study and the DCA’s study used cellphone data. Deemer said DCA is also looking at security card swipes at offices.

The U.C. Berkeley study said Cleveland’s recovery was at 36%. Deemer and others said that figure was far too low.

Business owners say the lack of office workers is noticeable

But the lack of office workers has been noticeable said Laurie Torres owner of Mallorca on West Ninth Street and president of Cleveland Independents an organization of locally owned and operated restaurants.

She said unless there’s a baseball game at Progressive Field or show at Playhouse Square people aren’t coming downtown. And the midday foot traffic has taken a hit.

“The only reason I stay open for lunch is because we’re 26 years old and we have customers that have been coming for 26 years.” Torres said.

Torres said she blames a lack of office workers and the lack of vibrant shopping centers a role Tower City and the Galleria used to fill she said.

She said the DCA has done a good job of creating excitement but says it won’t be enough to attract people who prefer working from home.

“No one is going to leave from home to come downtown for lunch in the square” Torres said.

Deemer said restaurants have changed their hours with some not opening for lunch. It’s sort of a chicken or egg issue but he said they’ll need to up foot traffic during lunch hours before restaurants open.

Doug Price CEO of K&D Group one of the largest landlords in downtown Cleveland said the office market is also concerned. “We’re seeing major employers downsizing” he said.

KeyBank recently subleased space in the Higbee building to Sherwin-Williams according to a report from the Cleveland Business Journal. Insurance giant Progressive Corp. though not downtown recently put several buildings up for sale near its Mayfield campus.

“I just worry about the future because I hear rumblings about when leases are up a lot of people are talking about downsizing” Price said.

His larger tenants he said are having a hard time convincing employees to come back to the office.

Price said Cleveland needs to attract new large employers to fill office space. Deemer said keeping offices full is a focus for the DCA but in the wake of COVID-19 retention of current employers and attracting back current employees has taken precedence.

Baiju Shah president and CEO of the Greater Cleveland Partnership said employers are caught in a balancing act. Some want to bring employees to the office more often while a number of the employees want to continue to work from home at least part time.

Where are The Workers a study sponsored by Fund for Our Economic Future and others polled close to 5000 working age adults in Northeast Ohio and showed there’s a desire for a new normal.

Just 56.2% of workers surveyed said they worked fully from an office or workplace but only 36.7% of workers said they want to be in the workplace full-time and 45.9% said they want to work fully or mostly from home.

The study also found that for every five workers currently employed one of them plans to quit in the next 12 months and 2-in-5 said they’ll look for a new job.

“That balancing is still going on especially in the tight labor market we still are in” Shah said.

Downtown’s future

Bibb said there’s been positive momentum but acknowledged there’s a long way to go. Early in his term he said he brought together the DCA GCP and key executives across town to work together on downtown.

He said the city needs to reactivate public spaces. That includes new special events at areas such as Playhouse Square or Mall C. It also includes upgrading infrastructure.

Deemer said making downtown more vibrant includes upgrading sidewalks adding bike lanes keeping the area clean and safe and a host of other things.

He said areas with more offices may see more challenges. But downtown for the most part will rise together.

“I don’t want to sugarcoat it” Deemer said. “There’s a lot more work to do. We’re not satisfied. We need to continue bringing workers back in. But a lot of our focus at DCA is the downtown experience overall.”

Bibb said the future of downtown Cleveland is a place where people can live work and play. It can’t become what it was before the pandemic he said.

Torres of Mallorca said COVID-19 accelerated some trends that were already happening. She said she expects workers to eventually stop working from home and is thrilled that Sherwin-Williams picked Public Square for its headquarters.

She stressed a healthy downtown’s importance to the rest of Cleveland.

“If the middle crumbles that means the box is hollow and everything else is going to crumble too” Torres said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NkYXkuY29tL2NsYXNzaWZpZWRzL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlL3JldHJvLWJvbGQtY29sb3JzLXI4cHAxMTVi0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3c2RheS5jb20vYW1wL2NsYXNzaWZpZWRzL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlL3JldHJvLWJvbGQtY29sb3JzLXI4cHAxMTVi?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to get a retro-inspired look with bold colors,"By definition primary colors are the most basic of hues. When mixed together these elementary colors form every other shade on the color wheel but no other colors can be blended to create red yellow or blue. The primaries represent the most intense purest forms of color and this vibrant combination is beginning to establish itself as one of this year's top color trends.

The playful palette received a shoutout in Sherwin-Williams' color trend forecast for 2022 and primary colors appeared prominently in Pantone's predictions for next spring and summer. This resurgence of primary colors broadly used throughout the postmodern movement of the 1980s reflects a general fondness for throwback styles we've seen across interior design fashion and pop culture.

Because of their intensity decorating with primary colors can be tricky. To learn the strategies to pull off this daring combination we tapped a few designers for their go-to strategies. Use these tips to stylishly decorate with a primary color scheme.

1. Use subtle variations

In their original form primary colors can be a bit jarring. For a subtle take on this trend Texas-based interior designer Kim Armstrong suggests using variations of primary colors in a looser interpretation. For example swap in turquoise for true blue or use metallic gold finishes in place of yellow. Experiment with different shades to put your own spin on this classic color scheme.

2. Select one color

Instead of using each of the three colors equally throughout the space designate one as the star and consider the others supporting players suggests Mark Lavender a Chicago interior designer. Apply yellow as the wall color for instance then bring blue and red through furniture throw pillows wall art and other decorative accessories. Or select one red statement piece and accent it with small hits of yellow and blue.

3. Tone down with neutrals

Balance the brightness of primary colors with soft neutrals. ""I like to pair them with calmer more subdued color tones such as white gray and browns"" says Eddie Maestri a Dallas-based interior designer. Start with a foundation of white walls to make primary-colored accents pop or soften their vibrancy with soothing grays and warm wood tones.

4. Boost sophistication with texture

Primary colors bring energy and brightness to interiors but they often lack the sophistication of other palettes. To add richness and depth Armstrong suggests decorating with lots of texture. For pillows throws and upholstered furniture select tactile fabrics such as plush velvet buttery leather or nubby linen. Rich wood finishes and natural materials like stone or rattan can also introduce a more elegant feel.

5. Bring in bold patterns

Match the energy of a primary color scheme with patterns that feel equally bold and playful. Maestri likes using simple geometric patterns for a subtle nod to postmodernism. Armstrong on the other hand suggests incorporating floral motifs. Because these colors appear naturally in gardens and meadows introducing primaries through floral prints ""feels very natural and not forced"" she says.

Overall the best way to decorate with primary colors is whatever appeals to you. ""Be fearless"" Lavender says. ""Color is your friend and creates happy spaces.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb29zZWphd3RvZGF5LmNvbS9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2dyZWF0LXNlYXNvbi1vbi10aGUtZmllbGQtbGVhZHMtdG8tZ3JlYXQtc2Vhc29uLW9mZi10aGUtZmllbGQtZm9yLW1pbGxlci1leHByZXNzLTU3MjE4NzHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Great season on the field leads to great season off the field for Miller Express,"Team president Darryl Pisio talks how things went for the team while the boys of summer were putting together their winning ways

To say the least it was an incredibly successful Western Canadian Baseball League season for the Moose Jaw Miller Express.

From their winning ways on the field that saw the local crew hold down first place in the East Divsion right until the final week of the season to the incredible fan support right from the opening game and their amazing run right to the final game of the WCBL championship series it was a season to remember in Moose Jaw.

All that success on the field translates into success off the field and Miller Express president Darryl Pisio couldn’t say enough about how outstanding the 2022 campaign was after so much time away due to the pandemic.

“We’re extremely happy with how things turned out this year after two years of being away from the game it was nice to get back” Pisio said. “Then it just built from there the players just kept on getting better and better and winning and winning and the excitement just continued to build throughout the year. So it was awesome.”

The Express finished their regular season with a 33-23 record and were only caught for first place by the Regina Red Sox on the second-last day of the campaign. That success carried over into the playoffs where they swept the Swift Current 57’s defeated Medicine Hat in three games and took the powerhouse Okotoks Dawgs to three games -- including a memorable Game 2 win in front of close to 1000 fans at Ross Wells -- before falling in the WCBL Final.

By literally every measure that’s one heck of a successful campaign.

“When you lose the last game of the season it's never fun but you take a step back a day later kind of reflect on things and you realize that there were a lot of amazing things that happened this year” Pisio said. “It's all attributable to everyone really from the players to the coaches from fans to billet families to sponsors volunteers you name it. It's nice just to see some excitement happening in Moose Jaw and everyone just embracing it.”

Fans also had an opportunity to enjoy plenty of upgrades both practical and cosmetic at Ross Wells Park just the start of what Pisio expects will be a host of improvements in the coming years.

All that work could have come with a hefty price tag but as per usual the Moose Jaw community stepped up. Businesses donated time money and effort to help with the renovations making Ross Wells that much better of a place to visit.

“There's a huge list that we can go through” Pisio said. “You have Cypress Paving helping us out with the paving and getting it done quickly for us. Elite Coating Systems and Rental Rehab helped us out a bit Western Lumber donated some supplies and United Rentals helped out with the painting as well. Then Sherwin Williams of course with their huge donation of paint. And Strictly Fences did some great work too.

“So it comes down to the fact that you just have an entire community behind you wanting to help out in any way. And it even leads into Homestand 2022 happening on Sept. 10 last year River Street Promotions had some of the proceeds go to Ross Wells and they’re doing the same this year. All those things have greatly helped. And it just speaks volumes of the people in Moose Jaw wanting to embrace and support it.”

Even better news? It’s just a start with consultation coming up soon that could make things even better for 2023.

“There's a lot of people that use the diamonds and the park and we’ll be talking to [Ross Wells board president] Charlie Meacher about what he would like to see done next” Pisio said. “I know that the lighting is probably a big thing that needs to get completed that will be back in the city's hands to hopefully help with that. But right now it's just one small step at a time and we're moving in the right direction which is awesome.”

Then there are the team finances. With the amount of support the Miller Express had from fans this year including several games that cracked the 750 mark in attendance Pisio wouldn’t be surprised to see things turn out well on the ledger book this season.

“We'll see how the numbers come out but we're confident that things will be okay for next year” he said.

One thing that’s certain the 2022 campaign was memorable -- and will be for a long time if how fans reacted to their on-field heroes is any indication.

“Tamara [Pisio] was with some of the guys at the bank exchanging their Canadian cash for U.S. cash and people were recognizing them and taking pictures with them and just thanking them for a wonderful season” Pisio said. ”So it’s really cool how much all this meant to the community and we’re hoping we’ll be able to have another great season next year.”",,,,,,

Scheels which counts aquariums arcade games and an indoor Ferris wheel among its attractions intends to raze the mall’s former Sears location and construct a 250000-square-foot store that could open by the fall of 2024 said Casey Stowe senior vice president of finance and real estate for PartnerTulsa the city’s economic development organization.

“It’s a huge investment” Stowe said. “We think it will not only lift up the mall but lift up the entire retail corridor by the traffic it will drive. … It’s a regional draw. We should be drawing from really the entire Green Country region.”

The company plans to employ 450-500 people 40% of whom will be full-timers Stowe said. Mall owner Simon Property Group is a leading partner on the project which is contingent upon incentives that must be approved by the Tulsa City Council a city official said.

The City Council on Wednesday will consider a resolution declaring the intent to consider approval of a project plan and creation of a new sales tax increment financing district. The resolution will begin creating the legal framework to allow the city to capture a portion of the sales tax generated by the company for economic development.

“This is an incredible win for Tulsa and I am very excited to have Scheels a one-of-a-kind store come to our city” Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum said in a statement. “When you think about the jobs this will create and the people who will be coming from all across the region to visit our city because of Scheels it’s just an incredible testament to the teamwork that went into making this happen.

“I want to thank PartnerTulsa for helping Scheels find a way to expand their business into our state — and I want to thank Simon Property Group for their persistence in ensuring that whatever went into the former Sears space was something that would be a major win for Tulsa and for the 71st and Memorial area.”

Scheels which is employee-owned offers retail choices in hunting fishing camping golfing biking men’s and women’s fashion and team sports. Among the brands it carries are Nike Under Armour Yeti and Traeger. The Tulsa store would be the company’s first in Oklahoma and 34th nationally.

“I just think it’s an incredible opportunity for our region” said City Councilor Lori Decter-Wright who represents the district that includes Woodland Hills Mall. “I’m excited that they want to be in Oklahoma and they chose Tulsa for their first store.

“… It’s just going to be a great re-energizer for that corridor. Malls and retail in general have been on the decline and certainly with COVID and everyone going to more online (shopping) this is going to be the next revitalization to that area.”

Sears was among Woodland Hills’ anchor stores when the mall opened in 1976. Sears closed that location after filing bankruptcy in late 2018. The site’s current occupant Overstock Furniture & Mattress has posted signs that it is closing.

The proposed store would abut District 8 where Phil Lakin serves as city councilor.

“Scheels is a game-changing addition to Tulsa’s largest sales-tax-generating corridor” he said by phone. “Financially this investment will provide substantial revenue to support public safety and fix streets. Equally as important is the unique experience Scheels will bring to this area which needs continual reinvestment so people from all across the region will want to visit to shop eat and simply have fun.”

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

West Stanly’s varsity football team entered Friday’s season opener with South Stanly having won the last eight seasons against the Bulls.

Hosting South Friday West took advantage of turnovers and mistakes to stretch the win streak over South to nine with a 45-0.

The shutout for West (1-0) was the third time the Colts blanked South Stanly in the last nine years. The shutout was also the first since the shortened 2020 season.

The Colts limited the Bulls (0-1) to 37 total net yards of offense and three first downs two of which came on penalties.

West running backs Matthew Parker and Shane Mecimore scored two rushing touchdowns each as the Colts finished with 221 net yards on 26 carries averaging 8.5 yards per rush. Mecimore finished with 112 yards on just four carries including a 59-yard scamper to the end zone while Parker added 84 yards on nine carries.

The Colts also got passing touchdowns from starting quarterback Carson Morton and backup Jett Thomas. Both TD passes were hauled in by West wideout J.T. Barbee.

South lost two fumbles in the game and had a bad snap on a punt deep in the Bulls’ territory which set up a short scoring drive. The Bulls also were whistled for 97 yards on 11 penalties while West had four penalties for 50 yards.

“I just give credit to all the linemen out there” Parker said about the West running game. “They contribute a lot. I just follow the players and run.”

Parker’s first touchdown saw the senior get out in the open field in a one-on-one situation with a South defender. Parker faked and got past the defender en route to the end zone.

“I just try to be a little shifty sometimes” Parker said. “I’m looking at the end zone; that’s what I’m doing.”

West head coach Brett Morton said converting turnovers and mistakes “is Football 101. If you can force turnovers and capitalize normally you’ll have a good night. We worked and worked to generate more opportunities for us to get the ball and it paid off tonight.”

The Colts coach added West executed well on offense in the first half and said the defense “had a good night” adding the West defenders “got off the ball fast and read their keys well.”

Morton recalled not being able to play the team’s first two home games last season because of COVID restrictions saying opening with a big win like West did Friday “means everything to start as fast as we did and capitalize on the momentum moving forward.”

The second of West’s three county games this season will be right back at Larry Wagner Field this Friday when the Colts host Albemarle (0-1). The Bulldogs lost 14-0 at home Friday night to Thomasville.

If you’re wondering if it’s worth the switch we’ll outline what’s possible right now.

If you haven’t noticed the arrival of Snapchat Plus for $US4 ($6) per month $US22 ($31) every six months or $US40 ($56) a year you can get a few extras that normal users don’t get: As well as access to Snapchat on the web there’s the option to pin one of your friends to the top of the chat list a choice of exclusive Snapchat icons for your home screen custom Bitmoji backgrounds and a few more perks.

OK it’s not the most appealing subscription package right now but Snapchat is promising to add more features over time — and if you spend a lot of time in the app (and want to be able to spend a lot of time on it in your browser too) you might consider it worth it. You also get priority replies to celebrities on Snapchat so your responses appear above everyone else’s.

Snapchat for Web lets you send snaps from your webcam. (Screenshot: Snapchat)

Web access is perhaps the most interesting of the Snapchat Plus features that have been announced so far. As demonstrated by Instagram — another mobile-first app that now has a web interface — being able to cover your social media duties while sat at a computer can be a lot more convenient. You’ve got a bigger screen to look at you’ve got a proper keyboard to type on and you can more easily switch back and forth from other tasks.

Once you’ve paid your dues for Snapchat Plus you need to head to Snapchat for Web log in using your credentials confirm your login on your phone in the Snapchat app and then you’re ready to go. Click Turn on your camera to send Snaps to give the site permission to use your computer’s webcam.

You’ll see you can start composing a text message just by clicking on someone’s name in the chat list on the left or by clicking the compose button in the top left corner (the blue and white one). This is actually one of the best uses of Snapchat for Web especially if you’ve got a lot of typing to do to individual contacts or to groups. You can send message reactions and save messages in the chat once you’re in a conversation.

You can make calls and send text snaps. (Screenshot: Snapchat)

Snapchat for Web lets you make audio and video calls too: When you’re inside a chat you’ll see the buttons up in the top right corner. You can also use the same compose button that’s available for text messages only when you’ve picked out a contact click on Start Call instead of Chat.

What you can’t do at the moment — and we’re assuming this will have to change pretty soon to make the service worth it — is open up pictures and video that you’ve been sent. You need to use the mobile app to view these snaps and even after you’ve opened them they don’t appear in the web interface (though there is a placeholder showing if they’ve been seen or not).

You can send photo snaps from the web interface once you’ve granted access to your webcam — but again you can’t actually view them in conversation threads. Only text overlays are available so no stickers or scribbles and unless you can only get a certain shot using your webcam you’re going to want to use the mobile app to compose and send snaps. At the moment it’s a pretty bare bones experience in that regard.

Snapchat for Web is most useful for text-heavy conversations. (Screenshot: Snapchat)

The same can be said for the settings on Snapchat for Web which you can open up by clicking on your avatar right up in the top left corner of the interface. You’re able to choose between a light and a dark theme or you can follow the load of whatever operating system you’re using and… well that’s about it.

One other interesting observation worth making: The web interface recognises when you switch away to a different browser window or tab hiding whatever conversation you were looking at. It’s a neat security feature that might help you protect your chats from being viewed by someone else peering over your shoulder.

If you’re wondering if Snapchat for Web makes the Snapchat Plus subscription worth it right now the answer is probably not — not unless you do a lot of texting through Snapchat and not until there’s better integration in terms of photo and video snaps in the browser app. There’s no doubt it’s going to get better over time though and more viable as an alternative to the mobile apps.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9zcG9ydC9zcG9ydHMtbGlmZS9taWNoZWxsZS1qaWdnbGluZy1qZW5uZWtlLWNhdXNlcy1zdGlyLW9ubGluZS13aXRoLWJpa2luaS1zbmFwLW9uLWhvbGlkYXlzL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvOTU4ZDZhZTAzYTA4YTgxNzIzODM3NzlhZTY0NWZjMzXSAaMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3cy5jb20uYXUvc3BvcnQvc3BvcnRzLWxpZmUvbWljaGVsbGUtamlnZ2xpbmctamVubmVrZS1jYXVzZXMtc3Rpci1vbmxpbmUtd2l0aC1iaWtpbmktc25hcC1vbi1ob2xpZGF5cy9uZXdzLXN0b3J5Lzk1OGQ2YWUwM2EwOGE4MTcyMzgzNzc5YWU2NDVmYzM1P2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Jiggling’ Jenneke snap sends fans wild,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.news.com.au/sport/sports-life/michelle-jiggling-jenneke-causes-stir-online-with-bikini-snap-on-holidays/news-story/958d6ae03a08a8172383779ae645fc35 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9zcG9ydC9zcG9ydHMtbGlmZS9taWNoZWxsZS1qaWdnbGluZy1qZW5uZWtlLWNhdXNlcy1zdGlyLW9ubGluZS13aXRoLWJpa2luaS1zbmFwLW9uLWhvbGlkYXlzL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvOTU4ZDZhZTAzYTA4YTgxNzIzODM3NzlhZTY0NWZjMzXSAaMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3cy5jb20uYXUvc3BvcnQvc3BvcnRzLWxpZmUvbWljaGVsbGUtamlnZ2xpbmctamVubmVrZS1jYXVzZXMtc3Rpci1vbmxpbmUtd2l0aC1iaWtpbmktc25hcC1vbi1ob2xpZGF5cy9uZXdzLXN0b3J5Lzk1OGQ2YWUwM2EwOGE4MTcyMzgzNzc5YWU2NDVmYzM1P2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Because modern meteoric δ2H correlates with seasonal temperature change in South Georgia and Lake Diamond water δ2H integrates a somewhat enriched annual precipitation average (see Figs. 1c 2) we expect reconstructed values to capture changes in temperature and evaporative 2H-enrichment. To better constrain this paleo signal we disentangle the different plant sources producing our sedimentary n-alkanes and the environmental signals they record in the text below.

While aquatic photoautotrophs directly use lake water for biosynthesis35 terrestrial plants use soil moisture35 which is often isotopically skewed towards the growing season when biosynthesis occurs46 and differently impacted by evaporative enrichment than lake water4748. This is particularly true for closed (endorheic) basins like Lake Diamond due to their long water residence time20. To constrain these different δ2H source signatures we differentiate between aquatic and terrestrial n-alkane producers. It has previously been argued that mid-chain (C 21 -C 25 ) n-alkane homologs are produced by aquatic plants whereas long-chain (C 27 -C 33 ) compounds typically derive from terrestrial vegetation4950. Recent studies have called this generalization into question515253. Here we rely on reported n-alkane distributions from representative terrestrial vegetation at nearby Grytviken to understand the sources of n-alkanes in Lake Diamond (Fig. 1a)54. Critically this selection comprises two species that dominate the Lake Diamond catchment today: tussock grass and greater burnet (see Fig. 3a). As can be seen in Fig. 4 mid-chain homologs are negligible in these terrestrial plants but abundant in sediment samples. This is in line with evidence from upwind southern Patagonia where these compounds are attributed to aquatic macrophytes55. We thus argue that mid-chain n-alkanes are primarily synthesized by aquatic producers in Lake Diamond. In this respect we note that moss patches in the catchment only contain traces of Sphagnum32—the only peat-forming species synthesizing considerable amounts of mid-chain n-alkanes5657. The inference that mid- and long-chain homologs derive from different sources is supported by Principal Component Analysis (PCA: see methods). The ordination diagram of Fig. 5c separates these homologous groups on PC2. Based on these lines of reasoning we infer that mid- and long-chain n-alkanes derive from aquatic and terrestrial plants respectively.

Confidence intervals are based on down-core variations of LDP2 samples (see Fig. 6). Full size image

Full size image

Down-core n-alkane δ2H values can also be affected by vegetation shifts because of species-specific differences in apparent fractionation between source water and leaf waxes355859. To constrain vegetation changes in the catchment area over the past 7 ka we use palynological evidence and n-alkane Average Chain Length (ACL: see methods). The pollen data seen in Fig. 3a show that tussock grasses (Festuca contracta) and greater brunet (Acaena magellanica) have dominated terrestrial plant cover around Lake Diamond over the past 7 ka. The stable abundance of Callitriche antarctica and Montia fontana the only mid-chain n-alkane-synthesizing macrophytes preserved in the Diamond pollen record suggest aquatic vegetation also changed little60. Supporting this evidence both ACL values and concentrations of mid-chain (C 21 -C 25 ) and long-chain (C 27 -C 33 ) homologs fluctuate around a stable mean throughout our study period (Fig. 3a–c). Finally we find no relationship between n-alkane abundance and δ2H values of various homologs indicating that the inferred minor vegetation changes do not explain changes in isotope values (Fig. 5a b).

Hydrogen isotope values of all analyzed n-alkanes are relatively stable on centennial timescales from the beginning of the Lake Diamond record until ~2150 cal. yr. BP (Fig. 6). Variability then visibly deviates from this long-term mean as also indicated by change-point analysis (see methods). Deviation from the long-term mean is primarily captured by hydrogen isotope values of mid-chain aquatic homologs (δ2H aq ) which become progressively more positive. In contrast hydrogen isotope values of long-chain terrestrially derived homologs (δ2H terr ) exhibit a different and more subdued response that does not significantly deviate from the long-term mean (Fig. 6b). As noted modern water samples from Lake Diamond are indistinguishable from amount-weighted annual precipitation δ2H values which in turn track surface temperatures on South Georgia at seasonal timescales (Fig. 1c). Based on the calculated δ2H-temperature dependence of 5.83‰ °C−1 (Fig. 2b) the observed ~100‰ δ2H aq shift to more positive values during the past two millennia would require ~17 degrees of warming. As local and regional temperature reconstructions reveal a shift towards moderately cooler annual (~1 °C) and growing season (~2 °C) conditions during this period (Fig. 6a)274461 this is highly implausible. Furthermore the dissimilarity between changes in δ2H aq and δ2H terr values suggests that at least one of these records does not simply reflect δ2H values of precipitation. We also exclude large variations in precipitation seasonality: as the isotopic composition of soil moisture used by land plants is typically skewed towards the growing season when biosynthesis occurs62 the observed isotopic enrichment of δ2H aq would also be captured by δ2H terr if caused by an increase in less negative (relatively 2H-enriched) spring-summer precipitation (see Fig. 1c).

We interpret the shift to more positive δ2H aq values after ~2150 cal. yr BP to reflect an increase in evaporative enrichment of the lake water during this time. The observed positive shift in δ2H aq values as well as their 2H-enrichment relative to δ2Hter are both characteristic of basins with a negative water balance2047. As noted (see setting and approach) evaporation is often an important source of water loss in closed (endorheic) basin lakes like Lake Diamond6364. Because evaporative isotope enrichment can outweigh other environmental controls on δ2H values in leaf waxes and because the positive hydrogen isotope shift during the past two millennia (the Common Era) is only recorded in Diamond Lake by lipids derived from aquatic plants that track lake water35 our interpretation provides an explanation for all of the observations without invoking unreasonable changes in temperature or the seasonality of precipitation. It also allays concerns that the incidental spills of glacial meltwater inferred by29 left a detectable imprint: as this water source is 2H-depleted65 substantial input would result in isotope changes in the opposite direction of what we observe in our record.

Based on the strong seasonal link between meteoric δ2H and temperature in South Georgia (Figs. 1c 2b) and the tendency of terrestrial compounds to record precipitation δ2H in small catchments like that of Lake Diamond66 we infer that down-core δ2H terr values reflect temperature change. As seen in Fig. 6 this interpretation is supported by the fact that the most prominent feature of our δ2H terr record—a ~20‰ oscillation towards heavier isotopic values between 1200–600 cal. yr BP—coincides with warming phase South Georgia273060.

To quantify the impact of lake water evaporation through time we calculate the isotopic difference between δ2H terr (taken to reflect δ2H of precipitation) and δ2H aq (taken to reflect δ2H of precipitation and evaporative enrichment of lake water) after20 subtracting δ2H terr from δ2H aq  and defining this parameter as ε terr-aq . We chose the C 29 and C 23 n-alkanes to represent terrestrial and aquatic lipids respectively based on their maximum separation along PC2 (Fig. 5c) and use their δ2H values to calculate ε terr-aq change through time.

Due to core top sediment loss in LDP2 and extensive sub-sampling of LDS229 we have no measurements of δ2H terr and δ2H aq for the past 500 years (see Fig. 6). To extend our inferred evaporative enrichment reconstruction into this period which overlaps with notable regional climate transitions including negative and positive phases of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and the culmination of the Little Ice Age (LIA)1267 we rely on proxy-to-proxy calibration68. Specifically we use sediment organic content (measured by loss on ignition or LOI) as a substitute for measured ε terr-aq values during this interval (see methods) based on (1) statistically significant (ρ = 0.66 p < 0.001 n = 14) correspondence between these measurements (Fig. 7 and methods section) and (2) available LOI data from surface core LDS2 (Fig. 3b). We cannot be certain why this strong link between LOI and ε terr-aq exists but widespread evidence for contemporaneous climate deterioration argues against an increase in lake productivity (Fig. 6a c)2769. Vegetation change also seems an unlikely culprit as the previously discussed pollen evidence from Lake Diamond reveals that Holocene variability was minimal and unrelated to measured δD values (see section 2.1 and Figs. 3a 5b). Finally the non-significant anti-correlation (R2 = −0.03) between LOI and the mass-specific magnetic susceptibility (χbulk)-derived glacier reconstruction by29 allays concerns about the imprint of dilution with glacigenic clastic input during the investigated period. We hypothesize that the correlation between LOI and δ2H aq values can be attributed to the impact of inferred lake evaporation on water levels: particularly in a shallow and conically-shaped basin like Lake Diamond29 low stands focus organic deposition into the center where our cores were extracted70. In support of this hypothesis we also observe a strong (ρ = −0.52 p < 0.05 n = 13) correspondence in LDP2 between ε terr-aq and Pediastrum (Fig. 7)60. The abundance of this green algae genus is widely used as an indicator of lake level shallowing71 also in upwind southern Patagonia72. As Pediastrum synthesizes some mid-chain n-alkanes73 we should re-iterate that there is no relation between the abundance and isotopic value of these homologs in Lake Diamond (Fig. 5a).

For the latter purpose we excluded values (n = 7) from the ~2.4–2.7 ka BP to avoid closed-sum effects from dilution with alluvial clastic input during this time as reported by ref. 29.

Wind-driven evaporation during the past two millennia

We propose the inferred increase in evaporative water loss from Lake Diamond after ~2150 cal. yr BP was driven by strengthening winds. The previously discussed evidence for local and regional cooling at this time rules out direct temperature effects (Fig. 6a)274461. We also reject decreasing relative humidity as an explanation because such a change would be reflected by an increase in δ2H ter values due to leaf water enrichment48 which we do not observe (Fig. 6b). Our interpretation is supported by macrofossil evidence from peatlands sensitive archives of sub-Antarctic surface water balance7475 which reveal a sharp transition ~2200 cal. yr BP towards colder wetter (humid) conditions in South Georgia (Fig. 6c).

Variations in wind strength can leave a measurable isotopic imprint on closed (endorheic) basins in the SWH core belt like Lake Diamond76. Nearby paleoclimate records indicate that wind strength indeed increased after ~2150 cal. yr BP when ε terr-aq began to deviate. A record from neighboring Annenkov Island shows an increase in the accumulation rates of long-distance transported (LDT) pollen—an established indicator of wind strength7778. Further upwind (52.5°S and 72.6°W) close to the Andean crest where strengthening of the westerlies is coupled to an increase in orographic precipitation79 the amount of hygrophytic pollen increased throughout the last two millennia80. A similar trend is observed in upwind Lago Guanaco (51.5°S and 72.5 °W) where (1) a carbonate-derived δ18O-based reconstruction of the balance between wind-driven precipitation and surface evaporation from Lago Guanaco is similar (ρ = 0.53 p < 0.001 n = 35) to our inferred wind-driven evaporation record from Lake Diamond during the overlapping ~100–950 cal. yr BP period (Fig. 8)21 and (2) gradual wind-driven precipitation increases during this period are reflected by the dominance of forest over grassland40(Fig. 9d). We attribute the delayed response of the latter transition to the well-documented nonlinear relation between regional changes in vegetation and climate19.

Links to the southern annular mode (SAM)

The Lake Diamond ε terr-aq wind-driven lake evaporation reconstruction suggests that the past two millennia were characterized by major regional shifts in core belt SHW strength that appears unmatched in the past 7 ka. As seen in Figs. 8 9 the transition towards windier conditions seems to mark a major reorganization of the regional climate system as the pattern of change observed in Lake Diamond broadly coincides with (1) pronounced annual cooling towards a post-glacial temperature minimum off the northeastern Antarctic Peninsula (Fig. 9b)—recorded by ice core δ2H values from James Ross Island (Fig. 1a) and (2) extension of the sea ice season towards a Holocene maximum along the western Antarctic Peninsula (Fig. 9c) as indicated by a rise in sea ice diatom biomarker concentrations81. A concomitant increase in seabird-derived phosphorus (P) from a rookery on the Falklands also attests to the broad ecological impacts of these climatic changes (Fig. 9e)82. Sea ice cover and wind stress have a major impact on the sub-Antarctic food web through impacts on the transport of nutrient waters as well as productivity and feeding8384. This reconstructed pattern of coupled cooling mid-latitude westerly intensification and the Bellingshausen Sea ice expansion is diagnostic for a negative phase of the Southern Annular Mode or SAM128586. The SAM is the main pattern of Southern Ocean climate variability9 and affects the strength and position of the SHW by modulating the atmospheric pressure gradient between 40–65°S (see introduction). There is a strong correlation (Spearman’s correlation coefficient ρ = 0.75 p < 0.0001 n = 35) between our inferred evaporation record and the sole annual SAM reconstruction that extends back to 1000 CE demonstrating that Lake Diamond sediments indeed capture shifts in the behavior of this dominant regional climate mode (Fig. 8)12. These also include the positive SAM trend—characterized by less windy conditions over Lake Diamond—during the past 500 years. We thus argue that our reconstruction of wind-driven evaporation is linked to SAM variability over the past 7 millennia. However to acknowledge that links with SHW strength (1) depend on the choice of index and reanalysis data22 and (2) could be non-stationary through time13 we refer to SAM-like changes in the following paragraphs after85. Concretely we define these as changes in wind-driven evaporation that were likely driven by shifts in the meridional pressure gradient.

Positive modern SAM phasing was not unprecedented during Holocene

The Lake Diamond record provides valuable information concerning long-term SAM behavior. Notably the period from 7 ka BP until ~2150 cal. yr BP was comparatively stable and mostly characterized by positive SAM-like conditions (Fig. 9). Based on baseline data that do not extend beyond the past millennium13 it has been argued that today’s positive SAM phasing—is attributed to a combination of anthropogenic greenhouse forcing and ozone depletion1187—falls outside the range of natural variability8. Our findings indicate that this may not be the case and that the negative SAM polarity of the past two millennia was exceptional rather than today’s positive phasing. While acknowledging the possibility that the relation between wind-driven evaporation in Lake Diamond and the SAM is non-stationary beyond the past millennium13 we use the relationship (R2 = 0.65 p = 0.000) between the Lake Diamond data and the SAM index by12 to approximate modern limits. Based on this basic calculation we find that ε terr-aq values greater than −45‰ exceed the observed 1999 CE SAM maximum (Fig. 9a). Notwithstanding the uncertainties of this simple approach it highlights that SAM values have been near or exceeded observational limits during most of the Mid- to Late Holocene and underscores the potential of this period to better understand the impacts of a more positive SAM which is predicted for the future87. Our findings corroborate previous proxy-derived evidence that strongly positive SAM phases do not require anthropogenic radiative forcing1385. Taken together this body of work hints at the possibility that internal variations which will be super-imposed on future anthropogenic change but remain poorly resolved in climate models87 play a critical but undervalued role in driving SAM shifts.

Was SAM-like change driven by Northern Hemisphere cooling?

In the following discussion we examine whether the multi-centennial Common Era climate variations captured by the Lake Diamond record and other reconstructions of SAM-like change in Fig. 9 could have been caused by modes of internal variability. Specifically the El Niño-southern oscillation or ENSO14. El Niño events are associated with negative SAM phases because positive temperature anomalies in the Tropical Pacific trigger Rossby wave trains that propagate positive pressure differences poleward88. Conversely La Niña events coincide with positive SAM phases as ensuing Tropical Pacific cooling leads to low sea-level pressure anomalies in the sub-Antarctic. Recently it has been shown that these connections also operate on centennial timescales17. However while the reconstructed SAM minimum ~500 cal. yr BP (Fig. 8) coincides with a phase of El Niño-dominated conditions89 no consistent link exists between records of SAM-like variability and ENSO reconstructions90. Indeed there is growing consensus that ENSO-SAM links are non-stationary1391 and also depend on the strength of the latter92. In light of this evidence we note that the Common Era excursion captured in the Lake Diamond record and the other records of SAM-like change in Fig. 9 coincides with the onset of ENSO strengthening to a Holocene maximum9394. Such long-term trends are however often characterized as ENSO-like and attributed to other mechanisms that likewise affect tropical Pacific surface temperature change88.

There is for example mounting evidence for a global atmospheric teleconnection that is (1) considered analogous to ENSO as it also impacts equatorial convection but (2) driven by the temperature gradient between Earth’s hemispheres and (3) operating at the multi-centennial timescales resolved by our record95. The emerging observational model-based and proxy-derived evidence supporting this framework shows that differential extratropical temperature change increases poleward heat export to the cooler hemisphere969798. To facilitate this the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) moves into the warmer hemisphere so that more energy is transported across the equator99100. A similar response is observed during ENSO variations as the ITCZ migrates south into a warming South Pacific during El Niño events and vice versa during La Niña101. Critically model experiments reveal that this feedback also alters the strength and position of the core SHW belt through poleward Rossby wave train propagation102—a key characteristic of modern ENSO-SAM interactions88.

To assess whether this global atmospheric teleconnection may help explain the Common Era excursion observed in our isotope record and the other reconstructions of SAM-like change shown in Fig. 9 we focus on anticipated changes in ITCZ position and meridional temperature gradient95. In light of the presented shift towards anomalously negative SAM values (Figs. 8 9a) and the association of this state with El Niño-like (negative ENSO) conditions88 these include evidence for a southward ITCZ migration in response to Northern Hemisphere cooling or Southern Hemisphere warming. Proxy evidence from the sensitive southern limit (15°S) of the present-day South American ITCZ reveals major contemporaneous precipitation increases—the main expression of such a shift103. As seen in Fig. 9f this is recorded by a sharp increase in freshwater plankton abundances in oligohaline Lake Titicaca from 2 ka BP onwards104. A transition from dry savanna to a wetter rain forest reflected by a sharp rise in Moraceae (mulberry) pollen ~2160 cal. yr BP in southern Amazonia (13–14°S)105 also supports this interpretation. Both observations are in broad agreement with global evidence for a southward ITCZ migration during the Late Holocene in response to orbitally-driven Northern Hemisphere cooling96106. This trend was amplified during the last two millennia by the negative radiative effects of Arctic sea ice expansion107 and is identified as one of the major temperature shifts of the Holocene108. Recent proxy-validated simulations even identify this feedback as the main driver of global temperature change during the Common Era109.

As seen in Fig. 9g the evolution of this cooling mode tracks the millennial-scale trend of mid to late Holocene SAM-like variability in our study region and shows that cooling rates intensify around ~2100 cal. yr BP. To further investigate the correspondence between the Common Era SAM-like changes discussed here and (relative) Northern Hemisphere cooling we compare our Lake Diamond reconstruction and the millennium-long SAM index of12 to the temperature contrast between the extratropics (30–90°) of both hemispheres (North minus South)—a measure of Earth’s meridional temperature gradient. To do so we rely on the area-weighted ensemble means of the 30° latitude average presented by110. Figure 8 underlines that the Northern Hemisphere cooled differentially during this period and reveals a notable degree of agreement (ρ = 0.55 p < 0.000 n = 22) with coeval SAM-like changes.

Following the above we argue that the inferred shift towards a negative SAM-like state after ~2150 cal. yr BP is consistent with a change in Earth’s thermal gradient in response to amplified Arctic cooling. Our findings thus provide additional evidence for the existence of a previously hypothesized atmospheric teleconnection that links the high latitudes in both hemispheres and impacts SHW strength88. This raises the possibility that ongoing amplified Arctic warming may (1) reinforce the predicted trend towards a more positive phase of SAM87 and (2) impact the ability of the SHW to help regulate the global climate in the future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlY2l0eW1lbnVzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzIxL3JpY2gtc3RpbnNvbi1uYW1lZC1hcy1hLW1vc3QtYWRtaXJlZC1jZW8tcmVjaXBpZW50LWZyb20tYXRsYW50YS1idXNpbmVzcy1jaHJvbmljbGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rich Stinson Named as a Most Admired CEO Recipient from Atlanta Business Chronicle,"Photo provided by Southwire

Sheafer who’s been farming outside of Wheatfield for 10 years and farmed for 20 years in Crown Point before that will soon house a different crop that relies on the sun to produce a yield: solar panels.

“Approximately one-third of our ground is going to go into solar and I’m going to farm around it” Sheafer said on a recent morning.

The soil in Jasper County is sandy he said and every year his crops get stressed because of drought. He uses a no-till method for farming strip intercropping alternating sections of corn and soybeans to maximize the amount of sunlight each crop receives.

“I kept the better ground to farm. The land that’s less productive is going into solar” he said adding he looks at farming as an investment. “You’re just maximizing your return on that lesser ground.”

NextEra Energy Resources is proposing a $250 million investment in Porter County through its Malden Solar project with an estimated $52 million coming back to the county over the life of the project an estimated 35 years.

The project still in its preliminary stages has yet to receive approval from the county though NextEra is expected to ask for a tax abatement or other incentives for bringing the project here.

NextEra officials are mum on several aspects of the proposal including who the farmers are so far who have agreed to lease their property for solar array panels or the exact location of where the panels will go other than to say it includes land on either side of Smoke Road.

They did confirm that around nine farmers have signed on so far with another few possibly agreeing to lease their land. They also declined to identify who the farmers who signed prospective leases are unless the names are released during a public meeting or how much revenue they can expect to receive.

“It’s right there along Smoke Road. That’s the meridian line” said Matt Johnson developer of the project for NextEra Energy adding 80% to 90% of the land has been secured through lease agreements at about 1800 acres with the possibility of an additional 160 to 800 acres.

“It’s safe to say we have a project in Porter County” added Zachary Melda development director for NextEra who is based in Juno Beach Florida the company headquarters.

Dunns Bridge Solar in Jasper County

NextEra on its company website touts itself as “the world leader in electricity generated from wind and solar” with $135 billion in total assets.

On a recent morning officials from NextEra and Northern Indiana Public Service Company which is harvesting the wattage generated by the Dunns Bridge project offered a tour of the Jasper County work in progress in Kankakee Township near Wheatfield visiting different parcels of land in varying stages of completion.

That included parcels with solar array panels fully installed and others that had only the metal racks upon which they connect all secured behind chain link fencing. NIPSCO’s R.M. Schahfer Generating Station which is being shut down was visible in the distance.

The Porter County project is expected to be similar in size and scope to the first phase of Dunns Bridge Solar which should be finished by May of next year. The second phase of that project which stretches into nearby Starke County is expected to be complete in December 2024.

“Jasper County was always in a different position than what the Malden project would be” said Stephen Eastridge executive director of the Jasper County Economic Development Organization.

The Schahfer Generating Station is being shut down in stages and is expected to be out of service around 2025 according to NIPSCO communications manager Tara McElmurry. Dunns Bridge Solar she said is just one of the utility’s projects as the company moves away from coal to renewable energy.

The generating station Eastridge said provided almost 20% of Jasper County’s tax base when he started his job there in 2017.

“That retirement was a really big blow to our local government bodies” he said. “We had real concerns about our tax base and tax rate jumps.”

And that’s where Dunns Bridge Solar comes in. The Indiana legislature sets the value of agricultural property at $1250 per acre where the solar panels are going in Eastridge said. That will go up considerably with solar.

“It’s about $13000 per acre once it’s put in solar use” he said.

The Jasper County Council according to minutes from a March 19 2019 meeting approved a declining seven-year tax abatement for the first phase of Dunns Bridge Solar. The abatement approved unanimously by the county council has the county abating $1.4 million from a tax bill of a little more than $2 million.

By the seventh year Eastridge said NextEra will be paying its full tax liability.

The project according to the meeting minutes is expected to generate $35 million for landowners over 30 years. The estimated tax benefit to the county is projected at $24.5 million on a $300 million solar investment. Estimated annual revenue for the Kankakee Valley School Corporation is $660000 annually with other taxing units in the county benefiting as well.

Renewable energy in general is a hot topic Eastridge said and the project hasn’t gone without its critics.

“The biggest thing we come back to is ‘How does this impact my life? What am I going to look at when I leave my driveway?'” he said adding that makes up about 90% of the concerns he hears in the community.

The project can’t be stopped on that Eastridge said adding he also hears what he calls rumors based on bad science about chemicals from the solar panels leaching into the ground. People also talk about the loss of farmland.

“My counter argument to that is at the end of the day if it didn’t make financial sense it wouldn’t happen” he said. “This is some of the least productive land we have in Jasper County.”

Additionally he said farmers can continue farming the rest of their acreage while reaping the financial benefits of solar income that can be spent on equipment farm outbuildings and the like and invested back into the local economy.

“No matter what your opinion of solar or renewables is people still want power to plug their phones in” Eastridge said.

If or when the time comes that solar energy is no longer viable he said the county’s tax base will be stable and diversified by then and the county won’t “run into the same kind of cliff” it did with the retirement of the generating station.

Malden Solar’s build out will take 12 to 18 months and create 250 construction jobs Johnson said adding that depending on the permitting process and timelines Malden Solar could begin operation at the end of 2024 but that could change.

“We’re still at 1% of the total farmland in Porter County” he said adding the project’s footprint of solar array panels and the fencing around them will be around 1200 acres.

The ground coverage ratio for the land under the panels will be at 35% to 40% he said adding the actual footprint will be about 750 acres “less than half of a percent of the farmland in the county.”

Malden Solar does not yet have an agreement to provide its energy to NIPSCO which sends out requests for proposals for renewable energy projects said Andy Campbell NIPSCO’s director of portfolio planning and origination.

“If it’s not valuable to us for some reason it could be valuable to someone else” he said.

The Malden Solar project Melda said is within a few months of going to the permit stage with Porter County depending on landowners and environmental surveys are already underway.

Detractors raise concerns

Not everyone sees a promise in solar energy.

Darren Grieger lives a few miles from the Malden Solar site in Morgan Township. He’s been farming corn beans and some livestock on the property for eight years. He took the farm over for his grandfather and his family has been farming on the same land for five or six generations.

He has “so many” concerns about the project he said including the infusion of government funds into green energy projects which he called “bad business.”

Additionally Grieger said solar farms reduce the amount of land available for farming which could lead to an increase in production costs. He also questioned how truly green the solar panels are from how they’re manufactured and shipped from China — officials from NextEra Energy said most of their panels come from Vietnam though some are made in the United States — and how they’re disposed of. NextEra officials said 95% of the materials in the panels can be recycled.

The panels Grieger said are behind fencing so “it’s not like animals can graze” on that land. And while officials touted how the panels can be recycled Grieger said solar energy is still a relatively new field and it could be cheaper to toss them in a landfill than to recycle them.

“It’s not going to be just Malden. It’s going to spread if this passes” Grieger said adding he doesn’t see any benefit to the solar farms.

“I think it’s a really inefficient way (to generate electricity) but it’s being pushed so hard by these solar companies because there’s so much government money behind it” he said.

He expects a “domino effect” of farmers leasing their land for solar panels lured by the promise of additional income and other farmers jumping aboard.

“Nobody wants to live next to it” he said.

Officials don’t always welcome solar farms either.

NextEra had proposed a solar farm dubbed Brickyard Solar for Zionsville in Boone County north of Indianapolis according to published media reports. The proposal for a 1200-acre solar farm straddled city limits into unincorporated Boone County thereby requiring approval from both city and county boards.

The city’s board of zoning appeals denied a special exception request for the solar array. The county’s advisory planning commission also rejected the proposal stating that it deviated from the county’s comprehensive plan which said the area was supposed to stay in traditional agricultural production. NextEra subsequently withdrew its proposal about a year ago.

Robert Thompson Porter County’s director of development and stormwater management said in an email that the county’s comprehensive plan “does not discuss clean or green energy solutions” and added that the plan was approved in 2002 but does not discuss that type of land use.

The county now has two small solar farms at around 10 acres each that produce about 1 megawatt each Thompson said. One of them is west of the Sedley Road bridge just south of Indiana 130 and the other is on Robbins Road adjacent to Portage city limits.

County officials expect that as is the case in Jasper County NextEra will request a financial incentive for any project here.

“Most Indiana counties have negotiated economic development agreements with the solar farm developers” Stu Summers a consultant working with Porter County as part of the team of county staff negotiating economic development agreements for solar farms said in an email.

“Typically the agreements require a bond to assure that at the end of the solar panels’ useful life the property will be returned to its original state allowing for renewed agricultural activities. Also counties have granted limited tax abatement in return for economic development payments from the solar farm operations.”

So far they have not reached an agreement Summers said but if they do it will require the approval of the Board of Commissioners and the County Council.

Nothing has been formally presented to the council for a tax abatement hearing Thompson said in an email. “There have been some very preliminary discussions on an economic package but nothing has been agreed upon as of yet or drafted up in an agreement format.”

‘A little bit of a gamble’

Sheafer the Jasper County farmer said he was approached around 2015 by Orion Renewables which came to the area to secure lease options for a solar project with the goal of putting the project together and selling it. The project was sold to NextEra Energy which is now developing it.

Sheafer who turns 60 next month has two adult children and neither is interested in farming. If they were he would have been less inclined to go into solar.

“The beauty of it is as we get older I don’t have to worry about weather because a percentage of our land won’t be cropped anymore” he said adding the returns on solar are roughly three times on average what he could make from farming the property.

While his property taxes will go up because of the added value of the land NextEra Energy will pay for any additional assessment beyond what Sheafer is paying now and will do so for the life of the lease agreement.

“There’s really no additional cost for us at all and I don’t have to put the crops out which is a lot of money” he said.

He understands folks who oppose taking their land out of farm production and homeowners against solar because of how it changes the view from their property.

“I get it. This is pretty to look at” he said sitting at his dining room table with his wife Anne and gazing out at his yard dotted with bird feeders and abutting alternating rows of corn and soybeans.

Both his traditional crops and his new one of solar panels capture the energy of the sun Sheafer said.

“It’s a little bit of a gamble” he said. “I hope we look back in 30 years and say ‘Yeah we’re glad we did this.'”

The 4488-square-foot building which sits on just over 3 1/2 acres at 2129 Lake Lansing Road has been empty for 13 years.

By next spring the building will be completely gutted redeveloped and reopened as a ""state-of-the-art"" McAlister's Deli said David Blackburn the owner of Southern Rock Restaurants L.L.C.

The company owns 135 McAlister's Deli franchise locations in 11 states including the location currently at the Eastwood Towne Center he said.

The Towne Center deli location will close and its current staff will move to the Lake Lansing Road building once work there is finished Blackburn said.

The additional space will help staff serve its growing catering business in the Lansing area Blackburn said. He expects to spend about $1.3 million on the property's redevelopment.

""We love the location there"" Blackburn said. ""It's highly visible centrally located. We're going to keep the structure. We'll gut everything in it to the studs. We are in the process now of just doing demo and gutting the location to prepare for a complete reimage.""

The building is about 25% bigger than the Towne Center location he said. Work on the building will include resurfacing the parking lot adding a window for pick-up orders a patio a larger kitchen and seating for 120 inside he added.

Those who routinely select the window seat know that some of the best views of the United States come from 30000 feet up — or at least while climbing to or descending from that altitude.

Want to make an otherwise ordinary descent into Chicago's O'Hare International Airport (ORD) memorable? Grab a window seat and enjoy a beautiful view of Lake Michigan.

On your way to New York for a meeting? Enjoy a few minutes of peace on your descent into LaGuardia Airport (LGA) with a spectacular view of Manhattan out your window.

No we're not suggesting forgoing that family trip to see the Grand Canyon in person. However you can often catch a glimpse of some of America's best views without even landing in that city or state. All you need is a seat on an airplane — a window seat that is.

Additionally apps such as Flyover Country use scientific maps to tell you all about the points of interest that you're passing over. All you have to do is plug in your flight path before you depart; the app works offline so you won't be reliant on data or often-spotty inflight Wi-Fi.

There are of course a few major caveats for getting the full experience: You'll get the best views of most of these sites when flying during the day although places like Las Vegas can be quite amazing at night. Another hard-to-control factor: the weather. It can be the difference between a beautiful view of the Earth and one of clouds alone.

With luck on your side here are the seven most scenic plane routes to remind you that they don't call it ""America the Beautiful"" for nothing.

Over the Grand Canyon

As we mentioned there's nothing like a real visit. However it never hurts to steal a glimpse of the Grand Canyon when you can.

There are many routes that take you over this natural wonder. These include transcontinental flights to Los Angeles flights into Las Vegas (sit on the right side) and short-hop flights from Phoenix to Salt Lake City (your best bet is the left side). Not only can you see one of America's greatest landmarks but the Southwest is an incredibly beautiful region in and of itself.

New York City: Landing or taking off at LaGuardia

Walking the streets of New York it's easy to forget just how big the city is. The best way to get a sense of the sprawl is from the air.

Most flights in and out of LaGuardia Airport (LGA) guarantee you some version of a view of the Manhattan skyline depending on the flight path. The left side will yield spectacular views most times but sitting on the right may be good too.

Winds and the runway in use will change so it's hard to predict where to sit but one thing is for sure: Keep your camera or phone ready day or night as New York will often dazzle you even before you set foot on the ground.

Niagara Falls: Albany New York to Chicago

While certainly not one of America's most-traveled routes flights from Albany International Airport (ALB) to Chicago can be a great means to an end: getting a bird's-eye view of Niagara Falls.

Book the left side of the plane for your best shot at a view of the majesty of the falls minus all the tourists. On a clear day the view can rival that of those below you who shelled out money for a pricey helicopter ride. This works with flights into either O'Hare International Airport (ORD) or Midway International Airport (MDW).

Golden Gate Bridge: Landing in San Francisco

San Francisco: So much to do so little time. In case you miss the chance to check out the Golden Gate Bridge in person you can catch it on the way into town.

On many flights arriving from Asia or Europe or from points north of the city a seat on the left side is a good bet for a great view of the bridge and city. Even if you only catch a quick glimpse of it like senior aviation reporter Ethan Klapper did on the final United Boeing 747 flight in 2017 it's a sight that's memorable nonetheless!

Yosemite National Park: Sacramento to Las Vegas

If you're flying from Sacramento International Airport (SMF) to Las Vegas' Harry Reid International Airport (LAS) a flyover of California's Yosemite National Park will send you off in style. Sit on the right side of the plane and keep your eyes peeled for the notable Half Dome.

Can't make the flight during the day? You'll always have the twinkling view of Vegas at night as a silver lining.

Landing in Washington DC

The left side of the plane is a good bet when landing at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA). If you're lucky your pilots will fly the so-called river visual. This winding approach over the Potomac ends in a southbound landing at Reagan. Passengers will get a view of the Washington Monument and Thomas Jefferson Memorial among other famous sights.

If you're sitting on the right side taking off in the opposite direction you can also catch a pretty good view of the National Mall area. TPG's Sean Cudahy got this view of the Washington Monument with the Capitol off in the distance when taking off from Reagan one night in October 2019.

The volcanoes of the Pacific Northwest: Taking off or landing in Seattle

The amount of volcanic beauty packed into the Pacific Northwest is unparalleled elsewhere in the U.S. When taking off or landing at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) you've got Mount Rainier Mount Hood Mount Adams Mount St. Helens and Mount Baker so close it feels like you could touch them. It reminds you of your place on Earth.

Snag a seat on the right side of the aircraft on takeoff hope that the winds are right and departures are to the north and prepare to be in awe. On landing in Seattle the left side is often the better choice to catch the best views.

Bottom line

Most of the time when we select a seat for a flight we factor in things like legroom proximity to the front of the plane and the restrooms.

There's another factor to consider next time you make a seat selection though: whether to sit on the left side or right in hopes of enjoying the best inflight sightseeing.

A bit of research before your next flight could go a long way toward getting you the best photos before you even land. Just be sure to book a window seat.

Currently JSX serves both destinations from other US cities; the pair will now receive a daily route using private terminals at each airport. JSX will begin service on September 29 from its Dallas Love Field (DAL) base to John Wayne Airport (SNA) in Orange County California.

The hub carrier at Dallas Love Southwest Airlines operates the route with its larger narrowbody: the Boeing 737. Nonetheless JSX presents an unconventional model to travelers in comparison to other U.S. airlines. One of the carrier's most prominent selling points is that passengers arrive and depart from private terminal facilities allowing for a more secluded and efficient experience. JSX touts its private lounge in the terminal and a quick security screening to allow for passengers to complete the check-in and security process in 20 minutes.

Additionally this service which will be operated by Embraer ERJ aircraft features a 1-1 seating configuration with over 36 inches of pitch and 19 inches of width. At first glance JSX flights seem more fitted for business travelers with a two-bag checked luggage allowance onboard cocktail service spacious legroom and free wifi. However the carrier appeals to leisure travelers by accommodating skis golf bags and snowboards as checked luggage.

JSX's service between Dallas and Orange County will take three hours and thirty minutes. Photo: JSX

Out of Dallas Love Field JSX delivers its unique experience via intra-Texas routes to business hubs like Houston and Austin routes to the Western U.S. like Denver and Las Vegas and routes to Florida like Destin and Miami. Meanwhile Orange County concentrates primarily on several intra-Western U.S. hops to Nevada Colorado and within California. This newest route out of Orange County represents a paradigm shift as JSX ventures to longer flying for the Los Angeles area.

Fares for this new route between Dallas Love Field and Orange Country start at a hefty $499 per passenger price point. In contrast at the time of writing Southwest charges $195 for a non-stop flight between Dallas and Orange County. While JSX is a more exclusive experience Southwest offers a generous checked bag allowance and a slightly faster 15-minute flight. It will be interesting to see the size in which JSX can mark its authority on the Dallas - Orange County route."

The incident which took place on Aug. 1 was manager Melissa Morris’s first day working at the Anderson Starbucks store.

She was walking into a volatile situation. Like many Starbucks workers across the country baristas at the store had become increasingly dissatisfied.

“We were tired of how management was treating us not listening to our complaints” says Aneil Tripathi 19 who took his first ever job in the Anderson store and led the unionization effort. “They haven’t stepped a foot on the floor they probably never made a drink in their life. And they’re telling us how to do our jobs.”

Tripathi recalled how on one particularly busy Sunday he found the store understaffed—three people were doing the job of six. He called the district manager for help. It was her day off and he could hear the TV on in the background. “There’s not much I can do” she told him. That day he sent an email to Starbucks Workers United—an independent labor union that has been organizing workers nationwide—asking for advice on how to unionize the store.

The unionization campaign at the Anderson store was a wild success. The May 31 vote was unanimous with all 18 workers voting to join. “It was kind of a big deal” Tripathi says because northern South Carolina is very pro-Trump and historically anti-union.

In response to the vote workers say management cracked down on the Anderson store. They were told they couldn’t wear pro-union T-shirts and management started unilaterally cutting their hours as well as shortening the store’s opening times.

Starbucks has been scrambling to respond to a wave of stores unionizing nationwide. In an effort to stem the flow the company announced on May 3 that it would roll out a new packet of benefits on Aug. 1 but there was a catch. Workers at unionized stores would not be eligible for the new perks. Instead each would have to negotiate their own contract individually.

The Anderson baristas had gone out on strike twice last month but this edict was the final straw.

“Our store was very frustrated” said Tripathi. The baristas reacted angrily to news they would be excluded from the very benefits they had been demanding and felt like it was retaliation for organizing.

So they began to plan a “March on the Boss” a federally protected direct action in which workers present their demands directly to their manager. They drafted a letter asking for new equipment for the store and demanding that they receive the same pay raise being given to non-unionized stores.

They planned to take action on Aug. 1—the day the new benefits were rolled out.

Originally the Anderson workers had planned to confront their store manager but she quit after the first strike. Their new manager Melissa Morris started Aug. 1.

“Unfortunately for her that was the day it fell on” says Tripathi.

The workers gathered around Morris and read their letter aloud.

“We are not going to move until some action is taken for our raise. No work is being done on the floor and no customers are being served” one worker told Morris in audio published by More Perfect Union on Twitter.

“We carried this company on our shoulders through the pandemic at the risk of our health and loved ones’ health” another worker tells Morris in the recording “and we have nothing to show for it.”

“We weren’t menacing” says Tripathi “We were a good distance away from her.”

Video of the incident released by Starbucks Workers United shows Morris sitting at a table in the store surrounded by 10 workers while another employee films the situation. While speaking to the district manager on the phone Morris stands up brushes past one of the workers and stops before reaching the door. Workers followed her to the door but did not block her path Tripathi says.

“No one was blocking the door” he told The Daily Beast. “The door was unlocked.”

“Will you let me exit the building?” Morris asks the workers still on the phone.

“Yes” Tripathi answered.

The entire interaction lasted around six minutes according to audio of the incident.

Two days later Morris filed a report with the Anderson County Sheriff’s Office alleging that her employees had kidnapped her at the store and “would not let her leave until they got a raise.”

“One employee also assaulted her” Morris told police and the incident was “captured on video” according to a police report viewed by The Daily Beast.

Morris was not immediately available for comment.

Police came to the store and interviewed workers about the kidnapping allegation.

“They saw that we’re not criminals we’re people who make coffee” Tripathi says.

On Aug. 6 Tripathi and 10 other workers at the store found out they were being suspended.

The store manager “felt threatened and unsafe as a result of conduct by 11 store partners” Starbucks said in a statement adding that they had been advised by law enforcement to suspend workers “until their investigation is complete.”

“They want to make an example out of us” says Tripathi who sees the suspension as direct retaliation for organizing.

The Anderson County Sheriff’s Office said a detective is still investigating the case and it has not been determined yet if charges will be filed.

“Bossnapping” or taking your boss hostage during a labor dispute is an unusual tactic but occurs occasionally in France where workers have been known to kidnap their employers for several days. The strategy is unknown in the United States.

“I cannot believe I have to say this but workers who are organizing for better working conditions should not have to deal with their boss accusing them of kidnapping and assault” Senator Bernie Sanders tweeted on Aug. 8 “How outrageous. This campaign of rampant union-busting from Starbucks has got to end.”

The kidnapping charge is just the latest example of Starbucks’s aggressive response to union organizing by its workers since the campaign began in Buffalo New York in 2021. To date 223 Starbucks stores have voted to unionize.

Tripathi believes Morris filed the police report on the advice of Starbucks management who are being counseled by Littler Mendelson—the high-powered law firm Starbucks has brought in to help them.

The firm which has also represented Apple and Trader Joes is notorious for its aggressive union-busting tactics.

To date Starbucks has fired over 85 pro-union workers at stores across the country according to Starbucks Workers United who also say the company is engaged in underhand illegal anti-union tactics including spreading disinformation closing stores intimidating workers retaliating against those who organize and attempting to halt elections.

On Thursday the National Labor Relations Board the federal body that adjudicates disputes between unions and management found that Starbucks had violated the law when they fired seven union-involved baristas in Memphis Tennessee. A judge ordered Starbucks to reinstate the workers and to “cease and desist from unlawful activities.” Starbucks said it disagrees with the verdict and plans to appeal according to a statement posted to their website.

The union has filed 291 unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB against Starbucks since their organizing campaign began. The Board has already found merit in 87 of these allegations accusing Starbucks of illegally interfering with and coercing workers and taking retaliatory action against organizers.

But it may take months or even years for the Board to wade through all the complaints and their enforcement power is limited.

“It really is kind of an amazing anti-union crime wave from this company that professes to be a progressive employer and to care about its people” says John Logan a professor and director of labor and employment studies at San Francisco State. Logan believes the harsh tactics Starbucks is employing are part of Littler Mendelson’s anti-union playbook.

“Hiring Littler Mendelson is like planting a flag and saying: we’re going to fight this union to the death” Logan says “It has unlimited resources with which to fight this campaign.”

Littler Mendelson founded in 1942 has grown into an enormous international firm employing thousands of lawyers across the world. The firm specializes in union-avoidance. It made more than $658 million in gross annual revenue in 2021 according to its website. In June the firm handed out average bonuses of $10000 to high-performing employees according to the legal blog Above The Law.

At least 50 Littler Mendelson lawyers spread across 17 states have been working for Starbucks in just the last three months according to a Daily Beast review of NLRB filings since June 2022. At least three of these lawyers are also representing Trader Joes which is engaged in its own battle against unionization efforts at its stores.

“It might be the most expensive anti-union campaign of all time” Logan says.

On Friday Starbucks workers at stores on North Broadway in Chicago and in Clifton Park New York voted overwhelmingly in favor of unionizing while a vote at a separate location in Louisville Kentucky was much closer with 10 people voting yes 7 voting no and 3 ballots being challenged.

Starbucks CEO billionaire Howard Schultz has taken an active role in anti-union efforts blaming outside agitators for stoking resentment among employees. Last month he told a New York Times event that he could not accept a future for the company with a union involved “because we have a different view.”

In Schultz’s 1999 memoir Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time Schultz recalls watching unionization efforts at Starbucks in the late 1980s.

“There is no more precious commodity than the relationship of trust and confidence a company has with its employees” he wrote “Once they start distrusting management the company’s future is compromised.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy52Y3N0YXIuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvbG9jYWwvY29tbXVuaXRpZXMvY29uZWpvLXZhbGxleS8yMDIyLzA4LzIwL3dvcmstc3RhcnRzLXRob3VzYW5kLW9ha3MtbmV3LXN0YXJidWNrcy1uZWFyLXNpbmdsZS1mYW1pbHktaG9tZXMvMTAzMzEwNDUwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Work begins in Thousand Oaks on new Starbucks drive-thru near single-family homes,"Work has begun on a new Starbucks drive-thru on the same Thousand Oaks site where the developer's previous plans to build a 7-Eleven and gas station were denied by the city amid community opposition.

Grading of the empty lot at 2198 N. Moorpark Road has been completed the city's planning manager Steve Kearns said Friday.

The next step is for the developer Megdal & Associates to obtain a work permit from the city to begin construction at the site which is near single-family homes and diagonally across the street from Thousand Oaks High School.

Before the permit can be issued however the developer must demonstrate that it has incorporated several changes into its plans that were required by the city Planning Commission when it approved the project in January 2021 he said.

Among the requirements is that a sound and privacy wall be increased from 6 feet to 8 feet high to address nearby residents' concerns about noise from the coffee drive-thru.

Thumbs down: Thousand Oaks Planning Commission denies 7-Eleven across from high school

Kearns said he didn't want to speculate on when the work permit will be issued.

""It's as quick as their architect can modify their plans resubmit them to us and then we can do a plan check and issue the permit"" he said. ""After that they can roll out their construction crews.""

It's been a long haul for Megdal & Associates to finally start developing the site.

Planning commissioners in July 2019 unanimously denied the developer's proposal to build the 7-Eleven convenience store and gas station there.

Prior to the commission's vote about 20 residents spoke out against the project arguing that it wasn't a good fit for their neighborhoods.

""Our community is a nice calm residential community with a great high school in the middle"" one of the speakers Robin Kaswick told the commission.

The project is ""not improving our community"" she said. ""It's a detriment to our community.""

Megdal & Associates appealed the commission's denial to the City Council but lost.

Thumbs up: Thousand Oaks green-lights 264-unit apartment project

The developer in 2020 submitted a new application to the city for the Starbucks. It came before the Planning Commission in January 2021.

The project ""integrates well with the surrounding neighborhood and has been designed to minimize impacts to existing single-family residential uses"" a staff report said.

Even so a number of residents spoke against it but not as many as at the 2019 hearing.

""I see this as a traffic and safety nightmare"" Amy Wilson told the commission. ""It is definitely going to change the scope of my neighborhood.""

Developer Taylor Megdal said that after the 7-Eleven project was denied his team did community outreach in which many residents were asking ""'Why don't you bring us a Starbucks?'

""So ironically we were able to get a Starbucks"" he said yet some residents are still opposed.

""You can't please everyone"" he added. ""But I can't tell you how proud I am of this proposal.""

The commission unanimously greenlighted the new project.

""I do like the fact that there were a lot less complaints this time from the community"" said Don Lanson a commissioner who served as chair at the time. ""I think a lot of people as much as they have concerns look at this as the best we can possibly do at this location.""

Megdal couldn't be reached for comment Friday.

""Starbucks has a problem"" Rachel Demarest Gold an employer-side attorney at Abrams Fensterman LLP told Yahoo Finance in a phone interview. ""By the time a workforce gets to the point where it's in an election for union representation the company already has a problem and probably has had a problem for a long time with its employees because satisfied workers don't turn to unions.""

The union drive at Starbucks stores nationwide began in December 2021 at a store in Buffalo New York and more than 310 stores in 36 states have filed for election petitions. Starbucks Workers United a subsidiary of the Workers United labor union is leading organization efforts.

According to records from the NLRB an independent federal labor agency with leaders appointed by President Biden more than 220 stores have voted in favor of unionization so far.

Starbucks has strongly opposed unionization with CEO Howard Schultz denouncing the ""threat of unionization"" and rolling out pay increases for store employees that exclude those at unionized stores.

NLRB regional offices have issued nearly 20 unfair labor practice complaints against Starbucks. The agency has also asked a court to halt the company's alleged union-busting campaign.

The coffee giant is now accusing the NLRB of impropriety: On Monday Starbucks sent a 16-page letter to NLRB officials accusing the agency of managing union elections in a way that unfairly helped workers unionize.

""It's tit for tat"" Gold said. ""It's an adversarial process. So if I find that you have done something wrong and it helps my case I'm gonna bring it up.""

Starbucks's letter to the NLRB

In the letter Starbucks alleged that the agency's regional staff repeatedly crossed the line of neutrality during an election in the Kansas City area by secretly coordinating ""in-person"" voting at the NLRB offices during a ""mail-ballot"" election giving union representatives confidential election information disenfranchising voters that did not cast in-person votes and mishandling ballots.

“The purpose of this misconduct was to tip-the-scale in order to deliver the outcome sought by the Union"" Starbucks general counsel stated in the letter. ""The result of the misconduct was to ignore — and bypass — the actual sentiments that Starbucks partners may have expressed in properly conducted elections.”

Story continues

NLRB press secretary Kayla Blado told Yahoo Finance in a statement that while the NLRB ""does not comment on open cases"" the agency has ""well-established processes to raise challenges regarding the handling of both election matters and unfair labor practice cases.""

Starbucks Workers United called the letter ""absurd"" and the allegations an attempt ""to distract attention away from their unprecedented anti-union campaign.""

The letter from Starbucks counsel requested that the NLRB immediately suspend all Starbucks mail-ballot elections nationwide and asked the board to stay a judgment that ordered Starbucks to reinstate seven workers in Memphis Tennessee who were fired earlier this year during an attempt to unionize a store.

The Starbucks letter is not without precedent: After an historic union election victory at a Staten Island warehouse Amazon (AMZN) by accused the NLRB of inappropriately leading the union to victory by coercing and misleading voters.

According to Matthew Bodie a former lawyer for the labor board who teaches law at St. Louis University Starbucks's public letter against the NLRB stands out for the intensity of its rhetoric.

The company is ""politicizing this by calling for a nationwide moratorium on these elections"" Bodie told Yahoo Finance in a phone interview. ""I think what they're angling for is to get some Republican lawmakers on board with questioning the integrity of the NLRB.""

Bodie added that the ideal scenario for Starbucks ""would be if the Republicans would take it either the House and or the Senate then there'll be hearings about NLRB election integrity and the Republicans will try and make the NLRB seem like a biased organization that can't be trusted.""

Hearings based on the accusations are ongoing with both sides presenting evidence. At some point Bodie explained the Hearing Officer ""will make her recommendation to the Regional Director of Region 29-Brooklyn who is handling the case on whether there should be a new election. The Regional Director will then make a decision on whether there will be a new election or if the results of the election will be certified.""

Not every drink can be everyone’s cup of tea (no pun intended) and that seems to be the case with the new Cold Brew with Lemonade according to employees on the internet.

In fact one TikTok creator was so shocked by the taste of the featured drink it made her gag. Yikes! Barista @kayli.cernan posted a video of herself trying the concoction for the first time. “New featured drink…. immediately no” she wrote in the caption.

The video which amassed more than 141.3K views shows Kay begrudgingly making the unique drink before taking a sip and gagging with disgust. Okay so we can assume this shouldn’t be at the top of our must-try list next time we pull up to Starbucks…

And it seems that many others have the same opinion including fellow baristas. “I was already horrified when I first saw the weekly update” one user wrote with another saying the “long lasting aftertaste is hell.” Another commenter even called this drink “traumatizing to try.” Yikes! That bad?!

Apparently it is that bad. Back in February when the Cold Brew with Lemonade was a “barista pick” (drinks only Starbucks Rewards Visa Card members can buy) baristas took to Reddit to express their distaste for the beverage going as far to call it a “sick joke.” The infamy!

Consumers across Twitter are also debating the quality of the drink. ""Lemonade and cold brew??? Capitalism did not pop off"" one user joked. ""Starbucks is foul for even promoting the Cold Brew and Lemonade"" another wrote.

However some are rushing to the defense of the unpopular beverage. ""Apparently the new 'add lemonade' option when ordering cold brew on the Starbucks app has generated some confusion and controversy. It's not for everyone but I like it"" another said. To each their own!

We have to be honest—even though everyone is saying it tastes terrible all of the controversy is kind of making us want to give it a try for ourselves. Is this marketing at its finest?! More importantly will you try it? Or have you already? Let us know in the comments!"

In fact they classify 105 cities in Missouri as Tree Cities.

What You Need To Know Arbor Day Foundation recognizes over 100 communities in Missouri as ""Tree City USA""



Any size community is eligible for designation



Ellisville Mo. has been recognized for 41 years as a ""Tree City""



Program extends past communities to colleges utilities and even health care campuses

The nationally recognized program sponsored by the Arbor Day Foundation and administered locally by the Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) aims to provide a framework to assist communities in establishing a healthy and sustainable urban forestry program.

Standards of the program

The program founded in 1976 aimed to educate citizens about the importance of trees to the environment and their own community by specifically developing urban forestry programs and proactively planting and caring for trees. Cities of any population from less than 100 to over 1 million can qualify.

To earn status as a Tree City a community needs to meet “four overarching standards.” Those include:

1. Maintaining a tree board or department

2. Having a community tree ordinance

3. Spending at least $2 per capita on urban forestry

4. Celebrating Arbor Day

Missouri by the numbers

As of 2022 the Arbor Day Foundation has recognized 105 communities in Missouri as Tree City USA communities equating to 45% of the state. Glen Echo Mo. population 150 is the smallest municipality in the state with this recognition. As for the largest that spot goes to Kansas City Mo. with a population of 441545.

The longest-running active tree city community is Mexico with 43 years and counting. St. Peters holds the spot for the longest active growth with 22 years.

Other notable communities in the St. Louis region that have received recognition include Ellisville with 41 years Des Peres with 39 years Brentwood with 34 years and Florissant with 32 years. St. Ann and Ladue are relative newcomers with three years of recognition each.

See if your community made the list.

The state has spent nearly $24 million on urban forestry management averaging $8.54 per capita. The reported number of trees planted stands at just over 14000.

Research has shown trees yield three to five times their cost in overall benefits to the communities that manage them. Trees can lower costs for storm water management by absorbing excess water and even help to reduce energy consumption.

Trees provide a positive impact for people as well by improving their overall health and property values.

Other programs

This initiative extends not just to communities but to several other entities as well including college campuses. St. Charles Community College University of Missouri St. Louis and Washington University in St. Louis all meet the criteria as Tree Campuses in our region.

Other programs along the same lines include Tree Line USA Utilities and Tree Campus Healthcare. All aimed at promoting the same cause trees.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8va2VueWFud2FsbHN0cmVldC5jb20vMjAyMi1ibHVlLWNoaXAtZGl2aWRlbmQtc3RvY2tzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2022 Blue-Chip Dividend Stocks | See All 357 | Yields Up To 8.3%,"Updated on August 9th 2022 by Bob Ciura for SureDividend.

In mid-July State Street reported (7/15/22) financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Fee revenues dipped -6% over last year’s quarter due to headwinds from weaker stock markets and bond markets.

However net interest income grew 25% thanks to higher interest rates and the bank generated high forex trading earnings and kept its total expenses essentially flat. As a result its earnings-per-share grew 11% sequentially from $1.57 to $1.74 and exceeded the analysts’ consensus by $0.20.

We expect annual returns of 16.6% per year for State Street. This will be driven by 7% expected EPS growth plus the 3.2% dividend yield and a sizable boost from an expanding P/E multiple.

Blue-Chip Stock #5: Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)

Dividend History: 14 years of consecutive increases

14 years of consecutive increases Dividend Yield: 2.8%

2.8% Expected Total Return: 16.8%

Comcast is a media entertainment and communications company. Its business units include Cable Communications (High-Speed Internet Video Business Services Voice Advertising Wireless) NBCUniversal (Cable Networks Theme Parks Broadcast TV Filmed Entertainment) and Sky a leading entertainment company in Europe that provides Video High-speed internet Voice and Wireless Phone Services directly to consumers.

Comcast reported its Q2 2022 results on 07/28/22. For the quarter the company’s revenues climbed 5.1% to $30.0 billion adjusted EBITDA (a cash flow proxy) rose 10.1% to 9.8 billion adjusted earnings-per-share (EPS) climbed 20.2% to $1.01 and it generated free cash flow (FCF) of $3170 million.

Comcast has had 14 consecutive dividend increases. The fast dividend growth was possible through solid earnings growth and a safe dividend payout ratio. Its dividend is well-covered by earnings and cash flows. Comcast is one of the largest players in the entertainment industry. New market entrants would have to spend many billions of dollars to establish as a key cable player or entertainment network.

The cable industry is impacted by the nationwide cord-cutting trend though as some customers are ditching traditional pay-TV entirely. Comcast has so far been able to withstand this trend through growth from its other businesses.

Blue-Chip Stock #3: V.F. Corp. (VFC)

Dividend History: 49 years of consecutive increases

49 years of consecutive increases Dividend Yield: 4.4%

4.4% Expected Total Return: 17.2%

V.F. Corporation is one of the world’s largest apparel footwear and accessories companies. The company’s brands include The North Face Vans Timberland and Dickies. The company which has been in existence since 1899 generated over $11 billion in sales in the last 12 months.

In late July V.F. Corp reported (7/28/22) financial results for the fiscal 2023 first quarter. Revenue of $2.26 billion rose 3.2% year over year and beat analyst estimates by $20 million. The North Face brand led the way with 37% currency-neutral revenue growth in the quarter.

However inflation took its toll on margins and profits. Gross margin of 53.9% for the quarter declined 260 basis points while operating margin of 2.8% declined 640 basis points. As a result adjusted EPS declined 68% to $0.09 per share.

Adjusted earnings-per-share grew 67% from $0.27 to $0.45 but missed analysts’ consensus by $0.02. For the new fiscal year V.F. Corp expects revenue growth of at least 7% and adjusted earnings-per-share of $3.30 to $3.40.

We expect 7% annual EPS growth over the next five years. VFC stock also has a dividend yield of 4.5%. Annual returns from an expanding P/E multiple are estimated at ~6.2% equaling total expected annual returns of 17.7% through 2027.

Blue-Chip Stock #2: Sonoco Products (SON)

Dividend History: 40 years of consecutive increases

40 years of consecutive increases Dividend Yield: 3.2%

3.2% Expected Total Return: 17.8%

Sonoco Products provides packaging industrial products and supply chain services to its customers. The markets that use the company’s products include those in the appliances electronics beverage construction and food industries. Sonoco was founded in Hartsville South Carolina in 1899 and introduced the first paper textile cone. The company generates about $7.2 billion in annual sales. Sonoco Products is now composed of 2 segments Consumer Packaging and Industrial Packaging with all other businesses listed as “all other”.

On July 21st 2022 Sonoco Products reported second quarter earnings results for the period ending July 3rd 2022. Revenue surged 38.4% to a company record $1.91 billion which was in-line with analysts’ expectations. Adjusted earnings-per-share of $1.76 compared very favorably to $0.84 in the prior year and was $0.11 above estimates.

Source: Investor Presentation

Consumer Packaging revenues grew 65.6% to a segment record $990.1 million due once again in large part to the purchase of Ball Metalpack that closed in the fourth quarter of 2021. Higher selling prices also factored into results. Global rigid paper containers had slight volume growth outside of North America where supply constraints limited business.

Flexible packaging volume grew 4% but was offset by mix. Industrial Paper Packing sales grew 20% to a segment record $727.4 million as higher selling prices more than offset a small volume decline and currency exchange headwinds.

Sonoco Products raised its outlook for 2022 as well with the company expecting adjusted earnings-per-share of $6.20 to $6.30 for the year up from $5.25 to $5.45 and $4.60 to $4.80 previously.

Blue-Chip Stock #1: Hanover Insurance Group (THG)

Dividend History: 17 years of consecutive increases

17 years of consecutive increases Dividend Yield: 2.4%

2.4% Expected Total Return: 18.4%

The Hanover Insurance Group Inc. (THG) is a holding company whose primary business is offering property and casualty insurance products and services. The company markets itself through independent agents and brokers in the United States.

In 2021 Personal Lines accounted for approximately 40% of segmented revenues; Commercial Lines 37%; Other Property & Casualty 23%. The company operates an investment portfolio that is primarily exposed to fixed-income securities.

In the 2022 second quarter the company reported adjusted earnings-per-share of $2.32 which beat estimates by $0.17 per share. Net premiums written of $1.33 billion rose 10% year-over-year and beat expectations by $100 million.

.

Source: Investor Presentation

During the past five years the company’s dividend payout ratio has averaged around 33%. With the current payout ratio of 27% THG’s dividend payments are well covered by earnings. Given the expected earnings growth there is still room for the dividend to continue to grow moving forward while maintaining a payout ratio below 30%.

The Hanover Insurance Group is a diversified and solid insurer with a differentiated P&C franchise in a fragmented market. With their differentiating strategy such as specialized products and distinctive agency partnerships the company can strengthen its competitive advantages. Furthermore Hanover Insurance has a S&P and AM Best “A”-rating and a stable outlook.

We expect 11% EPS growth over the next five years. In addition the stock has a 2.3% dividend yield while we expect 5.1% returns from an expanding P/E multiple.

Private equity for asset owners in the Asia Pacific has gone from the most popular to the least favoured alternative asset class within a span of six months according to the latest Asset Owner Insights (AOI) survey.

Its leading position has been replaced by real assets and private debt.

From October 2021 to end March 2022 asset owners in the region had increased their allocation to the private market from 15.3% to 21.5%. However private equity was the only asset class that showed outflows with overall weight dropping from a leading 4.9% to a mere 2.6%.



Asia-Pacific asset owners' asset allocation as of March 31 2022

Instead the largest increase was seen in private debt followed by infrastructure and real estate. Real estate remained the most popular alternative investment at 7.1%. Private equity was sharing the leading position as of the end of September 2021.

Asia-Pacific asset owners' asset allocation as of September 30 2021 (Source:AOI)

AOI is AsianInvestor’s proprietary data intelligence platform. The latest survey was conducted in April and May 2022 gathering datasets from 69 asset owners across the region. Total assets under management (AUM) of the respondents were $7.5 trillion as of end September 2021.

“From the fourth quarter of 2021 to the end of June this year we saw a mild drop of dry powder as the new fund raised was less than the capital being called in this period. It might be signalling a potential slowdown of private equity fundraising driven by higher market volatility and the denominator effect” said Eric Chng head of alternatives and insurance client segments for Asia Pacific at State Street.

The elevated market volatility since early 2022 has caused a slowdown in both investment and exit activities he told AsianInvestor.

Within the private equity space AOI’s latest data showed that investment was opting mostly for direct investments although growth funds were also of some interest. North America remained the top destination for private equity investment.

On the other hand allocation to private debt was on the rise. Infrastructure debt and direct lending were still the most favourable instruments within the space AOI data showed.

Real estate debt came third climbing up the weight ranks since the third quarter of 2021 when 70 asset owners with a total AUM of $5.35 trillion were surveyed across the region back then.

Regionally while North America was the most popular destination Asia wasn’t far behind.

“Portfolio diversification and the continued pressure for yield generation is driving allocation to private debt and infrastructure which appears to be more suited to the current market cycle” said Janet Li Asia wealth business leader at Mercer.

Queensland Investment Corporation’s (QIC) head of private debt Andrew Jones also noted that a rising rate environment is generally favourable to private debt investment. One of the benefits is that private debt investment is typically floating-rate loans which are correlated with interest rates.

Jones told AsianInvestor in an interview in July that it is expanding the private debt team as it sees rising investment demand from clients.

QIC is a sovereign wealth fund that also has external asset owner clients including superannuation funds in Australia other sovereign investors and insurance companies.

They are looking for differentiated but predictable yield with stability and added diversification to the portfolio Jones said.

In years prior buying a $200 phone meant sacrificing almost every single aspect of performance. Does the REVVL 6 Pro 5G from T-Mobile fit that same model? We had a chance to spend some time with the carrier’s newest $219 budget device.

When looking for a new device it’s important to eye up the competition. Google’s latest budget offering – the Pixel 6a – is an outstanding deal yet it will still end up costing you $449 at full price. Samsung also ends up in the ring with its Galaxy A-series devices which drive a hard bargain. Those can end up being a steal too at various low costs.

T-Mobile is looking to give us an enticing deal with the REVVL 6 Pro 5G a budget device that has some tempting specs listed on paper.

Hardware and display

As with any phone the very first thing you notice is the build quality. After all it’s arguably one of the most important parts of a genuinely good device.

The REVVL 6 Pro 5G has a surprisingly good build even though it’s made of plastic. The back holds a nice matte grey color and bears a frosted look and feel to it. The edges are plastic as well though it doesn’t give off that look so obviously. It’s also worth mentioning this device has a heft to it; not too much but enough to make you feel better about the materials.

The bottom of the device houses a USB-C port and a 3.5mm headphone jack – something you don’t see all too often. A nice touch you might notice at first glance is the colored power button made to match T-Mobile magenta. It isn’t all for looks though. That power button is one of the features that make the REVVL 6 Pro stand out among its budget friends – it’s also a fingerprint sensor. As far as accuracy goes the sensor gets it right about 7 out of 10 times.

Most devices in this price range rely solely on a PIN or passcode for device security. Since the REVVL 6 Pro has a fingerprint sensor you can easily unlock it with a comfortable tap of your thumb. Surprisingly the sensor is pretty fast. Touching it unlocked my device in less than a second which is perfectly acceptable.

In the front lies the absolutely massive display. The HD+ display comes in at 6.82-inches making for a huge viewing area. Unfortunately this is where you start to realize that corners were absolutely cut to get to the $219 price point this device comes in at.

The total resolution for the HD+ display is 1640 x 720. Comparatively the Pixel 6a comes in at 2400 x 1080 though it covers a smaller area. The REVVL 6 Pro by no means has a bad display rather it’s perfectly adequate for everyday tasks –hat I really struggled with was watching videos through YouTube and other streaming platforms.

Since the resolution isn’t very high the details are hard to make out and I found myself being pulled away from whatever I was watching. Paired with that the screen doesn’t get very bright automatically during everyday use and when manually adjusted you might be disappointed at max brightness as well. It can sometimes be a little hard to read the display at max brightness when outdoors or even when its bright inside.

Software and performance

The REVVL 6 Pro runs Android 12 something you’ll see in just about any phone sold now – other than Google Pixel phones. Out of the box the REVVL 6 Pro is equipped with July’s security patch and comes with tons of Google’s apps and software giving off a pretty stock experience mostly.

Since the device comes from T-Mobile you can expect it to be peppered with bloatware here and there. The REVVL 6 Pro will greet you with a T-Mobile splash screen when you first turn it on and unless you complete T-Mobile’s separate device setup you’ll see a static notification asking you to do so.

Additionally scrolling to the left from the home screen will take you to Google Discover a stock feature on most Android 12 devices. Accompanying it is T-Mobile’s version that showcases the same material though much less personalized.

Other than that T-Mobile’s skin isn’t a far reach from stock Android 12 and most of the experience is left unchanged. That experience is powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 700 SoC which is a 7nm chip that runs a 5G modem for fast connectivity. After all this is the REVVL 6 Pro 5G. That paired with 6GB RAM and 128GB expandable storage makes for an alright experience; everyday use could be a little faster though it’s completely usable and gets the job done.

The REVVL 6 Pro 5G runs a 60Hz display which is what you might expect for a device at this price point. Unfortunately it can often feel like less with the jelly scrolling issue you might come across on this device. This is more than likely a product of the lighter chipset used though it’s something you can ignore over a small time period.

Over a longer period of time you can likely expect T-Mobile to keep up with software updates as they did with the REVVL 4+ back in 2021. T-Mobile doesn’t have a concrete update timeline or promises set for any specific Android though the popularity of the budget device will likely influence how regularly its kept up to date.

Battery

If the REVVL 6 Pro 5G excels at one thing it’s battery life. Once fully charged the REVVL 6 Pro will idle for days on end. When in use I was able to get a full day with no problem on the 5000 mAh battery with scrolling through social media websites and sending and receiving messages.

Usage might vary but using this device under normal circumstances you should be impressed with how long you can keep going without a charge. A lot of this is probably due to the MediaTek Dimensity 700 being a power-efficient SoC. Since the device runs a low refresh rate and an efficient chipset 5000 mAh will keep it alive for a longer period of time.

Adding to the quality here is the fact that the REVVL 6 Pro comes with wireless charging. While not fast it’s convenient. It’s also not something you too often see at the lower end of budget devices. In all that’s an excellent addition.

Camera

Another area the REVVL 6 Pro absolutely stunned me was the camera. In total the REVVL has four sensors. It has a 50MP main sensor 5MP ultrawide a 2MP depth camera and a 2MP macro sensor. That’s a total of four different cameras in this array. Of course the lower MP sensors like the macro and depth lenses aren’t going to blow anyone away but the main sensor is surprisingly adequate.

Every photo has a good amount of detail and is mostly color accurate with a little bit of vignetting around the corners. The ultrawide lens does a good job of capturing details as well without sacrificing function for quality.

On the front you’ll find a 16MP selfie camera with a teardrop notch and while not a hole punch cutout the selfie camera still doesn’t take up a lot of room. The selfie camera takes pretty good images to my surprise as well.

The camera app itself is just fine though it can act a little slow sometimes. The REVVL 6 Pro isn’t going to be great for fast action shots as there s a bit of a delay when taking photos. For every day still shots the REVVL does a good job.

Final thoughts

All things considered the REVVL 6 Pro 5G performs just fine. Coming in at $219 you can’t expect much and going in I didn’t. Certain aspects of the REVVl 6 Pro – like the camera and battery life – genuinely surprised me. The camera is pretty sufficient for most applications and the battery life did not disappoint in the slightest. Sprinkled in there are a few more wonderful features like wireless charging and a physical fingerprint sensor.

As far as performance goes there could be a lot of improvement points though most woes are coming from the mid-range SoC inside the device itself. The 6GB RAM certainly helps matters and it does a decent job of keeping up with basic tasks.

If I had to pick an area I struggled with the most on the $219 REVVL I’d have to choose the screen. The resolution doesn’t lend itself to a very pleasing display and the jelly scrolling was a bit of a pain though not uncommon for this price point.

In all the REVVL 6 Pro definitely has its place. For $219 I’d say it’s a pretty good phone. If it were $50 more expensive I’d feel differently about it. The camera is solid and battery life is more than plenty for most people which makes for a good combination that makes up for some other aspects.

If you were stuck on a $200 budget this is one of the better devices you could get at this price. If you’re able to go over I’d consider a Pixel 6a since it has a lot of high-end features for only $449 – just over $200 more than the REVVL 6 Pro 5G.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsYXNoZ2Vhci5jb20vc3Rvcmllcy90LW1vYmlsZS1oYXMtZG9taW5hdGVkLXZlcml6b24td2lyZWxlc3MtaW4tb25lLW1ham9yLXdheS1pbi0yMDIyL9IBY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsYXNoZ2Vhci5jb20vc3Rvcmllcy90LW1vYmlsZS1oYXMtZG9taW5hdGVkLXZlcml6b24td2lyZWxlc3MtaW4tb25lLW1ham9yLXdheS1pbi0yMDIyLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,T-Mobile Has Dominated Verizon Wireless in One Major Way in 2022,Although Verizon is currently the largest cell carrier in the U.S. the second-place operator T-Mobile has overtaken the cell champ in one key metric: It managed to get more customers in its stores than its rival.

Most sports fans have experienced slow or undependable cellular service but one venerated sports franchise aims to solve the problem.

The New York Yankees and T-Mobile announced Thursday that they have teamed up to deliver improved 5G coverage to Yankee Stadium with speeds up to five times faster than previously available.

More 5G upgrades are to come to the stadium next year the announcement said. The current Yankee Stadium opened in 2009 replacing the previous ballpark of the same name next door in the Bronx.

“Yankee Stadium is home to one of the most iconic franchises in the history of American sports” Neville Ray President of Technology at T-Mobile said in the release. “Now New Yorkers and people visiting from across the country to catch a game have access to ultra-fast reliable 5G so they can share more of that experience.”

Ultra Capacity 5G will be available in some parts of the stadium while LTE inside the ballpark will also be upgraded for those with older phones.

“We are excited to have the power of T-Mobile’s Ultra Capacity 5G network in Yankee Stadium and look forward to continuing to work together with T-Mobile to enhance the in-Stadium experience for our fans” Mike Lane the New York Yankees Chief Information Officer and Senior Vice President Technology and Broadcasting said in the release.

To mark the occasion the Yankees sent a drone around Yankee Stadium filming the concourses club level and down to the field itself into retired numbers and Monument Park. Retired Yankees greats Bernie Williams and Hideki Matsui were part of the presentation.

In addition to the newly announced Yankee Stadium deal T-Mobile has purchased naming rights in several cities. The Seattle Mariners home stadium formerly known as Safeco Field has been called T-Mobile Park since 2019 while the hockey arena in Las Vegas that hosts the NHL team Vegas Golden Knights is called T-Mobile Arena. And the sports arena in Kansas City formerly called the Sprint Center is now the T-Mobile Center following the Sprint/T-Mobile merger although that arena does not host any major league sports franchises.

The Yankees with a record of 73-45 are currently in first place in the American League East by ten games including a 42-17 record at home. However they have only won three of their last ten games and now have only the second-best record in the American League after the Houston Astros. They also have three fewer wins than their crosstown counterparts the New York Mets who are 76-42.

While most of Wall Street focuses on large-cap and mega-cap stocks as they provide a degree of safety and liquidity many investors are limited in the number of shares they can buy. Many of the biggest public companies especially the technology giants trade in the hundreds all the way up to over $1000 per share or more. At those steep prices it is difficult to get any decent share count leverage.

Many investors especially more aggressive traders look at lower-priced stocks as a way not only to make some good money but to get a higher share count. That can really help the decision-making process especially when you are on to a winner as you can always sell half and keep half.

[in-text-ad]

We screened our 24/7 Wall St. research database looking for well-known companies that could very well offer patient investors some huge returns for the rest of 2022 and beyond. Skeptics of low-priced shares should remember that at one point both Amazon and Apple traded in the single digits. One stock we featured over the years Zynga recently was purchased by Take-Two Interactive. Cogent Biosciences which we featured in March has doubled.

While all five of these stocks are rated Buy it is important to remember that no single analyst report should be used as a sole basis for any buying or selling decision.

Earlier this week a surprising Amazon listing provided fresh details on New Tales from the Borderlands the Gearbox-developed follow-up to Telltale Games' 2014 episodic adventure of almost the same name. Though not formally announced the listing suggests it'll launch for Xbox One Xbox Series X/S PlayStation 4 PS5 Switch and PC on 21st October.

As Matt summarised for us at the time original developer Telltale shut its doors in 2018 - and given the relative commercial failure of the original game - it seemed like a sequel might never come to pass. However Borderlands developer Gearbox surprised everyone back in April when it announced that a follow-up wasn't just in the works but would be out by the end of the year.

But the worst may be over,"New York CNN Business —

Target just demonstrated how quickly things can change in the world of retail posting a terrible quarter after nearly two years of soaring profits and record revenue growth. But the big box retailer is promising things will change in the other direction just as fast.

Target was widely seen as one of the winners of the pandemic gaining new customers as shoppers not wanting to go into brick-and-mortar stores were drawn to its growing curbside pickup and home delivery.

But after a disappointing fiscal first quarter when profits fell 40% Target just had an even worse second quarter. Profits plunged 90% compared to a year earlier.

Inflation-weary shoppers shifted to buying essentials such as food and gas rather than “nonessential” general merchandise that is central to Target’s sales and profits. It was a stark contrast to larger rival Walmart (WMT) which posted only a narrow drop in profits for the quarter.

But many analysts believe Target is still in good position going forward that it’s not at risk of joining some of the other pandemic winners who are now struggling like online retailer Wayfair (W). Friday it announced it had to cut 5% of the staff due to expanding too fast during the good times.

Target’s profit plunge came from the deep discounts it had to offer on much of its general merchandise such as clothing electronics and home goods. The hit to earnings from such deep discounting was unavoidable. But company executives insist it was the right choice.

“Consider the alternative: we could have held on to excess inventory and attempted to deal with it slowly over multiple quarters or even years. While that might have reduced the near-term financial impact it would have held back our business over time” said CEO Brian Cornell to investors. “The vast majority of the financial impact of these inventory actions is now behind us.” He predicts a meaningful improvement in operating margin rates in the fall season.

Many analysts agree that Target did the right thing taking the hit. Several say the sudden shift in consumer buying habits was not the fault of miscalculation by management.

“All last year the supply chain was very very tight. Stores were out of stock of many items. They were ordering for a level of demand that was very reasonable” said Bobby Griffin retail analyst at Raymond James. “Then there was a very fast change in consumer behavior.”

Discretionary purchases being made by consumers shifted away from goods to things like travel Griffin said.

Other experts say that Target management wasn’t quite blameless for being caught with too much of the wrong inventory.

“My sense is that this [problem at Target] was 70% about consumer behavior and 30% miscalculation related to inventory” said Eric Schiffer chief investment officer of Los Angeles-based private equity firm The Patriarch Organization.

There is some hope for all retailers that they could benefit from the large steady decline in gas prices over the last two months.

The national average price of gasoline has dropped $1.11 or 22% to $3.91 since hitting a record of $5.02 on June 14. It has fallen every day since. That should save households $100 a month on average. And wholesale gasoline futures point to even lower gas prices ahead in the coming weeks and months.

Target was always going to have more problems with a sudden shift in consumer spending than Walmart. Walmart has more than half of its sales from grocery while Target is closer to 20% said Owen Chen retail analyst at Cowen. Walmart also had to offer sales on its nonessential general merchandise in the quarter.

And Walmart has always competed more on low prices an advantage at a time that even middle and higher income shoppers are concerned about higher prices. Walmart executives reported it saw more business from those upper income households in the most recent quarter a statement that cheered its investors.

But Chen said the numbers indicate that they did not get those higher income shoppers from Target’s traditional customers.

“I think that Target’s [store] traffic numbers show it did a good job holding onto their customers” he said. The number of customers making purchases at Target was up 2.7% compared to a year ago in the just-completed quarter. And that’s more than a 20% increase since the same period of 2019 ahead of the pandemic.

Target shares have underperformed some of its rivals falling 28% so far this year compared to only a 5% decline at Walmart. Schiffer said he wouldn’t be surprised to see the slide in Target shares continue as he believes they are overvalued by as much as 30%. But he doesn’t think that means Target is badly positioned for the future.

“I would stay the course” he said. “The pace of growth during the pandemic was never going to be sustainable. They’ll still grow just not as fast.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL2Nic2F1c3Rpbi5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXRpb24td29ybGQvcHJhbmtzdGVycy1wdXQtdXAtZmFrZS1zaWduLW9mLWEtdGFyZ2V0LWNvbWluZy1zb29uLWluLXNtYWxsLXRvd24tbG9jYWwtc2FuLWFudG9uaW8tdGV4YXPSAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly9jYnNhdXN0aW4uY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL25hdGlvbi13b3JsZC9wcmFua3N0ZXJzLXB1dC11cC1mYWtlLXNpZ24tb2YtYS10YXJnZXQtY29taW5nLXNvb24taW4tc21hbGwtdG93bi1sb2NhbC1zYW4tYW50b25pby10ZXhhcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pranksters put up fake sign of a Target 'coming soon' in small town,"What appeared to be a big announcement about a new Target store going up in Marshalltown Iowa stirred up a lot of buzz this week. It was exciting news for a small town where the nearest Target is about 45 minutes away. The only problem was the sign was a prank!

If the prank revealed anything it's that a whole lot of people here in Marshalltown would love having a Target. To get to the nearest Target it's a 36-mile drive on Duff Avenue in Ames.

This is the sign that played with people's hearts and stirred up the small talk and this is the sign that broke those hearts.

The coming soon promise was only a prank.



""I think a lot of people would think it's super mean. Cuz I know a lot of people would love to have a target here. I know a lot of people would think it's very funny because they know for a fact there's no way on earth that there'd be a target here in Marshalltown"" said Aryana Ordaz.

That sentiment seems to be shared around town. It'd be nice but it just didn't seem believable.

""For a target to pop up right here on 3rd avenue would be kind of woohoo nah not gonna happen"" said Julie Johnson. ""Oh my god I would love for a Target to be across the street. I would love it.""

Unity point sent us a statement saying in part that this was someone's ""light-hearted prank and the covering has been removed. We can confirm that we haven't had any discussions with Target corporation about a new store location and our property remains for sale.""

That means Target still requires a trip.



""There were several people with their hopes up to have a Target here"" said Rochelle Thomas. She tells the prankster ""You're not very nice. You wasted a lot of people's time and dreams.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3MS5yZXRhaWx0b3VjaHBvaW50cy5jb20vYS8yMDIyLWRlc2lnbnJldGFpbC00MC11bmRlci00MC1hd2FyZHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2022 design:retail 40 Under 40 Awards,Retail TouchPoints and design:retail give all members of the retail world access to a vibrant community that combines insights inspiration and opportunities to interact with their peers.

But which publicly traded companies are leading the way in terms of innovation and potential? Check out our list of the best hearing aid stocks to kick-start your research.

Best Hearing Aid Stocks To Buy

Intricon Corporation (NASDAQ: IIN)

Intricon produces a range of micro-sized medical devices including hearing aids.

The company’s United States headquarters is in Michigan but it also has locations in Singapore Indonesia London and Germany.

Intricon makes seven different types of hearing aids as well as the accessories that go with them.

Its devices are small comfortable and discreet. The company also makes eight different kinds of amplifiers.

Intricon struggled during the pandemic with its stock price dipping down to around $10 per share at its lowest point. This stock has rebounded since.

In addition to hearing aids Intricon also makes a huge variety of other medical devices. These include catheters cardiac monitors and more.

Knowles Corporation (NYSE: KN)

The Knowles Corporation is a company that makes electronic components that are used in hearing devices.

Its products include microphones receivers and programming components for hearing aids.

Outside the hearing aid market the company makes products for mobile devices traditional headphones IoT devices and more.

Knowles Corporation is one of the important players in the hearing aid market as many other companies rely on its parts.

However its involvement in other industries gives it a more diverse stream of income.

Hearing Aid Penny Stocks

Eargo (NASDAQ: EAR)

Eargo is a hearing aid manufacturer based in San Jose California.

The company’s stock charts tell an interesting story.

Ergo went public in October 2020 opening at about ~$30. It reached all-time highs of around $70 per share. Unfortunately after the 2021 market downturn this stock took a tumble.

It’s been in the penny stock range since about September 2021.

Eargo does have a lot going for it that could help the company regain some of its lost momentum.

Its devices use a very innovative design that is inspired by a fishing fly. This has allowed it to produce virtually invisible hearing aids.

These hearing aids have several features that make them very comfortable. They also provide very crisp sound quality.

Eargo’s hearing aids are fully rechargeable and come with a portable charging device.

The company even offers a custom calibration option.

Its devices are also very sleek which has made them very popular among children and young adults who need hearing support.

There’s still plenty of potential for this hearing aid stock to grow so now might be a good time to add it to your portfolio.

Innerscope Hearing Technologies (OTC: INND)

Innerscope Hearing Technologies is a hearing aid penny stock for investors who are willing to take a risk.

This company is working with audiologists and other hearing experts to provide direct-to-consumer hearing devices.

The company is working with Walmart and other large retailers.

But how is this possible?

Recent legislation allows customers to buy hearing aids without a prescription from their doctor.

This has made it much easier for people with moderate hearing loss to get the care they need with prescription hearing aids. It also allows Innerscope Hearing Technologies to tap into a broader range of consumers.

Over the next few years we could expect to see the hearing aid market grow as a result — especially since access is broadening.

All in all Innerscope Hearing Technologies stock provides the opportunity to invest in a growing company that has a lot to offer in the hearing market.

Hearing Aid Stocks That Pay Dividends

Sonova (OTC: SONVY)

Sonova is a Swiss company that makes a variety of devices for those with hearing loss.

These include hearing aids as well as cochlear implants and wireless devices.

This hearing aid manufacturer markets its products under five different brands both in the U.S. and around the world.

It has a huge market share in this industry.

Sonova stock has performed very well this past year.

While its shares initially dropped during the March 2020 stock market crash they had recovered by September.

This company doesn’t pay a huge dividend but it can still be a good source of long-term income.

Since Sonova is such a respected name in the hearing aid market it could be a great buy for portfolio stability.

There is consistent demand for its products which is reflected in the company’s financials. This is why Sonova is on our list of the top hearing aid stocks.

Energizer Holdings (NYSE: ENR)

Energizer Holdings is one of the largest battery manufacturers in the world.

The company makes batteries for a variety of products and has several subsidiaries.

One of these subsidiaries is Rayovac which makes hearing aid batteries.

In fact it is the world’s largest manufacturer of hearing aid batteries and they make a huge range of sizes to fit different models.

Over the years Rayovac has improved the quality of its batteries so they are more compact and provide better sound quality.

It was a part of Spectrum Brands until 2019 when the company sold it to Energizer.

Energizer stock has been up and down over the past several years.

However they have recovered well from the Coronavirus pandemic and the resulting stock market crash.

Since batteries are an important consumer staple it’s likely that this stock will be able to weather through tough economic times.

These factors could make it a great stock to buy and hold for the long run.

Should You Buy Hearing Aid Stocks?

Hearing aid stocks access a unique vantage point in the medical device and healthcare markets.

The World Health Organization estimates that approximately 466 million people around the world struggle with some form of disabling hearing impairment or loss.

There’s also a huge percentage of the population who could benefit from using hearing aids but don’t currently use one.

This means the hearing aid industry is full of untapped potential.

Companies in this industry can expand into new locations and use new marketing strategies to ensure they’re reaching the right target audience.

Recently in the US it’s become much easier for people to access the hearing aid technology they need.

In 2020 Congress passed legislation that allows people with mild hearing loss to purchase hearing devices over the counter.

Before patients with hearing loss would need to see a doctor to obtain the hearing aids they needed.

This presents a huge opportunity for companies that can sell over-the-counter products like some of the companies we mentioned.

Final Thoughts

Since hearing devices are essential for so many people it makes sense to invest in the companies that make them.

Hearing aid stocks are a great investment opportunity even during challenging economic times.

Today space system designers and developers are truly embracing the SpaceVPX (VITA 78) standard which leverages the OpenVPX (VITA 65.0) architecture through its slot profile and module profile level building blocks which create interconnect solutions based on the user’s need.

Explore the basics of SpaceVPX with the designers of the VPX and SpaceVPX interconnect. Learn about the standard’s origin the advantages of SpaceVPX vs. OpenVPX recent changes to the standard and the importance of standard interconnects which drive down cost results in a more robust supply chain and maintains a path for future expansion.

What is SpaceVPX?

SpaceVPX is a standard for creating plug-in cards (PICs) from its slot profile and module (protocol) profiles. In turn these building blocks create interconnected subsystems and systems. Developed under the auspices of The Next Generation Space Interconnect Standard (NGSIS) it is the result of a government-Industry collaboration. The primary goal of SpaceVPX is to cost-effectively remove bandwidth as a constraint for future space systems.

SpaceVPX is based on the VITA (VMEbus International Trade Association) OpenVPX standard with enhancements that extend the standard for space applications.

The NGSIS team selected the OpenVPX standard family as the physical baseline for the new SpaceVPX standard because VPX supports both 3U and 6U form factors with ruggedized and conduction-cooled features suitable for use in extreme environments. The infrastructure of OpenVPX also allows for prototyping and testing SpaceVPX on the ground.

SpaceVPX is built upon several standards some of which are part of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)/VITA and European Cooperation for Space Standardization (ECSS) OpenVPX family:

VITA 46 VPX and its ANSI/VITA 65.0 OpenVPX derivative – baseline standard

ANSI/VITA 60 and ANSI/VITA 63 – compatible connectors

ANSI/VITA 48.2[3] – mechanical extensions

ANSI/VITA 62 – standardized power module

ANSI/VITA 66 and 67 – replacement of electrical segments with RF or optical solutions

ANSI/VITA 46.11[4] – management protocol the basis for fault-tolerant management of the SpaceVPX system

ECSS – SpaceWire standard

ECSS – Remote Memory Access Protocol (RMAP)

ECSS – SpaceFibre standard

Gigabit Ethernet

What is OpenVPX?

OpenVPX is a defined set of system implementations within VPX that specifies a set of system architectures. OpenVPX organizes connections in four major interconnect planes — data control utility and expansion.

Data Plane

The data plane incorporates high-speed multigigabit fabric connections between modules to carry payload and mission data.

Control Plane

The control plane also a fabric connection typically has less capacity and is used for configuration setup diagnostics and other operational control functions within the payload and for lower-speed data transfers.

Utility Plane

The utility plane provides setup and control of basic module functions for power sequencing low-level diagnostics clocks and other base signals needed for system operation.

Expansion Plane

The expansion plane may be used as a separate connection between modules using similar interfaces or to bridge heritage interfaces in a more limited topology such as a bus or ring.

Pins not defined as part of any of these planes are typically user-defined and are available for pass-through from daughter or mezzanine cards or to rear transition modules (RTM). For maximum module reuse the user-defined pins should be configurable so as not to interfere with modules that use the same pins in a different way. Consult ANSI/VITA 65.0 for more detail.

The Limitations of OpenVPX for Space Applications

An evaluation of OpenVPX for space usage revealed several shortcomings. The key limitation was the lack of features available to support a full single-fault-tolerant highly reliable configuration. Utility signals were bused and in most cases supported only one set of signals via signal pins to a module. As a result a pure OpenVPX system has opportunities for multiple failures. Additionally a full management-control mechanism was not fully defined with VITA 46.11.

From a protocol perspective SpaceWire is the dominant medium-speed data and control plane interface for most spacecraft yet the typical OpenVPX control planes are peripheral component interconnect express (PCIe) or Ethernet which are not generally used in space applications. (Note: Gigabit Ethernet was added to the 2022 revision of the SpaceVPX standard.)

SpaceVPX Mission: Fault Tolerance

The goal of SpaceVPX is to achieve an acceptable level of fault tolerance while maintaining a reasonable level of compatibility with existing OpenVPX components including connector-pin assignments for the board and the backplane (Figure 1.).

Figure 1 | The goal of SpaceVPX is to achieve an acceptable level of fault tolerance by way of redundancy and switching. Illustration: VITA.

For the purposes of fault tolerance a module (defined as a printed wire assembly which conforms to defined mechanical and electrical specifications) is considered the minimum redundancy element or the minimum fault containment region. The utility plane and control plane within SpaceVPX are all distributed redundantly and are arranged in star topologies dual-star topologies partial-mesh topologies or full-mesh topologies to provide fault tolerance to the entire system.

To meet the desired level of fault tolerance the utility plane signals must be dual-redundant and switched to each SpaceVPX card function.

A trade study conducted in 2010 through a government and industry collaboration with the support of the SpaceVPX Working Group compared various implementations including adding the switching to each card in various ways and creating a unique switching card. The latter approach was selected so SpaceVPX cards can each receive the same utility plane signals that an OpenVPX card receives with minor adjustments for any changes in topology. This became known as the Space Utility Management module (SpaceUM) a major foundation of the SpaceVPX standard.

A 6U SpaceUM module contains up to eight sets of power and signal switches to support eight SpaceVPX payload modules — the 3U version of the SpaceUM can support up to five. It receives one power bus from each of two power supplies and one set of utility plane signals from each of two system controller functions required in the SpaceVPX backplane. The various parts of the SpaceUM module do not require their own redundancy. They are considered extensions of the power supply system controller and other SpaceVPX modules for reliability calculation.

Profiles for Space Defined

Each slot module and backplane profile in OpenVPX is fully defined and interlinked. Adapting these profiles for use in space requires specification of a SpaceVPX version of each profile.

Slot Profile A slot profile provides a physical mapping of data ports onto a slot’s backplane connector which is agnostic to the type of protocol used to convey data from the slot to the backplane.

Module and Backplane Profiles

Module profiles are extensions of their accompanying slot profiles which enable mapping of protocols to each module port. A module profile includes information on thermal power and mechanical requirements for each module. Some module profiles for SpaceVPX are similar to OpenVPX which enables use of OpenVPX modules and backplanes for prototyping or testing on the ground. However most module profiles for space applications are significantly different from profiles for ground applications so full specifications consistent with SpaceVPX are required. The section of the SpaceVPX standard that defines these profiles forms a majority of the standard.

Standardized SpaceVPX Interconnects

Interconnects are one more critical part of SpaceVPX. As with other elements of the standard they are based on interconnects developed for OpenVPX but designed for the extreme space environment.

Problematic temperatures vibration outgassing and other factors can catastrophically compromise interconnect systems as well as signal and power integrity. For decades designers for space applications have relied on customized interconnect designs to ensure the reliability of embedded electronics exposed to the extremes of space. The high cost and long lead times of a custom interconnect solution were once considered a worthwhile investment against failures that are extremely costly or impossible to fix in space.

Today the use of standard interconnects drives down cost improves availability and maintains a path for future expansion.

By leveraging the OpenVPX architecture SpaceVPX brings in the interconnect solutions which are defined in VITA standards and have gone through extensive testing to support their use in space.

The SpaceVPX slot profiles define the use of VPX connectors (VITA 46 or alternate VPX connectors) and enable implementation of RF (VITA 67) and optical (VITA 66) modules at the plug-in module to backplane interface. Power supplies follow the VITA 62 standard which also defines the power supply connector interface. For XMC mezzanine cards in plug-in modules XMC 2.0 connectors per VITA 61 are recommended. Rather than defining new connectors with special characteristics SpaceVPX slot profiles reference the appropriate VITA connector standards that support the OpenVPX architecture.

VITA 46 VPX Connectors

The VITA 46 VPX connector is the original VPX interconnect. It is based on TE Connectivity’s (TE) MULTIGIG RT 2 connector which was released in the VITA 46 standard in 2006.

The MULTIGIG RT connector family gives designers an easy-to-implement modular standardized and cost-effective interconnect system that helps ensure the reliability of their embedded-computing applications for space systems.

MULTIGIG RT connectors have gone through extensive testing by TE to establish suitability for space including:

Compliant (press-fit) pin technology

Testing has been performed at min-max board hole sizes and different printed circuit board (PCB) platings to verify the reliability of the compliant pin designs. Today numerous space applications use compliant pin technology (as compared to traditional soldered connections) and implementation is increasing.

The VITA 72 study group was formed to address extreme vibration applications. The group devised a vibration test that subjected a 6U VPX test unit to random vibration levels of 0.2 g2/Hz for 12 hours a severe requirement compared to the original VPX standard. TE’s MULTIGIG RT 2-R connector — featuring an enhanced quad-redundant backplane connector contact system and rugged guide hardware — tested successfully as part of this effort and has been used in highly rugged applications since 2013.

Extreme temperature

MULTIGIG connectors were subjected to a temperature range of -55 ˚C to +105 ˚C when initially qualified for VPX in 2006 which met the VITA 47 standard for plug-in modules. In direct response to requirements from space-systems developers MULTIGIG RT connectors have since been tested and survived -55 °C to +125 °C including exposure to 1000 hours of heat at 125 °C and 100 thermal shock cycles from -55 °C to +125 °C.

Outgassing

Unlike heavy polymer plug-in module connectors used in conventional backplane connector designs MULTIGIG RT connectors incorporate air gaps so less polymer is required. The polymer reduction reduces weight and decreases outgassing. With MULTIGIG RT connector materials total mass loss (TML) is less than 1% and collected volatile condensable materials (CVCM) is less than 0.01% which meets NASA and European Space Agency (ESA) outgassing requirements.

Current capacity

When VITA 78 was developed there was a need for VPX connectors to support new pinouts (not defined in VITA 46) to support the requirements for redundant power distribution and redundant management distribution. TE completed extensive testing for current carrying capability on multiple adjacent MULTIGIG power wafers within plug-in module connectors and also released new wafer configurations to support the VITA 78 Space Utility Management module architecture.

Most space system designers use MULTIGIG RT connectors to meet their requirements with no physical change to the design or materials and finishes. If minimal changes are required (e.g. higher lead content [40%] in the contact tails is specified for increased tin-whisker mitigation) additional screening tests are required based on the user or program requirements but the connector-manufacturing processes are relatively the same which helps improve cost and availability.

RF and Optical Modules

RF and optical connector modules can be integrated within an OpenVPX slot to carry signals through the backplane to/from the plug-in module. These connector modules are mounted to the boards (including standard aperture cutouts on the backplane) to house multiple coaxial contacts or optical fibers. They can replace select VITA 46 connectors within a slot. These RF and optical connector modules and contacts have been used in satellite systems and are suitable for other applications in space.

VITA 67 is the base standard for RF modules. VITA 67.3 is used for SpaceVPX architecture with apertures defined within specific slot profiles for RF and optical connector modules. VITA 67.3 offers coaxial contact solutions with the initial sub-miniature push-on micro (SMPM) contacts as well as higher-density coaxial interfaces NanoRF and switched-mode power supply (SMPS) which can increase the contact density two to three times over SMPM. A new revision to VITA 67.3 has begun to add 75 Ohm coaxial interfaces to support higher speed video.

VITA 66 is the base standard for optical modules with MT ferrules as the primary optical interface between the plug-in module and backplane. The apertures in SpaceVPX slot profiles accommodate optical and hybrid RF/optical connector modules meeting the requirements of VITA 66.5. MT interfaces can be specified for 12 or 24 fibers for highest density.

XMC Connectors

XMC mezzanine cards can be implemented on SpaceVPX plug-in modules to add I/O and other features. VITA 61 XMC 2.0 the standard based on TE’s Mezalok connector is the recommended XMC connector in the SpaceVPX standard. The Mezalok connector features multiple points of contact per pin supporting the redundancy required for space applications. The connector meets outgassing requirements and has been tested to extreme environments — including 2000 thermal cycles from -55 ºC to +125 ºC with no solder joint failures.

The Future of SpaceVPX Interconnects

By leveraging the OpenVPX architecture SpaceVPX can also leverage the OpenVPX interconnect roadmap which addresses solutions having faster speeds higher density smaller size and lighter weight. There is significant activity with new and revised VITA standards to define technologies supporting next-generation embedded computing.

Higher data rate MULTIGIG RT 3 connectors are available and standardized in VITA 46.30 (compliant pin) and 46.31 (solder tail) to support channels to 25-32 Gigabits per second supporting 100G Ethernet and PCI Gen 4 and 5. These can be incorporated in a SpaceVPX slot replacing VITA 46.0 connectors.

The latest revision of the VITA 67.3 standard includes higher-density RF interfaces NanoRF and SMPS reducing size and weight — both of which are critical for space systems — and accommodating higher frequencies to 70 GHz. A new revision to VITA 67.3 has begun to add 75 Ohm coaxial interfaces within a connector module to support higher speed video protocols.

The VITA 66.5 standard will be released in 2022 documenting higher-density optical interfaces bringing up to three MT interfaces into a half-module and enabling integration of a fixed edge-mount transceiver. In addition VITA 66.5 provides solutions with NanoRF contacts and optical MTs integrated into a common connector module providing unprecedented density within an OpenVPX slot.

New VITA 62 power supply standards have addressed three-phase power (VITA 62.1) and higher 270VDC input voltages (VITA 62.2). New MULTIBEAM XLE connectors from TE with isolating fins provide this upgrade for higher voltage levels while maintaining the same VITA 62.0 interface.

Carmine Cupani wanted to set the record straight. So he asked his young son to stand in the path of his Tesla as it sped through a parking lot.

The North Carolina resident set out to refute a widely circulated video of a Tesla with the company’s “full self-driving” beta software – which allows the car to steer brake and accelerate but requires an attentive human driver ready to take the wheel – plowing into child-size mannequins.

Dan O’Dowd a software company CEO who published the video earlier this month thinks the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration should ban “full self-driving” until Tesla CEO Elon Musk “proves it won’t mow down children.”

That’s when Cupani who runs an auto shop focused on imports and Teslas got involved and recruited his son. While he’s a self-described “BMW guy” Cupani says the software can’t compare to what Tesla offers. It also wasn’t the first time he’d enlisted his son who Cupani said is 11 years old in a potentially viral car endeavor: Earlier this year he posted a video of his son driving his Model S Plaid — which can reach 0-60 in 1.99 seconds — in a private parking lot. It’s been viewed more than 250000 times.

“Some people look at it and say ‘Oh this crazy dad what is he doing?’” Cupani told CNN Business. “Well I do a lot of stuff like that but I’m going to make sure my kid doesn’t get hit.”

Cupani filmed the test of “full self-driving” in a parking lot. His son stood near the end of an aisle holding a smartphone to film the test. Cupani accelerated the Tesla from the other side of the lot and turned on “full self-driving” reaching 35 mph. The Tesla braked steadily and came to a full stop – well ahead of his son.

Cupani did another test with his son on a street using Autopilot the more rudimentary Tesla driver-assist software and found it stopped for his son too. “This Dan guy he says he’s an expert in this expert in that” Cupani said. “Well I’m an expert in automotive future technology pro driving instructor.”

Cupani is among the many Tesla supporters who took issue with O’Dowd’s video and set out to create their own tests. Some asked their children to help. Others built homemade mannequins or used blow-up dolls.

The passionate defenses and criticism of “full self-driving” highlight how the technology has become a flashpoint in the industry. The California DMV recently said the name “full self-driving” is deceptive and grounds for suspending or revoking Tesla’s license to sell vehicles in the state. Ralph Nader whose 1960s criticism of the auto industry helped spark the creation of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) joined a chorus of critics of “full self-driving” this month.

But it also is yet another example of the unintended consequence of deploying an unfinished disruptive technology in the wild – and shows how far some Tesla believers are willing to go to defend it and the company. Enough people appeared to be pursuing their own experiments that one government agency took the extraordinary step of warning people not to use children to test a car’s technology.

“Consumers should never attempt to create their own test scenarios or use real people and especially children to test the performance of vehicle technology” NHTSA said in a statement Wednesday. The agency called this approach “highly dangerous.”

Testing Teslas

Earlier this month California resident Tad Park saw that another Tesla enthusiast wanted to test “full self-driving” with a child and volunteered two of his children. Park told CNN Business it was a “little tough” to get his wife to agree. She agreed when he promised to drive the vehicle.

“I’m never going to push the limits because my kids are way more valuable to me than anything” Park said. “I’m not going to risk their lives in any way.”

Park’s tests unlike O’Dowd’s started with the Tesla at 0 mph. The Tesla stopped in all of Park’s tests ahead of two of his children involved in the video including a 5-year-old. Park said he wasn’t comfortable doing a higher speed test of 40 mph – like O’Dowd performed using the mannequins – with his kids.

Toronto resident Franklin Cadamuro created a “box boy” a childlike form crafted from old Amazon cardboard boxes. “Do not blame me for what the car does or doesn’t do” he posted at the beginning of his video. “I am a big Tesla Fan.”

His Tesla slowed as it approached “box boy.” Then it sped up again and struck his cardboard mannequin. Cadamuro speculated that this could be because the cameras could not see the short boxes once they were immediately in front of the bumper and therefore forget they were there.

Human babies learn at about eight months that an object out of sight still exists many years before qualifying for a driver’s license. But the ability may still elude some artificial intelligence systems like Tesla’s “full self-driving.” Another Tesla fan found a similar result.

Cadamuro said his video started as entertainment. But he wanted people to see that “full self-driving” isn’t perfect.

“I find a lot of people have two extreme thoughts of the ‘full self-driving’ beta” Cadamuro said. “People like Dan think it’s the worst thing in the world. I know some friends who think it’s near perfect.”

Cadamuro said he also performed other tests in which his Tesla traveling at higher speeds effectively steered around “box boy.”

Detecting smaller objects like young children quickly and accurately will generally be more difficult than sensing large objects and adults for a computer vision system like what Tesla vehicles rely on according to Raj Rajkumar a Carnegie Mellon University professor who researches autonomous vehicles.

The more pixels an object takes up in a camera image the more information the system has to detect features and identify the object. The system will also be impacted by the data it is trained on such as how many images of small children it’s exposed to.

“Computer vision with machine learning is not 100% foolproof” Rajkumar said. “Just like diagnosis of a disease there are always false positives and negatives.”

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment and generally does not engage with the professional news media.

“Wild West chaos rules”

Following criticism from Tesla fans of his original tests O’Dowd released another video this month.

Some Tesla supporters had criticized O’Dowd’s use of cones as lane markings in his original testing which may have limited the sedan’s ability to steer around the mannequin. Others claimed that O’Dowd’s test driver had forced the Tesla to strike the mannequin by pushing the accelerator which wasn’t visible in videos O’Dowd released. Some Tesla enthusiasts also pointed to a blurry messages on the screen of the Tesla vehicle as an indication that O’Dowd’s test driver was pushing the accelerator to rig the tests.

O’Dowd told CNN Business that the blurry messages referred to supercharging being unavailable and to uneven tire wear. CNN Business could not independently verify what the message said as O’Dowd provided no crisper video of what happened in car during the tests.

In his second video O’Dowd’s tested without cones on a residential street and showed the interior of the Tesla including the accelerator pedal. The Tesla as in O’Dowd’s other tests struck the child mannequin.

Everything is real except the child bc you know what would happen to a real child! pic.twitter.com/a3ut9bpSqG — Dan O'Dowd (@RealDanODowd) August 15 2022

O’Dowd lamented earlier this year in an interview with CNN Business that no industry testing body examines the code for “full self-driving.” The US government has no performance standards for automated driver-assist technology like Autopilot.

O’Dowd is the founder of the Dawn Project an effort to make computers safe for humanity. He ran as a candidate for the US Senate unsuccessfully this year in a campaign focused exclusively on his critique of “full self-driving.”

NHTSA is currently investigating Tesla’s driver-assist technology so changes may be ahead.

“The software that controls billions of people’s lives in self-driving cars should be the best software ever written” O’Dowd said. “We’re using absolute Wild West chaos rules and we’ve gotten something that is so terrible.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvcnF1ZW5ld3MuY29tLzE0MzM1L215LWZpcnN0LWV4cGVyaWVuY2UtbXktbmV3LXRlc2xhLW1vZGVsLTPSAU1odHRwczovL3d3dy50b3JxdWVuZXdzLmNvbS8xNDMzNS9teS1maXJzdC1leHBlcmllbmNlLW15LW5ldy10ZXNsYS1tb2RlbC0zL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,My First Experience With My New Tesla Model 3,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvcnF1ZW5ld3MuY29tLzE0MzM1L215LWZpcnN0LWV4cGVyaWVuY2UtbXktbmV3LXRlc2xhLW1vZGVsLTPSAU1odHRwczovL3d3dy50b3JxdWVuZXdzLmNvbS8xNDMzNS9teS1maXJzdC1leHBlcmllbmNlLW15LW5ldy10ZXNsYS1tb2RlbC0zL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159B9B6B970>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvcnF1ZW5ld3MuY29tLzE0MzM1L215LWZpcnN0LWV4cGVyaWVuY2UtbXktbmV3LXRlc2xhLW1vZGVsLTPSAU1odHRwczovL3d3dy50b3JxdWVuZXdzLmNvbS8xNDMzNS9teS1maXJzdC1leHBlcmllbmNlLW15LW5ldy10ZXNsYS1tb2RlbC0zL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzgvMjEvMjMzMTUyNzAvdGVzbGEtZnVsbC1zZWxmLWRyaXZpbmctZnNkLWZlYXR1cmUtcHJpY2UtaW5jcmVhc2UtZWxlY3RyaWMtdmVoaWNsZS1lbG9uLW11c2vSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elon Musk’s raising the cost of Tesla’s Full Self-Driving software to $15k,"Tesla’s increasing the price of its Full-Self Driving (FSD) software to $15000. In a post on Twitter Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that the new price will go into effect in North America starting September 5th representing a $3000 jump.

Drivers who order a vehicle before September 5th won’t have to pay the newly-increased price Musk says. The price hike comes as Tesla begins rolling out FSD beta 10.69 to drivers a version Musk calls “a big step forward.” It’s still unclear whether Tesla plans on raising the price of its FSD subscription which currently costs $199 per month.

The FSD software lets drivers use Tesla’s advanced driving assistance system (ADAS) Autopilot to navigate to and from specific destinations among other driver-assist features. FSD doesn’t make a vehicle fully autonomous; it requires drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and pay attention to the road at all times.

In 2019 Musk called Tesla vehicles “appreciating assets” meaning that they’ll increase in value as Tesla launches additional driver-assist features. Musk later claimed that “the value of FSD” could reach over $100000 “as the software gets closer to full self-driving capability with regulatory approval.”

Earlier this month California’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) accused Tesla of making “untrue or misleading claims” about its vehicles’ self-driving capabilities. The DMV alleges that the names Autopilot and FSD as well as the language Tesla uses to describe them could deceive users into thinking that the vehicles can operate autonomously.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMjEvZWxvbi1tdXNrLXNheXMtdGVzbGEtd2lsbC1yYWlzZS1wcmljZS1vZi1mc2QtYnktMjVwZXJjZW50LWluLXNlcHRlbWJlci5odG1s0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjIvMDgvMjEvZWxvbi1tdXNrLXNheXMtdGVzbGEtd2lsbC1yYWlzZS1wcmljZS1vZi1mc2QtYnktMjVwZXJjZW50LWluLXNlcHRlbWJlci5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elon Musk says Tesla will hike the price of FSD driver assistance software by 25% in September,"Tesla founder Elon Musk was practically apologetic on his company's earnings call for hiking prices to meet higher costs.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Sunday announced a 25% price increase for the company's premium driver assistance system which is marketed under the name Full Self-Driving or FSD. The price will increase to $15000 from $12000 on Sept. 5 Musk said in a tweet.

Today Tesla charges customers $12000 upfront for FSD or $199 per month on a subscription basis.

Musk did not immediately mention an increase in the cost of FSD subscriptions and Tesla did not respond to a request for further information.

All new Tesla vehicles come with a standard driver assistance package called Autopilot which includes features like ""Traffic-Aware Cruise Control"" and ""Autosteer."" These rely on cameras other sensors hardware and software to automatically keep a Tesla vehicle centered in its lane and traveling at the speed of surrounding traffic.

Tesla's highest-priced driver assistance option FSD includes what the company calls ""Traffic and Stop Sign Control"" and ""Navigate on Autopilot"" among its features.

These more advanced features are intended to let Tesla cars automatically detect and slow down for traffic signs and signals; navigate from highway on-ramp to off-ramp while engaging turn signals; make lane changes and take exits.

Tesla tells drivers to remain attentive and be prepared to take over their cars' steering and braking at any time while using Autopilot or FSD. Its technology does not make Tesla vehicles autonomous.

One Tesla feature called Smart Summon allows drivers to use a smartphone and Tesla mobile app like a remote control to call their car from across a parking lot and slowly drive without anyone behind the wheel to where they are standing.

While some FSD features are also included in a lower-priced option called Enhanced Autopilot or EAP only Tesla customers who buy or subscribe to the premium option can request access to FSD Beta an experimental version of Tesla's system.

FSD Beta users are supposed to obtain a high ""Safety Score"" from Tesla to get and maintain access to the system.

Tesla's approach has drawn criticism and regulatory scrutiny from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the California Department of Motor Vehicles alike.

Still the company is forging ahead and doing a limited release of the latest version of FSD Beta to a relatively small pool of users Musk also tweeted on Sunday.

Earlier he wrote on Twitter ""There are many major code changes so this will be an extra cautious rollout. Releasing on 8/20 to ~1000 Tesla owners then 10.69.1 next week to accommodate feedback & release to ~10k customers then 10.69.2 week after & release to rest of FSD Beta.""

Owners who gain access to FSD Beta are able to send feedback to the company via their cars when the system fails or acts glitchy. Tesla previously said 100000 drivers had already installed FSD Beta.

Tesla is planning to make FSD Beta even more mainstream.

At the Tesla 2022 Annual Shareholder Meeting on August 4 Musk said that FSD Beta will be available to anyone who requests it by the end of this year. Here's a quote from Thomson Financial's transcript of the meeting:

""We're still tracking very much to have widespread deployment of FSD Beta this year in North America. So I should say basically FSD will be available to anyone who requests it by the end of this year.""

Among those who are receiving the limited-release update this weekend are widely followed social media influencers who sell Tesla merchandise and run ad-supported videos on YouTube channels where they review Tesla's latest releases and more.

Since 2016 the NHTSA has opened 38 probes into collisions that involved a Tesla vehicle where driver assistance systems including Autopilot and more advanced systems were thought to be a factor. Nineteen fatalities were reported as part of those Tesla-involved collisions under investigation.

Separately California's DMV recently accused Tesla of deceptive marketing practices with regard to the features in its vehicles and it is conducting a technical review of Tesla's systems including FSD Beta.

Ashok Elluswamy Tesla's director of Autopilot software said on Twitter this weekend that ""Autopilot prevents ~40 crashes /day where human drivers mistakenly press the accelerator at 100% instead of the brakes."" Tesla generally does not make data about its systems available to third-party researchers for confirmation of its claims."

All animal work was done in accordance with Northwestern University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approval. Mice were fed a standard rodent chow diet and water ad libitum and housed with a standard 12-hour light/dark cycle. 5XFAD mice on a C57BL6 background (Jackson Laboratories) were maintained by crossing transgene positive hemizygous male C57BL6 mice with transgene negative female C57BL6 mice (Jackson Laboratories). In our chronic treatment protocol drug treatments were initiated at 2 months old the age at which plaque deposition is beginning [36 37]. In the acute treatment protocol drug treatment was initiated at 5 months of age after which plaque deposition and axonal degeneration is widespread [38 39].

LNK-754 was synthesized by Link Medicine (Massachusetts USA) and lonafarnib was obtained from Cayman Chemical Company (Ann Harbor MI). For animal treatments LNK-745 and lonafarnib were prepared in a heated solution of 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose (Sigma-Aldrich) as a vehicle at a concentration of 0.10 mg/mL until dissolved and the solution was clear. Aliquots for injection were frozen at − 20 °C and then thawed and stored at 4 °C for each week of treatment. Mice were treated following an established protocol known to enhance lysosome activity [8]. In the chronic treatment protocol 2-month-old 5XFAD mice were injected by intraperitoneal (i.p) injection with either vehicle LNK-754 or lonafarnib daily using a 29-guage insulin syringe for a 12-week period until mice were 5 months old. In the acute treatment regimen 5-month-old 5XFAD mice were i.p injected daily for a 3-week period. Upon completion of treatments mice were anesthetized perfused and brains were collected for further analyses (see below sections). For cell culture experiments LNK-754 and lonafarnib were dissolved in DMSO and added to mouse primary neuron cultures at a concentration of 10 nM for a 48-hour period. The vehicle treatment was an equivalent amount of DMSO. Cells were collected and analyzed as described below.

Antibodies

The antibodies used for immunofluorescence experiments were rat anti-LAMP1 (#1D4B DSHB) rabbit anti-Aβ42 (#700254 Invitrogen) rabbit anti-BACE1 (#ab108394 Abcam) rabbit anti-βIII tubulin (#ab18207 Abcam). For immunoblotting the antibodies used were rabbit anti-actin (#926–42210 LI-COR) rabbit anti-p44/42 MAPK (pErk1/2) (#CS9101 Cell Signaling Technology) rabbit anti-44/42 (Erk1/2) (#CS137F5 Cell Signaling Technology) rabbit anti-LAMP1 (#CS3234 Cell Signaling Technology) mouse anti-BACE (3D5; Zhao et al. 2007) mouse anti-APP (6E10) (#803001 BioLegend) rabbit anti-p-tau (ser404) (#CS20194 Cell Signaling Technology) mouse anti-Tau1 (#MAB3420 Millipore Sigma) prelamin-A (#MABPT858 Millipore Sigma) and mouse anti-HDJ-2 (#sc-59554 Santa Cruz). Anti-rabbit or -mouse secondary antibodies from Vector Laboratories were used for immunoblots.

Behavioral testing

Animals and drug treatment

Behavioral analyses were performed by reMYND Inc. using the hAPP/PS1 mouse model with neuron-specific expression of a clinical mutant of the human amyloid precursor protein together with a clinical mutant of human presenilin 1 [40]. This double transgenic mouse displays spontaneous progressive accumulation of Aβ in the brain eventually resulting in amyloid plaques within subiculum hippocampus and cortex at 6 months of age. 48 female hAPP/PS1 mice in FVB x C57Bl/6 J background of 6 months of age were used for this study in combination with 12 age-matched female wild type controls in FVB x C57Bl/6 J background. Administration of 0.9 mg/kg/day of LNK-754 was performed per oral gavage once a day during 12 consecutive days. The sacrifice of the animals was performed 2 hours after final dosing.

All mice were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at the age of 3 weeks and received a unique identity number once the PCR results were known. All mice were double checked by a second PCR before the onset of the study. All mice were blind randomized and age-matched. Mice were given a random number by computer and allocated randomly to a treatment. The animals were re-caged by treatment group 15 days before the onset of the study to allow them to familiarize to the new cage context. Mice had free access to pre-filtered and sterile water and standard mouse chow (Sniff® Ms-H Sniff Spezialdiäten GmbH Soest Germany). The food was stored under dry and cool conditions in a well-ventilated storage room. The amount of water and food was checked daily supplied when necessary and standard refreshed once a week. Mice were initially housed under a reversed day-night rhythm (14 hours light/10 hours darkness) starting at 7 p.m. in standard metal cages type RVS T2 (area of 540 cm2). The cages are equipped with solid floors and layer of bedding litter. The number of mice per cage was limited in accordance with local legislation on animal welfare. 15 days before the start of treatment mice were re-caged in individual ventilated macrolon T2 cages and transported to the laboratory for acclimation to the laboratory environment in preparation for treatment. In the laboratory the day-night rhythm was changed to 12 hours light/ 12 hours darkness starting at 7 p.m.

Morris water maze

The Morris Water Maze was performed on days 8–12 of treatment and the animals were sacrificed directly after the probe test. The pool (a white circular vessel 1 m in diameter) contained water at 20 °C with titanium-dioxide as an odorless nontoxic additive to hide the escape platform (1 cm beneath the water level). Swimming of each mouse was videotaped and analyzed (Ethovision Noldus information Technology Wageningen the Netherlands). Prior to training each mouse was placed on top of the platform for 15 seconds. For place navigation tests mice were trained to locate the hidden platform in seven blocks of three trials over four consecutive days. Each trial consists of a forced swim test of maximum 120 seconds followed by 10 minutes of rest. The time each mouse needed to locate the platform was measured. The seven consecutive blocks result in a learning curve. 24 hours after the last training each animal had a probe trial with the platform removed. Mice were allowed to search for 60 seconds and quadrant search time and crossings of the original platform position was measured. During the final probe test mice were allowed to search the previous location of the platform during 60 seconds after the platform was removed.

Primary neuron culture

Forebrains were dissected in Hanks’ Balanced Salt solution (HBSS) (Thermo Fisher #14185–052) from pregnant wild-type C57BL6 mice (Jackson) on E15.5 to obtain primary neurons. Dissected forebrains were digested in 2.5% trypsin at 37 °C for 20 minutes. A fire-polished Pasteur pipette was used to dissociate the neurons in HBSS. The neurons were then plated on a poly-L-lysine-coated six-well plate 2 × 106 neurons per well in neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B-27 500 μM glutamine 10% horse serum and 2.5 μM glutamate (all from Thermo Fisher). The media was changed 2 hours later to Neurobasal with 2% B-27 500 μM glutamine and 2.5 μM glutamate. 24 hours later the media was changed to Neurobasal plus 2% B-27 and 500 μM glutamine. Half media changes were made every 2–3 days. Primary neurons were cultured for 7 days and treated with vehicle (DMSO) or 10 nM concentrations of LNK-754 or lonafarnib for 48 hours. Neurons were then fixed or live imaged as described below. For fixation neurons were incubated for 20 minutes in 4% paraformaldehyde 0.12 M sucrose in 1XPBS permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 and incubated with primary antibodies overnight followed by donkey anti-mouse Alexafluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes 1:1000) and co-stained with 300 nM DAPI. Coverslips were mounted using Prolong Gold (Molecular Probes) and images acquired on a Nikon A1 confocal microscope with a 60X objective (NA 1.4) and NIS Elements software.

Live imaging of neurons

For live-imaging experiments neurons were prepared as above and plated in 35 mm glass bottom dishes (MatTek # P35G-1.5-14C) for 7 days in culture. 10 nM LNK-754 or lonafarnib were then added to conditioned media control cultures were treated with DMSO as a vehicle. After 48 hours of treatment media was replaced with conditioned media from untreated parallel plates of neurons. 25 nM of LysoTracker-Green DND-26 (#L7526 Invitrogen) was added to the conditioned media and neurons were incubated for 30 minutes at 37 °C. Time-lapse imaging of neurons was performed using a Ti2 widefield microscope. Imaging began immediately at 30 minutes and continued for no longer than 30 minutes. 1-s exposures were taken every minute and 20–30 separate areas per dish were imaged within 30 mins. The distance and velocity quantifications of LysoTracker particles and kymograph analyses were performed using NIS Elements software and described in detail below. In separate experiments 1 μM Lysosensor-Green DND-189 (#L7535 Invitrogen) was added to conditioned media and captured images of live neurons were taken for no longer than 15 minutes using a Nikon A1 confocal microscope with a 60X objective (NA 1.4) and NIS Elements software.

Live imaging of brain tissues

5-month-old 5XFAD mice were i.p injected daily for a 3-week period and upon treatment completion mice were anesthetized and perfused with a solution containing 1 M KCl 1 M MgCl 2  0.1 mM kynurenate 0.01 mM DL-2-Amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid 5 mM glutathione 25 mM glucose 125 mM NaCl 1.4 mM NaH 2 PO 4 and 25 mM NaHCO 3 . Brains were then rapidly dissected in ice-cold oxygenated ACSF containing 2.5 mM KCl 85 mM NaCl 1.25 mM NaH 2 PO 4  25 mM NaHCO 3  0.5 mM CaCl 2  4 mM 4 MgCl 2  75 mM sucrose 25 mM glucose 50uM C 6 H 7 NaO 6  0.1 mM kynurenate 0.01 mM DL-2-Amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid and 5 mM glutathione. 300 μm coronal slices were obtained using a Compresstome VF-200 vibrating microtome (Precisionary Instruments) and allowed to rest for 30 minutes for recovery at 32 °C in oxygenated ACSF solution containing the following 2.5 mM KCl 85 mM NaCl 1.25 mM NaH 2 PO 4  25 mM NaHCO 3  0.5 mM CaCl 2  4 mM 4 MgCl 2  75 mM sucrose 25 mM glucose 50uM C 6 H 7 NaO 6  0.1 mM kynurenate 0.01 mM DL-2-Amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid and 5 mM glutathione. The slices were then transferred to 35 mm glass bottom dishes (MatTek # P35G-1.5-14C) containing oxygenated ACSF with 25 nM LysoTracker-Green and a 1:10000 dilution of 1 mg/mL Thiazine Red (#S570435 Sigma Aldrich) that was otherwise identical to the ACSF used during the recovery period. Slice viability was confirmed using time-lapse imaging of tissues. Slices were incubated with LysoTracker-Green and Thiazine Red for 15 minutes at room temperature and then cortical brain regions were imaged immediately in the same solution at 32 °C on a Nikon A1 confocal microscope with a 60X objective (NA 1.4) and NIS Elements software for no longer than 30 minutes.

Brain extraction and immunoblotting

Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of xylazine (15 mg/kg) and ketamine (100 mg/kg) perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (1XPBS) with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (20 μg/ml) leupeptin (0.5 μg/ml) sodium orthovanadate (20 μM) and dithiothreitol (0.1 mM) followed by brain removal. All buffers used for protein extraction contained protease inhibitor cocktail III (#535140 Millipore) and Halt phosphatase inhibitor (#78420 Thermo Fisher Scientific). Hemibrain tissues were weighed and manually homogenized using a dounce homogenizer 1:10 (w/v) in 1XPBS. After homogenization lysates were centrifuged at 20800 g for 30 minutes at 4 °C. The soluble fraction (supernatant) was removed and the pellet was resuspended by pipetting in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer [50 mM tris 0.15 M NaCl 1% octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol (IGEPAL) 1 mM EDTA 1 mM EGTA 0.1% SDS and 0.5% sodium deoxylate at pH 8] to incubate on ice for 30 minutes. The samples were sonicated (Misonix XL-2000) for 20 seconds on ice and then centrifuged at 20800 g for 30 minutes at 4 °C. The RIPA-soluble fraction (supernatant) was removed and the pellet was resuspended in 5 M guanidine (pH 8.0) for analysis of insoluble proteins. Each sample was sonicated for 20 seconds on ice rotated for 1 hour at room temperature and then centrifuged at 20800 g for 30 minutes at 4 °C. The bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (#23225 Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to measure the protein concentration of each sample.

For western blots 20 μg of protein of each sample was loaded onto 4–12% NuPAGE (Invitrogen) gels and separated using MOPS buffer under reduced and denatured conditions. The proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and developed using Pierce ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The developed signals were visualized using ProteinSimple FCR (FluorChem R) and the subsequent chemiluminescent signals were quantified using AlphaView software (ProteinSimple). All blots were analyzed using the Local Background Correction tool except for the HDJ-2 blot which was analyzed using the Background Link tool in conjunction with Multi-regional Background Correction (AlphaView software).

Aβ42 ELISA

To measure Aβ42 in hemibrain homogenates from 5XFAD mice a commercially available Enzyme- Linked-Immunosorbent-Assay (ELISA) (Thermo Fisher Scientific KHB3441) was used following the manufacturer’s instructions to analyze guanidine and PBS-soluble Aβ42 in hemibrains. To measure Aβ42 in brains of hAPP/PS1 mice a commercially available ELISA was used (h amyloid β42 ELISA high sensitive The Genetics Company Zurich Switzerland). The ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Mouse brain tissue immunofluorescence

After perfusion brains were extracted and hemibrains were fixed in 10% formalin followed by cryopreservation in 30% sucrose solution in 1XPBS. A freezing-sliding microtome was used to harvest 30-μm coronal or sagittal sections. Sections were serially placed in a 12-well plate in a cryoprotective solution (1xPBS 30% sucrose and 30% ethylene glycol) and stored at − 20 °C until use. Immunofluorescence staining was performed by first washing sections three times in 1XTBS and then incubating sections in 16 mM glycine in 1XTBS for 1 hour at room temperature. After 3 additional washes in 1XTBS sections were blocked in 5% goat serum in 0.25% Triton X-100 in 1XTBS for 2 hours at room temperature. The sections were then incubated overnight in primary antibodies in a solution of 0.25% Triton X-100 1% bovine serum albumin and 1XTBS at 4 °C. Secondary immunostaining was then performed with donkey AlexaFluor–labeled secondary antibodies at a concentration of 1:1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). ProLong Gold (#P36934 Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to mount sections before being imaged on a Ti2 wide-field microscope or a Nikon A1 laser scanning confocal microscope for image quantification using Nikon NIS Elements software for acquisition. All acquisition settings remained the same between genotypes and all images were acquired within same imaging period for individual experiments (Northwestern University Center for Advanced Microscopy and Nikon Imaging Centre).

Image quantification

Mouse brains

Immunofluorescence quantification of mouse brain tissue immunostaining was performed on 3–5 sections per animal from Bregma coordinates of approximately − 0.94 to − 2.55 mm which were imaged using a 10X objective on a Ti2 wide-field microscope. Quantification analyses including size and intensity thresholds were performed using Nikon NIS-Elements Software (Northwestern University Nikon Imaging Center). Depending on the signal thresholds were set using the General Analysis tool based on object size shape and contrast and then binary masks were created for each channel and region of interest. Thresholding was performed separately on each channel to isolate signals of interest by optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio and eliminating non-specific background signal. For the calculation of LAMP1 BACE1 or LysoTracker-Green covered area as well as LAMP1 and Lysosensor fluorescence intensity measurements in primary neurons regions of interest were manually traced using NIS-Elements and a binary layer was created for each region of interest. To calculate the ratio of LAMP1 to Aβ42 the area of LAMP1 in dystrophic neurites was normalized to the area of Aβ42 on an individual plaque basis and the average ratios per mouse between treatment groups were quantified. Pearson’s correlation coefficient analysis for BACE1 and LAMP1 was performed using NIS-Elements on a per plaque basis on maximum intensity projections of 30 μm Z-stack images taken using a Nikon A1 laser scanning confocal microscope with a 1 μm step size. To calculate the ratio of LysoTracker-Green to Thiazine red the area of LysoTracker-Green in dystrophic neurites was normalized to the area of Thiazine Red on an individual plaque basis and the average ratio per mouse was quantified between treatment groups. Four coronal sections from Bregma coordinates of approximately − 1.70 to − 2.55 mm were used to calculate the area or intensity of each signal in each respective brain region for each mouse. Analysis of plaque covered area and plaque size was performed using the average of five sections per mouse from Bregma coordinates of approximately − 0.94 to − 2.55 mm. Section selection image acquisition image tracing and quantifications were performed by a person blinded to treatment groups and genotypes.

Primary neurons

For the quantifications of LAMP1 immunostaining in fixed mouse primary neurons somas were manually traced based on morphology using NIS-Elements and a binary mask was created for each region of interest and channel. Thresholding was used to optimize LAMP1 signals and distinguish LAMP1 in neurites including both dendrites and axons by isolating pixels of LAMP1 positive for tubulin pixels. The cell soma LAMP1 signals were excluded from total LAMP1 area to analyze LAMP1 vesicles in neurites. For analysis of LysoTracker-Green motility in neurons images were quantified using NIS-Elements. The speed and distance of total LysoTracker-Green particles in each frame were tracked using the automated motion tracking feature in NIS-Elements. A threshold was set and applied to all movies based on size and fluorescence intensity of LysoTracker-Green particles to eliminate background noise. For kymograph generation time-lapse imaging of single neurons was performed on a 60X confocal microscope and axons were identified morphologically. The percentage of frequency of particles moving in an anterograde or retrograde direction or stationary was quantified by dividing the number of particles for each group by the total number of particles. For kymograph analyses moving particles were defined as having speed above 0.1 μM/sec.

Statistical analysis

GraphPad Prism software v8 was used to perform statistical analyses including analysis of variance (ANOVA) with posthoc tests when comparing more than two samples and unpaired t test when only two samples were being compared. Specific test details including number of replicates type of posthoc tests and P values are stated in figure legends. All quantifications are plotted at the mean ± SEM. Significance was concluded when the P value was less than 0.05 indicated by *P < 0.05 **P < 0.01 ***P < 0.001 ****P < 0.0001.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQyMDAzLTAyMi0wMzc4MS0z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Plant hairy roots for the production of extracellular vesicles with antitumor bioactivity | Communications Biology,"Plant material and growth conditions

Salvia dominica seeds were kindly provided by Ammar Bader (Department of Pharmacognosy Umm Al-Qura University Saudi Arabia). The seeds were surface sterilized with 70% (v/v) ethanol for 1 min and then with 2% (v/v) sodium hypochlorite solution for 10 min rinsed five times with sterile distilled water for 1 min each and then sown under aseptic conditions in autoclaved Murashige & Skoog (MS) medium (pH 5.8) containing 30 g/L sucrose and 9 g/L agar. The plants were grown in vitro at 23 °C under a photoperiod of 8 hour dark and 16 hour light in a controlled growth chamber with a photosynthetically active radiation of 110 μmol m–2 s–1 at the leaf level.

Hairy root cultures production and characterization

The protocol to obtain hairy roots of Salvia dominica was adapted from our previous work26. Briefly the Agrobacterium rhizogenes virulent strain ATCC 15834 obtained from a single colony was grown (OD 600 = 0.3–0.5) in Yeast Extract Broth (YEB) liquid medium (0.1% Yeast extract 0.5% Beef extract 0.5% Peptone 0.5% Sucrose 0.04% MgSO 4 ) at 26 °C. Before transformation bacteria were collected from liquid cultures at 5000 rpm for 5 min and resuspended at a cell density OD 600 = 0.5 in YEB and were shaken for 1 h in the rotary shaker before inoculation. S. dominica sterile leaf explants from 20 day-old plants aseptically grown in vitro were submerged in the bacterial suspension for 30 min. Then leaf explants were taken and dried under laminar flow hood for 15 minutes and co-cultivated at 26 °C for 3 days in MS30 solid medium and then transferred to fresh MS medium containing cefotaxime (CX 100 mg/L) and kept in petri dish in the dark at 23 °C. After three weeks of several subcultures of infected leaves in media containing decreasing concentrations of CX (from 100 mg/L to 50 mg/L) hairy roots developing from the infected sites were individually excised sub-cultured weekly in solid MS medium and kept for additional two weeks in the dark at 23 °C. Subsequently hairy roots were transferred in hormone free liquid MS medium and maintained in aseptic condition (MS medium CX 50 mg/L) at 26 °C in the dark in a shaking incubator (140 rpm). To confirm that the differentiated roots were HRs (and not adventitious roots) and that A. rhizogenes was efficiently eradicated PCR analysis was carried out in order to check the presence of rolB and the absence of virD2 genes respectively. DNA purification of three independent hairy root lines and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) were carried out by using Thermo Scientific Phire Plant Direct PCR Kit and the gene-specific primers: Actin (HM231319 forward primer: 5′-GGTGCCCTGAGGTCCTGTT-3′; reverse primer: 5′-GAGCCACCACTGAGGACAAT-3′; amplicon length: 142 bp); rolB (GenBank:X03433.1; forward primer: 5′- GATTCAACCATATCGGAGCG -3′; reverse primer: 5′- TGAGCATGTGCTGTTTTTGG -3′; amplicon length: 590 bp); rolC (MT514512.1; forward primer: 5′-CGACCTGTGTTCTCTTTTTCAAGC-3′; primer reverse: 5′-GCACTCGCCATGCCTCACCAACTCACC-3′; amplicon length: 514 bp); VirD2 (forward primer: 5′-ATGCCCGATCGAGCTCAAGT; reverse primer: 5′-CCTGACCCAAACATCTCGGCT-3′; amplicon length: 317 bp).

PCR was performed using the following conditions: initial denaturation at 98 °C for 5′ followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 98 °C for 15” annealing at 55 °C for 15” and extension at 72 °C for 45” and final extension at 72 °C for 5′. Then PCR amplified products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel.

Isolation of extracellular vesicles

Extracellular vesicles were isolated from the conditioned culture medium of S. dominica hairy roots (approximately 40 mL of medium for 2 grams of hairy roots) using differential centrifugation method. Overall the medium was collected after 10 days of subculturing and used fresh for EV isolation. Alternatively the conditioned media were stored in 50 mL tubes at –80 °C up to one month.

Briefly the medium was initially centrifuged at 300 × g for 10 minutes and then at 2000 × g for 20 minutes to remove living or dead cells and cell debris. Afterwards the supernatants were filtered using 0.45 µm pore size membrane filters (Merck Millipore) to remove contaminating apoptotic bodies very small cell debris and organelles.

Additional low velocity centrifugation was performed using 50 mL Beckman polypropylene tubes with the Beckman Type 55.2 Ti fixed angle rotor (k-factor: 64) at 15000 × g for 20 minutes at room temperature. Clarified conditioned medium was then centrifuged to pellet extracellular vesicles using thick wall polycarbonate tubes (Beckman Coulter No. 355631) in a Beckman Coulter Optima™ L-90K ultracentrifuge at 100000 × g avg at 4 °C for 3 hours with a Type 55.2 Ti rotor. The pellet was solubilised in 30 μl of MilliQ water and transferred in 1.5 mL tubes. After the isolation EV were used fresh for subsequent analyses or stored at –80 °C avoiding freeze-thaw cycles.

EV protein profiling by SDS-PAGE

The quality of the vesicle samples and the reproducibility of EV isolation were controlled using sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). First ten microliters of each samples (corresponding approximatively to 1.9e + 07 EVs) were electrophoretically separated under reducing conditions on polyacrylamide gel and then silver-stained as described by Shevchenko et al.67 with small modifications. Silver staining has been conducted in all the EV preparations.

Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)

Size distribution of extracellular nanovesicles was measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) using a Zetasizer Ver. 7.01 Malvern Instrument (Malvern UK). Ten microliters of EV preparation were dispersed in deionized MilliQ water and the intensity of the scattered light was measured with a detector at 90° angle at room temperature. To prove the EV sensitivity to detergents HR-derived EVs were incubated with 1% SDS and kept at room temperature for 1 h. Then the samples were analysed by DLS as above mentioned. Measurements were carried out in three different EV preparations.

Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA)

The size distribution and concentration of HR-derived EVs were analysed by NTA using a NanoSight model NS300 equipped with a Blue405laser and a sCMOS camera (Malvern Instruments Malvern UK). The samples (15 μl) were diluted in 0.5 ml PBS and mixed well and the diluted samples were then injected into the laser chamber. The following settings were used for data acquisition: camera level 9 acquisition time 30 s and detection threshold 2. For each measurement three videos were captured under the following conditions: cell temperature: 24 °C; Syringe speed: 50 µl/s. After capture the videos have been analysed by the NanoSight Software NTA 3.4 with a detection threshold of 2. Three independent experiments were carried out.

Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)

Before using a grid of carbon film supported on 300 mesh copper grid a glow discharge was performed on it (30 s 15 mA). The samples were fixed using glutaraldehyde 2.5% in PBS and deposited on a parafilm. The grid was placed on the drop for 5 min washed with distilled water for 1 min and placed for 1 min in a drop of 3 microliters of 2% staining agent (Methylamine Vanadate NanoVan) and diluted in H 2 O before washing it with water for 1 min. TEM images were collected using a FEI Tecnai T20 (FEI Europe Eindhoven Netherlands) in the Laboratorio de Microscopias Avanzadas at Universidad de Zaragoza (Spain). TEM observations have been carried out in three independent EV preparations.

Proteomic and Bioinformatic analyses

Protein extracts from purified HR-derived EVs and from pellet fractions collected at low-speed centrifugation were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. Resulting gels were divided into 10 pieces and each underwent a trypsin in gel digestion procedure. The obtained peptide mixtures were analysed on a Orbitrap Q-Exactive Classic Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled with a nanoUltimate300 UHPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptide separation was performed on a capillary EASY-Spray PepMap column (0.075 mm × 50 mm 2 µm Thermo Fisher Scientific) using aqueous 0.1% formic acid (A) and CH3CN containing 0.1% formic acid (B) as mobile phases and a linear gradient from 3 to 40% of B in 45 minutes and a 300 nL·min−1 flow rate. Mass spectra were acquired over an m/z range from 375 to 1500. To achieve sequence confirmation MS and MS/MS data underwent Mascot software (v2.5 Matrix Science) analysis using the non- redundant Data Bank UniprotKB/Swiss-Prot (Release 2021_03) limited to green plants proteins (Viridiplantae). Parameter sets were: trypsin cleavage; carbamidomethylation of cysteine as a fixed modification and methionine oxidation as a variable modification; a maximum of two missed cleavages; false discovery rate (FDR) calculated by searching the decoy database 0.05. Proteomic analyses were performed in duplicate on three different vesicle preparations and only the proteins commonly identified in all the experiments were considered. Gene ontology analysis of identified proteins was carried out using the specific tool in UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB; http://www.uniprot.org).

Human cell culture

MIA PaCa-2 (CRL-1420™) are immortalized epithelial cells of human pancreatic carcinoma. They were purchased from ATCC (Manassas VA USA) and cultured as reported68. HaCaT cells are human immortalized keratinocytes. They were purchased from CLS Cell Lines Service GmbH (Germany) and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). MCF-7 (HTB-22™) are human breast cancer cells and were purchased from ATCC (Manassas VA USA). Both cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).

All the media were supplemented with antibiotics (10000 U/ml penicillin and 10 mg/ml streptomycin) cells were stained at 37 °C in 5% CO 2 −95% air humidified atmosphere and were serially passed at 70–80% confluence.

MTT assay

HaCaT MIA PaCa-2 and MCF-7 cells were seeded in 15 × 103 cells/well in triplicate in 96 well-plates and incubated for 24 and 48 h with freshly prepared S. dominica EVs at a three different concentrations namely 6 × 107 1.2 × 108 and 3 × 108 particles/mL. Cells treated with heat-inactivated EVs were used as negative controls. To this aim EV preparations were kept at 95 °C for 1 h cooled down at room temperature for 2 h and then administered to the cell cultures.

As reported in Bizzarro et al.69 at the ends of the selected experimental times 3-(45-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-25-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) stock solution (5 mg/ml) was added to each well (25 μl per 100 μl medium) and plates were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Cells were then lysed and the dark blue formazan crystals dissolved with 100 μl of a solution containing 50% (v/v) N N-dimethylformamide 20% (w/v) SDS with an adjusted pH of 4.5. The optical density (OD) of each well was measured in a microplate spectrophotometer (Titertek Multiskan MCC/340) equipped with a 620 nm filter. The viability of cells in response to the treatments with gemcitabine HR-derived EVs and heat-denatured EVs was calculated as: % viable cells = [OD (550 nm–690 nm) treatments/OD (550 nm–690 nm) negative control] × 100. Values were presented as means ± SD of three independent experiments carried out in triplicate.

Cell uptake and confocal microscopy

EVs were labelled with BODIPY® FL N-(2-aminoethyl)maleimide. Briefly 10 μL of Bodipy dye was added to 13.5 mL of S. dominica HR conditioned medium and mixed for 30 sec. After 5 min incubation at room temperature EVs were isolated by ultracentrifugation as described before. After 24 and 48 h EV treatment MIA PaCa-2 cells were harvested and used for confocal analysis performed as reported in a previous work70. Briefly cells were fixed in p-formaldehyde (4% v/v in PBS; Lonza; Basel Switzerland) were permeabilized with Triton X-100 (0.4% v/v in PBS; Lonza; Basel Switzerland) blocked with goat serum (20% v/v in PBS; Lonza; Basel Switzerland) and then incubated with anti-annexin A1 antibody (rabbit polyclonal; 1:100; Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham MA USA) overnight at 4 °C. After two washing steps cells were incubated with anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 555 (1:500; Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham MA USA) for 2 h at RT in the dark. To detect the nuclei 4′6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI 1:1000) was used. Samples were vertically scanned from the bottom of the coverslip with a total depth of 5 μm and a 63X (1.40 NA) Plan-Apochromat oil-immersion objective. Images and scale bars were generated with Zeiss ZEN Confocal Software (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH) and presented as single stack. Confocal microscopy analyses were carried out in three independent experiments.

Apoptosis analysis by Flow Cytometry

The percentage of hypodiploid nuclei was estimated by propidium iodide (PI) incorporation into permeabilized cells as described by Belvedere et al68. Briefly cancer cells were harvested after treatment with S. dominica EVs and incubated with a PI solution (0.1% sodium citrate 0.1% Triton X-100) and 50 g/ mL of PI (Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis MO USA) for 30 min at room temperature. Data from 10000 events for each sample were collected by a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson Franklin Lakes NJ USA) using Cell Quest evaluation program. FACS analyses were conducted in technical triplicate at least in three independent biological experiments.

Western blot analysis

Cells were lysed in a RIPA buffer containing 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 NaCl 150 mM and Triton 1% supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Cocktails (Sigma Aldrich) and the protein content was measured by a colorimetric assay (BIO-RAD) as described in71. Protein cell lysates (20 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE under denaturing conditions transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter (BIO-RAD) blocked with 5% milk and probed with primary antibodies: mouse anti-PARP1 (1:500) rabbit anti-procaspase-3 (1:500) and mouse anti-βactin (1:1000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After primary antibody incubation the blots were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The proteins recognized by Abs were detected by ECL (Amersham biosciences) and exposed to Las4000 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) and the relative band intensities were determined using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Pre-stained protein markers (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used as molecular size standards. All experiments were performed in triplicate.

Statistics and reproducibility

Sample size and number of replicates for each experiment were described in figure legends where possible. Otherwise these data were properly reported throughout the materials and methods section. Error bars in the graphical data represent standard deviations. A Student’s t‐test was used for statistical analysis and P‐values ≤0.05 (*) ≤0.01 (**) and ≤0.001 (***) were considered to be statistically significant.

Housing conditions and manipulation of hens employed in the maintenance of the insect colony followed the protocol authorized by the Animal Care Committee of the Centro de Investigaciones en Bioquímica Clínica e Inmunología (CIBICI-CONICET-Universidad Nacional de Córdoba). They followed the guidelines published by the Canadian Council on Animal Care with the assurance number A5802-01 delivered by the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (National Institutes of Health). The animal facility at the CIBICI-CONICET is a dependency of the Argentine National Ministry of Science Science (http://www.bioterios.mincyt.gob.ar). No infected insect species human blood or hen sacrifices were involved in the study. Details of the approved protocol were previously published17.

Insects

Anautogenous females were taken from a colony of D. maxima maintained at 28 °C 70% relative humidity 8:16 h light/dark photoperiod. Standardized conditions of insect rearing were previously described15. Briefly females were separated from males at the last nymphal stage before blood feeding. Newly emerged females were segregated individually and placed in jars together with two fed males. Successful mating was confirmed by observation of the spermatophore. Mated females were kept in individual jars until they were able to take a blood meal (days 10–12 post-ecdysis) which resulted in a 3.0–5.5-fold increase in the body weight of the insect. Thereafter egg laying was daily monitored and the beginning and the end of the oviposition period were recorded. Unless otherwise stated experiments were performed by sampling hemolymph and tissues at representative days of the reproductive cycle as previously descibed1517: pre-vitellogenesis (days 4–6 post-ecdysis unfed period); vitellogenesis (days 2 3 4 6 and 12 post-blood feeding); and post-vitellogenesis (days 12–14 after the end of oviposition).

Hemolymph and tissues sampling

Hemolymph was individually collected from immobilized females with a Hamilton syringe by cutting off the legs at the level of the coxa and gently pressing the abdomen. The collected samples were placed in cold tubes containing 10 mM Na 2 EDTA 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and a cocktail of protease inhibitors (P8340 Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis MO USA) as previously described 1719. Hemolymph samples were centrifuged at 10000 × g for 10 min at 4 ℃ to remove hemocytes. Protein amounts were measured using the Bradford method40. Samples were stored at − 70 °C until use. Ovarian tissues and fat bodies from females at representative days of the reproductive cycle were dissected out in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 6.6 mM Na 2 HPO 4 /KH 2 PO 4  150 mM NaCl pH 7.4) using a standard stereoscope as previously described 1719.

Cloning the full-length cDNA of DmaxMet

The complete sequences of the DmaxMet transcripts were obtained by Rapid Amplification cDNA End (RACE) (SMARTer RACE 5′/3′ kit Takara Bio USA Inc). Briefly for the first cDNA synthesis step a universal mixture of primers was used to recognize specific regions of the 3′ or 5′ ends (3′ RACE-cDNA or 5′ RACE-cDNA respectively). Synthesis of RACE-cDNAs was performed using 1 μg of ovarian total RNA. For the RACE amplification reaction DmaxMet gene-specific primers were: a forward primer for 3′ RACE-cDNA and a reverse primer for 5′ RACE-cDNA. To achieve optimal yields the DmaxMet primers were designed with a length of 23–28 nucleotides (nt) containing a guanidine/cytosine (GC) ratio of 50–70% and a melting temperature (Tm) > 70%. Additionally a 15 nt sequence (GATTACGCCAAGCTT) necessary for the insertion of the gene of interest into the p-RACE vector was added to the primers. Once the amplification reaction was completed the size of the RACE product was verified by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. For optimal quality in the sequencing the fragments obtained by RACE were cloned on the p-RACE vector following the manufacturers' recommendations. The clones obtained were then sequenced using a 3130XL Genetic Analysers in the DNA core facility at FIU (Miami FL USA).

Bioinformatic analyses and modelling

The deduced amino acid sequence molecular mass and isoelectric point prediction for the two DmaxMet isoforms were assessed using tools available on Expasy (http://web.www.expasy.org; SIB Bioinformatics Resource Portal). The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool algorithm (BLAST https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) was employed to compare the sequence of the transcripts coding for DmaxMet isoforms with other Met sequences deposited in databases. BLAST was also used to predict the major functional domains of the receptor. Mapping of exons in DmaxMet was achieved with the Exon–Intron Graphic Maker (http://wormweb.org/exonintron) taking as references the homologous sequences reported for R. prolixus21.

The molecular model of DmaxMet was built by homology modelling using I-TASSER package22. The HIF2α–Arnt crystal structure (PDB ID 3F1P) was chosen as an homologous template7. The visualization of the structures was performed by UCSF Chimera41 and PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System Version 2.0 Schrödinger LLC).

The obtained DmaxMet three-dimensional model was used in docking simulation to analyze the interaction between DmaxMet and JHSB 3  only the DmaxMet PAS domain were considered since they are the only domains with crystallized templates deposited in databases. The docking calculations were carried out with DockThor version 24243.

For the evolutionary analysis of Met the predicted amino acid sequences for DmaxMet were compared with selected Met sequences retrieved from the NCBI database. The sequences were aligned using MAFFT44 and twenty alternative full-length alignments were combined via GUIDANCE245 and used for inferring the protein phylogeny. The phylogenetic tree was constructed with PhyML46 under Maximum Likelihood model (LG + G + I)474849 using branch support analysis50.

RNA extraction and reverse transcriptase quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR)

Ovaries and fat bodies were subjected to RNA extraction with TRIzol (Thermofisher Waltham MA USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were treated with DNase to remove genomic DNA (Promega Heidelberg Germany) and RNA integrity was evaluated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. cDNA synthesis from 2 µg of total RNA was performed using the Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus reverse transcriptase protocol (M-MLV Promega Heidelberg Germany). The qPCR assays were performed with an ABI Prism 7500 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems Foster City CA USA) using a Power SYBR Green PCR master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham MA USA) as previously described19. The 2−ΔΔCt method was employed to evaluate of relative changes in gene expression51 using 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) as a reference gene 1952. Unless otherwise stated all reactions were carried out by triplicate. The primer sequences of all genes assayed are displayed on Supplementary Table 1. In the case of DmaxMet the primers were designed to target a region shared by the DmaxMet 1 and DmaxMet 2. In D. maxima vitellogenin (Vg) is the product of the genes Vg1 and Vg2 the latter showing the highest level of expression19. Therefore in the present work Vg2 was the gene quantified and named Vg for simplicity.

The amplification efficiency for each pair of primers was calculated using standard curves generated by serial dilutions of cDNA. All reactions showed an efficiency higher than 96% for the different pair of primers tested.

Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) synthesis and knockdown of DmaxMet gene expression

A 317 base pair Met template was used to synthesize a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecule. Gene-specific primers targeting a region shared by the two DmaxMet isoforms were designed and then combined with the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence. The synthesis of dsRNAs was carried out using the MEGAScript RNAi kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. dsRNAs were precipitated with ammonium acetate/ethanol and then suspended in ultrapure RNase-free water to a final concentration of 5 μg/μl. A dsRNA molecule based on the ampicillin resistance gene (dsARG) from the pGEM-T Easy Vector system was used as a control as previously described 1953.

To knockdown the expression of DmaxMet adult females at 10–12 days post-ecdysis were injected into the hemocoel with 10 µg of dsMet or dsARG (control) dissolved in 2 µl of ultrapure water using a Hamilton microsyringe. At 24 h post-injection dsRNA-treated insects were fed with blood and 2 days later fat bodies and ovaries were individually sampled and processed by qPCR to determine the DmaxMet mRNA levels. The effect of DmaxMet silencing on Vg and Lp gene expression in fat bodies as well as on VgR and LpR in ovarian tissue was also assessed by qPCR.

Vitellogenin and lipophorin assessments

To further evaluate the relevance of DmaxMet knockdown on the yolk protein precursors Vg and Lp metabolism a group of females were treated with dsMet or dsARG (control). At 24 h post-injection dsRNA-treated insects were fed with blood and 2 days later hemolymph fat bodies and ovaries were collected. Quantification of Vg and Lp was accomplished by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a polyclonal anti-vitellin antibody (anti-Vt 1:4000) and a polyclonal anti-lipophorin antibody (anti-Lp 1:5000) as previously reported151954. Purified Vt and Lp were employed to build calibration curves1454. For the assays the hemolymph was individually collected and directly processed for ELISA. Fat bodies were weighed and then homogenized in buffer Tris-NaCl (20 mM Tris 150 mM NaCl pH 7.4) containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors. The homogenates were first centrifuged at 2500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and the floating fat cake and pellet were discarded. The resulting material was centrifuged at 15000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and the supernatants collected and used for ELISA as previously described19.

Vg and Lp were also evaluated in ovarian tissue by immunofluorescence assays as previously described19. Briefly the ovaries from dsDmaxMet or control females were dissected out and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS transferred to PBS/sucrose and processed for cryostat sectioning54. Thereafter tissue sections (10 µm) were obtained using a Leica CM1510 cryostat (Leica Microsystems Wetzlar Germany) and placed onto poly-L-lysine-treated glass slides (Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis MO USA). For the assays the slides were blocked with 1% BSA 0.1% Triton X-100 5% fetal bovine serum in PBS during 1 h and then incubated sequentially as follow: anti-Vt antibody (1:4000) followed by a secondary anti-rabbit IgG antibody labeled with Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes Carlsbad CA USA); anti-lipophorin antibody labeled with FITC (anti-Lp-FITC 1:10). Slides were mounted in Fluorsave (Calbiochem Darmstadt Germany) and examined in a Leica DMi8 microscope (Leica Microsystems Wetzlar Germany).

Statistical analysis

The results are presented as the mean ± Standard Deviation (SD) from at least three independent experiments as stated in the legend to figures. Each experimental point includes ovaries fat body or hemolymph from insects processed individually (n = 3–4). Graphs and statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism 6.0 and GraphPad Instat 3.0. (GraphPad Software San Diego CA USA). The data were evaluated for normality and homogeneity of variance using the Shapiro–Wilk test which showed that no transformations were needed. All datasets passed normality and homoscedasticity tests. Statistical analyses were performed employing Student's t-test or parametric one-way ANOVA and using the Student–Newman–Keuls multiple-comparisons as a post-test. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant."

Photo / Mead Norton

''The hurt is coming.''

That's how one farming leader's prediction as the sector is hit by escalating costs that have eroded bottom lines while another says ''we are running to standstill''.

One fertiliser had skyrocketed to $1800 a tonne compared to $799 a tonne two years ago while freight labour feed farm supplies freight regulatory requirements equipment and machinery had all increased.

The dairy industry alongside beef and lamb had posted solid results in the last year with the farmgate forecast sitting at about $9 per kgMS but this was being offset by spiralling costs.

Federated Farmers Bay of Plenty provincial president Darryl Jensen said issues in the supply chain were frustrating and the price of fertiliser was ''horrendous''.

The Pukehina dairy farmer had been waiting two months for a small part for his tractor and products vital for calving were being ordered a season ahead.

The cost of fertiliser had more than doubled Jensen said while petrol was another big expense.

''We are running to standstill and while we have got these good returns we are not a lot better off.''

Te Puke sheep and beef farmer Rick Powdrell said in the past his fertiliser bill accounted for about 20 per cent of his budget and he expected that to increase.

Labour costs had also gone up but he was a firm believer in paying good staff well. Supply chain issues had also hit farmers and there were wait times on fencing gear and posts.

Farmers were resilient Powdrell said but some things had to give.

''You'll often find that it will be maintenance and capital expenditure. Farmers won't replace things they will press on with the old ute tractor or car.''

He acknowledged beef and lamb prices had stabilised although farmers were driven by prices.

''The realistic thing that consumers have got to remember is the more restrictions we put on farming [government regulations] the more productivity goes down and the less we will produce. That drives the world markets and food prices will go up.''

Federated Farmers Rotorua/Taupō provincial president Colin Guyton said the ''hurt is coming for farmers''.

He did not want to get out the ''violin'' as every Kiwi was hit by rising costs but the $9 dairy payout was really only equivalent to the $7 payout seven years ago due to rising costs.

Guyton said farmers had been around long enough to know the payouts could drop ''and will''.

''That is when further cost adjustments are needed so in that period of time farmers will be really really hurting.''

Often farmers were at the backend of a lot of price rises as they were the end consumer.

For example his feed bill had gone up by $130 a tonne which added $30000 to $40000 extra to the budget alongside fertiliser that had more than doubled.

Ballance Agri Nutrients said in a statement to its shareholders that the cost of nutrients had escalated significantly and further escalations were inevitable.

''The war in Ukraine sanctions on Russia/Belarus export bans lockdowns in China and the high cost of energy are all having a significant impact on both the availability and price of nutrients globally. In addition shipping is also significantly disrupted with port congestion due to Covid and the Russian attack resulting in escalated freight rates and disrupted schedules.''

It said in response to the supply challenges Ballance would continue to leverage long-standing international relationships increase order lead times and where possible contract purchase nutrients.

Ballance confirmed a tonne of superphosphate was now about $490 a tonne compared to $315 two years ago while Di-ammonium Phosphate had jumped to $1800 a tonne compared to $799 two years ago.

Beef and Lamb New Zealand chief economist Andrew Burtt said on-farm inflation was 10.2 percent for the year ended March 2022 - the highest it's been since 1985-86 [13.2 percent].

Since that analysis fuel has increased 23 per cent [from March to June] and fertiliser increased by 8 per cent over the same timeframe.

Farmers had also faced increased prices for contractors tradespeople machinery and parts for operating farm infrastructure and vehicles due to a tight labour market and increased import shipping costs he said.

Increased costs place pressure on farmers' ability to meet rising regulation and compliance costs.

''We are concerned increasing regulatory requirements from the Government such as fresh water and biodiversity rules will stretch farmers even further.''

A farmer's income depends on how easily they can sell their livestock he said.

''Meat processors have had labour shortages and backlogs all year which impacts timing for farmers and can impact prices received.

''With farm input costs outstripping gains from good market prices farmers will likely be impacted with lower margins and reduced profitability this season compared to last.

Exports from New Zealand's red meat and wool industry totalled around $11.2 billion for the year ended 30 June 2022 – about 17 pe rcent of New Zealand's merchandise goods exports.

Meanwhile pastoral agriculture exports made up 48 per cent of merchandise exports – the highest level since 2013-14 .

Dairy NZ chief executive Dr Tim Mackle.

Dairy NZ chief executive Dr Tim Mackle said farmers like all New Zealanders were feeling the effects of increased inflation on daily costs.

''It's challenging for dairy farmers in the current environment and we are seeing them take a range of steps to manage costs.

''Our regional communities and New Zealand continue to benefit from dairy's economic contribution. Dairy is forecast to contribute around $52 billion to New Zealand in 2022/23 [this includes direct and flow-on income to the economy including local communities].''

DairyNZ budget case studies of eight farms across New Zealand showed that over three seasons [2020/21 to 2022/23 forecast] milk income was up $1.19 per kg of milk solids.

''However farm working expense increases up $1.06 per kg of milk solids is eroding most of the milk price gain.''

The largest expense increases between 2020/21 to 2022/23 have been in feed crops re-grassing and grazing – up 52 cents per kg of milk solids. Fertiliser expenditure is up 20 cents per kg of milk solids he said.

Overall DairyNZ data indicates average operating expenses for farms including rent interest and loan repayment costs were forecast at $8.66 per kg of milk solids in 2021/22.

''To manage these issues farmers are applying less fertiliser are bulk purchasing supplements or fuel so they are less exposed to future price increases or are planting more crops to reduce reliance on purchased feed or supplements.''",,,,,,,,,,,,

Woods said he is most proud of Atrium Health’s mission to improve health elevate hope and advance healing for all. “It’s not about me” he said “but about the folks I’ve been privileged to work with and the communities we serve.”

The chairperson of Woods’ executive committee calls him a transformational leader.



“One of the things I appreciate most about him is his willingness to listen to feedback and suggestions” said Angie Vincent-Hamacher chairs of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Hospital Authority Board of Commissioners and partner at Robinson Bradshaw law firm. “It helps everyone rise to the occasion and be their best.”



Woods’ authenticity impresses Michael Lamach chairman of the Charlotte Executive Leadership Council and retired executive chair and CEO of Trane Technologies.



“The old saying ‘a kind of friend a friend would like to have’ captures Gene” Lamach said “and I feel blessed to consider him a dear friend.”



Like many of his friends Woods said Lamach wants to lift up the most vulnerable and that matches Atrium Health’s initiatives.



“We’ve made significant investments in affordable housing and food scarcity programs” Woods said. Atrium Health also works with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools and Johnson C. Smith University to expose young people “to the wonderful opportunities in the healthcare field whether it’s life sciences or innovation.”



“I’m blessed to call Gene a mentor and friend” said Kieth Cockrell president of Bank of America Charlotte. “He’s got a contagious smile and a very positive outlook. People run to that. He surrounds himself with really exceptional people.”



Before taking the Atrium Health job six years ago Woods said he shared with interviewers his belief that the health care provider needed to carve out a significantly different future. A huge step was forging a partnership to create a Wake Forest School of Medicine campus in Charlotte. Atrium Health and Wake Forest University executives “realized we were looking to do something magical” he said.



The effort’s leaders decided to locate the medical school on 20 acres where the historic African American neighborhood of Brooklyn stood before urban renewal. Then they planned for it to anchor an innovation district called “The Pearl” which will feature education retail apartments a hotel and open community space. It will welcome entrepreneurial activity and spur research and development.



“This is an opportunity to create some healing” Woods said. “We’re listening to the community and that community is going to be lifted up by what we’re doing.”



There is a strong commitment to supplier diversity and inclusion for construction of The Pearl.



“Ultimately good jobs and good opportunities help drive economic mobility of vulnerable communities” Woods said.



This spring Atrium Health and Advocate Aurora Health announced plans to combine and form a healthcare footprint across Illinois Wisconsin the Carolinas Georgia and Alabama. With Charlotte as headquarters the new organization will serve 5.5 million patients and employ more than 7600 physicians.



“We’re in conversations to build a national system with Advocate Aurora” Woods said. “That takes a decade to build out and do it right.”



At 58 Woods plans to stay on the job indefinitely.



“I don’t think there’s a better platform to reinvent healthcare promote education and drive equity than Atrium Health” he said.



The son of a Black Navy-career father and Spanish mother Woods has two grown sons. He spends leisure time with his guitar and for decades he’s written original jazz blues and rock tunes. He recently recorded a compact disc.



Lyrics in his compositions are a sort of diary for him reflecting his feelings and attitudes as he progressed in his career. Listening to his songs he feels: “I’m living my purpose.



I tell young people ‘find your passion’. If you know what your passion is you can outwork anybody. Chances are you’re going to be successful.”

Banyan Tree Group

Few luxury hotel brands capture the essence of the term ‘escape’ quite like Banyan Tree Group.

From there it grew into an independent hospitality group with a portfolio of hotels (there are 47 in the current pipeline) resorts spas galleries golf courses and residences in 23 countries around the world. “Recently we launched two brand extensions: Buahan a Banyan Tree Escape with its signature ‘no walls no doors’ concept offering an intimate stay experience in lush natural surroundings and Banyan Tree Veya designed to welcome guests on a wellbeing journey to connect with themselves others and nature” Ho says. The former was cited in TIME’s list of World’s Greatest Places within just a month of opening and other famous Banyan Tree properties worth adding to your bucket list include Angsana Corfu in Greece and Banyan Tree Vabbinfaru in the Maldives.

Viceroy Hotels & Resorts

(+) Viceroy Hotels & Resorts (+) Viceroy Hotels & Resorts INFO 1/2

Viceroy Santa Monica has been a staple on the coastal city’s iconic Ocean Avenue since 2000 when the luxury hotel brand first debuted. Over the years Viceroy has expanded globally with outposts in destinations like Los Cabos St. Lucia and Serbia. The hotel brand launched with Kelly Wearstler as its interior designer and has since collaborated with different designers and architects to translate the hotel to its unique environment. “For instance Viceroy Chicago is located on the site of a former historic Cedar Hotel at the heart of Chicago’s Gold Coast Neighborhood with sweeping views of Lake Michigan” Viceroy Hotels & Resorts VP of Brand Marketing Kelly Kang says. “We worked with Architect Goettsch Partners to preserve the four-story brick and terra-cotta façade of the original Cedar Hotel.” In Los Cabos Mexican architect Miguel Ángel Aragonés designed a breathtaking contrast between white concrete buildings and walkways enveloped by water that lead out to the sea.

Art is another pillar for the Viceroy brand. “We are constantly collaborating with an amazing community of artists to create site-specific works for each of our hotels through an artist series called A Canvas for Discovery” Kang says. “Through this we connect with local and global artists to create original work from painters musicians sculptors and photographers.”

Coming Soon: Viceroy will be opening their second European resort in Algarve Portugal in 2023. “Surrounded by nature and miles of lush green hills citrus groves fig and carob trees small farms and inland villages with cobblestone streets this resort will be a true expression of Algarve’s Mediterranean charm” Kang says.

Rosewood Hotels & Resorts

(+) Hôtel-de-Crillon (+) Rosewood Vienna INFO 1/2

“The history of Rosewood Hotels & Resorts dates back to 1979 when the legendary Rosewood Mansion on Turtle Creek first opened in Dallas” Rosewood’s Caroline MacDonald tells TZR. Fast forward to 2022 and their collection has grown to 30 hotels and resorts in 18 countries worldwide an expansion and evolution that MacDonald says is a testament to CEO Sonia Cheng who took the reins of the group in 2011. Among the more iconic properties under the Rosewood umbrella are The Carlyle in New York and Hôtel de Crillon in Paris. If you’re never stayed at a Rosewood it’s worth mentioning that the group is guided by their philosophy of ‘sense of place’ — meaning each property celebrates its respective location which means each hotel has its own unique look and feel (“no two Rosewood journeys are the same” MacDonald adds).

Because this approach opens up more doors for creativity it’s no surprise they’ve partnered with some impressive names. “We have been fortunate to collaborate with many amazing designers architects artists and artisans over the years including Tony Chi whose timeless stylings can be found at The Carlyle Rosewood London and Rosewood Hong Kong as well as Karl Lagerfeld who designed Les Grands Apartments at Hôtel de Crillon” MacDonald says. They also teamed up with Pritzker Prize-winning architect Jean Nouvel and artistic director Philippe Starck on Rosewood São Paulo “with a majority of the design materials both locally sourced and inspired by the country’s diverse culture” she says.

Coming Soon: Rosewood Vienna just opened its doors on August 1st (their first in the German-speaking market) which is situated in Peterplatz one of the most famous squares in the city’s Old Town. “Looking ahead to 2023 we are eagerly anticipating the debut of Kona Village A Rosewood Resort located on the Kohala Coast of the Big Island of Hawaii” MacDonald says.

Last Updated 2 years ago

Two major cruise companies have been applying different strategies to stay competitive in the cruise market and here’s what travelers should know.

Princess Cruises —the American cruise line owned by the Carnival Corporation— just introduced a new bidding program. The company will allow guests to bid for cabin upgrades on selected cruise ships starting September 6.

Norwegian Cruise Line on the other hand is currently offering 40% off all cruises and fly-cruises until August 22. The offer applies for all accommodations and includes routes like the Canary Islands from November 2022 inactive since 2017.

Both companies are offering great deals for cruise lovers but there are a few details travelers should consider.

Princess New Bidding Program

A few weeks ago Princess Cruises announced 47 itineraries for 2023 and 2024 and now the company is offering passengers the possibility to travel more comfortably with a new bidding system.

The new bidding program will allow guests to upgrade to a cabin with an ocean view a balcony a deluxe balcony a mini-suite or a full suite. Depending on their budget travelers will get to submit an offer from a certain price point.

John Padgett Princess President said: “Upgrading is a popular request from our guests and we’re pleased to deliver a process that lets them improve their stateroom category by making an offer that fits their budget and lifestyle.”

According to the information shared by Cruise Hive guests will receive an email with an invitation to participate. Bids will be priced per person but the stateroom will be available for two guests. After sending their bids participants will receive another email informing if their bid has been accepted and they get the upgrade or if it was denied and they just stay at their original stateroom.

The new stateroom upgrade system will be implemented on five cruises that sail from the US first: Regal Princess Ruby Princess Caribbean Princess Discovery Princess and Enchanted Princess. By October Princess Cruise Line expects to apply this system to all of its fleets.

The company is making its cruise experience more pleasant for travelers and finding strategies to create more inclusive programs. The cruise line also recently updated COVID-19 protocols and has removed vaccine requirements for most itineraries.

Norwegian’s 40% Discount

Travelers must act fast if they want to take advantage of this promotion. Those who have been thinking about sailing could have a great opportunity to book an itinerary at a great price. Norwegian’s 40% discount applies for all destinations until next Monday.

The company has also included its “Free at Sea” upgrade package —which costs around $175— and offers travelers great advantages like free wifi free guided tours unlimited drinks and more.

Norwegian Cruise currently has itineraries in Alaska across the Caribbean and the Mediterranian Sea. The vessel Norwegian Sun currently has 8 to 14 days itineraries that include the Canaries and stops at Portugal Spain and Morocco. Norwegian Prima another great ship from this cruise line has itineraries in 2023 that include transatlantic sailing from New York to Reykjavik Iceland.

The cruise line is also offering travelers airfare credit up to $300 per person on selected routes in Europe. All these promotions will be available until next Monday.

Competitive Cruise Lines

Travelers must decide which promotion is a better fit for their travel plans. And while the cruise industry seems to be going “back to normal” with fewer COVID-19 restrictions and more sailing routes available Princes Cruises and Norwegian Cruise Line have also recently canceled sailings.

Just a few days ago Princess Cruises canceled 11 itineraries due to staff shortage labeled “labor challenges” by the company. And this week Norwegian Cruise Line canceled sailings planned for 2023 and 2024 due to supply chain delays. Both companies have offered compensation for customers but might be an important factor to consider when choosing a cruise line service and promotion.

Many travelers prefer to use the internet to find new places and travel destinations that would add to their experiences. However today there is a growing awareness about how we can save our planet by making certain deliberate choices that help us save the planet. Hence many travelers today prefer to focus on sustainable tourism that allows them to travel the world without damaging the natural environment and the local economy. The concept of sustainable adventure travel relies on the framework of sustainable tourism and is being adopted by many adventure travel enthusiasts.

Understanding Sustainable Adventure Travel

While many travelers prefer to relax and unwind during their holidays many prefer to head out into the wild and do some fun and adventure activities. Adventure tourism is generally based on providing activities in natural and rugged outdoor locations where participants are in constant connection with the wilderness and nature. However as more people are becoming aware of sustainable tourism many travel companies and agencies are now offering sustainable adventure travel where they identify potential tourism attractions where participants can connect with nature and help local communities as well. This allows them to bring local communities into the tourism fold and help participants understand local culture and lifestyle. Various tour companies like KE Adventure promote the concept of responsible tourism and focus on sustainability commitments to help protect and conserve the planet.

Rise of Sustainable Adventure Travel

The world today is changing rapidly and so are the needs and preferences of travelers. Today travelers are more informed and aware of the climate and geographical changes happening on the planet. Hence sustainability has become one of the top priorities for many travelers that understand that tourism in many ways contributes to climate change and environmental degradation. As per the study by CarbonBrief.org the global tourism industry today accounts for 8% of the total carbon emissions and that percentage is rapidly growing.

Sustainable adventure tourism focuses on how travelers and travel firms can minimize the negative impacts on the environment while at the same time promoting positive economic and social benefits for local communities.

Also one of the reasons for the rapid rise of sustainable adventure travel is that a major part of adventure travel is about connecting with nature. Adventure tourism is about doing some physical activities connecting with the nature and environment and having an immersive cultural experience.

Sweden is among the top countries that run hundreds of local eco-certified tour operators around the country. This allows travelers to find more local tour operators across the country to get the best travel adventure packages.

Various adventure travelers prefer activities like trekking hiking climbing cycling snorkeling scuba diving kayaking paddling waterboarding and paragliding which allows them to feel the adrenaline rush without hurting nature around.

Furthermore many adventure travel activities are carried out in natural environments or rural and remote areas and therefore incorporating sustainability into adventure travel is easier and faster compared to other forms of tourism.

When it comes to adventure travel many travelers prefer to explore the culinary experiences of the local area for instance rural gastronomy and wine tasting and craft beer tasting. Travelers interested in sustainable adventure tourism also get to participate in wellness activities like local Ayurvedic massage and spa treatment yoga and meditation and even forest bathing. All these activities provide adventure travelers with the adventure that they seek.

On the other hand it also develops the local communities and economy offering locals stable employment opportunities As per the survey done by Adventure Travel Trade Association (ATTA) 65% of the total trip cost from an adventure package remains in the destinations visited. This is because local tour operators that hire local tour guides with knowledge of the local territory and history organize most of the sustainable adventure tourism trips. This improves the quality of life of local communities and people in the area.

Benefits of Sustainable Adventure Travel

Tourism is one of the activities that not only affect the economy of the nation but also the climate and social sectors of the country. Today many travelers are opting for sustainable adventure travel as they want to minimize the negative effects of the tourism industry on the climate and the global environment at large.

However there are 6 more benefits to it that you should know.

Saves Money

Now who doesn’t want to save money on their forthcoming adventure trip? Even if you have the budget to make the most of your trip you would want to optimize your budget won’t you? With sustainable adventure travel you can save your money because instead of a multinational chain of hotels and resorts local tour operators organize a lot of these tours and trips. These sustainable tours are budget-friendly and far more affordable than you would imagine.

Eco-Friendly Transport

While many people that prefer adventure travel generally prefer activities like hiking and cycling this is already eco-friendly. However efforts are being made to avoid the most polluting travel options like cruisers and aeroplanes and replace them with options that conserve nature. For instance the Maasai Wilderness Conservation Trust (MWCT) is now using an electric safari car in Kenya to tackle the challenges of climate change and greenhouse gases.

NELSONVILLE Ohio (WOUB) — For the first week of the season the Trimble Tomcats faced the Nelsonville-York Buckeyes for a Tri-Valley Conference showdown. Each team finished the 2021 season having won their respective conference title.

The Tomcats opened their season beating the Buckeyes the last four years and enter Boston Field looking to extend their win streak.

However with the help of the Buckeyes shutdown defense and impressive ground attack Nelsonville-York caged the Tomcats winning 16-0.

The first points of the game were rewarded to senior running back Hudson Stalder of the Buckeyes with just under two minutes left in the first quarter. Stalder would become a key player in this first game of the season after this 3-yard touchdown.

Stalder was a workhorse in the backfield for the Buckeyes tallying 10 carries for 45 yards and a touchdown.

Both defenses stepped up for the remainder of the first half. After giving up an early touchdown Trimble shut out the Buckeyes in the second quarter heading into the locker room down a touchdown.

With a one-score game both teams approached the second half with grit hungry to come out on top.

Despite a pass interference penalty against the Buckeyes Tommy Mitchell responded quickly with a fumble recovery with just under five minutes left in the third quarter.

With a blow of the whistle the Buckeyes started the fourth quarter hungry looking to make it a two-score game.

The Trimble defensive line was able to temporarily withstand the pressure forcing Nelsonville-York to settle for a field goal. Sophomore kicker Ben Perry secured three more points for the Buckeyes on the 20-yard attempt digging a two-score hole for the Tomcats.

Nelsonville-York thrived off this momentum applying seemingly endless pressure against Trimble. With the defensive line starting to crack Mitchell ran in for a 39-yard touchdown lengthening the divide between the two opponents and putting the nail in the coffin.

The Buckeyes look to continue this trend next week on the road against Newark Catholic.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The announcement Sunday came just less than two weeks before the Red Raiders play their season opener Sept. 3 against Murray State. Shough a senior in his second year with the Red Raiders after transferring from Oregon was picked as the starter over sophomore Donovan Smith and redshirt freshman Behren Morton.

“I first want to praise all three of our quarterbacks as this was an unbelievable competition” McGuire said. “Tyler has played well and put our offense in position to be effective consistently throughout camp which has earned him the right to be our starting quarterback. Tyler has a great football IQ and has really captured what we want this offense to look like with the type of responsibility we put on the quarterback.”

Shough completed 64 of 92 passes (69.6%) for 872 yards and six touchdowns in Texas Tech’s four games last season before breaking a collarbone. He had started 11 games at Oregon before joining the Red Raiders

Despite Shough being named the starter to begin the season McGuire has been adamant that Behren Morton and Donovan Smith will also see reps at quarterback.

“We fully intend for Red Raider fans to see all three of these QBs throughout the season” McGuire said.

“This is as gifted as a room as I’ve ever seen and I’m willing to put the depth of our quarterback position against anyone else in the country.”

Shough will be the starter on September 3 when the Red Raiders begin their season against Murray State at Jones AT&T Stadium.

The trio competed for the job throughout the spring and summer with McGuire and new offensive coordinator Zach Kittley overwatching the process for months. McGuire maintains that all three quarterbacks will play for the Red Raiders in the opener against Murray State at home on Sept. 3. Three of the Red Raiders' first four games of the season are at home.

Shough transferred from Oregon before the start of the 2021 season. He was named the starter coming out of fall camp by the previous staff and led the Red Raiders offense for the first four games of the season until a broken collarbone forced him out for the rest of the season. Smith stepped in late in the season to start at quarterback for the final four games of the year including a thrilling home-win over Iowa State and in the bowl victory over Mike Leach's Mississippi State program. Morton is a redshirt freshman who was four-star recruit coming out of Eastland High School."

“The feed mill will be a critical piece to our business operations and we look forward to seeing its impact across the United States and right here in Iowa” Noelle O’Mara group president for Tysons' Prepared Foods division said in a statment.

The new mill adds 69 acres to the company’s existing turkey complex in Storm Lake that includes grow-out facilities a research farm and processing plant. The company sources corn and soybean meal from around the region and contracts with about 70 farmers within a 60-miles radius of the Buena VIsta County seat to supply the majority of turkeys for its operation.

Company officials said the new investment allows its staff to use the latest technology to manufacture ideal formulated feed that consistently meets nutrient and quality requirements for optimal turkey health.

Tyson officials and commmunity leaders celebrated completion of the project Wednesday starting with a flag-raising event honoring the American and Iowa state flag. They then raised flags of the 22 countries where employees hail from.

Few can disagree.

The significance is profound for these governing long-standing HBCU sports entities founded over 100 years ago — Central Intercollegiate Athletic Conference in 1912 and Southwestern Athletic Conference in 1920. Corporate America and major broadcast networks have ignored or failed to recognize the economic benefit of affiliating with HBCU conferences.

For example State Farm Procter & Gamble United Wells Fargo Invesco QQQ Tyson Foods and Cricket Wireless are a few corporations that sponsored HBCU-related sporting events. Nevertheless the record with the three and four-letter broadcast networks has an underwhelming track record with HBCUs — for many a year.

AN HBCU GO-TYPE PARTNERSHIP 'LONG OVERDUE'

The SWAC arrangement with HBCU GO is a ""long-term partnership to amplify and grow the sports floor program"" Byron Allen told me. ""This is the long overdue support to help them get the exposure the revenue they need to help fund these programs the schools and ultimately the education of these kids. It's a very important deal and historic deal.""

For HBCU conferences history may point back to 2022 as when media outlets began acknowledging the value of partnering with the brands of Jackson State Florida A&M Grambling Southern Howard Southern or South Carolina State. Then again eradicating the years of disenfranchisement by the suits on Madison Avenue would require the commissioners presidents and athletic directors to make transformational decisions for these brands.

HBCUs have had three choices served to them over the years. One we won't do business with you. Two we will pacify you with a spattering of support - just enough to keep you quiet. Third the corporate boardrooms will invite HBCUs to the table and strike new lucrative deals.

Question. Are we there yet?

COMPARE OR NOT COMPARE THAT IS THE QUESTION

After this week's mega-announcement of the Big 10's $7 billion television rights deal with FOX CBS and NBC are the HBCU conferences on the precipice of leaping into similar long-term accords?

The media mogul remarked how he was ""very proud of"" inking the multi-year contract with the SWAC but would not disclose the financial terms of the new alliance. ""I can't share the details. But it is a long-term partnership that we are both [SWAC and HBCU GO] very excited about"" Allen stated.

One source told me it's a 10-year $120 million agreement between the SWAC and HBCU GO. I contacted the SWAC conference office to verify the details. A representative would only confirm that the SWAC signed a multi-year distribution contract with Allen's free-streaming platform.

Allen affirmed a few particulars from our first conversation in February 2022. ""We did a deal with them [SWAC] for over 2000 live-sporting events. That's football men's and women's basketball men's and women's volleyball other sports; it's everything the entire spectrum.""

HOW HBCUs WILL BE WATCHED WITH HBCU GO CBS

On August 16 Allen Media Group officially announced after signing separate distribution partnerships with the SWAC and CIAA that HBCU GO will distribute the conferences' content via CBS-owned-and-operated duopoly stations. Also HBCU GO has secured distribution with group-owned television stations including Nexstar Gray Cox Scripps Tegna Sinclair Lockwood Allen Media Broadcasting Hearst Circle City Broadcasting McKinnon Broadcasting Cowles Graham Block Sun Broadcasting Tougaloo College Sagamore Hill and Marquee.

""These games will be some of the very first games that will be on digital broadcast and cable simultaneously"" Allen noted. ""So this will be on the streaming app HBCU GO and the Grio streaming app Local Now SPORTS.TV and over-the-air broadcast. That's the syndication we've put together to align them for broadcast television stations with CBS being the lead group. Nexstar Gray Cox Scripps Tegna Sinclair Lockwood Allen Media Broadcasting Hearst Circle City Broadcasting McKinnon Broadcasting Cowles Graham Block Sun Broadcasting Tougaloo College Sagamore Hill and Marquee and our cable network. The Grio has 50 plus million homes available to 50 plus million homes.""

A few weeks ago AMG (Allen Media Group) acquired the Black News Channel (BCN) and its assets for a reported $11 million out of bankruptcy. Allen converted and merged BCN into The Grio. ""Anybody who wants to see an HBCU game will not have any problems accessing them via digital via over-the-air broadcast and via cable. It's 100% penetration across the board collectively"" Allen declared.

HBCU GO's IMPACT AND REACH FOR THE SWAC AND CIAA

The SWAC and CIAA grant HBCU GO the rights to their conferences' sporting events to broadcast via cable linear streaming broadcast VOD [video-on-demand} and pay-per-view. Syndication becomes a possibility for HBCU GO to be packaged in future deals for distribution on other networks. For clarity neither AMG Allen nor the SWAC verified with HBCU Legends that the conferences would or would not receive revenue from syndication of their content on HBCU GO.

Byron Allen mentioned the CBS deal would place HBCU GO in ""approximately 60% of all US households and approximately 67% of all African American households.""

The HBCU GO platform will have a global reach for HBCU sports fans to access games and events.

Even Jackson State's head coach understands how this will impact the families of the young men on his football team. Deion Sanders was very candid with Allen and told him ""We need some support. These young kids are here and they want their mamas to see them play. So we're help them to make sure their mamas can see them play"" Allen exclaimed.

ARE HBCUs NOW IN A POSITION OF POWER?

""We've gone from zero to now a deal has been done. Is it a multi-billion dollar deal? It is not. Have they [HBCUs] been there and available for over a century and decades? Yes. Have they been ignored? Yes. We are starting the process of reversing that.""

Allen continued ""The greatest trade deficit in America is the trade deficit between White corporate America and Black America. Why is it that Byron Allen in 2022 becomes the first person to take the sports content put it on digital broadcast and cable and push the conversation to provide distribution and economic inclusion for the HBCUs? Some pretty big corporations out there that didn't seem to care before now.""

He's correct. HBCUs are now sexy for the advertising agencies to seek new partnerships and promote the so-called ""black agenda"" to their clients' consumers. As compelling as it seems business and profitability must become the central concerns for the SWAC CIAA MEAC CIAC and other HBCU conferences and their member institutions.

Should HBCUs and their fans applaud these deals today later or at all?

It's not for me to say.

One thing is clear. Now is the time for the conferences to capitalize and take a position of power to dictate the new partnership terms. If they do not it will be same ol' business as usual for historically black colleges and universities.

In our conversation Byron Allen told me that Dr. Martin Luther King's widow Coretta Scott King once shared this wise statement. ""The greatest weapon we have is the truth.""

Will the truth set HBCUs free to control and navigate the economics of their media rights and future deals?

The only (presumed) starter on offense was rookie right guard Ed Ingram. On defense well they should have handed out rosters at the door.

Not that their opponent the San Francisco 49ers were any different. Trey Lance’s squad wasn’t interested in a nostalgic homecoming. He watched from the sideline. At least the teams had their starters dress up in their sports pajamas for warm ups so the early arriving fans got some small peak at the 2022 starters.

Welcome to the modern era of the NFL preseason. If you listened close you could hear Mike Zimmer’s blood pressure rising from northern Kentucky.

After the NFL canceled the 2020 preseason and football carried on normally after that there was no reason to put starters in ever again. It’s clear Vikings new head coach Kevin O’Connell would prefer that his starters stay healthy rather than showing them off to the public for three drives.

""Kind of planned long ago that we would kind of handle this week like this our game reps took place at our facility this week in that competitive environment that we were able to bring in"" O'Connell said referring to joint practices with the 49ers.

That doesn’t mean it was completely meaningless for the players on the field for the Vikings. Many of them might make a difference at some point and they sure as heck won’t be getting many legit practice reps after the third week of training camp.

The Vikings did their best to keep fans entertained having Sylvia Fowles of the Lynx blow the gjallarhorn and putting a brilliant sax player out there for the national anthem. Early in the game they put up a “Griddy Cam” and showed Justin Jefferson dancing. The kids in the stands danced along.

Backup quarterback Kellen Mond led the offense onto the field for their first drive with hopes of clarifying the muddy No. 2 situation. For a minute it looked like he might take command. Mond rolled out on third-and-6 and found receiver Bisi Johnson open across the middle for a 16-yard gain. A quality athletic play with velocity on the ball.

Mond’s fortune changed almost instantly though. After a 13-yard Alexander Mattison run (no trade requests please) the second-year QB got pressured by the 49ers and flung a Brett Favre-level risky pass to the sideline with hopes of delivering a brilliant dime for a touchdown. Instead the pass came about seven yards short of its target and was intercepted easily by a reserve safety named George Odum.

""Ultimately we've just gotta be better"" O'Connell said. ""I think in the end we're trying to see who can come of the bench and help us win a football game.""

The Vikings got a fourth down stop on the 49ers’ first drive but not before Nate Sudfeld made an impressive throw on a bootleg that was caught right in front of Lewis Cine. Starter Cam Bynum got the night off. Oh and yes Sudfeld is the guy best known for making the Eagles really mad at Doug Pederson when he played over Jalen Hurts late in a 2020 game so they could get better draft position. Ah memories.

With some energy in the building off the fourth down stop Mond threw an incompletion in the dirt near Kene Nwangwu and then checked it down to the speedy running back for a 1-yard gain on third-and-9. Don’t even think about making the joke that he’s trying too hard to emulate the starter. The Vikings punted.

They got the ball back after DJ Wonnum pressured Sudfeld into an incompletion. Mond’s luck wasn’t any better on his third drive. Former top draft pick defensive tackle Javon Kinlaw welcomed Ingram to the NFL and Mond took a sack. In total his first three drives produced 43 passing yards on 10 throws a turnover and eight yards lost to the Kinlaw sack. Kinlaw did the Griddy.

If we want to rub salt in the wound against non-third teamers Mond has been in charge of four drives in the first halves of preseason games and scored three points.

Mannion took over and immediately hit a bootleg pass for seven yards. Then he stepped up in the pocket and put his entire back into a third down throw and winged it behind an open receiver.

Brock Purdy came in for the 49ers. Mr. Irrelevant in the previous draft for those wondering at home. That went about how you’d expect and San Francisco punted.

Ihmir Smith-Marsette whose punt returning has been an adventure was stripped after a nine-yard return and San Francisco booted a field goal through to light up the scoreboard for the first time in the 2022 US Bank Stadium campaign. Of course they might have put up a seven had fifth-string tight end Tanner Hudson not dropped a pass in the flat.

Mannion got it together and completed back-to-back passes to tight ends Nick Muse and Zach Davidson. It was eye-catching that Ingram remained at right guard into the second quarter. We have already crowned him as the starter instead of veteran Jesse Davis but maybe now that’s less clear.

Ty Chandler had a nice five-yard run and catch out of the backfield. He’s the best Mr. Mankato candidate thus far.

Through his first seven passes Mannion averaged 2.9 yards per attempt.

The Vikings punted again.

The big screen showed a guy with a half purple and half gold No. 93 jersey. He had Viking horns a mohawk and moves that suggested it wasn’t his first time on a jumbotron. People got a kick out of that. At that point the first paper airplane came sailing down from above the press box. Last year fans became so bored during one of the preseason games that the giant voice guy had to ask them over the loudspeaker to stop throwing the airplanes.

Anyway T.Y. McGill and Patrick Jones sacked Purdy with just under 5:00 left in the second quarter. Players like them are the reason we are still doing this dance outside of the fact the league can make season ticket holders pay full price for these games. Jones has gotten a lot of second-team reps and the Vikings may end up needing him if Za’Darius Smith or Danielle Hunter have to miss time. McGill isn’t a future prospect but if the Vikings aren’t going to sign Ndamukong Suh they are going to need some depth players to be reliable. McGill has probably made the best case for a backup job with a huge game.

""He's one of those guys that flashed to me"" O'Connell said. He wrecked multiple plays tonight.""

On the same play as the McGill sack a demonstration of why everyone important was hanging out on the sideline: Rookie Andrew Booth Jr. stayed down on the field and three trainers came out to meet him. He needed their help to hobble off the field. Not that it isn’t concerning since Booth Jr. has potential and might be needed if there are injuries in the secondary but that would be far more problematic if it were a starter.

At the two-minute warning Mannion was up to 5.1 yards per attempt. Trishton Jackson an emerging contender for WR6 made an adjustment and snatched a pass out of the air for 17 yards and then he hit back-to-back 7-yard throws to Bisi Johnson and Smith-Marsette. The possibility of a touchdown didn’t exactly spark uncontrollable energy in the building but the crowd did react to the video board showing Brett Favre’s famous 2009 throw against San Francisco. Still unbelievable right?

It was announced in the press box that Booth Jr. would be out for the game with an ankle injury. He was the same second-rounder who said that he hadn’t been healthy since high school on his post-draft press conference. The Vikings have to hope this doesn’t become a trend because he’s very talented.

""It was kind of that same ankle he's kind of dealt with"" O'Connell said. ""It sounds like it's a positive thing from a standpoint of just an aggravation of an injury that we know about already. He's worked his way through that throughout camp.""

Ty Chandler update: The fifth-round running back plowed into the end zone to get the Vikings on the board with 1:39 left. He waited for a hole and then put his head down and slammed forward for the touchdown. The Vikings have a lot of good running backs. It’s hard to say whether this preseason will be enough for them to move on from either their starter or No. 2 after this year but the signs are there for Chandler and Nwangwu in the future.

That touchdown by the way was the first on a drive led by Mannion of the preseason. But he showed competency on the drive that has been difficult to find for Vikings backup QBs.

Harrison Hand and Nate Hairston came in the game at corner if you were wondering where the depth goes after Booth Jr.

McGill got after Purdy again but the former Iowa State QB actually made some quality tosses hitting receiver Malik Turner on third down for 21 yards into double coverage. Instantly a tweet came into my mentions wondering if Purdy was available for trade. Two incomplete deep shots later and the 49ers kicked a field goal to make the game 7-6 an absolutely appropriate score considering how things went in the first half.

A little kid flag football team came out on the field at halftime. The biggest roar of the day was when one of them juked out his mini opponents and scored a touchdown. The kid did it again a few plays later and hit the Griddy.

The 49ers started the second half with the ball and the most noticeable lineup inclusions were last year’s mid-round picks Janarius Robinson and Chazz Surratt. It appears the new regime isn’t interested in their services. Jaylen Twyman didn’t make his way onto the field until the end of the third quarter which may put him in line for a practice squad position rather than being a rotational rusher.

Purdy brought the 49ers to the goal line but fumbled a snap which was picked up by outside linebacker Luiji Vilain. He did not see second-team reps on Saturday night so he needed the big play.

Mond returned to the field for the Vikings’ first drive of the second half. Speaking of the 2021 third round there was still no sight of Wyatt Davis who was once touted as the future starter. Albert Wilson got his first look. He may be on the Kendall Wright or Jordan Taylor path of confusing offseason veteran receiver signings. Zach Davidson dropped a pass over the middle which has been a camp trend and the reason why Johnny Mundt and Ben Ellefson have gotten so many first-team reps during camp.

Sudfeld came back in at QB for the 49ers. The San Francisco running back Tyrion Davis-Price ran over three guys on one play and the third quarter ended with the 49ers on the move. Airplanes fluttered down from the rafters with more frequency. “Turn down for what” blared over the loudspeaker. The crowd largely remained the same from kickoff as the twilight faded outside.

Sudfeld threw a touchdown from the 2-yard line. The PA announcer needed a correction to get the receiver right and then somehow there was a timeout before San Francisco went for two. The Vikings left a receiver wide wide wide open on the conversion and San Fran went up 14-7 with 14 minutes and 57 merciful seconds remaining.

Mannion came back in to operate the offense and made the best pass of the entire preseason heaving a pass down the middle of the field to a wide open Davidson. He could have run all the way to St. Paul without being touched but the ball bounced off his hands and fell to the turf. Mannion should have seen his yards per pass shoot through the roof and instead got a zero in the box score. He threw another incompletion on third down and the Vikings punted.

The 49ers put the Vikings’ chances at a preseason victory out of range with a field goal to go up 17-7 but not before fourth-round pick Akayleb Evans made a strong punch at the ball to force a fumble.

Mond remained in the game in the final moments of the fourth quarter. He let loose on a deep pass into double coverage that was knocked away and then whipped a pass way over the head of an open Myron Mitchell. When Mond did send a good throw Mitchell’s way he let it slip through his hands.

Mond finished his miserable evening with another interception on an ill-advised inaccurate pass and a smattering of boos could be heard from those still paying attention. He ended the game with a 82 yards on 20 passes and a 21.3 passer rating. You could argue it was a step back after his fourth quarter showing last week but only if you thought that it meant something.

""The last interception I think he just lost track of where that post safety was and tried to press to make that play that we were trying to make all night"" O'Connell said.

While there may not have been a ton of highlight moments or major takeaways about the things that matter for the 2022 season the biggest development from the Vikings’ loss to the 49ers is that this might be the game we remember as the last fleeting moment of discussion about Mond as a trustworthy option right now.

Other than that the lack of starters and action made it hard to get amped about anything else from Saturday night’s contest.

Two men accused of robbing a Hillsborough County bank Saturday morning are now behind bars.

According to the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office a man entered the Bank of America located at 10301 N Dale Mabry Highway in Tampa shortly before 10:20 a.m.

Deputies say he jumped onto the teller's counter and then behind it demanding money from the bank employee.

After taking an undisclosed amount of money the suspect left in a waiting white Honda Accord according to HCSO.

Detectives linked the car to 48-year-old John Ward and located the vehicle at the Park on Waters Apartments at 2701 W Waters Ave.

Inside the vehicle deputies say they found large amounts of cash that matched the money stolen from the Bank of America.

Deputies say they also saw a man running in the area wearing only his boxers and a white tank top. The rest of his clothes were found at a nearby lake.

The Bank of America on Dale Mabry Highway was robbed on Saturday.

According to HCSO after talking to detectives 28-year-old Terry Zukowski admitted to driving the white Honda Accord during the bank robbery.

Detectives say he also admitted to driving the getaway car during the bank robbery at the Suncoast Credit Union on August 3 2022.

""Thanks to the hard work great investigative skills and quick response by deputies responding to the scene the two suspects were located and charged"" said Sheriff Chad Chronister.

Ward and Zukowski were both charged with robbery while wearing a mask."

Until Wednesday he'd never pulled over to rescue people from a burning building.

At around 8 a.m. Sam was driving a passenger from Brooklyn New York to LaGuardia Airport when he noticed people in pajamas gawking and pointing phones at walk-up in the city's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood. At first he thought the ruckus was caused by a fight but when a piece of debris fell from a second-story window he realized the building was in flames.

With his passenger's permission he pulled over to gauge the situation. And when someone said there were still residents inside Sam says a flip switched inside of his brain and he rushed into the smoke-filled property.

""I get tunnel vision in those situations"" Sam 54 tells CNBC Make It. ""I don't want to get hurt but when people need help I just want to do the right thing.""

Sam says he spent about six minutes inside and guided two residents by hand out of the building. One of them told them it was their AC unit that had caught on fire. She appeared to be in shock and hesitant to leave the hallway.

""I looked at her and said 'I'm not leaving until you leave'"" he says.

Firefighters entered the building as he helped a second person out. Sam says he spent a few minutes checking on the people he helped then someone tapped his on the shoulder and handed him his keys. In all the chaos he had parked in front of a fire hydrant and another passerby re-parked his car down the block.

He also had unknowingly handed his phone to someone standing outside the building. It was promptly returned.

""It was a matter of right people being at the right place at the right time"" Sam says. ""The passenger wasn't like 'Oh let's just go.' She cared too.""

The passenger a writer named Jemimah Wei tells CNBC Make It that she followed Sam onto the sidewalk and joined the chorus of people yelling to residents to evacuate. She says she was touched by Sam's ""strong moral compass.""

Ultimately Sam and Wei got back into the car and made it to the airport on time. Wei later tweeted photos from the fire commenting: ""People are good.""

The thread went viral.

Sam says he doesn't consider his actions to be all that spectacular. ""There's nothing special about me"" he says. ""I think this is in everyone.""

He says his parents owned a yellow taxi company while he was growing up and he once pulled over to check on someone whose car had burst into flames. ""I hope I never have to do something like this again but I can't say I won't"" Sam says. ""You'd be surprised what any given moment can bring out in you.""

On the phone Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi asked Sam for his story and thanked him for his efforts Sam says. The company issued a statement expressing gratitude for having ""such a heroic and thoughtful member [in] our community.""

Sam says he hasn't been compensated for his actions and he doesn't expect to be.

""In the service industry it's our job to take care of passengers and people"" he says. ""I think it's just in my nature to want to do small things that can make a big difference.""

NEW UBER FEATURES

Uber Charter is just one of the various new features the company announced earlier their year for both its e-hail and delivery services.

In May the company announced the launch of Uber Travel which allows users to reserve rides for each leg of their vacation itinerary in one convenient location.

“Just connect your Gmail account and we’ll do the rest organizing your hotel flight and restaurant reservations all in one place for a stress-free travel experience” said Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi.

Customers who use the new Uber Travel feature which is now available in the United States receive 10% back in Uber Cash on each ride they book.

Uber also unveiled a new Vouchers for Events feature which allows customers to create unique promotional codes that can be distributed to event attendees in order to cover their trips.

“Simply enter your event details the maximum amount that you want to cover and share your unique code with your guests. Guests will determine their own pickup and drop-off at a time and location that works best for them and you’ll avoid overpaying for unused seats” Khosrowshahi said.

Uber Comfort Electric a premium version of the Uber Green feature allows customers to request high-end electric vehicles like Teslas and Polestars so they can ride comfortably knowing they’re helping to combat climate change.

The Comfort Electric feature is currently available in Los Angeles San Francisco San Diego Las Vegas Portland Denver Seattle Austin Baltimore and Philadelphia with plans to expand to additional U.S. cities in the coming months.

In the world of Uber Eats the company announced a new Voice Ordering feature which allows users to quickly order their favorite meals through the app using nothing but voice commands.

Uber Eats at Stadiums allows event attendees to place orders at their favorite concession stands through the Uber Eats app and then skip the line to pick up their meal once it’s ready.

The feature is already available at various baseball stadiums throughout the country including Yankee Stadium.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL3ByYWN0aWNhbC1wb2ludGVycy11YmVyLWx5ZnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Start checking Uber and Lyft as soon as you land at the airport,"Given how frequently I fly I'm fortunate to live pretty close to my home airport. Normally when I forgo parking fees and take a nine-minute Uber or Lyft ride to Raleigh-Durham International Airport (RDU) it costs between $14 and $16.

As most frequent ride-hailing customers know though the price you actually find when you plug in a ride is not always what you'd expect. This was particularly true in 2020 and 2021 when driver shortages fueled a combination of long waits and often unpredictable surge pricing.

After a flight earlier this year I plugged my address into Uber as I walked toward ground transportation. I was surprised to find the cost at almost $40 for the brief ride. It was a similar story on the Lyft app.

I pondered going to get a taxi but instead decided to just wait a bit and then check back; I accepted the fact that I'd probably be sitting around for a half hour in hopes of overpaying by $15 to $20 instead of by $25 or more.

After just two or three minutes though I was pleasantly surprised that the fare didn't just drop by half ... it dropped right back to where I'd normally expect it. I paid a quite typical $14.97 for the ride home.

It's a reminder that the price you find when you plug a route into your ride-hailing app can largely be a snapshot in time. If you're hoping to save money there are a few tactics you can try whether you're landing at an airport or leaving a busy gathering.

Look early check often

A variety of factors drive the price you'll pay for a ride through ride-hailing apps like Uber and Lyft. Namely it's a supply-and-demand equation: If a lot of people are looking for rides and a relatively small number of drivers are available there's a good chance you'll pay more.

It's the reason you can end up paying a lot more than normal when trying to get a ride after a concert sporting event or at an airport after a bunch of flights just landed.

As I learned earlier this year the price can change dramatically from one moment to the next so one of the best things you can do is monitor the situation as closely as possible.

This means checking your Uber or Lyft app as soon as you land potentially while you're still in your seat on the plane.

If it's going to be a 25-minute wait for a ride this may be a good time to go ahead and book your ride (or at least once you're off the plane).

Checking early can both give you a good sense of how long you might be waiting for a ride — and thus when you might want to book it — and what the prices are.

If the fare is higher than you're expecting you may want to take your time heading to the airport exit refreshing the app to see if the prices start trending downward again. If you find a great fare it may be a good time to hustle to the pickup area so you can lock the good price in before it spikes.

Of course if you book your ride early it's important to be sure you have enough time to actually make it to the rideshare pickup area before your ride arrives or else you could face cancellation fees. So be sure to consider factors like how long it will take you to walk to the pickup area and whether you checked luggage before locking in a ride.

Consider other Uber Lyft app functions

If you don't think fares on Uber or Lyft are going to come down or if you're waiting and not having any luck you may want to consider one of the other functions the apps offer.

In addition to sharing and splitting a ride with a stranger — a more feasible option now than it was during the height of the pandemic — there are also ways to essentially de-prioritize yourself in the queue in favor of a better fare.

Namely Lyft has a ""wait and save"" function where you can delay your pickup a bit but enjoy a discount on your ride. This could be an especially useful option when you're still far away from the pickup area.

There are also ways to book a ride in advance locking in your price ahead of time. For instance Uber Reserve is available for typical rides as well as for pickups from dozens of airports nationwide; you can schedule it up to 30 days ahead of time and your driver will be alerted of your flight status. Be sure to check and see if the price is right before booking this way.

Bottom line

Even though more drivers have joined Uber and Lyft in recent months there are still times when you'll find fares far higher than you'd like when trying to get a ride from an airport. By beginning your ride-searching process as soon as you land — and checking back often — or using the alternative ride options the apps offer you may be able to ward off unpleasant wait times and prices.

But moments into his second ride his morning took a terrifying turn.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8yMC91cy9ueWMtdWJlci1kcml2ZXItaGVyby1idWlsZGluZy1maXJlL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAUhodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIyLzA4LzIwL3VzL255Yy11YmVyLWRyaXZlci1oZXJvLWJ1aWxkaW5nLWZpcmU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,An Uber driver passed a building on fire while taking a passenger to the airport. He stopped to evacuate the residents,"CNN —

Uber driver Fritz Sam is being hailed a “hero” by the company’s CEO after he sprang into action and helped evacuate residents from a burning building in New York City.

Sam was driving his passenger Jemimah Wei through Brooklyn to the airport around 8 a.m. on Wednesday when they came across a four-story brownstone on Classon Avenue that was on fire he told CNN.

Sam said he noticed flames coming out of a second-floor apartment window but did not see any first responders at the scene yet so he felt compelled to help. With permission from his passenger Sam parked his car and ran towards the fire.

Wei soon followed him and along with the help of other neighbors they began to yell “fire” to wake up any sleeping residents who were still in the building. When Sam asked neighbors if anyone else was in the building he did not get a definite answer so without giving it a second thought he ran into the building to check for any remaining residents he told CNN.

At this point the fire was still contained to a second-floor apartment so Sam was able to navigate the building with his mind set on evacuating any remaining residents before the fire got worse Sam said.

He located a woman on the second floor and a man on the first floor and accompanied both to safety he told CNN.

According to both Sam and Wei firefighters arrived shortly after the last resident exited the building. Sam comforted the residents and made sure they were OK before returning to his car to finish the ride he had started.

The day also had a happy ending for Wei who took to Twitter to praise Sam.

“On the way to the airport this morning and drove by a burning building my Uber driver LEAPT out of the car and INTO the building while the rest of us screamed at the top of our lungs for people to evacuate the first truck came we rushed to the airport I made my flight” Wei posted on Twitter.

On Thursday Uber’s CEO Dara Khosrowshahi also acknowledged Sam’s act of heroism on Twitter.

“‘I spoke to this Uber hero – he was thankful that someone helped move his car – all the while he was the one who ran into the building!” he posted.

Sam who’s a long-time Brooklyn resident and father of two said he has been driving with Uber since 2015.

He told CNN he’s glad everyone made it out safely and that his passenger was able to make her flight.

Authorities told CNN no one was injured in the fire and it’s currently under investigation.

Stephanie Fox a spokesperson with the Red Cross told CNN the organization is currently helping 11 residents who were impacted by the fire get back on their feet."

MENOMONEE FALLS Wis. (CBS 58) -- Menomonee Falls police are seeking help in finding the suspects involved in a retail theft at Ulta Beauty.

Police say it happened on Friday Aug. 19 at 1:15 p.m.

Authorities say the suspects are a male and female who stole $2895 worth of merchandise.

The female suspect placed the items in a bag and left without paying or attempting to pay.

Police say the suspects both fled the area.

Mary Dillon one of only 31 women leading a S&P 500 company before stepping down as the top executive at Ulta early last year will take over at Foot Locker for Richard Johnson who retires next month.

Shares of Foot Locker jumped 20 per cent to USD38.38 on Friday.

Dillon takes control of the company next month with Foot Locker relying less on sales at malls where foot traffic has plummeted and moving away from one of its most dominant suppliers Nike. Nike recently shifted aggressively to direct sales to customers.

Johnson who has led the company since 2014 will continue as the board’s executive chairman through 2023.

Ulta’s market capitalisation tripled under Dillon between 2013 to 2021 and doubled its number of stores and loyalty memberships. She created a partnership to get Ulta into a major retail chain and in front of potential customers who may have been unfamiliar with the brand.

Foot Locker posted its highest annual sales since 1994 in its last fiscal year as the pandemic eased potentially providing momentum as it expands its online sales platforms while opening more stand-alone locations. Foot Locker said it will maintain a presence in malls where their referee-striped sales force has been ubiquitous for decades.

It is diversifying the products customers see on shelves. Foot Locker said by the fourth quarter of this year it expects no vendor to make up more than 55 per cent of its product budget. Just two years ago Nike products accounted for as much as 75 per cent of Foot Locker’s product spending.

With Dillon’s arrival it’s also diversified its leadership. When Dillon stepped down at Ulta in March 2021 the number of top female executives in the S&P 500 dropped to 30 or about six per cent according to The Conference Board and its data provider Esgauge. That number remains low and a woman holding the top job in any publicly traded company is uncommon.

Dillon has served as the CEO of United States (US) Cellular and held executive and leadership positions at McDonald’s and PepsiCo.

Foot Locker also posted strong second-quarter profits on Friday that easily topped Wall Street expectations. The company has 2800 stores across 28 countries and reported USD9 billion in sales last year. During the second quarter it opened 34 new stores remodelled or relocated 24 more and closed 50.

It also owns over 500 Champs Sports stores and purchased West Coast shoe and athletic apparel retailer WSS in 2021 for USD750 million.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndvbWFuc2RheS5jb20vc3R5bGUvYmVhdXR5L2E0MDg5ODM5MS9rYXRlLXdhbHNoLXNraW5jYXJlLXJvdXRpbmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kate Walsh 54 Shares Her Skincare Routine and Go-to Products,"Every item on this page was chosen by a Woman's Day editor.

Whether she's playing an American abroad in Emily in Paris or bringing back her character Addison Montgomery on Grey's Anatomy Kate Walsh always looks fabulous. So when we had the opportunity we asked the actress to share her skincare routine — as well as her go-to workouts (weights and circuit training Pilates ballet walking) and self-care practices (meditation hanging out with her pets being in nature).

""I tend to have dry skin so I've always been mad about hydration using body oils and creams"" Walsh tells Woman's Day. She uses as a base for her face as well as . For her body she uses to address crepey skin. ""It's really incredible because it targets that specific symptom as opposed to just hydrating"" says Walsh who was recently named a celebrity ambassador for the brand along with fellow actress Jane Seymour.

When it comes to budget-friendly skincare products in her regimen she loves the ""super affordable"" ($15). ""I use it in conjunction with any kind of serum oil or cream for my face particularly to lock in the moisture."" She calls the ($29) ""magical"" for her dry skin in summer or winter. ""It's all about hydration"" the star stresses. ""I'm a big fan of basic and keeping it simple and that you don't have to spend a fortune on things to keep your skin hydrated and healthy and looking good.""

When asked to share the biggest lesson she's learned since turning 50 the 54-year-old says that by embracing change for her ""life gets better and better; I get more conscious and wiser.""

""This idea that we're supposed to stay the same or stay how we were when we were 20 to when we're 30 when we're 40 when we're 50 — that's just a fallacy."" Walsh stresses the importance of listening to what's going on with your body and making changes when needed ""whether it's skincare or haircare getting enough sleep or just the changes that happen or have happened physically [as you age].""

That's just one of the reasons she's partnered with  which she uses daily to combat dry eyes. ""It is something that's very common as we age. And just like the way I hydrate my skin and I take care of my hair and my body it's just this thing that I do for my eyes"" Walsh says.

Note: Always check with your doctor first before trying new eye drops.

She notes that ""no one really tells you what it's like to get older — but it's pretty fabulous if you go with the flow and make the changes that you need to make to take care of yourself. Every challenge in many ways post-50 has also been a great gift. It's just more information on how to take better care of myself and how to live well.""

My hair had gone through relaxers keratins and perms and I had all the hair products to protect it from heat damage or to maintain a sleek shine. But with the big chop understanding how my curls behaved fell and stayed hydrated was a lesson in trial and error — something I’m still perfecting today. Although knowing your curl pattern and how to hydrate it is beneficial another feature to consider is your whether you have low porosity hair high porosity or somewhere in between.

Following natural hair bloggers I had heard about hair porosity but I didn’t realize how much it could affect the overall outcome of wash day and curl definition. “Hair porosity is your hair’s ability to absorb and hang on to hydration and moisture” says Devin Graciano hair stylist and head of product development at Goldie Locks. She believes it’s important to test and understand your hair’s porosity level to accurately choose the right hair products for your hair’s current condition and in order to find the best practices when styling your hair to ensure your locks remain healthy.

Understanding hair porosity is great for all hair types but especially necessary for curls where coils and spirals make it difficult for product and moisture to travel from root to tip. Ahead TZR spoke to a few hairstylists to get the full scoop on determining your porosity and finding a routine to satisfy your hair’s unique needs. They are even taking out the guesswork by sharing their favorite products for each type.

We may receive a portion of sales if you purchase a product through a link in this article.

What Is Hair Porosity?

“Although heat damage sun exposure and bleach can alter the porosity the root cause of your porosity level is largely due to genetics” Jenna Spino stylist at Maxine Salon in Chicago tells TZR. Essentially each strand has an outer shell of cuticles that act like doors to open and seal in moisture. “Hair cuticles are like shingles on a roof or fish scales that sit perfectly on top of one another” says Graciano. The higher the porosity the more those scales are lifting and in damaged hair some of those scales are missing completely.

The way your hair absorbs and retains moisture can be placed into three categories: low normal and high. Firstly there is no porosity that is better than another — it’s just a more detailed way to learn how to manage your hair. Low porosity has cuticles that are very close together; while high porosity has cuticles that are spread out. If you find your hair is somewhere in between you have normal porosity.

How Can You Determine Hair Porosity?

There are a couple different ways to test your hair porosity. The simplest approach is with a clear glass of water and a couple strands of hair (because naturals tend to have multiple curl patterns throughout the head it’s best to do this with a couple strands of hair). Start by dropping the strands of hair into a glass of water. If it floats you have low porosity; if it sinks immediately you have high porosity. If it starts off by floating and then sinks over time you have normal or medium porosity.

According to Micaella Mosley curly hair expert and founder of Mila Rose Hair Care an alternative method to the water cup involves washing your hair and seeing how long it takes to dry. If your hair takes a full day to dry then you have low porosity. If your hair is almost immediately dry after washing it then you have high porosity. And lastly Michelle O’Connor expert stylist and Matrix artistic director suggests the cuticle test: Take a strand of hair and gently brush against it in the reverse direction to feel the bumpiness of the cuticle. The bumpier the cuticle the higher the porosity.

Tips For A Low Porosity Hair Routine

Signs of Low Porosity

Low porosity struggles with retaining moisture resulting in dry or tangled hair. “Low porosity is vulnerable to missing key hydration simply because it does not have access to enter the hair shaft and deliver those nutrients” Graciano tells TZR. Therefore you might notice product or shower water beading up on top of your hair. This is because cuticles are shut so tightly that the moisture cannot absorb.

How To Hydrate Low Porosity Hair

To combat hydration issues you’ll want to avoid oils like castor oil or coconut oil as they are made to seal the cuticle — working against your efforts to lock in moisture. Spino also suggests staying away from protein rich conditioners as they can cause excess product buildup. Instead look for “conditioners with honey or glycerin as they are natural attractors for moisture in the air and will better absorb into your hair” says O’Connor. For styling items invest in products that won’t weight your hair down think leave-in conditioners and sulfate-free shampoos.

As someone who goes through phases of low porosity I find that steam treatments or at-home hair steamers help to lift the cuticle so products and moisture can seep in. Graciano agrees saying “If you’d like to increase your porosity in a nonabrasive manner you can utilize heat and steam with your conditioner and or hair mask treatments to expose the cuticle a bit more than where it was without steam.”

Tips For A Normal Porosity

Signs of Normal Porosity

With a looser cuticle normal porosity is the easiest hair type to maintain as moisture penetrates with ease. “Medium porosity has a cuticle that is somewhat open or exposed like the scales have lifted allowing for key hydrating and moisturizing elements to penetrate the hair without escaping too quickly” says Graciano.

How To Hydrate Normal Porosity Hair

You can opt to either deep condition with a mask once a week to balance all the natural oils or ultra-hydrating conditioners on wash day to eliminate product buildup and replenish moisture. As for daily maintenance a hair serum or oil can be used for hydration and protection of the hair strand without layering itself and causing weight.

Tips For A High Porosity Routine

Signs of High Porosity

According to Graciano high porosity could result from the ammonia in permanent hair color via bleaching lightening and other aggressive chemical treatments — preventing it from holding water. “The hair cuticle is lifted and while hydration and moisture can enter it is hyperextended too much which results in hydration and moisture leaving just as quickly as it entered” Graciano tells TZR.

How To Hydrate High Porosity Hair

High porosity hair will need more acidic products to bring that hyperextension back down. Try deeper conditioners like the Goldie Locks Hair Mask that are not only hydrating but help seal the cuticle to keep moisture in. In addition for daily use work in an oil like Trademark Beauty Argan Oil Daily Elixir to restore moisture and further prevent dryness.

UPS is the largest package delivery company in the world but its fleet of brown trucks and the warehouses where they're loaded are almost all operating without air conditioning. Nearly all UPS workers almost 350000 people are covered by a union contract. The contract is the biggest in North America and expires next year. In negotiations ways to beat the heat will be a key issue.

""UPS hasn't been proactive at all on the topic of heat and that's going to have to change"" Sean M. O'Brien general president of the union said to NBC. ""By refusing to implement these safety measures the company is literally sending drivers out to die in the heat.""

Nicholas Gubell a UPS driver on Long Island told the New York Times he had a dangerous run-in with heat stroke and paramedics had to take him to the hospital. ""People are dropping like flies out here"" he added. ""It's very brutal.""

In a letter addressed to Marty Urquhart VP of Labor Relations for the Central Region of the United States Parcel Service the Teamster's union made some demands. The letter dated July 27 2022 asks for fans in every truck cooling neck towels water and ice in a consistent supply. As well as uniforms that breathe better in extreme heat.

Their requests are in direct response to rising reports of heat-related incidents. As reported by NBC News more than a dozen reports from employees and union leaders say that workers are getting sick being hospitalized and even dying because of the heat. As a result they're asking for safety measures to be put in place at the highest level.

""Left and right people are falling out"" Jeff Schenfeld a union steward in Dallas and UPS employee of 25 years told NBC News. ""Something is different this year. It's a lot more people.""

In a tweet shared by Teamsters for a Democratic Union drivers posted pictures of thermometers inside trucks reaching 121F.

""UPS CEOs would never accept working in 120- or 130-degree offices. Drivers shouldn't either"" the tweet said.

In a statement emailed to PEOPLE UPS said they made plans to ""support employee safety and comfort on the job"" in preparation for the heat wave this summer. Their measures included ""providing additional water ice electrolyte replacement beverages and fruits with high water content."" They also put plans in motion to distribute 260000 new uniforms with ""wicking dry-fit shirts and performance fabric shorts"" as well as ""making cooling towels available.""

The statement said that UPS has also been ""accelerating the installation of fans in UPS vehicles across the country.""

""UPS trains employees to work safely throughout the year focusing on the importance of proper rest hydration nutrition and other good health practices"" said spokesperson Matt O'Connor. ""We have meetings with our employees all year round and when warranted remind them of forecasted temperatures signs and symptoms of heat illness and to be aware of their own health conditions.""

The New York Times reported that government records filed with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) show an uptick in heat-related reports. Since 2015 more than 270 UPS and USPS drivers have been sicked from heat exposure with many cases resulting in hospitalization. Workers for other delivery companies including FedEx have made up dozens more similar reports. The Times also reported that Teamsters told them ""heat-related injuries illnesses and deaths among drivers are severely underreported.""

A UPS driver was pronounced dead after being found unconscious in his truck during a delivery in Southern California in July when temperatures in the area reached the upper 90s.

Esteban Chavez Jr. of Downey collapsed in his vehicle just a day after he turned 24 years old while en route in Pasadena according to KTLA. His family believes he died of a suspected heat stroke.",,,,,,,,,

As you'd expect you can earn United miles by flying with the carrier or one of its partners. However how you earn United miles depends on several factors including the airline operating the flight how you booked the flight and your fare class. Let's take a closer look.

Flying on United

Over the years United has changed how you earn miles when flying on United-operated flights. Instead of earning based on miles flown you now earn MileagePlus miles based on your ticket's base price (minus taxes). You'll also earn additional miles if you have MileagePlus elite status — the higher your status the more miles you earn.

Here's how many miles you'll earn per dollar spent based on your level of status:

General member : 5 miles.

: 5 miles. Premier Silver : 7 miles.

: 7 miles. Premier Gold : 8 miles.

: 8 miles. Premier Platinum : 9 miles.

: 9 miles. Premier 1K: 11 miles.

Here's an example of how this works. If you buy a one-way United ticket from Chicago to Des Moines with a base fare of $210 and $30 in taxes you'll earn 1050 miles as a MileagePlus traveler without status. However if you're a top-tier Premier 1K member that earning jumps to 2310 miles.

Note that these earning rates apply even if you're booked into United's basic economy fare class.

United flights also count toward earning Premier status though the carrier changed this process significantly for the 2020 qualification year. Instead of earning status based on miles flown you'll now earn it based on how many Premier qualifying points (PQP) you earn or a combination of how many PQPs you earn and Premier qualifying flights (PQF) you take.

PQP is determined based on how much you spend on flights and PQF is based on the number of segments flown on United or its partner airlines.

Flying Star Alliance partners

You can earn United MileagePlus miles when flying any of United's Star Alliance or non-alliance partners — but it can be a little tricky.

Suppose you book a partner flight through United with a United Airlines ticket number. In that case you'll earn miles the same as if you were flying on a United-operated flight: based on the base fare of your ticket and your elite status level (as detailed above). However if you book the ticket on a partner ticket stock you'll earn miles based on your fare class and how long your flight is.

Fares are usually booked on a partner ticket stock when you book directly through the partner airline. For example if you're flying on Lufthansa and booked on Lufthansa.com you're almost definitely booked on Lufthansa ticket stock. If you book through an online travel agency (OTA) like Orbitz or a credit card portal like the Chase Ultimate Rewards Travel Portal or Amex Travel these methods may book you on partner ticket stock.

You can verify that a ticket was booked on partner ticket stock by looking at the e-ticket issued after booking. If the ticket number starts with 016 it's on United ticket stock.

The mileage earning rates vary from airline to airline. So check your booking class by looking at your ticket or calling the airline. Then head over to United's list of partner airlines click on your airline and find the corresponding fare class on that list.

To figure out how many miles you'll earn just multiply the mileage flown by the percentage in the ""Award mile earnings"" column. As you'd expect fares booked in premium cabins generally earn more miles than economy tickets.

United elite status on partner flights

One of the best ways to qualify for United Premier status is by flying on long-haul premium-cabin Star Alliance tickets. As mentioned you generally earn around 1 PQP per dollar spent on United flights. However on partner airlines you can sometimes earn over 3 PQPs for each dollar you spend.

Refer to our guide on earning PQPs with partner flights to learn how flying on United's partners can help you qualify for United status. Just keep in mind that United requires at least four paid flights per year to be on United or United Express to qualify for any status level.

On tickets ticketed and operated by Air Canada ANA Austrian Azul Brussels Lufthansa and SWISS Premier members earn bonus miles (but no bonus PQPs):

Premier Silver : 25% bonus.

: 25% bonus. Premier Gold: 50% bonus.

50% bonus. Premier Platinum : 75% bonus.

: 75% bonus. Premier 1K: 100% bonus.

Let's unpack this by looking at a real example on a Lufthansa ticketed and operated flight. We'll start with United's earning chart for Lufthansa.

(Screenshot from united.com)

Let's say you're flying from New York to Munich. Your flight is booked in Z-fare business class meaning that you'd earn 150% of the mileage flown as per the earning chart above. The flight from New York to Munich clocks in at 4038 miles so you'd earn 6057 redeemable miles. The math looks like this: 4038 * 1.50 = 6057.

As noted above a United Premier Gold member would earn an additional 50% of miles flown giving them 9086 miles for this example. Here's the math: (4038 * 1.50) * 1.50 = 9085.5 which would round up to 9086.

To determine the distance between two airports use GCmap.com and input your departure and arrival airport codes. It'll then tell you how far apart the two are in miles.

Transfer Ultimate Rewards points to United

Chase Ultimate Rewards is a popular transferable point currency. Although there are many ways to redeem Ultimate Rewards points the most lucrative is to transfer points to one of Chase's airline or hotel transfer partners.

United is one of Chase's airline transfer partners. So you can transfer Chase points to United at a 1:1 ratio effectively turning 1000 Ultimate Rewards points into 1000 United miles. Ultimate Rewards has various other transfer partners including Air France-KLM Flying Blue British Airways Avios and World of Hyatt. This added flexibility is why we recommend earning Ultimate Rewards points over United miles.

Chase's suite of Ultimate Rewards-earning credit cards may be a better fit for your wallet. They have broader bonus categories than United's cobranded cards. So even if you only plan on transferring your points to United there's a good chance you'll come out ahead with an Ultimate Rewards card.

Here are some of our favorite Ultimate Rewards-earning credit cards that you may want to add to your wallet.

Chase Sapphire Preferred Card

Annual fee: $95.

Sign-up bonus: Earn 75000 bonus points after you spend $4000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening.

Earning points: The card earns 5 points per dollar on travel purchased through Chase Ultimate Rewards 3 points per dollar on dining (including eligible delivery services takeout and dining out) 3 points per dollar on select streaming services 3 points per dollar on online grocery purchases 2 points per dollar on all other travel and 1 point per dollar on all other purchases.

Card perks: Chase Sapphire Preferred Cardholders get a complimentary DoorDash Dashpass for a minimum of one year. Cardholders also earn 5 points per dollar on Lyft rides through March 2025. Points redeemed through the Ultimate Rewards Travel portal are worth 25% more.

The only downside to getting an Ultimate Rewards credit card over a United cobranded card is the benefits; these cards don't offer free checked bags priority boarding or other United benefits. The Sapphire Reserve does offer other travel benefits like a Priority Pass Select membership. Still United flyers may not find it as valuable as a United Club membership on domestic flights.

Earn United miles with Marriott Bonvoy credit cards

One of the Marriott Bonvoy program's best perks is that you can transfer Marriott points to the program's many airline transfer partners. You can transfer Marriott points to most airline partners at a 3:1 ratio meaning three Marriott points equal one airline mile. Plus you'll get a 5000-mile bonus for every 60000 Marriott points you transfer.

United has a preferred transfer rate due to the airline's RewardsPlus partnership with Marriott. As of the time of writing Marriott points transfer to United MileagePlus at a 3:1.1 ratio. This is in addition to the 5000-mile bonus we mentioned earlier so transferring 60000 Marriott points to United results in 27000 United miles.

Related: When does it make sense to transfer Marriott points to airlines?

To transfer Marriott points to United log into your Marriott Bonvoy account head to the Transfer Points to Miles page and click the Transfer Points button at the center of the screen. Then select United from the airline drop-down menu enter your United MileagePlus number and enter how many points you'd like to transfer. Click the Continue button at the bottom of the window to initiate the transfer and the miles will appear in your United account within 48 hours.

Earn United miles with travel partners

Beyond airlines United has a handful of other travel partners like cruise lines hotels and rental car companies. Here's a quick look at all some of these partners and how to earn with them.

MileagePlus cruise portal

The MileagePlus cruise portal lets you earn and redeem United miles for booking a cruise.

While the earn and redemption rates vary you can typically get around 0.6 cents per mile. This is significantly less than the 1.4 cents TPG values United miles. So you're better off using the booking portal to earn United miles on your cruise. It's not unusual to earn up to 45000 bonus miles per booking even on low-cost cruises.

Booking hotels with United partners

United has a suite of hotel partners too. You can earn miles based on your hotel stay costs using the United Hotels portal RocketMiles and Points Hound. Each of these online travel agencies (OTAs) lets you book and pay through their website to earn miles on your hotel stays.

Unfortunately you won't earn hotel points or get hotel elite status benefits when booking through these portals. We only recommend booking independent hotels and stays at hotels where you otherwise wouldn't earn rewards. Further always make sure to compare the cost of the stay with booking directly.

United also has a partnership with Villas of Distinction where you can earn 3 miles per dollar on luxury vacation villas.

You can also earn United miles when you book directly with a handful of United's travel hotel partners. Sometimes this means you'll earn based on the price of your hotel stay. Other times it means transferring points from a hotel program to United MileagePlus.

Here's a look at how many miles you can earn:

Hotel Earning rate Accor Live Limitless Points transfer at a 2000:1000 ratio. Choice Privileges Earn 250 miles per stay. Points transfer at a 5000:1000 ratio. World of Hyatt Earn 500 miles per stay. Points transfer a 2.5:1 ratio. Plus receive a 5000-mile bonus when you convert 50000 points into 20000 miles. Hilton Honors Points transfer at a 10000:1000 ratio. IHG One Rewards Earn up to 2 miles per dollar depending on the property. Points transfer at 10000:2000 ratio. Marriott Bonvoy Earn up to 2 miles per dollar depending on the property. Points transfer at a 3:1.1 ratio with a 5000-mile bonus awarded for every 60000 transferred. You can also visit united.com/MarriottBonus to earn 500 miles on Marriott stays that link with your United flights. Marriott Vacation Club Vacation Club points transfer at a 500:8000 ratio. Up to 40000 miles per member per year. Radisson Rewards Points transfer at a 2000:200 ratio. Shangri-La Gold Circle Earn 500 miles per stay. Points transfer at a 2500:2500 ratio. Wyndham Rewards Earn up to 2 miles per dollar depending on the status level. Points transfer at a 6000:1200 ratio.

: 1000 miles. Premier Platinum and Premier 1K members: 1250 miles.

United packages

United also offers vacation packages where you can book a flight and hotel; flight and car; or a flight hotel and car. Priceline powers this service. When I ran a seven-night flight hotel and car package search from San Francisco to Los Angeles it clocked in at just under $2000 with a compact car from Budget and a standard king room at the Sheraton Gateway Los Angeles Hotel.

By booking a package I'd get two free rental car days and 1000 bonus miles as a limited-time offer.

Earn United miles with other partnerships

While flying and using cobranded credit cards are the primary methods to earn United miles quickly there are also many non-travel-related MileagePlus partners. Here are some of our favorites to help you earn extra United miles.

MileagePlus Shopping

Like most airlines United operates an online shopping portal (MileagePlus Shopping) where you can earn miles for making everyday purchases online. Just sign up for an account and find your merchant on the site before making a purchase.

Starting at this portal rather than the specific retailer's site will give you extra miles on your purchases in addition to the rewards you'll earn using your credit card of choice. This can be a great way to earn 1 2 or even 5 additional miles when shopping online.

In addition MileagePlus Shopping frequently runs holiday and seasonal promotions. Keep an eye out for these promotions and use them to earn even more on your online purchases.

However we recommend using a shopping portal aggregator like Cash Back Monitor to see which portal offers the best return on your purchases.

MileagePlus X app

Download the MileagePlus X app to earn United miles on the go. Simply put you use the app to buy gift cards to select merchants. The gift card is available immediately and you can purchase it in any amount. When making a MileagePlus X purchase you'll earn a select number of miles per dollar.

Participating merchants include major brands like Walmart Staples and Panera Bread. Be sure to give it a look before you make your next purchase. One of the best things about the MileagePlus X app is that miles are awarded instantly in most cases. So if you're ever a few miles away from a redemption buy a gift card to a store or restaurant you frequent.

Best of all primary United Chase Cardmembers earn a 25% bonus on miles earned from MileagePlus on eGift Card purchases.

United MileagePlus Dining

Like most other domestic carriers United has a dining rewards program that's part of Rewards Network: MileagePlus Dining.

In short this is a shopping portal for eating out. Just sign up for an account and link the credit cards you use for dining. You'll earn up to 5 miles per dollar when you swipe a linked card at participating restaurants. These earnings are in addition to what you earn on the credit card you use so be sure to use one that offers a category bonus on dining purchases.

To maximize your earnings with MileagePlus Dining you'll want to get select status and try to snag VIP status. Becoming a select member is easy: sign up for the program and enable email alerts. Doing so will get you an earning rate of 3 miles per dollar.

Once you've made 11 dining purchases in twelve months you'll reach VIP status and start taking home 5 miles per dollar. If you don't opt in to receive emails from MileagePlus Dining you're considered a basic member (and will only earn 1 mile per $2 spent).

United's PerksPlus program lets businesses earn rewards on employee travel. Sign up for the program and you'll be issued a PerksPlus number that you your employees and your travel agent can add to work-sponsored travel operated by United All Nippon Airways (ANA) Austrian Airlines Brussels Airlines Lufthansa and SWISS. Your business will earn PerksPlus points based on the cost of a ticket.

You can redeem these points for United elite status for employees award travel certificates United Club memberships and more. You can use these to reduce employee travel costs or enhance your travel experience. PerksPlus points are earned in addition to the miles an employee earns when traveling so both parties win. Check out United's PerksPlus website to learn more and enroll.

Buy United miles

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

If you need United miles in a pinch you can opt to buy them from the airline. Unfortunately however it's usually quite expensive to do this. The standard price for United miles is well over 2 cents per mile which is rarely worth it unless you need to buy a small number of miles to top up for an award.

United frequently runs mileage sales that drop the cost of miles considerably. Even so you should only buy miles when you have a specific redemption in mind and have already found bookable award space. Be sure to compare the cost of an award ticket against the cash fare before booking with miles.

Bottom line

As you can see there are many ways you can earn United miles. The most robust approach is to use the above methods in tandem. If you use all of the discussed earning methods at once you'll unlock some terrific earning rates that will quickly get you within striking distance of your next award trip.

We recommend starting with a credit card to earn United miles on everyday purchases and then moving on to the other methods discussed. This will ensure you're leaving no miles on the table when you book travel and make everyday purchases.

To say the least it was an incredibly successful Western Canadian Baseball League season for the Moose Jaw Miller Express.

From their winning ways on the field that saw the local crew hold down first place in the East Divsion right until the final week of the season to the incredible fan support right from the opening game and their amazing run right to the final game of the WCBL championship series it was a season to remember in Moose Jaw.

All that success on the field translates into success off the field and Miller Express president Darryl Pisio couldn’t say enough about how outstanding the 2022 campaign was after so much time away due to the pandemic.

“We’re extremely happy with how things turned out this year after two years of being away from the game it was nice to get back” Pisio said. “Then it just built from there the players just kept on getting better and better and winning and winning and the excitement just continued to build throughout the year. So it was awesome.”

The Express finished their regular season with a 33-23 record and were only caught for first place by the Regina Red Sox on the second-last day of the campaign. That success carried over into the playoffs where they swept the Swift Current 57’s defeated Medicine Hat in three games and took the powerhouse Okotoks Dawgs to three games -- including a memorable Game 2 win in front of close to 1000 fans at Ross Wells -- before falling in the WCBL Final.

By literally every measure that’s one heck of a successful campaign.

“When you lose the last game of the season it's never fun but you take a step back a day later kind of reflect on things and you realize that there were a lot of amazing things that happened this year” Pisio said. “It's all attributable to everyone really from the players to the coaches from fans to billet families to sponsors volunteers you name it. It's nice just to see some excitement happening in Moose Jaw and everyone just embracing it.”

Fans also had an opportunity to enjoy plenty of upgrades both practical and cosmetic at Ross Wells Park just the start of what Pisio expects will be a host of improvements in the coming years.

All that work could have come with a hefty price tag but as per usual the Moose Jaw community stepped up. Businesses donated time money and effort to help with the renovations making Ross Wells that much better of a place to visit.

“There's a huge list that we can go through” Pisio said. “You have Cypress Paving helping us out with the paving and getting it done quickly for us. Elite Coating Systems and Rental Rehab helped us out a bit Western Lumber donated some supplies and United Rentals helped out with the painting as well. Then Sherwin Williams of course with their huge donation of paint. And Strictly Fences did some great work too.

“So it comes down to the fact that you just have an entire community behind you wanting to help out in any way. And it even leads into Homestand 2022 happening on Sept. 10 last year River Street Promotions had some of the proceeds go to Ross Wells and they’re doing the same this year. All those things have greatly helped. And it just speaks volumes of the people in Moose Jaw wanting to embrace and support it.”

Even better news? It’s just a start with consultation coming up soon that could make things even better for 2023.

“There's a lot of people that use the diamonds and the park and we’ll be talking to [Ross Wells board president] Charlie Meacher about what he would like to see done next” Pisio said. “I know that the lighting is probably a big thing that needs to get completed that will be back in the city's hands to hopefully help with that. But right now it's just one small step at a time and we're moving in the right direction which is awesome.”

Then there are the team finances. With the amount of support the Miller Express had from fans this year including several games that cracked the 750 mark in attendance Pisio wouldn’t be surprised to see things turn out well on the ledger book this season.

We asked AI to write a poem about Nevada. Here’s what it said

Nevada has the highest percentage of one-star acute-care hospitals of any state the lowest rating given by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

The state has a single five-star hospital Renown South Meadows Medical Center in Reno placing Nevada 12th worst for percentage of top-rated facilities according to a data analysis by the Review-Journal.

The rating system is intended to capture the quality of care by measuring death rate safety of care readmission patient experience and timely and effective care a Medicare spokesperson said.

Six of the 14 major acute-care hospitals in the Las Vegas metropolitan area were given a single star in the annual ratings published by the federal agency in late July.

“The fact that we have so many one-star hospitals means we have a lot of work to do” Dr. Marc Kahn dean of the Kirk Kerkorian School of Medicine at UNLV said on Thursday.

The highest rating for a Las Vegas metro hospital was three stars given to four hospitals out of the area’s 14.

The ratings do not “necessarily indicate the public should avoid certain facilities or travel outside of their immediate area to receive care” the Medicare spokesperson said in an email. Instead they provide information for consumers to weigh in their decision-making.

Nationally the one-star category has the fewest number of hospitals with 174. There are 627 with two stars 793 with three 766 with four and 385 with five.

The Review-Journal’s analysis excluded military hospitals and Washington D.C. which has just six hospitals three of which are rated as one-star.

An imperfect system

Las Vegas-area hospitals as well as national and state hospital associations emphasized that the star ranking system has its limitations.

“The Star Rating system does not accurately reflect the world-class care delivered by our team members across UMC” said Scott Kerbs a representative of county hospital University Medical Center which received a one-star rating.

“As Nevada’s only Level I Trauma Center Verified Burn Center and Transplant Center UMC cares for many of our community’s most critically ill and injured patients but unfortunately the Star Rating system does not account for patient demographics the overall complexity of cases treated and UMC’s status as a safety net hospital” Kerbs wrote in an email.

A representative of the American Hospital Association stressed that the ratings may be affected by factors beyond the control of a hospital.

For example readmission to a hospital can occur because a patient receives inadequate recovery support after discharge which could include a lack of transportation to get to appointments or inadequate nutrition said Akin Demehin the hospital association’s senior director of policy.

Kahn noted that when discharged patients don’t have a primary care physician they may resort to using a hospital emergency room for care which may increase readmission rates. The medical school he said is playing a role in expanding the network of primary care physicians in the community.

Hospitals respond

A frequent criticism of hospital rating systems is that a hospital that receives a low grade from one system can receive accolades from another. Las Vegas hospitals echoed this sentiment.

“We are proud of our hardworking team members who have worked tirelessly to provide kind compassionate high-quality clinical care in our ERs nursing units and outpatient centers” said a representative of the Valley Health System three of whose hospitals received one star and three two stars. Valley Health System is affiliated with Universal Health Services.

“Thanks to their diligence and expertise we have received many recent quality-related accomplishments including awards from 2022-2023 US News and World Report in five different categories the Spring 2022 Leapfrog patient safety awards and earning accreditations from The Joint Commission and the American Heart Association in the areas of stroke and heart care” representative Gretchen Papez wrote in an email.

The Valley Health System’s Valley Spring Valley and Centennial Hills hospitals received one star.

“We recognize the importance of measuring and public reporting of quality performance and safety and we work diligently to continually improve” said Marissa Mussi a representative of Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center which was rated as one-star. She noted that Sunrise had been rated one of America’s 250 Best Hospitals in 2022 by Healthgrades among other distinctions.

The two other hospitals in the Sunrise Health System which is affiliated with Hospital Corporation of America received three stars: Southern Hills and MountainView.

Hospital representatives said that all information should be considered when evaluating hospitals noting too that some data is out-of-date.

“We trust many of the various grades and ratings that are posted throughout each year” St. Rose Dominican hospitals representative Gordon Absher said in an email. “However quality rating initiatives do not always accurately reflect our current performance or quality. Results often lag behind lengthy reporting processes and don’t necessarily reflect more recent improvement data.”

Two St. Rose campuses San Martin and de Lima received three stars. The Siena campus received one star.

Hospital representatives encouraged patients to take into account more than just data when evaluating a hospital.

“When making health care decisions patients should use all available tools at their disposal such as talking with friends and family and consulting with doctors nurses and other health care providers” Marissa Brown director of workforce and clinical services for the Nevada Hospital Association said in a statement.

Important metrics

Kahn emphasized that the ratings are a useful tool for patients hospitals and communities. “Hospitals need to take these ratings seriously” he said. “Most of the metrics are important and they’re important for hospitals. So I think what we do is we use these to be better at what we do. … As a new medical school we see part of our responsibility as to improve the level of care that we provide our community.”

He continued “We all need to work together to improve those things. That’s really what this is telling us.”

If you haven't subscribed yet you can do that by clicking here.

The current staffing crisis in health care has reignited debate over privatization of the Canadian system — and while more needs to be done to take the pressure off hospitals critics say more private care is not a ""simple solution.""

This week Ontario Health Minister Sylvia Jones revealed a plan to help stabilize the province's health-care system that included increasing the number of publicly funded surgeries performed at existing private clinics though she declined to provide details on which specific facilities would be involved or which surgeries would be covered.

""Health care will continue to be provided to the people of Ontario through the use of your OHIP card"" she said at a news conference ​​Thursday declining to answer a question about whether she would consider allowing more private clinics in the province.

Depending on who you ask increased privatization is either a growing threat or a possible solution to the staffing crisis being felt across the country.

Yet for-profit clinics for surgeries and other medical practices have existed to varying degrees across Canada for decades and commercial agencies have been quietly filling staffing shortages during the pandemic — at a growing cost to hospitals and taxpayers.

Proponents argue some privatization would take pressure off the public system and better triage care while those opposed worry it would siphon off resources and increase inequity among Canadians.

""Right now we find ourselves in a really challenging situation because the health-care system is currently not functioning well — and I think that's becoming more apparent day by day"" said Dr. Katharine Smart president of the Canadian Medical Association (CMA).

""Privatization always is one of the things that people bring up in that conversation"" she said. ""But I think what we really need to be considering is how would that actually improve service delivery for Canadians to suddenly have a private for-profit model?""

Private clinics aim to fill gaps in care

Canada is facing a critical shortage of family doctors  with millions of Canadians without access to primary care because of retiring physicians and fewer medical school grads choosing the specialty due to a lack of resources and high overhead costs.

The pandemic has also exacerbated a lack of access to emergency care and increased wait times for surgery with close to 600000 fewer surgeries performed between March 2020 and December 2021 compared to 2019 according to the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) .

Almost half of adults across Canada's 10 provinces had difficulty accessing health care in 2020 and 2021 while close to 15 per cent said they didn't receive the care they needed at all according to a 2021 survey from Statistics Canada.

WATCH | What's behind the shortage of family doctors in Canada?

What's behind the shortage of family doctors in Canada? Duration 6:53 Family physicians Dr. Kamila Premji and Dr. Rita McCracken discuss the shortage of family doctors in Canada and what can be done to ease the situation.

Private clinics have moved in to try to fill that gap in some provinces including Quebec and Nova Scotia . Others are pushing back against the notion of offering more private health care.

In British Columbia the province's highest court recently upheld a lower court's dismissal of a Vancouver surgeon 's challenge of the Medicare Protection Act ruling that bans on extra billing and private insurance do not violate charter rights.

As it stands Canada's health-care spending is divided between the public and private sector at roughly a 75-25 split and at a cost of about $6666 per Canadian according to CIHI . Private health-care services are paid for by patients primarily out of pocket as well as through private insurance.

The country was projected to spend more than $300 billion on health care in 2021 which represents nearly 13 per cent of the GDP. That puts Canada roughly on par with other wealthy countries . (The United States spends the most on health care of any country in the OECD.)

Dr. Adam Hofmann is owner of Algomed which has private clinics in Quebec and Nova Scotia where it charges clients a subscription fee of $22 per month out of pocket plus $20 per visit. Hofmann said while he was once a staunch defender of a publicly funded health-care system he now believes private clinics are part of the solution.

""A large number of patients that end up in the emergency room are there for conditions that can be treated or prevented in an outpatient primary care clinic"" he told CBC's The House . ""And these patients almost universally don't have access to primary care.""

These kinds of private options should be explored on a broader scale as Canada seeks to solve its health-care challenges said Janice MacKinnon a professor of public policy at the University of Saskatchewan and a former provincial finance minister.

""We have to do everything we can to make the system more effective more cost effective and more accessible to people"" she told The House adding that other countries particularly in Europe have developed models where both public and private systems can co-exist.

""No government is saying: We don't want to fix the public system we want to create a separate one. They're saying we need to fix the public system and we see private options as a way to do that.""

Privatization 'not a simple solution'

Colleen Flood a research chair in health law and policy and professor at the University of Ottawa has looked at health-care systems around the world and she says private care tends to make access more difficult for low-income residents.

Flood described privatization as a ""zombie solution"" that we ""pull out all the time instead of focusing on how to fix the public health-care system.""

""It's not a simple solution"" she said. ""Countries that have public-private systems they spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to regulate the private [sector] so that it doesn't absorb all the resources from the public health-care system.""

In general she explained private clinics tend to target less complicated procedures — such as knee and hip surgeries — but the public system is still relied upon for emergency services and complex treatments for conditions like cancer and heart disease.

""So you are diverting labour … not only to the relatively small percentage of the population that can pay for that or have private insurance"" she said ""but you're also diverting them from really important care.""

Ontario's plan to fund private clinics with public money could potentially be a more efficient way to provide service depending on the cost which is ultimately footed by taxpayers said Maude Laberge a professor in health economics at Laval University in Quebec City.

""That's a negotiation aspect between the government and those clinics"" she said. ""As long as the patient doesn't have to pay.… If a clinic can do something really well — as well as it's done in the hospital or in the public — then there's no problem with having such private specialized clinics. If the patient has to pay then it brings equity issues.""

Hiring staff from private temp agencies hasn't seemed to solve the crisis in Ontario where some hospitals have paid millions more to such firms to help staff intensive care units and emergency rooms at an hourly rate more than double that of unionized nurses as first reported by the Toronto Star this week.

""Where's the stewardship for our tax dollars?"" said Dr. Michael Warner critical care medical director at Toronto's Michael Garron Hospital. ""And then what is that money not being spent on because it's being spent on nurses?""

WATCH | Critics sound alarm over Ontario's reliance on private nursing agencies:

Critics raise alarms over Ontario’s reliance on private nurse agencies Duration 2:03 With a shortage of nurses in Ontario hospitals are increasingly relying on temporary agency nurses to help fill the gap. Critics are raising concerns that public dollars are going to these private agencies instead of toward better wages for nurses.

Toronto's University Health Network (UHN) spent just over $1 million to hire nurses from various agencies in 2018 — but that increased to more than $6.7 million in 2022 alone more than $4 million of which was tied to hiring private nurses to work in its ICUs.

""What we've seen during COVID is that these agencies are charging much more and I'm not sure where their money is coming from but hospitals are paying much higher hourly rates"" said Warner. ""What they've done during the pandemic has been predatory and exploitative.""

Transforming the public system?

Those in favour of privatization say the Canadian health-care system desperately needs to be open to new ideas with Jones Ontario's health minister saying last week that Ontarians should not be afraid of ""innovation.""

But critics say there is little evidence to suggest the situation is improving with the private services we already have —despite costing considerably more — or that more of it will help.

""While there may be ways to improve the system for sure with innovation … we have to be clear on what exactly that we're privatizing and how that's going to cost less and deliver better outcomes"" Warner said.

""It makes more sense to transform the public system than to nibble around the edges with private health care.""

The CMA's Smart said previous examples of private companies delivering health care in Canada ""skim off the easiest most simplistic"" areas and fall short of developing an ongoing meaningful relationship between the patient and doctor.

""It doesn't do anything for patients who have chronic and complex needs; it doesn't do anything for patients who may be having challenges because of social determinants of health"" she said. ""Those people are left behind for an under-resourced public system.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN0dm5ld3MuY2EvaGVhbHRoL2ktdGhvdWdodC1pLW1pZ2h0LWRpZS1hdC1ob21lLWNhbmFkYS1zLWhlYWx0aC1jYXJlLXN5c3RlbS1pcy1jcnVtYmxpbmctZXhwZXJ0cy1zYXktMS42MDM2NjI40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'I thought I might die at home': Canada's health-care system is crumbling experts say,"For 36 hours Liz LeClair suffered through excruciating abdominal pain and vomiting in her home in Dartmouth N.S. with no ambulance coming to help.

Her ordeal is just one example of how Canada's health care system hugely overburdened and struggling amid worker shortages needs desperate attention experts say.

When LeClair was hit with escalating pain earlier this month she called the province's virtual health line.

""My signs and symptoms were symptomatic of possibly a bowel obstruction of some kind"" she told CTV News.

But she was told it would be nine hours before she could speak to a nurse.

She called 911 and waited more than two hours for an ambulance. None arrived.

Eventually she was told the wait to see an ER doctor was currently up to 16 hours.

So she did the only thing she could — praying her symptoms would simply subside as family members cared for her at home.

Her experience is far from unique.

Across the country Canadians have been struggling with inflated wait times at hospitals closed emergency departments shrinking access to ambulances and long-term care among other impacts as the health-care system limps along.

Experts say that drastic action needs to be taken to aid health-care workers.

""We don't have enough doctors or nurses to be able to take care of all the Nova Scotians and Canadians that need access to care"" Dr. Leisha Hawker president of Doctors Nova Scotia told CTV News.

Doctors and nurses coast to coast are saying they can't keep up with the demand. Morale is at an all-time low according to Tim Guest president of the Canadians Nurses Association.

""I would say that nurses are exhausted they're burnt out they're demoralized"" he told CTV News.

In B.C. health experts cite burnout low pay and mental health challenges as reasons fewer ambulances are on the road.

In some parts there aren't any.

Troy Clifford president of Ambulance Paramedics of B.C. said a marked lack of ambulances is now happening ""every day of the week.""

""It's not just isolated to weekends and nights and that's really putting a strain on the system and affecting our patients"" he told CTV News.

In Ontario the provincial government recently announced that they would be expanding some surgeries into private clinics in an attempt to address backlogs a troubling move that experts are worried could lead to increased privatization as a way to avoid actually fixing the public health care system.

Ontario Nurses Assocation (ONA) president Cathryn Hoy said in a press release that shifts into privatization ""will only line the pockets of investors nothing more.""

She added: ""The evidence is clear: health-care privatization provides worse health outcomes to our patients and has much higher overhead costs which will be paid by taxpayers.""

Earlier this month ONA called for the province's Bill 124 to be repealed stating that its suppression of wages and benefits for nurses is exacerbating staffing shortages by making it impossible for nurses to support themselves.

In northern Manitoba at the hospital in Lynn Lake at least eight patients have been transferred more than eight hours away to Flin Flon because of staffing shortages forcing the closure of all long-term care beds.

Families were only given a 24-hour notice.

A sudden transfer like this means that many families won't be able to visit their loved ones according to Lynn Lake city councillor Victoria Phillips.

""There are a lot of families that live in the area that are senior may not drive that do not have the means to have their own personal vehicle so it's really causing a lot of heartache"" she said.

One of those eight patients died two weeks later.

""She definitely would have been alone"" Phillips said. ""I don't think her family would be able to get there in time.""

In a statement tonight the Canadian Medical Association president pointed to decades of disjointed and siloed decisions as reasons for the health-care system's current state.

He says he hopes to see tangible solutions in this week's meetings between the premiers of Ontario New Brunswick Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island to resolve this crisis.

A previous statement from CMA in July stated that increased federal funding was needed to address the complex interweaving issues.

""We encourage the federal government to swiftly meet with the provinces and territories to resolve funding issues and develop real solutions to address systemic challenges that require immediate action"" the July statement reads.

Fortunately for LeClair her symptoms did subside after more than a day of debilitating pain. But she's haunted by the idea that if things had gotten suddenly worse there might not have been help available.

Decrying the power of the “oligarchy that runs this country” 80-year-old Sen. Bernie Sanders told thousands attending a pro-labor rally on Independence Mall that “we are in the fight of our lifetimes.”

To applause from the friendly audience in a campaign-style speech Sanders attacked the concentration of wealth in the nation the spiraling pay of chief executives the crushing weight of college debt and the lack of universal health care.

Sanders an independent senator from Vermont who sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 and 2020 told the crowd gathered between Independence Hall and the National Constitution Center that the country was saddled with the largest inequities in income and wealth in 100 years.

“You are not just a cog in a machine. You’re a human being with some rights” Sanders said. “If we are going to save the middle class in this country we are going to have to grow the union movement.”

The Vermont senator wore a baseball cap of the area’s Teamsters Local 107 for shade during the hot afternoon.

He was joined at the rally by two stars among labor leaders — Sean O’Brien the insurgent who became the national president of the Teamsters in March and Sara Nelson president of the Association of Flight Attendants. Nelson urged the audience to support a unionization drive at Delta the only major airline to have a nonunion workforce of flight attendants.

The trio are to appear at a similar rally in Boston on Sunday and previously held one in Chicago in June.

Their tour comes as the long-besieged labor movement has notched some wins of late.

The Republic of Maldives has made remarkable socioeconomic progress during the past two decades and is now an upper middle-income country. Notable achievements have been made in the health sector particularly the increase in life expectancy improvement of infant child and maternal health control of communicable diseases including elimination of diseases such as malaria measles and lymphatic filariasis and high rates of immunization coverage.

Despite these triumphs the country continues to face new challenges such as growing rates of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) accounting for more than 80% of total deaths demand for better quality services heavy reliance on expatriate health professionals limited health access for the increasing migrant population and vulnerability to the impact of climate change.

With the high prevalence of Cancer in the country the Government of Maldives is currently working to establish a specialized hospital to provide comprehensive care for cancer patients. To address and overcome these hurdles WHO supported Ministry of Health with a team of local and international experts to review the NCD interventions in health services focusing on primary health care review the status of cancer prevention diagnosis management and monitoring develop a package of NCD services conceptualize and plan a service delivery model for integration develop a monitoring and evaluation system for PHC and lastly to propose a strategic plan for addressing cancer prevention early diagnosis management palliative care and cancer registries.



To plan the mission a series of meetings were held with the WHO South East Asia technical unit about these needs and the decision was made to conduct a situation assessment of current cancer care services (prevention treatment and diagnostic services) in the country. During their five-day mission the team of seven experts met with multiple partners and stakeholders including the relevant departments of Ministry of Health teams from government and private hospitals NGOs UN agencies and the Maldives National Defense Force. The team also had a field visit to an atoll where they inspected and observed service delivery at Regional and Atoll Hospitals and island health care facilities.



“Maldives has made investments to equip primary health care with personnel medicines and equipment in each Island. These resources if optimally used can make a big difference in prevention and control of NCDs.” said Dr Cherian V. Varghese team lead of the mission and Regional Advisor for Noncommunicable Diseases WHO South East Asia “Establishing standard treatment protocols and referral thresholds will help to get the most out of the health services and to reduce referrals and out of pocket expenditure. WHO will support this area through piloting PHC-integrated NCD services in one Atoll as a demonstration site for comprehensive NCD services.”



Cancer was identified as a priority and a functioning cancer registry and a national cancer programme are priorities. Planning for radiation safety and nuclear medicine should also start now. WHO and IAEA stands committed to support Maldives in advancing these areas.

To conclude the weeklong events the team prepared and presented their findings and recommendations to WHO Representative Dr Nazneen Anwar Minister of Health His Excellency Ahmed Naseem and senior officials from the Ministry of Health. The next steps include working with Ministry of Health key institutions and contributors to develop a detailed plan for Nuclear medicine services (radiation safety standards and guidelines) and a National Cancer Control Plan.



“This is the first step WHO has taken to integrate NCDs to primary health care in Maldives. This first step itself will be immensely beneficial to the country” said Dr Nazneen Anwar WHO Representative “In addition WHO is pleased to extend support to the Government to control Cancer and introduce Nuclear medicine services; another first for the country.”



WHO is committed to utilize technical resources and high-level expertise to address and resolve public health burdens faced by Members States and to lead global efforts in expanding Universal Health Coverage.

Esta es la razón,"Para muchos es un sueño vivir en los Estados Unidos y más en condados como Miami-Dade y Palm Beach. Sin embargo las altas tasas de inflación que han afectado los últimos meses al país pueden en algunos casos obstruir el arraigo en tierras americanas para la compra de vivienda.

Según los informes de la Asociación de Agentes Inmobiliarios de Miami una parte del Sur de la Florida se vio afectada en la venta de residencias que disminuyó hasta el 50 % exactamente en tres condados registrando más de seis meses de una baja en ventas en este año comparado con el mes de julio del 2021.

Cabe señalar que los tres condados con más habitantes en la Florida son Palm Beach Miami-Dade y Broward que tienen resultados notorios ante el incremento de tasas de interés que no son proporcionales en la venta inmobiliaria.

De acuerdo con The Real Deal el condado de Broward se vio afectado en ventas de viviendas unifamiliares porque su precio aumentó hasta en un 21 % con una recesión de venta del 28 %.

Por su parte los condominios no tuvieron un alza en sus precios pero sus ventas no fueron visibles.

Por su parte Palm Beach tampoco se destaca en ventas pues sus condominios por su baja demanda alcanzaron una reducción de ventas en un 33 % que según como lo cuenta el sitio entre condominios y casas unifamiliares suman 2.222 ventas una cifra no favorable pero sí relevante para el sector.

En el caso de Miami-Dade un lugar turístico tuvo una caída en ventas hasta del 53 % siendo los condominios los que se vieron más afectados hasta en un 39 % en ventas y las residencias familiares en un 27 %.

Los precios de vivienda en todo el estado aumentaron. | Foto: Getty Images/iStockphoto

Por ejemplo una vivienda en el mes de junio tenía un precio en el lugar aproximadamente de $579.000 valor que es cuestionado en la actualidad por los agentes inmobiliarios.

Inflación anual en Estados Unidos comenzó a ceder y bajó a 85 % en julio

Después de marcar un nivel récord en el mes de junio del 91 % la Oficina de Estadísticas Laborales de Estados Unidos reveló que en julio la inflación anual en ese país comenzó a ceder y bajó a 85 % principalmente por la caída del precio de la gasolina.

El precio de la gasolina se redujo un 77 % durante el mes pasado y compensó alzas en los precios de los alimentos y vivienda lo que da como resultado que el índice de todos los artículos no cambie durante el mes. El índice de energía cayó 46 % durante el mes a medida que los precios de la gasolina y el gas natural disminuyeron pero el costo de la electricidad aumentó.

El alivio de la subida de los precios en julio respondió a la moderación del encarecimiento de la energía al 329 % desde el 416 % de junio mientras que en el caso de los alimentos la escalada de los precios se aceleró al 109 % desde el 104 % de junio el mayor aumento desde mayo de 1979.

Sin tener en cuenta el impacto de los alimentos y de la energía la tasa de inflación subyacente de Estados Unidos en julio fue del 59 % en línea con el dato del mes anterior. En comparación con el mes de junio la tasa mensual de inflación se mantuvo estable después de que el mes pasado registrase un incremento mensual del 13 %.

Aunque la inflación de Estados Unidos bajó a 85 % sigue siendo la más alta desde 1981 (41 años) y esto podría impulsar a la Reserva Federal (Fed) a subir fuertemente las tasas de interés otra vez tras un alza de 075 puntos porcentuales en julio para llevarlas entre 225 % y 250 %.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsZGlhcmlvYXIuY29tL211bmRvL2NyZWNlbi12ZW50YXMtbW9jaGlsYXMtYW50aWJhbGFzLWVwaWRlbWlhLXRpcm90ZW9zLWVzY29sYXJlcy1lZXV1XzFfOTI1NzAxMy5odG1s0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZWxkaWFyaW9hci5jb20vbXVuZG8vY3JlY2VuLXZlbnRhcy1tb2NoaWxhcy1hbnRpYmFsYXMtZXBpZGVtaWEtdGlyb3Rlb3MtZXNjb2xhcmVzLWVldXVfMV85MjU3MDEzLmFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Crecen las ventas de mochilas antibalas contra la epidemia de tiroteos escolares en EEUU,"El tiroteo escolar de Uvalde (Texas) en el que fueron asesinados 19 niños y dos maestras en mayo pasado sigue muy presente entre el profesorado el alumnado y los padres de Estados Unidos y se nota incluso en la lista de materiales para la vuelta al colegio que este próximo curso incluirá mochilas antibalas o transparentes.

El fundador y jefe ejecutivo de la tienda especializada en seguridad The Home Security Superstore David Artman cuenta a EFE que notó en los últimos 30 días un aumento tanto en las búsquedas como en las ventas de estas peculiares mochilas.

En el último mes casi 9.000 personas buscaron este tipo de morrales en la web de la tienda de Artman un 3.655 % más en comparación con el mes pasado un interés que también detectan otros vendedores y fabricantes de mochilas “blindadas”.

Con respecto a las ventas Artman dice que crecieron en general pero que es difícil contabilizar las de uso escolar porque “hoy en día muchos niños tienen el mismo tamaño que un adulto” y es imposible averiguar cuantas mochilas terminan en las espaldas de menores y de mayores.

La idea es que en caso de un tiroteo el niño pueda usar la mochila como un escudo pero Artman recuerda que a la hora de comprar este tipo de productos los padres tienen que tener en cuenta varios factores como el tipo de protección que quieren el tamaño y el peso.

Por ejemplo una mochila de su tienda con un diseño de emoticonos dirigida para los niños con protección del nivel 3A -es decir que puede bloquear casi todos los disparos de pistola incluidas las balas Magnum de 9 y 44 mm- pesa 12 kilos y mide 4191 cm de alto por 3048 cm de ancho.

Artman recomienda a los padres que corten las dimensiones que ellos buscan en un cartón y se pregunten si su hijo podría protegerse y que tengan en cuenta que a mayor tamaño consiguen más seguridad pero a cambio de más peso.

“Estamos haciendo todo lo posible para informar que no todas las mochilas van a detener todas las ráfagas y ciertamente no las ráfagas de AR 15 (rifle que usó Salvador Ramos en la masacre de la escuela de Texas)” añade.

Mochilas transparentes

Otros centros escolares optaron por otras soluciones diferentes en busca de mayor seguridad: así varios distritos escolares de Texas exigirán este curso entrante que los alumnos de sexto a duodécimo grado (entre 11 y 18 años) lleven mochilas transparentes o de malla.

“Reconocemos que las mochilas transparentes o de malla por sí solas no eliminarán los problemas de seguridad. Este es simplemente uno de varios pasos en el plan integral del distrito para garantizar mejor la seguridad de los estudiantes y el personal” dijo el distrito escolar de Dallas (Texas) tras anunciar la medida a mediados de julio.

El distrito ya compró las mochilas transparentes y está listo para distribuirlas antes del comienzo del año escolar.

Un “teatro de seguridad”

El presidente de la firma nacional de consultoría en seguridad escolar National School Safety and Security Services Ken Trump anota a Efe que tanto las mochilas antibalas como las transparentes aportan una especie de “paz mental” para los padres más que una “seguridad en sí” para los alumnos.

Con respecto a los macutos antibalas Trump que no está relacionado con el ex presidente señala que más bien son “resistentes a las balas no realmente a prueba de balas”.

En el caso de los que son transparentes el experto explica que entrar con una pistola es tan sencillo como enrollarla en una sudadera. “La realidad es que los que entran con armas a una escuela muy a menudo las llevan encima. Así que creo que eso es una especie de teatro de seguridad para crear la percepción de que se está haciendo algo y hacer que las personas se sientan emocionalmente seguras” subraya.

Además el experto destaca que tanto los padres como los encargados de seguridad de las escuelas tienen que preguntarse si las medidas en torno a estos raros eventos son efectivas o están creando más ansiedad e inseguridad para el alumnado.

Esta semana se viralizó en TikTok un video de una madre de Oklahoma enseñando a su hijo de 5 años cómo usar una mochila antibalas de Spider-Man y los pasos que tenía que seguir en el caso de un tiroteo en su clase.

Los tiroteos escolares en EE. UU. alcanzaron su máximo de dos décadas en 2021 con 93 tiroteos escolares de los que se tiene constancia según un informe del Centro Nacional de Estadísticas Educativas.

Newgarden from Nashville Tennessee drove to his series-leading fifth victory of the season in the No. 2 PPG Team Penske Chevrolet by .4708 of a second over rookie David Malukas whose spirited charge after the race restarted fell just short in the No. 18 HMD Honda but still resulted in a career-best finish. This also was Newgarden’s third straight victory at this 1.25-mile oval in the shadows of the Gateway Arch.

SEE: Race Results | Race Highlights

“I was so happy we could finish this race” Newgarden said. “Scott McLaughlin he wanted to win too. I love that about us. We have a good relationship. He drove me super fair there at the end.”

Two-time series champion Newgarden pulled to within three points of teammate and series leader Will Power in the race for the Astor Challenge Cup with just two races remaining. NTT P1 Award winner Power led a race-high 128 laps but finished sixth in the No. 12 Verizon Team Penske Chevrolet.

Scott McLaughlin finished third in the No. 3 Odyssey Battery Team Penske Chevrolet despite leading at the restart with 37 laps remaining after a red flag of two hours nine minutes due to rain and lightning.

Pato O’Ward finished fourth in the No. 5 Arrow McLaren SP Chevrolet while two-time Indianapolis 500 winner Takuma Sato placed fifth for his best result this season in the No. 51 Nurtec ODT Honda.

The championship race remains taut and tense. Seven drivers are still mathematically eligible to win the title with just 58 points – only four more than the maximum awarded at one race – separating leader Power from seventh-place O’Ward.

Up next is the Grand Prix of Portland on Sunday Sept. 4 at Portland International Raceway. The season ends with the Firestone Grand Prix of Monterey on Sunday Sept. 11 at WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca.

The official distance of this race was 260 laps but the rain delay almost made it feel like a 213-lap race in daylight followed by a 47-lap trophy dash under the lights.

When the race resumed at 9:05 p.m. local time track conditions had changed significantly because the rain cleaned the asphalt and there was better grip due to lower temperatures after sundown.

The starting field returned to the track under caution after the red flag was lifted and McLaughlin pulled away when the green flag flew on Lap 224. But Newgarden wasted no time tucking under McLaughlin’s gearbox on the back straightaway and dove under his teammate in Turn 3 on Lap 225 the first full lap after the restart to take the lead for good.

“We just had to have a good start” Newgarden said. “I knew Scott was going to be good at the end there and he had a great restart. I just tried to work the high lane. The high lane worked earlier for me. We just had enough to get by him. He was no slouch this weekend.”

McLaughlin stayed within approximately six-tenths of a second of his teammate for the next 34 laps but couldn’t find a way past. Meanwhile Malukas put the exclamation point on the most thrilling drive of his young career to advance from fifth at the restart to second at the finish.

Chicago-area native Malukas reached third place by passing O’Ward on Lap 245 and then set his sights on Newgarden and McLaughlin.

“We ended up getting around O’Ward and we ended up getting past a lapped car and they (pit box) said ‘You see them in front’ and I saw two Penskes and I was like ‘Oh my God they’re Penskes!’ They were tough.”

While he never challenged Newgarden Malukas passed McLaughlin for second on the final lap with a brave full-send outside move in Turn 1 aided by the additional traction of the cooler temperatures and clean racetrack.

Malukas’ previous-best finish before this stirring result was eighth last month in the second race of the doubleheader at the Iowa Speedway oval.

Teams attempted various pit strategies in the second half of the race to try and be out front when the expected rain arrived taking an unlikely win if the race didn’t restart. Malukas and Sato were on an alternate strategy that pushed Malukas to the lead from Laps 207-211 but he was forced to pit. The rain arrived just two laps later.

It appeared pit strategy and traffic may have foiled Newgarden just before the rain arrived.

McLaughlin pitted from second on Lap 207. Newgarden stopped one lap later from the lead but followed rookie Christian Lundgaard in the No. 30 Mi-Jack Honda into the pits with Newgarden’s pit in lap clocking in at 1.065 seconds slower than McLaughlin’s. McLaughlin kept the lead when Newgarden blended back to the racetrack after his stop holding the front until the red flag.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvYXVnLzIwL25vcnRoLWxpdHRsZS1yb2NrLWFyZW5hLXRvLXN0b3AtaG9zdGluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,North Little Rock arena to stop hosting graduations | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"NORTH LITTLE ROCK -- Operators of the Simmons Bank Arena in North Little Rock have notified school systems and higher education institutions that they will no longer make the large venue available for graduations.

""It's due to safety concerns"" Jana DeGeorge the arena's director of marketing said Thursday. ""In 23 years we have had three shootings outside of the building and they all have been at graduations.""

Shots were fired most recently May 17 after the North Little Rock High School graduation that night according to police and DeGeorge.

Officers responded to the shots around 9:15 p.m. according to reports by police at the time. Shortly before the shots police had been alerted to a possible disturbance with a weapon near the intersection of Riverfront Drive and Olive Street about a block south of the stadium. No injuries were reported and no weapons were located at the scene.

That was preceded just days before by a shooting after a May 12 graduation in Hot Springs DeGeorge noted.

In the Hot Springs case one person was killed and three others wounded outside the Hot Springs Convention Center in the aftermath of the Hot Springs World Class High School graduation ceremony.

""We want it to be safe and it's not safe so we are not going to do it"" DeGeorge said about forgoing graduations in the arena that can hold as many as 18000 people. ""I'm sure there are some [institutions] that are not happy and I totally understand that.""

The arena typically hosted 12 to 15 graduations a year DeGeorge said.

""All the schools have been called earlier this month to let them know that we weren't going to be hosting graduations anymore. That includes UAMS and Baptist Health. It's not just high schools"" she said.

The North Little Rock School District highlighted on its website this week the news about Simmons Bank Arena and that as a result the high school's Class of 2023 graduation ceremony will occur across the Arkansas River June 1 2023 at the Jack Stephens Center on the campus of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock.

The Jack Stephens Center holds about 5600 people.

""We wanted to share this information well in advance so that our seniors and families can prepare for this big day"" district spokesman Dustin Barnes posted on the website.

Leslie W. Taylor vice chancellor for communications and marketing for the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences said the university has used the North Little Rock arena for commencement exercises for several years most recently at a cost of $24389.

""It has been a wonderful location and provided us with enough seating for our nearly 1000 graduates taking part in commencement and their family members"" Taylor said. ""This year we had several thousand people in attendance and most of the arena was full even a great deal of the upper deck. We appreciate all of the staff of the arena and have enjoyed working with them on this event.

""We are moving commencement to Barton Coliseum for May of 2023"" Taylor said.

The Bryant Class of 2022 graduation ceremony was hosted at Simmons as was the ceremony in 2019 and years prior to that Bryant spokeswoman Devin Sherrill said Thursday.

The Bryant High School event that attracts as many as 10000 people used War Memorial Stadium in the spring of 2021.

After recently learning that Simmons would not be available Bryant district leaders are currently evaluating venues for the Class of 2023's graduation ceremony Sherrill said.

The Little Rock School District in the past two years has taken the graduation ceremonies outdoors -- using War Memorial Stadium in Little Rock -- and will do so again.

The district first used the stadium in 2021 and again in May 2022 at least in part as a way to limit the spread of covid-19. The outdoor stadium seats more than 50000 people and attendees could practice social distancing. War Memorial has been selected for the 2023 events district spokeswoman Pamela Smith said Thursday.

The Pulaski County Special School District has in recent years held its graduations at the Jack Stephens Center at UALR.

The North Little Rock-based Simmons arena opened as Alltel Arena in October of 1999 as a central Arkansas site for sports entertainment and meetings and conferences. The arena was later renamed Verizon Arena before becoming what is now the Simmons Bank Arena.

The arena is publicly owned by the Multi-Purpose Civic Center Facilities Board for Pulaski County. The arena was funded by a combination of local state and private monies.

LEESBURG Va. — The Centers for Disease Control reports that accidental overdose is one of the 10 leading causes of death.

August is Overdose Awareness Month. It’s why one Leesburg mother has decided to share her son's story about self-medicating and the dangers to buying illegal drugs.

“He hid it in a way that wasn't obvious at all. I think he found his own coping mechanisms and you know kind of deal with it in a way that was kind of invisible to me” Julie Hines said about her son.

Tyler Young was a bright young man in college. He was 19-years-old when his mother Julie found him unresponsive in their Leesburg home.

“Tyler was a victim of unfortunately the Fentanyl crisis that is happening in an enormous way in our country” she said.

Like millions of others Tyler suffered from high anxiety and his mother said he self-medicated.

“Unfortunately he purchased what he thought was a Percocet to calm the anxiety; but instead it was fentanyl” Hines said.

Sunday marks National Fentanyl Prevention and Awareness Day. Julie is hoping sharing Tyler’s story will prevent another parent from experiencing the heartbreak caused by the loss of her son.

“The best thing you can do is to talk to each other about it. Tyler wasn't addicted to any one thing. It wasn't like he had an addiction of blank. He would just do whatever he could whatever he could find to help calm his brain down” Hines said.

Julie and Verizon shared Tyler’s story and about the dangers of using drugs. Coping with the reality that he’s gone has been challenging. Since then his sister Alexis has written a book a memoir of her brothers life. Julie hopes their transparency helps someone else.

“My message would be you're not alone. You're not alone. Unfortunately this is a very big club that nobody wants to be part of. And don't be afraid to reach out to talk to people to share your stories” Hines said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY2l0eWxpZmUub3JnLzIwMjIvMDgvMjAvbXRhLWFubm91bmNlcy10aGUtaW5zdGFsbGF0aW9uLW9mLXdpLWZpLWFuZC1lbmhhbmNlZC1jZWxsdWxhci1zZXJ2aWNlLWF0LWphbWFpY2Etc3RhdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MTA Announces the Installation of Wi-Fi and Enhanced Cellular Service at Jamaica Station,"Installation Follows the Successful Roll-Out of Wi-Fi and Cellular Service in the Atlantic Terminal in 2021

The initial wireless carrier providing service for Jamaica Station through this new system will be Verizon with T-Mobile and AT&T coming online over the next several months.

The new Wi-Fi and cellular service will enable customers to better use the new seamless TrainTime app. Launched this week the new TrainTime app includes schedule and train-tracking information for both LIRR and Metro-North along with the ticket-buying functionality of MTA eTix.

“Any day that we can make our customers’ journeys better is a good day” said Metro-North President and Long Island Rail Road Interim President Catherine Rinaldi. “By adding Wi-Fi and improving cellular coverage at Jamaica Station we are providing a better customer experience and critically making the new TrainTime app even more accessible for mobile ticketing.”

Boingo was selected through a competitive Request for Proposals (RFP) process by the MTA as the neutral host provider for the LIRR Atlantic Branch to bring public-facing wireless connectivity across platforms and tunnels. The Atlantic Branch encompasses LIRR’s Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn Jamaica Station in Queens and the Atlantic Avenue Tunnel that connects the two locations. Boingo’s networks for LIRR are built and managed at no cost to the MTA and are designed to generate long-term revenue for the Authority with maximum cellular carrier participation. The installation of Wi-Fi at Jamaica Station comes after Boingo brought cellular coverage to the Long Island Rail Road Atlantic Branch Terminal and tunnels.

“For over 20 years Boingo has proudly served the people of New York by keeping them connected at transit hubs tunnels airports retail locations office buildings and high-rise developments—from the World Trade Center Oculus JFK LaGuardia and Newark to the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels Port Authority Bus Terminal and more” said Boingo CEO Mike Finley. “Launching cellular and Wi-Fi networks at Jamaica Station one of the busiest stations in North America is part of Boingo’s commitment to support digital transformation throughout the city and help world-class organizations like the MTA meet growing mobile connectivity demands.”

Boingo networks leverage a neutral host model that efficiently manages carrier cellular networks and can deploy a range of wireless technologies across 5G LTE Wi-Fi Wi-Fi 6/6E IoT and private networks under one managed platform. Verizon Wireless will begin providing service immediately through this system with T-Mobile planned for this fall and AT&T scheduled for early 2023.

How Ultragenyx delivered win for biotech venture philanthropy via GeneTx deal Rare disease company invested in a spinout of a non-profit that was making science decisions not just writing checks

Ultragenyx’s acquisition of the Foundation for Angelman Syndrome Therapeutics’ GeneTx is the capstone of a three-year partnership that has yielded the company a de-risked treatment for Angelman syndrome financial upside for the non-profit and the rare disease community another successful case study in venture philanthropy an area Ultragenyx CEO Emil Kakkis has helped pioneer.

We think we’ve got it figured out though. Grab your favorite hot drink (or glass of wine…it’s always a good option) and let us take you on a wild ride of how we see this playing out.

B&B Spoilers Wild Speculation

Picture this; Quinn is a woman currently on cloud nine. She has a hot new boyfriend who she can’t get enough of she’s thriving at work even though she’s still at the mercy of her very generous ex and she’s even come to terms with Eric Forrester’s (John McCook) reunion with Donna Logan (Jennifer Gareis). It’s messy but a good messy. Everything is the way it should be.

Quinn and Carter decide they want to throw themselves a little party (a wedding? Should it be a wedding?) so she runs off to Il Giardino to whip up some plans. Hey nothing like getting your ex who you tried to murder by pushing him off a cliff to lend a hand right?

B&B: Wrong Place Wrong Time

Unfortunately Deacon isn’t at the bar. No problem she knows where she lives so she decides to simply stop by. Shouldn’t be an issue right? Well not normally. But sadly this time is going to be much much different.

Without thinking Quinn will knock twice and enter. But what she’ll walk into isn’t Deacon tinkering about it’ll be an unmasked Sheila Carter (Kimberlin Brown). Talk about a shocker! This bombshell will blindside Quinn and she’ll hardly have time to react before Sheila jumps into action.

B&B Spoilers: The Death of Quinn

Sheila knows her freedom will ride and die keeping Quinn quiet. Deacon was one thing but Quinn is another. Even if Quinn promises to keep mum Sheila is well aware the second she walks out the door she’ll have the cops on the phone.

So Sheila does the only thing she can do to protect herself and silences Quinn once and for all. Poor Quinn won’t make it out of the room alive. Think this wild speculation could really happen? Let us know in the comments section below.

""If I leave I can't come back. So I've got to stay here for a while.""

Nixon Newell (fka Tegan Nox) hasn't wrestled since October. The former ""WWE NXT"" superstar was released from the company in November and has spent the months since inactive but contrary to what some have asked the Welsh wrestler hasn't retired. She's been caught up in red tape.

""I've been trying to get my green card for the last eight months"" Nox told the ""Sappenin'"" podcast. ""So if I leave then I can't come back ... It's just been a boring eight months living in Orlando.""

Nox sounded frustrated with the situation but she's been trying to make the most of it joking that she can ""go to Disney World everyday"" if she wants to.

""I can stay in America I just can't leave the States"" Nox said. ""Because I haven't got the visa or the green card I can't wrestle. So I keep getting messages 'Have you retired?' No I just can't. Legally. I can't.""

Nox isn't the only international wrestler dealing with visa issues. Former ""NXT"" Champion Finn Balor revealed earlier this year that he had to miss the Royal Rumble to get a new visa and ""WWE Raw"" superstar Doudrop had to miss this year's WrestleMania to get her own visa issues sorted out.

Nox's plan for waiting out the visa and green card process is simple: chilling.

""I've just been chilling in the house playing video games going to Sad Summer Fest"" she said. ""Chilling with my dogs. Chilling with my friends.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Manheim Township’s girls tennis team and Penn Manor senior Catherine Rabatin are hoping that adage holds true for them this season.

The Blue Streaks were 16-1 last year storming through the Lancaster-Lebanon League and District Three Class 3A before suffering their only loss in the first round of the PIAA tournament.

That capped a marvelous run under coach John Briner who stepped down after last season with a four-year record of 63-4. His assistant Carolyn Miller takes over this season.

Along with another year and a change of coaches comes a change of players. Most notably is Avery Palandjian who reached the L-L and district finals and advanced to the second round of states in a career marked by many successes but graduated.

Another year for Rabatin means trying to go a perfect 4-0 in her career in L-L and district 3A championships. She has reached the PIAA semifinals all three years.

Here are five things to watch in L-L girls tennis this season.

More of the same?

Manheim Township won its seventh straight league title and sixth straight District Three Class 3A crown in 2021. The Streaks will try to add to those marks without Palandjian.

Senior Kayla Kurtz will be looked at to lead the Streaks after reaching the 3A semifinals in the L-L where she lost to Palandjian and District Three before losing in the first round at states. She and Palandjian won L-L Flight 1 doubles.

Junior Jade Miller also returns after winning L-L Flight Two singles.

“I’m very hopeful for this season” said Miller in an email. “Although losing three varsity players I’m gaining several freshman players with lots of potential. I’ve also seen great improvement with some of my returning players.”

Rabatin beat Palandjian for both the L-L and district 3A titles. After dropping a 6-1 4-6 10-1 decision to Palandjian during the regular season she prevailed 6-4 6-2 in the league final and 6-0 2-6 6-3 for the district title.

“She has been training and playing tournaments in the offseason to get her prepared for her final season with Penn Manor and set herself up for success at the collegiate level” said Penn Manor coach Amanda Pryzbylkowski in an email.

Lancaster Catholic senior Anna Millen also hopes to follow suit after she repeated as the L-L and District Three Class 2A champion.

Others to watch

Right behind the Streaks in Section One was Hempfield (13-3) which lost close matches to Township in the regular season and L-L tournament. Township defeated the Knights 3-1 to win the L-L title.

Gone is No. 1 player Grace Lehman who reached the L-L semifinals but juniors Sophie Carson and Lydia Sullivan and sophomore Alex Gregory return. Carson teamed with Lehman to finish second in Flight One doubles while Sullivan won Flight Two doubles and Gregory Flight Three singles.

Lancaster Country Day put together a solid campaign last year going 11-5 7-1 in Section Three and advanced to the District Three 2A tournament. Maggie Auman a senior this year led the way.

Auman advanced to the L-L 2A semifinals as well as the district tournament losing to the eventual runner-up in the first round.

She teamed with Sophia Babar now a sophomore to finish second in the L-L 2A doubles and earn a No. 2 seeding in the district tournament.

Elco’s Ali Bender returns after winning the Lebanon County title and was an L-L Section Three all-star after reaching the league’s Class 2A semifinals. She’s part of a Raiders team that returns its entire lineup including Camryn Lehr who teamed with Bender to advance to both the L-L and district 2A semifinals.

That’s new

Making its first appearance in the league will be Linden Hall. The Lady Lions were 6-7 last year under Steve Berkley in his 15th year as head coach and return three of their top five singles players in seniors Ava O’Brien Mia Rossi and Melissa Figueroa.

Linden Hall will compete in the nine-team Section Three.

That’s special

Several teams will have some special events this season with newcomer Linden Hall among them. The Lady Lions will open their season Aug. 26 in the “Play for the Cure” tournament at Phoenixville. The tournament raises money for the Phoenixville Hospital Cancer Center.

Conestoga Valley under Dale Gregg coaching in his 37th year for the third year will collect old/practice tennis balls to recycle. Gregg’s program is one that is a no-cut team “so introducing players to the lifetime sport of tennis continues to be a priority.” Gregg noted in an email. He has 37 players on this year’s team.

Another no-cut program is McCaskey where coach Delaine Mast said she has her biggest turnout in years with 21 players.

It’s a date

Here are some important dates to note:

Monday — The first day of the regular season.

Aug. 29 — First league matches.

Sept. 29 Oct. 3 and 4 — L-L team tournament.

Oct. 6 8 and 10 — L-L flight tournament.

Oct. 14-15 — District Three singles.

Oct. 21-22 — District Three doubles.

When BART and Supervisor Hillary Ronen had those fences put up around the 24th and Mission plaza in late July in an attempt to curb illegal street vending the fences were supposed to stay up for 60 days while a vendor permitting process was put in place. On that announced timeline the fences were scheduled to stay up until late September.

Image: Joe Kukura SFist

They didn’t make it that long! SFist observed early Saturday afternoon that the fences have been suddenly torn down from the northeast corner of 24th and Mission Streets. (The fences were still up at the time of this Friday Chronicle report from the previous afternoon.)

We cannot confirm with certainty who removed the fences though an SFPD officer on the scene later Saturday afternoon told SFist it was ""protesters."" Further a collective called SF Mission DeFence promoted some sort of action there in the lead-up and has posted videos of their Saturday morning skirmishes with both SFPD and BART Police.

As seen above in a Friday Instagram post the timing coincides with an “All Day Saturday” action of “Grass Roots Community Outreach” to “Come out and Support the Plaza vendors and the Mission community.”

Screenshot via Instagram Post Now Deleted

A (now deleted) Saturday morning post from just after 8 a.m. declares “Show up right now at 24th and mission if you can to hold down the liberated space!” While that post has since been deleted SFist has a screenshot of it above.

Screenshot via Instagram Post Now Deleted

The above Instagram post from around 9 a.m. Saturday (also now deleted) showed a six-minute confrontation with BART Police. The fences had already been removed at the point this was filmed which may be why BART Police are there. DPW personnel could be seen in the background of the now-deleted video cleaning up the aftermath of well something.

“The community doesn't want this fence here” a protester can be heard telling an officer. “You’re just basically a white man that just gives a fuck more about his job to come record some Black and Brown people.”

That same protester also adds the gems that “These motherfuckers are just the epitomacy of white supremacy” and “These are rent-a-cops too so they’re not even real fucking pigs.”

Screenshot via Instagram Post Now Deleted

Another Instagram video from later Saturday (stop me if you've heard this before — now deleted) showed a confrontation with SFPD. It was basically just ten minutes of protesters yelling at SFPD.

But at the end of those ten minutes one of the protesters addressed a female SFPD officer by saying “She thinks she’s a man” and “a woman should never be walking around with a damn gun and a uniform."" When he added that she should be “barefoot and pregnant” the videographer cut the video perhaps realizing this was not their most winning message.

Image: Joe Kukura SFist

We have more indications that the removal of fences may have been related to a protest in a set of flyers posted around the station in both English and Spanish. “No Fence No Walls No Borders No Cops!” the flyers say. They also decry the vendor permitting legislation by saying “Supervisor Hillary Ronen is working with the city funded non-profit organization known as ‘Calle 24’ to kick vendors out of our shared community space (the 24th St. BART Plaza.)”

Image: Joe Kukura SFist

“We will not sit by quietly while the City treats (housed & unhoused) residents vendors & workers who use the plaza every day like a nuisance to be swept up into its squad cars & jails” the flyer notes in their call to action. “Vendors have a right to sell to survive to thrive in the spaces we all share.”

Image: Joe Kukura SFist

Notably the fencing was not removed at the southwest corner of Mission and 24th Street and the corner remains unaffected by Saturday’s activity.

Image: Joe Kukura SFist

Whereas on the northeast corner of 24th and Mission Streets the fences and barriers are all still there just no longer standing. They seem stacked in a fairly organized fashion which may or may not have been the work of DPW earlier in the day. There was no DPW SFPD or BART Police presence when SFist took these images shortly after noon Saturday.

Image: Joe Kukura SFist

But the larger issue is that the plaza is back open for now at least on the northeast corner. Whatever your feelings about this it has to be a relief for people using wheelchairs strollers and walkers as the fencing had very much limited their mobility.

Image: Joe Kukura SFist

Parenthetically Saturday is also seeing another of those recurring Lowrider Cruise events on Mission Street. These events now are fully sanctioned and permitted. The foot traffic they bring is also a great boon for the small businesses on Mission Street despite the outlaw origins of Lowrider culture decades ago.

And this presents an interesting contrast in the current culture of Mission Street itself in terms of what is currently being sanctioned and welcomed and what is not.

This is a developing story and SFist will provide updates if the situation changes.

A source close to the situation told Insider that DoorDash notified Walmart about its decision earlier this month citing that the partnership “was no longer mutually beneficial” and that it wants to “focus on its long-term customer relationships.”

DoorDash reportedly gave Walmart a 30-day notice which means the partnership will officially end in September. The two companies first teamed up in 2018 when Walmart started testing having groceries ordered through its site delivered by DoorDash. It went live in Atlanta Georgia to start but has since expanded to several other states.

“We have agreed to part ways with DoorDash” Walmart spokesperson Leigh Stidham said in an emailed statement to The Verge. “We’d like to thank DoorDash for their partnership and support of our customers the past several years.” DoorDash didn’t immediately respond to The Verge’s request for comment.

Walmart has been busy building out its own delivery service platform

It’s unclear whether DoorDash will offer deliveries from Walmart via its app though. DoorDash currently doesn’t let you order from Walmart presumably to avoid any conflicts with the service it offers through Walmart’s website. DoorDash rival Instacart on the other hand offers same-day deliveries from Walmart in some areas.

“We’d like to thank Walmart for their partnership and are looking forward to continuing to build and provide support for merchants in the years ahead with our leading Marketplace and Platform offerings” DoorDash spokesperson Ali Musa said in a statement to The Verge.

DoorDash and Walmart’s split isn’t all that surprising. Walmart has been busy building out its own delivery service platform Spark which hands off grocery deliveries to its own database of gig workers similar to the way Lyft and Uber operate. Walmart told Insider that Spark accounts for 75 percent of its deliveries and services 84 percent of households in the US. Last year Walmart also announced that it’s also working on a white label delivery service called GoLocal to handle last-mile logistics and deliveries for other businesses.

Bruce Bennett/Getty Images

Walmart is attracting more upper middle-class shoppers due to inflation.

CFO John Rainey touted an influx of customers with household incomes above $100000.

Inflation has prompted many Americans to adjust their spending habits.

Inflation is squeezing American consumers even the upper middle class. But according to the latest round of retail earnings calls the ongoing efforts of upper middle-class shoppers to pinch pennies are proving to be a boon to Walmart.

The big-box chain has strived to keep costs down in response to inflation. Walmart has also struggled with overstocked inventory much like its rival Target.

But the latest sales data indicates that inflation is driving some upper middle-class consumers to Walmart which recently saw its sales grow 8%. The company's chief financial officer John Rainey told CNBC that nearly 75% of Walmart's recent market-share gains came from ""customers with annual household incomes of $100000 or more"" who are turning to the big-box stores' grocery aisles. During the company's Tuesday earnings call Walmart announced that it had beat Wall Street estimates.

What exactly constitutes the upper middle class can vary throughout the United States depending on the local cost of living according to Pew Research. In a 2022 article noting that upper middle-class families are facing unique struggles during the pandemic the Wall Street Journal citing Fed data defined ""upper middle class"" as earning ""between $75301 and $127300 a year.""

'Walmart's advantage'

""The middle-class consumer is currently looking for value to save money"" Jharonne Martis director of consumer research at financial market data firm Refinitiv told Insider. ""They are cutting off their Netflix subscriptions and instead getting a membership at Sam's Club Costco or BJ's to save money at the pump. This is Walmart's advantage.""

In the latest earnings call Walmart CEO Doug McMillon announced that the company has ""continued to gain share in grocery.""

""Price leadership is especially important right now and one-stop shopping becomes more than just convenience when people are paying over $4 a gallon for fuel"" he said in a call with investors.

Martis also cited Walmart's foray into fuel — through the gas pumps available at Sam's Club locations — as a major advantage. In its latest earnings call Walmart announced that its revenue at Sam's Club had jumped 17.5% trouncing investors' expectations.

""At a time when economists are predicting that discretionary spending by consumers is likely to decline analysts polled by Refinitiv remain more bullish on discounters that sell gasoline versus those that don't"" Martis said.

The average Walmart shopper is a white suburban woman who earns around $80000 a year according to data from analytics firm Numerator though Walmart's focus on steep discounts has also attracted lower-income shoppers looking to save money.

One expert cited Walmart's recent investments in its digital capabilities in addition to its discounting as possible lures for more upper middle-class shoppers.

""Walmart's CEO mentioned this during the company's latest earnings call pointing to convenience and digital capabilities as reasons the company is successfully connecting with both middle and high-income shoppers"" Pieter de Villiers CEO at mobile messaging firm Clickatell said in a statement to Insider.







Inflation has prompted middle-class shoppers to rethink their consumption strategies. Over the summer the inflation rate hit 9.1% a 40-year-high. Since June prices have begun to cool down somewhat. In July prices only rose 8.5% year-over-year. Still ongoing inflation has made many Americans feel substantially poorer whenever they shop for groceries or hit the gas pump.

But these high prices aren't borne equally by everyone. Rising prices have traditionally harmed low-income consumers while wealthier shoppers have an easier time bearing the costs. That's no different for the current trend of inflation which came in the wake of a pandemic that saw thousands of citizens fall below the poverty line. And even financially-secure shoppers may be looking to scale back spending.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDVhdGxhbnRhLmNvbS9uZXdzL2d1bi1hY2NpZGVudGFsbHktZmlyZXMtaW4tbG92ZWpveS13YWxtYXJ0LWluanVyaW5nLTQtcGVvcGxlLXBvbGljZS1zYXnSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3g1YXRsYW50YS5jb20vbmV3cy9ndW4tYWNjaWRlbnRhbGx5LWZpcmVzLWluLWxvdmVqb3ktd2FsbWFydC1pbmp1cmluZy00LXBlb3BsZS1wb2xpY2Utc2F5LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gun accidentally fires inside Lovejoy Walmart injuring 4 people police say,"Police say a man may face charges in Clayton County after his gun accidentally fired inside a Walmart injuring himself and three other people.

According to the report nearly 40% of high-income and middle-income shoppers purchase private-label items.

Numerator also found that Walmart owns four of the top five private brands. Ranked by household penetration Numerator reports the top five private brands to include Walmart’s Great Value purchased by 72.7% of the U.S. population; Equate which has a 52% market share; Marketside at 44.2%; and Fresh Guaranteed at 40% market penetration. Dollar Tree ranked fifth for its private brand market share at 32.5%.

While Walmart holds a significant lead over its competitors with private brand market share Numerator found Aldi Target and Amazon are gaining ground with their private brand reach. In 2020 Amazon had grown its private brand business to include 45 different labels offering 243000 items across a wide range of categories such as AmazonBasics apparel which the company launched in 2005.

In mid-July Amazon announced plans to reduce the number of private brands it sells because of weak sales. Analysts said Amazon has been evaluating its private brand sales over the past year under the leadership of new CEO Dave Clark. Amazon is expected to reduce the scale of its private brands by as much as 50% in its U.S. business.

“We continue to invest in this area just as our many retail competitors have done for decades and continue to do today” Amazon stated.

Numerator reports AmazonBasics saw its market share grow 1.7% in the second quarter of this year. While Amazon captures a higher private label share among its consumer electronics and home goods products the retailer posts a private label share of only 3% among grocery household and health and beauty products.

Target’s private-label market share for grocery household health and beauty is 15.1% Whole Foods Market is 14.7% and Publix is 13.6%. That compares to more than 60% for Walmart’s market share in those categories. Numerator reports Target’s Favorite Day brand market share increased 2.2% in the second quarter second only to Aldi’s 2.3% market share growth in the same period Numerator reports.

MEMBER’S MARK GAINS

Sam’s Club reduced the number of its private brands in recent years and worked to grow the market share of its Member’s Mark brand. Numerator said Member Mark’s market share rose 1.3% in the second quarter. Member’s Mark represents 30% of total sales at Sam’s Club equal to $22.08 billion. Sam’s Club has also worked to make its Member’s Mark brand more attractive to consumers according to Sam’s Club CEO Kath McLay. During the retailer’s shareholder events in June she told the media that Member’s Mark aspires to be brand customers “must have” because they trust the quality and value.

Since 2017 Sam’s has grown the value of its Member’s Mark by more than 100% and it remains the top preferred brand on SamsClub.com the company said. Company leadership said the successful growth of Member’s Mark is more than added sales. It’s also about creating a solid asset and loyalty base for the retailer’s overall business.

Sam’s said it is evaluating the Member’s Mark assortment and adhering to and developing high standards for every new item. McLay said that the item is either improved or abandoned if members are not impressed.

Costco is at the top of the list among retailers that have somewhat perfected private brands. Its iconic brand Kirkland represents 33.5% of Costco’s sales and the brand is worth more than $75 billion.

Scott Benedict a former buyer for Sam’s Club and now executive at Rogers marketing agency WhyteSpyder said a strong private brand could be a real differentiator. Benedict applauds the work Sam’s Club has done with its Member’s Mark brand which excelled early in consumable items but has recently made a name for itself in higher-margin general merchandise and apparel. He said the Kirkland Signature brand is an example of that for Costco. Amazon has also made headway with the AmazonBasics brand now the best seller on Amazon.com.

CONSUMER SENTIMENT

While many retailers have invested in private brands in recent years Aldi sits at the top for the share of private brand sales relative to all sales at 77.5%. Numerator said 82.6% of items sold during the second quarter at Aldi were private brands. According to Numerator Aldi’s parent company Trader Joe’s is also a private brand destination with 59.4% of sales being from the 56.9% of house brands it offers.

Wegmans was third for its share of market share spend in the second quarter at 49.4%. Roughly half of the units sold at Wegmans in the period were private brands. Costco and Sam’s Club ranked fourth and fifth with a 33.5% and 30% share of spend respectively in the second quarter.

Texas-based grocery giant H-E-B was sixth with private brands being 26.9% share of spend in the quarter. About one in every three items sold at H-E-B in the second quarter was a private brand. Walmart has similar results as the seventh largest share of private brands spend at 23.3%. Numerator said that every 23 out of 100 items Walmart sold in the second quarter was a private brand.

There has been an uptick in recent months among consumers who say the price is more important than the brand name particularly among low-income consumers. Overall sentiment regarding private labels’ value for money has stayed relatively consistent over the past couple of years with over half of consumers (55%) rating its value for money excellent or above average Numerator noted in the report.

The report found that 38% of consumers said they purchase private brands to save money 32% of those were from low-income households and 40% were from middle-income families. Roughly 30% of low-income households and 27% of middle-income households said private brand quality has improved over time.

Some Guests found themselves in an unlucky position when the rain started – on board the Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover at Magic Kingdom.

This trend continued at Disneyland Paris with the Resort facing harsh temperatures and even harsher storms leaving both Parks completely underwater. However None of the Disney Parks seem to have as brutal weather as the Walt Disney World Resort faces on a regular basis with high temperatures and brutal humidity beating down on Guests daily.

Recently the Walt Disney World Resort faced some intense storms accompanied by lightning strikes. Several Guests were able to capture photos of the strikes and the results are unbelievable.

Hospitality Professional and Director of Revenue Management Scott Campbell (@scottcampbell) shared a few pictures of the storms with one photo in particular actually showing lightning that nearly struck them as they rode the Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover. You can see the full suite of photos linked below:

This was some insane storm over the Magic Kingdom today. Had one bolt strike right next to me as you can see if you zoom in on the first pic.

Have you ever experienced any intense storms while visiting Disney World?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vY3VsdHVyZS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjIwODE4LXRoZS1zdXJwcmlzaW5nbHktc2NhbmRhbG91cy1vcmlnaW5zLW9mLWRpc25leWxhbmTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The scandalous roots of the amusement park,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW1lcGFya2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2ZsdW1lLzIwMjIwOC85MTA0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Hot Is Too Hot for a Disney Trip?,"How Hot Is Too Hot for a Disney Trip?

Let's talk about weather - especially those super steamy hot summer days that so many of us have experienced recently.

How hot is too hot for you to consider visiting a theme park? I mentioned Disney in the headline since Walt Disney World and Disneyland remain America's top theme park resort destinations. But let's consider any theme park for the purpose of today's vote which you will see below.

Many years ago summer was the undisputed high season at the Disney theme parks. Sure the very biggest crowds hit during the holiday week between Christmas and New Year's Day but the summer brought consistently large crowds to all the Disney World parks and Disneyland.

These days spring break at Walt Disney World and the fall at Disneyland often deliver crowds as big and sometimes bigger than you find during the summer vacation months. Now part of that is due to the overall growth in attendance at Disney and the fact that the crowds had to spill over somewhere. But many of us who visit the parks frequently especially at Disneyland have suspected that summer crowds are not quite as big as they once were.

Over the past couple of years Disney's new reservation system surely has played a part in that shift. But we were seeing weakening summer attendance at Disneyland before the pandemic. Could hotter summer weather be playing into a seasonal shift among theme park visitation?

Regional parks always have prospered and suffered with the weather. With fewer people planning long-distance trips to them regional parks rely on good weather to help inspire locals to come out and enjoy the day. Traditionally it's been rain that has done the most to deter visits but heat definitely can keep visitors at home or looking for air-conditioned alternatives instead.

And in California let's not forget that smoke from the wildfires that often accompany dry summer heatwaves also has a profound affect on people's willingness to spend the day outside such as at Disneyland.

I am curious to hear how you factor heat into your theme park plans. How hot is ""too hot"" varies by person of course. Spending the day out in temperatures in even the high 70s to low 80s (F) can lead to heat exhaustion for some visitors. But with the right precautions and care many visitors and employees can get through a day with temperatures in the 90s and even beyond.

I know that some people will want to talk about humidity and its effect on how hot it feels on a given day. But at a certain point the lack of humidity no longer matters in avoiding discomfort and danger.

While 90F and humid feels a lot worse than 90F with lower humidity moisture in the air can serve to limit how hot a day can get. You rarely see days up in the 100s in Florida where the mix of high heat and humidity often triggers thunderstorms that serve as a brake on runaway heat. In the west however lower humidity can allow the temperature to soar into the 100s. That's nasty and dangerous for anyone even if it is a so-called ""dry heat.""

For our vote below please select the option that best describes your feeling about dealing with heat and theme parks. (Remember that votes on Theme Park Insider are completely anonymous.)

In the comments we would love to hear some details about how this summer's weather may or may not have affected your theme park plans if you care to share. As always thank you for reading Theme Park Insider.

Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Chapek keeps making decisions that distance himself from his predecessor Bob Iger. As CNBC reported earlier this year Iger hasn't agreed with several decisions Chapek has made as Disney's CEO including his reorganization of the company and his handling of Florida's controversial ""Don't Say Gay"" legislation. The latest break is the 38% price increase for Disney+ announced last week as part of a slew of announcements surrounding Disney's new advertising-supported service which will launch on Dec. 8. Disney+ without ads will increase from $7.99 per month to $10.99 per month. Disney+ with ads will begin at $7.99 per month. Chapek's pricing strategy differs from the philosophy Iger espoused according to people familiar with both men's thinking. Iger wanted Disney+ to be the lowest-priced major streaming offering said the people who asked not to be named because the discussions were private. That way customers would view Disney+ as a stronger value proposition to its competitors even if it felt other services' content might be more robust. This is also why Iger argued to keep Disney+ separate from Hulu and ESPN+ a strategy Chapek has thus far maintained. At $7.99 per month with ads Disney+ will now be more expensive than several other ad-supported products including NBCUniveral's Peacock ($4.99) and Paramount Global 's Paramount+ ($4.99) though it will remain cheaper than Warner Bros. Discovery 's HBO Max ($9.99). At $10.99 the ad-free Disney+ will not only be more expensive than Peacock and Paramount+ but it will also be pricier than Amazon Prime Video ($8.99) which also doesn't include commercials. Disney+ without ads will still significantly underprice Netflix ($15.49) and HBO Max ($14.99). Disney's bundled offering of Disney+ Hulu with ads and ESPN+ with ads will be $14.99 per month an increase of $1 from its previous cost. ""We launched at an extraordinarily compelling price across all the platforms that we have for streaming"" Chapek said last week. ""I think it was easy to say that we're probably the best value in streaming. Since that initial launch we've continued to invest handsomely in our content. We believe because the increase in the investment over the past two-and-a-half years relative to a very good price point that we have plenty of room on price value.""

Iger vs. Chapek

Iger's strategy was to slowly raise prices over time targeting a $1 per month increase each year for the near future the people said. That's what happened in March 2021 when Chapek was CEO and Iger was still chair. Disney+ jumped from $6.99 to $7.99. Iger stepped down as Disney's chair in December. Slow price increases would allow Disney to suck up as many consumers at each price level — $6.99 $7.99 $8.99 etc. — as possible. Iger declined to comment about Disney+'s new pricing. A Disney spokesperson declined to comment on the differences between Chapek's and Iger's strategies. Chapek's decision to bump Disney+ by $3 per month from $7.99 to $10.99 suggests he's moving Disney's strategy from maximizing subscriber growth to emphasizing profitability. The pricing decision goes hand-in-hand with Chapek's decision not to pay for the streaming rights of Indian Premier League the country's top cricket league. Chapek also decided to raise ESPN+'s price by $3 per month from $6.99 to $9.99. Without the Indian Premier League starting in 2023 Chapek lowered Disney's guidance first made in 2020 that Disney+ would have 230 million to 260 million subscribers by the end of 2024. Disney's new subscriber forecast by the end of 2024 is 215 million to 245 million. During the last two years of Iger's tenure in 2020 and 2021 lowering streaming guidance likely would have led to Disney shares plummeting. Instead last week Disney shares barely budged when CFO Christine McCarthy announced the news on a conference call and rose 6% the day after Disney's earnings which included a 15 million Disney+ subscriber gain in the quarter. The change has to do with investors' collective souring on Netflix this year which has affected the entire streaming video industry.

Netflix effect

Chapek is betting investors are OK with a smaller total addressable market of streaming subscribers if the paying customers lead to a profitable business. Disney's streaming services lost $1.1 billion in its most recent quarter. The large price hikes should get the streaming business to profitability by the end of 2024 even with a lower total subscriber count Chapek said last quarter. Still it's notable Disney had previously planned on getting to streaming profitability by 2024 even before the price increases. Netflix's growth has for the moment topped out at around 220 million global subscribers. Shares are down more than 60% this year after Netflix has lost subscribers through the first half of the year and projects to add just 1 million paying customers in the third quarter.

The Netflix valuation decline gives cover to executives such as Chapek and Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav to reprioritize profit over subscriber growth. Disney is also taking strides to show the market that it should be focusing on average revenue per user now rather than just Disney+ subscriber adds. Disney made a point during its third-quarter earnings presentation last week to separate its ""core Disney+"" subscribers from its Disney+ Hotstar subscribers based in India to showcase the much higher average revenue per user for Disney+. The average revenue per Disney+ subscriber was $6.29 per month at the end of Disney's fiscal third quarter. The ARPU for a Hotstar subscriber was $1.20 per month. Disney plans to have 135 million to 165 million core Disney+ subscribers by the end of 2024 and ""up to"" 80 million Hotstar customers.

Near-term profits

By pricing Disney+ with commercials at $7.99 the current price of Disney+ Chapek is favoring higher ARPU over accumulating data on how many customers may be willing to pay for Disney+ at a lower price that won't subscribe at $7.99. Chapek ostensibly already knows the Disney+ market at $7.99 in the U.S. and Canada because that's what Disney+ is priced at currently. Another of Iger's motivations to underprice competition with incremental raises was that Disney could get a good sense of demand trends as they bumped Disney+ up by $1 per month per year according to a person familiar with the matter. Chapek could have learned how many subscribers would be interested in Disney+ at say $4.99 per month if he made that the starting price with advertisements. His decision to start at $7.99 again suggests he's more interested in near-term profitability rather than quick subscriber gains that could morph into higher paying customers over time. It also suggests he's confident the price increase won't cause a drop in Disney+ demand. ""We do not believe that there's going to be any meaningful long-term impact on our churn as a result"" of the price hikes Chapek said.

English view video Spoilers of the Week | June 10th

For fans of Warner Media’s animation slate a good chunk of series including 200 Sesame Street episodes and cult classic shows like Infinity Train and OK KO were yanked from the streaming service earlier in the week. In some cases such as Summer Camp Island the series were preparing to debut new seasons that now just won’t air. (Per the AV Club Cartoon Network will air the final season of Summer Camp Island along with the new season of Victor & Valentino sometime in the near future.) While some of these shows can be seen on other services the creators and employees of those shows straight up weren’t aware of what was going on until the removals were on the cusp of happening.

No matter how one wishes to slice it and even before you learn that it’s allegedly being done in the name of saving money on residuals WBD’s decision just comes across as needlessly cruel. Several of these shows were specifically made for HBO Max and as such lack physical releases or legal ways to watch them. Going so far as to wipe any trace of these shows from other social media channels and prevent related media from being experienced is just twisting the knife.

It’s especially damning because in several respects animation is Warner Bros. Whether one grew up on Looney Toons the Powerpuff Girls or Steven Universe WB’s slate of cartoons and films are a big part of western animation. Cartoon Network’s had arguably the best lineup of animated shows for decades and they’ve always been pretty good about calling back to their history while looking forward. Cartoon Network is turning 30 years old in a couple of months but it hardly feels like a time to celebrate when it has this current stink around it to say nothing of if the new shows and animated films that were previously announced for Warner Media actually still exist under this new regime. And it’s not a good sign if even the DC animated slate is getting caught in the crossfire when those things have generally been allowed to do their own thing.

Warner Bros. Discovery’s bloodbath will more than likely continue through the rest of the year depressing as it sounds. It sucks that as the animation industry was making strides to being recognized as a vital part of the entertainment machine especially as it wasn’t kneecapped by the pandemic like live-action productions were that CEO David Zaslav has such contempt for the company he bought. We’ve known for years that mergers are bad but more than previous instances what’s happening to Warner Bros. has really emphasized how bad it is for corporations to have control of everything.

The movie has been touted as a larger plan to cut corners since the merger of Warner Bros. and Discovery. Many of its senior members aren’t completely satisfied with the decisions with the cancellation of batgirl raising the most eyebrows.

The OWN gets hit by the firing spree.

The Oprah Winfrey Network is one of the most popular talks shows out there. Hosted by Oprah Winfrey the talk show’s main audience is the African American population. A report by variety suggests OWN will be losing some very experienced executives due to the WB-Discovery layoffs.

Discovery for Removing Animated Series,"After cruelly pulling the plug on Batgirl and the animated feature Scoob!: Holiday Haunt Warner Bros. Discovery is removing several beloved animated series from HBO Max. OK K.O! Let’s Be Heroes Close Enough Infinity Train Aquaman: King of Atlantis Uncle Grandpa The Fungies and Summer Camp Island are among the titles that have been discarded without warning. The mass removals are the result of the Warner Bros. merger with Discovery and new CEO David Zaslav who is consolidating both studios resulting in cancelled series massive layoffs and a confusing future for HBO Max content. And while it’s disappointing for fans it’s devastating for the series creators and animators who have spent their blood sweat and tears on these projects over the years.

Infinity Train creator Owen Dennis responded to the situation via his blog “Owen Dennis’s Infinite Train of Thought”  where he discussed how the abrupt removal affects the artists and creators of these series. He notes that none of the creators or showrunners were warned that their series were getting kicked off the platform. He wrote “The announcement on Wednesday of Infinity Train OKKO Summer Camp Island The Fungies and many other shows being taken off of HBOMax was a shock to all of us. Not just to fans but to the creators and artists that made the shows as well. I had no idea it was coming neither did any other show creator I’ve talked with nor any of their representatives.”

He adds that the removal was supposed to happen next week giving Cartoon Network time to inform the series creators. That obviously didn’t happen which is a massive betrayal of trust from the network’s overlords. “Cartoon Network warned them not to do this as it would hurt relationships with creators and talent but they clearly do not care what any of this looks like publicly much less about how we feel about it.”

Dennis then gets at the reason for the series removals and it comes down to money. WBD is looking to save money via residuals payments which artists and writers are entitled to for the life of the series. And while there is payment up front for this kind of work many artists rely on residuals to survive. Dennis explains “Our pay is not complete without the ongoing residuals. Those residuals aren’t paid directly to the artists they actually go to our union to pay for our healthcare. So not paying artists residuals on their work means they are indirectly defunding our healthcare.”

Residual payments add up to a scant amount of money saved for the studio but its crucial financial support for the artists. Cutting series to save on residuals is a cruel and unnecessary step that screws over writers and artists who are already facing a pay gap with live-action writers. Dennis summed up his view point writing “I think the way that Discovery went about this is incredibly unprofessional rude and just straight up slimy. I think most everyone who makes anything feels this way. Across the industry talent is mad agents are mad lawyers and managers are mad even execs at these companies are mad. I can’t think of a single person who works in animation and entertainment that when you bring this all up doesn’t say “What the fuck are they doing? How do they plan to have anyone ever want to work with them again?””

Many creators agreed with Dennis sharing their heartbreak and dismay on social media:

I've barely worked anywhere else in my 13 years in animation. I learned everything I know from working on Regular Show and Close Enough. CN feels like home. I'm just so unbelievably bummed out. — Calvin Wong (@calwong) August 18 2022

We worked for 5 years to make 100 episodes of animation. We worked late into the night we let ourselves go we were a family of hard working artists who wanted to make something beautiful and HBO MAX just pulled them all like we were nothing. Animation is not nothing! — Julia Pott (@juliapott) August 18 2022

The Yakama Nation is on a quest to rescue it,"Trina Sherwood gazes out at the Hanford nuclear site as she speeds across the Columbia river in a small motorboat. More than 500 sq miles large and ringed by rocky mountains the decommissioned nuclear production site is considered one of the most contaminated places in North America.

It also sits on the ancestral lands of the Yakama Nation and other Indigenous peoples in Washington state. Here precious wildlife vision quest sites and burial grounds lie side-by-side with signs reading “warning hazardous area” and towering nuclear reactors some of which date back to the second world war.

There’s Gable Mountain where young men would fast and pray explained Sherwood a cultural specialist for the Yakama Nation’s Environmental Restoration/Waste Management (ER/WM) program. There’s Locke Island where an Indigenous village once stood and the towering White Bluffs where Native people collected white paint for ceremonies. There are also outcroppings of tules which were used to make mats for ceremonies and tipis as well as yarrow root which was known to treat burns.

The Hanford nuclear site was established in 1943 as part of the Manhattan Project and over the next four decades produced nearly two-thirds of the plutonium for the US’s nuclear weapons supply including the bomb dropped on Nagasaki.

During its lifespan hundreds of billions of gallons of liquid waste were dumped in underground storage tanks or simply straight into the ground. After the site’s nine nuclear reactors were shut down by 1987 about 56m gallons of radioactive waste were left behind in 177 large underground tanks – two of which are currently leaking – alongside a deeply scarred landscape.

In the decades since the Yakama Nation has been one of four local Indigenous communities dedicated to the cleanup of this historic landscape. For the Yakama Nation that has meant tireless environmental and cultural oversight advocacy and outreach with the hope that one day the site will be restored to its natural state opening the doors to a long-awaited unencumbered homecoming.

Today their outreach work has reached a fever pitch. There are few Yakama Nation elders still alive who remember the area before its transformation and there are likely decades to go before cleanup is complete. So members are racing to pass on the site’s history to the next generation in the hopes they can one day take over.

They didn’t have time to pack up anything. They just had to leave and they were never told why and how long they were going to be gone LaRena Sohappy

“Our elders are leaving that have that historical knowledge; people that actually lived there during that time and can tell you stories about the area” said Laurene Contreras administrator for ER/WM the program responsible for the Yakama Nation’s Hanford work. “That’s why it’s so important for us to make sure that we’re carrying that message forward.”

‘Religious and moral duty’

Yakama Nation history on the Hanford site dates back to pre-colonization when people would spend the winter here fishing for sturgeon salmon and lamprey in the Columbia River as well as gathering and trading with other families. In 1855 the Nation ceded over 11m acres of land to the US which included the Hanford area and signed a treaty that relegated them to a reservation while allowing the right to continue fishing hunting and gathering roots and berries at “all usual and accustomed places”.

But in the 1940’s the situation shifted dramatically when the area was cleared out to make room for the construction of nuclear reactors.

LaRena Sohappy 83 vice-chairwoman for Yakama Nation General Council whose father was a well-known medicine man grew up in Wapato about 40 miles from Hanford. She said she remembers the strawberry fields that lined the Hanford site her family gathering Skolkol a root and daily food and traveling to the area for ceremonies.

Her cousin’s family who lived close to Hanford were woken in the middle of the night and forced to leave to make way for the nuclear site she recalled

“They didn’t have time to pack up anything” said Sohappy. “They just had to leave and they were never told why and how long they were going to be gone.”

The effort to give Indigenous people a voice in Hanford’s fate was forged in part by Russell Jim a member of Yakama Nation’s council whose work has been credited with helping to keep Hanford from becoming a permanent “deep geologic repository” a place where high-level nuclear waste from this site and others across the country would be stored.

“From time immemorial we have known a special relationship with Mother Earth” Jim who died in 2018 said in a statement to the US Senate in 1980. “We have a religious and moral duty to help protect Mother Earth from acts which may be a detriment to generations of all mankind.”

Today the ER/WM program which was founded in the early 1980’s with Jim at the helm includes such staff as a biologist ecologist and archeologist. It’s funded by the US Department of Energy (DoE) which operates the Hanford site and leads the cleanup process under an agreement with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Washington state department of ecology.

The Yakama Nation program’s focus is on accelerating a thorough cleanup of the site protecting culturally significant resources and assessing the threats to wildlife and water.

The area around Hanford is considered the last free-flowing section of the Columbia River. There’s a major spawning site for Chinook salmon and all along this section of the waterway sturgeon live all year round explained Phil Rigdon Yakama Nation acting Tribal Administrative Director.

“Our people we’re fish people we’re salmon people in the Columbia River … So for us that was a priority” he said.

Chemicals including mercury which can damage the brain kidneys and heart and PCBs which can cause cancer have been found in the river and could be ingested when eating fish according to a 2017 advisory. For the Hanford Reach a 150-mile section of the river that runs through Hanford it suggests limiting consuming some fish to four or fewer times a month.

In the past decade it was also discovered that hundreds of gallons of highly radioactive waste have been leaking from two Hanford tanks threatening the Columbia River.

McClure Tosch a Natural Resource Injury Assessment lead for ER/WM said recently Yakama Nation has played a key role in developing a plan for the EPA to monitor the basin including fish tissue.

ER/WM has also been advocating for the federal government to test the wells at Hanford near the Columbia River for PFAS long-lasting chemicals that can be found in an array of commercial and industrial products. If found Tosch said that could be a huge concern for the local drinking water. The energy department said in a statement: “Information-gathering about the occurrence and use of PFAS at DoE sites is ongoing”.

There has also been a focus by the Yakama Nation to preserve culturally significant plants. Most recently Sherwood has been overseeing the protection of a bright yellow plant known as Umtanum desert buckwheat. It has long been known as a medicinal plant for the local Indigenous people and today Hanford is the only place in the world where it is documented as growing.

A ‘push and pull’ effect

Despite the sometimes glacial nature of the federal government’s work the Yakama Nation have scored some important wins.

Recently the ER/WM succeeded in amending a cleanup proposal for an area next to the Columbia River containing nuclear reactors ensuring it will include a review of the impact on local aquatic insects. And in the coming months Tosch says the tribe will work with the federal government to assess the effectiveness of a polyphosphate injection to sequester uranium found in Hanford’s groundwater; an approach the tribe has questioned.

ER/WM staff have also pushed back against a federal government change in how high-level radioactive waste is classified which could downgrade some of Hanford’s waste ultimately preventing it from being removed from the site as expected. The energy department said they don’t plan to move forward with this new interpretation without first meeting with local Indigenous Nations.

For their part both DoE and EPA said their representatives meet with Yakama Nation regularly about Hanford and have benefitted from their’s and other local Indigenous Nations’ expertise and input.

But Brian Stickney DoE’s deputy manager for the Hanford Site said in a statement that while Yakama Nation wants to see the lands returned to a pre-nuclear state DoE is focused on regulatory requirements and protecting treaty rights.

The Washington state department of ecology which helps to oversee the Hanford cleanup and whose officials meet with the Yakama Nation at least once a month described their relationship with the tribal Nation as a bit “push and pull”.

“We are the regulators and sometimes Yakama Nation would like us to push a little harder than they perceive us doing” said Laura Watson its director. “And so there’s a little bit of that push and pull. And that’s fine that’s actually important as a regulator to have folks pushing.”

We have a religious and moral duty to help protect Mother Earth from acts which may be a detriment to generations of all mankind Russell Jim

‘For our children not yet born’

A fully rehabilitated Hanford site likely won’t happen within the lifetime of Yakama Nation’s elders or even the generation that follows. So they’re working diligently to bring in younger tribal members to the effort.

In recent years they’ve held coloring contests a mass postcard mailing campaign and visited local schools explained Samantha Redheart who coordinates Stem programs for ER/WM. They’ve also offered college scholarships for students studying such subjects as engineering and science in the hopes that the recipients may one day bring that knowledge back to the community.

“We always share that Hanford is a multi-generational cleanup site” she said. “Yakama Nation leaders and management are always looking into not just the cleanup today but for our future generations and of our children that are not yet born.”

22 high school students were allowed to visit Hanford in 2016 - a rare opportunity explains Redheart as those under 16 are typically not allowed on most of the site. She said they took them to a series of culturally important sites pointing out traditional cultural artifacts and salmon spawning grounds. But the experience was thoroughly regimented involving energy department staff hazmat guides and strict timelines.

If Sohappy had her way sharing her knowledge of Hanford before it was a nuclear site with the next generation would involve something of a trip back in time. She would take them on wagons and horses to each of the important sites making sure to point out where the strawberry fields and old town once stood.

It’s difficult to know whether that will ever be a reality. She herself hasn’t been to Hanford in over a decade.

“It angers me that I can’t go where my dad used to wander around” she says. “There’s nothing there that’s pleasurable. Not anymore anyway. It’s all torn up.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vb2lsY2l0eS5uZXdzL2dlbmVyYWwvMjAyMi8wOC8yMS9maXJlZmlnaHRlcnMtY2FzcGVyLXdhc3RlLW1hbmFnZW1lbnQtY3Jld3MtdGFja2xlLWxhbmRmaWxsLWZpcmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Firefighters Casper waste management crews tackle landfill fire,"CASPER Wyo. — At 2 a.m. Saturday Casper firefighters responded to a reported wildland fire on Amoco Road.

The garbage collection was disrupted after the locals from Sisdol and Banchare Danda obstructed the transportation of garbage time and again.

""If locals do not obstruct garbage transportation and the road to reach the landfill site remains normal it would take 10 days to complete the garbage management"" said Sunil Lamsal a member of Mayor Shaha's Secretariat.

Lamsal stated that 8000 tippers of garbage from 18 local levels of the Kathmandu Valley need to be managed for now. Once the work of management resumes at a normal pace it would take at least 10 days to dispose of the garbage accumulated so far in Kathmandu Valley. Chief district Officers from Kathmandu Dhading and Nuwakot and locals from Sisdol and Banchare Danda had signed a four-point agreement which paved the way for easing the garbage management.

As per the agreement the tippers transporting the garbage must not leak the liquid waste while reaching the landfill site. Currently there are only 75 tippers with Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) which are not leaky. They transport the waste twice a day.

KMC is planning to take in rent 150 more tippers so that the way that leads to landfill sites would not be littered with liquid waste added Lamsal. The garbage collection has begun after the agreement. KMC has further planned to use 300 tippers to collect and manage the valley waste.

The embattled large bank Wells Fargo (WFC 0.66%) has really been down and out since its phony-accounts scandal came to light in 2016. That resulted in numerous lawsuits and fines as well as a lot of work to repair the bank's reputation and regulatory infrastructure.

But after bringing on Wall Street veteran Charlie Scharf in 2019 to run the bank Wells Fargo has undeniably started to make progress with the stock more than doubling since its pandemic lows in late 2020. It currently trades with around a $172 billion market cap; can the bank get to $1 trillion over the next decade? Let's take a look.

What needs to happen

Following revelations of the phony-accounts scandal in which employees at the bank opened credit card and depository accounts for customers without their consent the Federal Reserve imposed an asset cap on the bank in 2018 limiting balance-sheet growth.

More than four years later the cap is still in place and has cost the bank billions of dollars in profits at a minimum. Clearly for Wells Fargo to grow as it can and really start to generate strong returns it needs the asset cap to be removed.

It seems like the asset cap could still remain for a while given that the bank has nine outstanding consent orders and Scharf has said that you can partially track the bank's progress by looking at how the consent orders start to expire or get terminated. But getting the asset cap removed is Wells Fargo's top priority and management does seem to be making progress; I'd expect the bank to be able to get the cap removed within the next few years. Once it is removed Wells Fargo will be able to trim more costs and grow revenue faster which will accelerate profits from the current pace.

Even with the asset cap in place Scharf has formed a plan to cut out $10 billion of annual costs a process that is now well underway...and working. This along with higher interest rates can help the bank get a lot more efficient and drive much better returns. Scharf has said the goal is to exit this year with a run rate of a 10% return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) and then reach 15% as more of a medium-term goal. Asset cap or no asset cap the bank is improving and making strides toward much better financial results.

The path to $1 trillion

Banks tend to trade relative to their tangible book value (TBV or net worth) so the faster they can grow TBV the better. Top banks in Wells Fargo's peer group like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America can reach 200% or 250% of their TBV in good times. When the asset cap wasn't in place Wells Fargo was growing TBV at a fast clip:

Between 2012 and now even with the asset cap Wells Fargo still grew its TBV by about 68%.

That's pretty good considering we know the asset cap has cost the bank billions in profits. Scharf is also building out what could be a much more profitable bank by focusing growth on areas like credit card lending and investment banking. His cost-cutting initiatives will also bolster profits as well.

If the bank could generate a 15% ROTCE and consistently produce that for nine or 10 years then Wells Fargo could in theory grow its tangible book value to somewhere close to $500 billion by 2032 if you figure in compounded growth. And then if the bank could trade at 200% or 250% of its TBV like other top banks then it could have somewhere near a $1 trillion market cap.

Will it happen?

Obviously there are many factors at play here like when Wells Fargo gets the asset cap removed and can really start to grow the balance sheet and get its returns closer to a 15% ROTCE. Wells Fargo still has a strong franchise and I have confidence in Scharf's ability to execute.

But I think it's likely to take at least two or three years to go from a 10% to a 15% ROTCE. Then maintaining consistent returns over a long period of time will not be easy especially because banks are so linked to the economy and are therefore affected by the broader economic environment and macro policy. Furthermore capital returns to shareholders will also slow the growth of tangible book value.

Ultimately I wouldn't call it impossible for Wells Fargo to achieve a $1 trillion market cap by the year 2032. But I think it's very unlikely given that we don't know when the asset cap will be removed and that there is little room for error for the bank to reach $1 trillion. Still I think that over the next decade Wells Fargo can be a very solid investment that investors should definitely consider.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vbGV2aXR0b3dubm93LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzIwL2NoZWNrZXJzLWZhc3QtZm9vZC1yZXN0YXVyYW50LWNvbnZlbmllbmNlLXN0b3JlLWFwcHJvdmVkLWZvci1jcm95ZG9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Checkers Fast-Food Restaurant Convenience Store Approved For Croydon,"A rendering of the proposed Checkers.

Plans for fast-food chain Checkers to open a location in Bristol Township’s Croydon section were greenlit Thursday evening.

Bristol Township Council approved plans for franchisee ARAR Foods LLC to open a 1200-square-foot Checkers and a joined 2400-square-foot convivence store for the now-closed Wells Fargo branch at 399 Route 13.

The plan calls for remodeling the building and reconstructing it to fit the needs of the fast food joint and convivence store said David Shafkowitz an attorney for ARAR Foods LLC.

The township has approved a waiver for 33 parking spots in place of the 44 required by ordinance.

The Checkers will have a drive-thru lane for customers.

The developer previously told the township would be no indoor seating but there would be a small area for seating outside.

The developer also told officials in the past the site would reduce impervious service of the mostly paved lot by adding some greenery.

Council President Craig Bowen welcomed the businesses to the township and joked that they should bring some treats to public meetings.

Shafkowitz said cleanup of the site could begin in as soon as 10 days.

ARAR Foods LLC has already purchased the bank site for just over $1 million according to county property records.

In the past Checkers operated a location at the corner of Woodbourne and Bristol Oxford Valley roads in the Levittown section of Middletown Township. That location closed in 2013.

The Wells Fargo building was previously owned by Farmers National Bank of Bucks County in the 1950s. Farmers National Bank of Bucks County was purchased by Fidelity Bank in the late 1950s. Through the years and acquisitions the location was a First Union branch a Wachovia and finally a Wells Fargo.

The ""aggressive retool"" ended up pretty passive Joel Farabee and Bobby Brink got hurt before they even hit the ice goaltender Ivan Fedotov is stuck in an extremely concerning situation in Russia Ryan Ellis' status is still a mystery and whoever wasn't injured from the total mess that was last season is left trying to prove that their struggles were exceptions not the rule.

And oh by the way the fourth worst team in the league last season is more than $2.5 million over the salary cap as of Saturday.

Can things turn around? Maybe. The chances aren't totally at zero and the Flyers at least publically facing are banking on health and new coach John Tortorella to pull that off.

But ask most fans right now and the vibe is in complete shambles and on Thursday we got actual data to back that up...

A vote of no confidence

The Athletic turned to its readers to help rank the confidence in the front office of all 32 teams in the NHL. With more than 18000 responses grades were doled out in the following categories: roster building cap management drafting and development trading free agency and vision.

How did the Flyers do?

Oh boy...

Straight D-minuses seem a bit generous honestly.

What hockey analytics writer Dom Luszczyszyn had to add about the Flyers:

So … this wasn’t even close. Flyers fans are angry and the sheer ineptitude is easy to spot from the outside. The Flyers’ total score by its own fans was 0.6 points lower than the next worst team and the team’s report card is straight D-minuses. There is nothing currently redeeming about the way the Flyers are doing business. This wasn’t a small group of fans either. The Flyers fan base had 1000 respondents the fourth highest of any team. The Flyers faithful are mad and they want it to be known. They’re a bottom-five team that is somehow over the salary cap. None of their contracts are easily moveable making it impossible to sign an elite homegrown talent that might have actually moved the franchise back in the right direction. There is nothing positive on the horizon here — it’s a big mess that will not only be extremely difficult to clean up it’s a big mess that was almost entirely preventable when each major decision was made. The Flyers are what happens when a person superglues their hand to a wall because they think it’ll help them climb it. Now they’re just stuck. [The Athletic]

The vibe is in shambles.

WJC Update

Usually played at Christmas time the World Junior Championship out in Alberta was canceled after barely getting off the ground due to COVID-19.

The IIHF and Hockey Canada opted to give the tournament another go this month but you'd be forgiven if you had no idea it was even happening. Not even Canada as a nation seems all that invested (and they LOVE World Juniors up there) with sparsely attended games and Hockey Canada itself embroiled in a massive sexual abuse scandal stemming from incidents going back to 2003 and 2018.

A handful of Flyers prospects are participating in take 2 of the tournament though with a couple of them making some big noise.

Swedish defenseman Emil Andrae the 54th overall draft pick in 2020 stole the show along the blueline with four goals and four assists (eight points) through six games before Finland blanked Team Sweden 1-0 in the semifinal.

Some highlights:

Center Tyson Foerster the 23rd overall pick by the Flyers in 2020 is also having a big tournament with three goals and three assists through six games for Team Canada.

Andrae will get one more chance to make an impact on the international stage when Sweden plays the Czech Republic for the bronze medal at 4 p.m. ET on Saturday.

Foerster will try to help Canada win the gold medal against Finland soon after at 8 p.m. ET.

Both prospects are 20 years old but likely have a bit more to go before they're ready for the NHL.

Andrae will return to Sweden after the tournament to play for the pro club HV71 in the SHL where he's expected to develop under a much bigger role per The Athletic's Scott Wheeler. Andrae will not attend Flyers training camp.

Foerster meanwhile is coming off major shoulder surgery and is looking to prove that he can stay healthy while getting his development back on track. He was at the Flyers' development camp in July and his showing at the World Juniors has definitely been promising.

The likelihood is he'll start the year with the Lehigh Valley Phantoms in the AHL but time with the Flyers this season isn't entirely out of the question either.

“You’re always trying to come in here and make the big squad’’ Foerster told the Wayne Fish for The Morning Call. “That’s what I will try to do.’’



Left winger Elliot Desnoyers the Flyers' 2020 fifth-round pick is also playing for Team Canada but has only one assist and defenseman Brian Zanetti a 2021 fourth-rounder put up two helpers in four games for Team Switzerland.

What are those?

James van Riemsdyk is playing in the offseason's Da Beauty League and showed up to Minnesota with a new pair of gloves.

The Flyers' glove colorway is usually black all the way through with the manufacturer name (Bauer CCM Warrior etc.) written across the wrist guard in white. They also carried another set of gloves with orange accents to match with their black third jerseys but those seemed to disappear late into last season.

The gloves van Riemsdyk has now are black too but with a white wrist guard and orange embroidery across it.

Check it out below:

New defenseman Tony DeAngelo was also seen with the same style of gloves at a charity event in Voorhees last weekend.

Adidas the NHL's uniform manufacturer is bringing back the Reverse Retro uniform program this season and the new gloves might be the first hint at what the Flyers are going for.

The league isn't expected to reveal the new line of unis for a while but a few designs – Vancouver Chicago New Jersey Edmonton the Islanders Tampa Bay Winnipeg and San Jose – have already leaked and if interested you can check them out or at least get any idea of how they're going to look via Icethetics' video report below:

Sahith Theegala was candid in his post-round interview at the BMW Championship. Getty Images

Sahith Theegala was candid. He was sincere. Even after a final-round 68 at the BMW Championship that firmed up his spot in next week’s Tour Championship as a rookie he said he still doesn’t feel like he belongs on the PGA Tour.

“Even yesterday I was walking up 18 hit my 5-wood in the right rough which is so standard there and I was just — I turned to [caddie] Carl [Smith] I was like it’s incredible how much better I could get and how bad” Theegala said matter-of-factly Sunday at Wilmington Country Club. “I totally agree some parts of my game have been incredible this year but just playing with some of these guys they are so good and seeing different facets of their game that I feel like I can improve so much more in every area of the game.”

In a way so rarely seen on the PGA Tour Theegala peeled back the curtain on what emotions he felt with a spot in the Tour Championship on the line.

He started the day on the number projected 30th in the FedEx Cup standings. Top 30 get to play in the Tour Championship and all that comes with it: a berth in all four of next year’s major championships and the Players Championship and exemptions into the Genesis Invitational Arnold Palmer Invitational and Memorial which will have increased $20 million purses next season. And then there’s the ridiculous purse for FedEx Cup in which the winner at East Lake takes home $18 million.

Even next week’s 30th (last) place finisher gets a check for $300k.

Theegala admitted he was feeling the nerves on the morning of the final round.

“I had my best friend Roy with me this week and it was cool having him by my side. But I was nervous” he said. “I had a little bit of the shakes warming up. I couldn’t hold my hands still. I felt great mindset-wise but just body-wise I knew something big was on the line.

He said his birdie on the opening hole helped settle those nerves.

But even Theegala who’s successful rookie campaign featured a couple of close calls with top-3 finishes at Phoenix and Hartford said the pressure of trying to make a Tour Championship was just as much as trying to win a tournament.

So often we heard this week of pros saying their mindset was take care of business at this tournament and the FedEx Cup standing would take care of itself. On Sunday Theegala might as well have said the opposite.

“I’m in 30th place out of 70 people and I’m as nervous as if I were near the lead” Theegala said. “It was definitely different and it definitely felt like a tournament within a tournament. That putt on the last hole just felt so big. It really felt like some of the putts I had made coming down the stretch when I was near the lead there.”

He wasn’t really ever close. His 68 put him at 7-under for the week good for a tie for 15th but seven strokes back of winner Patrick Cantlay. Nevertheless the nerves were still there and that’s what made the week fun for Theegala.

“Oh that’s what it’s all about. The fact that you’re even in that position to feel nerves is a good thing” he said. “I think that’s something I tell a lot of guys is like hey if you’re nervous that’s such a good feeling. Imagine not being nervous then what you’re doing kind of thing. Obviously there’s a fine line between serious nervousness and anxiety and comfortability and finding that line is tough but yeah just pressure is a privilege and I sure felt that way today.”

His round couldn’t have done anything to alleviate any of those nerves. He hit only one fairway but somehow managed 13 greens mostly hitting out of Wilmington Country Club’s deep rough and made five birdies in order to secure his tie for 15th. Four of those five came in the last seven holes to move from outside the Top-30 in the FedEx Cup to No. 28 in the standings punching his ticket to Atlanta.

But there were notable moments outside of the birdies coming down the stretch.

“Sixteen it was my bread and butter kind of the low stinger fade that I hit with a 3-iron all year and just squirted right on me and hit a tree like 160 yards off the tee” Theegala said. “I was just so frustrated there. I was like come on this is the one chance — I still hadn’t hit a fairway to that point so I caught a great lie in the rough.

“I had like 210 or 220 to the hole. I was just trying to blast it over the green. Blasted it over the green had a tough lie but knew it was an easy chip so chipped it in there to three feet which was great.”

Then the crescendo of for Theegala came on after finally finding the fairway for the only time all day.

“Best tee shot I’ve hit in a long time. I think I had like 70 yards in. Hit a horrible pitch there. I was like oh great I hit a fairway and now I whiff the wedge” Theegala said. “But I just had a good feeling over that putt. I hadn’t really made any long putts this week and it had a nice look to it and I didn’t have to hit it too hard because it was a touch downhill and it was just tracking the whole way. I gave a pretty big fist pump which I’ve been holding in for seems like over a month now.

“I can’t remember the last time I fist pumped so that was cool.”

His 37-footer got him to 7-under for the week the number which would eventually prove critical for him if he could stay there.

He missed the green on 18 and needed to get up and down from short and right of the green.

“I felt very comfortable that I’d get it up-and-down. I didn’t know how I would” Theegala said. “But the fact that it was left to what I feel is the strongest part of my game was fitting. [I] hit a decent chip. I was nervous on that for sure but left myself an easy putt and it was really satisfying to hit my line on that one.”

He may not have remembered his last fist pump before 17 but it didn’t take long for his next one after he drained the 7-footer on 18 for par and to get in the clubhouse at 7-under.

However his season is not over and he will play for the $75 million in FedEx Cup bonus money in Atlanta with the rest of the top-30.

“I think the validation of the season it’s another step for me to feel like I really belong because I still don’t feel like I’m really there at the top of the game” Theegala said. “Slowly building confidence every week whether it’s a good or bad week. I feel like I’ve made a lot of progress.

“It would mean the world to make the Tour Championship and stand along 29 of the other best golfers in the world.”

He’s come along from his initial goal at the start of the season.

“The fact that I’m even on the PGA Tour is pretty absurd” Theegala admitted. “My only expectation was really to keep my card and obviously I’ve blown that out of the water.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXNtb2luZXNyZWdpc3Rlci5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9pb3dhLXN0YXRlLWZhaXIvMjAyMi8wOC8yMS9rZWl0aC11cmJhbi1wZWZvcm1zLTIwMjItaW93YS1zdGF0ZS1mYWlyLWdyYW5kc3RhbmQtY29uY2VydC1jb3VudHJ5LW11c2ljLzEwMjg2MTE0MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Keith Urban performs in concert at the 2022 Iowa State Fair Grandstand,"Keith Urban didn't light up the Iowa State Fair Grandstand stage on Saturday; he asked his fans to.

Near the end of his performance the country music star cut the lights on stage and asked 13711 audience members how they might go about seeing him and his band.

""Iowa this is proof positive that what we cannot do alone we can sure as hell do together"" Urban said as lights from cellphones increasingly illuminated the night. ""Don't fall for the divide and conquer stuff guys. We are better together.""

After years of waiting thousands of Urban's fans got a little bit of everything from the country artist on Saturday night.

Urban had been announced as a performer at the 2021 Grandstand but had to cancel replaced by Dan + Shay. He'd also planned to perform at the 2020 State Fair which was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Urban has played central Iowa before including a performance at Des Moines' Wells Fargo Arena in late 2013.

Over the course of a night on stage filled with dazzling lights and adrenaline-fueled chords the Australian singer performed his hits including ""Wild Hearts"" ""John Cougar John Deere John 3:16"" and ""Somewhere In My Car.""

Ingrid Andress opened for Urban previewing many of the new songs from her upcoming album ""Good Person"" which comes out on Friday.

""I had a very large turkey leg today and I don't know if I'm ever gonna recover. It was delicious though"" Andress told the crowd after mentioning that this performance marked her first time at the State Fair. ""Guess I'll have to come back.""

Andress who previously came through central Iowa for 2021's Big Country Bash performed ""More Hearts Than Mine"" and ""Wishful Drinking"" a collaboration with Sam Hunt as well as ""Waste of Lime"" and ""Falling For You"" a song she said she'd never played for an audience before.

""We used to stay in Des Moines all the time because my dad was a strength coach for Major League Baseball so we would have to drive from Colorado"" Andress said.

""Des Moines holds a special place in my heart because that usually meant that we got KFC for dinner and got to swim in an indoor swimming pool. So it was a highlight of our road trips which tells you a lot about me honestly.""

Urban displayed one of the traditions of ""The Speed of Now World"" Tour at the State Fair.

""Every night when we get to track 10 we do a different song a random song"" Urban explained as a digital wheel spun to the song ""Say Something."" ""Because you all want to hear different things... we could be here for three days playing music.""

As the crowd roared approvingly at the prospect of 72 hours of Urban the musician joked ""OK I'll call home and tell them I'll be a little late.""

The concert ended with fireworks and after confetti showered the audience the stage lights stayed up as Urban and his band took bows.

NeuRRAM  a new chip that runs computations directly in memory and can run a wide variety of AI applications has been designed and built by an international team of researchers. What sets it apart is that it does this all at a fraction of the energy consumed by computing platforms for general-purpose AI computing.

The NeuRRAM neuromorphic chip brings AI a step closer to running on a broad range of edge devices disconnected from the cloud. This means they can perform sophisticated cognitive tasks anywhere and anytime without relying on a network connection to a centralized server. Applications for this device abound in every corner of the globe and every facet of our lives. They range from smartwatches to VR headsets smart earbuds smart sensors in factories and rovers for space exploration.

Not only is the NeuRRAM chip twice as energy efficient as the state-of-the-art “compute-in-memory” chips an innovative class of hybrid chips that runs computations in memory it also delivers results that are just as accurate as conventional digital chips. Conventional AI platforms are much bulkier and typically are constrained to using large data servers operating in the cloud.

Additionally the NeuRRAM chip is highly versatile and supports many different neural network models and architectures. As a result the chip can be used for many different applications including image recognition and reconstruction as well as voice recognition.

“The conventional wisdom is that the higher efficiency of compute-in-memory is at the cost of versatility but our NeuRRAM chip obtains efficiency while not sacrificing versatility” said Weier Wan the paper’s first corresponding author and a recent Ph.D. graduate of Stanford University who worked on the chip while at UC San Diego where he was co-advised by Gert Cauwenberghs in the Department of Bioengineering.

The research team co-led by bioengineers at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) presented their results in the August 17 issue of Nature.

Currently AI computing is both power-hungry and computationally expensive. Most AI applications on edge devices involve moving data from the devices to the cloud where the AI processes and analyzes it. Then the results are transferred back to the device. This is necessary because most edge devices are battery-powered and as a result only have a limited amount of power that can be dedicated to computing.

By reducing the power consumption needed for AI inference at the edge this NeuRRAM chip could lead to more robust smarter and accessible edge devices and smarter manufacturing. It could also lead to better data privacy because the transfer of data from devices to the cloud comes with increased security risks.

On AI chips moving data from memory to computing units is one major bottleneck.

“It’s the equivalent of doing an eight-hour commute for a two-hour work day” Wan said.

To solve this data transfer issue researchers used what is known as resistive random-access memory. This type of non-volatile memory allows for computation directly within memory rather than in separate computing units. RRAM and other emerging memory technologies used as synapse arrays for neuromorphic computing were pioneered in the lab of Philip Wong Wan’s advisor at Stanford and one of the main contributors to this work. Although computation with RRAM chips is not necessarily new generally it leads to a decrease in the accuracy of the computations performed on the chip and a lack of flexibility in the chip’s architecture.

“Compute-in-memory has been common practice in neuromorphic engineering since it was introduced more than 30 years ago” Cauwenberghs said. “What is new with NeuRRAM is that the extreme efficiency now goes together with great flexibility for diverse AI applications with almost no loss in accuracy over standard digital general-purpose compute platforms.”

A carefully crafted methodology was key to the work with multiple levels of “co-optimization” across the abstraction layers of hardware and software from the design of the chip to its configuration to run various AI tasks. Additionally the team made sure to account for various constraints that span from memory device physics to circuits and network architecture.

“This chip now provides us with a platform to address these problems across the stack from devices and circuits to algorithms” said Siddharth Joshi an assistant professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Notre Dame who started working on the project as a Ph.D. student and postdoctoral researcher in Cauwenberghs lab at UCSD.

Chip performance

Researchers measured the chip’s energy efficiency by a measure known as energy-delay product or EDP. EDP combines both the amount of energy consumed for every operation and the amount of time it takes to complete the operation. By this measure the NeuRRAM chip achieves 1.6 to 2.3 times lower EDP (lower is better) and 7 to 13 times higher computational density than state-of-the-art chips.

Engineers ran various AI tasks on the chip. It achieved 99% accuracy on a handwritten digit recognition task; 85.7% on an image classification task; and 84.7% on a Google speech command recognition task. In addition the chip also achieved a 70% reduction in image-reconstruction error on an image-recovery task. These results are comparable to existing digital chips that perform computation under the same bit-precision but with drastic savings in energy.

One key contribution of the paper the researchers point out is that all the results featured are obtained directly on the hardware. In many previous works of compute-in-memory chips AI benchmark results were often obtained partially by software simulation.

Next steps include improving architectures and circuits and scaling the design to more advanced technology nodes. Engineers also plan to tackle other applications such as spiking neural networks.

“We can do better at the device level improve circuit design to implement additional features and address diverse applications with our dynamic NeuRRAM platform” said Rajkumar Kubendran an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh who started work on the project while a Ph.D. student in Cauwenberghs’ research group at UCSD.

In addition Wan is a founding member of a startup that works on productizing the compute-in-memory technology. “As a researcher and an engineer my ambition is to bring research innovations from labs into practical use” Wan said.

New architecture

The key to NeuRRAM’s energy efficiency is an innovative method to sense output in memory. Conventional approaches use voltage as input and measure current as the result. But this leads to the need for more complex and more power-hungry circuits. In NeuRRAM the team engineered a neuron circuit that senses voltage and performs analog-to-digital conversion in an energy-efficient manner. This voltage-mode sensing can activate all the rows and all the columns of an RRAM array in a single computing cycle allowing higher parallelism.

In the NeuRRAM architecture CMOS neuron circuits are physically interleaved with RRAM weights. It differs from conventional designs where CMOS circuits are typically on the peripheral of RRAM weights. The neuron’s connections with the RRAM array can be configured to serve as either input or output of the neuron. This allows neural network inference in various data flow directions without incurring overheads in area or power consumption. This in turn makes the architecture easier to reconfigure.

To make sure that the accuracy of the AI computations can be preserved across various neural network architectures engineers developed a set of hardware algorithm co-optimization techniques. The techniques were verified on various neural networks including convolutional neural networks long short-term memory and restricted Boltzmann machines.

As a neuromorphic AI chip NeuroRRAM performs parallel distributed processing across 48 neurosynaptic cores. To simultaneously achieve high versatility and high efficiency NeuRRAM supports data-parallelism by mapping a layer in the neural network model onto multiple cores for parallel inference on multiple data. Also NeuRRAM offers model-parallelism by mapping different layers of a model onto different cores and performing inference in a pipelined fashion.

An international research team

The work is the result of an international team of researchers.

The UCSD team designed the CMOS circuits that implement the neural functions interfacing with the RRAM arrays to support the synaptic functions in the chip’s architecture for high efficiency and versatility. Wan working closely with the entire team implemented the design; characterized the chip; trained the AI models; and executed the experiments. Wan also developed a software toolchain that maps AI applications onto the chip.

The RRAM synapse array and its operating conditions were extensively characterized and optimized at Stanford University.

The RRAM array was fabricated and integrated onto CMOS at Tsinghua University.

The Team at Notre Dame contributed to both the design and architecture of the chip and the subsequent machine learning model design and training.

The research started as part of the National Science Foundation funded Expeditions in Computing project on Visual Cortex on Silicon at Penn State University with continued funding support from the Office of Naval Research Science of AI program the Semiconductor Research Corporation and DARPA JUMP program and Western Digital Corporation.

In the past ten days subscribers to Instagram and WhatsApp who use two-step authentication for signing into their accounts have reported that they are not receiving the required authentication codes via text message. Text message codes are also required for creating new accounts.

Many suspect that Iran’s mobile operators are blocking text messages containing keywords including “code” “Telegram” “WhatsApp” and “Instagram”.

A majority of Iranian lawmakers issued a statement in January asking the government and the Judiciary for measures to restrict peoples’ activities on the internet. In February an ad hoc parliamentary committee approved the outline of a controversial bill ironically titled Legislation to Protect Cyberspace Users’ Rights to limit access to various apps and platforms.

Many Iranians including some lawmakers say the implementation of the plan has practically been in progress in the past few months. Authorities have restricted bandwidth allocated to Instagram in the past few months and reduced Internet speed both of which make connecting to social media platforms difficult.

According to information technology expert Arian Eghbal the recent disruption in access to Instagram and other platforms is deliberate. “There is evidence that our [filtering] system is working like China’s” he told Entekhab news website on August 17.

An Instagram online training course advertised in Iran for millions whose small businesses depend on the scial media network

The slow internet has affected many areas of life from navigation of taxis and cars to tens of thousands of large and small online businesses that rely on Instagram as well as government and public online services.

“They are restricting access to the Internet to make communication between people harder … Those who wrote the Siyanat bill don't want people to conjoin in the cyberspace talk to each other and discuss social and political issues” Gholamreza Nouri-Ghezeljeh chairman of the Independents’ Faction in the parliament told Salam-e No website earlier this month.

Canada-based science and technology reporter Mehdi Sarami told Iran International that the government is quietly implementing the yet unapproved legislation to force people to use domestically developed platforms such as Soroush and Rubika which can easily be controlled.

A survey conducted by the state-run Iranian Students Polling Agency (ISPA) in 2021 found that 73.6% of Iranians over the age of 18 use social media including WhatsApp (64.1) Instagram (45.3) and Telegram (36.3). Only 4.8% reported that they use domestically developed platforms. Many of Instagram’s subscribers in Iran use it for business.

Instagram with around 45 million users is the only major social media platform not blocked in the country where other platforms such as Facebook YouTube WhatsApp Twitter and Telegram cannot be accessed without the use of anti-filtering software and VPNs (virtual private networks).

Nearly every Iranian with a smartphone has installed anti-filtering software that allows access to filtered applications and websites. Anti-filtering software however will time out if the internet speed is low. Nonetheless with over 50 million users WhatsApp is the most popular messaging application in Iran.

Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has multiple accounts on Instagram and Twitter but his loyal followers are behind the efforts to restrict access for citizens.

Iran has one of the world’s worst internet censorships with tens of thousands of websites blocked since the early 2000s and most social media platforms banned. In the absence of free media and heavy censorship many Iranians turn to social media for political news and information.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vZWFzdGFzaWFmb3J1bS5vcmcvMjAyMi8wOC8yMC9kZXZlbG9waW5nLWFzaWEtc3BvaWxlZC1mb3ItaW5mcmFzdHJ1Y3R1cmUtY2hvaWNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Developing Asia spoiled for infrastructure choice,"China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is estimated to have invested US$4 trillion in infrastructure projects worldwide from 2013–2020. Its funding was a welcome development — albeit one that was tinged by concerns over China’s rising influence. Western governments share these concerns and have since offered alternatives to the BRI. The PGII is arguably the most detailed of these initiatives but there are many questions about its viability.

It is unclear whether plans to mobilise private capital to fund infrastructure will succeed. A history of unfulfilled efforts also means that Western infrastructure initiatives have a credibility problem. Yet the West still intends to compete with China on infrastructure development. Developing countries should harness this competition by using rival offers to demand higher standards from partners to meet their needs.

The PGII offers an interesting value proposition for developing economies. Compared to the BRI’s general focus on hard infrastructure the PGII’s priority pillars include climate security digital connectivity gender equality and health security. These are areas in which Western companies may hold a comparative advantage over their Chinese counterparts particularly in providing clean energy solutions. They also align better with development needs like those articulated in ASEAN’s call for better health systems inclusive digital transformation and sustainable energy as part of the COVID-19 Comprehensive Recovery Framework in 2020.

The G7’s pledge to provide US$600 billion in infrastructure funding by mobilising private capital is notable as well. Insurance and pension funds are a relatively untapped source of funding for infrastructure projects and could help developing countries to close the infrastructure gap. The benefits of a US$40 million investment in Southeast Asian power networks for example would be magnified if the project could attain its goal of mobilising US$2 billion in private capital.

Concerns about the PGII’s viability are numerous. Its emphasis on gender equality may struggle to find roots in developing Asia. And despite the United States having a long history of mobilising private capital under the Overseas Private Investment Corporation the risks associated with infrastructure projects have traditionally made them very unpopular with private investors.

Yet the PGII’s credibility problem is arguably more serious. This is not so much the result of geopolitics as it is the poor track record of non-Chinese infrastructure initiatives. With the exception of Japan’s Partnership for Quality Infrastructure initiatives such as the European Union Connectivity Strategy for Europe and Asia and the EU–India Connectivity Partnership seem to have stagnated or been unceremoniously repackaged under new titles.

The difference in the visibility of the BRI and Western initiatives is also striking. China has dozens of noteworthy projects across Southeast Asia from high-speed railways to hydropower plants while most casual observers would be hard-pressed to name more than one Western project in the region.

There is no consensus on whether the PGII will succeed or fail. But despite unsurprisingly low expectations about the initiative developing Asia should keep an eye on the PGII. The presence of two viable financing models will allow recipient countries to bargain for better deals.

Developing countries are said to prefer the looser requirements of BRI projects but their governments have shown independent judgement in choosing non-Chinese infrastructure partners or renegotiating existing agreements. Vietnam and Indonesia have engaged Japan and China on separate railway projects while leaders from the Philippines and Malaysia have pushed to renegotiate loan agreements with Beijing.

Meanwhile Western governments are likely to ramp up criticism of the BRI regardless of what happens with the PGII particularly over governance scandals and the rising indebtedness of countries such as Laos. China denies these claims but remains sensitive about its international image taking steps to address some of its overseas investment practices as early as 2017.

During a BRI conference in 2019 Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged to rein in corruption and boost transparency around the BRI. He then publicly announced in September 2021 that China would ‘not build new coal-fired power projects abroad’. Loud complaints from developing economies about governance problems could compel Beijing to hasten its reform efforts some of which remain unfulfilled.

Developing countries have a golden opportunity to take advantage of the rivalry between Western and non-Western initiatives. Even if they intend on rejecting Western proposals recipient governments can use them as leverage to hold China to its reform promises. It will take deft leadership to avoid the temptation of the cheapest offer — but persevering could bring developing Asia one step closer to bridging its infrastructure gap in a sustainable fashion.

Oil stocks tend to be volatile due to uncertainties in the oil markets which often experience elongated periods of boom and bust. Losing faith in the viability of oil and gas as an energy source and selling stocks when the markets aren't favorable can prove to be a costly mistake. If you plan to invest in energy stocks you should have a long-term investment horizon.

Let's look at why keeping a long-term horizon is important and the top stocks you can buy and hold for the next decade and beyond.

Fluctuations in oil prices

Over the past two decades Brent crude oil prices fluctuated significantly -- from over $120 per barrel to below $40 per barrel. Domestic benchmark West Texas Intermediate also moved largely in tandem with the global prices.

Indeed profits that the integrated oil and gas companies such as ExxonMobil (XOM 1.97%) and Chevron (CVX 1.79%) make when oil prices are $120 per barrel are quite different from those made if prices fall below $40 per barrel. The performance of oil and gas stocks over the last 10-year period was not impressive largely due to low energy commodity prices.

As the chart shows top oil and gas stocks -- ExxonMobil Chevron Kinder Morgan (KMI 1.06%) Williams Companies (WMB 0.66%) and Enterprise Products Partners (EPD 0.84%) -- underperformed the S&P 500 Index over this period. Notably the chart starts in 2012 when oil and energy stock prices were very high. Still the recent rise in energy stock prices has boosted the returns on these stocks back into the green.

Let's move back a little to see how energy stocks have fared over the last two decades. Kinder Morgan is eliminated because it didn't go public until 2011.

Chevron Williams Companies and Enterprise Products Partners outperformed the S&P 500 Index in total returns over the last 20 years. If we go back further the top performers change again. Still most stocks outperformed the market.

Notably all five stocks outperformed the broader market in the last year.

The takeaway is that if you invest in strong well-managed energy companies with diversified assets and hold the stocks long term you'll generate handsome returns while diversifying your portfolio.

Top energy stocks

Chevron and ExxonMobil are among the largest integrated oil companies in the world. Both have been operating for decades generating handsome returns for their shareholders. Both Chevron and ExxonMobil are Dividend Aristocrats with Chevron raising its dividend for 35 years in a row and ExxonMobil for 39. Although some investors may prefer one over the other there are several things to like about both.

If you don't like integrated oil stocks' volatile earnings and prices you can consider companies operating in the midstream energy space. These companies are primarily involved in transporting and storing oil gas and natural gas liquids. Their earnings are relatively stable compared to oil and gas producers as they typically generate fee-based cash flow based on volumes transported or stored.

Enterprise Products Partners Kinder Morgan and Williams Companies are among the top midstream stocks to consider buying now. Regular dividend income contributed significantly to the handsome total returns these stocks generated over years as discussed above.

Enterprise Products Partners stock offers an attractive distribution yield of 6.9%. The company has been growing its dividend for 24 consecutive years and looks well placed to continue growing them in the years to come.

Kinder Morgan stock offers a dividend yield of 5.9%. The expected demand growth for natural gas offers visible growth opportunities for Kinder Morgan in the coming decades. At the same time the company is looking to expand its operations in the renewable energy space. Likewise Williams Companies is focused on high-return expansion projects and the stock offers an attractive yield of 4.9%. In all investing in these five energy stocks for the long term could significantly enhance your portfolio returns.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNwb3J0c3Rlci5jb20vd3Jlc3RsZXJzLWNoYW5nZWQtcHJvbW90aW9ucy1mZWxsLW9mZi10aGUtbWFwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Wrestlers Who Changed Promotions And Completely Fell Off The Map,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNwb3J0c3Rlci5jb20vd3Jlc3RsZXJzLWNoYW5nZWQtcHJvbW90aW9ucy1mZWxsLW9mZi10aGUtbWFwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZWF0c2hlZXQuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvdGhlLWNoYWxsZW5nZS11c2EtbGVvLXRlbW9yeS1naXJsZnJpZW5kLWNsYXJpZmllcy1waG9uZS1jYWxsLmh0bWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'The Challenge: USA': Leo Temory's Girlfriend Clarifies Phone Call: 'We Were Both Overwhelmed',"The Amazing Race star Leo Temory left behind his businesses to compete in The Challenge: USA. One episode featured a heated phone call with his girlfriend who wanted to come home as the companies weren’t doing well. Following the episode she clarified the call and blamed production for editing things out.

Leo Temory’s girlfriend called him about his businesses during ‘The Challenge: USA’ episode 7

During the August 18 episode of The Challenge: USA Leo Temory had a heated phone call with his girlfriend. Apparently she took care of his businesses while he was competing but issues caused them to lose money every day totaling over $40000 at the time.

His girlfriend was upset as she felt he should be home running the day-to-day operations and seemingly wanted him to quit to return and take care of things. Therefore Leo packed his bags and got ready to leave until his teammate Alyssa Lopez convinced him to stay as his exit might affect her spot in the game.

Following the episode his girlfriend Alia posted a screenshot of a message written in her Notes app to her Instagram story. She claimed the viewers don’t know what happened “behind the scenes” noting that “uncommon issues” with the businesses were happening at the time.

Additionally she accused production of preventing Leo from having “business calls that they already agreed on.” His girlfriend admitted “we were both overwhelmed” as she also had a full-time job. Alia claimed the show cut and edited the scenes pointing out that their phone call and his attempt to leave happened on different days. “He wasn’t even wearing the same outfit” she noted.

Leo has won two eliminations during ‘The Challenge: USA’

The 36-year-old Los Angeles native entered The Challenge: USA alongside only three others representing The Amazing Race franchise including runner-up Cayla Lee and winner James Wallington.

They were immediate targets but Leo remained safe. He had a history of people not wanting to team up with him due to his lack of focus and Sarah Lacina was no different.

However the two had to work together during episode 5 when they were blindsided into elimination as winning couple Tyson Apostol and Cashay Proudfoot wanted to take a shot at the Survivor champ. They came out on top eliminating Azah Awasum and Cinco Holland Jr.

He remained safe until a couple of episodes later when he and Alyssa finished at the bottom earning a spot in the elimination round. The team sent Kyland Young and Kyra Green home and stole the money in their bank account bringing Leo up to $9000 the fourth most remaining contestant.

Leo initially appeared on ‘The Amazing Race’

In 2013 Leo and his cousin Jamal Zadran the “Afghanimals” competed on The Amazing Race 23 where they immediately made their mark with their boisterous personalities.

The team was U-Turned twice but survived the first team to do so ultimately placing fourth. They returned for the following season All-Stars where they focused more on their social game.

Although it worked as they avoided getting U-Turned the duo placed fourth again. The cousins returned for a third and likely final time in 2019 for The Amazing Race 31 where they implemented their initial strategy.

Even though they struggled throughout the season the duo finished with their placement in third.

Kendrick Lamar offered up a highly artful visually stunning 100-minute performance at Xcel Energy Center one that somehow combined modern dance psychotherapy a ventriloquist dummy and even COVID testing — all without missing a beat.

The truly clever shadowy stage production was no indicator the music itself lacked wow value. Simply put: The only rapper to win a Pulitzer Prize once again lived up to the hype as the greatest in his field at the moment.

Coming a month into the tour behind his fifth album ""Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers"" Saturday's show was Lamar's second time packing St. Paul hockey's arena in the decade since his hometown heroes Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg propped him up as Los Angeles' new rap king.

Unlike his appearance with those two mentors in the Super Bowl Halftime Show back in February though Saturday's stage production was far from super elaborate. Black and white imagery and light and dark tones battled each other throughout the concert much like the inner demons that Lamar openly wrestles with on the new record.

The 35-year-old rapper took the stage to the tune of ""United in Grief"" carrying a dummy version of himself as if struggling to offer up his own real voice. He found it soon enough though.

A therapist's voice — recorded by Dame Helen Mirren — popped in here and there over the speakers to offer psychoanalytical feedback to the star after he hid behind a proverbial mask in ""N95"" or wrestled with his fast-rising fame in ""Rich Spirit.""

The rest of the staging matched that stark direct vibe. Instead of fly-girl dancers a dozen men and women in black and white suits gracefully moved in and out of dimmed white stage lighting. And instead of hyperactively running up and down the runway — which stretched more than halfway across the arena floor — Lamar often moved slowly and with purpose. Sometimes he didn't even move at all.

One of the most stirring moments actually found him sitting on a plain chair in the center of the blank stage delivering ""Father Time"" crouched over like a doctor delivering a baby. And what delivery too!

During ""Mirror"" Lamar didn't have any other choice but to mostly stand still. He performed it confined inside a box-shaped hospital decontamination bubble as he lamented about the COVID pandemic ""Sorry I didn't save the world my friend I was too busy building my redemp.""

Another simple but impactful effect played out well in ""M.A.A.D. City"" when the dancers surrounded the rapper with bright flashlights looking like a police caravan closing in on him. Most clever of all in the slow-building ""Count Me Out"" Lamar bobbed and swayed in unison to a giant shadow version of himself reflected on a curtain; the shadow however had arrows shot into his back.

Saturday's set list was stuffed with nearly all the tracks from the new album. The 14000 or so fans responded to the new material with ample excitement and even sang along to some of the deeper cuts. They also turned it on for ""Family Ties"" which brought opener Baby Keem back to the stage.

Based on the rabid reaction to ""King Kunta"" ""Humble"" and ""Backseat Freestyle"" though the crowd would have appreciated more of Lamar's old stuff. You could hear genuine groans when he cut off ""Loyalty"" and ""Swimming Pools (Drank)"" after only one verse each blending them into a medley with ""Bitch Don't Kill My Vibe.""

This one clearly wasn't meant to be a greatest-hits affair though. That made it all the more impressive. It should go down as one of the greatest hip-hop tours of all time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmloZWFydC5jb20vY29udGVudC8yMDIyLTA4LTIwLW1pY2hhZWwtYnVibC13aWZlLWx1aXNhbmEtbG9waWxhdG8td2VsY29tZS1mb3VydGgtYmFieS_SAWdodHRwczovL3d3dy5paGVhcnQuY29tL2FsdGVybmF0ZS9hbXAvMjAyMi0wOC0yMC1taWNoYWVsLWJ1Ymwtd2lmZS1sdWlzYW5hLWxvcGlsYXRvLXdlbGNvbWUtZm91cnRoLWJhYnkv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Michael Bublé & Wife Luisana Lopilato Welcome Fourth Baby,"Michael Buble and wife Luisana Lopilato have welcomed their fourth baby.

A big crowd turned up to the Katanning Leisure Centre on August 19 to see what was understood to be WA’s second dog auction following a similar event 10 years ago at the same venue.

Auction co-ordinator and Williams farmer Jim Harradine said it was hoped the sale would find success and start up an annual event which would raise awareness of the benefits of owning a working dog.

“The revenues raised at regular working dog auctions would help increase the quality of dogs bred in WA” he said.

Mr Carr was thrilled when his three-year-old Kelpie named Tanner topped the sale.

“I’m very excited about the future — this will kickstart my Kelpie stud breeding” he said.

“Tanner was my first Kelpie pup and was sired by my main working dog Ida Vale Cruiser to an outside bitch and I had first pick of the litter.

“She trained up well and worked with me at the Kingston Rest feedlot but she needs a new challenge now.”

Tanner was bought by Kojonup farmer and prominent WA Meat Marketing Co-operative chairman Craig Heggaton who runs four sheep studs.

“A good working dog is worth its weight in gold” he said.

By invitation established South Australian working dog breeder Peter Carr of Barrkel Peters Kelpie stud in Pinaroo brought four dogs to the sale selling to a top of $11700 through AuctionsPlus.

“A working dog can do the work of 10 people” he said.

“I sell between 30 and 40 dogs every year the demand is that good.

“I’ve sold to a top of $21000.”

Mr Harradine said he was very pleased with the sale result with 11 of the 18 dogs on offer selling from $1000-$15900 to average $5093/head.

“We were hoping to sell for reasonable prices to get as many dogs new homes as possible” he said.

“I think people will walk away with an understanding of what a good working dog is worth.”",,,,,,,,,,,,
