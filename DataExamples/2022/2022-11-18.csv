By combining the power of a cloud-based data ecosystem with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) 3M HIS is transforming physician workflows and laborious “back office” processes to help healthcare organizations streamline clinical documentation and billing enhance security and compliance and redesign the physician-patient experience.

The cloud served as the foundation for this transformation. Migrating its 3MTM 360 EncompassTM System clients to Amazon Web Services (AWS) is helping 3M HIS improve the capture management and analysis of patient information across the continuum of care. 3M 360 Encompass is a collection of applications that work together to help hospitals streamline processes receive accurate reimbursement promote compliance and make data-informed decisions. The cloud-based version of the platform has helped 3M HIS and its clients address three primary challenges: a disjointed patient care journey; the byzantine processes that often inhibit timely and accurate billing reimbursement and other record-keeping; and the ongoing need to protect and properly use patient data.

Improving the patient care journey with data and the cloud

The broader objective of 3M HIS’s evolving cloud transformation strategy is to help caregivers improve patient outcomes and staff efficiencies by removing barriers to care and providing access to contextually relevant insights at the time of care according to Detlef Koll Vice President of Product Development with 3M HIS. Caregivers now work with consistent reliable tools within 3M 360 Encompass that improve communication and reduce the types of errors and delays that cause patient anxiety and revenue cycle inefficiencies.

The journey a patient takes through the healthcare system can span years and touch multiple providers from primary care to specialists test labs medical imaging and pharmacies. During each step multiple types of data are captured in the patient’s medical record which serves as an ongoing “narrative” of the patient’s clinical condition and the care delivered. Physician notes from visits and procedures test results and prescriptions are captured and added to the patient’s chart and reviewed by medical coding specialists who work with tens of thousands of codes used by insurance companies to authorize billing and reimbursement.

A complete compliant structured and timely clinical note created in the electronic health record (EHR) empowers many downstream users and is essential for delivering collaborative care and driving appropriate reimbursement. Supporting physicians with cloud-based speech-enabled documentation workflows 3M HIS further creates time to care by delivering proactive patient-specific and in-workflow clinical insights as the note is being created.

The goal of this automated computer-assisted physician documentation (CAPD) technology is to reduce the cognitive overload on physicians regarding coding requirements while closing gaps in patient care and clinical documentation. Without CAPD closing that loop in real time errors or ambiguities in the clinical note lead to what Koll describes as an “asynchronous” process requiring physicians to review and correct the note on a patient seen days earlier thus taking the physician’s time away from patient care and causing delays in the revenue cycle.

To address the issue 3M HIS needed a way to semantically integrate information from multiple data sources based on the needs of various use cases so it deployed AWS data management tools and services including Amazon RDS Amazon Redshift and Amazon Athena for what Koll calls “opportunistic aggregation of information.” For example for billing coding the platform extracts only the relevant billable elements such as an office visit for which a claim will be submitted. This type of flexible cloud-based data management allows 3M HIS to aggregate different data sets for different purposes ensuring both data integrity and faster processing. “This is a dynamic view on data that evolves over time” said Koll.

Improving workflows through intelligent automated processes

The process for gathering data about a patient’s care then extracting the billable elements to submit to an insurance company for reimbursement has long been handled by professional coders who can accurately tag each medical procedure with the correct code out of tens of thousands of possibilities. Errors in that process can lead to rejected claims and additional time required by caregivers to correct any gaps or inconsistencies in clinical documentation which in turn delays cash flows across the complex network of physicians hospitals labs pharmacies suppliers and insurers.

3M HIS’s cloud transformation strategy addressed this challenge by giving clients access to a new suite of data management and AI/ML tools that deliver levels of processing power functionality and scale unthinkable in the former on-premises model.

“If you had to build some of the capabilities yourself you would probably never get there”

said Michael Dolezal Vice President of 3M Digital Science Community. With AWS tools such as Amazon QuickSight and Amazon SageMaker 3M HIS’s clients can “get there” today: “Now our clients not only have a cloud-based instance for their data but they gain access to tools they never had before and get the ability to do things they otherwise wouldn’t” Dolezal said. By bringing 3M 360 Encompass to the AWS Cloud 3M HIS has been able to scale natural language processing and automation capabilities and leverage tools such as Amazon Textract to improve data input and processing to more efficiently organize a patient’s chart.

Automatic speech recognition to capture the clinical narrative at the point of care along with AWS AI/ML services helps 3M HIS aggregate structure and contextualize data to enable the development of task-specific workflow applications. For instance to mitigate the administrative burden on physicians real-time dictation and transcription workflows can be enhanced with automated closed-loop CAPD whereby a physician dictating an admit note can be “nudged” that a certain condition is not fully specified in the note and can fix the gap in real time.

Taking frontline physician-assistive solutions to the next level embedded virtual assistant technology can automate everyday tasks like placing orders for medications and tests. Innovating incrementally toward smarter and more automated workstreams the 3M HIS ambient clinical documentation solution makes documentation in the EHR a byproduct of the natural patient-physician conversation and not a separate onerous task for the doctor. This frees the physician to focus completely on the patient during the visit thereby transforming the experience of healthcare for all stakeholders.

“We want to reduce the inefficient steps in the old model by unifying and information-enabling workflows so that documentation of the procedure and the coding of that procedure are no longer separate work steps” said Koll. “It has the potential to save hours of time per day for a doctor.”

Enhancing the security of patient data

The security and governance of patient data is non-negotiable in healthcare an industry subject to the most stringent data privacy regulations. Administrators are obligated to make sure patient data is consistently used only for its intended purpose is processed only by the application it was collected for and stored and retained according to the specific national regulations involved. The cloud gives 3M HIS more confidence that the data passing through its platform remains secure throughout its journey.

“Using a cloud-based solution means you can apply the same security practices and protocol monitoring across all of your data in a very consistent way” said Dolezal. The platform ensures a shared responsibility for security across 3M HIS its clients and AWS.

Securing patient data in an on-premises health information system puts the onus to protect that information on the client’s infosec team with risks compounded by each client’s unique IT infrastructure and internal data access policies. Security by design is one of the underlying operating principles for AWS. With a single set of code to monitor maintain and patch 3M HIS is able to keep its platform current quickly respond to new threats and vigorously protect patient data centrally with more certainty that its clients are protected as well.

4 best practices for data-driven transformation

Dolezal and Koll advise anyone considering moving large sets of data to the cloud to follow some fundamental precepts in designing a new solution:

Start with the client and work backward to a solution: Be clear on the problem you want to solve and the outcomes you want to deliver to the caregiver and patient and work backward from there to identify the right technology tools and services to help achieve those goals. Don’t over-engineer the solution: Many IT organizations are moving away from traditional point solutions for collecting storing and analyzing patient information. To reduce complexity enhance security and improve flexibility consider an end-to-end solution that is easier to deploy and update than traditional on-premises solutions and lets organizations add new functionality incrementally. Bake in security from the start: In highly regulated industries such as healthcare and financial services security regulations demand high levels of security and personal privacy protection. These capabilities must be built in as foundational components of any system used to collect manage and analyze that data. Don’t constrain native data: Create a data management strategy that accommodates all types of data and isn’t confined to a specific set of use cases today. With both structured and unstructured data flowing into the system the future ability to analyze the past means having data schema that doesn’t need to be re-architected.

In an intense environment with a relentless focus on cost reduction and improved clinical outcomes in conjunction with greater patient and physician well-being 3M HIS helps clients efficiently capture and access patient data gain meaningful insights from all the data and drive high-value action to meet complex goals.

Kansas City-based developer NorthPoint Development has purchased a 310-acre tract on U.S. 221 in Spartanburg and has started work on the Upstate’s newest big-box industrial offering according to a news release from Colliers.

The 3.25-million-square-foot Spartan Enterprise Park is located at 2116 U.S. 221/Chesnee Highway four miles from Spartanburg’s downtown about 20 miles from the Inland Port in Greer GSP International Airport and BMW’s Plant Spartanburg according to the release.

The Colliers team of Garrett Scott Brockton Hall and Dillon Swayngim helped facilitate the land purchase and will handle all leasing for the park the release stated.

The park is master planned to accommodate up to five industrial buildings ranging in size from 287000 square feet up to 1.5 million square feet of contiguous space the release stated. NorthPoint Development has broken ground on 1 million-square-foot Building One and 324633-square-foot Building Two both of which are pre-leasing now and expected to deliver by Q4 2023 according to the release.

Spartan Enterprise Park offers tenants multiple options for spec or build-to-suit industrial space less than one mile from Interstate 85 in one of the nation’s fastest growing corridors for bulk distribution and manufacturing the release stated.

As a nationally recognized developer of industrial space NorthPoint Development plans to include Class A industry leading specifications at Spartan Enterprise including cross-dock orientation heavy power ample parking trailer storage and 40-foot clear heights to meet the needs of modern industrial users.

“NorthPoint Development is excited about the opportunity to bring our expertise to one of the fastest growing industrial markets in the country” NorthPoint Development Director of Industrial Leasing Nathan Brinker said in the release. “We have identified the Upstate as a prime market for investment due to its central location in the Southeast offering access to a large percentage of the population connectivity to major regional transportation corridors and efficient delivery of goods via the state’s expanding inland and seaport network.

“Our assessments of this market show a rapidly growing population and corresponding favorable labor dynamics which companies look to when making expansion or relocation decisions. We look forward to working with local and regional economic development entities as well as the Colliers team to find the right tenants and bring new corporate investment to the Upstate.”

The Greenville-Spartanburg (Upstate) market continues to break industrial construction and absorption records with Colliers market reports projecting approximately 15 million square feet of new industrial inventory delivering in 2022 with 10 million square feet of absorption the release statedc.

“The Upstate continues to draw high demand from manufacturing automotive and distribution/third-party logistics users which Colliers predicts will continue driving absorption of new industrial space in this market for the foreseeable future” said Brockton Hall Colliers vice president and member of the Spartan Enterprise leasing team in the release. “The demand for big-box space is rising across the Southeast and spec developments like Spartan Enterprise aim to capitalize on these size requirements with relatively short timelines for occupancy. This park offers tenants the specifications they need in a market that also checks all the operational and financial boxes.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vbWFya2V0L3N0b2NrLW1hcmtldC1uZXdzL2h1Z2UtZGl2aWRlbmQtb2YtcnMtODUwLXBlci1zaGFyZS1vbi10aGlzLXN0b2NrLWV4LWRhdGUtbmV4dC13ZWVrLTExNjY4NzcwMjI5Mjk0Lmh0bWzSAYsBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGl2ZW1pbnQuY29tL21hcmtldC9zdG9jay1tYXJrZXQtbmV3cy9odWdlLWRpdmlkZW5kLW9mLXJzLTg1MC1wZXItc2hhcmUtb24tdGhpcy1zdG9jay1leC1kYXRlLW5leHQtd2Vlay9hbXAtMTE2Njg3NzAyMjkyOTQuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Huge dividend of ₹850 per share on this stock ex-date next week | Mint,"3M India an Indian Subsidiary of a US-based 3M Company witnessed huge buying on Friday with shares rising by more than ₹500 on Dalal Street.

Article 4 section 7 of the Texas Constitution states “[The Governor] shall have the power to call forth the militia to execute the laws of the State to suppress insurrections and to repel invasions.”

Texas Governor Greg Abbott earlier this week invoked both of these invasion clauses in response to the federal government’s lack of action to secure the US-Mexico Border. Abbott has declared he will use this federal and state constitutional authority as Governor to secure the Texas border until the federal government will start doing something about the border crisis.

Abbott is saying if the federal government will not deal with the border crisis Texas will take over with authority granted in the Consitution to defend itself with everything in its power to do so.

Furthermore the federal government can no longer use Title 42 a law summoned during the pandemic that allowed the border patrol to quickly expel migrants. However this past week a federal judge blocked the Biden Administration from utilizing it any longer.

Earlier this week Governor Abbott sent three letters criticizing the federal government’s lack of action and reiterating the initiatives he will be increasing to secure the border. One letter was sent to county judges in border counties; the second to DPS and the Texas Military Department; and the third to President Joe Biden.

In the letter to county judges in border counties Abbott stated the US Congress should reimburse Texas for the 4 billion it has spent on the border something Abbott declares is the federal government’s job; federal officials violating immigration laws should be tried and possibly impeached and Congress should change certain federal laws so that those troops deployed at the border are not “exposed to federal criminal prosecution for protecting Texas against illegal entry between the ports of entry” said Abbott.

In the letter addressed to President Biden Governor Abbott accused Biden of violating Article 4 section 4 of the US Consitution that declares the federal government will protect the states from invasion. Governor Abbott also listed that Biden is failing to enforce federal laws that criminalize illegal crossings and violating federal rules on how the US should admit migrants.

In the letter to DPS Director Steve McGraw and Texas Military Department Adjutant General Thomas Suelzer Abbott ordered both of them to “use all resources and tools available to repel immigrants from attempting to cross illegally arrest those who cross illegally and return them to the border and arrest criminals who violate Texas law.”

For the past year Abbott has conducted a robust border security program Operation Lonestar which has amassed over 4 billion in state funding. Millions of immigrants have been apprehended hundreds of millions of lethal doses of fentanyl have been uncovered and Governor Abbott has gone as far as to label Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations. Furthermore Governor Abbott seeks efforts for Texas to build its border wall.

Abbott has also been utilizing the status of sanctuary cities across the US and busing migrants to relieve Texas border communities. Philadelphia has been added to the list of cities to send migrants along with Washington D.C. New York City and Chicago.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vY29sbGlkZXIuY29tL2FiYm90LWVsZW1lbnRhcnktamFjb2ItbXItYy1jb3JueS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Abbott Elementary Teaches You How to Embrace Your Corny Side,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vY29sbGlkZXIuY29tL2FiYm90LWVsZW1lbnRhcnktamFjb2ItbXItYy1jb3JueS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXRlc21hbi5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9lZHVjYXRpb24vMjAyMi8xMS8xOC9nb3YtZ3JlZy1hYmJvdHQtYmFuLWNvdmlkLTE5LXZhY2NpbmUtc2Nob29sLXJlcXVpcmVtZW50cy82OTY1NzE1NTAwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gov. Greg Abbott drills down on COVID-19 school vaccine requirement ban,"Gov. Greg Abbott told state and local education officials Thursday that Texas school districts couldn't mandate a COVID-19 vaccine for students as one of the various shots required for public school entry.

Abbott's directive comes weeks after a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention committee recommended the COVID-19 shot be added to the list of required vaccines for students which in Texas would be just one of about a dozen required immunizations.

In two separate letters sent to Texas Education Agency Commissioner Mike Morath and to superintendents across the state Abbott said existing state law overrides the CDC's vaccine recommendation. On Aug. 5 2021 Abbott issued an executive order prohibiting governmental entities from issuing vaccine mandates.

""Despite attempts at federal overreach into the health care decisions of Americans in Texas we continue to honor and defend the freedom of parents to choose what is best for the health and well-being of their families"" Abbott said in the letters.

Abbott's order means parents can opt their child out of a COVID-19 vaccine according to his letter.

Abbott has continued to renew the state pandemic disaster declaration he issued in March 2020 — a measure that keeps in place the 40 executive orders and suspensions of Texas law he issued to address the coronavirus pandemic.

The CDC hasn't adopted its committee's recommendation to include COVID-19 shots in its list of preferred vaccines for school children. If the CDC did recommend the vaccine states still wouldn't have to adopt the guidance.

When the CDC committee announced its recommendation in October state officials including Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton rejected the proposal.

Paxton signed his name on a letter to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services denouncing the CDC committee's recommendation. Florida Attorney General Jeff Landry authored the letter.

What Austin-area school districts say

Austin-area districts who responded to requests for comment Thursday said they don't foresee the order having much effect on their operations.

""We have always planned to proceed with Covid vaccination as a parent/student choice"" the Austin district told the American-Statesman. ""Unless the Texas Department of State Health Services adds the vaccine to the required list we will continue to support vaccination efforts as a parent choice.""

The Eanes and Elgin districts haven't required COVID-19 vaccines for students and don't plan on doing so spokespeople said.

The Hays district follows vaccine requirements set by the state and it doesn't have the authority to set its own policy on vaccine requirements spokesman Tim Savoy said.

The Texas Department of State Health Services in conjunction with the Texas Education Agency sets vaccine requirements for students. The health services department last month said it didn't have any plans to add the COVID-19 vaccine to its list of required inoculations.

Children entering kindergarten must be vaccinated against various diseases such as polio measles mumps rubella diphtheria tetanus pertussis Hepatitis A and B and chickenpox according to the Department of State Health Services.

Students entering seventh grade also must have a meningococcal vaccine.

Parents can exempt their children from vaccinations if a physician provides a statement with a medical reason or for ""reasons of conscience including a religious belief"" according to the department.

Since the launch of Operation Lone Star the multi-agency effort has led to over 325000 migrant apprehensions and more than 21900 criminal arrests with more than 19400 felony charges reported. In the fight against fentanyl DPS has seized over 352 million lethal doses of fentanyl during this border mission.

Texas has also bused almost 8400 migrants to our nation's capital since April over 3800 migrants to New York City since August 5 and more than 1200 migrants to Chicago since August 31. This week the first bus of migrants departed for Philadelphia from Texas (story below). The busing mission is providing much-needed relief to our overwhelmed border communities.

Operation Lone Star continues to fill the dangerous gaps left by the Biden Administration's refusal to secure the border. Every individual who is apprehended or arrested and every ounce of drugs seized would have otherwise made their way into communities across Texas and the nation due to President Biden's open border policies.

RECENT HIGHLIGHTS FROM OPERATION LONE STAR:

Governor Abbott To President Biden: Texas Is Escalating Border Security Efforts

Governor Abbott this week sent a letter to President Joe Biden highlighting the record-breaking level of illegal immigration at America’s southern border caused by the President’s sustained dereliction of duty enforcing the nation’s immigration laws. The Governor notes that the federal government’s failure to execute America’s immigration laws has forced the State of Texas to protect its own territory.

“Two years of inaction on your part now leave Texas with no choice but to escalate our efforts to secure our State"" reads the letter. ""Your open-border policies which have catalyzed an unprecedented crisis of illegal immigration are the sole cause of Texas having to invoke our constitutional authority to defend ourselves.""

The Governor’s letter outlines America’s current immigration laws the President must enforce to satisfy the federal government's constitutional obligation to safeguard its citizens including:

Aggressively prosecuting illegal entry and illegal reentry.

Complying with laws mandating that various categories of aliens “shall” be detained.

Stopping parole for aliens en masse in violation of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996.

Fully reinstating the Migrant Protection Protocols such that aliens seeking admission remain in Mexico while proceedings unfold in the United States.

Immediately resuming construction of the border wall in Texas using the billions of dollars Congress has appropriated for that purpose.

Governor Abbott Orders DPS TMD To Use All Strategies To Stop Border Crisis

Governor Greg Abbott on Wednesday ordered DPS and the Texas Military Department (TMD) to expand their unprecedented efforts to combat the growing illegal immigration along the Texas-Mexico border. In a letter to DPS Director Steve McCraw and TMD Adjutant General Thomas Suelzer the Governor outlined the need for the Operation Lone Star partners to defend Texas against what amounts to an invasion of America's southern border.

“Until Congress acts or the Biden Administration does its constitutionally required job Texas guardsmen and troopers must bear the burden of securing the border” reads the letter. “I order you to use all resources and tools available to repel immigrants from attempting to cross illegally arrest those who cross illegally and return them to the border and arrest criminals who violate Texas law.”

Read Governor Abbott’s letter to Director McCraw and Maj. Gen. Suelzer.

Governor Abbott Invokes Invasion Clause To Defend Texans Amid Border Crisis

On Monday the Governor sent a letter to county judges in Texas explaining his Executive Order that invokes the Invasion Clauses of the U.S. and Texas Constitutions to fully authorize the unprecedented actions Texas is taking to secure the border amid an all-time record for illegal immigration including devoting more than $4 billion toward border security and enhanced public safety measures.

As Governor of Texas and commander-in-chief of its military forces Governor Abbott has used constitutional authority other authorization and Executive Orders for historic actions such as building a border wall in multiple counties along the border designating Mexican drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations and repelling immigrants seeking to enter illegally.

Governor Abbott Announces First Bus Of Migrants Departs For Philadelphia

On Tuesday Governor Abbott announced the departure of the first group of migrants bused to Philadelphia Pennsylvania from Texas. Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney has long-celebrated and fought for sanctuary city status making the city an ideal addition to Texas' list of drop-off locations.

""Since April Texas' busing strategy has successfully provided much-needed relief to our border communities overwhelmed by the historic influx of migrants caused by President Biden's reckless open border policies"" said Governor Abbott.

WATCH: DPS Lt. Olivarez Describes Stark Reality Of Ongoing Border Crisis

Following the resignation of Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Chris Magnus this week DPS Lt. Chris Olivarez told Fox News that the ongoing border crisis will only be resolved if the Biden Administration reinstates the effective border policies President Trump enacted. Lt. Olivarez also described the staggering amount of smuggled fentanyl DPS troopers have seized in Texas.

“Unfortunately unless there’s a significant change we’re going to continue seeing this over the next two years” said Lt. Olivarez. “We’re going to continue seeing mass migration we’re going to continue seeing fentanyl pouring across the border we’re going to continue seeing human smuggling events and of course some of the illegal immigrants coming across will lose their lives. Not to mention the known gotaways and suspected terrorists coming across the border.”

Texas National Guard Assists With Apprehension Of Over 200 Illegal Immigrants

Texas National Guard soldiers assisted with the apprehension of more than 200 illegal immigrants in an incident earlier this month in Eagle Pass after a steady stream of illegal river crossings was reported.

“It is important to give out clear instructions when handling big groups like these before it turns into chaos” said Staff Sgt. Ernesto Delgado. “A lot of the folks crossing become extremely disoriented and are not sure what is going on or what their next steps are.”

WATCH: DPS Led On High-Speed Chase 14 Illegal Immigrants Apprehended

A human smuggler from California led DPS troopers on a high-speed vehicle pursuit in Val Verde County. The driver rammed through a ranch gate and drove onto a dirt road before eventually stopping and running into the brush along with 14 illegal immigrants.

The driver was arrested and charged with human smuggling. The 14 illegal immigrants from Mexico were apprehended and referred to Border Patrol.

DPS Finds 19 Illegal Immigrants Hiding In Vehicles Stash House In Laredo

As part of Operation Lone Star DPS troopers stopped three vehicles concealing 19 illegal immigrants and located a stash house in Webb County. After noticing suspicious activity involving several vehicles in a parking lot in Laredo DPS located a total of 15 illegal immigrants in three separate vehicles in three different locations. An additional four illegal immigrants were then located inside a suspected stash house.

The 19 illegal immigrants from Mexico El Salvador and Guatemala were referred to Border Patrol. Two individuals were also arrested and charged with human smuggling.

WATCH: Mission Police Officer Describes Impact Of Operation Lone Star Presence

The ongoing border crisis had brought on a wave of crime in Mission before the Texas National Guard and DPS came to the assistance of overwhelmed local law enforcement.

“We really appreciate them being here; it’s a big plus for our community the state and our nation” said Arturo Flores Mission Police Department. “It shows presence and that we’re working in unity. It deters a lot of crime.”

Texas National Guard DPS Practice Show-Of-Force Mass-Migration Response

Texas National Guard soldiers and DPS troopers held fortified positions along the Rio Grande River during a recent show-of-force mass-migration response exercise.

“The joint tactical environment helps train our troops in the event we need to respond to a mass-migration event with overwhelming force"" said Capt. Nerissa Rodriguez of the Texas Air National Guard and Director of Operations for Task Force South."

Global Adalimumab Infliximab and Etanercept Biosimilars Market

Global Adalimumab Infliximab and Etanercept Biosimilars Market

Dublin Nov. 18 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Adalimumab Infliximab and Etanercept Biosimilars Global Market Report 2022: By Product By Application By Distribution"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The global adalimumab infliximab and etanercept biosimilars market is expected to grow from $3.10 billion in 2021 to $4.76 billion in 2022 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 53.4%. The market is expected to reach $18.61 billion in 2026 at a CAGR of 40.6%.



The main types of products in adalimumab infliximab and etanercept biosimilars are adalimumab biosimilars (exemptia mabura hyrimoz hadlima abrilada others) infliximab biosimilars (inflectra renflexis ixifi avsola) and cipleumab (erelzi eticovo). Adalimumab is a biological drug that works on the immune system to lessen inflammation. The different applications include crohn's disease psoriatic arthritis rheumatoid arthritis ulcerative colitis ankylosing spondylitis plaque psoriasis others and is distributed through various channels such as hospital pharmacies retail pharmacies online pharmacies.



The patent expiry of branded drugs allows biosimilars to enter the market. For instance In United States FDA approved inflectra developed by Hospira (a Pfizer Inc company) for the treatment of various autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis adult ulcerative colitis plaque psoriasis after the patent expiry of branded drug Remicade.

Similarly Amgen's Enbrel had its patent expired in the EU and with the expiry of the patent Benepali (a biosimilar of Enmbrel) was approved by the European Commission. Humira's patent expired and its biosimilars were made available in the market. FDA has recently (July 2020) approved Hulio the sixth biosimilar of Humira. Therefore the patent expiry of branded biologic drugs such as Humira Enbrel and Remicade will drive the biosimilar market.



The patent extension of Humira (adalimumab) will hamper the Humira biosimilar market. The patent extension is a strategy to compete with generic and biosimilar products after patent termination. For instance the patents of Humira the branded biologic drug manufactured by AbbVie in the US and EU.

AbbVie obtained Supplementary Protection Certificates (SPCs) that provided protection in Europe. AbbVie received a patent extension for Humira till 2023 in the US. In pursuit of patent extension AbbVie also had settlements with Amgen Samsung Bioepis and Mylan to protect Humira sales in the United States. The patent extension of Humira is anticipated to hinder its biosimilars market growth.



The brand versions of biosimilar drugs are of high costs which are now being replaced with biosimilar versions upon their patent's expiry. The cost of branded biologic drugs almost doubled in recent years. For instance the cost of Humira the top-selling drug increased to more than $72000 in 2020.

Story continues

The shift to low-cost biosimilar drugs is mainly because there are no clinically relevant differences in safety and efficacy between the biosimilars and originator biologics. The Danish health care system switched almost entirely to adalimumab biosimilars after the patent on the original adalimumab product Humira expired in October 2018. The switch to biosimilars led to an 82% decrease in costs for the medication.

With the upcoming cessation of third-party cookies marketers and business leaders across all industries are being forced to navigate a new challenge: to continue building and improving their relationships with customers they now need a new way to gather data. According to Epsilon research about 80% of marketers still rely on third-party cookies with 38% feeling frustrated and overwhelmed by the news.

High consumer expectations are becoming larger issues for brands wanting to encourage more purchases and increase customer loyalty. Consumers will only place an order if they feel complete confidence in what they are buying by getting the value they expect. This expectation is prompting brands to shift their relationship with consumers to one that is reciprocal and beneficial to both sides.

Brands today are realizing the importance of relationship-driven commerce and are deploying personalized programs to create a ‘give and get’ scenario with their customers that allows them to gather zero- and first-party data. This is instrumental in deepening the customer and brand relationship which is positive for the brand and also provides better service for customers.

This shift to relationship-driven commerce helps brands drive purchases and build loyalty. A Boston Consulting Group survey says that consumers today are “110% more likely to add additional items to their baskets and 40% more likely to spend more than they had planned” when their shopping experience is hyper-personalized. And we at Revieve have seen that this correlates directly to loyalty growth and repeat purchases.

Delivering personalization at scale is imperative. Customers interact with brands in a myriad of ways and expect an individualized approach across every brand touchpoint. Let’s take a moment to dig a little deeper into the different ways that personalization advances business success.

Strengthening the brand-customer relationship

Personalization allows consumers to develop their preferences and make informed purchase decisions. It ensures the consumer feels recognized as an individual rather than being clustered into a group by generation age group or gender. It provides individual recognition. Consumers are learning that brands can anticipate their needs if they provide those businesses with data. By sharing their data consumers allow brands to create these bespoke experiences for them to enjoy. And consumers can feel more confident that their data is used appropriately to their benefit since they provided it willingly to the brand for a better experience in return.

In digital environments that lack a human touch the best way for brands to personalize the customer journey is through the collection and analysis of data to inform their recommendations to customers. The more data collected the better for the customer. This is where the symbiotic relationship emerges.

By gathering zero-party data brands are empowered to deliver continuously improved personalization. For example in a category as personal as beauty brands can gather and analyze data from variables like skin types hair color beauty preferences etc to provide consumers with specific advice and information tailored to and relevant to them. Because customers are providing their information of their own accord they are training the brands to provide even better recommendations and advice on addressing their concerns.

This data trade creates a seamless interdependent relationship: customers provide their information freely to inform the brands on how to provide better experiences for them and brands now have additional information from their customers to continuously provide better recommendations and advice. As both sides continue this exchange the customer experience improves and the relationship between both sides is strengthened. This builds loyalty and trust and ultimately is a win-win scenario.

Personalization as a driver for brand differentiation

Personalization can also be a key avenue for developing brand differentiation. According to a data report from McKinsey 71% of consumers today expect brands to deliver personalized experiences and 76% become displeased when this doesn’t happen. Brands can use personalization as a competitive advantage to set themselves apart from the rest of the pack.

When a brand makes the customer experience convenient and delightful the chances of a customer returning are higher. Personalization programs that collect first- and zero-party data help improve those odds. And what should underlie an engaging customer experience is a brand strategy that emphasizes building symbiotic relationships with consumers. This type of relationship can set brands apart because it’s based on responding to customer needs fulfilling their expectations and making them feel valued. It takes the brand-customer relationship to the next level. But unfortunately creating this type of relationship isn’t as easy as it sounds and few brands are doing it right.

In beauty retail many brands have set a new baseline for their customer experience one that blends online and offline experiences to provide customers with a seamless and tailored customer journey through every channel. However this requires the use of digital tools to enable a consistent digital and in-store experience to deploy AI-powered product recommendations or quizzes to uncover precisely what the customer wants and needs. The brands that can offer this level of customization for each individual customer can secure their place as leaders in the space by setting themselves apart through a truly customer-centric approach.

Exceeding customer expectations

Customers are complex individuals with rich varied stories. Figuring out how to start a dialogue with them is a step toward providing customers with what they want from a brand. According to a recent study by Accenture 83% of consumers are willing to share their information so that brands will create a personalized experience for them. But businesses must be transparent about how they will use this data and that customers have control over it. In addition 91% of consumers are more likely to shop with brands that “recognize remember and provide” relevant offers and recommendations. Consumers need to get something in return for sharing their data with a brand – otherwise why would they do it? There needs to be something in it for them.

A brand that remembers consumers when they return to their site and recognizes their preferences makes customers feel special. In fact I truly believe that personalization is about respect. It’s proper manners to recognize that people are different and unique when you interact with them. Just as you don’t treat each in-store customer in exactly the same way brands shouldn’t treat online customers like clones. Making consumers feel like true individuals will increase their propensity to become repeat buyers.

Henry Ford famously stated “If I had asked people what they wanted they would have said faster horses.“ Customers are quick to describe their problems but aren’t always as adept at finding solutions. Customers might recognize something is missing from their shopping experience but not actually know what it is. That’s where brands can step in and really shine. This is the moment where brands can exceed customers’ expectations and provide them with what they need and what they didn’t even know they needed yet. And personalization is what can drive brands to take that proactive approach. This can impress even the most discerning customer.

What’s next?

Personalization is often a factor that brands don’t fully address. And yet it can be the magic to better understand their customers and give them exactly what they have been wanting even if they haven’t thought to ask for it. Data plays a critical role but the exchange must go both ways so both sides benefit. As long as brands can instill confidence in consumers to volunteer their personal information to get something in return then brands can forge a symbiotic relationship that has greater benefits in the long run. And that approach is what can truly create the best scenario for both customers and brands alike.

As a result the ASX is going back to the drawing board and scrapping its original intentions to use distributed ledger technology at its core.

""The independent report coupled with our own assessment work confirms a number of significant challenges associated with aspects of the CHESS replacement project"" ASX managing director and CEO Helen Lofthouse said. ""These findings provide valuable inputs to helping us determine a revised solution. We have some work to do before updating and consulting with stakeholders more deeply.""

Lofthouse further clarified the $245-to-$255 million derecognition charge reflected the uncertainty of the future value of the current solution design.

""Our clearing and settlement licenses are critical. We take feedback seriously and examine it carefully” she said. “We are aiming for the best solution for the Australian market and will be wide-ranging and thoughtful in our analysis of the options.""

As a result the ASX has hired Tim Whiteley as project director for the next phase of the CHESS replacement reporting to Lofthouse. It will also establish an industry forum to provide input and receive regular status reporting on the project complementing the existing business committee.

As the next step the ASX will undertake further planning to understand and evaluate solution design options and potential impact. All stakeholder activity on the project will be paused and the industry testing environment closed.

In 2017 following two years of evaluation the ASX confirmed it was spending $50 million in replacing its decades-old Clearing House Electronic Subregister System (CHESS) with blockchain-inspired distributed ledger technology (DLT) developed by US software firm Digital Asset.

CHESS has been used to record shareholdings and manage the clearing and settlement of equity transactions in Australia since it was introduced in 1994.

The exchange wanted to take the opportunity to replace it with ""a next-generation post-trade platform using contemporary technology"".

The appointment of Accenture in September came as the ASX pushed back the CHESS go-live date ""based on current information"".

Delivery model execution and what went wrong

Accenture’s review of the system shone a spotlight on the lack of communication between both ASX and Digital Asset (DA) matched with lacking accountability.

The report pointed out deficiencies in execution rigour and the lack of a clear understanding of progress compounded by misalignment and expectations between ASX and DA.

The siloed execution and reporting between them resulted in misaligned views of status including delivery progress risks and issues.

This was further hampered by insufficiently detailed alignment of scope delivery plan and resourcing resulting in missed dependencies and opportunities for optimisation.

Test and internal release management processes also lacked industrialised tooling along with management of vendor accountabilities including inconsistent information tracking execution outcomes and quality-related metrics the report said.

Functional and nonfunctional requirements were also misaligned and sometimes conflicting along with granularity/quality delivery timing and scope which the core issues highlighted the consequences of this.

The Accenture report was broken up into three stages focusing on the six core issues identified by ASX and DA; the delivery assessment featuring a solution review looking at the architecture and use of Daml and VMware Blockchain and a set of 45 recommendations that were grouped into 12 areas of focus on ways of working software delivery quality engineering efficiency and solution design.

The six core issues identified by ASX and DA were holdings batch settlement bulk process support and resiliency bilateral matching issuer notifications and support for ex-transactions.

During the build and testing phase of the new technology the report found that the overarching strategy and approach deviated from effective testing strategy definition and documentation leading to significant retesting and longer feedback cycles.

Despite the ASX's wishes to implement a DTL system the DA development and system test were not executed on a ledger-based environment making it difficult for the ASX team to validate it leading to delivering non-functional capabilities.

Quality management was also inconsistently observed throughout workshops and program artefact reviews and the change management team was unstaffed due to recent departures."

The $20 billion cash and stock acquisition was announced in September and sent some corners of the creative industry into meltdown over concerns Adobe will merge the new plaything with its XD software and up the price list.

According to some reports the DoJ has spent time contacting customers competitors and Figma's venture capital backers to collate views on the sale with a possible antitrust investigation in the offing.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this week Adobe said it and Figma filed a notification and report form in relation to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements (HSR) Act with the DoJ and Federal Trade Commission on October 14. This is paperwork that must be filed and approved before mergers acquisitions or transfers of security and assets can be completed.

""On November 14 2022 the parties each received a Request for Additional Information and Documentary Material (a 'second request') from the DoJ with respect to the transaction"" Adobe disclosed in the SEC filing.

As such the sale is not allowed to be completed until 30 days after Adobe and Figma have responded with additional data or answers to questions. The filing states: ""The HSR waiting period will expire 30 days after Adobe and Figma each certify their substantial compliance with the second request unless earlier terminated by the DOJ or extended by agreement of the parties or court order.""

If the DoJ and FTC aren't satisfied with the responses they could take action under antitrust laws including seeking divestitures of substantial assets of the two companies asking them to license assets or terminate the agreement.

Regulatory authorities in other regions may also decide to take a keener look at the $20 billion sale which would be among the largest takeovers of a private software developer on record.

Figma is a browser-based app built to manage file organization by showing projects and their files in a dedicated format. There's no installation no patching and no updates. It is a vector-based graphic editor and prototyping tool. The company launched in 2016 and has received $332.9 million funding to date.

It has an estimated 4 million users some of which are drawn by its freemium pricing and relatively lightweight interface. In contrast Adobe has more than 9900 companies using XD its rival software.

There are fears among some users that Adobe will combine the two and raise subscription costs something that Figma co-founder Dylan Field said isn't happening and that the platform will remain free for education users.

Should the deal not go ahead Adobe will potentially have to pay Figma a $1 billion termination fee under certain conditions. ®",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVzb2Z0d2FyZXJlcG9ydC5jb20vYWZ0ZXItZmlnbWEtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24tYWRvYmVzLWRpZ2l0YWwtbWVkaWEtcHJlc2lkZW50LWRhdmlkLXdhZGh3YW5pLWFwcGVhcnMtcG9pc2VkLXRvLXN1Y2NlZWQtY2VvLXNoYW50YW51LW5hcmF5ZW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After Figma Acquisition Adobe’s Digital Media President David Wadhwani Appears Poised to Succeed CEO Shantanu ...,"During any period of economic downturn businesses typically tighten their budgets but for Adobe high inflation and uncertainty provide an opportunity to take a big risk that could yield great results. Chief Executive Officer Shantanu Narayen led prior such gambles like the company’s 2009 acquisition of Omniture. However it was David Wadhwani president of the digital media business vertical who led this year’s purchase of Figma — a close rival in the web application design market. With the $20 billion gambit Wadhwani seems poised to rise in the company’s leadership ranks.

Wadhwani a veteran of Adobe with a decade of experience in two stints is widely seen as Narayen’s likely successor — although the CEO has not indicated a departure any time soon. However the digital media president is already the third-highest-paid executive (behind Narayen and CFO Dan Durn).

Figma had cut into Adobe’s web interface design business winning over developers at Microsoft Google Oracle and others so Wadhwani’s gamble was met with some scrutiny. But if the acquisition proves fruitful and regulators don’t intervene it could be seen as a genius move that might set the company’s future course for a long time to come.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlZHNoYXJrbmV3cy5jb20vcGFudG9uZS12cy1hZG9iZS1hbmQtdGhlLXRyb3VibGUtd2l0aC1zdWJzY3JpcHRpb24tc29mdHdhcmXSAWRodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZWRzaGFya25ld3MuY29tL3BhbnRvbmUtdnMtYWRvYmUtYW5kLXRoZS10cm91YmxlLXdpdGgtc3Vic2NyaXB0aW9uLXNvZnR3YXJlP2hzX2FtcD10cnVl?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pantone vs Adobe and the trouble with subscription software,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlZHNoYXJrbmV3cy5jb20vcGFudG9uZS12cy1hZG9iZS1hbmQtdGhlLXRyb3VibGUtd2l0aC1zdWJzY3JpcHRpb24tc29mdHdhcmXSAWRodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZWRzaGFya25ld3MuY29tL3BhbnRvbmUtdnMtYWRvYmUtYW5kLXRoZS10cm91YmxlLXdpdGgtc3Vic2NyaXB0aW9uLXNvZnR3YXJlP2hzX2FtcD10cnVl?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E60FDF09D0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlZHNoYXJrbmV3cy5jb20vcGFudG9uZS12cy1hZG9iZS1hbmQtdGhlLXRyb3VibGUtd2l0aC1zdWJzY3JpcHRpb24tc29mdHdhcmXSAWRodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZWRzaGFya25ld3MuY29tL3BhbnRvbmUtdnMtYWRvYmUtYW5kLXRoZS10cm91YmxlLXdpdGgtc3Vic2NyaXB0aW9uLXNvZnR3YXJlP2hzX2FtcD10cnVl?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXBob2Jsb2dyYXBoZXIuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvMTkvd2h5LWlzbnQtYWktYWlkZWQtZHVzdC1zcG90LXJlbW92YWwtaW4tbW9yZS1zb2Z0d2FyZS1ieS1ub3cv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Isn't AI Aided Dust Spot Removal in More Software by Now,"Spread the love

Today’s leading editing software can remove almost anything you want from your photographs. Found an old photo of yours but saw your nagging ex in the frame? You can now quickly remove a person with a single click in Adobe’s Photoshop and Lightroom software. Want to erase an airplane or bird from the sky? A quick swipe can do this even in editing software on your smartphone. Skin retouching to make your face smoother sky replacement to swap out your hazy skies with picturesque clouds even changing a frown to a smile: all this is available in Adobe’s Photoshop software and is managed by their AI-enabled Sensei technology. But we’re still missing out on automating one of the most time consuming parts of editing: sensor and dust spot removal.

Things Get Spotty Too Often

“Always think of the bigger picture” was often repeated by my boss when I worked in IT. I was a programmer who wanted to go live with his code as quickly as possible so this wasn’t a mantra I used to adhere to. But my boss would often tell me to think deeper about the potential implications of my code for the overall organization. Maybe that’s what the folks at Adobe and Capture One have been focusing on regarding their editing software. The bigger picture. Literally.

Content Aware Fill is one of the most amazing tools that Adobe has recently brought to Photoshop. When used along with Subject selection you can remove a stray object or an unwanted person from your photo in just a few seconds. And most people won’t be able to tell that an edit of such magnitude was done in the first place. What would take minutes and even hours in previous years can now be accomplished in no time.

But to serious photographers especially those who deal with large-sized prints advertising hoardings and roadside billboards one of the biggest niggles to deal with is sensor spots. Sometimes a few end up being visible enough to necessitate removing them. But often especially for landscape photographers using narrow apertures you see more than a handful. And having to manually sit and carefully clone out each and every one of these is a royal pain. Too much of my time is spent having to clone out dust spots and it’s mainly when working on images where I’ve used f16 or narrower apertures.

I Do Have An Air Blower Thank You

A number of you may say that I should clean my sensor before I shoot. I’d like to state that I live in a city that’s technically a metropolis surrounded by a desert. Dust is something I contend with each day I step out for a shoot. I make it a point to blow the dust off my sensor before I head out. Even then inevitably dust does creep into the camera even if I’m not changing lenses outdoors. I don’t have the luxury of doing a wet sensor cleaning before every shoot. So very often for me there’s really no option but to shoot despite the sensor dust.

No client likes an image peppered with spots. As talented as a retoucher can be there’s no denying that each spot needs to be manually cloned out before delivering final images. If you use Capture One this can be more painstaking to do than if you use Adobe Lightroom. The color handling and overall output of photos are fantastic with Capture One but the software still falls short in some aspects.

One Aspect Where Lightroom Trumps Over Capture One

An area where Lightroom really does better than Capture One is with the “Visualise Spots” option in the Healing Tool. Lightroom makes it easy to see dust spots in your photograph that aren’t readily visible to the naked eye.

The slider isn’t even halfway through and we can already see that Lightroom has spotted (pun intended) some dust spots that weren’t immediately visible. But see what happens when we move the slider even further to the right.

I wouldn’t have seen most of these dust spots if I had my face all the way up to my screen at 100%. Adobe Lightroom does a great job in tackling dust spot removal.

This image shows the number of spots I saw when using Capture One 23. The software still doesn’t have a spot visualization tool at the time of writing this article. I need to view the image at 100% scroll from edge to edge and locate them myself. In total there are 26 points I pinned for dust spot removal. I then decided to run the same photo via Adobe Lightroom to see what it could pick.

There are definitely more than 26 in here; Lightroom is clearly outdoing Capture One in the dust spot locating aspect of things.

Why Can’t You Remove The Spots For Me?

Why can’t I also isolate the sky as an area for dust spot removal?

Do we really need more skies replaced in our photos? Can’t we also have a good tool for dust spot removal? Even when photographing good skies there are bound to be spots on our sensors. If software like Adobe Lightroom can detect dust spots why can’t they replace them for us? If I use the Spot Healing Tool over one of the visible spots shown to me Lightroom uses an algorithm to heal/clone over that spot. Now if it could detect these spots what’s stopping it from going ahead and removing them for me? You might argue that it could mess up the image if it did this for the entire photo.

I suggest providing a selectable area or subject option to activate the AI dust spot removal process. That way I could choose the areas of the image where I want the dust removed. It could leave out the genuine spots from being cloned/healed by the AI. I spent nearly an hour cloning out spots from a handful of images that needed to be sent to a client. That’s a lot of time when you consider that it was just a few images but hundreds of spots in total.

Skylum Luminar Is Ahead Of The Main Players

Skylum’s Luminar Neo had AI dust spot removal at the time of its release last year. In fact a lot of their software edits are AI supported. If a relatively new player to the game can provide this what’s stopping Capture One and Adobe from bringing this to their palette already? Adobe has been bragging about its Sensei tool’s capabilities for a few years. It’s about time that dust spot removal becomes an AI-automated tool to make our lives easier. Please let us edit quicker by allowing AI to take charge of this painstaking task.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyZWF0aXZlYmxvcS5jb20vbmV3cy95b3V0dWJlLWlsbHVzdHJhdG9yLXRpcHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These awesome Adobe Illustrator hacks could save you tons of time,"Adobe Illustrator remains the industry standard vector graphics editor for a reason.

You have to get two things right to successfully invest in stocks. First you must have a decent idea of a company's long-term growth potential and the associated odds. Second you must pay a price that is reasonable based on those odds.

Over the past couple of years many investors forgot that second part. It didn't matter until it did. With rising interest rates and recession fears putting a chill on valuations the priciest growth stocks have been decimated in the true sense of the word.

A value stock is not simply a cheap stock it's a stock with a valuation that doesn't fully reflect the underlying company's growth potential. Walt Disney (DIS 0.34%) and Intel (INTC 0.30%) are two prime examples.

1. A media and entertainment juggernaut

It's tough to value Disney right now because the company is going through a transition that's knocking down profits. The media giant is pouring billions into its streaming businesses and if you look at subscriber counts that strategy is working like a charm. But the cost of that success is steep.

Disney now has over 210 million streaming subscribers spread across its various services. Disney+ which launched just three years ago has attracted 164.2 million paying customers. The company's unmatched portfolio of intellectual property which includes Marvel and Star Wars gives it an endless source of ideas for streaming content.

Disney has used rock-bottom prices to juice its subscriber gains. Excluding Disney+ Hotstar the average customer pays just $5.96 per month for the service. Disney will likely use the same strategy it uses for its parks: raise prices over time to reflect the value and unique nature of what it can offer its customers. Right now the streaming business is losing around $4 billion annually. Disney has pricing power and it can flex it to turn streaming into a wildly profitable business in the long run.

Disney's stock doesn't look particularly cheap on the surface. The company generated adjusted EPS of $3.53 in fiscal 2022 putting the price-to-earnings ratio at around 26. But it's not Disney's current results that are important; it's the company's long-term potential. The optionality Disney's IP portfolio provides should not be underestimated. Disney's performance is messy right now but this is an iconic company that should grow stronger over time.

2. A chip giant with a plan

Intel is one of the last remaining semiconductor companies that both designs and manufacturers logic chips. The company is investing heavily to build out its own foundry business aiming to take a big chunk of the global foundry market by selling its manufacturing capacity and expertise.

That's part of Intel's comeback plan. The other part is to retake the performance and efficiency crowns from rival AMD in its core PC and server CPU markets. Intel has already succeeded in PCs -- the company's Raptor Lake chips beat the competition in nearly every measure. It's going to take a while in the server market -- while Intel suffered delay after delay with its Sapphire Rapids chips AMD was stealing market share and putting out superior products.

Intel's market share losses and the heavy spending necessary to build its foundry business have weighed on the stock. Like Disney simply looking at the P/E ratio as it stands today isn't all that meaningful. The company expects to produce adjusted earnings per share of $1.95 this year putting the P/E ratio at roughly 15.

Earnings will be depressed as Intel invests heavily in manufacturing and executes on its roadmap to take back the server market share that it's lost. A weak PC market isn't helping although billions in cost cuts over the next three years should offset some of the pain.

The best-case scenario for Intel is for it to start to reverse AMD's market share gains in the PC and server chip markets while winning foundry customers that have become overly dependent on market leader TSMC. Being a U.S.-based manufacturer is a big advantage. TSMC is based in Taiwan which is caught in the middle of tense relations between the U.S. and China.

Relative to sales Intel stock is about the cheapest it's been in decades. That's not enough of a reason on its own to buy the stock but it gives a sense of how pessimistic the market has become on the semiconductor giant. The reason to buy Intel is its potential to reclaim its dominance in PC and server chips while building a multi-billion-dollar foundry business that benefits from the growth of the broader semiconductor market.

The next few years will be messy for Intel as it cuts costs brings new server chips to market and continues to lay the foundation of its foundry business. But if the company succeeds even partially the stock could be worth a lot more down the road.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9kb2N0b3ItY29yb25hdGlvbi1zdHJlZXQtc3Rhci1taWxsaWUtMDkyMTM1MDUxLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Doctor Who: Coronation Street star Millie Gibson announced as Ncuti Gatwa's companion,"Millie Gibson was announced as Doctor Who’s next companion live on BBC One’s Children in Need on Friday (18 November).

The 18-year-old Coronation Street star will join the series alongside Ncuti Gatwa who will succeed returning star David Tennant as the Time Lord.

The young actor said she hopes to “make you all happy” and fill the shoes of companions past in the upcoming series. For her portrayal of Kelly in Corrie Gibson won the British Soap Award for Best Young Actor in 2022.

Gibson also announced that her character’s name would be Ruby Sunday (though did not reveal the spelling of her surname when asked if it was “Sunday” or “Sundae”).

Tennant will return as the Doctor for three episodes in November 2023 alongside former companion Donna Noble (Catherine Tate). Heartstopper’s Yasmin Finney will also feature in the specials.

The return of Tennant came at the end of Jodie Whittaker’s final outing which was broadcast last month.

Gatwa shot to fame starring as Eric Effiong in the Netflix hit series Sex Education. His first Doctor Who episode will air over the Christmas period in 2023.

Speaking about his casting when it was revealed in May Gatwa said he was “deeply honoured beyond excited and of course a little bit scared”.

He continued: “This role and show means so much to so many around the world including myself and each one of my incredibly talented predecessors has handled that unique responsibility and privilege with the utmost care. I will endeavour my utmost to do the same.”

Gatwa’s series will also mark the return of former showrunner Russell T Davies as head writer on Doctor Who.

Davies who was responsible for reviving the sci-fi series in 2005 started auditions for Whittaker’s replacement last December and said that Gatwa had “dazzled” him.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzExLzE5L3dpbGwtdGFpd2FuLXNlbWljb25kdWN0b3ItbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy1iZS1hLXRyaWxsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Be a Trillion-Dollar Stock by 2032?,"The pure-play semiconductor foundry has a massive tailwind at its back.

Famous investor Warren Buffett created quite a stir the other day when his company Berkshire Hathaway revealed a new 60-million share stake in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -0.56%) worth $4.8 billion. The company bought so much it's now one of its top-10 holdings.

As the world's largest semiconductor foundry Taiwan Semiconductor manufactures integrated circuits based on designs provided by its clients including the likes of Advanced Micro Devices Broadcom Intel and Nvidia.

Yet the industry has been mired in problems born of the COVID-19 pandemic and shortages have been rife throughout the supply chain. Taiwan Semiconductor has also suffered as a result of the geopolitical tensions surrounding China and Taiwan and its stock had lost some 40% of its value before the company reported better-than-expected third quarter earnings.

Over the past month and combined with Buffett's buy the semiconductor stock has since climbed 27% though its shares are still down 37% since the beginning of the year. With a market capitalization of over $350 billion Taiwan Semiconductor needs to roughly triple from its current valuation to achieve trillion-dollar status. Is that feasible? Let's find out.

An expanding global footprint

As noted Taiwan Semiconductor counts some of the largest chip companies as customers. Because so many are U.S.-based tech stocks last year it began construction of a $12 billion 5-nanometer chip fabrication plant in northern Arizona that should become operational in the first quarter of 2024 (TSM has had a presence in the state for 40 years).

It's no coincidence that Apple recently announced that it will begin buying more of the chips it needs for its consumer electronics from a plant in Arizona that will become operational in 2024. Taiwan Semi already manufactures its A- and M-series processors which are used in its iPhones and Mac computers.

In fact demand from customers is reportedly so strong that Taiwan Semiconductor says it will begin constructing a second plant in Arizona. It's also building a foundry in Japan.

It already generates over half of all global foundry revenue and owns 84% of the sub-10 nanometer chip market.

Out front and pulling away

For as much as Buffett really disliked technology stocks early on he has grown increasingly comfortable investing in the space -- Apple is his largest holding by far. It could be that he sees Taiwan Semiconductor in the same way: the dominant player in its field that few can touch and that consumers absolutely rely upon.

That's apparent in Taiwan Semiconductor's third-quarter earnings report which showed revenue jumped 36% to $20.2 billion while profits surged 80% to $8.8 billion. While much of the rest of the world was constrained by shortages the semiconductor leader previously said it had not been impacted much by the sector's downturn because long-term demand was ""firmly in place.""

Trends such as the rollout of 5G networks the advent and importance of data centers for housing company information and the increased growth among consumer electronics and autos kept its factories humming along.

While it has struck a more cautious outlook today than it did after releasing its second-quarter report trimming its expected capital expenditures for 2022 from $40 billion to $36 billion due to equipment delays the long-term outlook for the chip stock remains bright.

Trillion-dollar baby

Taiwan Semiconductor's next closest competitor United Microelectronics is a distant second with just a 13% share of the market and its next-gen N3 processor is generating such strong demand from the likes of Apple AMD and Intel that it is actually pressuring its engineering capacity.

The semiconductor industry is definitely a cyclical one so Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing will certainly have ups and downs in the years to come. Yet barring China's invasion of Taiwan U.S. and China trade relations completely collapsing or some other global calamity that makes us realize we have far larger problems to contend with than chip production it seems a good bet Taiwan Semiconductor could readily become a trillion-dollar stock within the next decade.

Elon Musk forced to clarify new working from home mandate

As news broke last week that new Twitter owner Elon Musk was renouncing the company’s permanent working from home policy in favor of working 40 hours a week in offices the maverick billionaire has been forced to clarify the situation after receiving backlash from staff. Responding to a message from a Dublin employee claiming it was hard to move to the city to comply with working from the office Musk said: “Anyone who can be in office should be. However if not logistically possible or they have essential personal matters then staying home is fine” he tweeted on November 13. He also said: “Working remotely is also ok if their manager vouches for excellence.” Musk had come under intense criticism for announcing that he wanted everyone to work in the office. It has also been reported that around 4400 contract workers have already been fired in a boost to cut costs.

…oh but he still issues ultimatum to workers

Another week another seemingly HR-absent directive from new Twitter boss Elon Musk. Reports suggest that the tycoon has requested that staff click a link saying they want to be ‘part of the new Twitter’ – and oh and if they don’t it will be assumed they have quit the business. Staff received an email on Wednesday morning stating: ‘If you are sure that you want to be part of the new Twitter please click yes on the link below.’ It linked to an online form with Musk telling employees that if they did not sign by 5pm Eastern time on Thursday they would get three months of severance pay. The ultimatum comes as Musk was forced to admit that he had terminated the employment of staff who criticized him on company Slack channels. Musk who has dubbed himself both ‘Chief Twit’ and ‘Twitter Complaints Hotline’ announced that Twitter would be more of an engineer-driven operation.

Disney announces hiring freeze and job losses

The House of Mouse has told investors that it is planning to freeze hiring and cut some jobs as it grapples to reduce costs and deal with economic uncertainty. A memo from chief executive Bob Chapek said Disney would be instituting a targeted hiring freeze and anticipates “some small staff reductions” as it looks to manage costs. Chapek said Disney has established a task force including chief financial officer Christine McCarthy and General Counsel Horacio Gutierrez to help him make “critical big picture decisions.” Chapek added: “While certain macroeconomic factors are out of our control meeting [our] goals requires all of us to continue doing our part to manage the things we can control ­– most notably our costs.” The memo added: “Our transformation is designed to ensure we thrive not just today but well into the future.” The announcement follows news last week which revealed Disney had missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly earnings.

Amazon announces 10000 job losses

Despite ramping up numbers of warehouse workers in preparation for the holiday season Amazon this week announced it would be cutting as many as 10000 jobs – mainly in corporate and technology-related roles such as those in HR and its devices unit (which houses voice-assistant Alexa). Earlier this year Amazon had actually doubled its cap on cash compensation for tech workers citing ‘a particularly competitive labor market.’ But in its quarterly earnings report at the end of September executives warned investors that its growth may weaken — possibly to the lowest point since 200 amid record high inflation. The size of the layoffs would be the biggest in the company’s history and would comprise around 3% of its total workforce. The news sees Amazon become the latest tech company to slash its workforce after similar moves by Meta Facebook’s parent company Twitter and other Silicon Valley firms. Shares of Amazon are down nearly 40% this year and the company’s market cap briefly fell below $1 trillion for the first time since April 2020.

The ‘Great Resignation’ is followed by the ‘Great Remorse’

Those who quit for pastures new may not be finding the grass is as green as they once thought. This is according to new research which reveals more than 70% of respondents questioned said it has been harder than they’d hoped to lock down a good role. The data comes from a new Harris Poll which questioned workers about their experiences with the labor market. One-fifth of the 2000 people interviewed said they’re not working their dream job while two-thirds of job seekers said they had regret over failing to begin their search sooner. Over 60% of seekers said their job search had dragged on for more than six months and many say they’ve applied to more than 50 roles. Thanks to the frustration and the slog of doing job searches half (51%) of seekers said they would now take any job offer that came along. The poll follows an earlier Harris survey in March which found that over a third of respondents who regretted quitting said that in their new role their work-life balance had declined.

America faces huge spike in unemployment

Data suggests that the total number of tech employees laid off this year has hit 120000 – higher than the number of technology staff sacked at the height of the dot com bubble burst in 2001. It has led some to suggest that an unemployment spike has yet to come. For as well as high profile technology companies sacking staff The Economic Times notes big Wall Street firms like Citigroup and Goldman Sachs have also cut jobs and there is speculation Morgan Stanley is also planning to slash jobs in the coming months. Other American companies that have laid off employees include Warner Bros Discovery Beyond Meat Stripe Chime Opendoor Technologies Phillips 66 Chesapeake Energy Corp Seagate Technology Holdings Plc Arrival SA Coinbase Global and Walt Disney. According to consultancy firm Challenger Gray & Christmas Inc. IT companies have already announced plans to cut 31200 jobs this month. This figure is the highest since September 2015.

Employee burnout levels on par with height of Covid-19 pandemic

New data suggests more than half (52%) of American workers are experiencing at least moderate levels of burnout. This was a level last seen at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. The 2022-2023 Aflac WorkForces Report finds mental health negatively affected the job performance of nearly half (46%) of the US workforce in the past year — a significant increase when compared to 2021 (when the figure was 34%). Moreover despite the fact nearly 80% of employees say mental health coverage is critical only 61% of workers have access to mental health care as part of their benefits package. The data also suggests burnout inversely correlates with job satisfaction and loyalty. Employees who suffer from high levels of burnout report lower job satisfaction (55%) lower confidence that their employers care about them (47%) negative perceptions of work-life balance (55%) and a higher likelihood of seeking another job in the next year (56%).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vY2FwaXRhbGFuZG1haW4uY29tL2thcmktbGFrZXMtZGVmZWF0LWluLWFyaXpvbmEtY2FtZS1kZXNwaXRlLWJhY2tpbmctZnJvbS1jb3Jwb3JhdGUtYW1lcmljYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kari Lake's Defeat in Arizona Came Despite Backing From Corporate America,"If election denier Kari Lake got a drubbing last week it was despite money that flowed from corporate America to a campaign committee supporting her effort to become Arizona’s next governor. Katie Hobbs won a razor-thin victory last Tuesday over Lake a full-throated endorser of the Big Lie — although the former television anchor is refusing to concede.

The Republican Governors Association a political committee that combines corporate cash with dark money from politically oriented nonprofits that do not disclose their contributors spent at least $11 million on Lake’s campaign. The RGA is chaired by current Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey who backed her opponent in the primary. He told CNN in July “Kari Lake is misleading voters [about the 2020 election] with no evidence.”

After the Jan. 6 2021 insurrection many corporations paused their political giving to congressmembers who objected to the certification of the presidential election for Joe Biden. Most resumed their donations to those who voted to overturn the election. Microsoft is one of the companies that kept its finger on the pause button. The software giant also invested in a pro-democracy initiative called Democracy Forward which supports election security and local journalism in the U.S. and abroad.



Tech giant Google General Motors Aflac Wells Fargo Blue Cross Blue Shield FedEx and Walgreens all gave $100000 or more to the Republican Governors Association.



However on Aug. 18 a little more than two weeks after Lake became the nominee for governor Microsoft donated $150000 to the RGA. The software giant was not alone in donating to a committee that would go on to support election denying gubernatorial nominees across the country including Lake. Nor was Microsoft the RGA’s biggest corporate contributor.

In 2022 Missouri-based Centene Management Company donated $1.5 million to the RGA. Koch Industries the Kansas-based conglomerate donated $1.25 million. Philadelphia-based Comcast Financial Agency Corporation AT&T Pfizer and Nike co-founder Phil Knight all donated $250000 or more to the RGA. Tech giant Google General Motors Aflac Wells Fargo Blue Cross Blue Shield FedEx and Walgreens all gave $100000 or more to the RGA.

Capital & Main reached out to the companies for comment. Only Blue Cross Blue Shield responded by email before publication. “Our commitment is to improve the quality access and affordability of health care for every American and we support organizations to help meet that goal” the statement read. “While we do not agree on every issue or policy position nor do we direct where our support goes within those organizations we will continue to support policymakers in both political parties who will work with us to build a more affordable and equitable health care system for the nearly 115 million Blue Cross and Blue Shield members.”

The RGA has also received millions of dollars from Republican megadonors like Robert Bigelow Miriam Adelson Richard Uihlein as well as from the Concord Fund a dark money group connected to Leonard Leo who is credited with reshaping the U.S. Supreme Court.

The RGA funneled much of its spending on Lake’s campaign through the Yuma County Republican Central Committee Axios reported. The political organization’s coordinated campaign with Lake reserved airtime between Sept. 28 and Nov. 8. One of those ads featured a homophobic far right pastor named Justin Erickson. In the spot Erickson portrays himself as a small businessman dealing with inflation which he blames on liberal Democrats. Erickson’s views may rub some of RGA’s donors (and some Arizonans) the wrong way.



“Despite that spend Kari Lake still underperformed and underperformed most profoundly with Independents who are just done with crazy rhetoric.”

~ Stacy Pearson political strategist



In a 2014 sermon on homosexuality Erickson falsely said that “50 percent of the homosexual LGBT-Now-Q community 50 percent have AIDS. One in twenty are child molesters on the sex offender registry” Mother Jones reported. In a 2016 sermon he called Islam “satanic” and Erickson has argued that women should play a subservient role to men.

Evan Vorpahl is senior researcher for True North Research a nonprofit research firm that tracks the role of money in politics and assisted Capital & Main with the analysis of the campaign filings. In his view the corporations and right-wing donors are attacking “our democracy and freedoms.” He wrote in an email that “they should be held accountable for the extremism their dollars helped RGA buy.”

It’s not clear that the spending made the difference in an election where voters rejected extremism in close races according to Arizona-based political strategist Stacy Pearson.

“Despite that spend Kari Lake still underperformed and underperformed most profoundly with Independents who are just done with crazy rhetoric. They took their tinfoil hats off” Pearson said. Hobbs’ margin in Arizona though narrow was more than 60% larger than Biden’s in 2020.

If corporate cash and dark money could not “outspend Kari Lake’s crazy” as Pearson argues it could make more of a difference in low profile down ballot races like that of the state attorney general. Abe Hamadeh a former Army Reserve intelligence officer is a less flamboyant election denier than Lake or Mark Finchem the failed cowboy hat-wearing candidate for Arizona secretary of state who embraces QAnon conspiracy theories. Hamadeh is in a dead heat with is Democratic rival Kris Mayes who currently leads by a handful of votes. The attorney general’s office oversees the enforcement of the state’s election laws and is in charge of prosecuting election fraud in the state.

If Hamadeh wins he will have General Motors Comcast Pfizer Blue Cross Blue Shield and a long list of other corporate donors to thank — as well as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. They all donated to the Republican Attorneys General Association another campaign committee that accepts unlimited corporate cash. RAGA contributed about $2.8 million to support Hamadeh’s candidacy according to OpenSecrets a nonprofit that tracks money in politics. “Those down ballot races — the more money you put in them the more attention that you’re going to get especially with attorney general secretary of state.” said Doug Wilson a Democratic campaign strategist based in North Carolina.

From 2026 the terminal will import green ammonia from Saudi Arabia. Air Products will produce the ammonia and distribute it to end users in Germany mostly for conversion into hydrogen. “[This] is a strong signal for the entire hydrogen market in Germany and Europe” said Robert Habeck the federal minister of economics and climate protection. The terminal will be built at Mabanaft's existing tank terminal at the Hamburg port.

The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) said in its latest report that several of the G-7 leading industrial nations support hydrogen for light-duty fuel cell vehicles power generation and residential heating. “Despite hydrogen's great potential it must be kept in mind that its production transport and conversion require energy as well as significant investment” IRENA said. “Indiscriminate use of hydrogen could therefore slow down the energy transition.” It added that governments should set clear priorities to avoid waste. It said those priorities include existing hydrogen applications basic chemicals primary steel production shipping and aviation.

Masdar and its consortium partners have signed a framework agreement with several Egyptian state-backed organizations to develop a 2 GW green hydrogen project in the Suez Canal Economic Zone. They are targeting 4 GW of electrolyzer capacity and 480000 tons of green hydrogen output by 2030. Egypt also signed a second agreement with AMEA Power to deploy a 1 GW green hydrogen project as well as several other agreements bringing the total value of its plans to $85 billion. Separately the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development said it would lend $80 million to develop Egypt's first green hydrogen facility.

Ballard Power has signed a purchase order with repeat customer Solaris Bus & Coach for 25 hydrogen fuel cell engines. The 70 kW fuel cells will be installed in 12 Solaris Urbino hydrogen buses and will be sent to Polish public transport operator MPK Poznań in the second half of 2023 said Vancouver-based Ballard Power.

“Together with Mabanaft we look forward to further progressing our plans of importing needed-renewable energy into Germany through our planned facility” said Air Products’ Chairman President and CEO Seifi Ghasemi.

“As the world’s largest producer of hydrogen Air Products is in an excellent position to meet demand having committed billions of dollars to produce renewable energy at locations around the world.”

The companies added that this project addresses the urgent task of decarbonising components of the mobility sector and industrial processes while paving a climate-conscious way for Mabanaft and Air Products’ respective customers.

“We will make significant investments and deploy our energy infrastructure capabilities and expertise to accelerate the energy transition in Hamburg as the key import gateway for Germany” commented Volker Ebeling Senior Vice President New Energy Chemicals & Gas at Mabanaft.

“This project underlines Mabanaft’s commitment to conducting our business in an economically environmentally and socially responsible way.”

The announcement follows a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that Air Products and the Hamburg Port Authority signed in February 2022.

Both parties committed to accelerate production supply chain and consumption of renewable hydrogen in the North of Germany and Free Hanseatic State of Hamburg.

The demand for helium has prompted helium production companies to explore new sources of helium including extracting helium from gas fields. Helium production companies are also looking into a new way to produce helium: by using nuclear fusion. If this method can be perfected it could revolutionize the industry and create a lot more jobs.

Helium has traditionally been utilized by researchers and scientists as a safe inert gas that does not react with other elements in the global helium market . However there is growing demand for helium for use in industrial applications such as welding cutting and processing metals and printing. The main use of helium today is in the manufacturing of balloons. A balloon is filled with air and helium and when the balloon is inflated the pressure from the helium holds the air inside. This process is used to create a wide variety of products including birthday balloons raffles prizes and Decoration Day decorations.

What Drives the Demand for Helium Market?

The demand for helium has increased due to new technologies that are requiring more efficient ways of manufacturing products. For example 3D printing uses materials that can be difficult to produce using traditional methods such as casting or forging. In order to print with thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) material manufacturers need an energy-dense material like nitrogen gas which is not feasible using standard balloon inflation techniques. By utilizing helium in conjunction with TPUs manufacturers in the global helium market are able to print high-quality products without having to sacrifice weight or fabric strength.

The demand for helium has rapidly grown because its unique properties make it an essential player in various industries. Helium is used to isolate noble gases such as argon and neon making them more accessible for use in technology and pharmaceuticals. Additionally helium has a number of medical applications including methods of inhalation that help patients with difficult breathing conditions breathe more easily.

As the world increasingly relies on helium for these reasons and more production will continue to increase. Consequently supplies of this valuable resource may become constrained over time. The competition to secure adequate supplies will only exacerbate this situation due to the increasing cost of helium.

Price Volatility and Shortage to Remain a Key Challenges for Helium Market

Global helium market is currently witnessing increased demand as new applications are developed for the gas. This increased demand will continue to support prices and growth through 2028. By then the market is estimated to reach $6.59 billion. One of the main drivers behind this demand is the growing medical and industrial sectors which are both interested in using helium as a fuel because of its high energy content and negligible environmental impact. These groups will continue to be key drivers of the market through 2028.

However some challenges are expected in the near future including price volatility and shortage issues related to helium production. The perceived scarcity has led some companies to explore alternative sources for helium such as fracking gas but this could have unintended consequences that would drive up costs further. While these challenges will affect the industry over the next few years they should not have a significant negative impact on overall growth.

The helium market faces several challenges as prices for the gas continue to fluctuate with shortages predicted in the coming years. A decade-long price slump has left inventories depleted and producers are still trying to find an equilibrium price for helium that will cover production costs without driving up supplies. In 2021 the average helium spot price was $64900 MT down from a high of $66200 MT in 2016. Historical volatility in prices makes long-term planning difficult and weakens business cases for new projects. The problem is exacerbated by technological advancements that allow producers to produce more helium using less gas. This trend in the global helium market is expected to continue as emerging technologies like liquefied natural gas (LNG) exploit lower carbon dioxide prices and push down costs for manufacturing and storing helium thereby displacing it from markets used traditionally for the resource.

Despite these challenges some companies are optimistic about Helium's future. A consortium of investors led by BBVA Capital Partners recently announced plans to build Europe's largest production facility capable of producing 2 million metric tons annually of liquefied natural gas (LNG)-grade helium starting in 2020.

Potential Opportunities for Helium Market in Energy Sector

Helium is a relatively new resource and its use is increasing as the world transitions to sustainable energy. Helium has many potential uses including as a propellant in satellites airbags and industrial gas turbines. There is also growing interest in using helium for medical applications such as MRI machines and surgical tools. The helium industry is growing rapidly and there are many opportunities for businesses to get involved.

The telecommunications and technology industries are two other widely-accepted markets for the helium market. While it's not as popular as oil or copper right now demand is expected to surge in the coming years as we move closer to artificial intelligence and machine learning becoming mainstream. This means that companies such as Amazon and Google will be heavily reliant on Helium 3 to power their products and services.

The current medical helium market usage is $850 million per year. GIA predicts that this market will reach $1.7 billion by 2025. The production of helium needs large amounts of natural gas and oil which has led to concerns about its environmental impact. There is some research underway into finding alternative sources of energy that would not have these drawbacks but for now it looks like helium production will continue to rely on fossil fuels.

Just look at Amazon – the company’s AI-powered recommendation system generates tens of billions of dollars in yearly sales accounting for 35% of the company’s revenue.

When studying the impact of AI on business results one McKinsey & Company survey discovered that “63% of respondents report revenue increases from AI adoption in the business units where their companies use AI with respondents from high performers nearly three times likelier than those from other companies to report revenue gains of more than 10%.”

The right AI solution can help distributors better understand their customers make more effective upsell and cross-sell recommendations know when items are due to be reordered make their sales reps more productive and improve lifetime customer value. The case for artificial intelligence is so compelling that 88% of chief sales officers (CSOs) have or are considering investing in AI analytics tools and technologies according to Gartner research.

Implementing new technologies can be challenging – especially for businesses that have always done things the same way. Executives worry about wasting money on an unsuccessful deployment while employees can be hesitant to adopt new workflows. A lack of funding poor change management and low employee buy-in often contribute to a lackluster implementation.

Without taking the proper steps to implement this technology your business could fail to see the largest possible ROI from their AI investment.

Taking the right steps you can avoid common pitfalls and ensure your AI implementation is successful. In fact Deloitte found that reimagining workflows adopting new operational practices leveraging change management and implementing an enterprise-wide AI strategy can make AI deployment more successful.

To ensure your AI investment is effective and profitable follow these three principles:

Think Big Start Small

When implementing new technology it can be tempting to deploy it to your entire organization right from the start – especially if it presents the opportunity for high ROI and productivity improvements. But introducing technology too quickly can result in adoption challenges such as increased costs and lower buy-in from employees and C-Suite executives. To avoid this it is best to think big but start small.

For example our team at Proton recently worked with a multi-billion-dollar distributor to make their counter and inside salespeople more proactive and productive enabling them to sell more to each customer.

We thought big: what would it look like to do a company-wide deployment? What would that mean for the business in terms of revenue uplift? How would their sales reps be able to use our solution to be differentiated in the market?

We had big plans but knew the implementation would be more effective if we started small. So to begin we worked with about 150 of the company’s inside and branch salespeople before expanding. By training a small number of salespeople first we could ensure they were comfortable with their new tools and workflows.

We wanted to show that it works for these reps to build momentum within the rest of the company. So we deployed with those reps and the results were strong. Early on the reps using Proton grew 22% faster than other reps in the company. We had a meeting with the executive team including the CEO and by the end of the meeting the CEO said ‘Why are we not using this on every customer interaction?’

Another Proton client that found success with a phased integration approach was Benco Dental the largest privately owned and fastest-growing U.S. dental supplies distributor. By thinking big but starting small Benco Dental adopted AI in one sales channel. Once they mastered that channel they continued to add sales channels one at a time. This approach helped them improve customer service and grow ecommerce revenue dramatically.

Set Measurable Targets

As you begin your AI implementation define and set measurable metrics for success both leading indicators (input metrics) and lagging indicators (output metrics).

Examples of input metrics include the number of pitches site visits and how many people log on to the site.

Examples of output metrics include sales revenue profit numbers and expenses.

For instance look at how effective your salespeople are at upselling and cross-selling. What percentage of pitches are successful and what is the average revenue generated per pitch? After you understand where your organization is determine what outcome you want to see from your new technology.

Setting goals and metrics will help you measure the effectiveness of your integration and will give you insight into areas that may need improvement. Without measurable targets you won’t know how much progress you’re making or have the necessary data to grow.

It is important to remember that this is not a “set it and forget it” process. Because technology workflows business goals and metrics are constantly evolving your teams will need to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) to identify fluctuations in performance.

In its most recent State of AI in the Enterprise report Deloitte discovered that “transformers” are three times more likely to have an AI strategy than businesses that struggle to implement artificial intelligence.

In the same report Deloitte recommends that “Organizations should develop dynamic ways of assessing their strategy to ensure it remains responsive to ever-changing market and technology developments. As the organization’s core business strategy and AI capabilities mature over time leaders should continually sharpen their goals moving beyond staying competitive to increasingly using AI and ML as competitive differentiators.”

When deploying your AI solution track metrics such as:

How many pitches are being made now vs. before implementation?

How successful are upsell and cross-sell efforts?

Is customer satisfaction improving?

How many users are logging in regularly?

In what areas could results be improved?

Align your KPIs across departments communicate goals and use measurable results to track performance. With this data you will have the knowledge to make critical adjustments and ensure your AI deployment is successful.

Align the Why

Once you have a plan and have set measurable targets it is time to introduce your AI solution to your teams. In this case proper change management is critical to success. Most salespeople and customer service reps (CSRs) are hesitant to change their workflows; they have done things the same way for years and are afraid that new technology will either replace them or make their jobs more difficult.

When it comes to technology you only get one chance for a great first impression with your sales reps. Explain why you are introducing a new workflow and how it will help them. Align the “why” to each team member’s role. For instance a sales rep may be more interested in raising their commissions while a CSR may need a more streamlined way to help their customers.

As an example the main implementation goal for one of Proton’s clients (a large industrial distributor) was to use AI to raise sales. But when Proton’s team approached the customer service team for training no one seemed interested in that goal. After spending considerable time training their team we looked at the usage data and noticed that no one in that department was logging in and using their new tools.

We were trying to figure out what we missed. We did the training with them and told them how it would help them sell more so what happened? Eventually through conversations with their managers we figured out that their team cares about the customer experience not about selling more. They weren’t paid commission so that’s not what they were focused on.

After realizing that the customer service team wasn’t driven by making sales the Proton team went back and retrained them. This time however we focused on aligning the technology to the team’s “why.”

Instead of saying “this is a software that can help you sell more stuff” we said “this is a software that can help you better help your customers.” That changed the game. They ended up selling more – a lot more. But it only came because we aligned the “why” with their “why.”

How to Ensure Ongoing Success

When implemented successfully artificial intelligence will enhance the customer experience and make your organization more profitable and productive.

However to ensure your business enjoys a successful AI deployment be careful not to overwhelm your systems by deploying AI to your entire staff simultaneously. Instead have a roadmap to implement new workflows in different departments over time. Set measurable targets offer incentives and align your culture around a unified “why.”

By Steven Martinez| Photography by Jessie Dee

Dipak Chudasama BDS MSC MORTH RCS is one of the few orthodontists with a Wikipedia page.

While he has had a long career as a dental professional his biggest claim to fame and reason for having a Wikipedia page was his 19-year career as a cricket player for the Kenyan national team.

Born in May 1963 in Mombasa Kenya the same year that the country achieved independence from the British Empire he grew up in Nairobi the young nation’s capital and largest city. His father was a banker and the move to Nairobi afforded the athletically gifted Chudasama the opportunity to pursue his favorite sports cricket and table tennis both of which he played professionally.

As a child he had a hectic schedule. Every day after school he walked 10 minutes down the road to cricket practice. When cricket practice would end he walked another 30-45 minutes to his table tennis practice. His day finally ended at 9 pm and he would take two country buses home because his family didn’t own a car.

Despite the tumultuous nature of a newly independent nation finding its footing Chudasama describes his childhood in Kenya as “fantastic.”

“We would walk to school and the windows would be open. There was no crime or a minimum at that time. Things change” says Chudasama. “Life was good.”

Chudasama has lived on four continents Africa Asia Europe and North America. His cricket career included two World Cup appearances in 1996 and 1999 as a right-handed batsman nicknamed “The Doc” for his dual life as a practicing dentist. After retiring from professional sports Chudasama felt it was time for a change.

“I never dreamt of leaving Kenya to go overseas” he says. “But after my second World Cup I thought you know what Let’s start a new life. Let’s see what’s next.”

Chudasama was a dentist in a group practice in Kenya but opportunities were hard to come by in his home country he says. So when he retired from cricket he left for the U.S. at a friend’s suggestion eventually landing a faculty position at the Jacksonville University School of Orthodontics in Florida where he did research and taught students. Still despite being in his 40s he had yet to start a practice.

Chudasama enjoyed meeting new groups of students and teaching and called the experience “fantastic.” Still he says there wasn’t much opportunity to practice clinical orthodontics in the school nor was his pay commensurate with what a practicing orthodontist could make. So in 2009 he felt it was time to move on and start a practice.

Chudasama runs two practices in the Dallas-Ft Worth metropolitan area. He started his practice later in his career than most originally teaching at the Jacksonville University School of Orthodontics.

He moved to Texas and opened his first practice Orthodontic Avenue in Coppell a suburb in the Dallas-Ft Worth metropolitan area.

Getting his practice off the ground was difficult. While Chudasama had plenty of clinical experience as a professor and an MBA to help him manage the business side of things the obstacles he faced kept him from feeling like it was a total success.

Chudasama is a positive person—the glass is half full and not half empty. If you ask him to describe his past he often says it was “fantastic.” But in looking back he admits that where he is now is much easier than when he first began and was worrying about where the money would come from and how he would pay his bills.

In what is often a stressful situation trying to grow a new business from the ground up Chudasama says the pressure to perform didn’t affect him but that didn’t mean that things couldn’t be easier. Eventually his practice stabilized and grew and he opened a second location in nearby Flower Mound. But he still needed help to get new patients in the door and establish his practice’s brand.

“Playing two sports winning was normal. Losing was abnormal” says Chudasama. “From a young age when I was under pressure I was able to keep going. It doesn’t faze me. If I get knocked down I stand up and keep going. So was there pressure when I first started? I don’t know. My whole outlook on life is different.”

But a few years ago things changed for the better when Chudasama connected with Angela Weber chief marketing officer of OrthoSynetics and president of Smilebliss.

The collaboration that ensued over 3 years would become the basis for Smilebliss a direct-to-consumer practice model that optimizes key indicators that influence practice growth allowing orthodontists to focus their efforts on the clinical side.

The first positive change Chudasama saw from this collaboration was increased patient volume. Weber and her team used their expertise to create and implement a strategic marketing plan and were able to attract a larger pool of prospective customers. Weber estimates that Chudasama has experienced a 300% growth in new patient starts.

“We’ve perfected the direct-to-consumer approach in driving new patient growth” says Weber. “So we take that know-how and we can get a practice new patient leads and then help work them through the patient experience to get a better conversion of those new patient leads to starts.”

They instituted price transparency allowing patients to know how much it would cost upfront. It helped to eliminate the guesswork in the new patient process for easier conversion.

“For everything else in life we want somebody to tell us what it’s going to cost us” says Chudasama. “So I think fee transparency made sense for consumers.”

They also helped Chudasama with procurement finding better pricing for supplies and equipment. Smilebliss has an online procurement system called SAVE that allows practices to order from a single platform accessing various vendors with discounts of up to 20-30%.

The Smilebliss model includes marketing coaching and training procurement and revenue cycle management both patient and insurance-focused. It isn’t a DSO or OSO; the doctor retains 100% ownership of the practice. It isn’t a franchise either although Smilebliss maintains a consistency of branding and marketing that allows practices to access many of the benefits of the more committal corporate models without giving away control.

For new practices Smilebliss will also offer details like interior design that includes common branding elements but can be customized to a doctor’s liking or finding a productive site location for a new practice.

Smilebliss has partnered with Gaidge which allows practices to use the company’s dashboard for business insights. Its preferred practice management software vendor is Cloud 9 software and by using a single vendor Smilebliss can train staff on the most effective methods of using it.

“It’s a way for doctors to be in practice for themselves but not by themselves” says Weber. “You have a strategic support team behind you who are experts in all of these different business fields. We’ve provided an alternative [to DSOs] another option for a practitioner to stay in ownership and be that entrepreneur but then to have an expert team behind the scenes working with them.”

Smilebliss offers its services to both existing and startup practices. Practice owners sign a 3-year contract with a one-time licensing fee. After that practices pay a monthly service fee.

Smilebliss practice model helps doctors by optimizing the business side and allowing the orthodontist to focus on clinical matters. Smilebliss is not a DSO and doctors maintain complete ownership of their practice.

With the business side becoming more efficient Chudasama could fine-tune his practice the way he wanted one that has consideration for his patients staff and himself in ways that he could not previously. He calls it a lifestyle practice.

“I have a practice that fits into my lifestyle not a lifestyle that has to fit into a practice. The practice doesn’t dictate my lifestyle.”

Chudasama is a practicing Hindu whose faith guides how he runs his practice. His guru the late Pramukh Swami Maharaj’s mantra was “In the joy of others lies our own.” For Chudasama it meant approaching the orthodontics business with an abundance mindset. He wanted to increase access to orthodontic care for his community by creating a price model that could serve the most people. He also took on more staff expanding the team from four to 20 members so that if one or two people were out the rest could absorb the workload without strain.

For his part Chudasama can also be more efficient with his time. He has two locations one in Flower Mound and a new one in Grand Prairie relatively close towns divided by Dallas Ft Worth International Airport. His original location in Coppell was damaged by a flood last year.

“I think everything happens for a reason because I was looking at moving from that location” says Chudasama. “I’m a man of God. So it was a nice push towards starting the practice at Grand Prairie.”

He divides his time between the two locations evenly. Two days at Flower Mound and two days at Grand Prairie with Wednesday off and he works 10 am to 4 pm for a total of 24 hours a week give or take. He certainly could work more but approaching the age of 60 Chudasama has finally found a balance that he likes.

“Life’s been good. This is my fourth life within this life I feel after sports and everything” he says.

He has no plans for retirement now that he has found this equilibrium between success and happiness. Chudasama says he still enjoys the work and interacting with his patients so he figures he could continue working at this level for the foreseeable future. “Everything is fantastic” he says.

“I look at an orthodontic practice especially with Smilebliss as having a place near an ocean with a desalination plant” he says. “So even if there’s a drought you can still take as much water as you need from the ocean—it’s not going anywhere—but be sensible enough not to make pure water the entire day and instead balance your time between work and life and God.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzExLzE4L3NtaWxlZGlyZWN0Y2x1Yi1sYXVuY2hlcy1tb3V0aC1zY2FubmluZy1pcGhvbmUtYXBwLXRlY2hub2xvZ3nSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SmileDirectClub launches mouth-scanning iPhone app technology,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.axios.com/2022/11/18/smiledirectclub-launches-mouth-scanning-iphone-app-technology on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzExLzE4L3NtaWxlZGlyZWN0Y2x1Yi1sYXVuY2hlcy1tb3V0aC1zY2FubmluZy1pcGhvbmUtYXBwLXRlY2hub2xvZ3nSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c3Jvb20uaWJtLmNvbS9JQk0tQUlPcHMtU29mdHdhcmUtSGVscHMtQnVzaW5lc3NlcywtSW5jbHVkaW5nLUJCQy1TdHVkaW9zLWFuZC1FeGFWYXVsdCwtVHJhbnNmb3JtLUlULU9wZXJhdGlvbnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IBM AIOps Software Helps Businesses Including BBC Studios and ExaVault Transform IT Operations,"IBM updates its Turbonomic Application Resource Management and Instana Observability software to help organizations manage application performance and energy and costs to accelerate sustainability...

IBM updates its Turbonomic Application Resource Management and Instana Observability software to help organizations manage application performance and energy and costs to accelerate sustainability initiative progress

In a constantly evolving business environment many organizations are struggling to deliver on elevated customer expectations while navigating the challenges of skilled labor gaps digital disruption and increasingly complex IT environments.

With more people leaving the workforce companies lack the staffing required to manage these environments and scale them by traditional means. To bridge this gap organizations are turning to new digital solutions like automation technology to better leverage their existing talent.

Indeed the IBM Global AI Adoption Index 2022 which was commissioned by IBM in partnership with Morning Consult found that 30% of global IT professionals surveyed stated they have already implemented AI and automation software helping their employees save time. For example organizations including BBC Studios and ExaVault are leveraging solutions like AIOps and observability to more deeply understand the data around their IT operations.

To further help organizations proactively manage their IT resources in a cost-effective manner we are announcing important updates to two of our key offerings: IBM Turbonomic Application Resource Management and IBM Instana Observability. These software offerings are part of IBM's end-to-end portfolio of intelligent automation solutions for business and IT with many of the solutions developed by IBM Research.

IBM Turbonomic Increases Visibility into Sustainability of IT Resources

As COP27 comes to a close this week organizations are looking with renewed focus at using technology to align sustainability goals with business objectives – an area where IBM has been investing across our broader portfolio. As part of this focus IBM is announcing new capabilities to help CIOs and IT teams take a more active role in helping their organizations operationalize sustainability.

The new updates to IBM Turbonomic software provide organizations with near real-time visibility of the direct energy and emissions impact of data center resources to help them manage energy consumption. IBM Turbonomic takes a top-down approach to “stitch” together resources such as memory CPU and storage so that applications only consume the resources needed.

The newly released IBM Turbonomic sustainable IT dashboard provides organizations with visibility into both energy consumption and the estimated emissions of data center operations. It also provides actionable insights on how IT decisions could potentially impact these factors so different options can be benchmarked and prioritized through an environmental sustainability lens. With this operational-level data at their fingertips IT professionals can make meaningful contributions to the organization’s sustainability targets supporting environmentally sustainable business growth.

The new Turbonomic capabilities can further facilitate a companys sustainability initiatives by connecting and feeding data to the IBM Envizi ESG Suitegiving them insight as to how their IT decisions intersect with their sustainability goals and reporting. Envizi automates the collection and consolidation of more than 500 data types and supports major sustainability reporting frameworks. These technologies are part of IBM’s broader sustainability portfolio which is designed to help organizations take a data-driven approach to operationalize sustainability efforts across their business.

In a Forrester Total Economic Impact Study  Forrester illustrates how IBM Turbonomic can help cut cloud spend by 33% reduce data center refresh costs by 75% and provide the ability to get back 30% of engineering time with smarter resource management.*

Help Applications Run Optimally with IBM Instana Observability

Application errors can often cause more than headaches for IT; software problems can easily impact customer experience and ultimately the business. Teams need a way to find the root cause of problems and quickly resolve them. That’s where observability can help and it goes beyond just simply monitoring applications. Monitoring tells you when something is wrong while observability can tell you what’s happening why it’s happening and how to fix it.

IBM Instana is a robust observability solution that helps organizations track IT performance and resolve incidents quickly. In the Forrester Total Economic Impact Study commissioned by IBM Forrester illustrates how IBM Instana can help an organization reduce mean time to resolution by 50% and can reduce time spent debugging applications by 75%.** IBM also is adding new capabilities around OpenTelemetry a vendor-neutral standard of tools and APIs for collecting accessing and transferring telemetry data including outputs from logs metrics and traces (ie: the “three pillars of observability”) to more deeply understand how applications are performing. With OpenTelemetry DevOps professionals can make informed coding decisions and adjust as their organization continues to change and grow.

We are also extending IBM Instana’s capabilities around synthetic monitoring which is essentially the ability to measure your users’ perceived application performance. Synthetic monitoring will help in indicating when there are network problems between the end user and backend services.

Organizations can now also use IBM Instana to monitor applications on SAP Red Hat OpenShift IBM System z IBM Power IBM MQ IBM Db2 and more.

Organizations Globally Turn to IBM Software to Support Application Performance

Companies of all sizes across industries around the world are turning to IBM Instana and IBM Turbonomic to drive growth and cost savings in their digital transformations. Some prominent examples include BBC Studios Carhartt ExaVault J.B. Hunt Rabobank and Roma Capitale .

Major broadcaster BBC Studios is using IBM Turbonomic to simultaneously minimize cost and assure application performance of their on-premises environment of 1000 virtual machines (VMs). The team began by manually running Turbonomic’s resizing recommendations significantly reducing the number of end-user complaints and eliminating downtime in the process. Once they saw the results of manual resizing the team automated scheduled resizing on a select set of mission-critical applications proactively and holistically assuring application performance.

""Because we are able to rely on IBM Turbonomic’s intelligent automation to assure application performance 24x7 our team can now focus their efforts on pursuing strategic initiatives rather than fighting fires"" said Porsche Waddell Server and Storage Manager BBC Studios.

ExaVault an organization whose solutions facilitate two billion file transfers per year is using IBM Instana to monitor API performance and for error tracking debugging and alerting. The most important metric ExaVault looks at on a day-to-day basis is latency. “We need to make sure that every customer is having a good experience” said Tom Fite Senior Backend Engineer at ExaVault. “If a customer is waiting more than a couple seconds they might leave.”

Since ExaVault started using Instana the mean time to resolution (MTTR) for customer-impacting bugs has dropped by 56.6%. In addition the platform’s slowdowns and downtime have decreased substantially. It was at 99.51% uptime before and it’s now at 99.99%. “We’re accomplishing the goal that we set out to do” said Fite. “The reason we were able to do that is we had better visibility into our problems.”

At IBM we believe that organizations will increasingly turn to intelligent automation to address the industry-wide gaps in skilled labor supply chain disruptions increasing customer expectations and complex operating environments that are pressing on today’s ever-expanding IT and business landscapes.

It dwarfs nearby fields now barren and covered with light snow but not long ago the fields were full of corn and soybeans. Farmers went about their annual task of harvesting with combines wagons and semis coming and going.

Nearly six years ago the construction site where the power plant is was a small bustling city and an estimated 800 to 1200 workers were on site per day during peak construction. They

installed several acres of cable concrete piping and steel followed by the installation of steam turbines and other equipment.

Traffic generated from workers and suppliers was so profuse that the city installed temporary traffic signals on nearby streets for safety. Fast forward to present day and the facility’s 20 employees take their job of supplying power to hundreds of thousands of customers in several states seriously.

Fittingly named the Marshalltown Generating Station (MGS) and owned by Alliant Energy of Cedar Rapids it is a natural gas-fired plant that became operational April 1 2017. It was nearly 10 years in the making required 2 ½ years to build and cost $645 million.

“It is a combined-cycle facility” said Morgan Hawk an Alliant spokesperson. “A combined-cycle facility is an efficient model of using two gas turbines to turn two generators by means of internal combustion. The exhaust a byproduct of combustion is then passed through a Heat Recovery Steam Generator which has thousands of tubes that capture heat from the exhaust and convert water to steam. That steam is then used to power (spin) a steam turbine that turns another generator thus increasing the overall efficiency of the plant.”

A sophisticated solar-power collection and generating system was put into service in October 2020. With full sun solar panels can fully charge a nearby battery within two hours. When discharged the battery can power nearly 200 homes for two hours.

Others took notice of Alliant’s investment.

“The MGS was the first infrastructure project in Iowa to receive the Envision Platinum Award. The Envision system rates the sustainability of infrastructure projects across a full range of environmental social and economic impacts and the Platinum award is the highest attainable Envision recognition award” said Hawk.

For a time electricity-generating plants were fired by coal due to cost and availability. The former Sutherland Generating Station (SGS) in the 3000 block of East Main Street in Marshalltown — and also owned by Alliant — burned trainloads of coal over the years to supply electrical needs to its thousands of customers.

“The SGS ceased operations in June 2017 following the construction of the MGS” said Hawk. “Alliant Energy completed the implosion of SGS in August 2019. Closure of the coal-fired is an example of our transition to cleaner renewable energy. Alliant Energy still owns the property and maintains three small fast-start generators on the site that were installed in the mid-1970s. The rest of the site has been returned to native prairie grass.”

With two major natural gas pipelines near Marshalltown and a plentiful supply of clean water from the Marshalltown Water Works Alliant officials believed natural gas was the most cost-efficient and environmentally friendly resource.

“It (MGS) emits less than half the carbon dioxide about two-thirds less nitrogen and roughly 99 percent less sulfur and mercury than traditional coal-fired generation” said Hawk.

The dedication attracted now governor but then Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds Alliant officials then and now former Marshalltown Mayor Jim Lowrance and representatives from KBR the general contractor. Joining them were Marshall County officials.

Also represented were trade unions representing the carpenters concrete finishers electricians pipefitters and others who built the facility all without any serious injury. Looking on at the dedication were hundreds of central Iowans eager to see the new development.

In remarks Patricia Kampling — then Alliant’s Chairman of the Board and CEO — was effusive in her praise of Marshall Economic Development and city and county officials for their interest long before the project broke ground in 2014.

“We are here to recognize and thank the Marshalltown area for support of our Marshalltown Generating Station project” said Kampling.

Marshalltown beat out 160 other communities vying for the project which was extremely competitive. During the evaluation process local economic development local elected officials and civic groups promoted Marshalltown.

The project generated an estimated $50 million in economic impact with workers in the construction trade motels restaurants and suppliers benefitting. The Marshalltown area’s apartment vacancy rate plummeted to nearly zero for a time due to the influx of workers and others.

Marshaltown’s iconic Emerson Process Management supplied valves and computer software.

The economic benefit to the city and county continues from property taxes supplies purchased and wages paid.

Gene Beach Drive a portion of East Nevada Street leading into the plant is named fittingly in honor of the late Gene Beach a Marshalltown mayor attorney and civic leader whose leadership helped make the plant a reality. Lowrance presented Kay Beach Gene’s widow with a replica of the sign at a June 2017 Marshalltown city council meeting.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL21hZGlzb24uY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9oaWdoLXNjaG9vbC9ob2NrZXkvMTAtaGlnaC1zY2hvb2wtYm95cy1ob2NrZXktcGxheWVycy10by1rbm93LXRoaXMtd2ludGVyL2FydGljbGVfZDMyYTdlYTEtYzJhYS01ZDExLWExNmUtYjU5NTcwNzhiZWMzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 high school boys hockey players to know this winter,"Each season brings in copious amounts of talent to the high school boys hockey landscape.

By Paresh Dave

OAKLAND Calif. (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's Google this week introduced rules for inviting guest speakers to its offices days after it canceled a talk by an Indian historian who has disparaged marginalized groups and their concerns according to company emails seen by Reuters.

The policy released Thursday is Google's latest effort to preserve an open culture while addressing divisions that have emerged as its workforce has grown.

Workers at Google and other big tech companies in recent years have clashed and protested over politics and racial and gender equity. Also Alphabet Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc all face union organizing drives whose demands include that the companies adopt progressive policies.

The Google speaker rules seen by Reuters cite risk to the brand from certain talks and asks workers to ""consider whether there's a business reason for hosting the speaker and if the event directly supports our company goals.""

It calls for avoiding topics that could be ""disruptive or undermine Google's culture of belonging"" and reiterates that speakers are barred from advocacy of political candidates and ballot measures.

""We've always been proud to host external speakers at Google as they provide great opportunities for learning and connection for our employees"" Google spokesman Ryan Lamont told Reuters. The updated process will ""ensure these events are useful and contribute to a productive work environment.""

An email introducing the policy to managers said it unifies and clarifies a patchwork of guidelines.

Greater scrutiny threatens the free-flowing university-like culture Google has prized since its inception. But a workplace viewed as more inviting could attract a more diverse workforce that might help Google develop products with broader appeal.

In recent years internal disputes spilling into public view led Google to increase content moderation on workplace message boards and cut the frequency of company-wide meetings.

Rivals such as Meta Platforms Inc also have policies for inviting speakers.

At Google speakers have included then-U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama celebrity chef Ayesha Curry and former basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

RILED UP

Disputes over speakers have roiled Google since at least April when it said internal rancor prompted it to cancel a talk on India's socioreligious caste system by author Thenmozhi Soundararajan who advocates for people disadvantaged by caste prejudice.

Members of an internal Hindu group had complained about Soundararajan describing her rhetoric as inflammatory a charge she calls bigoted.

At least one of the critics suggested inviting for balance Rajiv Malhotra according to an internal message. Malhotra a tech entrepreneur turned self-described contrarian author has labeled activists such as Soundararajan as ""snakes"" and criticized affirmative action policies that promote lower caste groups.

The Hindu group at Google eventually scheduled Malhotra to speak about India's positive global influence according to an invitation. But organizers canceled Nov. 10 the day before the planned talk at Google offices in Silicon Valley according to a follow-up announcement.

Some workers complained to senior management about Malhotra according to a message soliciting complaints. A linked document organized by Alphabet Workers Union a labor organization that has been petitioning Google to name caste in its non-discrimination policies noted Malhotra had described homosexuality as a medical condition and Islam as a destructive force.

Malhotra told Reuters he supports marginalized communities but opposes ""politicizing of bias in ways that divide societies and make them vulnerable to foreign colonization.""

Allowing his speech after canceling Soundararajan's would have amounted to a contradictory standard according to messages between employees.

The new speaker policy states that workers ""must submit a proposal and have it approved"" by a ""cross-functional"" review team. Requests are due at least 12 weeks before an event.

""Await a response before making contact with the speaker and/or their representative"" it says. ""Failure to follow this process is a violation of Google policies.""

(This story has been refiled to broaden description of union in paragraph 17)

The policy released Thursday is Google's latest effort to preserve an open culture while addressing divisions that have emerged as its workforce has grown.

Workers at Google and other big tech companies in recent years have clashed and protested over politics and racial and gender equity. Also Alphabet Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc all face union organizing drives whose demands include that the companies adopt progressive policies.

The Google speaker rules seen by Reuters cite risk to the brand from certain talks and asks workers to ""consider whether there's a business reason for hosting the speaker and if the event directly supports our company goals.""

It calls for avoiding topics that could be ""disruptive or undermine Google's culture of belonging"" and reiterates that speakers are barred from advocacy of political candidates and ballot measures.

""We've always been proud to host external speakers at Google as they provide great opportunities for learning and connection for our employees"" Google spokesman Ryan Lamont told Reuters. The updated process will ""ensure these events are useful and contribute to a productive work environment.""

An email introducing the policy to managers said it unifies and clarifies a patchwork of guidelines.

Greater scrutiny threatens the free-flowing university-like culture Google has prized since its inception. But a workplace viewed as more inviting could attract a more diverse workforce that might help Google develop products with broader appeal.

In recent years internal disputes spilling into public view led Google to increase content moderation on workplace message boards and cut the frequency of company-wide meetings.

Rivals such as Meta Platforms Inc also have policies for inviting speakers.

At Google speakers have included then-U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama celebrity chef Ayesha Curry and former basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

RILED UP

Disputes over speakers have roiled Google since at least April when it said internal rancor prompted it to cancel a talk on India's socioreligious caste system by author Thenmozhi Soundararajan who advocates for people disadvantaged by caste prejudice.

Members of an internal Hindu group had complained about Soundararajan describing her rhetoric as inflammatory a charge she calls bigoted.

At least one of the critics suggested inviting for balance Rajiv Malhotra according to an internal message. Malhotra a tech entrepreneur turned self-described contrarian author has labeled activists such as Soundararajan as ""snakes"" and criticized affirmative action policies that promote lower caste groups.

The Hindu group at Google eventually scheduled Malhotra to speak about India's positive global influence according to an invitation. But organizers canceled Nov. 10 the day before the planned talk at Google offices in Silicon Valley according to a follow-up announcement.

Some workers complained to senior management about Malhotra according to a message soliciting complaints. A linked document organized by Alphabet Workers Union a labor organization that has been petitioning Google to name caste in its non-discrimination policies noted Malhotra had described homosexuality as a medical condition and Islam as a destructive force.

Malhotra told Reuters he supports marginalized communities but opposes ""politicizing of bias in ways that divide societies and make them vulnerable to foreign colonization.""

Allowing his speech after canceling Soundararajan's would have amounted to a contradictory standard according to messages between employees.

The new speaker policy states that workers ""must submit a proposal and have it approved"" by a ""cross-functional"" review team. Requests are due at least 12 weeks before an event.

""Await a response before making contact with the speaker and/or their representative"" it says. ""Failure to follow this process is a violation of Google policies.""

The headaches continue for Activision Blizzard as the company faces regulatory pressures regarding its proposed $68.7 billion deal with Microsoft. Epic Games alleges in a lawsuit that Google struck a deal with the publisher to prevent competition.

Reuters reports:

Disclosure: We may earn a commission from links on this page

Alphabet Inc’s Google has struck at least 24 deals with big app developers to stop them from competing with its Play Store including an agreement to pay Activision Blizzard Inc about $360 million over three years according to a court filing on Thursday. Google also agreed in 2020 to pay Tencent Holdings Ltd’s Riot Games unit which makes “League of Legends” about $30 million over one year the filing stated. The financial details emerged in a newly unredacted copy of a lawsuit that “Fortnite” video game maker Epic Games first filed against Google in 2020. It alleged anticompetitive practices related to the search giant’s Android and Play Store businesses.

Both Google and Activision Blizzard have denied the allegations. In a statement to Reuters Activision said that “Google never asked us pressured us or made us agree not to compete with Google Play.” They called Epic’s allegations “nonsense.”"

It also means greater responsibility for Juan Muñoz-Oca chief winemaker for Ste. Michelle Wine Estates but he doesn’t seem to mind spending a bit more time on the southern side of the Columbia River.

“The reactions from colleagues in the industry have all been of great excitement with international and U.S.-based colleagues alike being happy and excited for both A to Z and Ste. Michelle” Muñoz-Oca said.

A year ago private equity firm Sycamore Partners reportedly paid $1.2 billion to tobacco conglomerate Altria for Ste. Michelle Wine Estates. It was a deal orchestrated by Bank of the West.

It was no secret in the Oregon wine industry that A to Z Wineworks was on the market. Who provided financing for A to Z for the past 15 years? Bank of the West.

Considering that Adam Beak managing director of the bank’s beverage division knows the balance sheets and desires of both companies the September sale was a natural match. Much of A to Z’s production is dedicated to approachable Pinot Noir in the $20-$25 range — an attractive tier for Ste. Michelle.

Beak also has a sense of the value of the Woodinville real estate Ste. Michelle placed on the market not long before the A to Z sale was announced. Wine is no longer produced on the Woodinville campus and Ste. Michelle officials acknowledge the possibility that its tasting gallery connected to the iconic château could be leased back to Ste. Michelle as part of a deal.

So in less than a year of formal ownership Sycamore — with holdings that include Staples Lane Bryant and Ann Taylor — went big again in the Pacific Northwest wine industry.

Earlier this year Wine Business Monthly magazine research ranked Ste. Michelle at No. 8 in the U.S. for wine production with 8.2 million cases. Château Ste. Michelle accounted for 3.1 million cases. Next was 14 Hands at 1.3 million cases.

With the Oregon acquisitions — the two brands produce about 400000 cases — SMWE moves closer to No. 7 Bronco Wine Co. which WBM estimated produces 9 million cases. (Bronco founder Fred Franzia died Sept. 13 at the age of 79.)

E. & J. Gallo Winery which owns Columbia Winery across the street from Château Ste. Michelle dominates the U.S. industry with an estimated 100 million cases. The Wine Group is a distant second at 51 million.

Weighing in at No. 11 with 3.2 million cases is Seattle-based Precept the privately owned company led by Andrew Browne who grew up in Spokane. A substantial portion of its portfolio is in Oregon and in Pinot Noir.

A to Z Wineworks was created in 2002 and owned by Bill and Deb Hatcher Sam Tannahill and Cheryl Francis. Each came with a background of helping to lead some of Oregon’s most famous wineries. In 20 years they grew A to Z Wineworks to 365000 cases. Rex Hill a respected winery they purchased in 2006 makes about 30000 cases.

“We could not have found a better partner than Ste. Michelle to carry on the legacy of both A to Z and Rex Hill” Deb Hatcher stated in a news release. “They understand the Pacific Northwest better than anyone and they know what it takes to promote an entire region on the global stage.”

She Francis and Tannahill become consultants for Ste. Michelle. Bill Hatcher enters retirement. Amy Prosenjak president and CEO of A to Z joins SMWE as president of Oregon Brands. That includes Erath Winery which Ste. Michelle purchased in 2006. When combined it positions Ste. Michelle as the largest producer of Oregon wine at about 800000 cases. According to Wine Business Monthly reporting the state’s largest single vintner is Union Wine Co. at 480000 cases.

Ed King CEO and co-founder of King Estate Winery with 300000 cases to sell each year shared with me that he doesn’t view the acquisition by Ste. Michelle as the move of a competitor.

“This further establishes the value the wine world places on Oregon wines and is a strong testament to the success of our longtime friends and colleagues Deb Hatcher Sam Tannahill Bill Hatcher and Cheryl Francis” King said. “They have labored long and hard to get to this point and I personally doubt that these dynamos will stay on the sidelines for long.

“In the long term this can only bode well for the Oregon wine industry” King added. “King Estate is honored to continue working alongside these and so many other outstanding vintners for years to come.”

For decades critics of Ste. Michelle Wine Estates were quick to point out its links to the tobacco industry. It’s worth noting U.S. Tobacco of Connecticut which bought Ste. Michelle in 1974 replanted Cold Creek Vineyard after the devastating winter of 1978. At the time Cold Creek — a warm site west of the Wahluke Slope and recommended to Ste. Michelle by the late Walter Clore — was the state’s largest planting at 500 acres. It’s difficult to imagine anyone other than “Big Tobacco” being willing and able to invest twice in a vineyard that large.

We all know that anything is for sale — if the price is attractive enough. Right now though it would seem Ste. Michelle Wine Estates is charting a course as the largest wine company in the Pacific Northwest. And talented winemakers remain in place to do the work that matters most to consumers.",,,,,,,,,,,,

As he had in his campaign Lula pledged to stop rampant deforestation in the Amazon which his predecessor Jair Bolsanaro had encouraged.

Forests play a critical role in slowing climate change by taking up carbon dioxide and the Amazon rainforest absorbs one-fourth of the CO2 absorbed by all the land on Earth. These articles from The Conversation’s archive examine stresses on the Amazon and the Indigenous groups who live there.

1. Massive losses

The Amazon rainforest is vast covering some 2.3 million square miles (6 million square kilometers). It extends over eight countries with about 60% of it in Brazil. And the destruction occurring there is also enormous.

From 2010 to 2019 the Amazon lost 24000 square miles (62000 square kilometers) of forest – the equivalent of about 10.3 million U.S. football fields. Much of this land was turned into cattle ranches farms and palm oil plantations.

“There are a number of reasons why this deforestation matters – financial environmental and social” wrote Washington University in St. Louis data scientist Liberty Vittert explaining why she and other judges chose Amazon deforestation as the Royal Statistical Society’s International Statistic of the Decade.

Forest clearance in the region threatens people wild species and freshwater supplies along with the climate. “The farmers commercial interest groups and others looking for cheap land all have a clear vested interest in deforestation going ahead but any possible short-term gain is clearly outweighed by long-term loss” Vittert concluded.

2. Legalizing land grabs

Much of the Amazon has been under state control for decades. In the 1970s Brazil’s military government started encouraging farmers and miners to move into the region to spur economic development while also setting some zones aside for conservation. More recently however Brazil’s government has made it easier for wealthy interests to seize large swaths of land – including in conservation areas and Indigenous territories.

Reviewing national laws and land holdings University of Florida geographers Gabriel Cardoso Carrero Cynthia S. Simmons and Robert T. Walker found that Brazil’s National Congress was expanding the legal size of private holdings in the Amazon even before Bolsonaro was elected in 2019.

In southern Amazonas state Amazonia’s most active deforestation frontier rates of deforestation started to rise in 2012 because of loosened regulatory oversight. The number and size of clearings that the researchers identified using satellite data increased after Bolsonaro took office.

“Because of policy interventions and the greening of agricultural supply chains deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon fell after 2005 reaching a low point in 2012 when it began trending up again because of weakening environmental governance and reduced surveillance” they observed. “In our view the global community can help by insisting that supply chains for Amazonian beef and soybean products originate on lands deforested long ago and whose legality is long-standing.”

3. Indigenous resistance

Road building in the Amazon which increased dramatically during Bolsonaro’s tenure brings development and related threats like wildfires into wild areas. University of Richmond geographer David Salisbury also saw it as an existential threat to Indigenous communities.

Indigenous residents of the Brazilian-Peruvian borderlands where Salisbury worked “understand that the loggers and their tractors and chainsaws are the sharp point of a road allowing coca growers land traffickers and others access to traditional Indigenous territories and resources” Salisbury reported. “They also realize that their Indigenous communities may be all that stands in defense of the forest and stops invaders and road builders.”

Several Indigenous women won office as federal deputies in Brazil’s recent elections and Lula has pledged to protect Indigenous people’s rights. Salisbury saw it as crucial to ensure that Indigenous defenders of the Amazon receive “the support and educational opportunities needed to be safe prosperous and empowered to protect their rainforest home.”

4. Five global deforestation drivers: Beef soy palm oil wood – and crime

A small handful of highly lucrative commodities are the main causes of deforestation in the Amazon and other tropical regions around the world. In Brazil much of the land is cleared for raising beef cattle or cultivating soy. In Indonesia and Malaysia palm oil production is spurring large-scale rainforest destruction. Wood production for pulp and paper products as well as fuel is also a major driver in Asia and Africa.

“Making the supply chains for these four commodities more sustainable is an important strategy for reducing deforestation” wrote Texas State University geographer Jennifer Devine. But Devine also found a fifth factor interwoven with these four industries: organized crime.

“Large lucrative industries offer opportunities to move and launder money; as a result in many parts of the world deforestation is driven by the drug trade” she reported. In the Amazon for example drug traffickers are illegally logging forests and hiding cocaine in timber shipments to Europe.

“Promoting sustainable production and consumption are critical to halting deforestation worldwide. But in my view national and industry leaders also have to root organized crime and illicit markets out of these commodity chains” Devine concluded.

RIO BRANCO Brazil — In her 60 years of life in the Amazon Antonia Franco dos Santos has never had much money. Food was sometimes scarce. But never in the forest with its heavy rains and endless rivers had she known a life without water — not until she moved to this city along the southern crest where her reserves are now down to the last gallon and the deliveryman is nowhere to be seen.

“He’ll come” Franco says looking into the distance. “He will.”

It hasn’t rained in more than a month and probably won’t for another. The community pond that Franco and her neighbors used during the rainy season has dried to a muddy puddle. A water hole they’ve dug in desperation hasn’t conserved a drop. And inside her wooden shack this Monday morning is a stack of dishes unwashed; a pile of clothes unwashed; and an infant great-grandchild named Samuel. He needs a washing too.

For Franco this makes three drought-racked years in a row living in a landscape she never imagined: an Amazon gone dry.

“I have to hope” she says glancing down at her mismatched socks. “Today will be different. Enough water will come.”

Antonia Franco dos Santos and her grandson Davi wash dishes in late July at a pond near their home in Rio Branco. By late August after more than a month without rain the pond had diminished to a muddy puddle. Franco with her granddaughter Sara then nine months pregnant at home in Rio Branco in early April. Blankets and tarps form part of the exterior of the house. The buckets are used to collect rainwater during the wet season. Franco gathers dirty dishes to wash in the nearby pond. A truck dispatched by the local government brings potable water in late July to supply the water tank of a Rio Branco community where the wells have gone dry.

For years scientists have been warning that the Amazon is speeding toward a tipping point — the moment when deforestation and global warming would trigger an irreversible cascade of climatic forces killing large swaths of what remained. If somewhere between 20 and 25 percent of the forest were lost models suggested much of the Amazon would perish.

About 18 percent of the rainforest is now gone and the evidence increasingly supports the warnings. Whether or not the tipping point has arrived — and some scientists think it has — the Amazon is beginning to collapse.

More than three-quarters of the rainforest research indicates is showing signs of lost resilience. In fire-scorched areas of the Rio Negro floodplains one research group noted a “drastic ecosystem shift” that has reduced jungle to savanna. In the southeastern Amazon which has been assaulted by rapacious cattle ranching trees are dying off and being pushed aside by species better acclimated to drier climes. In the southwestern Amazon fast-growing bamboo is overtaking lands ravaged by fire and drought. And in the devastated transitional forests of Mato Grosso state researchers believe a local tipping point is imminent.

The rainforest has never been closer to what scientists predict would be a global calamity. Because it stores an estimated 123 billion tons of carbon the Amazon is seen as vital to forestalling catastrophic global warming. But during the presidency of Jair Bolsonaro who supports its development deforestation has risen to a 15-year high. Parts of the forest now emit more carbon than they absorb. If the rest follows the impact will be felt all over the world.

The stakes are highest in the forest itself where millions of people are for the first time reckoning with a hotter smokier and drier Amazon. Strange sights are being reported: Wells that have gone dry. Streams that have vanished. The arrival of the maned wolf a species native to South American savannas. Even a scourge familiar elsewhere in Brazil but not here: thirst.

To report this story Terrence McCoy who covers Brazil for The Washington Post made three visits to Rio Branco this year following one family's story as they tried to survive an extreme drought with insufficient water. Local journalist Alexandre Cruz-Noronha photographed the city monthly from April to September during another punishing dry season.

One place in its stranglehold is the remote city of Rio Branco in Acre state where scientists fear that the climate has already changed. Every rainy season seems to bring floods when the rivers swell with runoff once caught by the forest. And nearly every dry season ushers in a drought when a growing number of people are forced to choose between using dirty water or none at all.

The impact on public health is already apparent particularly among the young. Acre state was struck by an outbreak of acute diarrhea last year that killed two children and cases surged again this year. Smoke from rampant forest fires has so polluted Rio Branco’s air that dozens of people are sent to hospitals every dry season with respiratory illnesses.

The community beset by another punishing drought this year is taking extraordinary steps to survive. Each morning the local government dispatches a fleet of tank trucks bearing water to a greater number of locations than ever before: schools hospitals the prison and a swelling number of impoverished communities not connected to the municipal water line where historic sources are running dry and daily existence is now organized around the deliveries.

They come to Franco’s enclave twice a week on Mondays and Thursdays when residents replenish their reserves and the tense wait for the next delivery begins anew.

On that Monday morning in late August Franco hears the water truck’s arrival just after 9 o’clock. But she doesn’t move. The eight households in this pocket of the Adauto Frota slum draw water in order of their proximity to the communal tank. And Franco’s shack which she shares with her 17-year-old granddaughter the girl’s boyfriend and their son is the second-farthest away.

On the best of days Franco might get almost all her share quieting her worries over what might befall baby Samuel — diarrhea dehydration something worse — if they don’t receive enough water. But this morning is hot and dry. The community has gone four days since the last delivery. She wants to believe a spirit of sharing will trump individual need but when she finally gets the community hose it’s late. The sun is setting. She puts the hose into her tank and steps back.

The water comes out in a trickle.

“It’s weak” she says anxiety in her voice.

She adjusts the hose twisting it this way and that. But the flow is still too weak. Others have taken far more than their share. It will be hours before the tank fills if it does at all. She looks back at her house.

The stack of dishes. The pile of clothes. And most pressingly Samuel.

“We just have to hope” she says.

The Acre state flag flies in smoky skies over the Acre River in Rio Branco on Aug. 25. ‘The tipping point is here’

In the 1970s Brazilian researcher Enéas Salati upended much of what scientists thought they knew about the Amazon. Until then it was believed that the forest’s abundant rain was a function of climate. But by studying oxygen isotopes in rainwater throughout the Amazon Salati found that about half of the precipitation was recycled. There had been a hidden source of water in the Amazon all along Salati discovered: the forest itself.

Water cycles through the biome to be used and reused. The trees with deep root systems drink up rainwater then secrete the moisture into the atmosphere. Easterly winds from the Atlantic then carry it farther inland where it forms into rain and the process repeats. A single water molecule can be recycled up to six times.

“An almost unique precipitation and water-recycling regime” Salati called it.

Your browser does not support the video element. The Amazon forest is an ecosystem bound together by wind and rain. Trees drink up the rainfall and release it back into the atmosphere in a recycling process known as evapotranspiration. Winds take this airborne moisture deeper inland where it forms into rainfall again — and then again. During the dry season the forest is particularly dependent on itself to survive. Deep roots pump up moisture stored in the soil which is then released by pores in the trees’ leaves. But deforestation corrodes the system. Fewer trees mean less evapotranspiration. Less rain. And less moisture carried deeper into the forest. A drier warmer forest is more vulnerable to fire and drought. Species better suited to drier conditions gain greater dominance. Global warming accelerates the process. The rainforest is no longer able to maintain the hydrological system on which it depends. The damage accelerates and spreads. Local tipping points are breached putting more forest in danger.

This understanding became the foundation for a new field of study much of which would focus on the same urgent questions. If the hydrological cycle that sustains the Amazon is dependent on its flora what happens when the vegetation is cut down? How much deforestation can the system withstand? Is there a point of no return and if so where is it?

One influential study put the trigger at 40 percent deforestation. But then scientists added the variables of climate change and fire — particularly destructive in a forest that doesn’t burn naturally — and argued that it would take much less. The forest’s vastness they said belied its critical vulnerability.

“We stand exactly in a moment of destiny: The tipping point is here” Brazilian climatologist Carlos Nobre and American ecologist Thomas Lovejoy wrote in Science Advances in 2019. “It is now.”

The region most likely to fall first is the southeast where dry-season temperatures in the past four decades have risen an average of 2.5 degrees Celsius (4.5 degrees Fahrenheit) and rainfall has dropped by a quarter. Its collapse could have devastating consequences depriving the western forests of moisture and dragging other parts of the ecosystem down with it.

The Acre River is an important source of water for the city of Rio Branco. A view from April when the water level was high. Patches of debris are seen in September in the low waters of the Acre River where people had been jet-skiing just five months earlier. The skies are clear as the Acre state flag flies over the Acre River in April. Antônio Viana a boatman who transports people across the Acre River confronts declining water levels in July.

“Cascading tipping events” is how one research team this year described it.

Rio Branco the Acre state capital is particularly vulnerable to this sequence. Distant from the Atlantic dependent on recycled rain it also sits at the western edge of the arc of deforestation where three-fourths of the Brazilian Amazon’s losses are concentrated. Over the past four decades in Acre the mean monthly precipitation from June through August — the height of the dry season — has dropped by nearly a third Utrecht University researcher Arie Staal found. In Rio Branco it has plunged to a deeper low from 2.2 inches to 1.4 inches.

“No other region is more affected by the arc of deforestation than the southwest” climate scientist Bernardo Flores said. “We see it already happening: Deforestation is depriving the forest of rain.”

The effect is local as well. When Rio Branco knocked down much of its forest it killed about 200 sources of water that fed the city’s central artery the Acre River. In the coming decades if trends continue the river will dip so low that “not even sewer runoff will go down it” said Claudemir Mesquita a former state environmental official. “It’s an atomic bomb and it’s armed.”

This now is the dry season in Rio Branco: Months of overcast skies — not from clouds but the smoke of forest fires. Days so hot that farmhands are sent home. The river ebbing to historic lows. And armadas of water delivery trucks called “pipa” taking over the roads.

Commanding the wheel of one is a thin man with thick shaggy hair. Over the past two decades as droughts have grown more frequent and people started complaining of water shortages he has become one of Rio Branco’s most ubiquitous figures.

His name is Fredy Salles. And he’s the water man.

Freddy Salles drives his water-delivery truck in Rio Branco on Sept. 1. Serving the thirsty

Every weekday morning at dawn he drives to the edge of town where the paved roads give way to dirt. The open-air compound looks just like everything around it: dry and desolate. But this is a “source” as everyone here calls it where pipa drivers pump up fresh water from an underground aquifer that for now still runs deep and cool.

As the rising sun breaks through the smoky haze Salles waits for his 4200-gallon tank to fill his fingers thrumming the steering wheel.

“Let’s go” he says with a sigh.

The height of the dry season is here and Salles who has delivered water in Rio Branco longer than just about anyone knows it’s up to people like him to keep the city running. He drives to schools so the kids will have water to drink. He hurries to the prison to avert a riot. He fuels the children’s hospital and the maternity ward. He ventures into gang-controlled neighborhoods where the state is all but absent — except for organizing his water deliveries.

His tank filled and engine clanging Salles makes the sign of the cross and pulls out into a city that every year feels more different from the one he once knew. He grew up in a community of rubber tappers where the forest was lush and the water so plentiful that he couldn’t have dreamed of it drying up. The images he sees now outside his window — roadside infernos barren fields where the city couldn’t find water the forest all gone — would have seemed so cartoonishly apocalyptic he would have laughed. Even this job seemed odd when he took it in 2000. But the work has since come to define him give him purpose.

Salles is a pipa driver here to serve the thirsty.

A water drum is filled with a hose in a Rio Branco neighborhood in late August. Salles delivers water to the home of an elderly woman on dialysis. Salles fills his truck as he prepares to head out for that day's water deliveries. Early in the morning Salles fills his water truck from an underground aquifer on the edge of Rio Branco.

And here comes one more an elderly woman on dialysis limping up to her empty water drum as he puts in a thick hose to fill it. “Every year it’s worse and worse” Marli da Silva Araújo said. “It’s a mercy they give us water.”

And 15-year-old Viviane Batista da Silva who has never known anything but dry-season droughts and water rationing. “Hasn’t it always been this way?” she asks.

And the young mother of four who watches as Salles fills a drum for her neighbors. “It’s hard to beg for water” says Luciana Costa do Nascimento 31. Her white blouse is dotted with stains she can’t remove. “But we have no water.”

Salles first saw such need just after the drought of 2010. He’d gone to a community he didn’t know to deliver water and was stunned to find children dirty families with nothing to drink everyone hungry. In the Amazon extreme poverty was nothing new but rarely had it seemed so raw. Salles began to see these people as the hidden victims of deforestation. They had depended on the forest — fishing from its streams drinking from its pools — and were destitute without it.

He encounters such people everywhere these days on deliveries that take him deeper into the countryside even to Indigenous lands where in one arid stretch nearly 90 miles from Rio Branco a leader of the Apurinã people waits for his water to come.

Geraldo Apurinã 62 looks out at the sun-wilted territory that little resembles the one in which he grew up. In front of his wooden house now runs a federal highway that changed everything here even lending its name to the reserve: Apurinã Indigenous Territory kilometer 124 BR-317.

Highway BR-317 built in 1956 brought the loggers who razed the forest. And the ranchers who dammed the creeks to capture water for their cattle cutting off the territory’s main source. The game the Apurinã had hunted soon disappeared and the Indigenous leader saw his own people with little food and water become agents of the forest’s destruction tearing it down to become cattle ranchers themselves. Now the highway brings in the natural consequence of these losses: water deliveries.

A water drum is refilled at Geraldo Apurinã's house in the Apurinã Indigenous Territory off highway BR-317 in the state of Amazonas. Clothes dry on the line in the Apurinã Indigenous Territory on Aug. 31 against a backdrop of smoke from fires in the region. Apurinã and his granddaughter at their community's sole remaining water source which is polluted at the end of August. Cattle by a muddy pond in the Apurinã Indigenous Territory at the end of August.

The flow from the water truck gushes into his drum. Apurinã looks out upon all that the highway has given him. His grandchildren play on smartphones. His house is wooden and strong. Nearby is a small store where he can buy soda and processed snacks.

“But none of this makes up for what we lost” Apurinã says.

His culture is dying. Almost no one here speaks the native language anymore. Even the water has abandoned this place and increasingly Apurinã feels as if it’s time he did the same. The deliveries are to him a final indignity. He’s been reduced to dependency.

His drum is topped off. The water truck starts up again. And his house is left behind lost in a cloud of dust coming in off the dirt highway.

There isn’t a cloud in the sky. Just smoke and sun.

Franco readies a pile of laundry ahead of a water delivery in late August. ‘A good place to live’

For Franco the best moment of the week is here. It’s 6:30 on the morning after the water delivery. Humming to herself she puts some water to boil and makes tea and coffee — two luxuries she couldn’t have managed the day before — and glances at the dirty clothes and dishes. The thought of being able to finally clean what needs cleaning brings her such joy that she’s almost able to forget that they received far less water than she’d hoped.

“Today everything is a blessing” she says bending over to heft a basket of laundry.

Franco came here from the river town of Pauini in Amazonas state 200 miles to the north far from the arc of deforestation and accessible only by boat. She’d lived her entire life along the bends of the Purus River leaving only when her son and daughter asked her to come down to Rio Branco where they lived for work. Her son said he’d built her a small shack next to his house. Wanting the family to be together she arrived in late 2019 with her granddaughter Sara in the middle of the rainy season.

“A good place to live” she remembers thinking.

The pond was overflowing with water. The ground was soggy and fertile. Rain buckets were full. She moved into the shack feeling light and unconcerned unaware that the pond would soon dry out the ground would harden and crack and the buckets would go weeks without another drop. In that first drought the city wasn’t yet running its deliveries to the community so Franco set out to beg for water. She went from house to house bucket in hand and when one neighbor finally said “Ma’am you can have all the water you need” she thanked God for being so good to her.

Now four people live in her shack and the problem seems so much bigger. When Sara who suffers from a learning disability said last year that her boyfriend had gotten her pregnant Franco was seized with worry. She understood that the weight of protecting the child would fall on her. But the question of how she would do that in a community without water was one she couldn’t answer. She spent months fretting over diseases the baby might catch — fears that every day including on this one feel on the verge of being realized.

The delivered water is about gone used up on laundry. But chores remain.

Franco and her grandson walk home after doing dishes in a pond near their house. Franco and her granddaughter Sara give Sara’s baby Samuel a bath on Sept. 1. Franco's grandsons Davi 7 and Paulo 11 who live next door with their parents watch over Sara's baby Samuel. Franco hangs up a bedspread she washed that morning to dry on the clothesline.

Standing outside her shack Franco looks down at what remains of the pond brown and fetid more mud than water. Another delivery isn’t due for two more days. There’s no other choice.

She picks up some soap and then lifts the basket of dirty dishes. Balancing it atop her head she heads down to the diminished pond. She steps out onto a wooden plank at the water’s edge and taking care to skim only the least-murky bit from the top starts to pour it onto the dishes sun searing her back.

Sometimes in moments like this she lets her mind take her back to Amazonas to her childhood living in her grandfather’s village where there was only forest rivers and rain. Whatever they put into the ground sprouted: potatoes tomatoes onions pineapple. She’d do anything to go back there when “we had so much.” But instead she’s here cleaning dirty dishes with dirty water without enough money to pay for transportation back to the river town she curses herself for leaving.

She finishes the chore. She puts the dishes back into the basket. Walking up to her shack she sees the clean garments hanging on the line. The laundry is dry and nearly immaculate — just a few faint stains.

She pulls down the sheets and brings one up to her face. She breathes in the clean smell as deeply as she can and slowly exhales. She smiles. “Smells so good” she says and then returns to the darkness of her shack to check on Samuel.

The only thing left to do is to wait for more water.

A truck drives down a dusty road to deliver water in the Apurinã Indigenous Territory in Amazonas state on Aug. 31. The climate refugees of the Amazon

For many scientists the most pressing question is no longer whether the Amazon is reaching a tipping point but what will come after. Some say the biome that rises from the fires will be a degraded open-canopy forest. Others say it will remain closed but deformed. But perhaps the most likely outcome is far more drastic — the destroyed forest giving way to an expansive grassland.

Research suggests that the savannization of the Amazon coupled with global warming would subject millions in the region to potentially deadly heat. Even if carbon emissions are reduced 6 million Brazilians could face that risk. But if emissions continue on their current trajectory by the turn of the century about a third of the Brazilian Amazon’s population — 11 million people — will face temperatures that pose “extreme risk to human health” researchers reported last year in the scientific journal Communications Earth & Environment.

The next century could see an exodus from the Amazon an outflow that would reconfigure the Americas.

As Salles drives past a roadside inferno early one morning that prospect seems even closer. Rio Branco already feels on the brink of collapse. The afternoon before during a 14-hour shift he received an urgent message: The prison was out of water. He refilled its tanks in time but found himself worrying. He could have blown a tire. Or been slowed by an accident. Any number of unforeseen events can delay the water’s arrival and ignite a riot.

The water delivery system has come to seem increasingly precarious dependent on everything going right. He doesn’t know how long it can last or when the people here will become so fed up — exhausted by the heat and water shortages — that they decide to leave.

He passes a second fire. Flames envelope a distant field.

An aerial view of Rio Branco on Aug. 25 shows the sky hazy from smoke from dry-season fires in the region. A blaze on protected land in Rio Branco in late August. People pass by a fire in Rio Branco on July 20. Urban fires are common in Acre state between July and September during the dry season. Smoke from fires fills the air on the road to the Rio Branco airport on July 21.

Salles doesn’t see how this cycle of fire deforestation and drought will ever break. Most everyone he speaks with believes that deforestation is depleting the water and that those who are suffering the most are the poor. And yet it’s precisely this poverty that’s being used to justify more devastation. The politicians who say developing the Amazon will bring economic prosperity are the ones here who get votes. In October’s presidential election Bolsonaro lost the contest but won an overwhelming share of the vote in the arc of deforestation.

Even Salles has voted for such candidates. Not because he didn’t fear the environmental consequences of their vision but because the daily plight of the poor seemed more urgent. Rio Branco has the smallest economy among Brazilian state capitals. People need work even if the jobs they take lead to more destruction.

He passes a third fire so deep in the fields that Salles knows authorities will simply let it burn.

Out there beyond the rising smoke is his next stop: Franco’s community. To Salles she’s the quiet woman who lives at the back of the enclave. To Franco however the sight of his water truck is deliverance proof that God is good.

“Today will be better” Franco says inside her shack. “Today there will be more water.”

A water truck that serves communities in Acre. The communal water tank shared among eight households in the Adauto Frota slum including Franco's is refilled on Aug. 29. The communal water tank shared among Franco's family and seven other households.

The difficult math has not changed. One 2600-gallon tank. Eight homes to fill. Franco too afraid to confront her neighbors in an area dominated by gangs is still seventh in line. But she thinks she’ll have to get more this time. Finally the dishes will get the cleaning they need.

The community tank is filled. Each of the six homes before hers takes its fill. Then her household is finally up next in line. It’s again late in the day.

Yelling with glee she runs down to the community hose gurgling with fresh water. Moving quickly she fits it to another hose and then another like a string of extension cords connecting to a faraway plug. Then she places the end of the final hose into her water drum and breathing out slowly takes a step back hoping hoping.

“Oh my God” she says.

“It’s weak again.”

She looks at her shack where Samuel is asleep. Then she glances down at the pond where she knows she’ll soon have to return and which within the month will be so dry she’ll no longer have even its soupy waters as a last resort.

She looks back at the hose.

“Just a dribble” she says.

She sits down on the bare ground pulls her knees beneath her chin and as night descends listens to water trickle into an empty drum.

Word of the reductions came in a letter sent yesterday to employees from CEO Andy Jassy describing “role eliminations” in its Books and Devices units.

“Today I want to share some information about role eliminations. We are in the middle of our annual operating planning review where we look at each of our businesses and make decisions about what we believe we should change” the letter stated. “Yesterday we communicated the difficult decision to eliminate a number of positions across our Devices and Books businesses and also announced a voluntary reduction offer for some employees in our People Experience and Technology (PXT) organization.”

The letter came after the company implemented a hiring freeze and announced plans to reduce the size of its workforce. Downsizing efforts are expected to continue into next year Jassy indicated. “Our annual planning process extends into the new year which means there will be more role reductions as leaders continue to make adjustments. Those decisions will be shared with impacted employees and organizations early in 2023. We haven’t concluded yet exactly how many other roles will be impacted (we know that there will be reductions in our Stores and PXT organizations) but each leader will communicate to their respective teams when we have the details nailed down.”

At press time it wasn’t clear where exactly cuts in the Books group took place; Amazon's Books business spans all of the e-tailer's operations that deal with books from its online stores to its Kindle operations. The cuts follow the decision made by the company this summer to significantly reduce book orders as it worked to sell down the mountain of inventory it acquired to meet the demand for books during the pandemic. At that time an Amazon spokesperson said the company remained committed to its book business. A spokesperson issued a similar statement this morning telling PW “We remain as committed as ever to the book business and to working closely with authors publishers and sellers around the world to offer the best experience for readers.""

Nevertheless the latest news is likely to add more fuel to the feeling within publishing that Amazon is losing interest in its book business. Earlier this month HarperCollins pointed to a significant drop in orders from the e-tailer as the primary reason its sales fell 11% in the quarter ended September 30. HC CEO Brian Murray told PW business with Amazon had picked up in the fall and he hoped the worst of the ordering decline was over."

He still remembers when a soldier came into his home and shot his father in the leg. The incident helped solidify the family’s decision to flee to Uganda about 10 years ago when J.R. was just 13 years old.

“What made us move from the DRC to Uganda was insecurity” he recalled.

In June J.R. found asylum in the United States. Since arriving in Wisconsin the organization World Relief Fox Valley helped him find employment as an interpreter for the manufacturer Amcor Flexibles where he translates documents and interprets languages.

“It is so amazing living in Wisconsin” he said. “As somebody from Africa living here is like a dream to me. … My dreams are becoming true in the United States.”

J.R. now lives in Appleton but he isn’t the only refugee thriving in the Fox Valley. Many refugees are finding family-sustaining employment and helping address the labor shortage in Northeast Wisconsin.

The Fox Valley has seen an influx of almost 1400 refugees over the last decade including 181 people from Afghanistan after the U.S. withdrawal last year according to Tami McLaughlin the director of World Relief Fox Valley.

The organization helps refugees secure housing employment and other necessities and works to educate local communities about the benefits of welcoming refugees McLaughlin noted. She said about 60 percent of refugees are placed in Oshkosh and around 40 percent go to Appleton.

After arrival World Relief Fox Valley’s employment specialist meets with adult refugees to discuss their skills interests and goals. The specialist generally tries to pair refugees with an employer around their first 30 to 60 days in Wisconsin McLaughlin noted.

She added that World Relief Fox Valley’s employment specialist receives at least one phone call a week from employers looking for workers.

“Refugees have good reputations for employment” McLaughlin said. “They desire to work. They want to work hard. They want to advance. They want the same things that we want.”

Many of World Relief Fox Valley’s refugees find employment in manufacturing she said while others work in health care retail and in other service industry jobs.

Manufacturing

One manufacturer that has benefited from the influx of refugees is Amcor Flexibles. In 2022 the company hired more than 50 refugees through its “Project Ally” program a collaboration with World Relief Fox Valley.

Antoinette Heenan Amcor’s talent acquisition manager said most of the company’s refugees work in production roles which includes running equipment driving forklifts and assisting on machines.

Heenan said the refugees have been a great addition to Amcor’s team.

“As we all know recruiting and retaining talent is tough nowadays” she said. “And these individuals have a great attitude great work ethic willingness and desire to grow.”

By working in manufacturing Heenan said many refugees have been able to purchase vehicles and rent larger apartments for themselves and their families as well as send money to family members still in their home country.

“How scary would it be to be pulled from your country and placed at a completely random place within the United States?” she said. “… These colleagues with the opportunities for growth that they do have they can make a better life not just for themselves here but for their family at home.”

While most of the refugees at Amcor are involved in the manufacturing side Heenan said there are three including J.R. who work as interpreters.

As an interpreter J.R. said he has the ability to help the Fox Valley community by assisting individuals who can’t speak or read English.

“I am not there for money” he said. “I first dedicate myself personally to the job by serving the community through that job. I enjoy serving the people at my work. That’s the part that I most enjoy.”

Trucking

Earlier this year Fox Valley Technical College launched a customized truck driver training program to help Somali and Afghan refugees earn a commercial driver’s license to become a semitruck driver.

The program was made possible through a partnership between Fox Valley Tech the Hidden Talent Project from the Bay Area Workforce Development Board and a $1.6 million grant from the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development.

Rob Behnke director of trucking driving at Fox Valley Tech said the program was an expansion of the institution’s mission.

“With refugees coming to Wisconsin or coming to the United States that’s our business model: We’re here to help” he said. “There are a lot of jobs — especially in the trucking industry right now — if there’s people that are able willing have the credentials (and) are qualified. We provide skilled workers for these industry partners.”

One person who participated in the program was Asha Hirsi a Somali refugee who was passionate about becoming a truck driver.

“I have a husband who’s a truck driver and I used to go with him so I’ve seen how he works and sometimes I see the challenge” she told WLUK-TV in July. “I cannot wait to get behind the wheel. I think it would be a very exciting day.”

Community benefit

World Relief Fox Valley hopes to resettle another 300 refugees over the 2023 fiscal year which began last month.

Although refugees are helping to address the labor shortage in Northeast Wisconsin McLaughlin said they also help enrich communities.

“They make our area much more interesting” she said. “They bring a piece of the world to Northeast Wisconsin and help expand our worldview.”

Through working with refugees McLaughlin said she’s learned more about the value of relationships.

“Sitting down for a cup of coffee and taking that time to get to know people is much more important and much more fulfilling than always being on the clock and always worrying about that to-do checklist and where I have to be next” she said.

By working with people from different backgrounds she said individuals start to see that as humans we have much in common between cultures.

“We have some things to learn from them” she said. “If we allow those opportunities to happen I think we can change too. And that might make us a better community.”

Likewise J.R. said many refugees hope to give back to their new communities by helping to create positive change.

“We came not only to make money here or to change our life or to help our family back in our own country like Congo or Uganda but some of us came to make the United States very strong” he said. “Very strong how? By helping the community to change environments.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Honorees included employees from across the nation and seven foreign countries.

Fort Worth-based air carrier American Airlines celebrated 100 of its top team members at a gala this week at the Winspear Opera House in Dallas.

The 2022 Annual Chairman’s Award event recognized this year’s winners for their exemplary careers and unparalleled dedication to customers colleagues and the airline the company said in a statement. American Airlines is the largest carrier in the world based on fleet size and number of employees.

Honorees included employees from across the nation and seven foreign countries.

Robert Isom hosted his first Annual Chairman’s Award gala since becoming CEO in March and recognized the team members as longtime servant leaders and creative thinkers who were integral in helping the airline run reliably and profitably this year.

‘The best of the best’ at American

“Annual Chairman’s Award winners are truly the best of the best at our airline” he said. “I was honored to spend the evening recognizing their hard work.”

Honorees and their guests were treated to a reception and dinner followed by an award ceremony that included notes of congratulations from friends and family a special award pin and $10000. This year’s honorees and their work roles encompass every aspect of operating a successful airline and represent each of American’s workgroups the company said.

Some honorees said they were surprised at being nominated.

“I was in shock but also humbled knowing that I have an entire network of people who appreciate me this much” said Sheri McCrandall a senior analyst for technical publications in Tulsa who has been with American for 12 years. “I lead a team of five people and this award really trickles down to them and all the work we do together.”

Others said they wanted their careers to be remembered for always having a spirit of both teacher and learner.

“I mentor students from the aviation school to show them the real-world part of the job” said Wendell Listhrop an aviation maintenance technician in Miami who has worked for American for 32 years. “I can pass my knowledge to the younger team members but I also let them know that they can still teach me. I’m always learning even after 32 years.”

This year’s honorees traveled to Dallas from:

Austin Texas Boston Buenos Aires Argentina Cancun Mexico Charlotte North Carolina Chicago Dallas-Fort Worth Honolulu Lima Peru London Miami Montego Bay Jamaica Monterrey Mexico Nashville Tennessee New York City Oklahoma City Philadelphia Phoenix Pittsburgh Port of Spain Trinidad Puerto Vallarta Mexico Raleigh-Durham North Carolina Shanghai Tulsa Oklahoma Tucson Arizona Winston-Salem North Carolina

American Electric Power-backed Public Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO) has asked the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (OCC) to approve its fuel-free power plan to purchase three new wind farms and three new solar facilities.

This proposed plan will help meet projected power needs while protecting customers from volatility in energy costs driven by high natural gas and power prices.

The fuel-free power plan would fund the purchase of a total of 995.5MW of new cost-effective renewable energy and includes a total Investment of $2.47bn. The six projects were chosen through a competitive bidding process.

The projects are the 265MW Lazbuddie wind in Texas and the 189MW Pixley solar in Kansas which are expected to be completed in April 2025.

Another four facilities are scheduled for completion in December 2025. These are the 135MW Flat Ridge IV wind 153MW Flat Ridge V wind the 103.5MW Chisholm Trail solar all in Kansas and the 150MW Algodon solar in Texas.

These resources will help provide long-term stability in electricity costs insulating customers from future market price volatility of natural gas and purchased power through the addition of fuel-free power generation.

After all the facilities are online by the end of 2025 an average residential customer would see an estimated initial monthly bill increase of $3.48 (2.6%).

Due to ongoing market volatility it is difficult to project the precise impact on customer bills as prices will continue to fluctuate based on variables like supply chain issues and fuel costs.

The additional generating capacity is needed to meet the energy needs of PSO customers. That need has increased due to new rules from the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) that require utilities to have available additional generation capacity to support reliability.

“At PSO we understand the importance of providing affordable service and through this plan we are excited to keep delivering on that commitment to our customers” said PSO President and Chief Operating Officer Leigh Anne Strahler.

“This investment in fuel-free power is another step in our efforts to shield our customers against high costs while meeting their energy needs.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpbmRwb3dlcm1vbnRobHkuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMTgwNTczOS9hZXAtYnV5LXRocmVlLXdpbmQtZmFybXMta2Fuc2FzLXRleGFz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AEP to buy three wind farms in Kansas and Texas,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.windpowermonthly.com', port=443): Read timed out.

The North American Electric Reliability Corp. in its annual winter risk assessment said the three regions face an unacceptable level of risk that an extended blizzard like Winter Storm Uri — which paralyzed Texas in February 2021— would lead to emergency power shortages.

NERC found that almost all areas are well-prepared for normal winter conditions. It also noted actions taken to strengthen parts of the nation’s high voltage systems and gas fuel supplies in the nearly two years since Uri swept through the central United States.

But the lessons from Texas storm and the pace of change from fossil fuel generation to carbon-free renewable power compelled a deeper look at what could go wrong NERC officials said.

“In areas where we have extreme weather — cold widespread prolonged winter weather — those are the areas that are getting seriously challenged” said John Moura director of reliability assessment and performance analysis for NERC the congressionally authorized grid-standards organization.

“Those areas sound like they’re a bit rolling the dice and that is really not the posture we’d really like to set for reliability for the [interstate] bulk power system the crown jewels of our nation” Moura added in a media briefing Thursday.

As the U.S. grid transitions to cleaner energy the risk of outages increases Moura said while the policies and investments that could blunt that risk struggle to keep up.

In NERC’s analysis peak winter demands for power are rising in some areas thanks to regional population shifts and the spread of internet traffic and data farms. Increased electric vehicle sales and electric heating installations add to the growth.

But the amount of around-the-clock generation with the most secure fuel supplies — coal and nuclear plants — is shrinking as generation from carbon-free but weather-dependent wind and solar power increases NERC said.

Policies that could ease supply pressures such as more high voltage transmission links to renewable power sites are stymied by Republican opposition to Democrats’ climate initiatives in Congress and conflicting state interests grid experts say. And the cost of all energy projects is rising.

NERC advised regulators and policymakers to “take steps to delay imminent generation retirements if essential to reliability.” When extreme weather is expected state officials should support waivers of environmental and transportation regulators to keep more generating plants operating the organization said.

Controversial analysis

NERC prepares the winter threat assessment every year in collaboration with regional grid operators. But this year’s report went beyond the usual analysis — which looks at readiness for normal winter weather — and considered the most hazardous weather and supply scenarios.

The most alarming — and potentially controversial — part of NERC’s analysis was its calculation of generation reserves in U.S. and Canadian grid regions in the case of an extreme storm that causes electricity demand for heating to spike while forcing unprepared power plants and gas supplies offline.

In that scenario available generation in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) covering most of the state would be 27 percent less than the expected peak demand NERC said. The Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) manager of the grid in the central United States could face a 7 percent supply shortfall in that situation. Emergency power reserves in New England and parts of the Southeast and lower Mississippi region could be down to single digits.

An ERCOT spokesperson said Thursday that ERCOT had no comment because the final NERC report had not been posted although NERC officials said they had shared information with the grid operators as the report took shape.

The severity of the Texas grid crisis in Winter Storm Uri stemmed the failure of power plants and natural gas system operators to winterize equipment adequately — despite a similar winter outage ten years before according to an official investigation by NERC and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. That investigation found that regulators had not required the additional precautions.

The Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) which regulates ERCOT ordered weatherization improvement after the 2021 outage. ERCOT has since conducted 324 weather preparedness inspections to determine whether operators made those improvements. ERCOT declined on Thursday to say what the outcome of these inspection had been.

In an appearance before a Texas state Senate committee on Thursday ERCOT CEO Pablo Vegas said that “in the most extreme cases” there is a risk of a gap between supply and demand. Vegas emphasized the work ERCOT has done to “de-risk” the system especially by improving weatherization of natural gas infrastructure and bringing online some incremental resources that can start up quickly.

PUC Chair Peter Lake pushed back on what he said were “inaccuracies” and an “overreach of expectations” in the NERC report.

The report estimated that ERCOT would have demand exceeding 80 gigawatts even higher than the record-setting demand that Texas hit multiple times this summer. That assumption Lake said “seems beyond reasonable.”

However a 2022 study from Texas A&M researchers examining the 2021 Winter Storm Uri found that demand during the deadly storm likely exceeded ERCOT’s own forecasts with hourly peak demand estimated at 82 GW — in line with NERC’s forecast.

MISO has enhanced readiness for extreme cold weather in the past year and a survey of generators “showed improvement” in preparations according to spokesperson Brandon Morris.

But Morris added “one of the key challenges heading into winter is the potential for high risk low probability events — such as extreme cold weather intense winter storms and/or fuel supply issues — that could impact the availability and capability of generators to operate creating challenges for MISO and local utilities to serve load.”

More coal or more transmission?

The NERC report became immediate material in the debate over climate policy.

Michelle Bloodworth CEO of coal industry trade group America’s Power zeroed in on NERC’s comments about the impact of coal plant closures on grid vulnerabilities. Almost 27000 megawatts of coal-fired generation is set to retire by the end of 2023 she said with half the country’s coal fleet expected to close by 2030.

“NERC grid operators utility commissioners and FERC must take steps to stop these closures until there is certainty that coal plants will be replaced with electricity sources that are dependable” she added.

Jim Matheson CEO of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association said NERC’s report was evidence of the risks of “continuing a haphazard energy transition” that “prioritizes speed over practicality.”

“As the demand for electricity risks outpacing the available supply during peak winter conditions consumers face an inconceivable but real threat of rolling blackouts” he said. “It doesn’t have to be this way. But absent a shift in state and federal energy policy this is a reality we will face for years to come.”

But the primary cause of Texas’s 2021 outage — and earlier coal weather emergencies in the Northeast — was the failure of coal and natural gas generation said Christy Walsh director of federal energy markets for the Sustainable FERC Project of the Natural Resources Defense Council.

NERC’s report also listed depleted coal stockpiles at power plants as among the grid vulnerabilities this winter.

The problem isn’t that coal plants are retiring Walsh said — it’s that renewable energy projects aren’t getting clearance to connect to the grid. An enormous amount of solar wind and energy storage projects are waiting to be built she said stymied by the backlog.

“If we had that in place we would be able to handle cold weather” Walsh said in an interview.

The evidence of worsening extreme weather tied to climate change is hardly an argument to relax the pace of decarbonization she added.

NRDC and other clean energy advocates have called on FERC to require transmission operators to plan expansion of high-voltage power line networks to build the grid’s capacity to overcome extreme weather threats.

Last year’s bipartisan infrastructure act and this year’s Inflation Reduction Act also include record levels of funding — in the form of grants and tax incentives — for clean energy development.

On Thursday the Department of Energy announced that it will begin accepting applications for $10.5 billion in competitive grants to strengthen and modernize high-voltage power line networks and for another $2.5 billion in grants for transmission investment.

“An estimated 70 percent of the nation’s transmission lines are over 25 years old and this aging infrastructure makes American communities critical infrastructure and economic interests vulnerable” the administration said. New lines will deliver more wind and solar power and allow more power to flow to regions hit hard by storms heat waves and other extreme weather it added.

Although the infrastructure funding sets a record for federal support for transmission it is a small amount of the total investment required to transform the U.S. power system to clean energy experts say.

Thursday the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) released its Winter Reliability Assessment stating a large portion of the United States is at risk of not having enough electricity during peak winter conditions.

The assessment says the risk is due to higher peak demand projections inadequate generator weatherization fuel supply risks and natural gas infrastructure.

Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) is the grid that covers part of eastern Missouri and western Illinois.

NERC says the reserve margins in MISO have fallen by more than 5% since last winter due to the retirement of coal and nuclear plants. The WRA report says an extreme cold-weather event that extends deep into MISO’s area could lead to an impact on generation and fuel.

However MISO expects to maintain reliability according to the report. It also says “load shedding” when the delivery of electricity is temporarily interrupted to maintain the integrity of the grid is unlikely but may be needed under wider-area cold weather events.

The assessment also points out that parts of Texas and the South are at risk for significant forced outages in extreme and prolonged cold temperatures in areas where generators and fuel supply infrastructure are not designed or retrofitted for such conditions.

Also parts of North Carolina and South Carolina are at risk in extreme cold due to shrinking capacity and demand growth. This area is also witnessing a lower stock of coal due to supply and transportation issues."

The company this week announced that its Board of Directors has determined to target completion for the conversion back to January 1 2024.

Cyxtera said the decision to delay was not due to any issue impacting the company’s ability to meet REIT status requirements but ‘rather to maintain flexibility’ as it considers alternatives for the company and its capital structure.

“Our company continues to perform well and we remain confident in the strength of our business and the robust demand for our global platform of highly interconnected data centers” said Nelson Fonseca Cyxtera’s Chief Executive Officer. “As the expected tax and financial benefits of the REIT conversion are long term in nature delaying the conversion allows Cyxtera to focus on its capital raising and refinancing process while considering alternatives for the company and its capital structure without sacrificing any material benefit of the REIT conversion to the company and its stockholders.”

Despite only going public last year via a Special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger with Starboard Value Acquisition Corp. (SVAC) Cyxtera has reportedly been considering its options including a potential sale.

Adopting REIT status provides beneficial tax status and regular dividends for shareholders but requires the company to make the majority of its money from income-producing real estate. To classify as a REIT a company needs to meet certain requirements around how it is owned and how it spends its money.

Cyxtera will join Equinix and Digital Realty as publicly-listed pure-play data center REITs. The likes of American Tower and Iron Mountain are also REITs but have a portfolio expanding beyond data centers.

Switch Inc. is also undergoing a conversion into a REIT while also being acquired by DigitalBridge. DigitalBridge itself recently went the other way and reverted to a traditional C-Corp while its Vantage and DataBank units are either already are or shortly becoming REITs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL21hcmtldHMvZGVhbHMvc2F1ZGktYXJhYmlhcy1kYXItYWwtYXJrYW4tc2lnbnMtZGVhbC13aXRoLXRydW1wLWZhbWlseS1vbWFuLXByb2plY3QtMjAyMi0xMS0yMC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Saudi Arabia's Dar Al Arkan signs deal with Trump family for Oman project,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL21hcmtldHMvZGVhbHMvc2F1ZGktYXJhYmlhcy1kYXItYWwtYXJrYW4tc2lnbnMtZGVhbC13aXRoLXRydW1wLWZhbWlseS1vbWFuLXByb2plY3QtMjAyMi0xMS0yMC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E6108A5750>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL21hcmtldHMvZGVhbHMvc2F1ZGktYXJhYmlhcy1kYXItYWwtYXJrYW4tc2lnbnMtZGVhbC13aXRoLXRydW1wLWZhbWlseS1vbWFuLXByb2plY3QtMjAyMi0xMS0yMC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2J1c2luZXNzLXVzLW5ld3Mtb2hpby1wb2xsdXRpb24td2FzdGV3YXRlci1iY2RlOWQ4ZjA5NDJhMTk5NjVkMjUzMzgzNWI1MzE5YdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EPA orders Ohio power plant to stop dumping toxic coal ash,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2J1c2luZXNzLXVzLW5ld3Mtb2hpby1wb2xsdXRpb24td2FzdGV3YXRlci1iY2RlOWQ4ZjA5NDJhMTk5NjVkMjUzMzgzNWI1MzE5YdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E6108A5C90>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2J1c2luZXNzLXVzLW5ld3Mtb2hpby1wb2xsdXRpb24td2FzdGV3YXRlci1iY2RlOWQ4ZjA5NDJhMTk5NjVkMjUzMzgzNWI1MzE5YdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRyYXZlbC5jb20vd2FzLXRoZS1jYWlyby10b3dlci10aGUtdGFsbGVzdC1zdHJ1Y3R1cmUtaW4tYWZyaWNhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Egyptian Structure Was The Tallest Structure In Africa For 10 Years,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.thetravel.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /was-the-cairo-tower-the-tallest-structure-in-africa/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E60ECE97B0>, 'Connection to www.thetravel.com timed out.

In our KPRC 2 Investigates ‘DRAINED’ series we have explained the problems. We wanted to know how the City of Houston’s water department compares to other cities. Global research firm J.D. Power has surveyed water customers of municipal utilities for an annual study every year since 2016.

J.D. Power customer satisfaction survey compares Houston water department to other cities.

It’s called the U.S. water utility residential customer satisfaction study. J.D. Power looked at 89 municipal water departments and it says Houston scores below average. The company surveys thousands of people in each city asking questions about water quality billing and customer service online and by phone.

The highest possible score is 1000. Houston’s score for 2022 is just 716.

Biggest concern? Houston customers surveyed said some of the biggest concerns are the quality of the water. About 42% of people said they never drink tap water in Houston. We introduced you to Houston customers surveyed said some of the biggest concerns are theAbout42% of people said they never drink tap water in Houston. We introduced you to people in one community who have been dealing with murky brown water for months.

Water pressure is also a big concern. More people in Houston said they have low water pressure than anywhere else in the country.

Other survey complaints include long wait times by phone and a poor digital experience. And J.D. Power said Houston scores have dropped every year for the last four years.

“We’re seeing satisfaction getting lower and as a consequence of that we are seeing results get lower and lower for the City of Houston. It used to be not so bad more recently we’ve been reporting the results to the lower end of the performance when I compare that to everyone else in the nation” said Andrew Heath Managing Director Utilities Intelligence.

The average score of all other utilities included in the survey is 731.

Tom Saunders won the big prize the Orbit World Travel Sailor of the Year Award at the annual Aon Yachting Excellence Awards on Friday.

The 30-year-old late last year became just the second New Zealander to win the ILCA 7 (Laser) world title since the first event in 1974 and backed that up with fourth at the 2022 world championships. The ILCA 7 is considered the most competitive of all the Olympic classes and Saunders’ form over the past 12 months sets him up well for a tilt at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Saunders collected the Sir Bernard Fergusson Trophy from Governor-General Dame Cindy Kiro who is also Yachting New Zealand patron at a sold-out gala awards dinner attended by more than 250 people at the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron. The Tauranga sailor was also named Aon Male Sailor of the Year and was a recipient of a Yachting New Zealand Performance Award.

Saunders’ partnership with coach Mike Bullot was also acknowledged with Bullot named B&G Coach of the Year.

A host of awards were handed out tonight which recognised success from club level through to achievements on the world stage.

Emirates Team New Zealand performance engineer Elise Beavis was named Aon Female Sailor of the Year for winning her second WASZP world title.

Seb Menzies and George Lee Rush collected the NZL Sailing Foundation Young Male Sailor of the Year Award and Helena Sanderson the NZL Sailing Foundation Young Female Sailor of the Year Award.

“It was great to see New Zealanders not only competing again but also winning again on the world stage after the disruptions brought about by Covid-19” Yachting New Zealand chief executive David Abercrombie said. “Tom’s achievements over the past 12 months were truly exceptional and he was a deserved winner of the Orbit World Travel Sailor of the Year Award.

“It was also tremendous to recognise those people at the grassroots who do so much to make the sport possible for thousands of Kiwis. I would like to congratulate all of this year’s award recipients.”

In one of the most popular announcements of the night Harold Bennett was named Yachting New Zealand Official of the Year. Bennett has been the principal race officer for five America's Cups but is also still heavily involved in running racing from anything from club to national level.

As the new quarterly reports cycle kicks in we're learning how much revenue American companies will lose because of the new rules. The numbers are staggering but they will not kill these firms. Furthermore according to Applied Materials a major maker of fab tools Chinese companies can tune their process technologies to circumvent the new rules slyly.

""We expect some customers may decide to change their plan or change their technology so it does not go above the threshold that is affected by the rules at this point"" said Brice Hill the chief financial officer of Applied (via SeekingAlpha).

A Way Out for Chinese Semiconductor Sector?

The latest U.S. export regulations restrict the import of American tools and technologies that can produce logic chips with non-planar transistors on 14nm/16nm nodes and below 3D NAND with 128 or more layers and DRAM memory chips of 18nm half-pitch or less. These are all fairly advanced process technologies widely used today and require tools from U.S. companies such as Applied Materials KLA and Lam Research.

To ship wafer fab equipment (WFE) that falls under the new rules U.S. fab tools producers as well as companies that produce equipment containing American technology must obtain an export license from the U.S. DoC. License applications are set to be reviewed with a presumption of denial so when companies like Applied reveal the 'impact numbers' they presume that the DoC will not approve any shipments to Chinese companies like SMIC and YMTC.

Applied Materials stresses that some of its customers might adjust their process technologies to avoid the new regulations. For example while Applied does not explicitly say it we could speculate that SMIC could possibly come up with a 17nm fabrication process whereas YMTC could reduce the number of active 3D NAND layers in its chips.

""There are some customers that we are trying to clarify that we can apply for licenses for or we can get authorizations for once they establish that their technology is within the guidelines"" said the CFO of Applied during the company's recent conference call. ""On the other side we expect some customers may decide to change their plan or change their technology so it does not go above the threshold that is affected by the rules at this point.""

However the development of such nodes and validation/qualification by customers will take some time so do not expect this avenue to work in the short term future.

For example going from 14nm to 17nm will require SMIC's customers to change their existing designs significantly to hit specific performance and power targets on a thicker node. Furthermore lower transistor density will mean bigger die sizes which affects costs yields and even packaging dimensions. Therefore we expect SMIC's current clients with 14nm-class designs to continue using the node and the company's services while the foundry can provide them. Meanwhile a hypothetical 17nm node (assuming it makes financial sense) might be used for entirely different designs. Of course all the assumptions about SMIC's hypothetical 17nm node are merely speculative.

For 3D NAND maker YMTC things are also extremely complicated. The company's 128-layer 3D NAND devices correspond to a very specific 3D TLC or 3D QLC capacity So just switching some layers off will affect the economic feasibility of these devices. While 3D NAND makers have some freedom with the number of active layers and capacity their devices are qualified 'as is' by developers of SSD controllers and actual drives. Adoption of devices configured differently is a lengthy process so again YMTC will keep supplying components that it can produce while it can.

All in all while many things are theoretically possible (as at the end of the day neither SMIC nor YMTC wants to write off billions of dollars worth of equipment) they are costly and they cannot be implemented overnight.

10% of Revenue

Applied Materials a major producer of wafer fab equipment this week said that the U.S. sanctions against the Chinese semiconductor industry that prohibit it from supplying its advanced tools to its clients in China would cost it $2.5 billion of revenue in fiscal 2023 or 10% of the company's revenue of $25.79 billion in FY2022. The company will keep trying to get appropriate export licenses from the U.S. Department of Commerce.

""We currently expect that the unmitigated revenue impact of the new rules could be up to $2.5 billion in fiscal 2023"" said Brice Hill the chief financial officer of Applied. ""We continue to work through the regulatory requirements including seeking licenses and approvals where appropriate. We hope to reduce the revenue impact by between $500 million and $1 billion to a net impact of $1.5 to $2 billion.""

Impact Already Hits

Applied's results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 which ended on October 31 have already been impacted by the new regulations.

Deux pompiers ont été tués par un avion qui a percuté leur camion en plein décollage à l'aéroport international de Lima. Les causes exactes de l'accident n'ont pas encore été déterminées.

Un avion de ligne en phase de décollage a percuté un camion de pompiers vendredi à l'aéroport international de Lima provoquant l'incendie de l'appareil et l'évacuation des passagers et tuant deux pompiers ont indiqué plusieurs sources officielles.

Lima Airport Partners (LAP) l'exploitant de l'aéroport Jorge Chavez ""regrette profondément la perte de la vie de deux membres de la brigade de pompiers aéronautiques de LAP dans l'accident qui s'est produit entre un véhicule de pompiers et l'avion assurant le vol LA2213 reliant Lima à Juliaca"" près de la frontière avec la Bolivie.

Un sauveteur ""dans un état critique""

Outre les deux pompiers décédés un sauveteur qui se trouvait dans le véhicule des pompiers a été blessé et se trouve ""dans un état critique en raison d'un traumatisme crânien"" selon un responsable de la sécurité Aurelio Orellana.

Les opérations au principal terminal aérien du pays ont été suspendues jusqu'à 13h00 heure locale (19h00 heure française) ce samedi a rapporté Lima Airport Partners.

La compagnie aérienne LATAM qui assurait ce vol intérieur ""confirme qu'aucun passager ou membre d'équipage n'a perdu la vie"". L'avion transportait 102 passagers et six membres d'équipage.

Stupeur sur la présence de pompiers sur la piste

Le directeur général de LATAM Pérou Manuel van Oordt a exprimé sa stupeur face à la présence des pompiers sur la piste de décollage précisant que le pilote de l'avion n'avait pas signalé d'anomalies.

""Aucune urgence n'a été signalée dans le vol c'est un vol qui était dans des conditions optimales pour décoller il avait l'autorisation de décoller et il a trouvé un camion sur la piste et nous ne savons pas ce que ce camion faisait là"" a-t-il déclaré lors d'une conférence de presse à l'aéroport.

""Après le signalement de la mort de deux pompiers aéronautiques et d'un blessé le bureau du procureur cherche à établir les faits avant d'éventuellement mettre en accusation pour des délits d'homicide et de blessures"" a indiqué cette instance.

LAP a précisé que ses ""équipes fourniss(aient) les soins nécessaires à tous les passagers qui se portent bien"". ""Nous enquêtons également pour déterminer les causes de l'incident"" a-t-il ajouté.

L'avion en feu sur la piste

Des images prises par des témoins de l'accident et diffusées par des chaînes de télévision montrent l'avion - un Airbus A320 selon les sites internet de traçage des avions - à pleine vitesse en vue de son décollage percuter un camion circulant à vive allure et lui coupant la route.

Le train d'atterrissage endommagé l'avion a continué sa course frottant la piste avec l'aile droite soulevant des gerbes de feu. Une fois sa course arrêtée une fumée dense s'est dégagée de l'appareil qui prenait feu.

De nombreux vols ont été annulés tandis que d'autres ont été déroutés vers l'aéroport de Pisco situé à 250 km au sud de la capitale péruvienne. Les liaisons internationales en particulier avec l'Amérique du Nord sont également perturbées car Lima est une plateforme pour les connexions dans la région.

Lors d'une allocution télévisée le ministre Merrick Garland a confié cette mission extrêmement ""sensible"" à Jack Smith procureur basé à La Haye du Tribunal spécial pour le Kosovo.

Un ""terrible abus de pouvoir"" pour Donald Trump

L'ancien président républicain qui a immédiatement dénoncé auprès de journalistes de Fox une décision ""politique"" et ""injuste"" s'est de nouveau insurgé dans la soirée. ""Ce terrible abus de pouvoir est le dernier en date dans une longue série de chasses aux sorcières qui ont débuté il y a longtemps"" a-t-il lancé lors d'un discours depuis sa résidence de Floride assurant que le procureur spécial n'allait ""pas enquêter de façon impartiale"".

C'est pourtant pour se garder de tels soupçons que Merrick Garland prenant acte de la décision du républicain de briguer un nouveau mandat et de l'intention du président démocrate Joe Biden de faire de même a jugé ""dans l'intérêt du public"" de charger ce procureur de reprendre deux enquêtes menées depuis des mois par la justice américaine. La première porte sur les efforts du milliardaire républicain pour changer les résultats de la présidentielle de 2020 la seconde sur sa gestion des archives de la Maison Blanche.

Chargé d'émettre une recommandation

Après avoir réuni tous les éléments le procureur spécial ""exercera son jugement professionnel de manière indépendante pour décider s'il doit y avoir une inculpation"" dans l'un ou l'autre de ces dossiers a précisé Merrick Garland. Le procureur spécial ne sera toutefois chargé que d'émettre une recommandation et il reviendra au ministre de trancher. S'il devait finalement inculper Donald Trump sur cette base sa décision sera plus difficile à attaquer. L'ouverture de poursuites n'empêcherait pas le magnat de l'immobilier de concourir mais jetterait une ombre sur sa candidature.

Démentant toute instrumentalisation de l'appareil judiciaire la porte-parole de la Maison Blanche Karine Jean-Pierre a pour sa part assuré que le président Biden n'avait pas été informé au préalable de la décision de son ministre. Dans un communiqué le procureur Smith a promis d'agir ""vite"" ""en toute indépendance"" et ""de manière approfondie"".

La première enquête qui lui a été confiée porte sur les efforts de Donald Trump pour contester sa défaite à la présidentielle de 2020 jusqu'à l'assaut mené par ses partisans contre le Capitole le 6 janvier 2021. Cette enquête tentaculaire a déjà entraîné l'inculpation de près de 900 personnes ayant directement participé aux violences. Mais les procureurs n'ont jamais exclu de s'intéresser à d'autres acteurs. ""Chaque personne qui est pénalement responsable des efforts pour annuler l'élection devra répondre de ses actes"" a déclaré à plusieurs reprises Merrick Garland.

Enquête sur les archives de la Maison Blanche

La seconde enquête porte sur les archives de la Maison Blanche. En quittant la présidence Donald Trump a emporté des boîtes entières de documents. Or une loi de 1978 oblige tout président américain à transmettre l'ensemble de ses emails lettres et autres documents de travail aux Archives nationales. En janvier il a rendu 15 cartons. Après examen la police fédérale a estimé qu'il en conservait probablement d'autres dans sa luxueuse résidence de Mar-a-Lago en Floride.

Des agents du FBI y ont mené le 8 août une perquisition spectaculaire sur la base d'un mandat pour ""rétention de documents classifiés"" et ""entrave à une enquête fédérale"" et ont saisi une trentaine d'autres boîtes.

Dans le passé Donald Trump a déjà fait l'objet d'une enquête supervisée par un procureur spécial : Robert Mueller avait été chargé en 2017 d'établir s'il y avait eu une collusion entre son équipe de campagne et la Russie lors de la présidentielle de 2016. Après deux ans d'enquête il avait jugé ne pas avoir assez de preuves d'un complot entre Moscou et l'équipe Trump mais avait relevé une série de pressions troublantes exercées par le locataire de la Maison Blanche sur son enquête. Le ministre de la Justice de l'époque le républicain Bill Barr n'avait toutefois pas jugé nécessaire de le poursuivre.

Pendant son mandat Donald Trump a également été visé par deux procès en destitution : l'un portait sur des pressions exercées sur l'Ukraine afin qu'elle lui donne des éléments embarrassants pour Joe Biden; l'autre sur son rôle dans l'attaque du Capitole. Il a été acquitté dans les deux dossiers grâce à la majorité républicaine au Sénat.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vZ2Fib25tZWRpYXRpbWUuY29tL2dhYm9uLWxlLWdvdXZlcm5lbWVudC1wcmVjaXNlLWVuZmluLWxlcy1tb2RhbGl0ZXMtZHUtY29uY291cnMtZGUtbGFycm9uZGlzc2VtZW50LWxlLXBsdXMtcHJvcHJlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gabon: le gouvernement précise enfin les modalités du concours de l'arrondissement le plus propre,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vZ2Fib25tZWRpYXRpbWUuY29tL2dhYm9uLWxlLWdvdXZlcm5lbWVudC1wcmVjaXNlLWVuZmluLWxlcy1tb2RhbGl0ZXMtZHUtY29uY291cnMtZGUtbGFycm9uZGlzc2VtZW50LWxlLXBsdXMtcHJvcHJlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E60FCC0730>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vZ2Fib25tZWRpYXRpbWUuY29tL2dhYm9uLWxlLWdvdXZlcm5lbWVudC1wcmVjaXNlLWVuZmluLWxlcy1tb2RhbGl0ZXMtZHUtY29uY291cnMtZGUtbGFycm9uZGlzc2VtZW50LWxlLXBsdXMtcHJvcHJlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm9idXp6LmZyL2luZHVzdHJpZS9hZmkta2xtLWVtLXByb3Bvc2UtbGUtc3VwcG9ydC1kZXMtbW90ZXVycy1wdzE1MDBnLWRlLWxhMjIwL9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm9idXp6LmZyL2luZHVzdHJpZS9hZmkta2xtLWVtLXByb3Bvc2UtbGUtc3VwcG9ydC1kZXMtbW90ZXVycy1wdzE1MDBnLWRlLWxhMjIwL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AFI KLM E&M propose le support des moteurs PW1500G de l’A220,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm9idXp6LmZyL2luZHVzdHJpZS9hZmkta2xtLWVtLXByb3Bvc2UtbGUtc3VwcG9ydC1kZXMtbW90ZXVycy1wdzE1MDBnLWRlLWxhMjIwL9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm9idXp6LmZyL2luZHVzdHJpZS9hZmkta2xtLWVtLXByb3Bvc2UtbGUtc3VwcG9ydC1kZXMtbW90ZXVycy1wdzE1MDBnLWRlLWxhMjIwL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E60FCC0B20>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm9idXp6LmZyL2luZHVzdHJpZS9hZmkta2xtLWVtLXByb3Bvc2UtbGUtc3VwcG9ydC1kZXMtbW90ZXVycy1wdzE1MDBnLWRlLWxhMjIwL9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm9idXp6LmZyL2luZHVzdHJpZS9hZmkta2xtLWVtLXByb3Bvc2UtbGUtc3VwcG9ydC1kZXMtbW90ZXVycy1wdzE1MDBnLWRlLWxhMjIwL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vdWVzdC1mcmFuY2UuZnIvc3BvcnQvY291cGUtZHUtbW9uZGUvZW50cmV0aWVuLXVuLXJhdGUtY29tcGxldC1wb3VyLWxlLXFhdGFyLWV0LWxhLWZpZmEtZ3JhbmQtY29ycHMtbWFsYWRlLWV0LWJlbi1tYXp1ZS1zYW5zLWZpbHRyZS0xMDRjNDRjNi02NDJjLTExZWQtOWVlZi0yNzM5MTBmNmYyYTTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ENTRETIEN. « Un raté complet pour le Qatar et la Fifa » Grand Corps Malade et Ben Mazué sans filtre,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMitAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vdWVzdC1mcmFuY2UuZnIvc3BvcnQvY291cGUtZHUtbW9uZGUvZW50cmV0aWVuLXVuLXJhdGUtY29tcGxldC1wb3VyLWxlLXFhdGFyLWV0LWxhLWZpZmEtZ3JhbmQtY29ycHMtbWFsYWRlLWV0LWJlbi1tYXp1ZS1zYW5zLWZpbHRyZS0xMDRjNDRjNi02NDJjLTExZWQtOWVlZi0yNzM5MTBmNmYyYTTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E612172590>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vdWVzdC1mcmFuY2UuZnIvc3BvcnQvY291cGUtZHUtbW9uZGUvZW50cmV0aWVuLXVuLXJhdGUtY29tcGxldC1wb3VyLWxlLXFhdGFyLWV0LWxhLWZpZmEtZ3JhbmQtY29ycHMtbWFsYWRlLWV0LWJlbi1tYXp1ZS1zYW5zLWZpbHRyZS0xMDRjNDRjNi02NDJjLTExZWQtOWVlZi0yNzM5MTBmNmYyYTTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Open Extended Reactions

Bill Belichick and Robert Kraft were front and center Sunday in what appeared to be a happy reunion during the live roast of Tom Brady.

But according to two former players who attended the roast the former New England Patriots coach and the longtime team owner also shared some awkward moments offstage.

Julian Edelman and Drew Bledsoe discussed the three-hour roast during the latest episode of Edelman's ""Games with Names"" podcast and described the scene in the green room before the event.

""Preshow we're in the green room -- remember that? Were you in there?"" Edelman asked Bledsoe. ""Bill's opening up. He's having fun he's talking war stories talking rookie skits talking fun s--- doing s--- we know what Bill's all about but it was like amplified because he was excited to see you guys because he doesn't have a job anymore.""

Edelman and Bledsoe said they were both in the green room with Belichick along with former Patriots stars Rob Gronkowski and Randy Moss when Kraft arrived.

""Then Kraft walks in ... Belichick's kind of holding court"" Bledsoe recalled. ""As he's in the middle of the story Kraft walks in and so you guys all go over to say hi to Kraft.""

""The tension in that room though could cut f---ing glass"" Edelman said.

Edelman said he tried to give Belichick a ""head's up"" when he saw Kraft walk into the green room but that Belichick did not pick up on the cue.

""[Kraft] came in and I was like 'Oh s--- there's gonna be some fireworks'"" Edelman said. ""I just walked away. I didn't want to get in there.""

Bledsoe added that Belichick and Kraft did at one point ""break it down and got together for I don't know 10 minutes at least."" But the former Patriots quarterback agreed with Edelman's assessment about the tension in the room saying ""it was very real it was very real.""

Belichick and Kraft drank a shot together on stage at one point with some coaxing from comedian Kevin Hart during Sunday's made-for-streaming live comedy show on Netflix titled ""The Greatest Roast of All Time.""

Belichick left the Patriots in January after 24 seasons with the team and there has been reported friction between the six-time Super Bowl-winning coach and Kraft over the past couple of years.

As part of an ESPN report published last month that detailed Belichick's departure from the Patriots and his inability to land the Atlanta Falcons' head-coaching job a source said Kraft called Falcons owner Arthur Blank ""to warn him not to trust Bill.""

The Falcons interviewed Belichick twice this offseason for their vacant head-coaching position before ultimately hiring Raheem Morris for the job.

After joking about the event being like a reunion and that ""unlike many family reunions there are some people I am desperately trying to avoid"" Kraft praised Belichick for what the two accomplished.

""I want to say this is the greatest coach in the history of the game that did what no one else has done. And having Tom Brady and him was the greatest honor the good Lord gave me"" Kraft said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvY2xpbWF0ZS90cnVtcC1vaWwtZ2FzLW1hci1hLWxhZ28uaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,At a Dinner Trump Assailed Climate Rules and Asked $1 Billion From Big Oil,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvY2xpbWF0ZS90cnVtcC1vaWwtZ2FzLW1hci1hLWxhZ28uaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E60EF165F0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvY2xpbWF0ZS90cnVtcC1vaWwtZ2FzLW1hci1hLWxhZ28uaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvYm9laW5nLWpldC1za2lkcy1vZmYtcnVud2F5LWluanVyaW5nLWF0LWxlYXN0LTEw0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9ib2VpbmctamV0LXNraWRzLW9mZi1ydW53YXktaW5qdXJpbmctYXQtbGVhc3QtMTAuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boeing jet skids off runway injuring at least 10,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvYm9laW5nLWpldC1za2lkcy1vZmYtcnVud2F5LWluanVyaW5nLWF0LWxlYXN0LTEw0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9ib2VpbmctamV0LXNraWRzLW9mZi1ydW53YXktaW5qdXJpbmctYXQtbGVhc3QtMTAuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E60EDD4970>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvYm9laW5nLWpldC1za2lkcy1vZmYtcnVud2F5LWluanVyaW5nLWF0LWxlYXN0LTEw0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9ib2VpbmctamV0LXNraWRzLW9mZi1ydW53YXktaW5qdXJpbmctYXQtbGVhc3QtMTAuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L2J1c2luZXNzL3dhbGwtc3RyZWV0LWJhbmtlcnMtZGVhdGgtaWduaXRlcy1hbmdlci1hdC1sb25nLXdvcmt3ZWVrcy1jb3VsZC1wcm9tcHQtd2Fsa291dC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wall Street banker's death ignites anger at long workweeks could prompt walkout,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L2J1c2luZXNzL3dhbGwtc3RyZWV0LWJhbmtlcnMtZGVhdGgtaWduaXRlcy1hbmdlci1hdC1sb25nLXdvcmt3ZWVrcy1jb3VsZC1wcm9tcHQtd2Fsa291dC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E60EDD60B0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L2J1c2luZXNzL3dhbGwtc3RyZWV0LWJhbmtlcnMtZGVhdGgtaWduaXRlcy1hbmdlci1hdC1sb25nLXdvcmt3ZWVrcy1jb3VsZC1wcm9tcHQtd2Fsa291dC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbGlzaC5jb20vZm9vZC1uZXdzL2E2MDc0NDU5NS90cmF2aXMta2VsY2UtY2xhaW1zLWFsd2F5cy1kcnVuay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Travis Kelce Is Clapping Back At Claims He's 'Always Drunk',"Earlier this week country singer and actor Jana Kramer took to her podcast to well slander Travis Kelce's name. The iHeart Radio host dissed the Kansas City Chiefs tight end for his drinking habits and claimed he's ""always drunk."" Now Kelce is hitting back via multiple insiders.

""He was taken aback as he’s never met her and is just living his life"" the source told Page Six while ""emphatically"" denying any suggestion the athlete has a drinking problem. ""That guy is under a microscope basically being watched everywhere he goes. Of course you're going to see him drinking"" the source said.

Kramer even took aim at Kelce's influence on his girlfriend Taylor Swift arguing that he has encouraged the singer's consumption habits.

""I see her drinking more now. Like the company you keep"" Kramer alleged while also calling Kelce out for his ""aggression"" with coach Andy Reid during the Super Bowl. It ""rubbed [her] the wrong way.""

The same insider went on to argue that if Kelce did have a drinking problem it would be impossible to hide given his status and constant

""It’s not like he’s passed out somewhere. If he was passed out somewhere I would totally understand but that’s not the case whatsoever"" the source adds while noting that he's just a ""normal human being"" who is ""doing the same thing"" as everyone else...only ""in the public eye.""

The three-time Super Bowl champ is reportedly ""in training right now"" to prepare for another season with the Chiefs. ""If he was drunk it would be a bigger problem"" the source said.

This isn't the first time Kelce has come under fire for drinking. During his honorary graduation ceremony for his ""New Heights"" podcast Travis accepted the diploma he never picked up in the first place before chugging a beer in celebration. However big brother Jason was quick to his defense.

""I know it looks like a graduation from the video but this was actually at the end of a New Heights Live podcast that we put on to raise money for the University’s NIL"" the older Kelce said according to People Magazine. ""The university did this to poke fun at my brother and I for never really picking up our diplomas."""

It was nebulous in both the literal and figurative senses: amorphous still taking shaping edging on the precipice of potential. And it was being crushed under its own weight—until this nebula finally collapsed under its own gravity causing it to swirl faster and faster until it spun out into a flattened disk. As it did so the majority of its mass (99.8%) was pulled toward its center where it heated into a core and something bright hot and new was born: a star.

That particular star was the Sun the very same one that may be shining or setting outside your window wherever on Earth you are reading these words. As for the rest of the matter that made up the solar nebula—that tiny figure less than half of a percentage—some of it was whisked away on the star’s solar winds. The remainder scattered into the Sun’s newly-formed orbit eventually arranging into rocks and planets plants and animals people and all our plights.

Despite how our lives revolve around it the Sun is an average star (size-wise). It sustains itself the way all stars do through the nuclear fusion of hydrogen atoms which create other elements in their cores. The energy from these reactions keeps the star from collapsing in on itself. After a star fuses all of its hydrogen its core starts to collapse and become even hotter; expanding outward average stars become red giants. Over time they eject their outermost layers until their cores are exposed becoming white dwarfs that will cool and fade away into the night sky.

Massive stars—those that are five times the mass of the Sun— meet a different fate. As their hotter cores collapse nuclear reactions will produce iron using so much energy that the star has nothing left to protect itself from collapsing completely. In the blink of an eye it shrinks from 5000 to 12 miles wide. Temperatures hit over 100 billion degrees as the core explodes releasing a dazzling burst of energy and light: what’s known as a supernova. The iron and other elements are scattered across the galaxy to reform in new combinations: new nebulas new stars new life.

And so stars are the building blocks of the universe. They create and disseminate the heavier elements that allow for life as we know it: carbon nitrogen oxygen iron and so on. You have likely heard that you are stardust and it’s true. The iron in your blood the oxygen in your lungs the carbon that is found in all life on Earth—these elements only came to be during the life and death of these celestial phenomena these forces that hang suspended in the sky.

Humanity has always searched the stars for answers whether through navigation prophecy or clues to our wider universe. They are the lights we look up to find our way stories we have drawn in the lines between them. What we are seeing is ourselves our makers. When I feel overwhelmed by my own daily dramas when I am on the verge of collapsing under their gravity I remind myself of this: that I am here because of exploding supernovas. That I can be light when I need to and that I can also be iron. That I am still shaping still expanding. That someday I too will burn out and become part of everything else but burn so brightly before I do.

By combining the power of a cloud-based data ecosystem with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) 3M HIS is transforming physician workflows and laborious “back office” processes to help healthcare organizations streamline clinical documentation and billing enhance security and compliance and redesign the physician-patient experience.

The cloud served as the foundation for this transformation. Migrating its 3MTM 360 EncompassTM System clients to Amazon Web Services (AWS) is helping 3M HIS improve the capture management and analysis of patient information across the continuum of care. 3M 360 Encompass is a collection of applications that work together to help hospitals streamline processes receive accurate reimbursement promote compliance and make data-informed decisions. The cloud-based version of the platform has helped 3M HIS and its clients address three primary challenges: a disjointed patient care journey; the byzantine processes that often inhibit timely and accurate billing reimbursement and other record-keeping; and the ongoing need to protect and properly use patient data.

Improving the patient care journey with data and the cloud

The broader objective of 3M HIS’s evolving cloud transformation strategy is to help caregivers improve patient outcomes and staff efficiencies by removing barriers to care and providing access to contextually relevant insights at the time of care according to Detlef Koll Vice President of Product Development with 3M HIS. Caregivers now work with consistent reliable tools within 3M 360 Encompass that improve communication and reduce the types of errors and delays that cause patient anxiety and revenue cycle inefficiencies.

The journey a patient takes through the healthcare system can span years and touch multiple providers from primary care to specialists test labs medical imaging and pharmacies. During each step multiple types of data are captured in the patient’s medical record which serves as an ongoing “narrative” of the patient’s clinical condition and the care delivered. Physician notes from visits and procedures test results and prescriptions are captured and added to the patient’s chart and reviewed by medical coding specialists who work with tens of thousands of codes used by insurance companies to authorize billing and reimbursement.

A complete compliant structured and timely clinical note created in the electronic health record (EHR) empowers many downstream users and is essential for delivering collaborative care and driving appropriate reimbursement. Supporting physicians with cloud-based speech-enabled documentation workflows 3M HIS further creates time to care by delivering proactive patient-specific and in-workflow clinical insights as the note is being created.

The goal of this automated computer-assisted physician documentation (CAPD) technology is to reduce the cognitive overload on physicians regarding coding requirements while closing gaps in patient care and clinical documentation. Without CAPD closing that loop in real time errors or ambiguities in the clinical note lead to what Koll describes as an “asynchronous” process requiring physicians to review and correct the note on a patient seen days earlier thus taking the physician’s time away from patient care and causing delays in the revenue cycle.

To address the issue 3M HIS needed a way to semantically integrate information from multiple data sources based on the needs of various use cases so it deployed AWS data management tools and services including Amazon RDS Amazon Redshift and Amazon Athena for what Koll calls “opportunistic aggregation of information.” For example for billing coding the platform extracts only the relevant billable elements such as an office visit for which a claim will be submitted. This type of flexible cloud-based data management allows 3M HIS to aggregate different data sets for different purposes ensuring both data integrity and faster processing. “This is a dynamic view on data that evolves over time” said Koll.

Improving workflows through intelligent automated processes

The process for gathering data about a patient’s care then extracting the billable elements to submit to an insurance company for reimbursement has long been handled by professional coders who can accurately tag each medical procedure with the correct code out of tens of thousands of possibilities. Errors in that process can lead to rejected claims and additional time required by caregivers to correct any gaps or inconsistencies in clinical documentation which in turn delays cash flows across the complex network of physicians hospitals labs pharmacies suppliers and insurers.

3M HIS’s cloud transformation strategy addressed this challenge by giving clients access to a new suite of data management and AI/ML tools that deliver levels of processing power functionality and scale unthinkable in the former on-premises model.

“If you had to build some of the capabilities yourself you would probably never get there”

said Michael Dolezal Vice President of 3M Digital Science Community. With AWS tools such as Amazon QuickSight and Amazon SageMaker 3M HIS’s clients can “get there” today: “Now our clients not only have a cloud-based instance for their data but they gain access to tools they never had before and get the ability to do things they otherwise wouldn’t” Dolezal said. By bringing 3M 360 Encompass to the AWS Cloud 3M HIS has been able to scale natural language processing and automation capabilities and leverage tools such as Amazon Textract to improve data input and processing to more efficiently organize a patient’s chart.

Automatic speech recognition to capture the clinical narrative at the point of care along with AWS AI/ML services helps 3M HIS aggregate structure and contextualize data to enable the development of task-specific workflow applications. For instance to mitigate the administrative burden on physicians real-time dictation and transcription workflows can be enhanced with automated closed-loop CAPD whereby a physician dictating an admit note can be “nudged” that a certain condition is not fully specified in the note and can fix the gap in real time.

Taking frontline physician-assistive solutions to the next level embedded virtual assistant technology can automate everyday tasks like placing orders for medications and tests. Innovating incrementally toward smarter and more automated workstreams the 3M HIS ambient clinical documentation solution makes documentation in the EHR a byproduct of the natural patient-physician conversation and not a separate onerous task for the doctor. This frees the physician to focus completely on the patient during the visit thereby transforming the experience of healthcare for all stakeholders.

“We want to reduce the inefficient steps in the old model by unifying and information-enabling workflows so that documentation of the procedure and the coding of that procedure are no longer separate work steps” said Koll. “It has the potential to save hours of time per day for a doctor.”

Enhancing the security of patient data

The security and governance of patient data is non-negotiable in healthcare an industry subject to the most stringent data privacy regulations. Administrators are obligated to make sure patient data is consistently used only for its intended purpose is processed only by the application it was collected for and stored and retained according to the specific national regulations involved. The cloud gives 3M HIS more confidence that the data passing through its platform remains secure throughout its journey.

“Using a cloud-based solution means you can apply the same security practices and protocol monitoring across all of your data in a very consistent way” said Dolezal. The platform ensures a shared responsibility for security across 3M HIS its clients and AWS.

Securing patient data in an on-premises health information system puts the onus to protect that information on the client’s infosec team with risks compounded by each client’s unique IT infrastructure and internal data access policies. Security by design is one of the underlying operating principles for AWS. With a single set of code to monitor maintain and patch 3M HIS is able to keep its platform current quickly respond to new threats and vigorously protect patient data centrally with more certainty that its clients are protected as well.

4 best practices for data-driven transformation

Dolezal and Koll advise anyone considering moving large sets of data to the cloud to follow some fundamental precepts in designing a new solution:

Start with the client and work backward to a solution: Be clear on the problem you want to solve and the outcomes you want to deliver to the caregiver and patient and work backward from there to identify the right technology tools and services to help achieve those goals. Don’t over-engineer the solution: Many IT organizations are moving away from traditional point solutions for collecting storing and analyzing patient information. To reduce complexity enhance security and improve flexibility consider an end-to-end solution that is easier to deploy and update than traditional on-premises solutions and lets organizations add new functionality incrementally. Bake in security from the start: In highly regulated industries such as healthcare and financial services security regulations demand high levels of security and personal privacy protection. These capabilities must be built in as foundational components of any system used to collect manage and analyze that data. Don’t constrain native data: Create a data management strategy that accommodates all types of data and isn’t confined to a specific set of use cases today. With both structured and unstructured data flowing into the system the future ability to analyze the past means having data schema that doesn’t need to be re-architected.

In an intense environment with a relentless focus on cost reduction and improved clinical outcomes in conjunction with greater patient and physician well-being 3M HIS helps clients efficiently capture and access patient data gain meaningful insights from all the data and drive high-value action to meet complex goals.

Pega

Through the Pega Platform and Amazon SageMaker you can easily streamline the development and operationalization of machine learning (ML) models to improve process automation.

Pega is an AWS Partner that provides a low-code platform for delivering artificial intelligence (AI)-powered decision making and workflow automation. Organizations rely on Pega to digitize and transform strategic workflows across onboarding operations and exceptions to improve efficiency increase agility and accelerate outcomes.

Through interoperability with Amazon SageMaker Pega has elevated their Intelligent Automation (IA) offering for AWS customers. Today’s organizations want to go all in with AI—and are getting increasingly more value from it—by inserting AI into all kinds of core business processes and customer interactions in operations services and marketing.

The collaboration between Pega and Amazon Web Services (AWS) allows customers to combine the strengths of cloud data and machine learning with AI-powered decisioning and smart workflow capabilities. This enables customers to operationalize and monetize data and insight drive process efficiency and effectiveness and improve customer experience and value.

A Compelling Value Proposition

According to McKinsey’s institute for business and economic research “about 60% of occupations have at least 30% of their activities automatable.” Most organizations have partially automatable jobs and this means you could spend more time on dynamic work like complex human interactions and creative problem solving—things you’re valued most for.

Intelligent Automation can be applied to a broad range of scenarios—from straight-through processes that can be automated end-to-end to those that involve the orchestration of workflows software robots and human tasks.

According to research conducted by Cognizant and Everest Group 70% of enterprises that manage to harness IA achieved over 50% in return on investment (ROI) and 25% of enterprises achieve over 100% in ROI amounting to tens of millions in USD.

Applications exist across industries to improve process automation in order-to-cash procurement loan origination supply chain optimization customer onboarding and beyond. Pega has successes with customers in many industries—let’s hone in on an example to better understand how to apply Pega to your business processes.

Insurance Claims Processing

The insurance industry is an area where Pega has delivered successes with customers like Healthfirst. As the largest nonprofit health insurer in New York Healthfirst experienced a 15% surge in memberships during the pandemic.

Before this Healthfirst used the Pega Platform to modernize its core administration functions: enrollment claims authorizations payments and provider lifecycle management. Healthfirst’s modern enrollment platform used Pega’s intelligent automation to identify transaction types route work to the right process and automate processes as much as possible.

Pega enabled Healthfirst to scale rapidly throughout the pandemic and allow them to improve their claims processing first pass rate to 92% among many other accomplishments.

Possibilities with ML and Amazon SageMaker

Through Pega’s integration with Amazon SageMaker insurers are able to streamline the development and operationalization of machine learning models to further improve automation.

For instance ML models could be deployed to optimize pricing by predicting the risk of applicants—such as the probability that an applicant will claim a large loss in the future—so that insurance premiums can be assigned more efficiently.

Additionally models could be added to claims processing flows to predict claims that are likely to escalate in complexity and route them to the right adjusters to maximize success rates and minimize re-routing inefficiencies.

Fraud detection models can be added to further improve the ability to surface fraudulent claims. Altogether the addition of ML can improve straight-through processing rates and profitability.

Figure 1 – Attaching a fraud detection model to a case lifecycle workflow on Pega.

Applying Intelligent Automation in Your Business

Here’s a simple discovery framework that Pega prescribes to customers:

Identify candidates: The possible processes you can automate are vast so start by identifying which ones are most critical to your organization. Narrow in on the processes that are automation candidates by surfacing the manual tasks in your current process. You may also consider net-new tasks that aren’t currently feasible—perhaps due to the scale of the required manual labor—but are nonetheless beneficial.

.

As your automation initiatives mature advanced capabilities like Pega’s process mining can be used to analyze existing processes and uncover new opportunities.

. Determine what could be automated: The type of processes best suited for automation can be translated into generalizable and repeatable tasks. For instance a retailer could define an inventory restocking process around a set of rules to decide when to restock and the steps involved in re-ordering stock through supplier’s digital systems. This process involves repeatable logic that can be distilled into an automation workflow.

. Determine what ML can automate: Knowing what part of your process can be automated by machine learning will help you quantify the potential value of your automation. Here are a couple of common patterns:

. Decision points: ML models can often be applied at decision points within workflows. For instance a claims process could use a model to categorize claims that are likely to escalate in complexity and proactively route the work to an appropriately skilled adjuster.

.

A bank meanwhile may use a ML model to generate default risk scores for applicants within a loan origination process to decide on whether to pre-qualify them on a loan. A retailer may use an ML-based forecasting model to improve demand forecasting accuracy and use its projections to decide on when to restock inventory.

.

ML-assisted labor: ML models can automate manual labor associated with data extraction enrichment and analysis of rich media assets. For instance ML enables intelligent document processing (IDP) by translating scanned documents into digital forms and extracting metadata from documents audio and images to help organize information.

.

ML is used to transcribe audio to text and perform language translation. By embedding these capabilities into business processes humans only need to intervene when the models can’t complete the tasks with high confidence.

.

For more complex tasks ML models add value by operating alongside professionals. For instance ML-enhanced search could surface critical information in a large corpus to facilitate a legal investigation. Models could extract terms of interest sentiment and product summaries from text and help legal accelerate e-discovery processes.

.

Additionally conversational AI capabilities like chatbots could be used to solicit missing information from process participants to further streamline workflows.

. Prioritize your use cases: When deciding on which automation to implement first consider the following:

. What’s the cost of the process versus the business value it delivers? Processes that fall in the high-cost and high-value quadrant are likely to deliver high ROI.

Will automating the process allow your team to focus more on high-value and interesting work? Automating tasks in the low-skill and low-interest quadrant can improve employee work satisfaction and improve talent retainment.

What’s the risk of error in your process? Processes that have a high-error rate and high cost of error should be prioritized. Well-designed automation flows and models can deliver consistency by reducing error rates.

Have you thought outside the box? Are there new processes that are now possible with IA technology? These types of processes are likely to deliver a competitive advantage.

Start Your Automation Journey on AWS

If you’re ready to explore IA on AWS follow these steps:

Follow the above discovery framework to identify your top use cases define your business objectives and determine how you will measure success.

. Prepare your supporting IA infrastructure. The architecture for an IA solution that is powered by Pega Cloud and Amazon SageMaker is as follows.

Figure 2 – Reference Architecture for IA powered by Pega Cloud and Amazon SageMaker.

Pega Cloud is a fully-managed service on AWS. If you’re new to Pega Process AI you should take these two courses: Pega Process AI Essentials and Using Machine Learning Services. You can then access Pega Cloud through a free trial.

Pega Cloud can connect to your on-premises resources and your AWS resources through AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) controls you configure in your AWS account. Your ML models will be deployed on Amazon SageMaker from your AWS accounts and your automations in Pega Cloud can provide access to these hosted models using IAM.

Translate your business process into an automation workflow on Pega. Delivering your solution will involve a team consisting of automation engineers that build and manage your automations on the Pega Platform alongside business experts. Eventually your team will also require ML practitioners that will help build and operationalize your ML models on Amazon SageMaker.

.

It’s generally a good idea to build your automation without ML models in your first iteration unless they’re necessary to achieve your most basic business objectives. By doing so you have a way to baseline the performance of your automation get a sense of which models to build first and measure the gains from your models.

.

Furthermore a first version of your automation provides a base for handling cold-start processes. At launch you may not have collected the data required for training effective models. Thus your automation may initially orchestrate manual tasks or rely on subject-matter-expert designed rules. Once you’ve acquired high-quality datasets ML models can be trained to replace manual or sub-optimal steps in your business process.

.

This is an iterative step and you should ensure you’re collecting the right success metrics to help identify and prioritize opportunities to continuously improve your automations.

. Build and deploy your ML models on Amazon SageMaker. Amazon SageMaker is a machine learning service designed to help analysts developers and data scientists build and operationalize ML models. Follow this guide to get started on your journey if you’re new to Amazon SageMaker.

.

Before you start building your models for your Pega automations familiarize yourself with the frameworks and the model input and output formats supported by Pega. Models that are deployed on SageMaker as hosted endpoints can be integrated into your Pega automations through the procedure documentation.

. Build quality control mechanisms for your models. As a best practice you should build mechanisms for:

Human review: The goal of IA is to minimize human intervention but it doesn’t mean you should or could eliminate human involvement. ML models are probabilistic and if your model makes a low-confidence prediction it’s advised to route the decision for human review. Build in logic to your workflow to evaluate confidence thresholds. Start by passing through high-confidence predictions and consider lowering the threshold to improve the pass-through rate if the model proves trustworthy in production.

. Monitoring: ML models generally degrade in performance over time. Models are trained on historic data to discover latent patterns that enable them to accurately predict the future but as environments change the models have to be re-trained to re-adapt. For instance product recommender models have to be re-trained to maintain peak performance as product catalogs and consumer behavior evolve.

.

Amazon SageMaker provides model monitoring capabilities that can help you detect early signs of model degradation. It’s recommended you deploy your models with appropriate monitoring capabilities to ensure your product models continue to meet quality standards.

. Continuous improvement: You should build in mechanisms to continually improve the quality of your models. As part of the human review process you should also build data capture feedback. For instance if your credit risk model in your loan application workflow predicts that an applicant is high-risk but with low confidence your workflow should route the application for expert review and also solicit feedback and capture outcomes—this data can be used to re-train and improve the model.

. Guardrails: You should build in guardrails to ensure your workflows fail gracefully and mitigate the risk of improper use of your models or models that perform unexpectedly poorly in production. For instance if you want to mitigate the risk of change from introducing new models consider running parallel workflows that serve the new challenger models on a subset of your consumer base before promoting the workflow for broader use.

.

This pattern also makes sense for cold-start periods. Initially you may not have the data required to build an effective ML model so you might want to use this design to serve challenger ML models alongside a rules-based model to facilitate cold starts. Alternatively you could manage deployment best practices at the model-level with the help of Amazon SageMaker’s deployment guardrails.

UPDATE: Center Hill High School on Saturday posted the following regarding the outcome of Friday’s school day boys’ basketball game against North Panola and action being taken against the head referee of the game:

Official Update: Yesterday’s basketball game vs NP has been declared a DRAW by Supervising Official for our area. Head Ref from game has been scratched from all future CH games. @desoto_news @DCSeNews — Center Hill High (@TweetDCS_CHHS) November 19 2022

FOLLOWING IS OUR ORIGINAL STORY:

Right now the final score of Friday’s school day basketball game between North Panola at Center Hill reads: North Panola 71 Center Hill 70. But the victory the Cougars thought they were taking back to Sardis may disappear after an appeal of a referee’s apparent error.

With six seconds left in the game and the score 68-67 for the Cougars a North Panola player made two free throws to give the visitors a three-point lead at 70-67.

The Mustangs followed with a three-point basket at the buzzer that appeared to tie the score at 70-70 and overtime loomed.

But it was at that point the scorekeeper for North Panola stepped forward to say the score wasn’t correct that the score should have been 69-67 Cougars before the two made free throws and the game should be 71-67 North Panola with six seconds left before the Center Hill three-pointer.

According to reports the scorebooks were never compared to decide the discrepancy the referees conferred amongst themselves and after their conference decided the score would be 71-70 North Panola the contest was over and the officials exited the gymnasium.

What the officials completely ignored however is a longstanding rule that states the home team scorebook is the official book for a basketball game when a discrepancy is discovered. The officials must defer to the home team’s scorekeeping if an issue develops that can’t be otherwise settled. The rule Rule 2-11 was not applied properly by the officials in this case and it deprived the Mustangs a chance to win the game in overtime.

It is expected that Center Hill will look at game tape and likely file an appeal with the Mississippi High School Activities Association to throw out the North Panola “victory” and declare the game a draw.

Deployments will gradually phase in over the course of the next year.

Tosca operates a pooling model and delivers clean empty pallets from its service centres located across Europe to Avery Dennison sites. The service is fully managed with pallets inspected and washed after every rotation by Tosca.

At the end of every year Avery Dennison and its customers that take part in the pooling program will receive a CO2 emissions reduction certificate.

Tosca predicts that Avery Dennison alone could save 819 tons of CO2 emissions annually by switching all its Euro-sized wooden pallets (1200x800mm) to Tosca.

Violeta Gómez central packaging leader at Avery Dennison said: “The pooling program has been a massive success in Ireland and is helping us to reduce our carbon footprint and eliminate waste within the supply chain. Customers appreciate the fact that plastic pallets offer standard quality: they are cleaner (dust-free) and with less risk of damaging their products.

“Avery Dennison’s and Tosca’s plastic pallet pooling vision doesn’t stop after the pallets arrive to the customer. We encourage customers to take the chance to extend the pooling program further down the supply chain to end-users and help grow the eco system further.”

Felix Van Ouytsel business development manager added: “As the largest pooler of plastic pallets in Europe we deliver a combination of reusable products a flexible global service network and a committed partnership which will benefit Avery Dennison and its customers.”

Chemical company LyondellBasell announced the expansion plans of its propylene production capacity at its Channelview Complex near Houston Texas.

According to the firm the plans include the construction of a new propylene facility using LyondellBasell’s current technology to convert ethylene into propylene to produce polypropylene and propylene oxide.

LyondellBasell anticipates a final investment decision on the 400-kiloton propylene expansion project towards the end of next year.

The project would be able to produce 950 million pounds of goods annually. It would add more than 35% to the company’s propylene capacity at the Channelview Complex and will generate about 10-15 new jobs the firm added.

LyondellBasell Global Olefins & Polyolefins executive vice president Ken Lane said: “In addition to the lower carbon emissions than competing technologies we believe the project has more favourable economics compared to other production methods.

“The products offered through this investment will be an important element to helping our value chain partners achieve their long-term sustainability ambitions.

“Additionally this upstream investment would allow us to be less dependent on propylene market supply and demand providing us with the opportunity to serve growing customer needs better.”

Last month the company and plastic scrap recycler Shakti Plastic Industries signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to form a joint venture to construct a mechanical recycling plant in India.

TACO,"12 years and countless cases of human rights abuse in the making the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 starts on Sunday November 20.

It’s incredible that in just two days the world will stop and celebrate (despite the moral quandaries involved) and very little will get done workwise on a global level for one month.

In the United States however the time difference with host nation Qatar will mean that at least half of the group stage games will be during the twilight hours and early morning. So if you’re not a morning person and you love soccer; well you’re going to suffer a bit during this tournament. Which doesn’t mean Angelenos can’t get in on the party and watch the games in a proper footballing atmosphere.

So if you can wake up in time or manage to slip away from work these are the best places in Los Angeles to take in the matches while enjoying the “world’s game.”

Energy Transition in Oil & Gas – Industry Analysis

The oil & gas industry’s contribution to global warming and its subsequent impact on climate change is well noted in public discourse. There is a growing consensus to transition away from the oil & gas industry for the sake of climate change. This has prompted the industry to limit the impact of its operations. Growing pressure from international bodies such as the UN has prompted oil-producing and consuming nations to switch towards cleaner energy sources.

Energy Transition in Oil & Gas - Value Chain Analysis

The oil & gas value chain is broadly categorized into upstream midstream and downstream sectors. End users also form a prominent vertical that consumes the products produced by the industry. The key energy transition technologies being adopted by the oil & gas industry are CCS hydrogen renewable power energy storage biofuels and electric vehicle charging.

Hydrogen: Hydrogen is a buzzword in the energy sector. Conventionally hydrogen was produced and consumed locally in energy and other heavy industry verticals largely as a chemical. But the use of hydrogen as a fuel is now being explored in the transportation sector as well as in residential heating applications.

Coral South floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) project.



Location

In the deep waters of the Rovuma basin which straddles Mozambique’s northern border with Tanzania about 241 km north-east of Pemba and 48 km from the Mozambique coast.



Project Owner/s

Area 4 is operated by Mozambique Rovuma Venture (MRV) an incorporated joint venture (JV) owned by Eni ExxonMobil and CNPC which holds a 70% interest in the Area 4 exploration and production concession contract.

Eni is the offshore delegated operator and is leading the construction and operation of the FLNG facility on behalf of MRV.

Galp KOGAS and Empresa Nacional de Hidrocarbonetos EP each hold a 10% interest in Area 4.

Project Description

Coral South will be Mozambique’s LNG project and first FLNG facility ever deployed in the deep waters of the African continent.

The project is aimed at developing the southern part of the Coral (nonstraddling) reservoir in the ultradeep waters of Rovuma basin Area 4.

The Coral natural gasfield contains about 450-billion cubic metres of gas. The first phase of the Coral field exploitation includes the development of five-trillion cubic feet of gas.



The project entails the engineering procurement construction installation and commissioning (EPCIC) of an FLNG facility. Coral South FLNG will be the first of its kind in Africa and the third in the world.

The facility will be the first FLNG project for a deep-water gasfield at water depths of 2 000 m or more.



The facility will be 432 m long 66 m wide 38.5 m deep and weigh 220 000 t. It is designed to produce an estimated 3.4-million tons a year of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and 450 000 t/y of gas condensates (ultralight oil).



The FLNG will be a turret-moored double-hull floating vessel on which gas-receiving processing liquefaction and offloading facilities will be mounted together with LNG and condensate storage.

The FLNG is planned to consume 256 kWh/t LNG in the LNG liquefaction process whereas the industry benchmark is typically in the 275 kWh/t to 400 kWh/t of LNG.



Potential Job Creation

The Coral South project will generate significant government income for the country while creating more than 800 new jobs during the operation period.



Capital Expenditure

Total development capital expenditure for upstream and midstream is estimated at $7-billion.



Planned Start/End Date

Coral-South announced a final investment decision in 2017. The construction of the FLNG hull and topside modules started in September 2019. The first LNG produced from the Coral gasfield was shipped from Coral Sul FLNG facility in November 2022.

Latest Developments

bp has successfully loaded the first LNG cargo from the offshore Coral Sul FLNG facility. Under its long-term contract bp will buy 100% of LNG output from Coral Sul FLNG.

bp signed a long-term offtake contract for the buying of LNG for over 20 years in October 2016.

Getty Images.

Last night in Las Vegas a Marine Corps Ball happened at The Paris Casino as our most decorated men and women celebrated the 247th Marine Corps Birthday as many military men and women do around this time.

Generally the soldiers who aren't married do as customary and bring a date. A little background on the event and it's rules per the USMC website:

The Birthday Ball is one of the biggest events on the Marine Corps calendar. It is a chance to get dressed to the nines enjoy an evening of tradition and celebrate the history of the Corps.

It also states to have fun and enjoy yourself. Over the years certain soldiers have had fun by shooting their shot at a celebrities and love interest. We have seen the likes of Kim Kardashian and Justin Timberlake attend various balls around country in years past.

Last night a Marine from Georgia invited someone as well…Infantry soldier of five years Christopher Nesmith whose based in the military in California invited a woman who all of us have seen on occasion MANY TIMES… pornstar and number 1 cougar Richelle Ryan.

Now I can't lie… Richelle has been at the top of my list for years. TRUE TOP OF MY LIST.

Shout out to Chris because he seems to have some good taste in his alone time material as well. According to Richelle the young 22 year old reached out to the luscious lynx by email and according to her was ""very sweet."" She also mentioned ""she had wanted to go to a Ball for forever"".

What a caption…

The biggest question I have was did the hero get it in? Now I am not trying to be disrespectful but it's a fair question.

That said when I texted Richelle she said they did a little boozing and had ""a great time."" We all know that Richelle is a big fan of younger men as evidenced in her appearance on Out and About with Joey and Pat… like and subscribe

Either way… Chris likely has the digits… keep shooting the shots King. A great story on a Feel Good Friday

""When I looked on my mobile app it showed the transactions from where the perpetrators went and took out my money from a bank I didn't even go to"" Martinez told KSBY. ""There were three different transactions — one for $800 one for $700 and one for $60.""

But Martinez was not the only victim. Ang Canseco of Lompoc said that on the same day Martinez had her money stolen while using a Bank of America ATM Canseco used her debit card at a Bank of America ATM in Lompoc.

She says by November 7 her account was wiped out by an unauthorized transaction from Santa Maria's Bank of America location on South Broadway. Canseco adds that on November 13 she also received notice about another transaction in Utah for $380. She says the funds were restored to her account by Thursday evening.

Meanwhile Friday afternoon another Santa Maria Bank of America customer reached out to KSBY saying $800 disappeared from her bank account when she too withdrew money from the ATM on South Broadway on November 7.

Katie Texiera tells KSBY she reached out to the Santa Maria Police Department on November 9. That day according to her police report representatives at the bank informed officers they had recovered a card skimmer inside one of their ATMs and that it was placed in their vault for safekeeping.

On Friday KSBY News reporter Jacob Dizon stopped by the Bank of America on South Broadway to speak with their employees about the incident but they refused to comment on the situation. They directed us to their corporate media spokesperson and we have not yet heard back.

Martinez meanwhile shared about the consequences she has faced as a result of the fraudulent transactions.

""It put me behind on all my bills on all my rent. I had late fees. I wasn't able to get my daughter the shoes she needed for basketball. I had no gas money. It burdened us a lot"" Martinez said.

She says she too filed a police report and that the funds were restored to her account the following week.

Though they are unrelated to this string of incidents at Bank of America on Friday we heard from the Community Bank of Santa Maria for tips on how you can identify and avoid having your card skimmed and duplicated when using ATMs.

They say you should be on the lookout for tape residue or anything sticking out of the ATMs and that it is a good idea to wiggle the card slot or keypad for loose-fitting attachments.

We also reached out to both Santa Maria and Lompoc police departments but they were unavailable for comment.

In the subsequent year and a half the company’s shares have fallen nearly 90%.

Things continue to look bad for the blockchain. Bank of America (BofA) analysts have downgraded Coinbase’s stock citing the “fallout from the FTX collapse.” The bank moved Coinbase shares to “neutral” from “buy” in a Friday note to the bank’s investment clients according to multiple financial outlets. BofA also shifted the stock’s projected target value to $50 down from the $77 the analysts placed it at previously. The platform’s stock sits at just around $45 as of writing and has fallen more than 7.5% today alone.



Coinbase is the second largest crypto exchange by volume after Binance. In the past 24-hours more than $1.2 billion has been traded on the platform. But even with such prominent standing Coinbase isn’t immune from the destabilization brought on by the swift implosion of FTX.

“We do not think COIN is another FTX” wrote BofA senior analyst Jason Kupferberg in the note. But “diminished confidence in the crypto ecosystem” means that the the stock isn’t a sure bet in BofA’s assessment. Kupferberg wrote that “contagion risk” from FTX could lead investors to abandon crypto exchanges and blockchain companies altogether.

Coinbase already wasn’t doing particularly well. And honestly for their own sakes we can only hope BofA’s investment clients cut and run. Crypto has never been a good long-term bet and it sure isn’t now. An estimated three-quarters of all bitcoin buyers lose money “stablecoins” are decidedly not the industry is rife with Ponzi schemes and criminals (and is itself basically just one big pyramid grift) and one of the biggest purveyors of digital coins can go from super bowl ads and celebrity endorsements to disappeared investor dollars in a flash.

What is going on with FTX?

Not too long ago FTX was the third largest cryptocurrency exchange. Its founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was heralded as a new posterchild for the industry—shotgunning to billionaire status basically overnight. But then as you’ve probably heard by now SBF and his hastily assembled crypto empire collapsed over the course of a week after mismanaging investor funds and doing a whole ton of likely illegal things.

FTX’s breakdown has already caused at least one other crypto company to implode: the lender BlockFi—while other blockchain platforms also struggle but deny FTX exposure. Bankman-Fried is facing a class action lawsuit and federal investigations from the DOJ and SEC. There continue to be no signs that investors will recover their funds amid ongoing bankruptcy proceedings and the U.S. is considering extraditing SBF from the Bahamas.

Though there may be a wrench in those plans. On Thursday night the Bahamian government announced that it had seized control of FTX’s remaining assets—adding in another layer of chaos. The mysterious disappearance of the hundreds of millions in FTX funds was previously chalked up as a “hack” but the island country has claimed credit for it stating that “it is not the understanding of the [Bahamian] Commission that FDM is a party to the US Chapter 11 Bankruptcy proceedings.”

The Bahamian and U.S. regulators seem to be sparring over where proceedings surrounding FTX and its liquidation should take place. Though the Bahamas wrote that it would “engage with other regulators and authorities in multiple jurisdictions” to determine the best course of action.

Morgan Stanley scooped three Prime Brokerage awards while there was an all-time high haul for Ultimus which won seven awards across Private Equity Mutual Fund and ETF Administration categories.

T here were also double wins for CSC Citco HSBC Opus Fund Services UMB and BNY Mellon.

The evening recognised the outstanding performers from Global Custodian’s Prime Brokerage Hedge Fund Administration (HFA) Private Equity Administration (PEFA) Mutual Fund Administration (MFA) and Exchange-Traded Fund Administration (ETFA) surveys.

The Prime Brokerage section produced one of the most varied set of winners we’ve seen during this long-tenured event with six different winners. In addition to Morgan Stanley’s aforementioned treble there were wins for Goldman Sachs JonesTrading Lazarus Clear Street and Pershing.

In Private Equity Administration there were honours for SS&C Trident Trust Intertrust and CSC while – outside of the Ultimus scoops – ETFA awards were handed to HSBC State Street and BNY Mellon.

Outside of the survey results outstanding individuals were honoured with personal awards including Jack Seibald of Cowen and Pete Cherecwich of Northern Trust.

It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They’re quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.”

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

Friday’s episode of Raven’s Home welcomed T’Keyah Crystal Keymáh as Raven’s mother Tanya Baxter marking the character’s first on-screen appearance since Season 3 of That’s So Raven back in 2005. (Keymáh left the show midway through its run to care for her grandmother so Tanya was sent off to law school in London.)

More from TVLine

Raven was thrilled to have her mother back on the right side of the pond for the first time in more than a decade but Victor had a slightly more complicated reaction to his estranged wife’s unexpected return. Considering he never even told her about his heart attack it’s fair to wonder how much the long-distance spouses speak to one another. His awkward inability to ask his own wife out to lunch was also troubling.

To make matters worse Raven had a vision of Victor telling Tanya “I can’t live like this anymore.” Traditional shenanigans ensued as Raven’s paranoia led her to crash her parents’ romantic sail boat ride. (“No one dumps my mama not even my daddy!”)

Meanwhile Booker and his associates tracked down the exact tree in which Victor and Tanya once carved their names — the perfect gift for Victor’s 60th birthday — but they fumbled the delivery. More specifically they dropped the stump off the Golden Gate Bridge… and wouldn’t you know it fell directly onto Victor and Tanya’s sailboat.

Raven's Home Tanya Returns

After being rescued by the coast guard and returning home Victor finally told Tanya what Raven had been fearing. But here’s a shocker if you can believe it — Raven misinterpreted her vision! “I just can’t live like this anymore” Victor said. “We’ve been living apart for years. I thought I was fine with that but I saw you today and I realized I’m not.” Instead of ending things with Tanya however Victor announced that he wants to move to London so they can finally be together.

Tanya was elated by this turn of events even more so than Lazlo who claimed Victor’s now-vacant bedroom as soon as he heard about the big move.

But fear not Victor won’t be staying in London for long. Rondell Sheridan is expected back for the sixth season of Raven’s Home which was announced at Disney’s D23 Expo in September.

A biologic therapy that delays the onset of type 1 diabetes received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration on Thursday.

It is the first therapy approved for prevention of type 1 diabetes.

The monoclonal antibody teplizumab which will be marketed under the brand name Tzield from ProventionBio and Sanofi is given through intravenous infusion. The therapy will carry a wholesale cost of roughly $194000 for a full course of treatment the drug’s manufacturer said in an investor call on Friday although this is not expected to be the price consumers would pay.

It is thought to work by turning down the body’s misdirected attack on its own insulin-producing cells. The idea is that protecting these cells buys people more time before they become dependent on insulin to manage their condition.

In clinical trials Tzield delayed progression to full-blown diabetes by a little over two years. But the benefits have lasted much longer in some of the study participants.

One of them Mikayla Olsten was screened for diabetes after her 9-year old sister Mia suddenly developed a life-threatening episode of diabetic ketoacidosis and was diagnosed with diabetes. There was no history of diabetes in the family and Mikayla wasn’t sick but she had four of the five types of autoantibodies that doctors look for to assess a person’s risk.

“They told us when somebody has that many markers it’s not if they’re going to develop diabetes it’s when” said her mom Tracy.

Mikayla was 15 when she joined the study and received teplizumab. She’s now 21 and a senior in college. She gets an annual battery of tests to check her pancreas and blood markers and Tracy Olsten says her condition hasn’t progressed in six years.

According to a scientific statement from JDRF the Endocrine Society and the American Diabetes Association when a person has markers for autoimmune disease and episodes of uncontrolled blood sugar the five-year risk for progression to insulin-dependent symptomatic disease is 75%. The lifetime risk of developing insulin-dependent diabetes is nearly 100%.

So far Mikayla seems to be beating those odds.

Tracy said that for Mia who is dependent on insulin managing her diabetes is a constant chore.

“She has a tremendous amount of juggling that her peers don’t have to do. She has to plan ahead when she has a basketball game or practice on making sure she carbs up and decreases her insulin levels” Tracy said. “She cannot go a minute or a day without thinking about it nonstop and to be able to give Mikayla the opportunity where she doesn’t have to think about it 24/7 is amazing.”

‘Screening becomes a really big issue’

Aaron Kowalski CEO of JDRF says the main challenge in prescribing Tzield will be finding people who need it. The drug is approved for people who don’t have any symptoms of the disease and may not know they’re on the road to getting it.

“Screening becomes a really big issue because what we know is about 85% of type 1 diagnoses today are in families that don’t have a known family history” Kowalski said. “Our goal is to do general population screening” with blood tests to look for markers of the disease.

Tzield is approved for use in people 8 and older who are in stage 2 of their type 1 diabetes. In that stage doctors can measure antibodies that attack insulin-producing beta cells in the person’s blood and they have abnormal blood sugar levels but their body can still make insulin.

“The way in which not just industry but our medical system go about managing autoimmune diseases and especial type 1 diabetes is really suboptimal in today’s day and age” ProventionBio co-founder and CEO Ashleigh Palmer said. “What we do is we wait until the symptoms of the disease present to doctors and then doctors treat the patient’s symptoms chronically for a lifetime. The trouble is that in type 1 diabetes when the symptoms first present it’s too late.”

The treatment comes in a single 14-day course of infusions that each last 30 to 60 minutes.

The most common side effects reported in the trial participants were low white blood cells and lymph cells rash and headache.

The first option for preventing type 1

With type 1 diabetes a person’s immune system attacks cells called beta cells in the pancreas that produce insulin a hormone that helps blood sugar enter cells where it’s used for energy. The attack can happen for years before any symptoms of diabetes appear. Without insulin blood sugar can build up in the bloodstream and break down the body’s own fat and muscle.

Palmer says Tzield holds off the disease before symptoms appear by stopping the autoimmune disease process and the underlying destruction of beta cells. The treatment essentially reboots the immune system preserving beta cell function.

“We really have no preventative measure for type 1 diabetes to date and that is despite [the National Institutes of Health] funding hundreds of millions of dollars over the last 20-plus years of a program called TrialNet that has tested many many different things including this and some of this came out of that work” said Dr. Robert Gabbay chief scientific and medical officer for the American Diabetes Association. “Finally there is something that delays the onset of type 1 diabetes and it’s so exciting.”

Unlike type 2 diabetes which can be prevented with lifestyle changes like losing weight and exercising type 1 is a genetic disease that has not had any prevention options until now.

“For some reason we don’t screen for type 1 diabetes even though there are biomarkers available to show that the autoimmune disease process is already underway” Palmer said. He added that the hopes the drug will catalyze the medical system to start population-based screening during routine childhood well visits in order to intercept the disease and delay its onset.

With Tzield doctors would screen individual family members of people with type 1 diabetes to see whether they have those specific antibodies. If antibody levels are high and it appears that the person is about to develop diabetes the treatment will delay that process.

“If somebody has type 1 a common question that comes up is ‘well what about my child? Are they going to develop type 1?’ It’s only about a 5% risk so more often than not they won’t but if you could find the ones that would and treat them that can make a big difference” Gabbay said.

The potential to help millions

A delayed diagnosis of type 1 diabetes could have a significant impact.

“Obviously the quality of life is substantially impacted negatively impacted if you are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. It’s a disease that never goes away” Palmer said.

People who are type 1 diabetics must monitor their blood glucose levels around the clock affecting how they exercise and eat. High blood sugar can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis in which the body starts to break down fat as its fuel and can cause a buildup of acids called ketones in the bloodstream. That condition can lead to hospitalization coma or death.

As of 2019 about 1.9 million people have type 1 diabetes in the United States according to the American Diabetes Association including 244000 children and adolescents. Type 1 affects 8% of everyone with diabetes.

“The incidence of the type 1 is mainly in kids and teenagers and when you are in the turmoil of adolescence when you just want to forget that you have it” said Olivier Bogillot Sanofi’s head of US general medicines. “So when you have the ability with a treatment to just delay the onset of the disease you can change the way the quality of life is impacted for families and for those kids.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzI1ODkwMDQyMjIwMTU2MzLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CIITA promoter polymorphism impairs monocytes HLA-DR expression in patients with septic shock,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzI1ODkwMDQyMjIwMTU2MzLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E60EDD47F0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzI1ODkwMDQyMjIwMTU2MzLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,,,,

Apple (AAPL 1.00%) is by far the largest investment in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. His 895 million shares mean that 39% of the portfolio's value is in Apple stock.

Although Apple is one of Buffett's biggest winners such a significant position may appear to counter the investment strategy of Buffett and his team which leaned toward more diversification. So it's ironic that this investment has further increased. The question for investors is whether the strategy will work for Buffett and for Apple shareholders looking to follow his lead.

How Berkshire's Apple investment increased

Berkshire's 13F filing following third-quarter 2022 earnings revealed a surprising purchase -- 60 million shares of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM -0.56%). TSMC manufactures chips for the most prominent semiconductor companies including Apple.

According to estimates from Bloomberg and DigiTimes TSMC relied on Apple for more than 25% of its revenue in 2021. This makes Apple TSMC's largest client. That is also a large enough share that TSMC stock could easily rise and fall with the fortunes of Apple.

It also shows how critical TSMC is to Apple. The chips it makes go into critical Apple products such as the iPhone iPad and Mac computers making the chipmaker an indispensable part of Apple's business.

Why this is a wise strategy

The TSMC purchase amounts to ""concentrated diversification."" It benefits Berkshire because it diversifies Buffett's portfolio while exposing itself more deeply to Apple. Since over 25% of TSMC's business involves Apple that means just under 75% does not. Many of TSMC's other clients -- which include Advanced Micro Devices Broadcom Nvidia and Qualcomm -- lead niches within the semiconductor industry.

Moreover Buffett likes market leaders and TSMC fits that description. According to TrendForce TSMC produces slightly more than half of the world's semiconductors. That dominance comes largely from maintaining technical leads over companies like Intel and Samsung. That fact means that its segment-leading clients including Apple will likely continue to turn to TSMC.

Investors will also like that TSMC holds the potential as a profitable stand-alone investment. Its revenue in the first nine months of 2022 of $56 billion grew 43% compared with the same period in 2021. Also its nearly $25 billion in net income left it plenty of cash to invest in the business and pay investors like Buffett more than $7 billion in dividends.

Buffett and his team also bought this stock at a lower valuation than Apple. During Q3 when Berkshire purchased five lots of shares TSMC traded at a P/E ratio ranging from 12 to 18. In comparison Apple sold for between 22 times and 28 times earnings an added factor that may have led to the purchase of TSMC shares.

Should Apple investors follow such a lead?

Investors with significant Apple holdings could further concentrate by adding TSMC shares. At a 14 P/E ratio it remains a cheaper chip stock than Apple and trades near levels where Buffett's company bought TSMC shares.

However investors should not expect this strategy to work most of the time. Even if one can understand a company's suppliers well it is not typical for a related company to offer a low valuation and considerable growth potential.

Nonetheless the TSMC purchase looks like a wise strategy in Buffett's case and shareholders in Apple TSMC and Berkshire Hathaway should profit as a result.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy93YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0dC1zdG9jay1wb3J0Zm9saW8tMTAtMTgzNjIwNDA0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warren Buffett's Stock Portfolio and 10 Newest Investments in 2022,"In this article we discuss Warren Buffett’s 10 newest investments in 2022.

On November 15 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) shares climbed more than 12% to $81.62 in mid-day trading as Buffett disclosed his stake while other chip makers also rose including Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Marvell Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL). These firms are also TSMC’s customers.

In recent years Warren Buffett has been willing to invest in technology with the Berkshire portfolio featuring notable stocks like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ). Jim Shanahan an analyst at Edward Jones noted that tech and communications businesses now represent approximately half of Berkshire’s portfolio which he said provides a good balance as the firm’s “portfolio companies are more old economy”.

Here is what GoodHaven Capital Management specifically said about Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF) in its second-quarter 2022 investor letter:

“Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF) was our next biggest dollar detractor and had also been a strong contributor in prior periods. As we have previously mentioned while Jefferies has become a better business it is still a cyclical business and that some moderating earnings after the recent boom were to be expected. In the first six months of their fiscal 2022 Jefferies earned a ROATE (Return on Adjusted Tangible Equity) of over 11% reasonable given the very material slowdown in the capital markets lately. They also repurchased over $620 million of their shares at $34+ per share and Jefferies’ stock now trades below tangible book value/share. Given the obvious slowdown in capital raising transactions industry wide we expect continued muted results in the near-term but also continued share buybacks. Our long-term enthusiasm remains as does our view of the material upside for the shares from recent levels.”

9. Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (NYSE:LPX)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28

Here is what L1 Capital International specifically said about Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (NYSE:LPX) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:

“We have invested in Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (NYSE:LPX) due to its Smartside siding business. Smartside has consistently increased its share of the siding market in the U.S. not just new residential construction but repair and renovation shed and other markets. Louisiana Pacific has not been able to keep up with demand for Smartside and is sold out to the end of 2022. New capacity is being added currently which will support future growth. Between 2015 to 2022 Smartside EBITDA increased from around US$100 million to a run-rate approaching US$400 million. We believe Smartside has many years of strongly profitable growth to come (see Figure 12). Imagine being offered to buy a business. This business is breakeven in a down year makes an operating profit of a few hundred million dollars in a normal year and in an exceptional period in 2021 made around US$1.5 billion profit. The person offers to sell you the business for nothing. This is the current investment opportunity for Louisiana Pacific. In addition to owning Smartside it also owns the second largest oriented strand board business in North America and a successful woods product business in South America. The price of OSB is exceptionally volatile but has recently delivered super-normal profits to Louisiana Pacific enabling management to buy back 45% of shares on issue while maintaining net cash. At Louisiana Pacific’s current share price we are paying the bottom end of fair value for Smartside and getting the OSB business practically for nothing.”

8. RH (NYSE:RH)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48

Berkshire Hathaway’s Stake Value: $580724000

RH (NYSE:RH) is a California-based retailer of home furnishings providing furniture lighting textiles bathware and home decor. In Q3 2022 Warren Buffett strengthened his hold on RH (NYSE:RH) by 9%. The hedge fund had 2.36 million shares of RH (NYSE:RH) worth $580.7 million at the end of September representing 0.19% of the total 13F securities. Buffett has held a position in RH (NYSE:RH) since the third quarter of 2019.

On November 18 Wedbush analyst Seth Basham downgraded RH (NYSE:RH) to Neutral from Outperform but trimmed the price target to $270 from $274. RH (NYSE:RH) has been successful in safeguarding its brand without discounting but this has contributed to higher market share losses the analyst wrote in a research note. He sees increasing evidence of a course-correction to its strategy of ""climbing the luxury mountain."" The analyst however ""surprisingly found"" that RH (NYSE:RH) slashed prices by 2%-9% since March on half of the products. This ""potential course-correction"" in the company's strategy and the worsening macro outlook led to the downgrade.

Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey 48 funds were long RH (NYSE:RH) at the end of Q3 2022 compared to 59 funds in the earlier quarter. Stephen Mandel’s Lone Pine Capital held a notable stake in the company comprising 1.7 million shares worth $436.2 million.

Here is what GreenWood Investors specifically said about RH (NYSE:RH) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:

“Gary Friedman the owner manager of RH (NYSE:RH) has been talking about the company climbing the luxury mountain over the past few years. Wall Street is skeptical RH can hold its leading margin profile after elevated demand during Covid and it surely doubts that it is a luxury company at 10x earnings. We’ve been looking to get involved in the housing ecosystem given the dramatic selloff in the sector over the past year and our first investment here is via RH. Demographically we expect US household formation to remain very strong after a decade of underinvestment in housing supply. Gary strategically with-held new product launches in the aftermath of Covid when times were easiest and is now releasing a new premium product lineup. We believe there is a lot of latent pricing power in home furnishing and while high interest rates are trapping people in a home they would otherwise possibly leave we believe the consumer particularly the high-end consumer will look to continue to upgrade their homes. The truest test of Gary’s quest to make RH a true luxury company is in fact a recession. One of the reasons why there are few if any American luxury businesses is that without a family controlling the company optimizer-oriented management teams cannot withstand the pain that comes from not discounting a product line into weak demand. We can’t recall a single American company that has “destroyed” inventory like the French luxury companies in the face of a recession. Many have tried. Few if any have succeeded. Anchored by Gary’s 21% ownership of the company RH has a good chance. And not only is it not tempted in the current volatile environment to discount but he is actually raising prices. With a buyback authorized for over 30% of the shares outstanding Friedman is also not shying away from making bold investments in the current environment. He is aggressively expanding galleries and introducing new marquee European properties. The combined product launch cadence increased prices aggressive footprint investments and forthcoming share repurchases not to mention low valuation made us move off the sidelines and take a position in RH. While we are certainly not hoping for a recession we are excited that such an environment could solidify Gary’s mission to make RH a rare American luxury brand.”

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42

According to Insider Monkey’s data 42 hedge funds were bullish on Ally Financial Inc. (NYSE:ALLY) at the end of September 2022 and Harris Associates held a significant stake comprising 26.7 million shares worth $745.7 million.

Here is what Moon Capital Management specifically said about Ally Financial Inc. (NYSE:ALLY) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:

“We recently purchased shares of Ally Financial Inc. (NYSE:ALLY) the world’s largest digital-only bank. Ally’s legacy dates back more than 100 years when it was originally launched as GMAC the in-house financing arm of General Motors. The company was spun out from GM and rebranded as Ally more than a decade ago but has retained an automotive focus on the lending side where it holds the largest position in prime auto lending. Since the spinoff Ally has transformed from an auto loan company into a comprehensive independent finance provider for borrowers and savers of all types. The company has completely restructured the liability side of its balance sheet and has created a deposit-gathering engine that is now more than 85 percent deposit[1]funded. (Compared to issuing traditional corporate debt deposits are a significantly less expensive capital source for banks.) Due to the lower overhead associated with the digital bank’s lack of brick-and-mortar locations the bank produces one of the best efficiency ratios in the industry. This low-cost position combined with a relatively high loan portfolio yield of approximately 6.75 percent has helped the company earn net interest margins well above those of many leading banks. These high margins translate into high returns on equity which the company targets at 16-18 percent over the medium term. (Actual ROE in 2021 was 24 percent. When the company came public in 2014 its ROE was a paltry four percent.)..” (Click here to read the full text)

Warren Buffett boosted his Celanese Corporation (NYSE:CE) stake by 7% in Q3 2022 holding 9.71 million shares worth $877.2 million representing 0.29% of the total securities.

In addition to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) Celanese Corporation (NYSE:CE) is one of the top picks of Warren Buffett.

Here is what Vltava Fund has to say about Celanese Corporation (NYSE:CE) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:

“We then used the money freed up to among other things open three new positions. The stock price declines during the Russian invasion brought a lot of good prices to the market. Out of all the possibilities we considered we picked the stocks of Celanese (CE). Celanese is the world’s largest producer of acetic acid and its chemical derivatives including vinyl acetate monomers and emulsions. Their applications are used in a wide range of industries such as automotive tobacco coatings construction energy telecommunications food and medical. Celanese recently closed the acquisition of a large part of DuPont’s business which will make Celanese an even bigger player in the industry while reducing the cyclicality of it business. The acquisition is quite large and should deliver significant value to shareholders that in our view is not at all presently reflected in the share price. Celanese is a business that stands more or less aside from the main interests of most investors but it is a company with very high returns on capital strong free cash flow and historically very efficient resource allocation.”

Not sure which espresso machine to buy? Or the difference between a Sony and a Canon camera lens?

If you are buying online Best Buy's ""virtual store"" in Bloomington is set up to help.

Located in 40000 square feet of space of one of the electronics retailer's Bloomington warehouses not far from its Richfield headquarters the store is more like a Hollywood set. It is the company's first foray into a new type of interactive digital shopping experience that its leaders say is the next step in retail's evolution.

One area is a gym staffed with personal trainers and equipment. Another is dedicated to Microsoft laptops and devices. In the large photo section professional photographers explain details of cameras and lenses through equipment that allows the consumer to see through the camera lens. There are also cubicles for staff to have more private conversations with customers as well.

Ring lights movable cameras and computers are everywhere to help staff demonstrate the products.

""This is kind of the first step into the metaverse where you actually have this virtual team"" said Damien Harmon Best Buy's executive vice president of omnichannel. ""We are spending a lot of time and saying 'What does that experience look like? How should we think about this? What's the next evolution?'""

The online expert service launched last winter as people were still worried about venturing into physical stores and continued to grow even as brick-and-mortar shopping made its comeback. Best Buy leaders say the company continues to explore the potential for other uses.

Over the pandemic consumers have become more willing to engage in different types of shopping experiences said Ben Arnold a consumer electronics industry analyst for market research company the NPD Group.

""I think that this type of service or storefront is something that gets at consumers wherever they might be wherever their eyeballs might be and capitalizes on that convenience aspect"" Arnold said. ""But it's also something I think shoppers expect from Best Buy. ... I think in a lot of ways it's on trend for where retail is going.""

Some newer areas in Best Buy's space include scooters and electric bikes a Therabody station with leg compressors and a place that will be set up for Best Buy's new over-the-counter hearing aids.

""All we wanted to do is put the expertise that Best Buy is known for ... and put them online"" said Adam Born Best Buy's vice president of category and virtual sales enablement during a tour of the warehouse space.

Customers are directed to the virtual store by going to a BestBuy.com product page and clicking on the icon of a blue-shirted Best Buy employee in the bottom right corner.

Virtual store staff can text chat talk over the phone video chat and screenshare with customers. The experience is likely a step up for many consumers' online interactions with retailers Born said.

""Customers almost always assume they are talking to a chatbot"" he said. ""The more human we make these interactions the better they will get.""

There are 120 Best Buy employees who work in the virtual store. There are about 200 other people who work remotely offering help. A few dozen vendor representatives also give demonstrations for their products.

There also are satellite virtual stores staged in physical stores a home theater set up in Illinois and an appliance center in California.

Over the past year the virtual store has served more than a quarter million customers. The company said it is seeing a 20% customer satisfaction improvement from before the virtual store.

Best Buy has continued to grow its virtual sales throughout the pandemic. So far this fiscal year the company has generated five times the digital sales as it did in the fiscal year that incorporated most of 2019.

Harmon said Best Buy will continue to experiment with how to use the virtual store. Best Buy is already partnering with some vendors to make virtual store help available from their product websites. Harmon said the space can also be used to remotely train employees on new products.

The virtual store is only one avenue that Best Buy is experimenting with to figure out the next evolution of its retail stores. This summer the retailer opened a small-format store in North Carolina that customers use their smartphones to shop. It is also testing outlet stores and experiential stores which provide more interaction.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vZGVhbHMvYmxhY2stZnJpZGF5LXR2LWRlYWxzLWFyZS1saXZlLWF0LWJlc3QtYnV5LWhlcmUtYXJlLXRoZS0xMy1iZXN0LW9mZmVycy1zby1mYXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Black Friday TV deals are live at Best Buy - here are the 13 best offers so far,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.techradar.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /deals/black-friday-tv-deals-are-live-at-best-buy-here-are-the-13-best-offers-so-far (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E61019E7A0>, 'Connection to www.techradar.com timed out.

Mint Mobile seems to be part of the latter group bringing eSIMs for purchase to Best Buy and Target.

On paper eSIMs are very easy to download and activate. All it takes is a direct link to a service provider like Mint Mobile’s eSIM download page and you can install the virtual network card to your device’s eSIM slot. Generally speaking switching to an eSIM works best when purchasing a new plan. Once you switch you can ditch the old physical card and leave that open for an international or business SIM slot so long as your phone has physical slots available.

Mint Mobile is making it even easier to get an eSIM by teaming up with Target and Best Buy to bring store purchases to customers. Now users will be able to scan a QR code and sign up for Mint Mobile which will then allow them to download an eSIM and get on the network immediately.

With that Mint Mobile is running a deal at participating stores wherein if you sign up for three months worth of service you can get an additional three for free. You’ll still be able to purchase physical SIMs from these retailers if you still want to sign up. It doesn’t look like this deal is live online making it a potential in-store-only deal.

This is a huge step for those looking to switch to a network like Mint Mobile on an eSIM since all it will take is an easy QR code at either major retailer to get started. You’ll want to ensure your Android device can handle an eSIM from Mint first as some aren’t supported yet.

Johannes Faul a director at Morningstar had a fair value estimate of AU$26.50 on WOW stock and pointed out first quarter group sales increased by 2%.

“However sales performance differed significantly across Woolworths’ three businesses segments: Australian food; New Zealand food; and discount department store Big W” he said.

While supermarket sales benefited from Covid-19 restrictions on both sides of the Tasman Sea in the previous corresponding period Big W’s sales were negatively affected. Faul added:

“The September quarter 2022 saw a reversal in sales performance. Sales in the core Australian food business fell 1% with Woolworths losing market share to rival Coles which grew its supermarket sales by 2% as shopping preferences normalised.”

The bottom line

Remember that information on a company’s stock ownership structure may be important in terms of forming an idea of the firm’s performance but it shouldn’t be used in place of your own research.



You should always conduct your own due diligence before trading looking at the latest news a wide range of commentary as well as technical and fundamental analysis.

Past performance does not guarantee future returns. And never trade money you cannot afford to lose.

In its efforts to accelerate progress towards a sustainable aviation system NASA is not only working to design the ultra-efficient aircraft of the future but also to advance the use of alternative fuels in today’s planes.

The team at Boeing’s Everett Delivery Center was working with the company’s 2022 ecoDemonstrator aircraft a 777-200ER wide-body passenger jet frame converted into a flying testbed. It was the second year in a row that Boeing and NASA worked together on this type of test. A key difference? Last time the ecoDemonstrator aircraft was powered by a low-emitting LEAP-1B engine that first entered into service in 2017. Testing on this year’s Boeing ecoDemonstrator involved an aircraft with Rolls-Royce Trent 800 engines that have been in service since 1996.

Sustainable aviation fuel is intended to deliver performance but with a smaller carbon footprint. It is often blended with traditional jet fuel but Boeing ecoDemonstrator partners are working to generate the data needed to enable widespread use of 100% sustainable aviation fuel and assess its impact on particulate emissions. Tests on multiple kinds of engines can bring us closer to that goal.

“Testing all of these various engine technologies helps increase our understanding on how sustainable aviation fuel can have positive impacts on air quality when engines are idling at airports and on the climate-warming potential of contrails in the atmosphere” said Richard Moore atmospheric scientist at NASA’s Langley Research Center in Virginia.

Researchers had access to specialized capabilities thanks to the presence of Langley’s Mobile Lab which was protected from the 777-200ER’s powerful exhaust by a blast deflector. The Lab’s comprehensive suite of instrumentation analyzed not only the gaseous emissions but also particulates – soot and other aerosols – by using a custom-built probe designed to interface with the deflector behind the airplane.

The researchers are also incorporating lessons learned from last year’s tests related to fuel handling. After sustainable fuel leaves the refinery researchers must ensure that there’s no jet fuel contamination occurring as the fuel gets transferred throughout the national logistics system.

“This is important because we’re starting to realize that even tiny concentrations of sulfur or aromatic chemical compounds in the fuel may be impactful for emissions” said Moore.

Although the teams are still analyzing their results they say the knowledge they’ve gained is already expanding the knowledge needed to make sustainable aviation fuel adoption possible across current aviation fleets.

“It was exciting to further this research” said Moore “Studying how the combination of advanced aircraft engines and sustainable aviation fuels reduces the emissions of climate-altering particles will help NASA and industry work towards reaching the global goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpcmdpbmlhYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvYm9laW5nLWRlZmVuc2UtdW5pdC1hbm5vdW5jZXMtbGVhZGVyc2hpcC1zaGlmdHMtcmVvcmdhbml6YXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boeing defense unit announces leadership shifts reorganization,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.virginiabusiness.com/article/boeing-defense-unit-announces-leadership-shifts-reorganization/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpcmdpbmlhYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvYm9laW5nLWRlZmVuc2UtdW5pdC1hbm5vdW5jZXMtbGVhZGVyc2hpcC1zaGlmdHMtcmVvcmdhbml6YXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS90cmFuc3BvcnRhdGlvbi8yMDIyLzExLzE4L2JvZWluZy1tYXgtanVzdGljZS1kZXBhcnRtZW50L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Families of Boeing Max victims disappointed by Justice Dept. meeting,"Families of those killed on two Boeing 737 Max planes met with Justice Department officials Friday an early result of a federal judge’s ruling last month that the department violated a federal law meant to protect crime victims.

Discovery.

As We Got This Covered previously reported a news article surfaced citing anonymous insiders that no set plans are currently in place for the Henry Cavill Superman follow-up film but the search may still be on for a writer and director. However the article said the overall plan for the DC Universe is currently being fine-tuned by Gunn and Safran. As The Wrap explained

“No one knows what the long range plan is except for Gunn and Safran who have been at their new posts for less than three weeks. However according to the insider Gunn and Safran’s long range plan should be revealed in the next two months.”

Now Gunn is confirming at least one aspect of The Wrap article. As one fan asked him on Twitter

“@TheWrap just reported you and Safran are planning to reveal the new DC plans in the next 2 months is that true?”

@TheWrap just reported you and Safran are planning to reveal the new DC plans in the next 2 months is that true? — The Flick Pec (@gimitko) November 18 2022

Gunn replied: “Yes that is true (revealing it to the wbd team).”

Yes that is true (revealing it to the wbd team) — James Gunn (@JamesGunn) November 18 2022

Gunn’s response seems to indicate he and Safran’s pitch to WBD about the rollout of the DCU would be an internal unveiling rather than a public road map like we’ve seen with Marvel’s Phases. However maybe a road map-type reveal could be in store for DC at next year’s San Diego Comic-Con.

What’s even more interesting than Gunn’s response about the future DC is the underlying implication that he has seemingly lent credibility to the anonymous insider sources in The Wrap article. Could this mean a sequel to Man of Steel is truly way more in the distance than fans initially hoped as the article implies? Only time will tell.

BEST BET

JABBAWOCKEEZ (Race 3 No. 6 – $2.60)

Jabbaawockeez had a good run before he was narrowly beaten on debut. He'll be better for that experience and but won't have to improve much to break through on Sunday.

NEXT BEST

CALLIGRAPHER (Race 7 No. 6 – $5.50)

Never Again just missed when up to 2000m in the Ararat Cup and beat home a subsequent city winner so the form is good. He'll go close again in the Penshurst Cup.

VALUE BET

SAVVY ACQUISITION (Race 5 No. 5 – $9.50)

Savvy Acquisition did a good job when not far away over this course last time. There's not much depth to this race and he races well on his home track.

That’s a big statement coming a week after Eli Lilly lost around $15 billion from its market cap after a fake account tweeted out that “insulin was free now.” The saga forced Lilly to apologize and according to reports from The Washington Post pull back ads from the platform and pause its comms strategy.

The fake account took advantage of the Twitter Blue subscription service an idea from new owner Elon Musk that charges people $8 a month to have the blue tick on their account. The checkmark used to mean the account had been verified and authenticated. Under the new service though the supposed verification badge could be bought by anyone.

The fake Lilly account had that tick leading it to garner thousands of views and likes as it looked like the real thing.

But ZoomRx's quick-fire report shows that while what happened to Lilly may have irked pharma doctors—a core target on Twitter for the industry—are not leaving and therefore neither should they.

ZoomRx tapped its social media scraping artificial intelligence tool to look at the impact of the Lilly/Twitter debacle on physicians' attitude and usage of Twitter. The firm found that 75% of physicians—via a sample size of 566 doctors—who were active during oncology conferences continued to post on Twitter over the past week.

“Despite the frustration with Elon Musk it seems physicians aren’t quitting” the report shared with Fierce Pharma Marketing found.

Looking through examples of some leading doctors on the site found that “despite expressing frustration physicians—especially digital opinion leaders—have decided to stay because Twitter has become essential to help patients advance science and fight misinformation.”

ZoomRx's advice? “Pharma firms that manage to maintain positive relations with the #MedTwitter community even during this chaos would end up increasing their brand equity.”

There was similar advice from the FDA Commissioner Robert Califf M.D. who earlier this month—and before the Lilly fiasco—implored users to not “abandon Twitter” and that he “believes in the power of social media being used for good.”

Twitter Blue is currently paused while Musk plans the launch a new version of the paid service targeted for the end of the month.
