Hershey president and CEO Michele Buck presenting third-quarter results on Friday (4 November) said that despite the multitude of pressures on household budgets people are prioritising snacks as an indulgent treat in these tough economic times.

However the Reese’s buttercups and Dot’s pretzels maker is eyeing when consumers might reach “breaking point” as CFO Steve Voskuil said third-quarter volume increases were representative of “resilient price elasticities.”

“We continue to expect pricing to be a large contributor to net sales growth and help offset high single-digit cost inflation across commodities packaging logistics wages and other general operating expenses” Voskuil said in his prepared remarks.

“While we expect the operating environment to remain dynamic into 2023 we also expect to enter next year with strong momentum and believe we are positioned to deliver a year of strong top- and bottom-line growth.”

Voskuil anticipates some moderation in input-cost inflation into next year but the high single-digit outlook remains.

Asked during the Q&A session to quantify where the “pain points” for Hershey are amid the general perception that inflation will ease in 2023 he said input-cost pressures are not expected to be “as high as this year”.

Voskuil explained: “On the commodity side we still have some commodity pressure in some commodities where we don’t have complete hedging coverage. Packaging costs logistics still seeing inflation in people costs some energy costs and I would also say technology is probably another one that’s starting to be a bigger component. Across that basket we’re still seeing high single-digit inflation.

“I would hope by the time we get to the back half of next year you’re again starting to see more moderation as we start to lap more of those inflationary costs but [we’re] still expecting a pretty significant lift next year.”

Buck outlined a “reprioritisation” of how consumers are spending in the current environment particularly around “value channels and value packs”.

She added: “Within our categories the trends have really remained very strong as the consumer continues to prioritise snacking and particularly sweet treats and obviously we have minimal private-label presence. So we continue to see that our products remain an affordable treat for families and for consumers. We know part of that is they want to reward themselves when times are tough.”

Buck emphasised an awareness about the “pressures” currently on consumers and the pick-up in demand for private label outside of the categories in which Hershey plays.

“I would say overall we need to continue to be always focused on the consumer and when they could hit a breaking point but to date as we look at our elasticities we really aren’t seeing signs of that impacting our business” she explained.

“That said we’re going to be very focused on it going forward because we don’t want to miss a trend. I would say historically our category has tended to fare pretty well during these times because it is an affordable indulgence when consumers can’t afford a lot of other things.”

With the third-quarter results beating Hershey’s own expectations the company raised its forecasts for annual sales and earnings per share.

Top-line growth is now envisaged at 14-15% versus a prior estimate of 12-14%. EPS growth is expected at 11-13% from 9-12% and adjusted EPS at 14-15% as opposed to 12-14%.

Hershey did issued a note of caution on margins. Adjusted gross margin which declined 180 basis points in the quarter to 42.5% is likely to be down 120 points over the year as a whole.

“As expected broad-based supply-chain inflation labour investment higher supply-chain costs to support sustained consumer demand and unfavourable mix continued to pressure margin partially offset by net price realisation and volume growth” Voskuil said.

“While our gross margins continue to lag prior-year levels we are pleased with the improvement in trends and expect the sequential improvement to continue into Q4.”

Henrik Rybinski scored his first AHL goal in Hershey’s road victory over the Wilkes Barre/Scranton Penguins on Sunday.

The Florida Panthers’ 2019 fifth-round draft pick turned Capitals prospect wearing jersey number 38 potted a rebound that came out into the slot from an Aaron Ness rush attempt to give the Bears a 4-0 lead.

The 21-year-old forward was all smiles as he went to the Bears’ bench to celebrate. Henrik Borgstrom grabbed the milestone puck from the Baby Pens’ net.

After the game Rybinski took a picture with that goal puck.

The rookie Rybinski has gotten into five games this season for the Bears after five years spent in the WHL with junior teams the Medicine Hat Tigers and Seattle Thunderbirds.

In Sunday’s game he skated on Hershey’s second line with Borgstrom and the returning Garrett Pilon.

The Capitals signed the Vancouver native to a three-year entry-level contract last March after the six-foot-two 185-pound center entered free agency when Florida declined to retain his rights.

JD Burke of EPRinkside had Rybinski as the number one CHL free agent in last year’s cycle and “by a decent margin at that”.

Rybinski tallied 65 points in 47 games in the WHL last season – good for 41st in total league scoring – and finished thirteenth in points per game (1.38).

“The CHIPS Act gives us an opportunity to look at ways we can bring back some of the investments we’ve made overseas and bring those back to Corvallis” Tuan Tran HP’s president of imaging and printing said at an event last month at the company’s campus there.

HP wants to bring its development prototyping and manufacturing back under one roof Tran said if it can capture a share of the $52 billion the Commerce Department plans to begin allocating early next year.

“Thanks to that we will be able to continue to invest expand our capabilities here” said CEO Enrique Lores who also attended the event.

Some Oregon economic development officials are pessimistic that the state will land a meaningful share of CHIPS Act funding lamenting that Oregon hadn’t positioned itself soon enough to capitalize on the opportunity.

But U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden who attended the Corvallis event hailed HP’s plans as a symbol of Oregon’s opportunity and said he’s confident the state’s manufacturers can land significant funding if lawmakers move quickly on proposals to improve Oregon’s competitive position.

“Oregonians want their elected officials to get this done today. Don’t wait until 2023” Wyden said in an interview Friday.

Gov. Kate Brown is readying a legislative package for lawmakers to consider on “day one” of their next session which begins in late January. Proposals focus on increasing available industrial land boosting tax incentives streamlining environmental regulations and adding worker training.

Microchip Technology is contemplating a second factory at its Gresham site. The project would cost $3 billion to $5 billion and add several hundred jobs but the company hasn’t decided whether to build in Oregon or somewhere else in the U.S.

Microchip CEO Ganesh Moorthy told Wall Street analysts last week that “The availability of grants subsidies and other incentives will all be important considerations in our analysis and will also help determine the location and timing for the fab.”

Late last month Wyden met with Moorthy and Microchip employees at the Gresham site and the senator said they discussed the expansion plans.

“I left very encouraged by the meeting” Wyden said.

Legions of electronics manufacturers are positioning themselves for a share of the CHIPS Act money and even at $52 billion it’s clear that demand for the federal subsidies will handily outpace supply. So it’s hard to gauge how HP or any other company will fare in its pursuit of funds.

HP declined to elaborate on how many jobs it might add in Corvallis and didn’t say how much it’s seeking in federal support. It doesn’t appear the company is contemplating a new Oregon factory like Microchip.

Still restoring some work to Corvallis would be a significant reversal for HP after years of cuts. (HP is also planning to move its Vancouver operations to a new campus in 2026. That decision predates the CHIPS Act.)

HP invented its inkjet printer in Corvallis and the site remains one of the Silicon Valley company’s leading research sites. But HP has steadily reduced its manufacturing footprint there over many years both due to declines in its printer business and because it has shifted more production to Asia.

As recently as this fall HP had been furloughing workers in its Corvallis printer supply factor amid falling demand.

Now though it appears HP envisions the federal money as an opportunity to reinvigorate its Oregon operations.

“HP Corvallis is home to some of the most cutting-edge MEMS (Micro Electrical Mechanical Systems) and Microfluidics R&D and manufacturing in the world” the company said in a written statement. “It’s a hub of innovation for HP and we are committed to investing in our future.”

Trimble and HP Collaborate to Explore the Use of Robotic Technology for Autonomous Indoor Construction Layout

The construction industry faces a variety of challenges including the shortage of skilled workers and productivity. HP and Trimble can address these challenges with an integration of HP SitePrint and the recently introduced Trimble® Ri total station. The integrated solution can deliver an autonomous layout workflow that empowers efficiency and productivity on the job while delivering layouts faster than traditional methods. Augmenting the contractors' work SitePrint can avoid obstacles and print lines and complex objects with pinpoint accuracy and consistent repeatability.

Using optical technology the precise positioning and navigation of HP SitePrint robot is driven by the Trimble Ri total station. Equipped with automatic level detection self-calibration and Trimble VISION™ technology for advanced tracking the Trimble Ri enables the HP SitePrint robot to achieve autonomous high-accuracy indoor layout work.

""The integration of Trimble Ri and HP SitePrint can transform the layout process on complex construction sites with pinpoint accuracy and in a fraction of the time"" said Aviad Almagor vice president of Technology Innovation Trimble. ""This is an opportunity for layout contractors to improve accuracy and productivity and handle more projects with the same size of team.""

""Technology adoption and increased digitization can help construction firms bridge this productivity gap"" said Daniel Martínez vice president and general manager HP Large Format Printing. ""HP has played a key role in bridging digital and physical worlds with print solutions for architects and engineers over the last thirty years. With the integration between HP SitePrint and Trimble Ri we can make it easier than ever for layout professionals to bring an idea to life on site while also enabling increased digitization of the construction industry as a whole.""

Workers voted 165 to 51 against forming Home Depot Workers United which would have represented 274 employees at the store according to the National Labor Relations Board which oversaw the voting. The company and union organizations have five days to file objections.

The defeat for the organizers could discourage activist workers who have successfully formed the first unions at big chains including Amazon Starbucks Trader Joe’s and Apple but have since suffered setbacks in getting collective bargaining off the ground or organizing more unions.

The Atlanta-based company employs about 500000 people at its 2316 stores in the U.S. Canada and Mexico.

Vincent Quiles the Home Depot employee leading the unionization effort told WHYY-FM that the attempt to organize workers had been a “tall order.”

“It wouldn’t be an easy fight to have” Quiles said. “But you do these things because you believe them to be right.”

Home Depot workers at a store in Philadelphia have rejected an attempt at unionization. AP

Quiles previously said discontent with compensation working conditions understaffing and lack of training are among the grievances that spurred the effort to organize.

After the failed union vote Home Depot spokesperson Margaret Smith told WHYY “We’re happy that the associates at this store voted to continue working directly with the company. That connection is important to our culture and we will continue listening to our associates and making The Home Depot a great place to work and grow.”

Quiles has filed a complaint of unfair labor practices with the NRLB alleging managers engaged in inappropriate surveillance and interrogation tactics against union supporters. Quiles has said managers followed him around the stores and tried to disrupt any conversations he tried to have with co-workers even if it wasn’t about the union.

Instead Quiles said he relied on TikTok videos group text messaging and e-mailing to campaign for the union.

Home Depot has denied the complaint’s allegations.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL2NvcnBvcmF0ZS5ob21lZGVwb3QuY29tL25ld3MvcHJvZHVjdHMvd2FudC1zdGFydC1kZWNvcmF0aW5nLWhvbGlkYXlzLXlvdXJlLW5vdC1hbG9uZS1nZXQtaG9saWRheS1tYWdpYy1zdGFydGVkLWVhcmx5LWhvbWXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Want to Start Decorating for the Holidays?

Emerson on October 31 announced plans to sell a majority stake in its Climate Technologies business — the entire HVACR-related portfolio of services and products including the Copeland compressor brand — to the private equity firm Blackstone. The deal to be finalized in the coming months will spin off Climate Technologies as a joint venture with Emerson to have a non-controlling 45% stake in the new company until a possible sale or initial public offering.

The agreement values Emerson’s Climate Technologies business at $14 billion and will give Emerson a pre-tax payment up front of about $9.5 billion. A subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and the investment firm GIC which is tied to the government of Singapore are investing alongside Blackstone.

For Brian Loftus market research and benchmarking analyst at the contractors group HARDI the deal is an endorsement of HVACR during a major shift in the infrastructure that supports it.

“Blackstone’s investment in Climate Technology is confirmation that the electrification growth story is real. Blackstone is not a slash-and-dash investor. They see the strategic value and potential of climate technology as does Emerson” Loftus said. “The whole industry is going to evolve as the infrastructure changes. Emerson’s going to continue to own a big chunk of it.”

Matt Michel president of Service Nation Inc. also sees this transaction as an endorsement for the industry.

“This is further confirmation that the financial world has recognized the resilience of the HVAC industry” said Michel. “While HVAC may lack the ‘wow’ factor of some of the tech flavors of the day we perform on a steady basis.”

Loftus said he doesn’t expect the HVACR industry to see any immediate changes with the creation of the joint venture. “The Climate Technology portfolio of businesses has been an industry leader and we expect that to continue. I suspect Blackstone also expects that to continue or they would not be investing $9 billion” he wrote.

“Contractors are more worried about SEER2 than Wall Street” said Michel. When they follow private equity transactions he added contractors are looking at firms that are driving up the valuation multiples of residential contracting businesses not at companies like Blackstone.

Blackstone spokesman Matthew Anderson said HVACR distributors and contractors should expect Emerson’s Climate Technologies business to continue as usual in the coming months.

“All parties are 100% committed to ensuring a smooth transition” he said.

In a press release Emerson president and CEO Lal Karsanbhai who took over in early 2021 said the spinoff will give Emerson cash to invest in growth and the opportunity to focus on its automation business while also staying invested in the market potential of Climate Technologies.

“Our differentiated capabilities in intelligent devices and software and the focus cohesiveness and operating agility of a pure-play company will allow Emerson to bring our comprehensive automation products and solutions to a diverse set of end markets” he said.

Loftus called that a good strategy.

“It is not a mature company downsizing” he said. “It is an industry leader being fortified to compete and grow in this transformation ahead.”

Michel compared the Emerson-Blackstone deal to Honeywell’s spinoff in 2018 of what became Resideo Technologies Inc.

“Resideo and Emerson are similar as both are suppliers to unitary equipment manufacturers distributors contractors retailers and consumers” Michel said. “Both sell broadly across the industry. If any manufacturers in HVAC are going to be profitable they will be Emerson and Resideo.”

The Emerson press release said the company will be “right-sizing” its cost structure and selling its headquarters to the new joint venture then leasing back the campus for three years with an option to extend the lease for two more years. During that time it said the company will be scouting out potential locations for a new headquarters.

Anderson said the as-yet unnamed joint venture will continue to be based at Emerson’s current campus.

The report was released Friday by the Oversight Committee’s Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy. It found that many industries have increased their profits precipitously within the last two years taking advantage of uncertainty caused by the pandemic and other factors that set the stage for “excessive corporate price hikes” like Russia’s invasion of Ukraine the report reads.

Four major meat processors more than doubled their profits between 2019 and 2021 the report found while two large rental car companies nearly multiplied their profits by six times. In the oil and gas industry four major companies increased their profits by 62 percent.

Underscoring much of the instability across the global economy was the shipping industry which saw disruptions due to supply chain issues. Still these companies were able to profit from the issues nonetheless: the report found that three of the largest five shipping companies increased their profits by a staggering 29965 percent an increase of nearly 300 times their pre-pandemic profits.

These findings are staggering even if they have become relatively normalized under runaway capitalism. They represent as progressive analysts have said for months now a failure of political forces to attempt to rein in such price hikes and provide much-needed relief to the public.

“Today’s analysis reaffirms what an overwhelming 80 percent majority of Americans already recognize according to a recent poll: under the guise of inflation certain corporations excessively hiked prices far beyond what their costs necessitated further driving inflation” subcommittee Chairman Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Illinois) said in a statement. “It is unacceptable that certain companies and industries are engaged in extreme price hikes under the cover of inflation.”

Corporate executives have been openly touting this strategy to shareholders the report finds. Executives at companies like Hormel Foods Tyson Foods Autozone and others have explicitly drawn the line between inflationary conditions and raising prices and profits in calls with shareholders as the report points out.

“[A] little bit of inflation is always good in our business” one Kroger executive said in June 2021. A Tyson official said in February that “Our pricing actions and strength in the beef segment … more than offset the higher [costs of goods and services].”

“Inflation is going to be a big factor for us next year” one executive at beverage company Constellation Brands said early this year. “We’ll take as much pricing as we think the consumer can absorb.”

In other words while the working class has struggled to afford basic needs like rent food and energy in recent years corporations have viewed such conditions as an opportunity to even further squeeze the public for their money. Further they’re not afraid to admit as such openly discussing these plans in shareholder calls.

The report is drawn from testimony and evidence from left-leaning organizations like the Economic Policy Institute and the Roosevelt Institute which have indeed found that corporations are in large part responsible for inflation.

However even economists in traditionally conservative spaces have been citing corporate greed as a driver of high prices. Paul Donovan the chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management strongly urged the Federal Reserve to recognize this fact in an op-ed last week writing that because of inflation “real wage growth is catastrophically negative” and that companies “have also taken advantage of circumstances to expand profit margins.”

Waterloo-based startup P&P Optica (PPO) which uses technology to automate food inspection tasks is receiving an up to $2.4 million investment from Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.

Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada is a federal government department responsible for the regulation of agriculture. The funding was made through the department’s AgriInnovate Program and PPO said the financing be allocated towards promoting the company’s hyperspectral technology to the meat processing sector.

Founded in 1995 by researchers Romuald (Romek) Pawluczyk and Pierre Peltier PPO initially started out as a research and consulting company based in Québec City focusing on the fiber business and spectroscopy.

Starting in 2012 PPO began exploring opportunities in different industries such as plastics and oil sands. It has also put one of its spectrometers on the International Space Station. By 2015 PPO pivoted to developing solutions for the food processing industry.

Using colour and moisture analysis PPO’s imaging technology provides informative data to meat processors to help them understand their products’ contents. The system automates food inspection processes by assessing qualities such as tenderness; protein water and fat content; and freshness. It can also identify and remove foreign objects such as plastics bone and rubber.

According to PPO processors can use its technology to assess product quality in real-time and reduce food waste by helping predict potential food safety issues and prevent losses from potential contamination or product recalls.

Led by CEO Olga Pawluczyk PPO’s offering is currently used in over 10 facilities across Canada and the United States including Hormel Foods Brakebush Brothers and Fieldale Farms. The startup noted that this recent investment from Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada will support its expansion plans in the meat processing space across North America and enter new global markets as well as other parts of the food industry.

Additionally the capital will be used to build a demonstration room to optimize PPO’s technology for use by meat processing clients.

Heather Galt vice president of marketing at PPO told BetaKit that the company has received over $25 million CAD in funding to date comprising a Series B round that it closed last year in which the amount raised was not disclosed. That financing was led by AF Capital Canada with participation from Fulcrum Global Capital Export Development Canada (EDC) and others.

In 2018 PPO also secured $3.1 million from Fulcrum Global and $1 million from EDC.

PPO announced its investment from Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada on Monday following Canadian food giant Maple Leaf Foods’ statement on Sunday that it experienced a systems outage linked to a cybersecurity threat. The news came around the same time that food retailer Empire Company which owns Sobeys Lawtons IGA Safeway Farm Boy Foodland FreshCo and other brands also revealed it was experiencing an IT problem.

Galt said that PPO has worked with Maple Leaf Foods in the past and said the food company was integral in helping PPO to develop and test early versions of its system.

When asked about cybersecurity concerns within its own systems PPO said that it uses “industry best tools and practices for all of [its] systems and software and has a team of in-house experts who monitor for threats and vulnerabilities on an ongoing basis.”

MCLEAN Va. (Nov. 7 2022) — HII’s (NYSE: HII) Mission Technologies division has revealed a new medium-class unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV): REMUS 620.

Building on the design philosophy of the highly successful REMUS 300 — recently selected by the U.S. Navy as the program of record for the Lionfish Small UUV — the REMUS 620 has a battery life of up to 110 hours and a range of 275 nautical miles providing unmatched mission capabilities for mine countermeasures hydrographic surveys intelligence collection surveillance and electronic warfare.

“Retaining a forward strategic advantage requires the ability to deliver a multitude of effects from under the sea” said Duane Fotheringham president of Mission Technologies’ Unmanned Systems business group. “The REMUS 620 is the first medium UUV designed to accurately deliver this range of advanced above-and-below water effects at long range.”

Built to support current and next-generation naval and special operations forces operations REMUS 620 features a modular open architecture design to facilitate seamless payload integration and HII’s Odyssey™ suite of advanced autonomy solutions for intelligent robotic platforms.

REMUS 620 is the same size and weight of the first and only full-rate production medium UUVs: the MK 18 Mod 2 Littoral Battleship Sensing-Autonomous Undersea Vehicle (LBS-AUV) and LBS-Razorback systems operated by the U.S. Navy’s Mine Countermeasure Squadrons U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office and Submarine Forces respectively.

Multiple REMUS 620s operating collaboratively can be deployed from submarines small manned or unmanned boats amphibious ships surface combatants and helicopters. REMUS 620 can also be used as a platform to launch and operate other unmanned vehicles or payloads from beneath the sea.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vZ2NhcHRhaW4uY29tL3VzLXNoaXB5YXJkcy1yZWNvcmQtcmV2ZW51ZS1idXQtZmlyZXNhbGUtdmFsdWF0aW9ucy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US Shipyards - Record Revenue At Firesale Valuations,"With billions of dollars in new contracts why are US shipyard valuations hitting record lows?

by Captain John Konrad (gCaptain) Yesterday Bollinger Shipyards the largest privately-owned and operated shipbuilder in the United States announced that it has agreed to purchase VT Halter Marine for the incredibly low price of $15 million. This is a shockingly low price for a yard with billions of dollars of government orders plus valuable facilities and real estate. Experts say the fire sale price may indicate that Halter’s contract to build the USCG’s new Heavy Icebreaker may be in serious trouble. It’s not alone. The entire US shipbuilding industry is in trouble despite growing fear the US Navy will fight a war in the Pacific and US shipyards signing record-setting contracts.

The news about Halter’s firesale first reported by Craig Hooper at Forbes comes as a shock to the US shipbuilding industry. The risk wrapped up in Halter Marine was too much for its Singapore-based parent company ST Engineering to absorb. The contract for the first US Coast Guard Polar Security Cutter – which would be the first heavy icebreaker is a $745.9 million fixed price incentive-firm arrangement. In total the shipyard was set to get about $1.94 billion if the Coast Guard exercised all three options.

“That sounds good but it’s a very low-priced bid and to profit the shipyard had to perform perfectly” said Hooper. “Given the contract’s structure Halter Marine—and ST Engineering—had a lot to lose if the shipyard was unable to meet the price target. With a fixed price target even a modest 10% overage on a $2 billion construction contract is a tough pill to swallow for any parent company no matter how big.”

Coast Guard leaders expected Halter Marine to start cutting steel this year but the shipyard has shown no sign of getting started less than two months before the end of 2022.

ST Engineering is so motivated to get out of the deal they are willing to sell 378 acres of waterfront property – comprising 2 shipyards in Pascagoula Mississippi and two dormant yards north of Pascagoula – advanced manufacturing facilities deep technical knowledge learned building complex surveillance ships and billions of dollars in defense contracts for $15m or about the price it costs to purchase a single large container handling crane built in China.

The VT Halter Marine deal was announced on Sunday just days after the American containership company Matson awarded Halter Marine’s rival Philly Shipyard a billion-dollar order for three small 3600 TEU Jones Act ships a new record-setting price.

To put the price difference in perspective Maersk recently ordered six of the world’s most advanced methanol-powered containerships in South Korea for $1.14 billion but those ships carry 17000 TEU containers for a per TEU price of $11176. The simpler ships Matson is building in Philadelphia will cost an eye-watering $92592 per TEU.

Low Profits

You might think that American shipyards with billions of dollars in contracts and powerful protection from laws like the Jones Act are highly profitable. The truth is you could buy the largest shipyard in America for less than it would cost you to buy Roku and Peloton.

American shipyards have high capital costs. They need large workforces and lots of industrial infrastructures that require constant maintenance. So very little of their enormous income results in profits. The largest US shipyards have an even bigger problem they are monopsonies (companies with only one customer) and the US Navy – notorious for change requests and work stoppages – is more interested in building aircraft and missile systems than ships.

The cost to build a ship in the United States is astounding but these prices don’t always lead to profit. The most expensive ship ever built Gerald R. Ford class US Navy Aircraft Carrier came with a price tag of $13.3 billion and its builder Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) has three more under construction with Congress wanting to purchase more. The company also has multi-billion dollar contracts to build large-deck amphibious ships nuclear attack and ballistic missile submarines advanced destroyers and unmanned vessels. HII has a pipeline of over $60 billion in contracts with more on the way. But Wall Street only values the company at $9.75 billion.

To put that in perspective the United State’s largest and most important shipbuilder HII is worth:

Less than 1/4 the price Elon Musk paid for Twitter.

Just over 1/10th the market capitalization of Boeing

About 1/14th the value of the largest US defense contractor Raytheon.

Less than the combined price of Peleton and Roku after their prices burst

VT Halter – builder of the USCG’s forthcoming heavy icebreakers – is worth considerably less. Just $15 million.

Blame Aerospace

Even more troubling is comparing the value of the US defense contractors in aerospace to our shipbuilders. The top three aerospace companies that build missiles and planes for the Department of Defense – Raytheon Lockheed Martin and Boeing – have a combined market capitalization of over $350 billion or thirty-five times the valuation of HII.

General Dynamics (GD) the United States’ second largest shipbuilding company is worth $68 billion but they also build Gulfstream airplanes and Abrams tanks. In fact half of GD’s value is due to the doubling of its stock price since Covid hit in March 2020. Why has it doubled? In the first quarter of 2021 its aerospace division had an $11.9 billion order backlog today its backlog is $19.1 billion and rising. Meanwhile its order backlog for ships and marine systems has fallen by $7 billion over the same period.

What do all these numbers mean? While the price tag for ships is extremely expensive very little of the Pentagon’s shipbuilding money is lining the pockets of defense contractors. At the same time billions of dollars of government money have passed through aerospace defense contractors and into the pockets of wealthy investors.

In just the last three months Raytheon which produces the Javelin anti-tank missile returned $1.4B of cash to shareowners. That’s hundreds of millions more than Maersk paid for America’s allies in Korea to build six giant eco-friendly containerships and it’s almost as much as Bollinger agreed to build two heavy icebreakers.

In addition to congressional spending it’s important to look at the financial markets. The large market capitalizations of aerospace companies combined with the high-profit margins and relatively tiny labor forces that are intrinsic in building relatively small aerospace weapons like Javelin missiles make them attractive to investors and banks. This significantly lowers their cost of capital and greatly increases their access to new types of coded capital. Aerospace companies get assistance from the FAA and foreign sales help from the Department of State while shipyards must look to the mostly defunct US Maritime Administration (MARAD) and their unpopular Title XI program for financial help.

Follow The Money

Yes ships are incredibly expensive but the sad fact is that nearly every dollar of shipyard profit gets spent on American workers American shipyard infrastructure repair American steel and American interests while billions of dollars of aerospace funding pass through to stockholders and executives every single quarter.

And the Navy with its love of carriers and aviation isn’t interested in building more ships. According to recent testimony by US Navy CNO Admiral Gilday the navy wants to spend more on Raytheon missiles and less on ships and is on the hook to pay its share of the $412 billion F-35 fighter plane program but it’s also on the hook for buying new F-35’s for the Marines.

Increases in ship funding are unlikely for another reason. Under current acquisition rules funding is split evenly between the US Navy USAir Force and US Army yet – in addition to ships – US Naval Aviation must help the US Air Force pay for development aircraft like the F-35 the US Marine Corps must pay for joint development of land assets like the Javelin missile and US Navy jointly developed air defense missiles with both. As a result a huge portion of the Navy’s 1/3rd of the DoD budget is spent on aircraft and air-launched missiles.

The Navy also must shoulder the cost of transportation. By volume the large majority of equipment and fuel the Pentagon moves overseas moved is done via ship. Many of those vessels are part of the US Navy’s large fleet of expensive Military Sealift Command ships.

(The US Air Force also spends a lot on transportation but the combined fleet of all US Air Force transport aircraft can carry less than one large Maersk containership and burn hundreds of times the fuel. Fuel that often must be supplied by US Merchant Marine tankers.)

A fair allotment of the cost would have the US Air Force paying for planes and the Army funding Marine land assets and surface-to-air missile technology. But that’s not likely to happen for three major reasons:

The services fight each other for every penny The US Naval Aviation community is influential does not want to surrender any control to the Air Force A healthy percentage of enormous DoD aerospace profits are rolled into lobby efforts. The US Navy has a low level of financial acumen and does not understand modern capital asset coding The Secretary of Defense and Joint Chiefs Of Staff are Army Generals unfamiliar with shipbuilding

The US Air Force has long been a powerhouse in lobby efforts and financial engineering but now the Army has replaced them in the top spot. The US Army holds the most important Pentagon leadership roles and has built an enormous amount of power over the last two decades of the Global War on Terror. The $8 trillion dollar cost of two decades of land battles has benefited the Army most and now that we are pivoting towards the Pacific maritime domain it’s unlikely the Army will be willing to let go of control.

It’s difficult to measure the true influence the US Army has over budgeting today but one simple observation makes this clear. gCaptain attended the largest US Navy event early this year Sea-Air-Space Expo 2022 and rooms were available at the hotel that hosted the conference. During the US Army’s equivalent conference last month – AUSA 2022 – every hotel in all of Washington DC was filled to capacity. This is an enormous amount of momentum for shipbuilders to overcome.

The Future

War on Ukraine has reiterated the importance of logistics in battle and most logistics are still moved by sea yet the majority of the United States Merchant Marine’s ready reserve fleet is not ready for war. The result of the test of sealift logistics in 2019 netted a 40.7% cumulative fleet success rate. This might be ok in a Middle East land war but in the vast expanse of the Pacific ships matter most.

Some believe that aircraft can take the place of ships. That has been the case since the Battle of Midway in 1942 but times are changing and climate goals have become a top Pentagon priority. The US Air Force is the world’s biggest consumer of oil. Ships are 400% more energy efficient than planes and the carbon reduction efforts of the Biden administration are pushing for fuel reduction solutions and replacing lots of planes with a smaller number of much more capable warships is the single best war to meet climate goals.

Hardcore military planners might balk at the idea of giving up aviation capacity for increased naval capability in the Pacific just to meet a climate goal. But there are real military reasons for reducing the Pentagon’s dependence on fuel. The cyber attacks on the Colonial Pipeline and physical attacks on Nord Stream have proved that fixed pipelines are highly vulnerable to attack. The only other option for moving vast quantities of fuel to remote Pacific airbases is slow commercial oil tankers.

War in Ukraine has taught us one more important lesson… that Ukraine can fight Russia without any air superiority at all.

In the meantime let’s hope the US Army never needs to fight a battle in the Arctic. If they do getting fuel or supplies to troops will be difficult considering the US Military’s only heavy icebreaker project run by Halter Marine is likely in very big trouble indeed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vYnJlYWtpbmdkZWZlbnNlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzExL2hpaS11bnZlaWxzLW5leHQtdW5kZXJzZWEtZHJvbmUtdGhlLW1vZHVsYXItcmVtdXMtNjIwL9IBYGh0dHBzOi8vYnJlYWtpbmdkZWZlbnNlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzExL2hpaS11bnZlaWxzLW5leHQtdW5kZXJzZWEtZHJvbmUtdGhlLW1vZHVsYXItcmVtdXMtNjIwLz9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HII unveils next undersea drone the Remus 620,"WASHINGTON — HII today is unveiling its newest unmanned undersea vehicle dubbed the Remus 620 the company’s latest play in an ongoing push to angle its product line towards the US Navy’s strategy for unmanned and autonomous systems.

The UUV which is the next in a series of drones originally developed by Pocassett Mass.-based company Hydroid before it was acquired by HII in 2020 boasts a modular design meant to segregate the system’s core components from those that a customer might want to alter for their own purposes.

For example the company says the system’s size and endurance can be changed based on how many energy sections are equipped. HII claims the UUV can run for up to 110 hours or 275 nautical miles if all three energy sections are in use.

The UUV also has two universal bulkhead adapters that are intended to let the user equip the drone with unique payloads not offered or made by HII. Hardware and software development kits offered by the company are meant to give customers all the necessary technical documentation they would need to create their own novel adaptations.

Duane Fotheringham president of unmanned systems at HII Mission Technologies told Breaking Defense ahead of the vehicle’s public release that a variety of accessibility changes have also been made based on lessons learned from how customers have used older Remus models such as where certain ports and removable components are placed.

The newest Remus UUV also integrates the Odyssey autonomy software suite that HII announced earlier this year.

The drone’s design and the changes over its predecessor the Remus 600 amount to one of HII’s clearest plays yet to claim its place at the forefront of the Navy’s view for future undersea vehicle programs — with modularity a key component.

“This vehicle was designed from the beginning to be UMAA compliant” said Fotheringham referring to the Navy’s Unmanned Maritime Autonomy Architecture an integral service effort focused on the technical workings of all Navy unmanned systems. “It’s a continuing developing standard but we know the basis of it so everything that we’ve done has been built so that we will be UMAA compliant.”

The new UUV’s public release comes as the company waits for a formal solicitation for the Lionfish program. HII was selected as the prime contractor for that program through a competition held by the Defense Innovation Unit earlier this year and the Navy’s formal request for proposal is set to be published later this year.

Much like the modularity featured in the Remus 620 Fotheringham told Breaking Defense earlier this month the company aims to compartmentalize Lionfish in such a way that allows the Navy to adapt it to their own needs. The Remus 300 is the base model product being used for the Lionfish program.

Today’s release also follows HII’s wholesale rebranding announced early this year in which the company changed its name from Huntington Ingalls Industries to HII in an effort to pivot its focus away from exclusively building traditional warships such as the Ford-class aircraft carrier Enterprise (CVN-80) and leaning more into developing new technologies.",,,,,,

These customers often tell Amazon Web Services (AWS) they want to migrate their applications to AWS Cloud as part of their business strategy: to lower costs gain agility and innovate faster.

In this blog we will explore how customers who are looking at ways to run IBM software on AWS can use Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) to deploy IBM Cloud Pak for Integration (CP4I) with modernized versions of IBM integration products.

As ROSA is a fully managed OpenShift service that is jointly supported by AWS and Red Hat plus managed by Red Hat site reliability engineers customers benefit from not having to manage the lifecycle of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) clusters.

This post explains the steps to:

Create a ROSA cluster

Configure persistent storage

Install CP4I and the IBM MQ 9.3 operator

Cloud Pak for integration architecture

In this blog we are implementing a highly available ROSA cluster with three Availability Zones (AZ) three master nodes three infrastructure nodes and three worker nodes.

Review the AWS documentation for Regions and AZs and the regions where ROSA is available to choose the best region for your deployment.

Figure 1 demonstrates the solution’s architecture.

In our scenario we are building a public ROSA cluster with an internet-facing Classic Load Balancer providing access to Ports 80 and 443. Consider using a ROSA private cluster when you are deploying CP4I in your AWS account.

We are using Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) and Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) for our cluster’s persistent storage. Review the IBM CP4I documentation for information about supported AWS storage options.

Review AWS prerequisites for ROSA and AWS Security best practices in IAM documentation before deploying CP4I for production workloads to protect your AWS account and resources.

Cost

You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used when deploying CP4I in your AWS account. For cost estimates see the pricing pages for each AWS service you use.

Prerequisites

Before getting started review the following prerequisites:

Installation steps

To deploy CP4I on ROSA complete the following steps:

From the AWS ROSA console click Enable ROSA to active the service on your AWS account (Figure 2). Create an AWS Cloud9 environment to run your CP4I installation. We used a t3.small instance type. When it comes up close the Welcome tab and open a new Terminal tab to install the required packages: curl ""https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip"" -o ""awscliv2.zip"" unzip awscliv2.zip sudo ./aws/install wget https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/rosa/latest/rosa-linux.tar.gz sudo tar -xvzf rosa-linux.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin/ rosa download oc sudo tar -xvzf openshift-client-linux.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin/ sudo yum -y install jq gettext Ensure the ELB service-linked role exists in your AWS account: aws iam get-role --role-name ""AWSServiceRoleForElasticLoadBalancing"" || aws iam create-service-linked-role --aws-service-name ""elasticloadbalancing.amazonaws.com"" Create an IAM policy named cp4i-installer-permissions with the following permissions: { ""Version"": ""2012-10-17"" ""Statement"": [ { ""Effect"": ""Allow"" ""Action"": [ ""autoscaling:*"" ""cloudformation:*"" ""cloudwatch:*"" ""ec2:*"" ""elasticfilesystem:*"" ""elasticloadbalancing:*"" ""events:*"" ""iam:*"" ""kms:*"" ""logs:*"" ""route53:*"" ""s3:*"" ""servicequotas:GetRequestedServiceQuotaChange"" ""servicequotas:GetServiceQuota"" ""servicequotas:ListServices"" ""servicequotas:ListServiceQuotas"" ""servicequotas:RequestServiceQuotaIncrease"" ""sts:*"" ""support:*"" ""tag:*"" ] ""Resource"": ""*"" } ] } Create an IAM role: Select AWS service and EC2 then click Next: Permissions. Select the cp4i-installer-permissions policy and click Next. Name it cp4i-installer and click Create role. From your AWS Cloud9 IDE click the grey circle button on the top right and select Manage EC2 Instance (Figure 3). On the Amazon EC2 console select the AWS Cloud9 instance then choose Actions / Security / Modify IAM Role. Choose cp4i-installer from the IAM Role drop down and click Update IAM role (Figure 4). Update the IAM settings for your AWS Cloud9 workspace: aws cloud9 update-environment --environment-id $C9_PID --managed-credentials-action DISABLE rm -vf ${HOME}/.aws/credentials Configure the following environment variables: export ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --output text --query Account) export AWS_REGION=$(curl -s 169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document | jq -r '.region') export ROSA_CLUSTER_NAME=cp4iblog01 Configure the aws cli default region: aws configure set default.region ${AWS_REGION} Navigate to the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console and copy your OpenShift Cluster Manager API Token. Use the token and log in to your Red Hat account: rosa login --token=<your_openshift_api_token> Verify that your AWS account satisfies the quotas to deploy your cluster: rosa verify quota When deploying ROSA for the first time create the account-wide roles: rosa create account-roles --mode auto --yes Create your ROSA cluster: rosa create cluster --cluster-name $ROSA_CLUSTER_NAME --sts \ --multi-az \ --region $AWS_REGION \ --version 4.10.35 \ --compute-machine-type m5.4xlarge \ --compute-nodes 3 \ --operator-roles-prefix cp4irosa \ --mode auto --yes \ --watch Once your cluster is ready create a cluster-admin user (it takes approximately 5 minutes): rosa create admin --cluster=$ROSA_CLUSTER_NAME Log in to your cluster using the cluster-admin credentials. You can copy the command from the output of the previous step. For example: oc login https://<your_cluster_api_address>:6443 \ --username cluster-admin \ --password <your_cluster-admin_password> Create an IAM policy allowing ROSA to use Amazon EFS: cat <<EOF > $PWD/efs-policy.json { ""Version"": ""2012-10-17"" ""Statement"": [ { ""Effect"": ""Allow"" ""Action"": [ ""elasticfilesystem:DescribeAccessPoints"" ""elasticfilesystem:DescribeFileSystems"" ] ""Resource"": ""*"" } { ""Effect"": ""Allow"" ""Action"": [ ""elasticfilesystem:CreateAccessPoint"" ] ""Resource"": ""*"" ""Condition"": { ""StringLike"": { ""aws:RequestTag/efs.csi.aws.com/cluster"": ""true"" } } } { ""Effect"": ""Allow"" ""Action"": ""elasticfilesystem:DeleteAccessPoint"" ""Resource"": ""*"" ""Condition"": { ""StringEquals"": { ""aws:ResourceTag/efs.csi.aws.com/cluster"": ""true"" } } } ] } EOF POLICY=$(aws iam create-policy --policy-name ""${ROSA_CLUSTER_NAME}-cp4i-efs-csi"" --policy-document file://$PWD/efs-policy.json --query 'Policy.Arn' --output text) || POLICY=$(aws iam list-policies --query 'Policies[?PolicyName==`cp4i-efs-csi`].Arn' --output text) Create an IAM trust policy: export OIDC_PROVIDER=$(oc get authentication.config.openshift.io cluster -o json | jq -r .spec.serviceAccountIssuer| sed -e ""s/^https:\/\///"") cat <<EOF > $PWD/TrustPolicy.json { ""Version"": ""2012-10-17"" ""Statement"": [ { ""Effect"": ""Allow"" ""Principal"": { ""Federated"": ""arn:aws:iam::${ACCOUNT_ID}:oidc-provider/${OIDC_PROVIDER}"" } ""Action"": ""sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity"" ""Condition"": { ""StringEquals"": { ""${OIDC_PROVIDER}:sub"": [ ""system:serviceaccount:openshift-cluster-csi-drivers:aws-efs-csi-driver-operator"" ""system:serviceaccount:openshift-cluster-csi-drivers:aws-efs-csi-driver-controller-sa"" ] } } } ] } EOF Create an IAM role with the previously created policies: ROLE=$(aws iam create-role \ --role-name ""${ROSA_CLUSTER_NAME}-aws-efs-csi-operator"" \ --assume-role-policy-document file://$PWD/TrustPolicy.json \ --query ""Role.Arn"" --output text) aws iam attach-role-policy \ --role-name ""${ROSA_CLUSTER_NAME}-aws-efs-csi-operator"" \ --policy-arn $POLICY Create an OpenShift secret to store the AWS access keys: cat <<EOF | oc apply -f - apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: aws-efs-cloud-credentials namespace: openshift-cluster-csi-drivers stringData: credentials: |- [default] role_arn = $ROLE web_identity_token_file = /var/run/secrets/openshift/serviceaccount/token EOF Install the Amazon EFS CSI driver operator: cat <<EOF | oc create -f - apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1 kind: OperatorGroup metadata: generateName: openshift-cluster-csi-drivers- namespace: openshift-cluster-csi-drivers --- apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1 kind: Subscription metadata: labels: operators.coreos.com/aws-efs-csi-driver-operator.openshift-cluster-csi-drivers: """" name: aws-efs-csi-driver-operator namespace: openshift-cluster-csi-drivers spec: channel: stable installPlanApproval: Automatic name: aws-efs-csi-driver-operator source: redhat-operators sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace EOF Track the operator installation: watch oc get deployment aws-efs-csi-driver-operator \ -n openshift-cluster-csi-drivers Install the AWS EFS CSI driver: cat <<EOF | oc apply -f - apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1 kind: ClusterCSIDriver metadata: name: efs.csi.aws.com spec: managementState: Managed EOF Wait until the CSI driver is running: watch oc get daemonset aws-efs-csi-driver-node \ -n openshift-cluster-csi-drivers Create a rule allowing inbound NFS traffic from your cluster’s VPC Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR): NODE=$(oc get nodes --selector=node-role.kubernetes.io/worker -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') VPC_ID=$(aws ec2 describe-instances --filters ""Name=private-dns-nameValues=$NODE"" --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].{VpcId:VpcId}' | jq -r '.[0][0].VpcId') CIDR=$(aws ec2 describe-vpcs --filters ""Name=vpc-idValues=$VPC_ID"" --query 'Vpcs[*].CidrBlock' | jq -r '.[0]') SG=$(aws ec2 describe-instances --filters ""Name=private-dns-nameValues=$NODE"" --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].{SecurityGroups:SecurityGroups}' | jq -r '.[0][0].SecurityGroups[0].GroupId') aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \ --group-id $SG \ --protocol tcp \ --port 2049 \ --cidr $CIDR | jq .

Validation steps

Let’s verify our installation!

Run the commands to retrieve the CP4I URL and administrator password: oc describe platformnavigator integration-quickstart \ -n integration | grep ""^.*UI Endpoint"" | xargs | cut -d ' ' -f3 oc get secret platform-auth-idp-credentials \ -n ibm-common-services -o jsonpath='{.data.admin_password}' \ | base64 -d && echo Using the information from the previous step access your CP4I web console. Select the option to authenticate with the IBM provided credentials (admin only) to login with your admin password. From the CP4I console you can manage users and groups allowed to access the platform install new operators and view the components that are installed. Click qmgr-inst01 in the Messaging widget to bring up your IBM MQ setup (Figure 8). In the Welcome to IBM MQ panel click the CP4IQMGR queue manager. This shows the state resources and allows you to configure your instances (Figure 9).

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed IBM CP4I on Red Hat OpenShift on AWS.

Post installation

Review the following topics when you are installing CP4I on production environments:

Cleanup

Connect to your Cloud9 workspace and run the following steps to delete the CP4I installation including ROSA. This avoids incurring future charges on your AWS account:

EFS_EF_ID=$(aws efs describe-file-systems \ --query 'FileSystems[?Name==`ibm_cp4i_fs`].FileSystemId' \ --output text) MOUNT_TARGETS=$(aws efs describe-mount-targets --file-system-id $EFS_EF_ID --query 'MountTargets[*].MountTargetId' --output text) for mt in ${MOUNT_TARGETS[@]}; do aws efs delete-mount-target --mount-target-id $mt done aws efs delete-file-system --file-system-id $EFS_EF_ID rosa delete cluster -c $ROSA_CLUSTER_NAME --yes --region $AWS_REGION

Monitor your cluster uninstallation logs run:

rosa logs uninstall -c $ROSA_CLUSTER_NAME --watch

Once the cluster is uninstalled remove the operator-roles and oidc-provider as informed in the output of the rosa delete command. For example:

rosa delete operator-roles -c 1vepskr2ms88ki76k870uflun2tjpvfs --mode auto –yes rosa delete oidc-provider -c 1vepskr2ms88ki76k870uflun2tjpvfs --mode auto --yes

The President is right–particularly about the changes we’re seeing in the technology sector.

For about forty years the American technology sector has been synonymous with Silicon Valley. Even tech’s other hubs–places like Boston and Austin–have economies that largely resemble the Bay Area’s with most innovation happening in front of a keyboard and monitor; engineers developing the apps programs and platforms that occupy our digital lives.

This is an important model of innovation. But we need to remember that the future of America’s tech sector will be built on both the software and the hardware it runs on a model where innovation is undertaken by researchers at labs and workers in manufacturing facilities–not just programmers in office buildings.

Put another way the future of the American tech sector will look as much like the Hudson Valley as it does Silicon Valley. In many ways it already does.

The swath of land that extends up the Hudson River from Westchester County to Albany is the original capital of America’s computing industry. From the 1960s to the ‘90s it’s where IBM developed and manufactured the hardware advances that were foundational to the software breakthroughs that came later. Our modern computing and business environments wouldn’t exist without the mainframe.

The ecosystem that created these products is still here. It’s not just because of companies like IBM but also thanks to the talent coming from the vibrant university ecosystem that is present in the State of New York from SUNY Marist College and Rensselaer Polytechnic to Columbia Cornell and beyond. It is also the result of a state government that’s willing to support the development and manufacturing of these products.

Today America is realizing that we need to invest in this kind of tech hubs again–especially after the recent chip shortage.

America invented the semiconductor and its associated industry but on the eve of the pandemic our country only manufactured 12% of the world’s chips and none of its most advanced. We paid a price for that. There was a pandemic-induced supply crunch on everything from cars to smartphones which caused an unfortunate spike in prices. The country is recovering now but the data show our semiconductor shortage reduced economic output by a full percentage point.

And America doesn’t just need to manufacture more chips–it needs to accelerate the field of computing. More sophisticated artificial intelligence for example requires increasingly advanced chips: faster yet smaller; more powerful yet more energy efficient. Other problems–like finding the precisely correct chemical structure for advanced materials–have pushed traditional computing methods to the limit. Solving them will require an entirely new approach which will be made possible by the very type of quantum computers that IBM is pioneering in the Hudson Valley.

This was the rationale behind the historic and bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act that President Biden signed in August. The idea–which was championed by leaders from both parties like Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Senator Todd Young (R-IN)–was to use public funds to both reverse the erosion of U.S. competitiveness in semiconductors and catalyze tens of billions of dollars in private investment. The money would spur the development of new chip-making hubs drive research and development into advanced computing and spur regional economic development.

If there was any equivocation that the CHIPS strategy would work what happened during the last month in New York should put it to rest.

IBM announced $20 billion to support our work in the Hudson Valley which includes developing many future generations of mainframes quantum computers and advanced semiconductors. This comes on the heels of the chip manufacturer Micron committing $100 billion over the next two decades to develop a giant semiconductor factory in Clay New York–140 miles west of Malta New York where another chip manufacturer GlobalFoundries had already announced an expansion.

These investments will create local economies that look very different from your traditional tech hubs because they’ll benefit a much broader array of people–not just computer engineers but factory and lab workers.

Since the 1970s the lion’s share of America’s capital and talent has flowed to a few superstar cities creating what some economists have termed “durable islands of wealth and poverty.” The Hudson Valley model can help unwind this economic phenomenon because it brings so many more of us along. As President Biden relayed to the media after meeting Poughkeepsie IBMers “You do not need an advanced degree… to be making $120000 a year.”

This of course will be a decades-long project. Among other things it will require the smart implementation of the CHIPS and Science Act. Having New York play a key role in the National Semiconductor Technology Center for example would supercharge the state’s ongoing economic and workforce development and greatly augment U.S. competitiveness.

In the years ahead while Congress and the Biden Administration will certainly not agree on everything expanding the geography of innovation in our country is one of the most important endeavors we need to pursue. The Hudson Valley which is reinventing itself as the home to the future of computing is an inspiring model for what is possible when government industry and academia join forces around a unified vision. The task ahead is monumental but we will get it done–and it’s an effort all parties should get behind.

In collaboration with Labcorp  Illumina presented two important studies focusing on tumor-agnostic gene fusions in oncology patients. Labcorp is a leading global life sciences company with deep oncology expertise in precision medicine diagnostics clinical trials and drug development.

At the Phoenix Convention Center in Arizona representatives from Illumina a global leader in DNA sequencing and array-based technologies joined approximately 2000 molecular diagnostic professionals this month for the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) 2022 Annual Meeting & Expo .

Genomic alterations known as gene fusions often drive cancer and can be important across different patient tumor types. Today targeted therapies exist for a growing number of gene fusions. In order to accurately identify all potential gene fusions and genomic biomarkers a comprehensive genomic profiling test should include both RNA and DNA sequencing.

In the first study the authors analyzed more than 6700 solid tumor samples. “Using comprehensive genomic profiling or CGP with RNA sequencing we were able to identify 17 NTRK1 NTRK2 and NTRK3 fusions in 16 patient tumors 10 of which were novel—a stunning number” says Dr. Shakti Ramkissoon vice president and medical lead Labcorp Oncology. Since NTRK fusions are tumor agnostic the study authors sequenced samples from breast colorectal non-small-cell lung cancer and more. NTRK fusions are rare and can be difficult to detect by DNA sequencing alone since the gene breakpoints occur across large intronic regions and have many partner genes. The authors used TSO 500 for RNA and DNA sequencing.

To date the response rate for tumors harboring NTRK fusions treated with NTRK inhibitors has proven to be very high. With larotrectinib which is approved for all solid tumors including pediatric objective responses are observed in 79% of patients.1 This means patients may enjoy longer survival and a better quality of life—if the fusion is identified in time to receive treatment.

The second AMP abstract focuses on detection of NRG1 fusions another rare but therapeutically relevant target in cancer that cannot be detected by DNA sequencing. The study authors analyzed 4397 patient samples across multiple tumor types using TSO 500 for RNA and DNA sequencing and identified 19 NRG1 fusions in 17 unique patients. Identifying NRG1 fusions is critical since these patients typically lack other driver alterations and targeted treatment options. Patients with NRG1 fusions were eligible to participate in a clinical trial that’s currently underway. The Food and Drug Administration recently granted fast-track approval for a HER3 inhibitor (serbantumab) to treat solid tumors with NRG1 fusions.

“RNA-based sequencing has emerged as an effective method to detect novel fusions” says Dr. Pratheesh Sathyan who is part of Illumina’s Medical Affairs organization and its head of oncology in the Americas. “Illumina in collaboration with leading companies like Labcorp is bringing this technology to community oncology practices for reliable detection of the novel fusions in cancer diagnostics.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmFsLmNoaW5hZGFpbHkuY29tLmNuL2EvMjAyMjExLzA3L1dTNjM2OGJlZWFhMzEwNWNhMWYyMjc0OGE1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Illumina set for fruitful outing at 5th CIIE,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmFsLmNoaW5hZGFpbHkuY29tLmNuL2EvMjAyMjExLzA3L1dTNjM2OGJlZWFhMzEwNWNhMWYyMjc0OGE1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF34D4400>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmFsLmNoaW5hZGFpbHkuY29tLmNuL2EvMjAyMjExLzA3L1dTNjM2OGJlZWFhMzEwNWNhMWYyMjc0OGE1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbWJyaWRnZWluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL25ld3MvYm9uZmlyZS1uaWdodC0yMDIyLWluLXBpY3R1cmVzLWNhbWJyaWRnZS1maXJld29ya3MtZGlzcGxheS05MjgyODc0L9IBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbWJyaWRnZWluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL25ld3MvYW1wL2JvbmZpcmUtbmlnaHQtMjAyMi1pbi1waWN0dXJlcy1jYW1icmlkZ2UtZmlyZXdvcmtzLWRpc3BsYXktOTI4Mjg3NC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bonfire Night 2022 in pictures: Cambridge fireworks display goes off with a bang,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbWJyaWRnZWluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL25ld3MvYm9uZmlyZS1uaWdodC0yMDIyLWluLXBpY3R1cmVzLWNhbWJyaWRnZS1maXJld29ya3MtZGlzcGxheS05MjgyODc0L9IBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbWJyaWRnZWluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL25ld3MvYW1wL2JvbmZpcmUtbmlnaHQtMjAyMi1pbi1waWN0dXJlcy1jYW1icmlkZ2UtZmlyZXdvcmtzLWRpc3BsYXktOTI4Mjg3NC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF34D6F80>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbWJyaWRnZWluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL25ld3MvYm9uZmlyZS1uaWdodC0yMDIyLWluLXBpY3R1cmVzLWNhbWJyaWRnZS1maXJld29ya3MtZGlzcGxheS05MjgyODc0L9IBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbWJyaWRnZWluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL25ld3MvYW1wL2JvbmZpcmUtbmlnaHQtMjAyMi1pbi1waWN0dXJlcy1jYW1icmlkZ2UtZmlyZXdvcmtzLWRpc3BsYXktOTI4Mjg3NC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,

“The Hua Nan Carbon Neutral Megatrend Index Fund benchmarked to the ICE FactSet Carbon Neutral Megatrend Index marks the first ESG product launched that captures the megatrend around carbon intensity in Taiwan” said Magnus Cattan Head of ICE Fixed Income and Data Services in APAC region. “As ESG is becoming a more relevant focus across the APAC region we are pleased to continue expanding our portfolio of ESG offerings to clients for use in ETFs ETNs and index funds among other things.”

Hua Nan Investment Trust is part of Hua Nan Financial Group a Taiwan-based investment firm.

“We have selected the ICE FactSet Carbon Neutral Megatrend Index for our newly launched fund because it helps us look at carbon in two unique ways” said Alex Huang Chairman of Hua Nan Investment Trust. “We are focused on offering the most innovative products to our customers and using ICE’s index allows market participants to consider the green energy economies that are represented on the index and measure these companies’ carbon intensity. We believe this will be an important tool in measuring carbon intensity so our customers can make the most informed ESG investments.”

ICE’s global family of indices serves as the performance benchmark for more than $1.5 trillion in assets managed by investors around the globe. For more information about ICE’s Indices please visit: https://www.theice.com/market-data/indices.

This includes false allegations that UN peacekeepers are trafficking weapons to armed groups supporting terrorists and exploiting natural resources. This disinformation makes it harder for peacekeeping operations to implement their mandates and has put the safety of peacekeepers at risk.

This paper provides an overview of the recent rise in disinformation against MINUSCA MINUSMA and MONUSCO. It also examines how these three peacekeeping operations have been addressing disinformation and the challenges they have faced. While these initial efforts have tended to focus on strategic communications disinformation is not only a strategic communications issue; it affects all mission components and effectively tackling it requires situating it in the broader political context and understanding its drivers.

This paper offers the following questions the UN Department of Peace Operations and individual missions could consider as they develop policies guidelines structures and activities to address disinformation:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQzMjQ3LTAyMi0wMDYwMS040gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,International demand for food and services drives environmental footprints of pesticide use | Communications Earth ...,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.nature.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/s43247-022-00601-8 (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF18F7220>, 'Connection to www.nature.com timed out.

It is the responsibility of all of humanity to develop use and manage the internet well and make it more beneficial to mankind.

Since China gained full access to the internet it has always been committed to promoting internet development and governance. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 2012 the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core has adhered to the philosophy of people-centered development and attached great importance to the internet. China engages in vigorous development active use and effective governance of the internet and has made historic progress in relevant undertakings. Hundreds of millions of Chinese people have a greater sense of gain from sharing the achievements of internet development and have contributed to building a peaceful secure open cooperative and orderly cyberspace.

General Secretary Xi Jinping has proposed the important concept of building a community with a shared future in cyberspace and elaborated a series of major principles and proposals for global internet development and governance. His proposal conforms to the development trends of the information age and of human society. It responds to the risks and challenges facing cyberspace demonstrates the CPC's commitment to contributing to human progress and world harmony and reinforces China's sincere desire to strengthen internet development and governance cooperation with other countries. In the new era China's international cooperation in cyberspace under the vision of building a community with a shared future in cyberspace has continued to achieve new progress new breakthroughs and new prospects.

This white paper introduces China's vision of internet development and governance in the new era and its actions shares its achievements in promoting the building of a community with a shared future in cyberspace and outlines the prospects for international cooperation.

I. Building a Community with

a Shared Future in Cyberspace Is Essential

in the Information Age

Interconnection is the basic nature of cyberspace. Sharing and co-governance is the common vision of internet development. With the rapid development of global information technology the internet has penetrated into all aspects of human life and work. As a consequence humanity is increasingly confronted with development and security challenges in cyberspace which must be addressed through joint efforts.

1. A community with a shared future in cyberspace is an important part of a global community of shared future

The world is presently undergoing a period of profound changes on a scale unseen in a century. A new revolution in science technology and industry is gaining momentum. The Covid-19 epidemic has had a far-reaching impact while the forces of unilateralism protectionism and opposition to globalization are on the rise. The world economic recovery is sluggish frequent regional conflicts and turmoil erupt and global problems are intensifying. The world has entered a new period of turbulence and change.

Problems with the internet such as unbalanced development unsound regulation and unreasonable order are becoming more prominent. Cyber-hegemonism poses a new threat to world peace and development.

Certain countries are exploiting the internet and information technology as a tool to seek hegemony interfere in other countries' internal affairs and engage in large-scale cyber theft and surveillance raising the risk of conflict in cyberspace.

Some countries attempt to decouple with others and create schism and confrontation in cyberspace. The increasingly complex cybersecurity situation calls for more just reasonable and effective cyberspace governance. Global threats and challenges in cyberspace necessitate strong global responses.

China is the world's largest developing country and the country with the largest number of internet users. It understands the underlying trends of the information age; upholds a people-centered approach; and supports global governance based on extensive consultation joint contribution and shared benefits. China insists that the building of a community with a shared future in cyberspace should be based on multilateral and multiparty participation and consultation respect for cyber sovereignty and a spirit of partnership; and the international community should be encouraged to expand pragmatic cooperation and jointly deal with associated risks and challenges. The goal of building a community with a shared future in cyberspace conforms to the developments of the information age and meets the needs and expectations of the people throughout the world. It is a plan that China contributes to the global efforts to promote the development and governance of cyberspace on the basis of respecting cyber sovereignty.

The community with a shared future in cyberspace is an important part of a global community of shared future. Related concepts and proposals on development security governance and universal benefits are in conformity with the concepts of a global community of shared future and the distinctive features of cyberspace; and promoting a community with a shared future in cyberspace will provide abundant digital impetus a solid security safeguard and a broader consensus on cooperation to this end.

2. Build a community of development security responsibility and shared interests

IV. China's Proposals on Creating a Community

with a Shared Future in Cyberspace

The internet is the shared home of all of humanity. It is the common responsibility of the international community to make this home cleaner safer and more prosperous. China will join other countries to build a community with a shared future in cyberspace so that the fruits of internet development can benefit everyone. As always China will do so based on its national conditions and in the spirit of people-centered open and win-win cooperation.

1. Respecting network sovereignty

China advocates respect for the cyber sovereignty of all countries. It respects the right of every country to independently choose its path of cyber development model of network management and public policy on internet issues as well as its right to equal participation in international cyberspace governance. China firmly opposes all forms of hegemony and power politics interference in other countries' internal affairs and double standards. It does not support engage in or conspire around cyber activities that undermine national security in other countries.

China advocates that the principle of sovereign equality established by the UN Charter be applied to cyberspace and that a just and rational international order in cyberspace be built on the basis of national sovereignty.

2. Maintaining peace security and stability in cyberspace

Cyberspace is interconnected resulting in the deep integration of the interests of all countries. Peace security and stability in cyberspace are the common wishes of people all over the world. China maintains that all governments should abide by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter make peaceful use of the internet and settle disputes by peaceful means. China opposes the so-called absolute security for some at the expense of the interests of others and any form of arms race in cyberspace. China advocates that the cybersecurity concerns of all countries large or small strong or weak rich or poor should be noted and addressed and that countries should make peaceful use of cyberspace to promote economic and social development and conduct cooperation and dialogue at all levels – global bilateral multilateral and multiparty – to jointly safeguard peace and stability in cyberspace.

3. Creating an open fair just and non-discriminatory digital environment

The global digital economy is an open and closely connected whole. Those who build walls and barriers and call for decoupling and severing supply chains will hurt not only others but also themselves. Win-win cooperation is the only way forward. Creating an open fair just and non-discriminatory environment for digital development is a requirement for stronger global digital economic cooperation which will promote the recovery and development of the global economy. China opposes the politicization of technological issues and the containment of other countries' enterprises by abusing state power and violating market principles and trading rules. China advocates that all governments should actively maintain open secure and stable global supply chains for IT products and services strengthen collaborative R&D on new generations of information technology and integrate into the global innovation network. Governments international organizations businesses and think thanks should discuss and develop international rules of digital governance that reflect the wishes of all parties and respect the interests of all to promote the healthy and orderly development of the digital economy.

4. Strengthening international cooperation in protecting critical information infrastructure

Critical information infrastructure is one of the foundations for the normal operation of the economy and society of all countries in the information age. It is the common responsibility of the international community to effectively address any security risks in this regard. China firmly opposes the use of information technology to undermine the critical information infrastructure of other countries steal their data or engage in any other form of zero-sum game. The international community should advocate the concept of cybersecurity based on openness and cooperation and oppose network eavesdropping and cyberattacks. Governments and relevant authorities of all countries should strengthen cooperation on early warning risk prevention information sharing and emergency response and actively share experience on protecting critical information infrastructure.

5. Maintaining the security and stability of the core-resource management system for the internet

The core-resource management system for the internet is the cornerstone of internet operations. It should be guaranteed that those institutions hosting the management systems operate with full credibility and do not pose a threat to the top-level domains of any country just because of the jurisdictional demands on some other country. China advocates guaranteed availability and reliability of core internet resources – to be used by all countries and jointly managed and fairly distributed by the international community so that the technological systems for the resources including the domain name system are secure stable and resilient. There should be a guarantee that services will not be interrupted or terminated due to any political or human factors. China advocates that governments industry authorities and businesses work together to accelerate the use of IPv6 technology and applications.

6. Cooperation in combating cybercrime and cyberterrorism

Cyberspace should not be a wrestling field for countries fighting against each other nor a hotbed for crimes. Currently cybercrime and cyberterrorism have become a global scourge and they must be fought against through international cooperation. China proposes that governments of all countries should work together within the framework of relevant laws and international conventions to crack down on all forms of cybercrime. China calls for removing the hotbed for cybercrime and severing all criminal links and building a better mechanism for judicial and law enforcement cooperation against cybercrime and cyberterrorism. China is an active supporter and participant in negotiations on a United Nations Convention against Cybercrime and calls for an international cyberspace counter-terrorism treaty. China would like to coordinate with other governments in drafting laws and taking actions to jointly tackle the threat of cybercrime and cyberterrorism.

7. Promote data security development and utilization

Data are a new type of production factor – the basis for digital internet and smart technologies. Data have been integrated into various areas of production distribution circulation consumption and social service management profoundly changing people's approach to work daily life and social governance. China supports the flow development and utilization of data and promotes data sharing and would like to actively work with other countries international organizations enterprises and think tanks engaging in exchanges and cooperation to safeguard data security development and utilization promoting relevant international rules and standards under bilateral and multilateral frameworks and steadily ensuring the interoperability of different data protection rules to promote the safe and free flow of data across borders.

8. Build a fairer and more rational cyberspace governance system

Cyberspace is globally interconnected so no country can effectively govern it alone. China supports the United Nations as the main player in international cyberspace governance. China upholds genuine multilateralism and opposes any form of unilateralism camps or coteries targeting specific countries. China champions multilateral participation leveraging the role of various parties including governments international organizations internet companies technology communities non-governmental organizations and individuals. Following the principles of extensive consultation joint contribution and shared benefits the international community should step up communication exchange and pragmatic cooperation improve dialogue and consultation mechanisms on cyberspace and formulate global internet governance rules so that the global internet governance system becomes fairer and more rational and reflects the aspirations and interests of the majority of countries in a more balanced way.

9. Jointly building a better cyberspace

Internet civilization is an important symbol of the progress of modern society. To meet netizens' desire for a better life it is imperative to step up the construction of internet civilization. China respects the diversity of internet culture and holds that all countries should tap their own excellent cultural resources support the digitalization and online dissemination of their quality cultural products encourage online cultural exchange and learning between the civilizations of various countries regions and nations and promote the co-existence and common development of all civilizations. China proposes that countries should cooperate with each other industry organizations and companies should strengthen self-discipline and individuals should improve their digital literacy combining to counter fake online information strengthen cyber governance maintain sound online order and enrich cyberspace with the excellent fruits of human civilization.

10. Sharing the benefits of the internet

The internet develops through joint efforts and its fruits should also be shared. China proposes that the international community should make joint efforts to advance the construction of information infrastructure and bridge the digital divide step up support and help to vulnerable groups and promote digital literacy and skills for the general public. Internet and digital technology should play a full role in combating epidemics improving people's lives and eliminating poverty. The international community should promote new technologies and applications for the common good provide more innovative digital products and promote open inclusive sharing balanced and sustainable development. Efforts should be made for more countries and people to benefit from the information technology enjoy the fruits of internet development and actively contribute to the implementation of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

The internet is the common home of mankind. Everyone shares weal and woe in cyberspace no matter how innovative digital technology develops and how the international situation changes. Building a peaceful secure open cooperative and orderly cyberspace is important for the future development of human civilization and is the common aspiration of all countries.

In an era of both challenges and hope China would like to work with other countries to foster an open inclusive and vibrant cyberspace that is fairer more secure and more stable. Let us join hands together to build a community with a shared future in cyberspace and create a better world."

That holds huge potential value for stakeholders across the industry – but only if they can ascertain how to extract consistent insights from this mountain of information.

So far they haven’t seen a lot of success.

There are several challenges to overcome to realize the value of healthcare data evidenced by the fact that 97% of healthcare data go unused after their initial creation. For instance 80% of healthcare data is unstructured in narrative notes reports images and other formats. Furthermore the average healthcare system has patient data in as many as 15 disparate systems – a challenge of both systems interoperability and multiple unharmonized coding and naming conventions. Set alongside complex regulatory requirements it is no surprise so little healthcare data is efficiently used. In an industry built on innovation it is frustrating to lose so much value which is why industry leaders like IQVIA have been working for years to tear down these obstacles and automate our access to insights. And we are making tremendous strides in this journey.

In our latest webinar Automate Data Transformation To Accelerate Healthcare Insights IQVIA healthcare data and artificial intelligence (AI) experts Georg Turi Maciek Piotrowski and Dr. Calum Yacoubian discussed the challenges the industry currently faces generating value from healthcare data and how applications that combine data standardization natural language processing (NLP) privacy preserving techniques and versatile extract transform and load (ETL) processes are helping healthcare organizations leapfrog their competitors in the quest for better faster data analytics.

Insights at your fingertips

A poll of attendees at the webinar found the majority of industry professionals say their biggest challenge with healthcare data today is interoperability across complex and expanding data sources. They are also frustrated over working with large volumes of unstructured data.

These results reflect what IQVIA’s experts have heard for years. Most healthcare organizations and life sciences companies who are trying to generate insights from healthcare data spend 80% of their time cleaning and wrangling data assets and only 20% realizing any value from them. They also struggle to balance strict data privacy regulations and lack of central governance frameworks with efforts to maximize data utility.

None of these challenges can be overcome by human effort alone. They require a digital environment that is purpose-built to curate integrate and standardize structured and unstructured health records from any data source using any coding standard. To do that these digital solutions have to be able to de-identify and anonymize every data point and perform complex data transformations that link raw data from different sources into a single standardized location for more robust analysis at scale.

The ideal digital platform will automate most of these steps freeing healthcare experts to spend their time asking questions and using the insights generated to make more informed decisions. Once companies achieve this future state the data paradigm flips allowing healthcare teams to spend 20% of their time on data management tasks and 80% realizing value from them.

IQVIA’s Health Data Transformation Platform already delivers this digital vision today by combining AI-driven technology global real-world healthcare data sets and industry-leading expertise to bring life sciences companies into the future of automated data analytics. This automated multi-functional platform curates complex patient healthcare information from heterogenous data sources and then de-identifies standardizes and transforms it into an analytics-ready unified output – that is easily queryable and searchable for use case specific insights generation.

Medicines account for between 25-33% of all healthcare emissions.

The pharmaceutical industry needs more data on emissions and companies need to collaborate to reduce their carbon footprint.

Rapid climate change has a direct impact on human health. These damaging effects arise from multiple causes such as increased allergens changes in the ecology of disease vectors and conflicts over resources (see figure 1 below). This risk to human health bears down heavily upon healthcare systems.

The pharmaceutical industry needs more data on emissions and companies need to collaborate to reduce their carbon footprint. Image: IQVIA

Ultimately healthcare should be a sector that cares for the whole population healthy and sick. This can be a challenge when resources are scarce; for example a report in 2021 suggested less than half (44%) of the public believed that the National Health Service (NHS) in England should be responsible for reducing its carbon footprint and most had given it a lower priority than competing concerns such as reducing waiting times or boosting staff morale. We recognise these immediate challenges but also believe that health systems need to reduce their emissions which collectively is a significant step towards fostering wellness.

The carbon footprint of medicines

The NHS in England was the first healthcare system to commit to becoming net zero by 2045. During COP26 an additional 13 national health systems set net-zero dates but large countries have yet to make this commitment including Germany France Italy and the US.

To achieve net zero in healthcare providers first need to take stock of the current situation. In the past decade a small number of healthcare systems have attempted to identify their sources of carbon emissions. Recent figures from the UK and France suggest the contribution from medicines ranges between 25-33% of all healthcare emissions. It is likely that medicines will continue to be a focus area for emissions reductions in the foreseeable future.

This means addressing the volume use of the majority of medicines. IQVIA calculates that 500 pharmaceutical manufacturers are responsible for 80% of the volume of all medicines consumed by patients worldwide (e.g. pills ampoules pens containers etc.) – it is these manufacturers who need to make the biggest changes (see figure 2 below).

The contribution from medicines ranges between 25-33% of all healthcare emissions. Image: IQVIA

Of these 500 companies 20% have their headquarters in the US 30% in Europe and 40% in India or China. With Europe and the US leading on policies to reduce emissions by manufacturers further enforcement could yield meaningful results. However for companies headquartered in India and China where there has historically been lower regulatory oversight the industry needs to do more to promote supply chain transparency and greener manufacturing. Actions such as introducing stricter procurement practices or introducing certifications could help.

Quantifying the pharmaceutical industry’s carbon footprint

Some types of medicine have especially high carbon footprints. Health systems can identify where to make reductions by mapping the carbon footprints of medicines to global use. Two areas highlighted by the NHS are anaesthetic gases and inhalers.

The global use of anaesthetics has increased steadily over the past decade roughly matching population growth. Yet the resulting carbon footprint has decreased especially in the past five years (figure 3 below) primarily driven by the conscious substitution of desflurane a common anaesthetic gas with greener gases such as sevoflurane. Amongst anaesthetic gases desflurane is one of the most harmful having 20 times the global warming effect than alternatives in a clinical setting.

The global use of anaesthetics has increased steadily over the past decade but their carbon footprint has decreased. Image: IQVIA

This is a clear case study showing how the industry can enact meaningful change. On the other hand inhalers are yet to undergo this inflection point in their global emissions. As with anaesthetics the use of inhalers for asthma and other respiratory conditions has increased steadily over the past decade and their total carbon footprint has also increased (figure 4 below).

The use of inhalers has increased steadily over the past decade and their total carbon footprint has also increased Image: IQVIA

Pressurised metered-dose inhalers the cheapest and most popular type are the main carbon footprint drivers owing to their use of propellants that have a high global warming potential. Propellant-free inhalers have not yet taken over as the dominant technology due to low availability amongst generic inhalers lack of awareness and institutional inertia.

Three ways we can shape greener healthcare systems

There are many ways to reduce the carbon footprint of healthcare systems and stakeholders are beginning to understand the key next steps. The first is to identify the areas where immediate impact can be made – but we simply do not have the research to give us the knowledge on which processes and products emit the most greenhouse gases.

We hope that greater clarity can be achieved to make smarter evidence-based decisions and recommend three key steps:

1. Commission lifecycle studies for relevant insights

For medicines generating data across a wider range of product classes can get us closer to pinpointing areas to address. The progress made globally with anaesthetic gases highlights how effective this can be.

2. Collaborate to share information across sector boundaries

Emissions do not happen in isolation and some initiatives could have counterproductive consequences further down the line; as exemplified by the negative impact of replacing plastic bags with cotton totes. We need to take a holistic approach in which public and private institutions can collaborate to share data and agree on reporting frameworks.

Discover How is the World Economic Forum bringing data-driven healthcare to life? Show more The application of “precision medicine” to save and improve lives relies on good-quality easily-accessible data on everything from our DNA to lifestyle and environmental factors. The opposite to a one-size-fits-all healthcare system it has vast untapped potential to transform the treatment and prediction of rare diseases—and disease in general. But there is no global governance framework for such data and no common data portal. This is a problem that contributes to the premature deaths of hundreds of millions of rare-disease patients worldwide. The World Economic Forum’s Breaking Barriers to Health Data Governance initiative is focused on creating testing and growing a framework to support effective and responsible access – across borders – to sensitive health data for the treatment and diagnosis of rare diseases. The data will be shared via a “federated data system”: a decentralized approach that allows different institutions to access each other’s data without that data ever leaving the organization it originated from. This is done via an application programming interface and strikes a balance between simply pooling data (posing security concerns) and limiting access completely.

3. Create an environment of accountability across all pharmaceutical players

Real change requires global action across pharmaceutical manufacturing with shared responsibility for this at all levels within organisations. Companies should adapt procurement practises to influence purchasing decisions with external and international organisations. Holding everyone to a minimum standard is important and purchasers wield a lot of power here.",,,
IRM,Iron Mountain,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mcmVlcC5jb20vaW4tZGVwdGgvbmV3cy9jb2x1bW5pc3RzL2pvaG4tY2FybGlzbGUvMjAyMi8xMS8wNi91LXAtYmlrZS1zaG9wLW93bmVyLWtlZXBzLWdpdmluZy1iaWtlcy1mb3ItZnJlZS82OTU5MDY0NTAwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.P. bike shop owner keeps giving his stock away for free,"KINGSFORD — Things just somehow happen you know? It blows his mind! There's no way you could never plan anything and have it turn out as amazing as it usually does he often says. No it’s better just to let things happen spontaneously. Like that time for instance when the police happened to show up because he spontaneously decided to go horseback riding one afternoon in downtown Iron Mountain.

It all started the night before part of another spree of impulses whims and happenstance when he just as randomly came up with the idea to surprise some kids with a bicycle delivery as they fished by a river.

“This will be priceless!” said an excited Steven Pringle the owner of an unusual Upper Peninsula bike shop named Build a Bicycle — Bicycle Therapy. He founded it one night when he was living in a camper with little else but his depression renting a storage unit to use as his repair shop building and fixing bicycles as a distraction from his misery.

He never wanted it to be a real store. Yet a few years later he owns one of the more successful bike shops in the region. He’s not sure how because he didn’t really try. Plus he keeps giving away the store’s stock for free.

“I can never really explain it ‘cause it was never meant to be” the goateed ponytailed 57-year-old said. “It just happened.”

He met these kids when their mom brought her dead brother’s bike to him to refurbish a sentimental request. He did the job without charging. When he returned it to her he took one look at her kids’ bikes and overhauled them for free too. Now that the work was finished he decided he wanted to present their upgraded bikes to them. Right now! He called their mom looking for them. She said they were fishing along the river. Also it was like 9 at night. A little bit late. But he figured why wait until tomorrow when you’re excited today? So he decided he'd bring the bikes to the river that evening.

Three kids fished from the bank by themselves in the soft blue twilight. They looked up as a truck rolled to a stop. An energetic man jumped out. He called them over by their names. They recognized him as the bike man.

“I’ve got your bikes for you!” he hollered. “Come on up here to get your bikes real quick. And then your mom said you gotta go home.”

The bewildered middle-schoolers walked up the bank took their bikes and thanked him for the upgrades. They borrowed his phone called their mom told her about the bikes and asked if they could stay out a little longer now that they had a quick way home. There were still fish to be caught. She said yes.

Pringle grinned. “See how things just happen?”

* * *

He didn’t always believe in letting things just happen.

“I was brought up like you just work. I was created by my parents to be a doer” said Pringle whose parents had him working full time at both his dad’s gas station and his mom’s beauty parlor when he was still in middle school. “My mom she was a good person but she was too work work work. I didn’t have a life.”

He was born and raised in Marquette enlisted in the Army served in Lebanon in the ‘80s came home to Michigan became a car salesman and eventually had his own dealership a girlfriend and six kids.

But it didn’t last. “I used to own a car lot but in essence it was a car lot that owned me.” One thing led to another and his life crumbled. Slowly he lost the business the house the family himself.

“I went through a time in my life that really felt like the darkest time ever like life was over” he said. He was living alone in a camper marinating in despair immersing himself in prayer fasting into anorexia desperately seeking answers. Then he said he had an epiphany one night while praying the rosary. “It was like boom! Wow! I was crying like are you kidding me? When I went through that that’s when love hit me. All of a sudden I felt something I wasn’t brought up with.”

Everything changed after that. He started eating better and exercising. Someone gave him an old bike so he could get around and he worked on fixing it up. He realized that the activity served as a form of distracting self-help and he began building bicycles from spare parts.

“Bicycle therapy is working with your hands getting out of your mind moving getting out and doing something. If you sit there in your mind you’re going to be stuck in your mind in compulsive obsessive thoughts. If you have a thought and you feed that thought it lives. And when it lives it consumes you.”

He told others about his bicycle therapy idea and soon people came. Most were fellow veterans dealing with mental or emotional problems and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and physical disabilities. And they were asking if they could help build and fix bicycles with him.

“But they weren’t coming for bikes” said John Koleas 37 one of the shop’s first employees. “We’d just sit and talk and we would vibe together drink coffee together.”

Pringle explained to them how he quit trying to control everything; how whatever happens is probably meant to be; how by accepting everything everything becomes acceptable.

“Some people don’t understand what I’m saying just to be able to relax and God’s gonna do what he’s gonna do. If I think I’m gonna go out and make something happen that something’s going to be a certain way I’m going to be in the way. So people would just stop in just to see what was going to happen next.""

He bought a small building in Kingsford moved in with the bikes and named the place after his newfound method of therapy. But he still didn’t want a business. “I was here six months and people wanted me to work on bikes. I told them I don’t work on bikes. I just wanted to help people having difficulties and struggles. I wanted to be a ministry.”

Then the pandemic happened. Suddenly bicycles were in huge demand. “I sold like 30 bikes in a week and I was scratching my head” he said. But he realized what was going on before others did and he ordered hundreds of bicycles. As other stores ran out of stock he had the only bikes for hundreds of miles around. Whether he wanted to be or not he was now a bike shop owner.

“We were so busy during that summer” he said. “It was unreal the amount of bikes that were sold. I look back and think how did it even get done? How did it happen? How did we have bikes that nobody else had? I’m just a little guy and it’s just grown so huge. And it’s amazing ‘cause there’s no way we could’ve ever planned it.”

Some bikes here sell for thousands of dollars to customers from all over the country. But out front there’s still an array of old repaired bikes offered for free; hundreds so far have been taken. He sometimes drives hours to 4-H horse shows and county fairs and gives away bikes to farm kids. And he donates bikes to local foster organizations prisoner rehabilitation services and vocational programs for people with disabilities. Yet the more he's given away the more successful the shop has become.

“I’ve had people in the beginning who told me ‘You donate too much.’ But the more we donate the more that comes back at the end of the day” said Pringle. “I don’t need money. What am I gonna do with it collect it and save it? As I spiritually grew I knew the car lot owned me so I can never own anything again. So when someone talks about how much I might give well I already sold three e-bikes this week. That far surpasses anything I could’ve given away in that time. For what little bit we’ve given away three times has already come back.”

The next morning Pringle was frenzied. He woke up determined to hand out more bicycles. This time they would go to some nuns. And he had only a few minutes to deliver them.

“I’m at crunch time right now” he said hurriedly. “I told them I’d be there at 10 o’clock. They got Mass at 10:30. I’m already late.”

Years ago he sought a zoning change for his car lot’s property which required the approval of the neighbors. Among them were the nuns of the Carmelite Monastery of the Holy Cross in Iron Mountain members of an 800-year-old Catholic order dedicated to cloistered life. He didn’t know anything about them back then only that they never leave the enclosed monastery and almost never allow visitors. He was granted a meeting.

“You go in and you sit down at a table facing a curtain” he said “and the curtain opened up and every hair on my body stood up and I just got real emotional like something spiritual happened and I had no idea what.”

Years later when he was at rock bottom he remembered them and wrote them a letter asking for their prayers. After his epiphany he felt they had a hand in it and he wanted to return the favor. One day after buying himself a new washer and dryer he figured who wouldn't like a new washer and dryer? So he bought them a set showed up at the convent gates and delivered this spontaneous appliance surprise. Every now and then he brings them something else. Today it would be bicycles.

“Their families don’t even get to see them!” he said darting around his shop going from bike to bike filling the tires adjusting the brakes. “So for us to be able to talk and communicate with them that’s so powerful. It’s a gift. I’m speechless.”

A few minutes later he pulled right up to the entrance of the monastery with only minutes to spare and rang the doorbell. The heavy iron gates swung open with great gravity and there stood three nuns in their habits wearing thick wooden rosaries cinched around their waists.

“I brought you some bikes!” he announced cheerfully. Two tricycles one two-wheeler. Brand new.

“Oh my goodness” they said in surprise. They thanked and blessed him profusely. The nuns could now ride bikes around the grounds of the monastery during their outside time the mother superior told him. One of them walked to their kitchen brought back a loaf of homemade cinnamon bread for him to take home promised to pray for him and they all said goodbye as the thick gates closed sheltering them from the world once more. Pringle grew teary-eyed as he held the bread.

“It just amazes me"" he said. ""I’m not a big baby but when I see these things or be part of them I can’t help it. It’s unbelievable! Like I said you couldn’t plan the stuff that happens around here.”

* * *

Back at the shop a woman and her young daughter were waiting for Pringle to return. He’d invited them over after a friend told him about their situation. They’d fled a domestic violence situation in New York recently with only the clothes on their backs. Iron Mountain was their fresh start. Pringle wanted to help. And bicycles were his means to do so.

“I heard something that blew my mind” Pringle said to 8-year-old Kadence Horton as he walked back into the shop. “How come you haven’t learned how to ride a bike yet?”

Ryan Garza Detroit Free Press

“She got a bike a long time ago” explained her mom 29-year-old Sarah Froland “and somebody told her on the school bus during kindergarten that only dads can teach kids how to ride bikes. So then she wouldn’t let me teach her because I was a mom. And well I’m a single parent so eventually we tried to get her to warm up that moms can teach you how to ride bikes too but it never went through.”

“Well let me tell you something really cool” Pringle told the girl. “You know why I can help? I’m a dad and I might not be your dad but I’m a rent-a-dad. I can be everybody’s dad. I’m dad to a lot of people. And I’ll offer to teach you how to ride and I’d love to show you and make sure you get real good at it.”

Soon the girl had a new bicycle a new helmet and a rent-a-dad. Outside Pringle held the back of the bike steady as the girl haltingly practiced riding while he explained to her the gears the motions the brakes the kickstand. After some practice she could briefly ride alone. Her mom's eyes got misty as she watched. Pringle’s voice cracked.

“You know the amount of people that we’ve been able to help it just kind of blows my mind” he said. Out front a truck pulled up to the curb with some used bikes to donate. They’d soon be repaired and offered for free out front.

“How does it happen here? At a little bike shop? It has to flow through me. It’s not me at all. So to think that so much can flow through a little bit of nothing and it has done pretty neat things I can’t even.”

It was noon. Kurt Berger sat in his chair next to his dog. The 50-year-old sipped his beer looked outside the window of his first-floor apartment in downtown Iron Mountain and noticed that there was a horse standing outside waiting for him.

An hour earlier Pringle was making the rounds around town in his truck picking up bikes that needed repairs so he could take them back to the shop and fix them. One stop was to see Berger an unemployed Army veteran who showed up at the bike shop a while back after hearing that vets were welcome to seek self-betterment there. His bike was broken leaving him stranded in his small apartment.

Bicycle therapy had rubbed off on him and he was trying to improve himself in his own way. “I quit drinking alcohol and I switched to beer” he announced proudly to Pringle who listened as he loaded the bike into the truck. “I was drinking rum and cokes from the minute I got up 'til I went to bed. See now I limit myself. I don’t start drinking beer until about noon 11ish. I just cracked one open.”

Weeks before this Pringle and girlfriend Lindsey Gagne were riding horses around town something they do when the mood strikes. “People smile they enjoy it they come out to see the horses and they’re just totally amazed” Pringle said. “It’s neat because it’s showing people something good; showing people something to be happy about. There’s so much negativity in the world. And this is something positive.”

As Berger talked about his drinking and his unemployment and his PTSD and his overweight dog Pringle remembered how excited Berger got when they rode the horses past his apartment not long ago. Maybe a visit from a horse he thought might really cheer this veteran up. Why not? Let’s do this!

An hour later there was a horse looking into Berger's front window as his dog barked hysterically at this massive hitherto unseen animal while Gagne waited alongside on her own horse. Berger leaped up in excitement and came outside. Then he ran back in to put on some pants before reemerging.

“This is Tucker” Pringle announced as he got off his horse. “And you’re going to ride him.”

""I love animals"" said Berger who admitted that he suffers from PTSD. ""It takes all my problems away for the moment. I feel so good today that I don’t feel like I need my medication."" Ryan Garza Detroit Free Press

Berger hoisted his large frame onto the horse. He beamed a deep smile. He rode his horse behind Gagne and hers down an alley and they took a meandering ride through downtown Iron Mountain together side by side. Cars going past came to a stop. People snapped photos and took video. Customers drinking at the Wild Horse Saloon came outside in disbelief to watch their bar’s avatar strolling past.

Berger was having a blast. “I love animals” he said. “It takes all my problems away for the moment. What a way to lift my spirits man. I feel so good today that I don’t feel like I need my medication.”

They rode past tall buildings down crowded streets and into the drive-thru at Wendy’s where they ordered some food as cars backed up behind them and the horse stuck its head into the pickup window.

That’s when the police showed up.

A cop asked Pringle what he was doing bringing a horse into town. “You know what we’re doing? We’re sharing some smiles and joy” Pringle told the officer in a deadpan tone.

“I know” said the weary cop. “The only reason I’m coming to address it is because someone complained about it.” He dutifully gave Pringle a copy of the ordinance against riding livestock through town as a warning and left.

“There’s always got to be one person to ruin it” Pringle said. “But you know what’s nice? The smiles the joy the veteran we actually came to see. That’s what this was about.”

He and his girlfriend put the horses in the trailer and headed toward the shop back to the comparatively boring business of selling bikes. But before they even arrived the officer called. He'd spoken to the chief who said he wasn't about to let an ordinance get in the way of smiles and joy especially when offered to a veteran by a whimsical bike shop owner on the back of a horse strolling through the city's downtown. Keep doing what you're doing he was told. Pringle was elated.

“See what I said? You couldn’t plan it! I remembered he was so excited about the horses I say there it is right there. Let’s share that little bit of joy with him. It just happens. And that’s how it’s supposed to happen.”

Credit: 901263 / Pixabay.

A study by non-profit ocean conservation organisation Oceana has revealed that beverage company Coca-Cola increased its plastic packaging by 8.8% in one year.

The finding follows after Oceana analysed data from the Global Commitment 2022 Progress Report released by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation earlier this week.

The plastic packaging usage by Coca-Cola increased by more than 263 thousand metric tonnes from a reported 2.96 million metric tonnes in 2020 to 3.22 million metric tonnes in 2021.

Oceana strategic initiatives director Dana Miller said: “This new report makes it clear that Coca-Cola’s recycling pledges are not stopping the ever-growing tsunami of plastic that is overwhelming our oceans.

“How can the company use an additional 500 million pounds of plastic in one year and at the same time consider itself to be addressing its plastic problem?

“Bottles with recycled content will still be thrown away sent to landfills burned or littered. Some of these bottles will end up in our oceans.”

In response to the findings Oceana has called on Coca-Cola to increase refillable bottles to address its plastic problem.

According to the organisation a single refillable bottle can be used up to 25 times thereby preventing 24 single-use plastic bottles and 49 single-use bottle glass bottles.

Dana Miller added: “Just a 10% increase in refillable bottles in all coastal countries could reduce marine plastic bottle pollution by 22%.

“If Coca-Cola is serious about reducing plastic pollution it needs to stop promoting single-use throwaway plastic bottles and instead deliver on its commitment to sell 25% of its drinks in refillable and reusable bottles and containers.”

The new finding comes after a new study commissioned by Oceana exposed the weakness of plastic recycled content pledges made by beverage companies including Coca-Cola PepsiCo Nestlé Danone and Keurig Dr Pepper.

Most of these companies pledged to increase post-consumer recycled content in their polyethylene terephthalate plastic bottles from 25 to 50% by 2025.

In February Coca-Cola pledged to make 25% of all its beverage packaging across its brand portfolio reusable by 2030.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmp1c3QtZHJpbmtzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3JlZC1idWxsLWxheXMtb3V0LXJlc3RydWN0dXJlZC1ib2FyZC1mb2xsb3dpbmctY28tZm91bmRlcnMtZGVhdGgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Red Bull's Mark Mateschitz lays out a restructured board of directors.,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.just-drinks.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/red-bull-lays-out-restructured-board-following-co-founders-death/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF1DC9E40>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmp1c3QtZHJpbmtzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3JlZC1idWxsLWxheXMtb3V0LXJlc3RydWN0dXJlZC1ib2FyZC1mb2xsb3dpbmctY28tZm91bmRlcnMtZGVhdGgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,

WNC History

“I tried one out and wore it three days cleaned the house mopped waxed the floors washed five girls’ heads bathed the dogs and did everything else necessary in a house with five bedrooms two baths ten people and two dogs and it was still in one piece” wrote a young California mother of eight to the Mars Manufacturing Company of Asheville complementing their new disposable product - the paper dress.

“When we get ready to paint I will get another and save ruining a cotton house dress” the woman continued. “Also at canning season I intend to have three or four as I always ruin a couple of dresses with stain from something”

Originally conceived in 1966 as a marketing gimmick by the Scott Paper Company to sell more disposable paper products the paper dress quickly became a fashion fad. Women could get a paper dress branded a “Paper Caper” by clipping a coupon from an advertisement in Seventeen magazine and sending it along with two proofs of purchase and $1.25 to Scott Paper Company’s offices in Philadelphia. (By contrast a cotton dress from Sears cost between $5 and $10 at the time.)

The sleeveless A-shaped dresses sold much better than Scott Paper expected. By the end of 1966 the company had received nearly 500000 orders for the two patterns it offered - a red paisley print and a black and white Op-Art design.

Many Americans in the mid-1960s imagined a future defined by automation and convenience. Disposable clothing then would be a first step toward easing the burden on women’s daily lives by offering chic inexpensive dresses in an increasing variety of patterns and designs - which never needed to be (and in fact couldn’t be) laundered.

Made from three plies of “crunchy waffly-textured” paper reinforced with rayon - a new fabric termed “Duraweave” the paper dress was also treated to be fire resistant though the company warned “It is flame resistant but washing dry cleaning or soaking will make the dress dangerously flammable when dry.”

They could be easily altered. Want a shorter hemline? Just grab a pair of scissors. Tear a hole in the fabric? Fix it with some clear tape. Despite the notion that the dress was only meant to be worn once and thrown away an article from early 1966 boasted of the dresses’ continued utility long after the first wearing. “A girl might wear a Caper to her next patio party then for a few outings at the beach and then get to work with her scissors! She can cut it down to a tunic then a shell then to unusual placemats.”

It didn’t take long for other companies to capitalize on Scott Paper’s marketing campaign - and one of the most successful was based in Asheville.

Mars Manufacturing Co. located on Johnston Boulevard in West Asheville had already developed its own line of paper dresses the year before though it hadn’t sold many. But with Scott Paper’s success demand for the dresses skyrocketed and by mid-1966 Mars launched Waste Basket Boutique.

Asheville resident Bob Bayer the son-in-law of Mars’ founders began working at the company in 1960 several years before paper dresses became popular. Bayer a mechanical engineer in his 20s helped Mars - in collaboration with Kimberly Clark Corporation and J.P. Stevens - develop a prototype for disposable paper underwear for the military. Unfortunately the paper prototype didn’t hold up to the constant walking required of the troops deployed to Vietnam and would begin to flake leaving a literal paper trail in their wake.

So Bayer and another executive at Mars Ron Bard shifted to developing paper-based fashion. The paper fabric Mars used was known as Kaycel made of 93% cellulose and 7% nylon.

Unable to afford to hire a dress designer Bayer brought in his wife Audie Bayer to put together the line. “I would make a picture of a dress and cut out a piece of gift wrap and stick it on it. And I’d say to Bob ‘There. Make that’” Audie said in a 2007 interview. “It was the perfect time” she continued. “You didn’t have anybody professional who knew what they were doing. Bob didn’t know enough to argue with me.”

Audie’s design sensibilities pushed the brand to be the top paper dress producer in the United States. At peak demand Mars shipped out more than 80000 paper garments for Waste Basket Boutique each week including floor-length gowns jumpsuits coats jerseys ponchos and even men’s swim trunks. It processed not only individual orders but large orders from department stores like Macy’s Sears Lord & Taylor and J.C. Penney.

More than a utilitarian garment paper dresses became popular at parties. In December 1966 The Charlotte News reported on a “posh paper ball in Hartford Connecticut where all the female guests wore paper. Some ball gowns were from Mars others were thousand-dollar creations of famous couturiers.”

Mars also marketed a paint-your-own dress which for $6 came with a set of watercolors. According to The Charlotte News “Hostesses mail the dress and watercolors to guests with the invitations. Each female guest decorates her dress and prizes go to the most imaginative.” The article continued “A hostess in Asheville asked each woman to put on one of the plain white dresses then the husbands painted designs on them.”

During this boom period Mars Manufacturing foresaw “a day (not far off) when most of us will wear disposable clothing at least part of the time. It may be packaged in tear-off rolls like paper bags.”

But by 1969 the market had changed. As the environmental movement gained momentum the popularity of disposable fast fashion declined and hundreds of thousands of paper dresses moved from closet to waste basket to landfill without new orders being placed.

Mars Manufacturing cut its losses and shifted production to disposable industrial and surgical clothing. Bob Bayer recalled in 2007: “This paper dress thing helped us get into these other fields. It had to run out at some point.”

Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo had a sobering message for US makers of chipmaking equipment this week: you’ll need to wait as long as nine months before Washington can reach an accord with US allies over strict new rules aimed at restricting China’s access to certain technologies.

The US is working on an agreement that would make companies in the Netherlands and Japan -- home to some of the biggest makers of chipmaking gear -- subject to limits on sales of such equipment to China. US companies are already bound by the export controls which they say will cost them billions of dollars in revenue even as their main competitors in Europe and Japan face fewer limits on China sales.

Reaching the accord aimed at leveling the playing field could take six to nine months Raimondo told representatives of the US companies according to people with direct knowledge of the meeting.

Washington announced a new round of export control rules on Oct. 7 to limit China’s access to advanced chips and semiconductor-manufacturing equipment made with US technologies. Raimondo made the comments when she met representatives from equipment makers including Lam Research Corp. and KLA Corp. on Wednesday said the people who requested anonymity discussing a non-public interchange.

A spokeswoman for the US Department of Commerce declined to comment. Representatives of Lam Research and KLA did not immediately respond to requests for comments.

The global chip-production equipment market is dominated by US companies Lam KLA Applied Materials Inc. as well as ASML Holding NV in the Netherlands and Japan’s Tokyo Electron Ltd. Currently the non-US suppliers have more latitude in doing business with China. For the US triumvirate restrictions on what their overseas competitors can ship to China can’t come fast enough.



Applied Materials Lam Research and KLA have warned investors that the new export control measures will cut into their revenue. The risk for them is that -- until the restrictions apply in a more even-handed way -- foreign peers will win market share in China generating added revenue that in turn can be plowed into developing new products.

“I think there’s definitely a sense of disappointment that allies were not on board with this rule when it rolled out but a sense of urgency that they come on board soon to try and ensure that US companies don’t bleed out market share to their foreign competitors” Jimmy Goodrich vice president of global policy for the Semiconductor Industry Association said in an online discussion hosted by the Washington International Trade Association.

“That doesn’t help the US government achieve the objective it harms US industry but more importantly it does not address the national security goals because those entities of which the US government has concern over in China are still able to access that technology the US government does not want them to obtain” Goodrich said.

“So on the multilateral front that is a significant area where the private sector is watching that very closely for future developments” he said.

While the overall market for chipmaking gear will shrink next year according to estimates analysts project that the three American companies will suffer steeper revenue declines than their Japanese counterpart.

Washington is now preparing to amp up pressure on allies to block chip gear sales to China. Senior US National Security Council official Tarun Chhabra and Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security Alan Estevez are slated to travel to the Netherlands for discussions on China-chip curbs later this month Bloomberg News has reported although no deal is expected to come out of the talks.

Estevez said last week that he expects a deal with allies to be reached in the near term. He said he wants rules for American companies to be “fair with their competition across the globe and it’s fair for their competition with each other” adding that he and other officials such as National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Raimondo are talking to allies about the issue.

Friends of the Northwest Arkansas Food Bank gathered Oct. 15 at the Rogers Convention Center for the Jewels of Giving Gala -- the first one since 2019. Honorary chairmen of the fundraiser were Laura Rush Walmart Senior VP Electronics Toys Seasonal; and Stratton Sigler Unilever Sr. Director Walmart Grocery.

Kent Eikenberry NWA Food Bank president and CEO recognized Hunger Heroes named since the last gala:

• 2020 -- Northwest Arkansas Food Bank Staff;

• 2021 -- Paula Miller and Marty Adcock Food Bank volunteers; and

• 2022 -- NWA Food Bank anonymous donors.

Eikenberry updated those gathered on the nonprofit organization's $25000000 capital campaign: ""Food For Today. Hope For Tomorrow. to increase capacity and and improve services and programs through the construction of a new facility and strategic network investments.""

The group broke ground June 30 on the new Northwest Arkansas Food Bank Center for Hunger Relief at the intersection of Pleasant Grove Road and Honeysuckle Street in Lowell. ""This 82000-square-foot facility along with the investments we are making in developing more programs and investments in our partner agencies will position us to feed our neighbors for years to come.

""By the year 2025 every food insecure individual in our four-county service area will have reasonable access to nutritious food. To achieve this we will distribute 11 million meals annually.""

As of Oct. 24 the nonprofit organization has raised $22483399 toward the $25 million goal.

Last year the food bank distributed more than 14 million pounds of food and provided 11.3 million meals in Northwest Arkansas working with more than 110 partner agencies 20 mobile pantries and 19 school pantries.

Those helping boost the food bank included Emi and Tony Cardarelli Breann and Jake Cromwell Reid Hunter Elizabeth DeYoung Sarah Hampton Sarah McDaniel Youssef Elayyadi Ana Gilliland Susan Dux Mike Klaas Emily Pfeifer and Priscilla Hamel.

Danyelle Musselman and Garrett Lewis served as masters of ceremonies and helped launch the Locale fashion show to benefit the Children's Safety Center of Washington County on Oct. 20. It was hosted by First National Bank of NWA in Fayetteville.

The fashionable late afternoon fete featured exclusive looks highlighting holiday collections from local boutiques Maude Lola Skye on the Town Masons and Riffraff. Guests also had the opportunity to shop the boutiques' popup shops onsite. Organizers thanked the merchants ""for supporting our crazy idea of LOCALE and turning it into one of the hottest events of the season."" The inaugural event helped raise more than $12700 and plans are for the show to be an annual affair.

Among those supporting the safety center at the sartorial showcase were Tanya Mims Tamara Walker Mandy Macke Anne Jackson Tareneh Manning Susan Antony Taruna Bolding June Wood Lauren Cardwell Kirby Jett Charles Moon Brittany and Doug Murray Becca Brisiel Maddy Muther Leigh Laney Macy Farris Nicole Calhoun and Kristi Parrish-Mourton Caitlin Steiner Kristin Morman and Savannah Carpenter.

The KroGO carts of which Monroe has 10 have built-in scales and cameras along with a touchscreen at the handle of the cart and a credit card scanner. Shoppers using a KroGO can use reusable bags and immediately scan their grocery selections as they go.

There are some items that can’t be purchased through KroGO just yet including tobacco products hard liquor and behind-the-counter pharmacy items. Additionally the carts can only take debit or credit payments; shoppers planning to pay with cash check WIC or EBT will have to stick to standard shopping.

Once finished shoppers can pay right at their KroGO cart and then exit through the self checkout area. However the high-tech carts should be returned inside the store after use.

“They enable customers to scan groceries as they shop pay at the cart and completely skip the checkout line” Moore said.

Cincinnati-based Kroger said Monday that the 50000-square-foot spoke site at 8801 North I-35 Service Rd. in Oklahoma City recently hosted an associate celebration and ribbon-cutting event. Announced in February the new facility supports a 350000-square-foot Ocado-driven customer fulfillment center (CFC) in Dallas at the corner of 4200 Cleveland Rd. and 4241 Telephone Rd. that opened this past summer.

The Oklahoma City spoke employs approximately 190 full-time associates and serves as a last-mile cross-docking location extending the reach of Kroger Delivery service from the Dallas “hub” CFC to customers up to 200 miles away according to Kroger. Announced in September 2019 the CFC in Dallas began making its first deliveries in a soft launch this past spring.

The Kroger Co. The spoke in San Antonio which also recently held a ribbon-cutting ceremony will work with the Oklahoma City site to support Kroger's Ocado-automated CFC hub in Dallas.

Also on Monday Kroger said a 67000-square-foot spoke in northeast San Antonio recently held its grand opening. That site announced in March employees more than 160 full-time associates and along with the Oklahoma City spoke supports the CFC hub in Dallas.

“We are committed to delivering a fresh convenient customer shopping experience with zero compromise on quality selection and affordability” Bill Bennett vice president and head of e-commerce at Kroger said in a statement. “From the personalized shopping experience easy digital coupons valuable fuel points and fresh high-quality products to the refrigerated trucks trained and uniformed drivers we look forward to Oklahoma City and San Antonio customers enjoying all the benefits Kroger online shopping has to offer.”

Most recently Kroger had opened a 50000-square-foot spoke in Birmingham Ala. in September to support its Ocado-powered CFC in Forest Park Ga. The 375000-square-foot hub which officially opened in February after a soft launch in December serves the Atlanta market.

Overall Kroger has announced 12 Ocado-automated spokes of 40000 to 80000 square feet. Besides the Oklahoma City San Antonio and Birmingham sites spoke facilities are now operational in Nashville Tenn. and Maywood Ill.; Miami Tampa and Jacksonville Fla.; Lockbourne Ohio; Indianapolis; and Louisville Ky. Another spoke is slated to open in Austin Texas.

In May 2018 Kroger unveiled an exclusive U.S. partnership with U.K.-based online grocery specialist Ocado to identify sites for about 20 automated CFCs over the ensuing three years. The high-tech CFCs use Ocado’s vertical integration machine learning and robotics to fill e-grocery delivery orders and extend Kroger’s reach to a larger geographic footprint including areas where it doesn’t operate physical stores.

Thus far Kroger has announced 17 CFCs — ranging from 135000 to 375000 square feet — and six are now open. Kroger opened its first Ocado CFC a 375000-square-foot automated warehouse in April 2021 in Monroe Ohio. That was followed by 375000-square-foot CFCs in Groveland Fla. in June 2021 and in Forest Park Ga. this past February and a 340000-square-foot CFC in Pleasant Prairie Wis. in June. Most recently CFCs of 135000 and 350000 square feet went operational in Romulus Mich. and Dallas respectively. The Groveland location marked the first CFC opening in a state where Kroger generally doesn’t operate physical stores save for one Harris Teeter store in Jacksonville Fla.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vcXouY29tL3RoZS1rcm9nZXItYWxiZXJ0c29ucy1tZXJnZXItcmFpc2VzLW9uZS1iaWctcXVlc3Rpb24tdy0xODQ5Njc4NzIz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Kroger-Albertson's merger raises one big question: Why now?,"In one of the biggest deals in the history of the US grocery industry Kroger last week said that it plans to buy rival Albertsons for $24.6 billion.

The deal will allow Kroger to better compete with Walmart which is the biggest player in the industry owning some 22% of the US grocery market. Commanding greater market share will allow Kroger to better negotiate better rates with suppliers and invest more in technology to reduce costs. If combined Kroger and Albertsons would make up 13% of the US grocery sales and reach some 85 million households across the US.

Kroger said it would buy Albertsons for $34.10 a share in cash which is above Albertsons’s stock price of $27.20 as of this writing suggesting that investors do not think a deal between two big supermarkets will pass regulatory scrutiny.

It’s tough to make money in a low-margin business particularly as the industry has gotten more competitive with new players from Uber to Target offering food or selling more of it. “That drives people to eventually say I need to get bigger” said Ken Fenyo the president of research at Coresight Research and a former executive at Kroger.

But the merger also comes during a time when the public spotlight is on soaring inflation and federal regulators are scrutinizing big mergers marking an unusual moment for the grocery industry.

The $24.6 billion deal comes during a time of regulatory scrutiny

Under the Biden administration the Federal Trade Commission has more than doubled its letters of investigation over mergers or similar transactions in 2021 versus the year before which has surfaced in the food delivery industry.

The merger is facing backlash across the political spectrum including Utah Republican senator Mike Lee and senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders a Democrat and and an Independent who say that the combined power of two major grocers will lead to higher prices for customers.

Kroger and Albertsons which operate stores in overlapping regions said they will sell up to 375 stores to receive clearance from regulators. The deal is expected to close in early 2024 pending regulatory approval.

Private equity is looking to unload

As part of the deal Albertsons will pay a cash dividend of up to $4 billion to its shareholders. The biggest shareholder of Albertsons is Cerberus Capital which has owned a controlling stake in Albertson’s since 2006. Albertsons held on unusually long rather than selling to “ultimately seek out an attractive offer from one of the few larger grocers that still remain” wrote Tim Clarke a senior PE analyst at PitchBook in an email. In other words Cerberus is looking to squeeze more profits for shareholders from a low-margin business.

Kroger wants to keep up with online grocers like Walmart Amazon

Both Walmart and Amazon are part of a very competitive environment particularly around e-commerce. “You could go back probably five years ago pre-pandemic when you could probably ignore e-commerce or at least do a deal with Instacart” said Fenyo. “But the game has really changed.”

During the pandemic many supermarkets added pick-up and delivery infrastructure to meet the demand for online shopping. But those costs add up. “E-commerce has put a lot of pressure on the profitability and operating costs of the retailer” he said. One way for these firms to reduce costs is to merge which will give them scale to be more efficient.

Amazon’s share in the grocery business including Whole Foods is in the low single digits but the company has been expanding its checkout-less technology including cashier-less stores and using a palm print to pay for groceries. “Right now everyone’s focused on what’s Amazon doing what’s Walmart doing and how do I position myself to be competitive you know the next three five or even 10 years” Fenyo said.

With the takeover of Albertsons Kroger will have more data on customers which will help create more personalized shopping experiences. “I think that really puts a lot of pressure on retailers in grocery frankly in any industry to make this a specialty” he said. “And it’s really something a lot of retailers haven’t invested in don’t really necessarily have the capabilities they’re going to need to compete in what’s really going to be increasingly a data-driven business.”

The merger will address rising inflation

The Russia-Ukraine war and the pandemic have led to skyrocketing food prices which affects grocers as well as shoppers. Scaling allows Kroger to better negotiate supply chain relationships and to invest in technology to run a more efficient operation.

“The whole industry is squeezed now because the prices they pay suppliers rise. And the question is to what extent they can roll it over to customers” said Yakov Amihud a professor at NYU Stern. “And of course the weakened ability to really deliver to customers their margins are squeezed. The result is that their profitability can decline.”

To cut costs Walmart is looking to own more of the supply chain. In August it invested in a beef supplier which allows it to have more control over pricing.

Whether the merger will raise grocery prices or lower them is up for debate. On a conference call with analysts and investors this week Kroger said they plan to invest $500 million in reducing prices. But regulators and consumer advocates say with more market power comes more control over pricing and that companies can simply redirect any increase in profits to shareholders rather than bringing down monthly grocery bills for shoppers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxnYnRxbmF0aW9uLmNvbS8yMDIyLzExL2tyb2dlci1zZXR0bGVzLXdvcmtlcnMtc2F5LWZpcmVkLWNvbXBsYWluaW5nLXVuaWZvcm0tZW5kb3JzZWQtcHJpZGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kroger settles with workers who say they were fired for complaining that the uniform endorsed Pride,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxnYnRxbmF0aW9uLmNvbS8yMDIyLzExL2tyb2dlci1zZXR0bGVzLXdvcmtlcnMtc2F5LWZpcmVkLWNvbXBsYWluaW5nLXVuaWZvcm0tZW5kb3JzZWQtcHJpZGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF1ED0EE0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxnYnRxbmF0aW9uLmNvbS8yMDIyLzExL2tyb2dlci1zZXR0bGVzLXdvcmtlcnMtc2F5LWZpcmVkLWNvbXBsYWluaW5nLXVuaWZvcm0tZW5kb3JzZWQtcHJpZGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL25ld3MvNjYxOTg0MS9rcm9nZXItcGF5cy10aG91c2FuZHMtdW5pZm9ybXMtZW1wbG95ZWVzLWNvbnRyb3ZlcnNpYWwtbG9nby_SAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGUtc3VuLmNvbS9uZXdzLzY2MTk4NDEva3JvZ2VyLXBheXMtdGhvdXNhbmRzLXVuaWZvcm1zLWVtcGxveWVlcy1jb250cm92ZXJzaWFsLWxvZ28vYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kroger pays out thousands in row over uniforms after employees who complained about ‘controversial logo’ we...,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL25ld3MvNjYxOTg0MS9rcm9nZXItcGF5cy10aG91c2FuZHMtdW5pZm9ybXMtZW1wbG95ZWVzLWNvbnRyb3ZlcnNpYWwtbG9nby_SAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGUtc3VuLmNvbS9uZXdzLzY2MTk4NDEva3JvZ2VyLXBheXMtdGhvdXNhbmRzLXVuaWZvcm1zLWVtcGxveWVlcy1jb250cm92ZXJzaWFsLWxvZ28vYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF1ED1A50>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL25ld3MvNjYxOTg0MS9rcm9nZXItcGF5cy10aG91c2FuZHMtdW5pZm9ybXMtZW1wbG95ZWVzLWNvbnRyb3ZlcnNpYWwtbG9nby_SAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGUtc3VuLmNvbS9uZXdzLzY2MTk4NDEva3JvZ2VyLXBheXMtdGhvdXNhbmRzLXVuaWZvcm1zLWVtcGxveWVlcy1jb250cm92ZXJzaWFsLWxvZ28vYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo had a sobering message for US makers of chipmaking equipment this week: you’ll need to wait as long as nine months before Washington can reach an accord with US allies over strict new rules aimed at restricting China’s access to certain technologies.

The US is working on an agreement that would make companies in the Netherlands and Japan -- home to some of the biggest makers of chipmaking gear -- subject to limits on sales of such equipment to China. US companies are already bound by the export controls which they say will cost them billions of dollars in revenue even as their main competitors in Europe and Japan face fewer limits on China sales.

Reaching the accord aimed at leveling the playing field could take six to nine months Raimondo told representatives of the US companies according to people with direct knowledge of the meeting.

Washington announced a new round of export control rules on Oct. 7 to limit China’s access to advanced chips and semiconductor-manufacturing equipment made with US technologies. Raimondo made the comments when she met representatives from equipment makers including Lam Research Corp. and KLA Corp. on Wednesday said the people who requested anonymity discussing a non-public interchange.

A spokeswoman for the US Department of Commerce declined to comment. Representatives of Lam Research and KLA did not immediately respond to requests for comments.

The global chip-production equipment market is dominated by US companies Lam KLA Applied Materials Inc. as well as ASML Holding NV in the Netherlands and Japan’s Tokyo Electron Ltd. Currently the non-US suppliers have more latitude in doing business with China. For the US triumvirate restrictions on what their overseas competitors can ship to China can’t come fast enough.



Applied Materials Lam Research and KLA have warned investors that the new export control measures will cut into their revenue. The risk for them is that -- until the restrictions apply in a more even-handed way -- foreign peers will win market share in China generating added revenue that in turn can be plowed into developing new products.

“I think there’s definitely a sense of disappointment that allies were not on board with this rule when it rolled out but a sense of urgency that they come on board soon to try and ensure that US companies don’t bleed out market share to their foreign competitors” Jimmy Goodrich vice president of global policy for the Semiconductor Industry Association said in an online discussion hosted by the Washington International Trade Association.

“That doesn’t help the US government achieve the objective it harms US industry but more importantly it does not address the national security goals because those entities of which the US government has concern over in China are still able to access that technology the US government does not want them to obtain” Goodrich said.

“So on the multilateral front that is a significant area where the private sector is watching that very closely for future developments” he said.

While the overall market for chipmaking gear will shrink next year according to estimates analysts project that the three American companies will suffer steeper revenue declines than their Japanese counterpart.

Washington is now preparing to amp up pressure on allies to block chip gear sales to China. Senior US National Security Council official Tarun Chhabra and Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security Alan Estevez are slated to travel to the Netherlands for discussions on China-chip curbs later this month Bloomberg News has reported although no deal is expected to come out of the talks.

Estevez said last week that he expects a deal with allies to be reached in the near term. He said he wants rules for American companies to be “fair with their competition across the globe and it’s fair for their competition with each other” adding that he and other officials such as National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Raimondo are talking to allies about the issue.

Associate Professor of Chemistry Max Majireck Christie Lam ’25 and Chrissy Crespo ’25 presented a poster titled “Bench-stable 2-halopyridinium ketene hemiaminals – new reagents for simple synthesis of bioactive 2-aminopyridines.” Their presentation described a new method for synthesizing 2-aminopyridines a versatile class of bioactive compounds found within many drugs.

Crespo said it was exciting to share her own piece of Professor Majireck’s larger research project. “It was motivating and inspiring to see students professors and researchers of all degrees getting excited about the atomic-level workings of the universe” said Crespo who added that she appreciated her professor “for offering me such a wonderful opportunity to present my research so early on in my undergraduate career.”

Also presenting at the ACS meeting were Assistant Professor of Chemistry Wes Kramer and Frank Valoy ’23 who gave an oral presentation titled “Development of ROMP polymers to support and enhance electrocatalytic CO2 reduction by cobalt phthalocyanine.”

The presentation described the team’s efforts toward developing a catalyst-embedded polymer that could chemically reduce carbon dioxide into other products an industrially important process with environmental benefits. Beyond industry the project also has implications for recycling CO2 produced by burning fossil fuels which makes it relevant for climate change mitigation strategies Kramer said.

“It’s rare for an undergraduate student to be alongside their professor to present the progress made in their research” said Valoy a chemistry major with a minor in theatre whose talk was based on research he conducted at Hamilton in the summer of 2021. He advises other students who are given the chance to present research “to take advantage of the opportunity and do it. Opportunities like this are a chance to get out of your comfort zone and try something not only exciting but new.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5taXQuZWR1LzIwMjIvdXBuYW5vLWpvaW5zLW1pdG5hbm8tY29uc29ydGl1bS0xMTA30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UpNano joins MIT.nano Consortium | MIT News | Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"MIT.nano has announced that UpNano US Inc. a company that manufactures and supplies high-precision and high-resolution 3D printing instruments for academia and industry has joined the MIT.nano Consortium. This engagement initially planned for two years will include locating one of UpNano’s NanoOne 1000 instruments in MIT.nano.

“We’re thrilled to welcome UpNano to the MIT.nano Consortium” says Vladimir Bulović the founding faculty director of MIT.nano and the Fariborz Maseeh (1990) Professor of Emerging Technology. “Not only is UpNano’s 3D printing technology an exciting addition to MIT.nano’s growing toolsets but the company brings a global perspective on academic research and industry application that will be immensely valuable to the MIT.nano community and our consortium members.”

UpNano US Inc. is the Boston-based U.S. subsidiary of UpNano GmbH. Headquartered in Vienna Austria the company is a global distributor of 2-photon polymerization-based (2PP) 3D printers.

The NanoOne platform includes a compact multiphoton lithography device with custom control software that supports a range of photopolymer materials. This system combines the high precision of 2PP with the possibility to dynamically change the dimensions of the focal point on demand. The result is a printer that is both high resolution (producing feature sizes from 150 nanometers to 40 millimeters) and quick (up to 100 times more rapid than other 2PP systems). The speed of the system supports faster prototyping shorter development cycles and even small-scale serial production.

Additionally an UpNano application scientist will be stationed at MIT.nano this fall to support research activities including training use of the NanoOne 1000 and collaboration with MIT researchers.

“UpNano is very excited to provide support to the important scientific mission of MIT.nano and affiliated researchers” says Bernhard Küenburg co-founder and CEO of UpNano. “From next-generation display materials and micro-scale systems for biological study to new material and design options for microelectronic devices MIT researchers are at the forefront of many of the world’s most urgent challenges. We look forward to working with them to extend this research to even smaller dimensions and enable them to continue to push the boundaries of what is possible.”

In MIT.nano’s quarterly industry consortium meetings UpNano will provide advice to help guide and advance nanoscale innovations at MIT alongside the 10 other consortium companies:

Analog Devices

Draper

Edwards

Fujikura

IBM Research

Lam Research

NC

NEC

Oxford Instruments/Asylum Research

Andrew W Scott Vice Chairman and CEO of Power 50 organizers Inside Asian Gaming said “After 14 years in Macau it was a big decision to move the Asian Gaming Power 50 Gala Dinner to another country for the first time but holding the 15th annual event here in the Philippines was a spectacular success. We were absolutely delighted with the support we received from the resort industry in the Philippines and the people of the Philippines. Everyone has gone out of their way to help us with moving the host city of this international event to Manila.

“It’s becoming much tougher for an international industry like ours to operate in China including Macau. At the same time all levels of the Philippines government seem to be letting the world know that the country is ‘open for business’. It was an honor to have Congressman Edwin Olivarez representing the First District of Parañaque — the home of Entertainment City — present the trophy for the number 1 position. We couldn’t be happier and the Philippines has made a strong case for us staying here for next year’s event.”

First published by IAG in 2008 the Asian Gaming Power 50 has become renowned as the definitive guide to the most influential people in the Asian gaming industry.

Regarding the four main incentives covered by this article they are not true incentives as the word is generally understood. Instead they are credits for fees that have already been paid or are benefits not uncommonly extended for significant building projects.

The full question

Before this year’s primary I asked candidates for Reno mayor whether they thought the influence of developers on the city council should be increased decreased or stay the same.

Mayor Hillary Schieve responded “I think there's been a lot of perception out there – especially like with Jacobs – that he had all these incentives and he hasn't. He paid market rate for everything. There haven't been these big incentives.”

Jacobs is Jeff Jacobs CEO of Jacobs Entertainment.

A reader wrote recently asking how Schieve’s response squared with a passage from a This Is Reno story a year ago about a development agreement for the massive Neon Line District that would reshape downtown:

Jacobs Entertainment will get millions in financial incentives. According to city staff incentives include: Pedestrian amenity credits not to exceed $4658516.

Sewer connection fee credit extensions not to exceed $1568261.

Building permit and sewer connection fee deferrals: 5-year payment schedule.

Residential Construction Tax: collected funds to be spent within the District during the first 5 years of the Agreement.

The development agreement itself – approved by the city council on a 6-to-1 vote – specifically says “The reason for this Agreement is to secure certain financial incentives…”

The reader said the RGJ should've challenged Schieve’s comment that “There haven’t been these big incentives.”

About the Jacobs agreement

The Neon Line District is a huge development effort that includes a $300 million remodel of the Sands Regency a festival ground a proposed amphitheater several apartments and a condominium development.

The district would be bordered by Interstate 80 on the north Keystone Avenue on the west West Second Street on the south and West Street on the east. It comprises parts of Reno’s Entertainment District and Northwest District.

The effort started in 2017 when Jacobs bought the Sands Regency and then many other properties in the Fourth Street corridor including a number of blighted motels that were then demolished.

In a recent phone call with the RGJ Reno City Manager Doug Thornley described the Neon Line District agreement as not being final because of a lawsuit by the conservation group Scenic Nevada over an archway and two signs that would promote the district.

Even if the signs are blocked Thornley believes the rest of the agreement will move forward.

“We'll see what happens with the litigation but there's no reason for it to go back to the city council” for another vote he said.

Incentive #1 – pedestrian amenities

The Jacobs agreement includes “pedestrian amenity credits.”

Reno’s municipal code requires that 1% of a big project’s value be spent on pedestrian amenities that make the space more accessible or interesting for people on foot.

When a developer pulls permits to start building the city imposes this fee. Jacobs sought credit for pedestrian amenities he's already built within the district so he doesn't pay again when Neon Line construction begins in earnest.

Thornley said city staff recently finished assessing what Jacobs claims as pedestrian amenities along the frontages of his properties.

“They essentially have a credit book of $2.3 million toward the value of any code-required pedestrian amenities because they’ve already put it in” he said adding that the expenses were verified with receipts.

In other words the city says that although the written development agreement calls this an incentive it’s not really one because Jacobs is merely making sure he gets credit for something he already paid for.

Shashi Nambisan agrees that these pedestrian amenity credits are not incentives in the traditional sense.

He is a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Nevada Las Vegas and heads the school’s Transportation Research Center.

“We may call it an incentive but I think it is more an impact fee that the developer is paying” he said. “Since the developer has already incurred the cost it is a credit that the city was willing to consider.”

Incentive #2 – sewer credit extensions

When developers build new projects that connect to the sewer system they pay for each connection to cover the cost of its impact on treatment facilities.

When developers tear down buildings for which sewer connections were already paid they get credit for those existing connections because they are already figured into the calculus of what the pipes and treatment plants can handle.

“What this agreement does is it memorializes a dollar value for those sewer connections” Thornley said about the buildings Jacobs has torn down. “It says you have this many dollars’ worth of sewer connections already paid.”

Over time sewer connection fees often go up in cost. If a developer tore down buildings with 1000 sewer connections worth say $1 million those connections might be worth $2 million in 10 years.

The Neon Line agreement says Jacobs gets up to $1.5 million in sewer connection fee credits and no more.

Thornley does not consider that an incentive. “All this does"" he said ""is preserve the value of connection fees already paid.""

Incentive #3 – fee deferrals

Those sewer connection fee credits are not good forever. The city gives a time limit to start construction and reconnect to the sewer lines so developers are inspired to build more quickly and not sit on vacant lots.

The typical agreement with area builders is that they last five years Thornley said.

“The (Jacobs) development agreement preserves these sewer credits for a little longer than five years but starts to phase them out if they're not used” he said.

The building permit fee deferral is the same concept. In the agreement Jacobs gets up to five years to pay sewer and building permit fees.

“This is available to everyone – it's not a Jacobs specific thing” Thornley said. “There are a number of fees that you can defer until such time as the building is finished.”

Such deferrals are available outside of Reno in Sparks and parts of Washoe County.

“It helps the development community manage cash flow” he said.

“It’s not a waiver from or relief from paying the fee. You still pay the fee you just pay it at the time the building permit gets finalized (but before the building can be used) as opposed to when you come in and pick up a building permit in the first place.”

City council member Jenny Brekhus – the lone vote against the Neon Line agreement – said she views these extensions as special treatment for Jacobs.

“I know I have to pay my sewer fee by a certain day or I get a real big penalty” she said. “I think developers should have to pay their sewer fees on time too.

Incentive #4 – residential construction tax

The city collects a residential construction tax from developers to pay for new parks in districts defined by the parks department. The funds can also be used for the complete rehab of a park but not for simple upgrades or park maintenance.

An example Thornley gave was that if a large new housing development was built in Reno’s Old Southwest the construction tax for parks would need to be spent within the Old Southwest.

The city maintains control over those park funds and what is built. It also owns the parks built from construction taxes.

“The distinction here is the narrowing of the area in which that money will be invested” Thornley said of the Jacobs agreement. “The residential construction tax collected will stay within the district as defined by the development agreement versus the slightly more broad district as defined by the parks department.”

To be clear Jacobs is paying the same amount in residential construction taxes. However he gets a benefit: the beautifying presence of a city-built and city-maintained park within his Neon Line District.

Brekhus views this as a perk for Jacobs.

“He's been able to have the privilege of putting it within his area rather than the parks department saying ‘Oh no we needed it over here within this larger community boundary’” she said.

Thornley said “What the developer is trying to do there and I think what the city council is trying to do there is say ‘Look this is a thing in which we want to be invested a space that we want to be successful and we want there to be room for everyone in the community. So we want to ensure that there are public spaces that are inviting and intriguing to folks and that they come down and see what's going on inside this design space.’”

Nambisan said that this type of “variation of the process … is not uncommon” adding that if the city maintains ownership of the park he doesn’t see it as a true incentive but instead like other impact fees that pay for sidewalks in the public good within a development area.

Privileges

Brekhus thinks Jacobs got additional special privileges.

Although he paid market rate for city properties she said they were sold to him “in a noncompetitive manner.”

Also Jacobs was given alleys within the proposed Neon Line District through a process called abandonment. They had been city property.

Thornley said when large-scale aggregation of properties – buying a bunch of connected parcels – happens it makes sense to allow alley abandonments. This way the land can then be “redivided in a way that makes more sense through the lens of the current project.”

No tax breaks

I contacted the National League of Cities – a nonpartisan advocacy group that includes all major cities and towns in Nevada – to see what it considers an incentive for developers.

The group sent me to an article from Plante Moran one of the world’s largest accounting and wealth management firms: “What developers need to know about economic development incentives.”

None of the incentives the article describes are like those for Jacobs.

The article focuses on tax breaks for developers such as $28 million in tax relief given as part of a deal for Fiat Chrysler to build a Jeep plant in the Detroit area. Those are not part of the Jacobs deal.

Conclusion

Jacobs has locked in credits for expenses he’s already incurred. He’s gotten deferrals that allow him to pay certain fees after construction rather than before. And he’s paying for a park that will be within his Neon Line District.

These are privileges or perks. They do not seem like true incentives such as those that have caused problems for other cities where developers have gotten millions in tax breaks or received taxpayer funds through grants to lower their own building costs.

Critics’ concerns will be justified if Jacobs uses the city’s perks to flip the properties he’s bought for a profit rather than developing them into the proposed Neon Line District. Even then though it seems unfair to call these benefits by the word “incentives.”

Leidos Australia employees traveled 57 kilometers and raised nearly AU$20000 (roughly $12000) for Australian veterans during Bravery Trek 2022 a virtual fundraising event where volunteers have 30 days to walk swim cycle or wheelchair a similar distance of an iconic military related route.

Organizers hope to raise AU$100000 (roughly $64000) in support of Bravery Trust a nonprofit that provides financial relief and counseling to Australian veterans experiencing physical and mental health challenges as a result of their service.

Why you should know: A recent study shows nearly half of Australian military veterans suffer from a mental disorder. Mental illness can limit a veteran’s earning capacity and lead to financial hardship according to Bravery Trust.

Bravery Trust has provided more than $7 million of urgent financial aid to 6000 families over the last decade. Nearly 70% of those who reach out to Bravery Trust for assistance are under the age of 50.

Leidos impact: As the founding sponsor of the Trek volunteers from Leidos Australia helped plan and execute the 2022 campaign. To launch the event Leidos Australia VP Murray Bruce and Event Coordinator Hannah Stock joined nine other runners to complete a 57 kilometer course around Sydney Harbor passing through four major naval bases. The course serves as the virtual trek volunteers use to track their progress.

Bruce said he ran in honor of a close friend who served in Afghanistan and sadly took his own life last year.

From the sources:

“The challenges he faced following his service got to be too much” says Bruce. “People dig themselves into a hole and can't dig their way out. We want our vets to have the courage to reach out when they need help. The financial relief and counselling Bravery Trust provides can help prevent issues from escalating before it’s too late.”

“Bravery Trek has become a collaborative event showcasing the amazing things that can happen when corporations and charities align” says Bravery Trust CEO Belinda Wilson. “True partnership is more than a donation and we are sincerely grateful for the gift of support we continue to receive from Leidos.”

In addition to supporting the Trek each year Leidos Australia makes a corporate donation to the Bravery Trust. Over the past six years the company has donated nearly AU$350000.

Credit: Sung Jin Cho / Unsplash.

Cleveland Hopkins International Airport (CLE) in the US has deployed the Terminal Flight Data Manager (TFDM) system from Leidos to minimise runway departure queues.

Developed for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) TFDM is claimed to streamline operations in the air traffic control (ATC) tower of the airport.

Leidos Transportation Solutions senior vice-president Fran Hill said: “With an increase in air traffic nationwide it’s crucial for airports to leverage the most innovative systems and technology to keep airport traffic consistently flowing.

“The benefits of TFDM are far-reaching. Not only will it improve the passenger experience by reducing delays but it will also lower greenhouse gas emissions through reduced aeroplane taxi times.”

A tower-based Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) system TFDM enhances surface management and efficiency stated the technology firm.

It provides electronic data to controllers as well as air traffic managers aircraft operators and airports to stage arrivals and departures while handling surface traffic flow.

According to D6 Supervisor Matt Dorsey rumors of San Francisco’s death are greatly exaggerated

by Carol Harvey

Housing is in trouble nationwide. Kick this up a notch in the City and County of San Francisco. The formerly popular city itself is in jeopardy.

You can watch more of Dorsey’s Coffee at this link: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHrKWOo7hlZCFS8kiXhHYicr7WZ6GPcRW

“San Francisco has been mismanaged” said Lotus Yee Fong at Dorsey’s Sept. 29 coffee event. “There is a great deal of corruption and therefore housing homelessness and mental health issues are out of control.”

She recognized “how the City really works. And we’re not saying that other cities don’t have it too – but San Francisco has kind of reached the very end of the corruption scale.”

She continued “In the old days – it’s not like it was perfect. But it was kind of normal-sized corruption.

“But now this City – this is Global Finance Central for the Asian stock markets right? And the money that is in their elections for each candidate and proposition or whatever – we don’t have the say the control about how things are.”

Homelessness and the fentanyl crisis drives tourists and potential condo owners away

San Francisco is filled with citizens in tents ranged along sidewalks next to desperate fentanyl hawkers and people dead from drug overdoses. This has given the City a reputation as a place where as Fong put it “conventions and tourists don’t necessarily want to come. Also the tech bubble has burst so companies are moving out of the City and the state.

“The convention business has started coming back to a small degree but not like it used to be. And the mental health and homeless issues – the reputation is everywhere now so people don’t want to come to San Francisco anymore.”

The center of the centerpiece

The Treasure Island-Yerba Buena Island development project is crucially important to the City and County of San Francisco. Developers were counting on the huge project at Yerba Buena and Treasure Island standing as a centerpiece of new housing some of it affordable. At the center of the centerpiece are the astronomically priced Yerba Buena Island condos.

Because San Francisco’s reputation is so damaged “They’re having trouble selling those condos” asserted Fong.

“Also” she said “They overbuild.

“There are too many residential and commercial (buildings) at high rates and they are not filling them. That’s why the people with money are in trouble.”

The assumption has been that the YBI condos will be bought up by rich Chinese.

Fong cautioned “You can’t be planning for people who aren’t even going to live here. We have to look at the big picture and the big strings.” Referring to “the new money in the city” she said “a lot of wealthy people don’t want to live here. This is just going to be a pied-a-terre the French call it. You own real estate in many places and that’s where you put your assets your money.”

A pied-a-terre is a house or apartment kept for occasional use. For years fabulously wealthy families have maintained pied-a-terres on Russian Hill and in Pacific Heights that they visit while passing through.

‘The Residences at Yerba Buena Island

You can visit The Bristol at this link:

Inside the lobby at 724 Battery St. in the glassed-off sales office of The Residences at Yerba Buena Island one can view a model displaying an enormous condominium complex covering the entire crown of the natural island.

Recently we circled the steep incline to the Bristol at the top. The only completed condo the Bristol can be seen looming gray and white over Treasure Island facing the Golden Gate Bridge and out to sea.

We were surprised by how easy it was to get inside – how eagerly the staff greeted us giving us much-appreciated little chocolates.

Tom Gasbarre sales manager of the Residences at Yerba Buena Island met us on the sidewalk in front of The Bristol and ushered us – me with my camera rolling – through the accessible front doors into the lobby.

He readily shared key information.

“There’ll be 266 homes here (on Yerba Buena Island); 124 in The Bristol Condominiums.”

Mr. Gasbarre pointed across the street to two additional “product types” under construction one called The Townhomes; the other called The Flats. The Flats contain seven residences per building. A fourth clutch of condos named Courtyard Townhomes is being built on the opposite City side of the island over the hill next to a one-acre off-leash dog park.

On a map he indicated “a six-acre park at the top of the island” the sand beach down along Clipper Cove and “a ferry service that connects the islands to the Embarcadero Ferry Building.”

The planning is lavish.

“The architect who did the exteriors of the buildings and the layout of the community is Hart-Howerton” a local design firm at 1 Union St. Third Floor San Francisco.

“The interiors of this building (The Bristol) were done by Edmunds and Lee Associates” based in the Mission District at 2601 Mission Suite 503.

“And the interiors of The Townhomes and Flats will be done by Meyer Davis” a prestigious interior design firm based in New York City.

Gasbarre verified what we knew that the developer for all the 266 homes in the Yerba Buena Island build-out is Wilson-Meany. Wilson-Meany and Lennar are doing a joint venture on Treasure Island consisting of 7700 homes.

He told us Yerba Buena Island studios start at $185000 – one bedrooms at a million.

“They planned it and built it when they thought that they could fill it” said Fong “and nobody’s coming.”

These are examples of the mansions that will be built on five “Estate Homesites” on the island.

Treasure Island is really going to be carrying a lot of the City’s housing promise

At his Sept. 29 Coffee Dorsey discussed the vital importance of the Treasure Island-Yerba Buena Island project.

“There is state law” he said “that requires municipalities to update their general plan every eight years. It’s a portion of the General Plan called the Housing Element.” And the Housing Element is “the strategy for how municipalities are going to take steps to build housing and actually facilitate the production of housing including affordable housing levels.

“There’s a number that comes out every eight years called the RHNA (pronounced RENA)” or “sometimes called ‘the RHNA targets’ or ‘RHNA minimums’ because it’s a minimum floor.”

The acronym RHNA “stands for Regional Housing Needs Allocation. San Francisco’s RHNA allocation is 82069 units. Treasure Island represents about a little under 10 percent of the entire goal (for the whole City of San Francisco). So this is a really important part of that.

“I’m going to be committed to fulfilling the promise of meeting our RHNA targets” Dorsey vowed. “And the reason is because the state law has changed and under state law currently if San Francisco (actually if any municipality) doesn’t make its targets they risk the loss of state funding for affordable housing for transit and then possibly the loss of local control altogether.”

As a result said Dorsey “if the state were to take local control away it means that everything is by right.

“The definition of ‘by right’ is that development may proceed under a zoning ordinance or by law without the need for a special permit (or) ordinance.

“If it (the project) meets the building codes and zoning you’re in – you’re good. There’s no discretionary review whatsoever.

“So I’m going to be doing everything I can as a member of the Board of Supervisors to be what I’ve said is ‘The Conscience of Housing’ on the board. That means I’ll support more housing in my district. But I’m going to support housing in everybody else’s district as well.

“Because the reality is if we get punished and we lose state funding for affordable housing (and) for transit our district gets hurt the most. District 6 is going to get hurt the most.

“Treasure Island is really going to be carrying a lot of this because literally 10 percent of the goal – or a little under 10 percent – is going to be here on the island.”

$115000 to $15000 parking spots

During our Bristol visit I mentioned to Tom Gasbarre that we heard they were charging $115000 for a parking spot associated with the Yerba Buena complex. “Is that true?” I asked.

Gasbarre explained that every new development in San Francisco mandates that the parking is sold independent of the residences.

“So that is correct. The cost of the parking space is $115000.”

“That brings the price up a tad” fellow visitor Lois Scott joked.

“A little bit” said Gasbarre wryly.

“Right now they (the City) has mandated any new construction sold in San Francisco – the parking is sold independent of the residence.

“Ours is less than most at $115000. Most of them are $150000 for parking – or more.”

Some of the most ambitious residential housing endeavors in history

At his coffee event Matt Dorsey insisted “I think we have to do everything we can to take care of housing” which meant that he supports a massive amount of new construction.

“We are about to embark on some of the most ambitious residential housing endeavors in history – since World War II anyway.” It appeared he was referring specifically to the 7700 new homes on Treasure Island in addition to the 266 Yerba Buena Island condos totaling 7926. The stated purpose is to jump the population of the islands from 1300 to 1800 souls to 20000 more people.

However at his Sept. 29 Coffee several attendees described San Francisco as “dead.”

Dorsey countered by joking “Rumors of its death are greatly exaggerated.”

Let’s hope he’s right.

The historic venue is one of the two major outdoor arenas in the New York metropolitan area. It has hosted music talents such as songwriter Jimmy Buffet Grammy Award winner James Taylor and rock band Aerosmith.

“New Yorkers have visited the historic Northwell Health at Jones Beach Theater for years to see their favorite artist perform and this investment will fund critical improvements to this iconic venue” Gov. Kathy Hochul said.

This renovation is estimated to take five years with the main goal to significantly improve the concert-view experience. These improvements include installing new entrances building a new plaza for local food and beverage stands remodeling all restrooms improving resilience from high tides and upgrading seats and restrooms.

In addition the Jones Beach Theater will receive new entrance gates under a canopy roof structure a new plaza for food vendors and more quality enhancements. Sustainability improvements will also be made; as a focus on green operations such as: Zero Waste Stations elimination of plastic straws water refill stations and a composting program will be added.

This project is spear-headed by a partnership between New York State and Live Nation Entertainment the entertainment company funding the project.

“Our plans for the Northwell Health at Jones Beach Theater will add even more modern conveniences that fans enjoy while staying true to the character of this historic venue” Tom See chief operating officer of Live Nation’s Venue Nation said.

The renovation seems to be well received by many as it has historical value to the locals within the community.

This project came to be under the New York State Park’s 20-year operating agreement with Live Nation Entertainment. This agreement seems to come to be not only for the entertainment purposes but also the economic purposes.

“A staple within the Long Island community for decades these improvements will not only ensure greater enjoyability of the venue during events they will also encourage tourism and create much-needed job openings – both of which will in turn help stimulate our economy” State Senator John Brooks said.

The theater is able to seat 14500 people and with these improvements the quality of the experience will greatly improve. Some tout the commitment and dedication of Live Nation entertainment to always improve the experience including screen digital video boards and expanding menu items.

The exact cost and details of the project is not specified but what is known is the first arounds of work are estimated to complete prior to next summer. With the efforts of New York State and Live Nation Entertainment the optimism from the improvements will ensure the Jones Beach State Park venue remains a top entertainment destination for another generation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8va3BvcGNvbmNlcnRzLmNvbS9rLXBvcC1jb25jZXJ0cy90b3VyLXRyb3Qtc2luZ2VyLXlvdW5ndGFrLXRvLWVtYmFyay1vbi10YWstc2hvdy11cy10b3VyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"[TOUR] Trot Singer Youngtak to Embark on ""TAK SHOW"" US Tour","Following his second-place win on Mr. Trot highly-acclaimed Korean trot singer Youngtak is embarking on his first-ever headline tour in the U.S.!

An investment expenditure draft previously adopted by the Balkan nation’s budget and finance committee details a plan for the second batch of F-16s amounting to almost $1.3 billion.

“If we do not sign a contract for the second eight aircraft we will not be able to service the first eight because the first contract lacks spare parts and ammunition” said Bulgarian Defense Minister Dimitar Stoyanov.

The government official underscored the importance of Bulgaria having a full squadron of 16 F-16 Block 70 jets to safeguard its airspace.

Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) is under contract to equip the Bulgarian air force with the first batch of the multipurpose fighters by 2025. The aircraft is designed for regional and global air policing and is employed by other U.S. allies which could open opportunities for joint exercises and several military cooperation efforts.

The aerospace giant has invested USD 100 million in the company concluding a cooperation agreement on the development and sale of small satellites until 2035.

Approximately 95% of Terran Orbital’s orders are related to the Ministry of Defense and NASA

Lockheed Martin acquired debt obligations and shares of the manufacturer. Terran shares rose 2.3% during trading and closed at USD 2.62 per share after jumping 33% earlier in the day. Since the beginning of the year the shares have fallen by more than 70%.

Terran also announced that the investment will help build a huge USD 300 million spacecraft manufacturing plant in Irvine California and not in Florida as originally planned. CEO Mark Bell told the press that the company decided to move the plant to California. The abandonment of the Florida plant turned out to be a big loss for Space Florida the state’s economic development agency dealing with the aerospace industry which was going to provide financing for the plant.

Terran Orbital and the US Department of Defense

Terran Orbital located in Boca Raton Florida designs and builds satellites for the U.S. government and commercial clients. Approximately 95% of the company’s orders are related to the Ministry of Defense and NASA.

Lockheed Martin made its first investment in Terran back in 2017. The following year the company received an investment of USD 36 million. New funds from Lockheed will be used to purchase additional assembly areas and increase the production of satellite modules. The small satellite manufacturer said it plans to expand its offering to include a line of synthetic aperture satellite radars as well as satellite components and assemblies such as reaction wheels and star trackers.

Initially the company planned to launch and use its SAR satellite group called PredaSAR but decided to abandon these plans and offer the technology as a product. Terran Orbital said the war in Ukraine demonstrated the importance of advanced satellite imagery.

Adopting the newly announced Red Hat Device Edge (see related news below) will enable Lockheed Martin to support U.S. national security missions by applying and standardizing AI technologies in geographically constrained environments.

With Red Hat Device Edge the companies are equipping U.S. military platforms such as the Stalker unmanned aerial system (UAS) with advanced software that was previously too large and complex for these systems. This advanced software enables small platforms to handle large AI workloads increasing their capability in the field and driving faster data-backed decision making.

In a recent demonstration Lockheed Martin used Red Hat Device Edge on a Stalker UAS to demonstrate how AI-enhanced sensing can advance joint all-domain operations. The Stalker used onboard sensors and AI to adapt in real-time to a threat environment.

The Stalker was flying an intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) mission to detect a simulated military target. Once the Stalker detected the target emitter project engineers used Red Hat Device Edge to update the Stalker’s software in-flight.

The new software — now managed on platform by Red Hat Device Edge — enabled the Stalker to deploy updated AI-based computer vision capabilities also known as automated target recognition capabilities. As a result Stalker was able to classify the military target providing more useful ISR data and enhancing the situational awareness of the threat environment more accurately.

Lockheed Martin Red Hat and other industry collaborators are enhancing 5G.MIL capabilities with RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) functionality using Red Hat OpenShift the industry’s leading Kubernetes platform to deliver resilient communications for the U.S. Department of Defense.

Lockheed Martin is a key contributor to the MicroShift project collaborating to help build out the project’s edge capabilities for remote and inaccessible environments. As part of Lockheed Martin’s 21st century security vision to leverage the best commercial technologies for the defense industry the company plans to continue to innovate using Red Hat Device Edge and edge Kubernetes capabilities for a broader range of applications across all domains: land sea air space and cyber.

In related news Red Hat introduced Red Hat Device Edge a solution for flexibly deploying traditional or containerized workloads on small devices such as robots IoT gateways points of sale public transport and more.

“Innovation at the edge has introduced new benefits and use cases for organizations across all industries – but it has also created new challenges” says Francis Chow vice president and general manager of in-vehicle operating systems and edge at Red Hat.

“Working with our customers and partners Red Hat began a journey to develop a new technology offering — designed specifically for the edge — extending our hybrid cloud solution so that our ecosystem will be able to take advantage of intelligence paired with trusted open-source technology to tackle their smallest footprint remote edge use cases. Tested in the community now produced by Red Hat Red Hat Device Edge is a major next step in harnessing the full range of benefits promised by edge computing.”

Red Hat Device Edge delivers an enterprise-ready and supported distribution of the Red Hat-led open source community project MicroShift a lightweight Kubernetes orchestration solution built from the edge capabilities of Red Hat OpenShift along with an edge-optimized operating system built from Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

This latest product in the Red Hat edge portfolio aims to provide a future-proof platform that allows organizations’ architecture to evolve as their workload strategy changes. As more and more companies deploy edge computing across a broader range of use cases many new questions operational needs and business challenges are poised to arise

In industries like automotive manufacturing and more organizations are up against different environmental security. and operational challenges that require an ability to work with small form-factor edge devices in these resource constrained environments. Ultimately different devices have different requirements in terms of computing power software compatibility and security footprint.

Kubernetes built for edge deployments enables IT teams to use familiar Kubernetes features in a new smaller lighter-weight footprint offered by MicroShift. This lowers the barrier of entry for teams building cloud-native applications for edge computing environments and enables them to use existing Kubernetes skills to achieve greater consistency of operations across the entirety of the hybrid cloud from the datacenter to public clouds to the edge.

The edge-optimized Linux OS built from the world’s leading enterprise Linux platform in Red Hat Enterprise Linux is tailored for small edge devices with intelligent updates that use minimum bandwidth. This helps organizations tackle the challenges of intermittent connectivity while mitigating the impact on edge innovation.

IT teams can use zero-touch provisioning system health visibility and updates with automatic rollbacks to maintain a stronger edge management and application security posture.

Red Hat Device Edge was created to help Red Hat customers and partners tackle their most challenging edge environments. For example Lockheed Martin has been collaborating with Red Hat in the MicroShift project community and is also working to deploy Red Hat Device Edge to modernize and standardize its application delivery and AI workloads in extreme conditions including wildland fire management contested military environments and space.

Additionally ABB is planning to use Red Hat Device Edge for ABB Ability Edgenius on resource constrained devices. Edgenius is a comprehensive edge platform for industrial software applications.

Red Hat Device Edge will be aimed at organizations who require small factor edge devices with support for bare metal virtualized or containerized applications regardless of industry. Additional use cases include but are not limited to:

Miniature connected nodes on public transportation where edge devices are often in motion but still need faster processing via AI/ML to analyze data locally in real time.

Resilient resource nodes at challenging locations like weather monitoring stations where in spite of the harsh tough-to-support environments an edge device will still be capable of taking care of itself with the ability to perform automated software rollbacks maintain a stronger security posture and better enforce sensitive data controls.

Emerging edge constrained scenarios where thousands of edge devices may be running applications in locations that make weight temperature and connectivity all major concerns.

Red Hat Device Edge meets organizations wherever they are today in their edge computing journey as it will run a wide variety of workloads using Podman for edge container management or MicroShift for a Kubernetes API. Customers will even be able to use legacy windows applications within a virtual machine.

Red Hat Device Edge is planned as a developer preview early next year and expected to be generally available with full support later in 2023.

The demonstration simulated missions including an 83-mile autonomous medical resupply carrying 400 units of real and simulated blood delivery of a 2600-pound external load attached to a 40-foot sling and rerouting mid-flight to evacuate a casualty. The flights which were performed by a Black Hawk equipped with Sikorsky’s MATRIX autonomy technology aimed to “show how existing and future piloted utility helicopters could one day fly complex missions in reduced crew or autonomous mode.”

“We believe MATRIX technology is ready now for transition to the Army as they look to modernize the enduring helicopter fleet and acquire Future Vertical Lift aircraft” said Sikorsky Innovations director Igor Cherepinsky. “In addition to increasing flight safety and reliability MATRIX technology enables survivability in high tempo high threat 21st Century Security environments where Black Hawk helicopters operate today and DEFIANT X and RAIDER X helicopters could operate in the future. Uncrewed or reduced crewed helicopters could safely perform critical and lifesaving missions day or night in complex terrain and in contested battlespace.”

The demonstration flights were performed last month as part of the Army’s Project Convergence 2022 (PC22) experiment. A second series of uncrewed Black Hawk flights is planned for later this year. In addition to military applications Sikorsky is looking at using the technology for civilian operations such as firefighting cargo delivery and urban air mobility."

Canada’s hardware landscape appears headed for a shakeup as Lowe’s Cos. Inc. LOW-N exits the market with rival groups already positioning themselves to sign on Rona dealers who decide to cut ties with the banner.

Mooresville N.C.-based Lowe’s said last week it struck a deal to sell its Canadian operations to New York private-equity firm Sycamore Partners for US$400-million in cash plus unspecified performance-based benefits. The agreement will mark the end of a frustrating multiyear run in Canada for Lowe’s during which it struggled to make Rona sufficiently profitable.

Sycamore will take over about 450 stores including 70 Lowe’s big-box stores and some 150 corporate-owned Rona stores as well as the wholesale business supplying 210 independent Rona dealers. Many of those independent dealers are expected to end their contracts with Lowe’s Canada and look for new hardware and building-materials buying groups to ally themselves with such as Castle Building Centres Group Ltd. Groupe BMR Inc. or Home Hardware Stores Ltd.

“It’s going to be shark week” said Michael McLarney a hardware industry specialist who runs trade publication Hardlines. “The other groups are going to be circling trying to get these Rona dealers to convert.”

Behind the scenes the jostling has already started. And it reflects the view by many hardware business owners that a private investment firm is not necessarily the best partner during a time of economic upheaval as they tend not to be long-term owners. After a two-year period during which the industry in Canada benefited from a surge in home renovations during the COVID-19 pandemic hardware retailers are now resetting sales forecasts and bracing for a recession.

Castle has heard in recent days from several Rona independent dealers with whom it has engaged in past conversations about joining the member-owned co-operative said Ken Jenkins Castle’s president and chief executive officer. He said anxiety among Rona dealers under Lowe’s has been on the rise amid that company’s difficulties in Canada and that this could be a tipping point for many to join rival groups.

“Independents are somewhat slow to change but I do see heading into 2023 as this deal finalizes that there will be an early exodus of a number of their dealers” Mr. Jenkins said adding Castle intends to take advantage of the expected decampment to expand its own footprint from the current 330 stores. “We will be heavily engaged in that opportunity in the months to come.”

Groupe BMR is also in expansion mode. The chain which currently has some 275 renovation centres and hardware stores in Quebec Ontario and the Atlantic provinces is “obviously listening and open to discussions” with dealers from Rona and other competing banners said BMR communications director Kaven Delarosbil.

Valérie Gonzalo a spokesperson for Lowe’s Canada said the company believes the sale will have minimal impact on its relationship with Rona dealers. Sycamore is strongly committed to the dealer network as “an integral part of our Canadian business model” she said. The new owners also support the implementation of Lowe’s Canada’s existing growth plan she said.

Existing Lowe’s-branded stores in Canada will eventually adopt the Rona banner Ms. Gonzalo said. Sycamore intends to keep the head office of Lowe’s Canada in Boucherville Que. and maintain the chain’s commitment to Canadian and Quebec-based suppliers.

This isn’t the first investment by Sycamore Partners in Canada. The firm took over U.S. office-supply chain Staples Inc. in 2017 for US$6.9-billion including its Canadian stores. On its website Sycamore says its strategy is to partner with management teams to improve the operating profitability and strategic value of their businesses.

Lowe’s entered the Canadian market in 2007 and made a hostile attempt to buy Rona in 2012 that was rejected by the company as well as the Quebec government. The U.S. giant initially failed to understand the political and public sensitivity in the province to a foreign takeover. The company came back with a sweetened offer in 2016 and won Rona for US$2.4-billion ($3.2-billion based on the exchange rate at the time).

Quebec Premier François Legault’s Coalition Avenir Québec government struck a note of resignation in accepting this latest change of control for Rona.

“I would have liked it to be sold to Quebeckers but the damage was done in 2016” Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon told Montreal’s La Presse newspaper last week. Sycamore has a horizon of five to seven years he says. “Our role is to work with Quebec interests so that we’re ready when they sell.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Saunas were invented over 2000 years ago in Finland where they were used as a method of bathing to clean the body according to Northern Lights Hot Tubs & Saunas. Although we have showers in our homes now saunas are still a popular way to promote health and relaxation.

Medical News Today states that saunas work by improving blood circulation which may offer the same benefits as moderate exercise. The heat and humidity in saunas can help ease the pain of arthritis and loosen joints and muscles. While there is no definitive proof that the regular use of a sauna improves heart health in a Finnish study participants were 22% less likely to die suddenly of a heart-related issue when they used a sauna up to three times a week. Whether you are hoping to reap the potential health benefits of a sauna or are just wanting to add a place to relax to your home we can tell you which store has the best deal."

You need to get over your reclining seat rage,"Editor’s Note: Heather Poole is a flight attendant for a major US carrier and author of “Cruising Attitude: Tales of Crashpads Crew Drama and Crazy Passengers at 30000 Feet.” The views in this commentary are her own. Read more CNN Opinion.

CNN —

Last night on a flight from London to New York a passenger rang his call light and when my colleague walked over turned off the light and asked him if he needed something he simply pointed to the reclined seat in front of him.

Heather Poole courtesy Heather Poole

The flight attendant told him that his seat was also in the reclined position and then mentioned that the seat next to him — the aisle seat — was available and that he could sit there. The man said he didn’t want to move to the aisle seat because he wanted to sit by the window.

Sometimes there are no solutions to problems like this.

Another day another flight: “If you put your seat back one more time I’m going to punch you in the face” said an older woman to a teenage girl seated in front of her. The young girl’s eyes looked like they might pop out of their sockets.

While standing in the aisle pouring a can of Diet Coke into a cup of ice I told the aggrieved passenger that nobody was going to punch anyone and that if she said another word about it or did anything to anyone authorities would be called to meet the flight.

“He’s in my lap!” cried a different passenger on a different flight. This one sat in the window seat.

I looked at the woman and then at the man in front who was clearly not in her lap. He was close though about a foot away. Sorry I mouthed. I handed her a can of club soda and a cup of ice and communicated to her in words I knew she’d understand: “Unfortunately he’s allowed to be in your lap.”

Besides lack of wifi or a broken entertainment system flight attendants hear more complaints about reclined seats than anything else.

The heart of the problem is that airlines are packing too many seats too closely together into a tight space. Remember legroom? But this squeeze doesn’t give passengers the right to react in such a way that the crew feels the need to divert a flight to have a passenger removed. That’s a really big deal that usually ends up with someone in police custody.

While I dread these altercations I think some passengers need to chill out — people have the right to recline their seat. Nobody has to ask for permission to recline their seat. Some people believe passengers have to put their seats in the upright position during the meal service. This isn’t true. At least not with US carriers even though it’s a nice thing to do.

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. Heather Poole

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. If you kick the seat or threaten to punch someone in the face you’ll be the one removed from the flight — not the person who moved their seat back two inches.

Not all airlines are created equal. Yes some airlines are taking away the recline option on all seats but these are mostly low-cost carriers which should tell you something about what those passengers want: cheap flights … including seats that don’t recline. (A friend who often flies Air France on short and medium-hop routes in Europe tells me that their seats are all locked upright. “I’ve never seen anyone get worked up about it” he said.)

Airlines are desperate to cut costs. It’s rumored that American Airlines removed a single olive off of business class meal trays and saved $40000 a year. So you’d think that 150 lighter seats per flight will certainly save an airline a ton of money. Remember the recline mechanism in the seat makes it heavier which increases fuel costs for the airline. A lighter seat that doesn’t recline is also a seat that is less likely to break which saves an airline money in repairs.

Non-reclining seats are nothing new. Major carriers have always had a few seats that don’t recline. Think exit rows and the last row. While some passengers aren’t always happy to get one of these seats it never seems to be that big of a deal.

But after 28 years in the job I’ve found there’s some basic reclining etiquette that makes for a smoother flight for everyone.

A reminder: chances are the person in front of you has no idea they’ve crossed that mental barrier between you and the rest of the world. You can’t kick them or scream at them but you can politely ask if they’d mind putting their seat back up. I bet if you ask nicely they’ll do it.

If you’re a passenger who likes to recline it’s always a good idea to be mindful of the situation that we are all collectively in and do so slowly. Yanking the seat back too quickly could make a mess if the person behind you has their tray table down.

Sure everyone feels cramped in coach seats. But the bigger you are the tighter the squeeze so consider glancing back before you adjust your seat. If it’s Shaquille O’Neal behind you maybe give the guy a break.

We do see spilled drinks and from time to time broken laptops. Seasoned business passengers know what to expect and book seats with more legroom. But on coach middle seat passengers struggle to type because there’s no arm space. The table is so much smaller these days and there’s barely room for a drink. So if you think you’re going to work on your laptop and balance a cup of coffee on that table well you might need to seriously rethink your spatial judgement.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned flying the unfriendly skies it’s this: you can’t please everyone. Somebody is going to suffer somebody is going to have a miserable flight somebody will be assigned the last row or a middle seat or will have to come into contact with a child. Now I’m going to tell you what I used to tell my son when he was little every time we traveled together: there’s no crying in flying. Toughen up.

Really this isn’t a war on reclined seats. This is about space and most airlines give you the option to purchase more space. So remember that next time you’re searching for the cheapest flight.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvZmxvcmlkYS1hLW0tYmFja3MtYXdheS1mcm9tLWR1YmlvdXMtMjM3bS1kb25hdGlvbi0wMDE1NzIzNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Florida HBCU backs away from dubious $237M donation,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvZmxvcmlkYS1hLW0tYmFja3MtYXdheS1mcm9tLWR1YmlvdXMtMjM3bS1kb25hdGlvbi0wMDE1NzIzNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF2624D60>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvZmxvcmlkYS1hLW0tYmFja3MtYXdheS1mcm9tLWR1YmlvdXMtMjM3bS1kb25hdGlvbi0wMDE1NzIzNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvYm94LW9mZmljZS1raW5nZG9tLW9mLXRoZS1wbGFuZXQtb2YtdGhlLWFwZXMtMTIzNTkxMTExOC_SAVlodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1L2JveC1vZmZpY2Uta2luZ2RvbS1vZi10aGUtcGxhbmV0LW9mLXRoZS1hcGVzLTEyMzU5MTExMTgvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes’ Solid Previews Around $6M – Thursday Night Box Office,"EXCLUSIVE: Sources tell us that 20th Century Studios‘ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is off to a good start with previews around $6.5M. That’s comprised of Thursday night money which began accruing at 3PM and around $1.6M from Wednesday fan shows that began at 7PM.

We’ll know tomorrow AM if it’s the best Thursday night ever for an Apes movie besting 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes which did $5M on its preview night before a $22.1M Friday and $56.2M opening. This Wes Ball directed PG-13 sequel takes place 300 years after the events of Matt Reeves’ War for the Planet of the Apes.

Already Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes‘ Thursday has bested that of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes’ which did $4.25M before minting a $27.6M Friday and massive 3-day of $72.6M still a record domestic debut for the Apes‘ franchise.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ is 82% on Rotten Tomatoes with critics and 82% with RT audiences.

Tonight’s results are a bit of fresh air next to the $3.15M Wednesday and Thursday previews of Universal’s Fall Guy last weekend which fizzled with a $27.7M opening. While fans always populate Thursday night shows hopefully Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes at a 2 hours and 25 minutes running time can hold it together throughout the weekend.

Hands down tonight it’s the best preview cash for a Ball movie beating all of his Maze Runner titles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2RhdmlkYXhlLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvYS11a3JhaW5pYW4tbS0yLWZpZ2h0aW5nLXZlaGljbGUtc25lYWtlZC11cC1vbi1hLXJ1c3NpYW4tdC04MC10YW5rLWF0LW5pZ2h0LWFuZC1oaXQtaXQtd2l0aC1hLW1pc3NpbGUtZnJvbS1hLW1pbGUtYXdheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Ukrainian M-2 Sneaked Up On A Russian Tank—And Hit From A Mile Away,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2024/05/08/a-ukrainian-m-2-fighting-vehicle-sneaked-up-on-a-russian-t-80-tank-at-night-and-hit-it-with-a-missile-from-a-mile-away/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2RhdmlkYXhlLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvYS11a3JhaW5pYW4tbS0yLWZpZ2h0aW5nLXZlaGljbGUtc25lYWtlZC11cC1vbi1hLXJ1c3NpYW4tdC04MC10YW5rLWF0LW5pZ2h0LWFuZC1oaXQtaXQtd2l0aC1hLW1pc3NpbGUtZnJvbS1hLW1pbGUtYXdheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Cows and pumpjacks lined the roadsides.

All looked placid. But when Wilson flipped on a high-tech video camera a disquieting image became visible: A long black plume poured from a flare pipe. Her camera designed to detect hydrocarbons had revealed what appeared to be a stream of methane — a potent climate-warming gas gushing from the very equipment that is supposed to prevent such emissions.

“It’s very discouraging and depressing but mostly it’s infuriating” said Wilson a field advocate for Earthworks which promotes alternatives to fossil fuels. “Our government is not taking the action that needs to be taken.”

Methane is the main ingredient in natural gas. Measured over a 20-year period scientists say it packs about 80 times the climate-warming power of carbon dioxide. And according to the International Energy Agency methane is to blame for roughly 30% of the global warming that has occurred since the Industrial Revolution. Aerial surveys have documented huge amounts of methane wafting from oil and gas fields in the United States and beyond.

It’s a problem the Biden administration has sought to attack in its recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act. One of the law’s provisions threatens fines of up to $1500 per ton of methane released to be imposed against the worst polluters. Perhaps most crucially the law provides $1.55 billion in funding for companies to upgrade equipment to more effectively contain emissions — equipment that could in theory help the operators avoid fines.

Yet some of the best equipment for reducing emissions is already installed on oil and gas infrastructure including at the BP site that Wilson filmed. And critics say such equipment is failing to capture much of the methane and casting doubt on whether the Biden plan would go far to correct the problem.

What Wilson saw at the BP site was an unlit flare. It’s among the types of equipment the EPA recommends companies consider installing to reduce methane emissions. Resembling a tall pipe a flare is supposed to burn off methane before it can escape. Flames typically burn from the top of the flares.

But in this case the flame had gone out so methane was pouring from the pipe. The flare’s mechanisms are supposed to alert the operator if it stopped working. That didn’t happen in this case according to a report by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

“Energy companies have made pledges but I’ve got to tell you I haven’t seen anything from a practical standpoint that makes me believe there’s any reality to reductions on the ground” said Tim Doty an environmental scientist and former air quality inspector for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. “Maybe they’re making progress but are they making enough progress to slow down climate change? I don’t think so.”

The spewing methane that Wilson detected was among more than a dozen such scenes she documented over three days in the Eagle Ford Shale an oil and gas field in south Texas. The methane poured from unlit or broken flares storage tanks vapor recovery units and compressors. She found it escaping at sites owned by companies including BP and Marathon Oil both of which have pledged to reduce methane emissions.

“They have the technology but for some reason whether they don’t maintain it whether the technology doesn’t work I don’t know but if find it not working” Wilson said.

BP did not respond to questions about the methane leaks Wilson documented. The company says it plans to eliminate routine flaring in U.S. onshore operations by 2025 and is advocating for policies to reduce methane emissions.

Marathon Oil disputed that it violated any regulations. A spokeswoman said the company recognizes the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the global climate and prioritizes concern for the environment.

Sometimes methane escapes because the equipment designed to contain it hasn’t been properly calibrated or maintained. Emissions aren’t immediately stopped once new equipment is installed. Companies must still invest in properly designing the system and continuously monitoring and maintaining the equipment. This requires money and staff which experts say many companies neglect.

The Biden administration hasn’t yet specified which types of equipment it recommends. But the EPA which is working with the administration on the law’s methane reduction program has recommended technologies for reducing methane emissions. Whether that equipment actually succeeds in capping emissions is an open question.

“There’s lots of technologies but the reality in the field is it just doesn’t work” Doty said.

That’s frequently also the case with another type of equipment the EPA recommends: vapor recovery units. These are systems of pipes and seals that are supposed to capture methane before it can escape from tanks. In Doty’s field work which spans decades he estimates that he’s seen vapor recovery units leaking some amount of methane or other hydrocarbons 75% to 85% of the time.

And hydrocarbons like methane because they are corrosive inevitably degrade the tanks pipes and equipment that are supposed to contain them.

“All this stuff is going to be prone to leak — that’s just the way it is” said Coyne Gibson who spent about two decades as an engineer inspecting oil and gas equipment. “That’s mechanics. And there’s there’s not really any way to avoid it.”

One reason it’s hard for the industry to control methane emissions is that many leaks come from the nation’s vast gas distribution network. Millions of miles of pipelines are next to impossible to completely monitor. What’s more Gibson said pipelines are often buried making leaks harder to detect.

That gas distribution network which includes pipelines and compressor stations is responsible for most methane emissions in the energy industry said Antoine Halff chief analyst at Kayrros an energy analytics company. Using satellite data Kayrros identified one compressor station — which adjusts the pressure of gas to move it through pipelines — that emitted methane continuously for eight days.

“It’s way too common” Halff said.

Some large companies have invested in infrared cameras like Wilson’s that can detect methane leaks at facilities. They use them on the ground or on drones or aircraft.

The process can help operators find and fix leaks. But it’s typically done only periodically with cameras that don’t run continuously. Every few months some companies will send a team with an infrared camera to check for leaks from the ground or a helicopter.

Much of the time though there is no such surveillance. Leaks or even planned methane releases can occur during these periods as when companies open a stretch of pipeline to release methane before doing repairs. The staffing it would take to continuously survey the nation’s 3 million miles of natural gas pipelines would likely be prohibitively expensive.

Malfunctioning flares like the one Wilson found are also a major contributor to methane pollution. Flaring is supposed to burn off 98% of the methane that would otherwise shoot directly into the atmosphere. But whether because of malfunctions or poor design flares are releasing five times that amount of methane into the atmosphere according to a study by the University of Michigan.

“Flares often go out” said David Lyon senior scientist with Environmental Defense Fund. “They’ll be unlit and venting all the gas. Or they’ll just not be burning the gas properly. So that’s that’s a really big source of methane. And often I think the operators are not aware that the flare’s out.”

The Environmental Protection Agency is writing rules on methane reduction that will further detail what would be required of companies starting in 2024 under the Inflation Reduction Act.

The American Petroleum Institute the main lobbying group for the oil and gas industry says methane emissions intensity declined by nearly 60 percent across the nation’s major producing regions from 2011 to 2020. But companies base their reported methane emissions on estimates not actual measurements another custom that the Inflation Reduction Act seeks to change.

Climate scientists have shown using satellite data that methane emissions are often two or three times above what companies reported. Under the new law companies would have to actually measure and report their methane emissions. But it’s still unclear how such a measurement program would work.

“Us and many others in this field over and over again have shown the huge gap between reporting by countries and companies and what can actually be detected” Halff said.

Even so he thinks there’s reason to hope that the methane provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act will make some difference.

“Emissions keep going up” he said. “We’re moving in the wrong direction…but the potential the conditions to change course seem to be here.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmplcnNleXNob3Jlb25saW5lLmNvbS9tYW5jaGVzdGVyL2xha2VodXJzdC03LWVsZXZlbi1wYXJ0LW9mLW5hdGlvbndpZGUtY2xvc3VyZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lakehurst 7-Eleven Part Of Nationwide Closures,"LAKEHURST – It is getting tougher and tougher to find a 7-Eleven convenience store in Ocean County. Within the last few years at least four closed their doors and now the borough’s long-time 7-Eleven has done the same.

The franchise closed its Route 70 location as part of a plan to sell 18 7-Eleven and Speedway stores in the state. The plan involves selling some stores and closing others.

The Speedway stores that 7-Eleven acquired from Hess Corporation’s retail operations from Marathon Oil in 2021 are also are being sold off. They include one at 1741 Hooper Avenue in Toms River Washington Hackettstown and Pennsauken.

7-Eleven stores will close in Scotch Plains Newark Butler Elwood Park and Hackettstown. Stores in Barnegat and Holmdel are also up for sale.

According to NJBiz.com 7-Eleven based in Texas has 13000 stores in North America. There are 370 in New Jersey. The franchise is seeking to sublease some of the locations and bids were due in on the first of this month.

Across the nation 7-Eleven is selling 73 of its stores in 22 states. The locations will be sold through a “buy one some or all” process minus convenience store branding. The sales and leases which include the property as well are being run by NRC Realty and Capital Advisers.

The franchise has been facing stiff competition by one if its major competitors Wawa over the last few decades. A Wawa store is currently being built near the Lakehurst circle at Lilac Street and Union Avenue near Route 70.

Wawa has 277 locations in the Garden State and around 981 overall. Brick Township will see its sixth Wawa soon.

Another competitor QuickChek has approximately 160 stores across New Jersey and New York. QuickChek has plans to add more stores in the future.

The Lakehurst 7-Eleven hasn’t had much traffic and shut down this past week as part of the company’s downsizing plan. The franchise is considered the largest convenience store chain in the country. There were signs inside store to inform regular customers that the store was ending its tenure in the borough noting that “everything must go.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sYXcuY29tL2FtZXJpY2FubGF3eWVyLzIwMjIvMTEvMDcvZGVhbC13YXRjaC1jcmF2YXRoLWRhdmlzLXBvbGstc2MtYW5kLXNpbXBzb24tYW1vbmctZmlybXMtbWFraW5nLWhheS1pbi1iYW5uZXItd2Vlay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Deal Watch: Cravath Davis Polk S&C and Simpson Among Firms Making Hay in Banner Week | The American Lawyer,"What happened last week?

ALEXANDRIA Va.—Select Marathon-branded gas stations are piloting a new and improved loyalty program called Marathon Rewards. The new program which will replace the MakeItCount Rewards platform is expected to launch chainwide by the end of the year.

“Customer loyalty is integral to the Marathon Brand” said John Rice brand marketing and commerce manager. “This upgrade is a component of our broader Marathon Brand strategy which includes the recently launched Endurance Image and our new Marathon Insight mystery shop program currently under development.”

Marathon Rewards is designed to enhance the retail consumer experience according to the company. The program allows customers to earn a five-cent reward per gallon of fuel and they can earn rewards on select in-store purchases and additional third-party offers. Rewards can be redeemed on qualifying fuel purchases and the program kicks off with a $5 reward incentive for new member-related activities.

Marathon Rewards is powered by Stuzo’s Open Commerce product suite.

“Stuzo is excited to partner with Marathon to bring the all-new Marathon Rewards program to market” said Jake Kiser chief customer officer Stuzo. “Marathon Rewards utilizes Stuzo’s patent-pending Wallet Steering System which drives incremental shares of fuel and merchandise to jobbers and dealer networks.”

This summer Marathon Petroleum Corporation revealed new branding for Marathon.

“Remaining true to our heritage you will still see the familiar red white and blue colors reconfigured into a bolder more contemporary design” said Rice. “Updated dimensional elements such as a retooled logo channel letters and illumination will capture attention both day and night. The new image also features ‘Endurance Fuels’ to underscore Marathon’s enduring commitment to provide consumers with high-quality fuels.”

According to recent Paytonix research c-store loyalty members annually spend 38% more on average while fuel visits increased by 8% in 2021 when a customer is a loyalty member. Also the most loyal c-store customers are visiting businesses one or more times per day.

TXB recently launched a custom app which allows customers to earn and save on gas purchases. Also Mars is launching a loyalty experience by partnering with Fetch a consumer-rewards app. The program will allow consumers to earn rewards points for purchasing select Mars products.

NACS has published a free report on how convenience retailers can build loyalty program affinity beyond rewards and provides insights on c-store loyalty programs shopper expectations program engagement personalization and program access/communication.

NACS also offered a free webinar that shows retailers how to improve their current loyalty program.

But companies base their reported methane emissions on estimates not actual measurements another custom that the Inflation Reduction Act seeks to change.

Climate scientists have shown using satellite data that methane emissions are often two or three times above what companies reported. Under the new law companies would have to actually measure and report their methane emissions. But it’s still unclear how such a measurement program would work.

“Us and many others in this field over and over again have shown the huge gap between reporting by countries and companies and what can actually be detected” Halff said.

Even so he thinks there’s reason to hope that the methane provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act will make some difference.

“Emissions keep going up” he said. “We’re moving in the wrong direction…but the potential the conditions to change course seem to be here.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwZWVkb250aGV3YXRlci5jb20vdGhlLWVuZC1vZi1vbmUtZXJhLW9wZW5zLWFub3RoZXItaG9vay1hbmQtbHVjYXMtb2lsLXBhcnRpbmctd2F5cy_SAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5zcGVlZG9udGhld2F0ZXIuY29tL3RoZS1lbmQtb2Ytb25lLWVyYS1vcGVucy1hbm90aGVyLWhvb2stYW5kLWx1Y2FzLW9pbC1wYXJ0aW5nLXdheXMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The End Of One Era Opens Another—Hook And Lucas Oil Parting Ways,"For more than two decades Nigel Hook a gentleman offshore powerboat racer from the United Kingdom who lives in Southern California has been the public face of Lucas Oil in the sport. And for the 22 years the company could not have had finer representation. As charismatic as he is competitive Hook remained a consummate professional throughout offshore racing’s assorted up and downs while competing in 18 countries on four continents.

Fans in Key West Fla. today for the upcoming offshore world championships will notice something different about Nigel Hook’s 52-footer during this evening’s parade down Duval Street—it will carry Ocean Cup livery. Photo by Pete Boden copyright Shoot 2 Thrill Pix.

But when his Extreme-class 52-foot Mystic Powerboats catamaran shows up in Key West Fla. this weekend for next week’s Race World Offshore-produced event the Lucas Oil name will be gone from its deck and hullsides. Instead it will be badged with Ocean Cup the American Power Boat Association/Union Internationale Motonautique-sanctioned offshore endurance series Hook has been spearheading for years.

Sponsored through the Lucas Oil Ambassador program the team’s contract ends this year. Renewal is not on the table as the petroleum products company has been making cuts to that program.

“There are mixed emotions seeing a new livery on the boat because I am tremendously grateful to Lucas Oil” Hook said. “It has been incredible to promote a product that evokes a universally positive response.”

Dressed in its new graphics Nigel Hook’s 52-footer was a hit with fans during today’s raceboat parade in Key West Fla.

Running predominantly red boats Hook’s teams have earned multiple national championships a pair of world championships and have established six UIM world speed records including a Guinness World Record from Key West Fla. to Havana Cuba. His raceboats have included 37- and 43-foot Scarab V-bottoms 39- and 41-foot Outerlimits V-bottoms a 41-foot Vector V-bottom a 48-foot SilverHook V-bottom a 40-foot Skater Powerboats catamaran and his current 52-foot Mystic cat.

Said Hook “I would like to thank Forrest Charlotte Morgan Katie and indeed the whole Lucas Oil organization for such a great relationship and for their contributions to our joint successes.”

Whether it’s fees to cover the light bulbs in your room extra charges to cover a hotel’s property tax or gotcha charges for paying a bill by credit card (even Marriott’s own credit card).

Still a fee per night that guests now have to pay to protect housekeepers at the Marriott LAX still surprised me. (HT: One Mile at a Time)

Please note – A daily Hotel Worker Protection Ordinance Costs Surcharge-local fee of USD 10.72 plus tax will be added to the room rate.

Marriott’s Renaissance LAX also charges a similar fee but $8.70 per night. This is justified by a Los Angeles rule requiring:

Hotels to provide employees with panic buttons for their safety at work mostly in case they’re attacked by a guest. Marriott is charging you to protect workers from you .

. New overtime rules including written consent from the worker for shifts over 10 hours.

As Ben Schlappig writes

At 100% occupancy this fee would amount to nearly $4 million per year so if that’s really necessary to pay for these panic buttons then I need to get into the panic button business! …how exactly was the pre-tax total of $10.72 per night decided? It’s almost like the hotel is trying to make it sound like something very exact so it comes across as a government fee rather than the hotel using this to pad its bottom line.

These hotels do not believe the safety of their employees is their responsibility. It’s something you have to pay for in addition to the price of your room. And it’s something you have to pay the hotel to do since they appear to be charging more than it costs them. In other words it’s a junk fee designed for deception to extract more money from guests. It’s a destination fee by another name but without any benefit to the guest.

Why does Marriott allow this? I suspect that this fee actually isn’t permitted under Marriott’s rules (whether or not they’re enforced). To charge a resort or destination fee a Marriott hotel must have an above-average intent to recommend score and offer benefits to the customer in exchange “with a retail value that is at least four times greater than the destination or resort fee charged.”

If that restriction has any meaning a hotel can’t just call an add-on fee something else in order to avoid it and in order to avoid an application fee (e.g. $1500 plus $550 per year after approval).

Nonetheless guests are the product not the customer hotels do as they please or at least have learned to test boundaries since Marriott has been degrading its brand to keep owners happy. Owners free ride on the Marriott name while not contributing to preserve it and they’ve more or less gotten away with this since the Starwood acquisition in order to keep them in the fold and paying fees. So they think they can get away with most things at this point whether Marriott ultimately pushes back on this specific charge or not.

Ultimately this is bad for Marriott because they’ll only be able to earn these fees as long as the brand has value. And it’s bad for Marriott hotels generally because it reduces their differentiation with Airbnb and makes them less competitive. But in the short run it benefits individual hotel properties that appear to offer cheaper rooms when a customer is searching and because some consumers may not realize how much they’re going to have to pay.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vbG95YWx0eWxvYmJ5LmNvbS8yMDIyLzExLzA3L3R3by1sYXgtYXJlYS1tYXJyaW90dC1ob3RlbHMtaW50cm9kdWNlLW5ldy1qdW5rLWZlZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Two LAX Area Marriott Hotels Introduce New Junk Fee,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://loyaltylobby.com/2022/11/07/two-lax-area-marriott-hotels-introduce-new-junk-fee/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vbG95YWx0eWxvYmJ5LmNvbS8yMDIyLzExLzA3L3R3by1sYXgtYXJlYS1tYXJyaW90dC1ob3RlbHMtaW50cm9kdWNlLW5ldy1qdW5rLWZlZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

After more than two years of navigating different dimensions and phases of the COVID-19 crisis concerns over inflation affordability and national debt are front of mind for businesses according to the World Economic Forum’s 2022 Executive Opinion Survey (EOS).

Executives were asked to identify the risks they considered the biggest threats to their country over the next two years. The responses from more than 12500 executives across 122 economies reflect a clear unease about economic headwinds against a backdrop of aggravated geopolitical tensions.

Although a true comparison with last year’s results isn’t possible owing to changes in the list of risks presented “infectious diseases” has plummeted as a concern despite new variants of COVID-19 and periodic surges in case numbers; cost-based challenges trump concerns about growth and employment; and cross-border friction is now perceived as more of a threat than domestic stability within countries except for a notable elevation of concern about “state collapse” in certain emerging market countries.

All Eyes on the Economy

With growth in many large economies stalling and debts mounting “rapid and/or sustained inflation” and “debt crises” featured among the top 10 risks in every region with the former being top-ranked in Europe Latin America and the Caribbean and East Asia and the Pacific. Public finances were already strained due to the pandemic but governments globally are continuing to face fiscal pressure. Just last month national debt in the U.S. reached a record high of $31 trillion.

Respondents to this year’s survey have shared concerns about commodity prices and supply. Reverberations of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have exposed commodity dependencies and spurred governments to reassess trade relations. With a conflict-driven energy crisis underway and multiple countries facing key shortages of grain cooking oil and fertilizer commodity-related challenges are top-ranked for leaders in both emerging markets and advanced economies. The risks of “severe commodity price shocks or volatility” and “severe commodity supply crises” featured among top-five risks in North America Europe Middle East and North Africa and Central Asia.

Economic precarity threatens to cause knock-on societal impacts in both advanced economies and emerging markets with “cost of living crisis” ranked as a top-two risk for executives in seven out of eight regions. For emerging markets unemployment remains a key barrier to growth as those countries struggle to restore the millions of jobs lost during the past two years and tackle the rise of the informal economy.

A Tense Geopolitical Landscape

Reflecting the multiple instances of conflict and strained international relations “geoeconomic confrontation” and “geopolitical contestation of strategic resources” are top 10 risks for business leaders in both advanced economies and emerging markets. The former ranks in the top five for executives in East Asia and the Pacific Europe and Central Asia. In advanced economies “interstate conflict” ranked as a top 10 concern reflecting not only the invasion of Ukraine but also increased tensions in the Taiwan Strait.

However geopolitical concerns vary between regions. While “state collapse” featured among top risks in multiple Latin-American countries the threat of economic sanctions and trade wars worry respondents in China and Japan the most.

Shifting Environmental Risk Profile

In a year of notable extreme heat events droughts wildfires floods and windstorms that have translated — to date — into more than 29 billion-dollar weather disasters in North America Europe East and South Asia it’s no surprise that “natural disasters and extreme weather events” is a top 10 concern in emerging markets while aggregate responses from advanced economies prioritize the “failure of climate-change adaptation.”

Environmental and geopolitical challenges come together in concern about “severe commodity supply crises” owing to lower yields and crop failures. Through a different lens resources (such as lithium and cobalt) that are critical for the global clean energy transition have geographically concentrated supply chains: The top three producing countries of rare-earth minerals provide over three-quarters of global output.

Cyber Risks Overshadowed

With such an intense focus on economic and geopolitical issues cyber and digital risks featured less prominently in the rankings this year especially for executives based in advanced economies where no technological risk appeared in the aggregate top 10. This is despite notable recent cross-border cyberattacks and hopefully therefore not indicative of a blind spot in risk awareness.

However with more than one-third of the global population still lacking access to the internet responses from emerging markets continued to highlight concerns about the digital divide which the pandemic has made more glaring. “Lack of widespread access to digital services and digital inequality” was in the top five for respondents in Latin America and the Caribbean South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

Scope for International Collaboration?

The upcoming G-20 summit in Bali represents an important opportunity to find a shared agenda for resolving economic pain points. But divided responses to the invasion of Ukraine (only half of G-20 countries have joined international sanctions against Russia) marked but varying concerns about the ambitions of China and simmering resentment of U.S. diplomatic pressure suggest complex polarities that will likely make progress by leaders of this disparate group of countries even harder to achieve than normal.

Interestingly Indonesia’s presidency of the G-20 is the first in a series of major emerging market economies assuming leadership of the forum — India Brazil and South Africa are next in line — providing an opportunity for the forum to foreground the risk realities of Global South nations.

From Concurrent Crises to Different Possible Futures

Having come through the pandemic businesses must nonetheless anticipate a series of concurrent entangled crises that may herald future strategic contexts they had not considered several years ago. While many firms with an eye to a global economic downturn are tightening their belts the most strategic leaders are scoping out the scenarios that may lie beyond and examining how well their plans stack up against each.

The youngest child of David Mazer and Lois Mazer (neé Atkins) Phyllis was born in East Stroudsburg Pennsylvania on May 21 1929. She attended school in East Stroudsburg where her father ran the Three Point Gardens flower nursery inspiring in her a lifelong love of flowers and gardens. Phyllis left home for college at the age of 16 and after three years in the University of Chicago’s Great Books program she moved to New York City. She began her career at Time Inc. as a receptionist working her way up to become Director of the Picture Collection at Life Magazine before leaving to start her family in 1956.

Phyllis was married to Thomas Sternau in 1950. Although both Phyllis and Tom were studying at the University of Chicago they met at a New Year’s Eve party in New Jersey. Tom earned a law degree and practiced briefly before going into his father’s insurance business Smith-Sternau a thriving group insurance business that they subsequently sold to Marsh and McLennan. Phyllis got her first taste of international travel with Tom in the 1970s when he started a branch of the Smith-Sternau office in London. They also enjoyed several hiking adventures in Alaska. Summers and weekends were spent at their house in Easton Connecticut and while their family was young at a campsite on Sable Island Saranac Lake New York. Phyllis was a fine pianist and an excellent and adventurous cook. Both she and her husband often opened their New York home to friends who were just starting out and in need of a place to stay.

During the 1970s Phyllis worked for the New York City Parks Department writing brochures about the city’s parks that she illustrated with her own photographs. She also developed a cookie business shortly before the big cookie craze—her uniquely-flavored fortune cookies (with riddles) called Riddelettes were made by her company Gauffrettes Unlimited and briefly distributed to specialty food departments at Macy’s and Bloomingdales. In the 1980s Phyllis also assisted with Tom’s Performing Arts Book Club which specialized in books about music opera and dance.

When her children were young adults Phyllis became interested in photography and travel passions that dominated the rest of her life. She studied photography and darkroom techniques with Daniel Kazimierski at the International Center for Photography. Taking frequent trips to Alaska Europe India China the Middle East across the United States and around the world Phyllis was never without multiple cameras and travel journals; a 1980 diagnosis of type one diabetes never slowed her down.

After Tom’s death in 2007 Phyllis continued to travel often with her daughter Susan Sternau destinations included California Iceland Mexico Prague Berlin Chile and Easter Island. Phyllis also took classes in Juilliard's music education program where she found many like-minded friends. After age made travel difficult Phyllis continued to enjoy the company of friends Central Park books and The New York Times.

Phyllis is survived by her half sister Ellen Milt of Plymouth Massachusetts and her two daughters: Cynthia Sternau of New York City a musician composer and editor and Susan Sternau of Cathedral City California a landscape painter and art teacher.

Phyllis was a lifelong supporter of civil rights democracy and liberal thought.

It has been spoofed on “Saturday Night Live” and “The Simpsons.” (Homer Simpson would go on to star in his own Priceless commercial.) In Japan the word ""Priceless"" now needs no translation.

It was the meme before there were memes says Joyce King Thomas the McCann advertising executive who created the Priceless campaign for Mastercard in 1997.

Raja Rajamannar the company’s current chief marketing and communications officer joined Mastercard in 2013 but vividly recalled watching that first Priceless commercial about a boy and his father at a baseball game and telling his marketing team at the time: “Why didn’t we think of that?”

“Priceless” Rajamannar says “is something that is so expansive that is so inclusive it can go anywhere we want it to go.”

Today it spans both moments — through the company’s experiential marketing and multisensory branding efforts — and movements he says. It harnesses emerging platforms like the metaverse and drives product development including True Name a feature that lets trans and nonbinary people use their true name on their cards and the Touch Card for the visually impaired. “It literally has become the manifestation of our company’s good intent and our company’s mission.”

The Mastercard Newsroom recently spoke to Thomas who went on to become McCann’s chief creative officer and McCann’s current chief creative officer Pierre Lipton who has been working with Mastercard to evolve the platform for the next 25 years and beyond:

The best ads are ads that feel true. How did McCann come up with the idea at the heart at Priceless — that there are some things money can’t buy? Joyce take us back to that brainstorming session in 1997.

Thomas: In that year 1997 cards were not accepted many places. Even at a grocery store people would use checks — imagine using checks at a grocery store! And they were not accepted at baseball stadiums. That first spot was an announcement of Mastercard acceptance at a baseball stadium.

The other thing that was shifting was culture — the team looked at research about what was meaningful to people. After the go-go ‘80s and “greed is good” things were shifting. Being able to spend time with their families was growing as a symbol of status as while things like designer watches were dropping as status symbols. We looked at those two things: You can make everyday purchases with cards now but actually they lead to the best things in life … Eventually it became “There are something things money can’t buy. For everything else there’s Mastercard.” Obviously a financial company saying there are some things money can’t buy was disruptive. I think it made the whole thing feel genuine. There are some things money can’t buy. We recognize that. We know there are going to be other things that are more important to you.

What has been key to keeping Priceless fresh over the years?

Thomas: One of the best things about Priceless is that whatever you love whatever your interest there’s a way for you to communicate it via the Priceless campaign. We’ve had some tremendous creative people bringing different flavors and different thoughts and different ideas to Priceless but always with that strategic base. The brief would be ""Let’s talk about acceptance at a home improvement store"" and someone would bring their experience their flavor their sense of humor to the advertising. That’s what really kept it fresh and evolved. And then the campaign took some major leaps as we took Priceless from observational to actually embedding it into the world and the brand. Priceless in many ways is more important than saying ""Priceless"" – being deep and meaningful and knowing what’s important in life.

Lipton: One of the things that we had seen over and over again was what millennials deem important. And what a lot of brands would talk about is that millennials want brands to stand for something. Working with a platform like this with a brand like this that does so much we had to do something beyond saying we stood for something. We had to move from the age of awareness to the age of action.

How do digitization and emerging technologies impact the way you bring Priceless to life?

Lipton: At its core Priceless is always the same. It’s that magic that happens when you connect with someone or when you experience something larger than yourself. That magic of living. For me when we march forward into technology the barriers to having those experiences are what changes. The context is what changes. The feeling is the same. When you talk about multisensory marketing for example think about how you experience the world through a VR headset. You’re doing it through your senses but the context is different. Is there an additional barrier within that environment to having a Priceless experience? I think navigating through technology in order to get to a fundamentally human experience is what our job is.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vbmV3cy93ZWFyYWJsZXMvMjAyMi9tYXN0ZXJjYXJkLWRlYnV0cy10YXAtYW5kLWdvLXJhY2UtYmlicy1hdC1ueWMtbWFyYXRob24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mastercard Debuts Tap and Go Race Bibs at NYC Marathon,"When runners who were preparing to participate in the New York City Marathon picked up their race materials for the Sunday (Nov. 6) event one of the items was a race bib that could be equipped with a method for contactless payments.

A race bib is the paper with the participant’s unique identification number that runners wear around their necks during the event. In the case of this year’s New York City Marathon runners could also visit Mastercard at the event to have one of the company’s “Tap & Go” contactless payment chips that was preloaded with $10 adhered to their bib Mastercard told PYMNTS in an email.

“As part of its sponsorship of the TCS NYC Marathon this year Mastercard is elevating its tech impact through unique offerings like contactless bibs” Mastercard said in the email. “This new technology along with Priceless experiences for cardholders runners and spectators serves to display how Mastercard is at the forefront of what the future of the race can be.”

This year’s NYC Marathon drew more than 50000 registered participants according to the event’s website.

The marathon returned to its full capacity for the first time since 2019 and included nearly 48000 finishers according to a press release.

Mastercard reported in January that contactless payments are increasingly becoming the preferred way to pay.

In fact contactless payments now account for one in every two in-person switched transactions globally up from a one-in-three ratio previously the company reported at the time.

“We’re making great progress and expanding contactless acceptance by turning the world’s billions of active smartphones into potential acceptance devices enabling people to buy and sell whenever wherever they want” Mastercard CEO Michael Miebach said Jan. 27 during the company’s quarterly earnings call.

Miebach also said Mastercard is “leaning into payment innovation in areas like installments contactless acceptance and cryptocurrencies.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vaWJzaW50ZWxsaWdlbmNlLmNvbS9pYnNpLW5ld3MvYXN0cm9wYXktbGF1bmNoZXMtaXRzLW5ldy1wcm9kdWN0LW1hc3RlcmNhcmQtcHJlcGFpZC1jYXJkLWluLWJyYXppbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AstroPay launches its new product Mastercard Prepaid Card in Brazil,"AstroPay launches its new product Mastercard Prepaid Card in Brazil

For Europe to prosper small businesses need to thrive. The lead message of the European Commission’s “Relief Package for SMEs” epitomises the importance of small businesses to the health of the region’s economy. This is no surprise considering they form 99.8% of all businesses in the EU – which translates to 25 million enterprises and almost 100 million employees.

At Mastercard we recognise the challenges the region’s small businesses have faced – and will continue to face – as a result of the pandemic geopolitical turbulence and economic uncertainty. We have worked alongside the small business sector in Europe for over half a century and commit to playing a leading role in supporting their short and long-term survival recovery and growth.

This month we are pleased to mark two key moments for our small business support efforts across Europe: the one-year anniversary of Strive UK and the launch of its sister initiative Strive Czech Republic.

The evolution of Strive

Strive is an initiative tailored for the modern challenges faced by small business entrepreneurs. Launched by the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth – our inspiring philanthropic hub – Strive aims to strengthen the financial resilience of small businesses by providing them with the resources and network to recover and unlock growth.

Last autumn we launched Strive UK with a mission: to empower 650000 British small businesses to thrive in the digital economy over the next three years and beyond. This came with a focused commitment to support female business owners and those from minority ethnic backgrounds.

In the 12 months that have followed together with our partners we have supported half a million small businesses – stemming from green go-karting to Caribbean cuisine – in their digital journeys and have run a series of mentoring programmes. It’s been an exciting year and I look forward to seeing what comes next.

To build on the initiative’s success in the UK we are now launching Strive Czechia to expand our commitment to Europe’s small business economy and support an engine that generates almost half of the Czech Republic’s combined revenue and employs half of its people.

The goal of the programme is to partner with the Czech Ministry of Industry and Trade Czechitas the Czech Chamber of Commerce and the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Crafts CZ among others to bolster the digital and financial resilience of 250000 Czech small businesses and enable their business growth over the course of a three-year programme and beyond.[i]

Providing the technology for small businesses to recover and grow

It is no secret that the events of recent years have incited an urgent need for small businesses to digitise. Almost half of firms in the EU invested further in digitalisation as a result of covid-19. On average those that did so were more productive innovative grew faster and paid higher wages than their slower counterparts.

Our network and technology combine to make the European digital single market a reality and so we acknowledge the facilitating role we can play in small businesses’ digital journey. This year we have worked across the region to foster partnerships and deploy technology that enables entrepreneurs to optimise recovery and growth efforts.

Two personal highlights have been the work we’ve done with PostePay in Italy and Czakó Farmers’ Market in Hungary both aimed at making the lives of small business owners more convenient and more profitable.

Staying safe is also a monumental challenge for small businesses embarking on a digital journey. An estimated 28% of European small businesses experienced at least one type of cybercrime last year. By leveraging our technology and fostering cybersecurity education programmes – such as that we created with Les Digiteurs in France – we aim to give peace of mind to Europe’s small businesses and enable them to focus their energy on driving recovery and growth.

Fuelling the flame of Europe’s start-up innovation

To conclude I want to remind you that – despite the challenging environment in which they’re operating – Europe’s small businesses form a bubbling hotspot of innovation.

At Mastercard we aim to support the regional push to become a global technology leader. We celebrate collaborate with and support the cultivation of those pioneering this culture across the region especially when it comes to fintechs that have such an intrinsic link to our own business.

This year alone we have celebrated Nordic and Baltic’s most exciting fintechs through our MASSIV and FINITIV programmes and welcomed London-based embedded finance network mmob to our Start Path accelerator. We’ve also launched Start Path Ukraine to enable Ukrainian start-ups to accelerate growth and contribute to the rebuilding of the country’s economy.

The journey of a small business will always encounter risk challenges and opportunity. At Mastercard we will always strive to stand alongside Europe’s entrepreneurs and enable them to take a path of recovery growth and prosperity.

The first legs are scheduled for 14/15/21/22 February with the second legs on 7/8/14/15 March. Kick-offs are at 21:00 CET.

How did the Champions League round of 16 draw work?

The draw respected the following principles in accordance with Paragraphs 13.07 and 18.01 of the 2022/23 UEFA Champions League Regulations:

- The group winners were seeded above the runners-up.

- Clubs from the same association could not be drawn against each other.

- Group winners were drawn against runners-up from a different group.

- The runners-up play the first leg at home.

- The group winners were seeded above the runners-up. - Clubs from the same association could not be drawn against each other. - Group winners were drawn against runners-up from a different group. - The runners-up play the first leg at home. Eight balls containing the names of the group runners-up were placed in a bowl.

A first ball was drawn from the bowl. The team drawn was placed as the home team in match 1.

In accordance with the above draw conditions the computer then showed which group winners were eligible to play as the visiting team in match 1. These teams' names were placed in a bowl.

A ball was drawn from that bowl to complete the pairing for match 1. The team drawn was placed as the visiting team in match 1.

The above procedure was repeated for the remaining matches.

If the computer indicated that only one group winner was eligible to play as the visiting team in a match that team was automatically assigned to the match and no ball was drawn.

Pakistan 128 for 5 (Rizwan 32 Haris 31) beat Bangladesh 127 for 8 (Shanto 54 Afridi 4-22 Shadab 2-30) by five wickets



A team under pressure. A captain refusing to give up. The odds piling up against them. And then one fine day the stars align.

Pakistan cranked up the deja vu in Adelaide on Sunday as they sailed into the T20 World Cup semi-finals. If anyone is still working on time travel please follow this cricket team. They've made it 1992 again

This game wouldn't even have played out this way if not for Netherlands shocking South Africa . Some people might call that destiny.

At the receiving end of this unreal series of events were Bangladesh and Shakib Al Hasan . His wicket turned this game adjudged lbw on field and upheld on DRS even though he was absolutely certain he'd nicked the ball

Bangladesh were 70 for 1 after 10 overs. Then they lost their captain and could manage only 127 for 8. Advantage Pakistan.

Wasim Akram lite

Shaheen Shah Afridi admitted he's not 100% at this tournament. Someone should splice that press conference video with the ball he bowled to Mosaddek Hossain. Left-arm. High pace. Around the wicket. Reverse swing. Bowled 'iiiiimmmmmmm!

Growing up he would have shoved Wasim Akram videos straight into his veins. Now he's recreated his idol's most famous dismissal on the grandest stage with everything on the line. How many people get to do that? How many people are good enough to do that?

The good the bad and the collapse

Najmul Hossain Shanto (54 off 48) was smiling. His leading edge had pretty much bunny-hopped for four over point. That was the first over. Back when Bangladesh had gained a sizeable advantage batting first on a used pitch where shot-making got harder as time went on.

Even halfway through they were sitting pretty. Then it happened.

Shadab Khan looped one up over the batter's eyeline. Shakib accepted the invitation and came charging out of his crease. The legspinner's dip deceived him. A big hit turned into a scramble to put bat on ball.

Shakib thought he did. Umpire Adrian Holdstock on field didn't. DRS came into play and everything turned murky. UltraEdge showed a spike but the third umpire Langton Rusere thought that was bat hitting ground. Only there seemed a fraction of daylight between those two things.

The on-field decision was upheld. And Shakib was distraught. He kept standing there swinging his arms around wondering what was going on. The Bangladesh captain had to literally be pushed out of the field.

That wicket was part of a procession: 6 for 36.

Mohammad Haris played a crucial innings of 31 off 18 balls • Associated Press

Another expensive no-ball

The Adelaide pitch wasn't great for strokeplay. Batters kept trying to hit out but it just wasn't happening. On the broadcast a telling stat came up: the strike rate when pace was on was 122 but it was only 28 when pace was off.

That kept Bangladesh in it. That's the reason this game was even alive. Remember earlier in the day on this very surface South Africa came undone against Netherlands' slower balls to turn this into a quarter-final.

Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan put on their first fifty partnership of this T20 World Cup. But Bangladesh fought back.

They were an angry team. A team raging against the way the world was working. At one point when an lbw didn't go Bangladesh's way Shakib grabbed his cap and flung it into the turf. They could easily have been distracted by these things but they kept at it.

They pushed this game into the death - and then unravelled.

Taskin Ahmed who could have had a wicket in his first over if not for a bad fumble from the wicketkeeper Nurul Hasan who has carried his team on his back in these Super 12s overstepped.

The equation was 30 off 28. They had taken a wicket five balls ago. The pressure was piling on Pakistan.

Then - much like in that game against India - a team that desperately needed a free-hit got one. And 21-year old Mohammad Haris whacked it for six.

Pakistan are into the knockouts now. They even returned the favour to Netherlands giving them a great chance of finishing fourth in Group 2 which ensures they will play the next T20 World Cup.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYWZvbmxpbmUuY29tL2NhZi13b21lbnMtY2hhbXBpb25zLWxlYWd1ZS9uZXdzL21hdGNoLWRheS0zLWdyb3VwLWEtcG9zdC1tYXRjaC1mYWN0cy1ncmVlbi1idWZmYWxvZXMtMC0yLXNpbWJhLXF1ZWVucy1zYy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,match-day-3-group-a-post-match-facts-green-buffaloes-0-2-simba-queens-sc,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyaWNidXp6LmNvbS9jcmlja2V0LW5ld3MvMTI0NDUzL3J5YW4tdGVuLWRvZXNjaGF0ZS10by1qb2luLWtrci1hcy1maWVsZGluZy1jb2FjaNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ryan ten Doeschate to join KKR as fielding coach,"IPL 2023

Ryan ten Doeschate to join KKR as fielding coach

Ryan ten Doeschate the South Africa born former Netherlands international is set to join the support staff of the Kolkata Knight Riders side in the Indian Premier League (IPL). He will be the team's new fielding coach and replace James Foster who has been promoted as an assistant coach. Both will of course be reporting to head coach Chandrakant Pandit.

Ten Doeschate (42) a former KKR player who was part of the title winning squads of 2012 and 2014 could also be involved in a role in the franchise's subsidiary in the UAE League (ILT20). He will be an assistant coach for the Abu Dhabi Knight Riders side.

KKR team sources have confirmed the development to Cribuzz stating that TenDo as the former Netherlands captain is known has 'always been a Knight Rider'. Ten Doeschate announced his retirement from international cricket last year and has also completed his stint with the Essex side in English County Cricket.

Elsewhere in ILT20 Phil Simmons is likely to join as the head coach of Dubai Capitals. The franchise owned by Kiran Kumar Granthi a co-owner of Delhi Capitals is in talks with the outgoing West Indies coach who recently stepped down after the side's poor showing at ongoing T20 World Cup in Australia.

Simmons is currently in Australia where he will guide the West Indies team in the two-Test series against the hosts starting November 30.

Auction likely in India now

Meanwhile it is learnt that the IPL and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) seem to have shelved the plans of having the December 16 mini-auction in Istanbul.

The Istanbul idea was initially floated among the franchises but had to be dropped because of logistical and operational problems. The new venue has not yet been finalised but it will be in India itself.

MKC,McCormick & Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL3RydW1wLWJhY2tlZC1zZW5hdGUtaG9wZWZ1bC1kYXZlLW1jY29ybWljay1oYXMtZXh0ZW5zaXZlLWRlZXAtc3RhdGUtdGllc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trump-Backed Senate Hopeful Dave McCormick Has Extensive 'Deep State' Ties,"As he runs for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania Dave McCormick’s claims to his “home state” have been a source of contention on the campaign trail: the Republican hedge fund titan spent much of his youth in Pennsylvania but has lived out most of his recent adult and professional days in Connecticut.

While the extent of McCormick’s ties to his “home state” are cloudy his ties to another state—the “deep state”—seem far more clear.

Despite his claims to the MAGA movement McCormick is steeped in the nexus of government intelligence and big business that Donald Trump and his acolytes ambiguously refer to as “the deep state.”

Those connections range from colleagues to boards to corporate investments with additional ties to notorious surveillance systems and an internal monitoring project at McCormick’s firm—the legendary hedge fund Bridgewater Associates—that was directly modeled after the Chinese Communist Party’s autocratic surveillance state.

And in the mind of Trump who is McCormick’s most crucial political ally some of those ties would be about as problematic as a MAGA Republican can get—such as for instance former FBI Director James Comey.

Comey it turns out accepted a senior role at Bridgewater the year after McCormick signed on as the fund’s president. As general counsel Comey oversaw an internal security program whose invasive and sometimes demeaning methods of surveillance and interrogation earned him a reputation as Bridgewater’s “in-house inquisitor.”

Aside from Comey the most prominent of McCormick’s “deep state” affiliations is his recent three-year run as a paid trustee of the secretive government-backed investment group In-Q-Tel—quite literally the Central Intelligence Agency’s very own venture capital firm.

McCormick’s role at In-Q-Tel appears on his candidate financial disclosures where he listed the entity’s name as “IQT.” Tax filings from In-Q-Tel which is registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit show that McCormick joined as a trustee in March 2018 and left in 2022 as he pursued his first Senate campaign. He collected an annual $35000 salary logging five hours of work a week according to the tax records and his election bid has since seen hundreds of thousands of dollars in support from executives tied to IQT and its investments.

For McCormick his deep state connections embody the larger political contradictions he’s already been forced to reconcile as a corporate Republican seeking office in the quasi-populist era of Trump.

That tortured balancing act failed two years ago. In the 2022 GOP primary in Pennsylvania the lifelong moderate failed to land Trump’s endorsement—losing that honor and subsequently the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz.

While McCormick got the coveted Trump endorsement this year—though there weren’t any other viable Republicans running in the primary—the dissonance is starker than ever.

Today the MAGA wing of the Republican Party finds itself fully enthralled with conspiracy theories about the intelligence community which Trump and his allies have for years cast as public enemy No. 1. Trump is vowing retribution as a key 2024 campaign plank.

Given that McCormick’s challenge to Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) will be one of the most contentious races of the 2024 cycle the hedge funder turned true MAGA believer may have to work harder than expected to scrub his deep establishment ties in order to appeal to his new base.

A former colleague of McCormick’s at Bridgewater told The Daily Beast that McCormick was “an honorable man” a “stand-up guy” and an “independent” and “brilliant leader.” But the colleague also put his finger on the Trump issue calling it a “sad reality” that McCormick will have to cave to the whims of the former president.

“He knows that if he wins he won’t get to do what he thinks is right” the person said. “He has his own money and he won’t be so susceptible to outside pressures financially. But he’s still going to have to kiss the ring and that’s unfortunate.”

McCormick’s campaign did not respond to detailed questions for this article.

It’s not clear if Trump knew about McCormick’s work with the U.S. intelligence community including the CIA and Comey. But as it turns out the deep state overlaps in myriad ways with McCormick’s 13-year tenure as a top executive at Bridgewater.

In 2010—the year after McCormick left George W. Bush’s Treasury Department to sign on as Bridgewater’s president—Bridgewater hired Comey who would later come to embody the darkest of Trump’s paranoiac accusations about federal agents.

Bridgewater brought Comey on officially as head of security and general counsel. In practice however Comey’s role more closely resembled that of an “in-house inquisitor” over the first iteration of the firm’s oppressive internal employee monitoring program which would later come to be called “The Politburo.”

Before he led the FBI unleashed a bombshell on Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign and got fired by Trump Comey reportedly raked in $7 million per year at Bridgewater. His task was to keep employees in line with the goals of what firm founder Ray Dalio called “radical transparency.” Those efforts included constant surveillance—including recorded meetings and videotaped internal “trials” of employees—with Dalio telling Bridgewater staff that Comey was “like a godfather adjudicating it all.”

The taped meetings were “just the tip of the surveillance ecosystem” at Bridgewater Vanity Fair reported in its profile of Comey’s time with the firm.

“A slew of ex FBI agents staffed the security team. Not only did cameras cover seemingly every inch of the property but they seemed to be watched in real time. Staffers who left their desks even briefly would return to sticky notes left on their computer monitors admonishing them for failing to put up a screen saver” Vanity Fair reported.

Comey would go through employee cellphone and computer records and was apparently so intrusive that he embarrassed one executive into resigning.

But when Comey’s security posse only turned up “little evidence of actual offending behavior to snuff out they created their own” according to Vanity Fair.

In one instance the report said Comey left an executive’s binder clearly labeled and unattended in Bridgewater offices. He then watched as surveillance cameras captured a low-ranking employee discovering the binder and going through it. Comey put the employee on trial and fired him with the approval of Dalio.

Comey however eventually found himself repelled by Dalio’s extremes resigning after two years. (This month Comey happens to be publishing a murder mystery novel that takes place inside a fictionalized version of Bridgewater.)

Dalio however only ramped things up implementing more and more intrusive policies to fully enact his “radical transparency” dogma.

That program it turns out was literally modeled on the Chinese Communist Party’s social surveillance program which Dalio openly admired. He even named the project after the CCP’s own “Politburo” and compared it favorably to “Big Brother” in a 60 Minutes interview.

China of course is another area where McCormick is against the prevailing GOP winds as Bridgewater’s internal culture “reflects aspects of Chinese political ideology” and invested heavily in the region—after McCormick took over as co-CEO in 2017 the fund’s Chinese investments skyrocketed.

The “Politburo” staffed up with officials from the National Security Agency and the CIA. But Bridgewater workers found it “intimidating” and “humiliating” and so intrusive that in 2017 one whistleblower filed a human rights complaint with the state of Connecticut where the fund is headquartered which was covered at the time in The New York Times.

As detailed in a recent book about Dalio titled The Fund the Politburo essentially pitted its employees against each other assigning roles like “auditors” and “overseers” and recording practically every moment of activity—all in pursuit of Dalio’s core “radical transparency” philosophy.

While the system repelled many employees—including Comey and one-time CEO Jon Rubinstein who both left after disagreements with Dalio—McCormick stayed aboard got a promotion and publicly defended Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Rubinstein quit after a “firing squad” meeting that McCormick personally sat in on according to the book where Rubinstein made the case that Dalio’s increasingly authoritarian policies were creating a “climate of fear.” When McCormick one of a handful of senior executives in the room was personally asked if he agreed with Rubinstein’s take he said he did not according to the book.

McCormick has subsequently defended Dalio. In 2020 when McCormick was asked if he took issue with a fundamental contradiction at the core of the monitoring program—“radical transparency” within the company but kept secret from outside scrutiny—he replied that he “doesn’t think it’s inconsistent at all.”

“Ray has always said this: Radical transparency is not total transparency. There are certain things that we’re not transparent about and consciously so. Personnel and salary discussions for example” McCormick said.

Shortly after rising to co-CEO McCormick joined the board at IQT.

The venture capital nonprofit which former CIA Director George Tenet founded in 1999 has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds to hundreds of technology firms and startups some of which are still secret.

Today IQT oversees more than $1 billion in assets and even has its own special-purpose acquisition company. Though the group keeps a low profile IQT maintains a close relationship with government intelligence and security divisions and runs “almost all investment decisions” by the CIA.

Many IQT investments seek to cultivate the private development of surveillance technology that could one day benefit the intelligence community and some of them overlap with both Bridgewater and McCormick.

One of those companies is Palantir a tech firm closely tied to right-wing financier Peter Thiel whose sprawling government work has made it a lightning rod for civil rights controversy—and whose fate was “rescued” by IQT’s investment.

Bridgewater itself helped fund Palantir and incorporated Palantir technology to advance its own investments as well as to help monitor Bridgewater employees in the fund’s pursuit of Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Palantir executives have contributed thousands of dollars to McCormick’s 2024 campaign.

Additionally one of IQT’s current trustees Howard Fox who also served on the board with McCormick has put serious money—more than $150000—behind McCormick’s candidacy in both 2022 and this cycle.

The same is true of other McCormick supporters like the CEO of Tenable an IQT-backed tech firm which announced its public stock offering shortly after McCormick joined the board.

And while it’s true that McCormick brings his own money to the table that hasn’t stopped Bridgewater donors from chipping in. In all Bridgewater employees mostly executives have contributed about $100000 to McCormick’s political aspirations with current president Kyle Delaney throwing $50000 to a 2022 super PAC backing his old colleague.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scoop: McCormick PAC launches big ad buy in Pennsylvania Senate race,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.axios.com/2024/05/08/mccormick-pac-ad-pennsylvania-senate-casey on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcmdhbmZoLm5ldC9vYml0dWFyeS9qb3NoLW1jY29ybWlja9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary | Josh McCormick of Huntington West Virginia,"LEWISBURG WV - Joshua Howard McCormick 38 of Huntington WV formerly of Lewisburg WV passed away May 3 2024 at home.

So I was the ideal audience for McDonald’s recently announced Cactus Plant Flea Market Boxes. They’re pricey adult or rather “adult” variations on the Happy Meal with larger food portions and a weird hipster collectible of a McDonaldland spokes-creature with four eyes instead of a piece of plastic advertising the latest Disney cartoon or Marvel movie.

When I learned of the existence of these throwback exercises in pandering nostalgia I rolled my eyes scoffed loudly and conceded that I’d definitely be wasting my money on these newly available consumer items all the same.

Or at least I WOULD have wasted my money on Cactus Plant Flea Market Boxes if they hadn’t run out very quickly. It was a replay of the notorious 2017 Rick and Morty “Szechuan sauce” debacle when a subplot on an episode of the cult show famously beloved by assholes led an army of nerds to angrily demand that McDonald’s bring back a dipping sauce briefly used in a Mulan promotion in 1996.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjZ2FtZXIuY29tL21jZG9uYWxkcy1nYW1pbmctY2hhaXItbWNjcmlzcHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's brings us the McCrispy gaming chair to mark the downfall of man,"I thought today would be a normal boring Monday in the office. I reply to some emails write a news post and check Twitter to see if anything's popping off only to discover that the de-evolution of man has now officially begun. Our descent into apehood starts now with the new McDonald's gaming chair—AKA: The McCrispy.

Sometimes I wonder if I’m subscribed to the right press lists. And then McDonald’s makes a gaming chair. pic.twitter.com/pzmQiy16cdNovember 7 2022

No you've not slipped into an alternate universe where Ronald McDonald is a famous esports athlete. The McCrispy is a real palpable gaming chair that you can win by entering an official McDonald's Facebook competition—because of course it's a Facebook competition.

There are only four in the entire world which means we shouldn't be seeing every Streamer with questionable revenue streams sporting one of these babies though this may yet open up a terrifying opportunity for corporations to follow suit.

I dread to think.

The design is a vomit-inducing black and yellow with McCrispy printed slantily across the leather and even a matching lumbar support pillow. Of course there's a giant M on the black headrest and even the wheels have the McDonald's yellow slapped on them.

It comes complete with a fries holder two dip holders and ""burger 'heat zone' to keep your McCrispy warm.""

Never in my 30 years on this earth have I felt the need to keep my McCrispy warm. Imagine all those germs fermenting your burger for hours on end. Moreover never have I (nor anyone I know) expressed a wish for a heat-emanating gaming chair. Gaming chairs are already warm enough with us sitting in them working up a juicy gaming sweat. Normally gaming chairs are advertising the opposite feature.

The worst part is that McDonald's is selling the seat on its grease resistant leather treatment ""so no need to worry about spills and stains."" Ah yeah just gobble it down folks. No need for table manners and you can forget about all that work you put in cleaning your gaming keyboard.

When you think about ""fast food"" there's probably a good chance that McDonald's is one of the first chains that come to mind — and understandably so. There are over 38000 McDonald's franchises spanning over 100 countries and the company has gone through more than a few eras along the way. Longtime Mickey D's fry fans will remember when McDonald's soft-launched waffle fries in 2016 then gave curly fries a try in 2017. While neither venture stuck the classic McDonald's fry is still holding down the fort all around the world.

The McRib might be on its ""Farewell Tour"" but folks have been enjoying McDonald's fries for decades. In 1948 the first McDonald's was opened when failed cinematographers Dick and Mac McDonald moved from New England to San Bernardino California to open a restaurant instead. Turns out the enterprise worked for them. According to HowStuffWorks McDonald's fries are one of the original menu items they've been serving since 1949 and today they are the single most popular item on their menu. (Step aside Big Mac.) A whopping 9 million pounds of the tasty fries are served up each day. However while McDonald's current fry-making process is the big factory operation you might expect it used to look a lot different when the first store opened its doors. Here's the unexpected method McDonald's originally used to make its iconic fries.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzExLzA3L2J1cmdlci1zYWxhZC1oYWNrLWZyb20tbWNkb25hbGRzLWRpdmlkZXMtZGluZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Burger salad' hack from McDonald's divides diners,"The meal made famous by dietitian Dr. Robert Atkins — the burger without a bun — is trending again on TikTok but for all the wrong reasons.

TikTok user Amber Rae uploaded a clip that sent salad lovers into a spin and bread lovers into bewilderment when she turned a cheeseburger into a “burger salad.”

“It’s a burger salad and it’s so good don’t judge me” she wrote over the footage with more than 143300 views.

In the 15-second video she showed off her burger salad consisting of a half pound of ground beef patty and cheese with extra lettuce and tomato and no onion or bun all packed into a plastic takeaway box.

A self-satisfied Rae wrote “When the girl at McDonald’s said she made it with love.”

Many users were envious of her leafy meal asking specifically how she managed to snag the order as McDonald’s supposedly stopped selling salads in 2021. Rae had asked for “a quarter pounder deluxe no bun add extra lettuce and it became a salad” she claimed adding that with a large latte her total came to about $11.

She shared her order to TikTok which had people begging for the recipe. @amber_rae55/Tiktok

Some were thrilled with the hack while those likely too young to remember the Atkins diet lamented the concept.

“This made me physically sick” one viewer wrote. Another disturbed witness pondered the “amount of mayo” on the salad.

In the comments Rae confirmed she used to work at McDonald’s which is how she may have known of the handy trick.

“The possibilities are unfortunately endless” she joked in a comment.

The Post have reached out to McDonald’s for comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyZWF0aXZlYmxvcS5jb20vbmV3cy9taW5pbWFsLW1jZG9uYWxkcy1hZHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These ingenious minimal McDonald's billboards are driving Reddit wild,"We've seen no shortage of creative billboard campaigns from McDonald's in recent years and they often serve to demonstrate how powerful brand recognition can be. With just a few words or even colours an ad can clearly belong to one particular brand – and this might just be the most minimal offering we've seen.

These minimal billboards are a few years old but they've recently resurfaced on Reddit – and users are loving the designs. The campaign asks viewers to 'follow the arches' with cropped details of the famous McDonald's golden arches acting as direction signs pointing towards the nearest restaurant. (Looking for more inspiration? Check out the best print ads ever.)

Design agency Cossette describes how the campaign chops up ""the world's most recognisable logo"" to prove that ""the McDonald’s arches are so ingrained in the minds of consumers that even if you cut them into pieces they’re still familiar."" By zooming in on aspects of the symbol the agency created ""universally understandable road signs"".

(Image credit: Cossette)

And Reddit users are marvelling at just how recognisable they are. ""McDonald's are the kings of brand recognition. At that point I'm pretty sure a full red billboard would still remind us of them"" one user comments while another adds ""They literally own the colour combination of red and yellow.""

Some of the many multi-lingual versions of the concept (Image credit: Cossette)

Indeed this isn't the first ingenious minimal piece of marketing we've seen from McDonald's – remember when it ditched its branding entirely? Still last year's sizzling Burger King rebrand still wears the crown when it comes to burger branding.

Injuries from the resulting car accident were minor compared to the devastating news discovered in his MRI: his seizure was caused by a grade IV glioblastoma an aggressive brain cancer tumor.

As sales district manager for the Medtronic Cranial and Spinal Technologies business which develops technologies and tools used to help surgeons remove cancerous brain tumors Hugo knew right away his prognosis wasn’t good. Even with treatment the average life expectancy for glioblastoma patients is 12-15 months. And only a tiny percentage of patients survive more than five years.

“Being in this industry that was like getting hit with a truck” said Hugo a married father of two young children. “I love my kids. I love my wife and it was tough but at the same time whether it’s six months a year or five years my perspective is I get up every single day and I’m thankful to be here.”

Hugo is also thankful that five years ago he convinced his wife Vanessa to leave her career in litigation so she could pursue her passion for research and writing by joining Medtronic as a clinical researcher. After the initial shock and some time to process her husband’s diagnosis Vanessa sprang into action — putting the research skills she’d learned in her role for Medtronic to work on behalf of her husband.

“I started with the clinical literature reading everything I could” said Vanessa who became her husband’s fiercest healthcare advocate. “I tried to understand out of all the clinical trials out there which ones were the most promising what their strategies were and which ones were recruiting. We were going to leave no stone unturned. If there was any aspect of his health of history that we could control and we could improve his chances we were going to do it.”

Tough Decisions

Neurosurgeons like Dr. Michael Ivan from the University of Miami are one of the first healthcare professionals to help guide patients through a decision tree of choices on how to tackle the tumors.

The aggressive nature of glioblastoma tumors usually requires surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible but this kind of surgery comes with risks. Certain parts of the brain can control different functions like speech vision processing and movement. Damage to the brain to any of these areas could mean loss of some function for the remainder of the patient’s life. Neurosurgeons rely heavily on advanced imaging to know exactly where the tumor is what its boundaries are and what critical brain networks are nearby.

That’s where surgical navigation systems like the Medtronic StealthStation™ S8 play a critical role. Not only can these systems help doctors plan their surgical approach through advanced visualization and automatic 3-D segmentation tools but it also helps track the location of the surgical instruments in real time during the procedure.

“For Michael’s care and for patients like Michael getting the best imaging to know exactly where the tumor is its functional boundaries what critical networks are close to this and what is the risk of the surgery — that is the first step in deciding the best approach” said Dr Ivan part of Michael’s care team. “We have a lot of tools at our fingertips to get in there touch the brain the least amount as possible and to get out — whether that be laser surgery minimally invasive port surgery awake surgery or surgery just based on the functional imaging.”

Since the invasive tumor grows into brain tissue complete removal isn’t possible and surgery is usually followed by radiation and chemotherapy aimed at killing the remaining tumor cells. Despite these extreme efforts the prognosis remains grim for most patients. In almost every case the tumors still come back.

Mike Hugo felt confident knowing the same cutting-edge technology he’d spent years promoting in his job for Medtronic would be used to help remove his tumor. Though his resection surgery went “spectacularly” and left him with very few function deficits the tumor started growing back right away.

The Path Forward

Hugo is ready to continue the fight for his life. Fortunately he’s known for facing tough challenges with an amazing attitude. By the time he’d met his wife he’d already completed his first Ironman triathlon widely considered the most difficult one-day sporting event in the world. And when most people would proudly stop after their first Mike immediately began training for another. And another. He’s crossed the Ironman finish line eleven times in total.

Mike after finishing an Ironman in 2018.

“He’s the strongest person I know” said Vanessa who started #IronHugo to raise awareness around her husband’s cancer. “You can take a diagnosis like this and let it beat you up feel sorry for yourself and let it knock you down or you can get back up. We’re choosing to see the good and keep fighting every single day.”

Mike’s story served as an inspiration when Medtronic hosted its first ever Cranial Consortium an event aimed at bringing together more than 60 leaders in cranial neurosurgery from 14 different countries to experience Medtronic’s cutting-edge technology and collaborate with their peers and industry leaders to transform the future of technology in neurosurgery. “As we continue to engineer the extraordinary it’s important we remember that people like Mike Hugo are why we do what we do” said Linnea Burman Vice President and General Manager of Enabling Technologies at Medtronic

“We have two daughters and people tell us all the time about how strong brave and adventurous our daughters are and they 100 percent get that from Michael. He’s already passed that on in their young years and we’re hoping he has many many more years building them up and helping them grow into the amazing people that they were meant to be.”

While Vanessa continues to raise funds for cancer research she’s is still actively advocating for her husband to participate in various clinical trials as they search for hope. Their colleagues at Medtronic say they’re working toward a future where artificial intelligence within Medtronic surgical ecosystems may one day be able automatically match patients like Mike with emerging clinical trials that may be best suited for their specific diagnosis. Meanwhile Mike is committed to doing everything he can to beat the cancer and says every word of support matters.

“It’s a game of inches — a game of percentages” says Mike Hugo “It all adds up and we’re hoping that it makes a difference.”

The data were presented today as Late-Breaking Clinical Science at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions 2022. With this news Medtronic has submitted the final module of the Symplicity Spyral™ Premarket Approval (PMA) package to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for review and approval.

Subjects who were prescribed antihypertensive medications and were treated with the Medtronic Symplicity Spyral Renal Denervation (RDN) System had a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in office-based systolic blood pressure (OSBP) a key secondary endpoint compared to subjects in the sham control group. However in the primary endpoint RDN did not demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure (ABPM) due to increased medications in the sham control group and the potential impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on the clinical trial environment. The study also included Win Ratio a pre-specified secondary endpoint that combines reduction in blood pressure with reduction in medication burden which enables assessment of the overall beneficial effect of RDN. The Win Ratio demonstrated significance in favor of RDN versus a sham procedure. Finally the study met its primary safety endpoint with a low incidence of procedure-related and clinical adverse events.

""The ON MED study demonstrated significant reductions in office-based blood pressure the most commonly used measure in clinical practice. Additionally we saw reductions in absolute blood pressure that were consistent with earlier RDN studies"" said David Kandzari M.D. chief Piedmont Heart Institute and Cardiovascular Services and SPYRAL HTN-ON MED lead principal investigator. ""Surprisingly 24-hour ABPM declined with RDN but did not differ from the sham group and the primary endpoint was not met. More than 80% of patients in the ON MED expansion group experienced follow up during the Covid-19 pandemic. Compared with patients enrolled before the pandemic significant differences in baseline 24-hour ABPM were observed that may reflect changes in patient behavior and lifestyle during the pandemic.123 Additionally patients treated with the sham procedure increased the amount of medication they were taking compared to those treated with RDN. These factors likely contributed to the smaller than expected differences in ABPM.""

SPYRAL HTN-ON MED is a global randomized sham-controlled trial investigating the blood pressure lowering effect and safety of RDN with the radiofrequency (RF)-based Symplicity Spyral RDN system in hypertensive patients who have been prescribed up to three anti-hypertensive medications including diuretics calcium channel blockers ACE/ARB inhibitors or beta blockers. A total of 337 patients with uncontrolled hypertension were enrolled at 42 sites across the United States Europe Japan Australia and Canada and were randomized 2:1 to RDN (n=205) versus sham control (n=132). Results were as follows:

The primary Bayesian efficacy endpoint of 24-hr systolic ABPM reduction was not met with a 51% probability of superiority for the RDN group versus those who received a sham control procedure. However nighttime systolic ABPM reduction was statistically significant.

6.5 mmHg 24-hr systolic ABPM reduction in the RDN group versus 4.5 mmHg in the control group (treatment difference of -1.9 mmHg p=0.119)



6.7 mmHg nighttime systolic ABPM reduction in the RDN group versus 3.0 mmHg in the control group (treatment difference of -3.7 mmHg p=0.01)

The study met the prespecified secondary endpoint which was the change in OSBP from baseline to six-month follow-up between the RDN group (n=199) and the sham control group (n=126).

Statistically significant 9.9 mmHg OSBP reductions in the RDN group versus a 4.9 mmHg reduction in the sham control group (treatment difference of -4.9 mmHg p=0.001)

The study met the primary safety endpoint evaluating major adverse events at one-month post-procedure and renal artery stenosis at six-months pooled across the SPYRAL HTN-ON and OFF MED studies (p<0.001)

RDN demonstrated a low incidence of procedure-related and clinical adverse events at six-months in the SPYRAL HTN-ON MED study specifically.

The Win Ratio demonstrated significance in favor of RDN versus a sham procedure (p=0.005).

Overall burden of medications was higher in the sham control group at six-months (p=0.04).

""Renal denervation lowers blood pressure and requires less medication for patients with hypertension"" said Laura Mauri M.D. chief scientific medical and regulatory officer at Medtronic. ""It is also a safe procedure. In this study specifically RDN met both the safety endpoint for this trial as well as the overall safety endpoint across the SPYRAL HTN ON and OFF MED studies.""

The SPYRAL HTN-ON MED Trial4 is a part of the Medtronic SPYRAL HTN Global Clinical Program – the most comprehensive clinical program studying RDN - including the SPYRAL HTN-OFF MED Pivotal Trial5 and the currently-enrolling SPYRAL AFFIRM Study. Along with the real-world data from the Global SYMPLICITY Registry (GSR)6 the Medtronic RDN program is backed by experience in more than 20000 patients treated globally studied in the presence and absence of medication and in patients with high baseline cardiovascular risk.

""In addition to the consistent absolute blood pressure drops that we have demonstrated across trials long-term data from key Medtronic studies— which were highlighted in two important publications this year in The Lancet78— have also demonstrated the durability and 'always on' effect of RDN"" said Jason Weidman senior vice president and president of the Coronary and Renal Denervation business which is part of the Cardiovascular Portfolio at Medtronic. ""The ON MED results presented today serve as an additional piece of our extensive compendium of safety and efficacy evidence on this procedure. With these results in hand we submitted our PMA package to the FDA which includes the totality of available evidence from the SPYRAL HTN clinical program. We are excited about the potential to bring this important procedure to millions of U.S. patients in need.""

Approved for commercial use in more than 60 countries around the world the Symplicity Spyral RDN system is limited to investigational use in the United States Japan and Canada.

He now has the right to appeal against the ruling.

The Medical Practitioners' Tribunal Service (MPTS) completed its hearing on 2 November. In a decision document posted on its website the MPTS said the allegation that led to the tribunal dated from 8 June 2012 and 6 February 2013 when Morgan-Rowe was a research fellow in the complex aorta treatment team at the Royal Free London National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust.

Morgan-Rowe currently works as a consultant interventional radiologist at the East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust and as head of medical education for peripheral vascular health in Western Europe at Medtronic U.K. according to his LinkedIn site accessed on 7 November.

The evidence

Initial concerns were raised at the Royal Free in February 2013 and the matter was referred to the NHS Counter Fraud Team. Morgan-Rowe was subsequently arrested and charged with criminal offences of fraud. At the Crown Court trial in 2016 the Crown Prosecution Service offered no evidence and a not-guilty verdict was recorded.

Between 16 September 2013 and 4 December 2015 Morgan-Rowe was under investigation for criminal offences of fraud in connection with the expense claims but during his work reviews he knowingly failed to disclose the investigation on four separate occasions the tribunal heard.

In his witness statement sent to the MPTS in September 2021 Morgan-Rowe admitted the allegation. ""I accept that my conduct at the time was dishonest and in recognition of the seriousness of my actions I accept that it amounts to misconduct"" he wrote.

In his oral evidence Morgan-Rowe said he claimed the money in advance for the hours he knew he would eventually work. He admitted this was not the normal way to receive payment for work but it had assisted with his debts at the time. He said it was never his intention to commit fraud.

Under examination

During cross-examination at last week's tribunal Morgan-Rowe said he is a different person now and had gained insight into the character traits that caused him to behave recklessly. He said he was in a stable financial position with personal checks and mechanisms in place to avoid repeating his behaviour in the future for example not making impulsive decisions.

He said he is involved in medical education work and was keen to continue his practice and maintain his clinical skills. He added that ""burying my head in the sand does not serve me"" and he had learnt from past mistakes through ""honest and open discussion and reflection"".

Morgan-Rowe said he was ""deeply disappointed in himself"" and sorry for his actions and the impact he had had on everyone involved. He said he had ""worked hard in the subsequent years to be an exceptional physician as evidenced in the references received by senior colleagues"". He had been ""buoyed up and edified by the letters of support and encouragement he had received since the episode of dishonesty and the letters from Lister Hospital.""

Morgan-Rowe said he would undertake an ethics and probity course and he would actively seek out formal mentoring and support. Also he would continue to develop his wider support network and make it ""a priority to be better organised when it came to record keeping.""

The verdict

On behalf of the General Medical Council Lee Fish accepted that Morgan-Rowe had expressed genuine remorse and insight but there had been ""two types of dishonesty repeated on multiple occasions"". He said there was ""a little bit more work to do"" and action had to be taken particularly because no undertakings had been offered in this case. He also noted that a suspension would have a deterrent effect.

Summing up the tribunal panel noted that as a result of his dishonesty Morgan-Rowe had gained a financial advantage.

""The dishonesty was persistent and had been sustained over a period of time. Dr. Morgan-Rowe had not stopped his behaviour of his own volition; rather he stopped the dishonest behaviour when his actions were discovered"" noted the decision document. ""The damage caused to the profession by submitting fraudulent timesheets on multiple occasions was significant and wide-ranging.

The MPTS concluded that ""his conduct fell far below the standards expected of a doctor"" and it was ""in no doubt that the misconduct in this case was serious professional misconduct."""

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL21lcmNrLXRyZWF0bWVudC10eXBlLXV0ZXJ1cy1jYW5jZXItZmFpbHMtdHJpYWwtMjAyNC0wNS0wOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-treatment-type-uterus-cancer-fails-trial-2024-05-09/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL21lcmNrLXRyZWF0bWVudC10eXBlLXV0ZXJ1cy1jYW5jZXItZmFpbHMtdHJpYWwtMjAyNC0wNS0wOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTbSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWFsdGguZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,"Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals Subscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.

The initiative supports the company’s work in expanding access to health and accelerating progress toward the U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goal 3 which aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all. More specifically it is focused on creating a world where no woman has to die while giving life by helping to address the first target under SDG 3 reducing the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100000 live births by 2030.

“I am so proud of our company’s longstanding commitment to our Merck for Mothers initiative which is dedicated to improving maternal health outcomes around the world” Allison Goldberg president Merck Foundation said. “Through Merck for Mothers we have now helped more than 30 million women access high-quality life-saving care around pregnancy and childbirth — surpassing our goal of reaching 25 million women by 2025. This milestone serves as a reminder that much work is left to be done and we remain committed to helping create a world where no woman has to die while giving life.”

Through wide-ranging approaches Merck for Mothers harnesses the power of public-private collaboration to strengthen health systems and mobilize solutions to address the diverse and unique needs of moms babies and families worldwide. The initiative’s milestone of 30 million women reached reflects the combined total impact of the programs and partnerships it supports in more than 70 countries including India Brazil Kenya Nigeria and the U.S.

The U.S. is the only high-income country in which maternal mortality is on the rise — where Merck for Mothers supports a variety of programs to address racial inequities in maternal health outcomes. For example with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Foundation Merck for Mothers created the Hear Her campaign to disseminate critical information on pregnancy and childbirth-related complications reaching more than 1.5 million people to date across the campaign’s website and social media channels."

The job cuts are expected to affect thousands of workers and the announcement could come as early as Wednesday The Wall Street Journal reported citing unnamed sources. Meta had more than 87000 employees as of the end of September according to a securities filing.

Meta declined to comment Monday about the reported layoffs.

The news of the wide-scale job cuts came after CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he expected Meta to enter 2023 with roughly the same headcount during the company’s third-quarter earnings call on Oct. 26.

“In 2023 we're going to focus our investments on a small number of high priority growth areas” Zuckerberg said. “In aggregate we expect to end 2023 as either roughly the same size or even a slightly smaller organization than we are today.”

Meta Platforms Inc. reported its revenue declined for a second consecutive quarter last month raising questions about the company’s plan to spend billions building the metaverse an immersive future online world.

Meta has been struggling financially for months as the company competes with newer social media platforms like TikTok for digital advertisement and increases its spending.

Zuckerberg warned employees in July about “one of the worst downturns that we've seen in recent history” and announced a hiring freeze in September according to reports.

Wave of layoffs at tech companies

With the reportedly planned layoffs Meta joins a number of tech companies that have recently announced job cuts or hiring freezes after rapid growth during the pandemic as employers fear the U.S. could enter a recession.

Facebook rival Twitter last Friday began mass layoffs a week after Elon Musk’s takeover that affected half of the company’s workforce of more than 7500 full-time employees. The company reportedly began reaching out to dozens of employees to ask them to return according to Bloomberg.

E-commerce giant Amazon announced last week that it’s pausing incremental corporate hiring because the economy is “in an uncertain place.”

Lyft meanwhile said it will lay off 13% of its employees or about 700 workers. Payment processing platform Stripe said it’s reducing its headcount by about 14%.

“We were much too optimistic about the internet economy’s near-term growth in 2022 and 2023 and underestimated both the likelihood and impact of a broader slowdown” Stripe CEO Patrick Collison said in a note to employees.

What is Meta?

Zuckerberg announced last year that Facebook (the company not the social media platform) was changing its name to Meta to reflect the company's focus on the metaverse which will take years to develop.

Meta owns Facebook Messenger Instagram and WhatsApp. Reality Labs makes the company's augmented and virtual reality products.

Meta Facebook's parent company is planning mass layoffs this week according to The Wall Street Journal. The news outlet reported Monday that this will impact thousands of Meta employees. As of September Meta currently employs over 87000 people.

This round of layoffs would be the first of its size in the history of the company. The announcement is expected to occur as early as Wednesday this week with company officials reportedly telling employees to cancel any non-essential travel according to the WSJ.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made recent statements about the company's priorities during Meta's third-quarter earnings call.

""In 2023 we're going to focus our investments on a small number of high priority growth areas. So that means some teams will grow meaningfully but most other teams will stay flat or shrink over the next year"" Zuckerberg said.

""In aggregate we expect to end 2023 as either roughly the same size or even a slightly smaller organization than we are today"" he said.

Meta's stock has fallen by over 70 percent this year. Some like the Journal attribute this to Zuckerberg's steadfast conviction — and spending — towards the metaverse including Horizon Worlds the company's flagship metaverse offering and Reality Lab the company's AR and VR headset division.

The news comes as Twitter has similarly directed a wave of layoffs in the past week since Elon Musk acquired the social media company. The tech industry on the whole is facing these dire circumstances: from Microsoft to Snap announcements of job cuts are pouring through."

While The Mirage will have a new owner by year's end guests shouldn't expect any major changes just yet.

While The Mirage will have a new owner by year’s end guests shouldn’t expect any major changes just yet.

As the iconic Strip resort prepares to switch ownership from MGM Resorts International to Hard Rock International who acquired the operations of the resort for $1.08 billion last year questions have loomed about how the transition will play out.

To answer the first question likely on everyone’s mind: No the volcano show won’t close — yet.

Officials have previously said the attraction will be torn down but “there are no current plans to change the volcano show” according to MGM Resorts.

MGM also answered several other questions on its website about The Mirage’s future through a FAQ page shared this month.

Hard Rock owned by the Seminole Tribe of Florida is expected to keep the property’s name and brand for a bit longer. Part of its sale agreement includes the ability to stay branded as The Mirage for up to three years. The company expects to unveil the “property expansion” in 2025 according to a July news release.

The transfer of ownership to Hard Rock is expected to be finalized by Dec. 31 once approved by Nevada gaming regulators.

“We look to ensure a good experience for our guests with little change or disruption” Hard Rock Las Vegas’ President Joe Lupo said in a statement Monday. “We will be implementing Hard Rock’s Unity Rewards which is available in over 150 locations throughout the United States and around the world.”

Hotel guests with upcoming stays booked during or after the expected transition time will have their reservations honored including comp reservations. Reservation confirmation numbers will remain the same through the transition.

Benefits through MGM Rewards such as priority cab lines check-ins and parking will still be available until the transaction closes according to the FAQ page. Any loyalty program offer booked before the transaction closes will be honored.

Rewards members that frequent the Mirage will keep their tier status and credits and points balances won’t change. They’ll be accruable and usable at other MGM Rewards properties the company said. MGM Rewards and Unity by Hard Rock the company’s loyalty program offers tier matching.

Slot machine cashout vouchers as well as casino chips that say MGM Resorts will still be redeemable after the Hard Rock takes over the company said.

Officials said they don’t expect to close the casino floor after the ownership transfers.

“There could be downtimes after the closing of the transaction as new systems are installed but we are working diligently to mitigate any disruption” according to MGM’s FAQ sheet.

“The CHIPS Act gives us an opportunity to look at ways we can bring back some of the investments we’ve made overseas and bring those back to Corvallis” Tuan Tran HP’s president of imaging and printing said at an event last month at the company’s campus there.

HP wants to bring its development prototyping and manufacturing back under one roof Tran said if it can capture a share of the $52 billion the Commerce Department plans to begin allocating early next year.

“Thanks to that we will be able to continue to invest expand our capabilities here” said CEO Enrique Lores who also attended the event.

Some Oregon economic development officials are pessimistic that the state will land a meaningful share of CHIPS Act funding lamenting that Oregon hadn’t positioned itself soon enough to capitalize on the opportunity.

But U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden who attended the Corvallis event hailed HP’s plans as a symbol of Oregon’s opportunity and said he’s confident the state’s manufacturers can land significant funding if lawmakers move quickly on proposals to improve Oregon’s competitive position.

“Oregonians want their elected officials to get this done today. Don’t wait until 2023” Wyden said in an interview Friday.

Gov. Kate Brown is readying a legislative package for lawmakers to consider on “day one” of their next session which begins in late January. Proposals focus on increasing available industrial land boosting tax incentives streamlining environmental regulations and adding worker training.

Microchip Technology is contemplating a second factory at its Gresham site. The project would cost $3 billion to $5 billion and add several hundred jobs but the company hasn’t decided whether to build in Oregon or somewhere else in the U.S.

Microchip CEO Ganesh Moorthy told Wall Street analysts last week that “The availability of grants subsidies and other incentives will all be important considerations in our analysis and will also help determine the location and timing for the fab.”

Late last month Wyden met with Moorthy and Microchip employees at the Gresham site and the senator said they discussed the expansion plans.

“I left very encouraged by the meeting” Wyden said.

Legions of electronics manufacturers are positioning themselves for a share of the CHIPS Act money and even at $52 billion it’s clear that demand for the federal subsidies will handily outpace supply. So it’s hard to gauge how HP or any other company will fare in its pursuit of funds.

HP declined to elaborate on how many jobs it might add in Corvallis and didn’t say how much it’s seeking in federal support. It doesn’t appear the company is contemplating a new Oregon factory like Microchip.

Still restoring some work to Corvallis would be a significant reversal for HP after years of cuts. (HP is also planning to move its Vancouver operations to a new campus in 2026. That decision predates the CHIPS Act.)

HP invented its inkjet printer in Corvallis and the site remains one of the Silicon Valley company’s leading research sites. But HP has steadily reduced its manufacturing footprint there over many years both due to declines in its printer business and because it has shifted more production to Asia.

As recently as this fall HP had been furloughing workers in its Corvallis printer supply factor amid falling demand.

Now though it appears HP envisions the federal money as an opportunity to reinvigorate its Oregon operations.

“HP Corvallis is home to some of the most cutting-edge MEMS (Micro Electrical Mechanical Systems) and Microfluidics R&D and manufacturing in the world” the company said in a written statement. “It’s a hub of innovation for HP and we are committed to investing in our future.”

Yet global supply chain disruption persists because it is not caused by a lack of data– which is why more IoT may not the answer. The real answer lies in creating effective connections between numerous stakeholders performing a range of functions across multiple enterprise platforms and in different jurisdictions. Until now that has been easier said than done.

Achieving visibility in parts of the supply chain that involve goods moving between physical locations and stakeholders is difficult due to the number of independent organizations involved. It is comparatively simple to digitize a factory– with everything under one roof and controlled by one organization. But an entire global supply chain is a very different matter. Mobile devices enable single stakeholders to track and monitor outside their respective domains. However the cost of such devices is prohibitive and they present operational challenges such as maintenance and retrieval.

As a result although there is no shortage of data to achieve granular visibility throughout the supply chain it is fragmented across a variety of siloed systems each owned operated and controlled by different independent organizations. To unlock the benefits the data needs to be captured and combined while maintaining privacy between the respective organizations and very different data needs to be brought together in a way that can deliver the coherent visibility required.

New data mesh technology is now providing a breakthrough and unlocking value from even the most challenging supply chains through the use of intelligent data orchestration. Data mesh is based on distributed architecture for analytical data management and enables end users to easily access and query data where it lives without first transporting it to a data lake or data warehouse.

This means data from multiple supply chain systems can be captured and combined to create a 'digital twin' of a consignment– providing a single data product from which all stakeholders can get the visibility they need. Leveraging data across the supply chain enables a much fuller picture to be achieved at a granular level. And as the data is from existing systems used in the day-to-day running of the various organizations it is of high quality can be trusted and the systems are well maintained.

Intelligent data orchestration is then what connects and harmonizes the different supply chain systems in a way that allows them to work together. Just like in a traditional orchestra a 'conductor' takes center stage and synchronizes all the various data inputs. Each separate system communicates directly and only to the conductor platform– removing the need for numerous discrete connections and maintaining data integrity. As each digital twin is created proprietary algorithms define and assign policies to it to ensure only relevant data is captured from each connected system.

Data from order management and transport management systems is combined with more real-time data sources from other systems present across the supply chain. For example consignment and inventory data can be combined with transport schedules and allocated transport. The telematics system of the associated transport vehicle provides real-time location and condition data from the consignment which when combined with analytics generates detailed consignment lifecycle records capturing key events throughout. These events can be communicated across the supply chain improving communication and paving the way to automation of processes.

Being able to interact with all data for a single consignment in a single place can have a profound impact on business operations. For example better equipped customer service agents can reduce call handling times due to having all information easily accessible helping to reduce the overall administrative burden of many online B2C businesses.

In the middle-mile goods-in teams can be better prepared to receive products and the receipt of a product can be notified to all stakeholders involved streamlining the invoicing process. What’s more in both these examples delivering key updates to relevant stakeholders can reduce the number of phone calls received.

The increasing complexity of supply chains is making optimization more challenging than ever while the cost of inefficiencies is growing. Research suggests that businesses with optimal supply chains can halve their inventory holdings reduce their supply chain costs by 15% and triple the speed of their cash-to-cash cycle. Data mesh and intelligent data orchestration are now providing a new route to unlock supply chain value and deliver competitive advantage.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnN0cnVjdGlvbmVxdWlwbWVudGd1aWRlLmNvbS9taWNyb24tdG8tYnVpbGQtbWFtbW90aC0zMWItc2VtaWNvbmR1Y3Rvci1jaGlwLXBsYW50LW5lYXItc3lyYWN1c2UtbnkvNTg2MjjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Micron to Build Mammoth $31B Semiconductor Chip Plant Near Syracuse : CEG,"The semiconductor chip factory is slated to be constructed in Clay’s White Pine Commerce Park. (Rendering courtesy of Micron)

The computer memory chip specialist Micron has launched a plan to create an enormous manufacturing complex in the town of Clay N.Y. north of Syracuse by investing $31 billion to build four 600000-sq.-ft. ""clean rooms"" on the site Spectrum News 1 in Syracuse reported.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul noted that the Onondaga County facility roughly 40 football fields in size will make it one of the largest construction projects in North America. In addition the project is expected to create 5600 related construction jobs according to a news release from her office.

The semiconductor chip factory is slated to be constructed in Clay's White Pine Commerce Park. With it comes the potential for bringing tens of thousands of jobs to the region U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer said during a news conference unveiling the project in October.

In all Micron will invest $100 billion over 20 years which according to Schumer is the largest private investment in New York state history and is set to provide 50000 jobs throughout the area with 9000 working directly for the company. The average starting salary for a Micron employee is $109000 he added.

Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra noted that when fully built the plant will produce nearly four billion chips a year.

He credited President Joe Biden as well as the federal CHIPS and Science Act authored by Schumer for setting the foundation for the plant. The measure designed to revitalize domestic manufacturing and strengthen supply chains was signed into law by the President in August.

""The combined efforts at the federal state and local level paved the way for Micron to realize the largest private investment ever made in New York state history"" Mehrotra said. ""We are thrilled to make this significant investment in New York making the Empire State the location of the biggest leading-edge memory site in the U.S.""

Micron employs 48000 people in 17 countries and is the fourth largest semiconductor company in the world.

""We chose this location for many reasons but most importantly — central New York offers a rich pool of diverse talent including communities that traditionally have been underrepresented in technology jobs"" Mehrotra told Spectrum News 1.

The White Pine Commerce Park is a 1200-acre site near Caughdenoy Road and New York Highway 31. Site preparation for the Micron complex is going to begin in 2023 followed by the start of heavy construction in 2024 the news outlet learned.

On a visit to Syracuse Oct. 27 President Biden pointed to Micron's decision to build the major semiconductor facility in the region as a harbinger of what is to come.

""A century ago this region was the heartland of manufacturing and now the region is poised to lead the world in advanced manufacturing"" Biden remarked from the stage at Onondaga Community College's SRC Arena and Event Center.

""We're here to celebrate one of the most significant investments in American history and it's going to ensure that the future is made in America"" he continued. ""It's part of a broader story of the economy we're building that will work for everyone.""

Call Goes Out for Tech Construction Jobs

The building of a semiconductor fabrication or chip fab campus employing thousands of high-paying tech jobs will undoubtedly lift the region's fortunes in a way not seen for decades national experts told Syracuse.com the online edition of the Post-Standard newspaper.

But there is one major obstacle that could slow that progress: Who will fill all those jobs?

The work of a chip fab — etching eight billion tiny transistors onto a silicon memory chip the size of a fingernail — is specialized to put it mildly. That does not mean it requires a Ph.D. but every position requires some level of specialized training.

Even the construction jobs to build the facilities require special training.

That means high schools community colleges and universities working in unison to prepare students for careers at Micron and related businesses said Mike Russo president and CEO at the National Institute for Innovation and Technology a government-funded nonprofit that facilitates work force development for semiconductor companies.

""They should look at it as a generational change for that region and really bring together a concerted effort to develop that talent pipeline"" he noted.

Even before the new fab clean rooms are built experts see some potential for a shortage of construction workers capable of overseeing work on them.

Micron's site in Clay will provide plenty of jobs for local building trades but they will have to be trained and supervised by specialists who are familiar with the complexities of building a fab said Joe Stockunas president of SEMI Americas part of SEMI a global trade group representing semiconductor manufacturers and suppliers.

But those specialists are in limited supply he told Syracuse.com.

Equipment in a fabrication plant is expensive and highly sensitive Stockunas said. One of the key tools a lithography system for putting integrated circuits on the chips costs about $150 million. Any buildings housing them must be built and outfitted to exacting standards.

""I don't know anything that competes with this level of precision"" he admitted. ""The welders the pipe fitters the construction trades they're all going to go through some sort of a training program and then be supervised by folks who understand the complexities of what has to be done special.""

More than 10 years ago at the height of construction at Global Foundries a chip fab in nearby Saratoga County employed more than 3500 workers on site and the company was spending $4.4 million a day on wages and materials. Russo who worked for Global Foundries before founding his nonprofit said there will be more competition now for workers to build fabs.

""If you are used to building an office building or a house that's different than building a semiconductor fab"" he noted. ""There are definitely different skill sets involved.""

New Infrastructure Also Needed Around Clay N.Y.

The Syracuse area and the northern suburbs could experience rapid growth from the Micron endeavor. Now is the time to start planning for that advised Dennis Brobston president of the Saratoga Economic Development Corp. which helped lure Global Foundries to the small rural town of Malta.

""It's all about traffic"" he added.

Even now 13 years after Global Foundries broke ground for its $15 billion facility the Malta area suffers from unanticipated traffic congestion on certain roads and intersections he said.

Congestion is already prevalent on N.Y. 31 in and around the Micron property. State transportation officials have committed to spend $200 million on road and infrastructure improvements around the fab site said Ryan McMahon an executive with Onondaga County.

""Traffic will actually get better because of the improvements that will have to be made"" McMahon explained to Syracuse.com.

In addition central New York will need more housing Brobston said more hotels for construction workers and others with temporary assignments at the chip factory as well as new daycare facilities and schools.

Micron's semiconductor facility in Clay is likely to draw employees from abroad too at least in the early years. When the plant starts production as early as 2025 many of the first employees will be experienced staff from other fabs Stockunas told the Syracuse news source. Most of Micron's manufacturing facilities are in Asia.

""They'll definitely be bringing in experienced folks"" he said.

Memory Chips Heart of Everyday Technology

Semiconductors help convert power from a standard outlet into the electricity needed for any given electronic device. They are found in many everyday devices from smartphones to appliances to vehicles.

Micron manufactures chips for computer memory and storage uses like memory cards and solid-state drives.

The ability to use voice-to-text technology on your smartphone advanced safety features in your car and precise medical imaging in doctor's offices depend on fast and accurate data Mehrotra said at the SRC Arena.

Work in the memory space makes access to data easy and therefore it is ""at the heart of all of these technology applications today"" he said. ""We are the clear technology leader in memory and we're now bringing that leadership in technology and manufacturing excellence to right here in Clay New York.""

During the COVID-19 pandemic demand soared for semiconductors also referred to as ""chips"" and the United States scrambled to strengthen domestic manufacturing to stave off consumers' dependence on imported chips from overseas.

Update: 20 percent bit density increase statement removed; 10 November 2023.

The K90VGK8J8B chip uses Sammy’s gen 8 V-NAND (Vertical-NAND) technology with we understand 236 layers and cells organised into TLC (3 bits/cell format). It uses a Toggle DDR5 interface transferring data at 2400Mbps.

SungHoi Hur Flash Product & Technology EVP at Samsung Electronics said: “Samsung has adopted its advanced 3D scaling technology to reduce surface area and height while avoiding the cell-to-cell interference that normally occurs with scaling down.”

Samsung 1Tbit Gen 8 V-NAND chip

Samsung said it was able to attain the industry’s highest bit density by significantly enhancing the bit productivity per wafer. It’s latest chip is a good fit for SSDs using the PCIe gen 4 interface and doubled speed PCIe gen 5.

The 236-layer count is 34 per cent more than its 7th generation 3D NAND with a 176-layer count. This combined two 88-layer sections rather than building a single 176-layer device; a technology termed string stacking. Samsung has not revealed whether the 236-layer chip is string-stacked. A major problem with 150-plus layer chips is that the etching of holes through the layers becomes progressively more difficult as the layer count increases with the hole geometry becoming irregular.

SK hynix is sample shipping a 238-layer count 512Gbit chip half the capacity of Sammy’s latest NAND chip. It is due to enter mass production in the first half of 2023.

B&F table showing NAND supplier layer count progression

NAND fab partners Kioxia and Western Digital are at the 212-layer point. Micron has 232-layer technology in development as does China’s YMTC. Micron is delaying a production ramp of the 232-layer chip due to the deteriorating economic situation which has adversely affected its earnings. YMTC’s development is expected to be slowed by US Technology export restrictions.

Samsung has not announced any SSD products that use its 1Tb chips. Its FMS 2022 booth and presentations mentioned several SSDs that could use it.

Were Samsung to produce a QLC (4bits/cell) version of its latest chip the capacity would be a third higher at 1.33Tbit.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS8wNy9taWNyb24tcmVhY2hpbmctbWlsZXN0b25lcy1pbi1zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Micron reaching milestones in sustainability,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://themalaysianreserve.com/2022/11/07/micron-reaching-milestones-in-sustainability/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS8wNy9taWNyb24tcmVhY2hpbmctbWlsZXN0b25lcy1pbi1zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zeXJhY3VzZS5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMi8xMS9ncmVhdC1ub3J0aGVybi1tYWxscy1zZWxsZXItYWdhaW4tc2F5cy10ZW5hbnRzLW11c3QtdmFjYXRlLWluLTEzLWRheXMtaW0taW4tcGFuaWMtbW9kZS5odG1s0gGUAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN5cmFjdXNlLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyLzExL2dyZWF0LW5vcnRoZXJuLW1hbGxzLXNlbGxlci1hZ2Fpbi1zYXlzLXRlbmFudHMtbXVzdC12YWNhdGUtaW4tMTMtZGF5cy1pbS1pbi1wYW5pYy1tb2RlLmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Great Northern Mall’s seller again says tenants must vacate in 13 days: ‘I’m in panic mode’,"Clay N.Y. – Tenants in Great Northern Mall are once again being told they have to leave the nearly empty shopping center this month according to a tenant and the mall’s buyer.

In late October the mall’s tenants were given a hand-delivered letter informing them the shopping center would close Nov. 20 and their leases were being terminated. The letter came from Mike Kohan the current owner of the mall.

Tenants were upset and as of early last week Kohan had changed his mind after talking with Guy Hart Jr. the local developer who is buying the mall. Kohan had agreed to give the tenants more time.

Now that’s changed again.

Tenants were informed by mall management Monday that the Nov. 20 date to close the mall is back on. The text sent by the mall’s manager said they have to vacate by then according to one tenant who shared that text with syracuse.com | The Post-Standard.

Hart the developer buying the mall confirmed that. He told syracuse.com “we learned this morning that the seller reversed the statement that tenants would be given more time.”

Hart said the contract with Kohan specifies the mall has to clear of tenants before the mall’s sale is final. But Hart said he offered to delay the real estate closing somewhat to give tenants a bit more time.

Still Hart said he doesn’t own the mall yet and isn’t the one calling the shots.

Derek Potocki who runs a wrestling school at the mall and a live theater said he’s beside himself after learning he has to close his businesses within a couple of weeks.

“I’m in panic mode’' he said.

Potocki said he believes tenants have to be given 30 days notice but he’s not sure what to do about it.

He told syracuse.com | The Post-Standard he and others were notified by the mall manager Nov. 20 is the date the mall will shut down.

Kohan did not answer his phone this afternoon.

Hart is buying the mall and plans to convert it into a “lifestyle center” with luxury apartments and townhomes a movie theater and hotel high-end shops and restaurants fueled by Micron Technology’s decision to locate in Clay.

The President is right–particularly about the changes we’re seeing in the technology sector.

For about forty years the American technology sector has been synonymous with Silicon Valley. Even tech’s other hubs–places like Boston and Austin–have economies that largely resemble the Bay Area’s with most innovation happening in front of a keyboard and monitor; engineers developing the apps programs and platforms that occupy our digital lives.

This is an important model of innovation. But we need to remember that the future of America’s tech sector will be built on both the software and the hardware it runs on a model where innovation is undertaken by researchers at labs and workers in manufacturing facilities–not just programmers in office buildings.

Put another way the future of the American tech sector will look as much like the Hudson Valley as it does Silicon Valley. In many ways it already does.

The swath of land that extends up the Hudson River from Westchester County to Albany is the original capital of America’s computing industry. From the 1960s to the ‘90s it’s where IBM developed and manufactured the hardware advances that were foundational to the software breakthroughs that came later. Our modern computing and business environments wouldn’t exist without the mainframe.

The ecosystem that created these products is still here. It’s not just because of companies like IBM but also thanks to the talent coming from the vibrant university ecosystem that is present in the State of New York from SUNY Marist College and Rensselaer Polytechnic to Columbia Cornell and beyond. It is also the result of a state government that’s willing to support the development and manufacturing of these products.

Today America is realizing that we need to invest in this kind of tech hubs again–especially after the recent chip shortage.

America invented the semiconductor and its associated industry but on the eve of the pandemic our country only manufactured 12% of the world’s chips and none of its most advanced. We paid a price for that. There was a pandemic-induced supply crunch on everything from cars to smartphones which caused an unfortunate spike in prices. The country is recovering now but the data show our semiconductor shortage reduced economic output by a full percentage point.

And America doesn’t just need to manufacture more chips–it needs to accelerate the field of computing. More sophisticated artificial intelligence for example requires increasingly advanced chips: faster yet smaller; more powerful yet more energy efficient. Other problems–like finding the precisely correct chemical structure for advanced materials–have pushed traditional computing methods to the limit. Solving them will require an entirely new approach which will be made possible by the very type of quantum computers that IBM is pioneering in the Hudson Valley.

This was the rationale behind the historic and bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act that President Biden signed in August. The idea–which was championed by leaders from both parties like Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Senator Todd Young (R-IN)–was to use public funds to both reverse the erosion of U.S. competitiveness in semiconductors and catalyze tens of billions of dollars in private investment. The money would spur the development of new chip-making hubs drive research and development into advanced computing and spur regional economic development.

If there was any equivocation that the CHIPS strategy would work what happened during the last month in New York should put it to rest.

IBM announced $20 billion to support our work in the Hudson Valley which includes developing many future generations of mainframes quantum computers and advanced semiconductors. This comes on the heels of the chip manufacturer Micron committing $100 billion over the next two decades to develop a giant semiconductor factory in Clay New York–140 miles west of Malta New York where another chip manufacturer GlobalFoundries had already announced an expansion.

These investments will create local economies that look very different from your traditional tech hubs because they’ll benefit a much broader array of people–not just computer engineers but factory and lab workers.

Since the 1970s the lion’s share of America’s capital and talent has flowed to a few superstar cities creating what some economists have termed “durable islands of wealth and poverty.” The Hudson Valley model can help unwind this economic phenomenon because it brings so many more of us along. As President Biden relayed to the media after meeting Poughkeepsie IBMers “You do not need an advanced degree… to be making $120000 a year.”

This of course will be a decades-long project. Among other things it will require the smart implementation of the CHIPS and Science Act. Having New York play a key role in the National Semiconductor Technology Center for example would supercharge the state’s ongoing economic and workforce development and greatly augment U.S. competitiveness.

In the years ahead while Congress and the Biden Administration will certainly not agree on everything expanding the geography of innovation in our country is one of the most important endeavors we need to pursue. The Hudson Valley which is reinventing itself as the home to the future of computing is an inspiring model for what is possible when government industry and academia join forces around a unified vision. The task ahead is monumental but we will get it done–and it’s an effort all parties should get behind.

IT leaders today advise on a breadth of capital expenditures and play an increasingly central role in the employee experience—occasionally resulting in a complex patchwork of tools and solutions to support and manage.

Microsoft Ignite: Unlock new experiences across Microsoft 365 to lower costs and empower employees Watch the on-demand session

Now more than ever IT leaders need to reduce cost and complexity while empowering a digitally connected and distributed workforce in an uncertain economic environment. Microsoft 365 is the cloud-first platform that brings together the capabilities organizations need in a secure integrated experience—powered by data and AI—to help people work better and smarter.

Do more with less

A new Total Economic Impact™ of Microsoft 365 E3 study by Forrester Consulting commissioned by Microsoft found that adopting Microsoft 365 E3 saved composite organizations USD1500 per user per year with a return on investment of 205 percent and a payback period of less than three months. The report details three ways organizations can reduce cost and complexity with Microsoft 365:

Eliminate redundant solutions. Moving to Microsoft 365 E3 the composite organization can cut licensing spending by an average of USD55 per user per month—a 60 percent reduction in per-user licensing costs—while also reducing device spending by another 23 percent. We’ve heard from IT leaders about the redundant and overlapping solutions they’ve been asked to support over the last two years. This latest study shows how Microsoft 365 can help free you to cut redundant licenses for products across communications chat and collaboration file sharing endpoint management email storage mobile device management identity and access management information protection and labeling and endpoint protection. Simplify IT management. Moving to Microsoft 365 E3 the composite organization can reduce time spent deploying and managing new software by 25 percent using Microsoft Azure Active Directory and Microsoft Intune decrease endpoint configuration times by 75 percent by using Windows Autopilot reduce the time required to set up a user on a new endpoint by 75 percent by leveraging Microsoft’s modern application stack and eliminate 15 percent of help desk tickets while reducing time to resolve remaining tickets by another 15 percent.

RAM: 16GB

Storage: 512GB

Display: 15-inch Pixel Sense (2496 x 1664)

Battery: 9:01

Size: 13.4 x 9.6 x 0.6 inches

Weight: 3.4 pounds

The Surface Laptop 5 is like the second child you have because the first one was such a paragon of intelligence athleticism and mannerliness but terror sets in when you realize your new spawn is the complete opposite: an impish miscreant you must endure for the next 18+ years. Dun dun dun!

In the same way the AMD-based Surface Laptop 4 was pretty damn good. It had an incredible 12-hour battery life a solid display speedy performance and a few other goodies. But then Microsoft decided to birth the Surface Laptop 5 — facepalm! We thought we’d get a slightly better iteration compared to last year’s model. Boy were we wrong.

Microsoft packed the 15-inch Surface Laptop 5 with brand spankin’ new 12th Gen Intel Core i7 processors and boasted that it’s 50% faster than the Surface Laptop 4 but we’re seeing nothing close to that. The Surface Laptop 5 took a major hit in many critical areas making us wonder “Why would anyone purchase the Surface Laptop 5 over the Surface Laptop 4?”

While the Surface Laptop 5 has plenty of alluring features including spectacular sub-keyboard speakers and a satisfying keyboard I’m not convinced these are sufficient enough to overshadow its major setbacks.

Microsoft Surface Laptop 5 price

The 15-inch Surface Laptop 5 has a starting price of $1399 at Microsoft’s official website . The cheapest configuration comes with a 12th Gen Intel Core i7-1265U processor Intel Iris Xe graphics 8GB of DDR5 RAM 256GB of SSD storage and a 15-inch PixelSense touch display with 2496 x 1664-pixel resolution and a 3:2 aspect ratio.

Microsoft Surface Laptop 5 (Image credit: Future)

To upgrade your storage to a 512GB SSD you’ll have to shell out $1599. If 8GB of RAM isn’t enough you can kick that up a notch to 16GB of RAM for $1799. A fully tricked-out 15-inch Surface Laptop 5 will set you back $2499 and comes with a 12th Gen Intel Core i7-1265U CPU Intel Iris Xe graphics 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD.

Microsoft Surface Laptop 5 design

Wow! The Surface Laptop 5 is a 15-inch all-aluminum sophisticated beaute. The first thing I noticed when I pulled the Microsoft laptop out of the box is its large-and-lithe silver chassis. The second thing I noticed? “Why are the bezels so damn big?” I opened the lid and was disappointed to see a thick frame enveloping the PixelSense display. Womp womp!

Microsoft Surface Laptop 5 (Image credit: Future)

Defending the Surface Laptop 5 I thought “Maybe the bezels are thick in order to accommodate a really good webcam?” However as you’ll find out in the webcam section that is not the case. As such the Surface Laptop 5 looks outdated and passé in 2022.

The deck isn’t much to write home about. There’s an island-style keyboard that features white letters and symbols superimposed on gray keys. Yawn. Below the spacebar is a gray buttonless trackpad — more yawn.

Closing the lid I spotted the lustrous center-positioned Microsoft logo winking at me as it glimmered under the light. On the underside there are four rounded rubberized feet placed on all corners of the Surface Laptop 5 ensuring it remains slightly elevated from surfaces. Near the hinge there’s a vent.

Our Surface Laptop 5 unit is the Platinum variant but you can also snag a configuration that comes in Matte Black. The Surface Laptop 5 has dimensions of 13.4 x 9.6 x 0.58 inches and it weighs 3.44 pounds. Its rivals the M2 MacBook Air (11.97 x 8.46 x 0.44 inches 2.7 pounds) and the 2022 Acer Swift 5 (12.22 x 8.4 x 0.59 inches 2.65 pounds) are about as slim as the Microsoft laptop but they’re both lighter. It’s also worth noting the Surface Laptop 5 has the same dimensions as the 15-inch AMD-packed Surface Laptop 4 we reviewed last year.

Microsoft Surface Laptop 5 ports

You may be wondering “What I/O options do I have with the Surface Laptop 5?” Well you’ll be delighted to know that the Microsoft laptop comes with a decent selection of legacy and modern ports. It’s not teeming with variety but it’ll do for most folks.

Microsoft Surface Laptop 5 (Image credit: Future)

On the left side you’ll find a USB 3.1 Type-A port a USB-C port with USB4 and Thunderbolt 4 support (finally) and a 3.5mm headphone jack. On the right side you’ll find a Surface Connect port.

If the Surface Laptop 5’s connectivity options come up short for you consider getting a reliable docking station or USB-C hub .

Microsoft Surface Laptop 5 display

The Surface Laptop 5’s display spaciousness is the shining star of the laptop — there’s plenty of screen real estate to enjoy. The panel is a 15-inch PixelSense display with a 2496 x 1664-pixel resolution a step up from the Surface Laptop 4’s 2256 x 1504-pixel display. I’m also pleased to see that Microsoft retained the 3:2 aspect ratio on its new-gen laptop.

As mentioned I hate the thick bezels. If I saw this laptop sitting on someone’s desk I’d snobbily assume that it’s several years old but nope this is a 2022 laptop. Gross!

The Surface Laptop 5 features a touch display so you’ll have the opportunity to free yourself from the confines of your keyboard and utilize your favorite touch gestures on the screen. The Surface Laptop 5’s panel responded quickly to my taps and swipes including pinching for zooming and three-fingered swipes to reveal the desktop.

Microsoft Surface Laptop 5 (Image credit: Future)

I watched the Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania trailer on the Surface Laptop 5. I was slightly irked by the letterboxing that flanked the video (YouTube’s standard aspect ratio is 16:9) but it’s a minor nuisance. I could see that the glam team behind Kathryn Newton the actress who plays Cassie Lang (Ant-Man’s daughter) ensured that every single hair on her eyebrow was brushed upward reflecting the hot new trend in the beauty industry. In some scenes I could even see her tiny pores.

As Cassie and Ant-Man accidentally stumbled onto a secret unfamiliar world I was wowed by the swirling purple pink and yellow hues that painted the sky but I wished they were richer more vivid. Perhaps I’ve been too spoiled by reviewing OLED laptops but believe me the Surface Laptop 5’s screen won’t win any awards. Still it’s sharp and crisp enough to be satisfactory for the average consumer.

Now let’s see if the numbers match my experience. We measured the Surface Laptop 5’s color reproduction and it registered 71.6% of the DCI-P3 color gamut. Unfortunately this falls below the average laptop (88.6%). It also failed to beat the M2 MacBook Air (75.9%) and the Acer Swift 5 (93.3%). To add salt to Microsoft’s wounds it didn’t even outdo the Surface Laptop 4 (77.8%).

The Surface Laptop 5's 0.25 Delta-E color accuracy score mirrors the average premium laptop (closer to 0 is better). However the M2 MacBook Air (0.20) Acer Swift 3 (0.23) and the Surface Laptop 4 (0.23) are all more color accurate than the Microsoft laptop.

Microsoft Surface Laptop 5 (Image credit: Future)

This isn’t the most outdoor-friendly laptop either. In other words you may find the screen difficult to see if you decide to work outside on a sunny day. The Surface Laptop 5 has a 384-nit screen which is dimmer than the average premium laptop (427 nits). The M2 MacBook Air is a shining star with its 489-nit panel; the Acer Swift 5 isn’t half bad either with a 457-nit display. Fortunately for the Surface Laptop 5 it did outshine the Surface Laptop 4’s 334-nit screen.

Microsoft Surface Laptop 5 keyboard and touchpad

Get this guys! My typing average is typically around 87 words per minute give or take. Imagine my surprise when I typed at 96 wpm with a 97% accuracy rate on the 10FastFingers.com test. That’s nearly 10 wpm more than usual. Wow!

Microsoft Surface Laptop 5 (Image credit: Future)

The island-style keyboard with 1.3mm of key travel features Chiclet keys with bouncy switches acting like a trampoline for my fingers allowing them to fly from one letter to another. For some laptops it takes some time to get accustomed to the keyboard but with the Surface Laptop 5 I felt right at home.

Before I move on to the touchpad Microsoft claims that the Surface Laptop 5 keyboard facilitates “whisper quiet” typing. Bullcrap! Let’s just hope you don’t find yourself needing to type a “help me!” email to a loved one while a killer lurks nearby. It’s not deafeningly loud but this keyboard is definitely a clacker.

The 4.6 x 3.1-inch touchpad is slightly larger than the Surface Laptop 4’s 4.5 x 3-inch touchpad. It feels so soft but yet it has just the right amount of resistance to make the clicking swiping and everything in between feel smooth and seamless. I had no issues executing Windows 11 gestures like two-finger scrolling pinch-to-zoom and three finger swipes to change windows.

Microsoft Surface Laptop 5 audio

When I found out that Microsoft placed Dolby Atmos-tuned Omnisonic speakers underneath the keyboard I side-eyed the OEM but holy schnitzel they actually sound divine!

Microsoft Surface Laptop 5 (Image credit: Future)

After just a few seconds of listening to “N’y pense plus” by Tayc I had to pause the song because I couldn’t believe my ears — it sounded well-balanced and velvety! The famous “Yimmy yimmy yimmy yimmy” vocalizations made popular by TikTok sounded as sweet as funnel cake. The heartfelt swoon-worthy crooning from the Cameroonian artist coupled with the punchy catchy base sounded as smooth as melted butter on the Surface Laptop 5.

At maximum volume the Afropop tune still sounded great. It didn’t get as loud as I expected it to but that’s fine for me because I’m not a fan of amplification that damn-near blasts my ears out anyway. It still managed to fill my medium-sized testing room.

Microsoft Surface Laptop 5 performance

Temper your expectations dear reader. The 12th Gen Intel Core i7 1265U CPU packed inside the Surface Laptop 5 isn’t designed to be a performance beast. After all it is a U-series chip; U stands for ultra-low power. These chips are great for slim lightweight laptops because they’re less likely to overheat but they don’t deliver top-of-the-line performance.

Microsoft Surface Laptop 5 (Image credit: Future)

As such I didn’t expect the Surface Laptop 5 to beat the MacBook Air’s Roadrunner-esque M2 chip on the Geekbench 5.4 overall performance test — and my assumptions were correct. The Microsoft laptop notched a multi-core score of 6560 while the MacBook Air achieved an incredible score of 8919. The Acer Swift with an Intel Core i7-1260P CPU crushed both the Surface Laptop 5 and the M2 MacBook Air with a shocking score of 9859. However what I wasn’t anticipating was a generation-over-generation setback in performance. The AMD Ryzen 7 4980U chip inside the 15-inch Surface Laptop 4 bested the Surface Laptop 5 with a score of 6748. WTF?

Up until this point I was pretty much onboard with recommending the Surface Laptop 5 but with this revelation I’m suppressing my praise. On the plus side the Surface Laptop 5’s multitasking skills are on point. Flooding Google Chrome with an avalanche of 40 tabs the Microsoft laptop didn’t utter a single moan of oppression. Continuing my typical workload after stressing it out the Surface Laptop 5 handled everything like a champ.

We tasked the Surface Laptop 5 with converting a 4K video to 1080p using the Handbrake transcoding app; it took 8 minutes and 53 seconds to finish. This is better than the average premium laptop (9:58) but worse than the M2 MacBook Air (7:52) and the Acer Swift 5 (7:36). Continuing to disappoint the hell out of me however the Surface Laptop 4 finished the task 32 seconds faster than the Surface Laptop 5. What is going on here?

Microsoft Surface Laptop 5 (Image credit: Future)

Microsoft claims that the Surface Laptop 5 is 50% faster than its predecessor but perhaps it’s only referring to the Intel-based Surface Laptop 4. It’s not talking about the AMD model that’s for sure!

Microsoft Surface Laptop 5 graphics

The Surface Laptop 5 comes with integrated Intel Iris Xe graphics. Consequently this Microsoft laptop is far from being a gaming rig but for grins and giggles we ran the Sid Meier’s Civilization VI: Gathering Storm (1080p) benchmark on it and it notched 33 frames per second. This is worse than the average premium laptop (46 fps).

Microsoft Surface Laptop 5 (Image credit: Future)

As I expected the Surface Laptop 5 also failed to outpace the 10-core GPU inside the M2 chip; the MacBook Air delivered 40 fps. To the Surface Laptop 5’’s delight the Acer Swift 5 packed with Intel Iris Xe graphics couldn’t beat the Microsoft laptop with a measly score of 26 fps. The Surface Laptop 4 beat the Surface Laptop 5 by a hair (35 fps).

Microsoft Surface Laptop 5 battery life

At this point I threw my hands up in the air in exasperation because once again the Surface Laptop 5 failed to best its competitors — and its predecessor too.

Microsoft Surface Laptop 5 (Image credit: Future)

On the Laptop Mag battery life test  which involves the Surface Laptop 5 surfing the web at 150 nits over Wi-Fi until it dies the Microsoft laptop croaked after 9 hours and one minute. This is worse than the average premium laptop which lasts 10 hours and 35 minutes. It also couldn’t compete with the M2 MacBook Air (14:06) and the Acer Swift 5 (11:24).

Even the AMD-based Surface Laptop 4 outlasted the Surface Laptop 5 with a battery runtime of 12 hours and four minutes. Tsk tsk.

Microsoft Surface Laptop 5 webcam

Why is Microsoft still rolling out 720p webcams in this new era of hybrid workplaces where people regularly rely on video conferencing on a daily basis? It can’t even use the ol’ “the bezels are too slim” excuse because as mentioned they’re thicker than a Snicker.

Surface Laptop 5 webcam pic (Image credit: Future)

I can admit that the webcam does a pretty good job at rendering colors. The burgundy curtains in my living room popped while I could make out the subtle blush on my cheeks but it’s neither sharp nor crisp. The black curls on my head appearing quite defined in real life looked like an onyx blob on the camera.

Microsoft Surface Laptop 5 heat

You don’t have to worry about the Surface Laptop 5 burning your thighs off.

When we ran a 15-minute 1080p video on the Surface Laptop 5 the touchpad keyboard center and underside reached temperatures of 85 90 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit which do not surpass our 95-degree comfort threshold. The hottest part of the laptop? A small region on the bottom of the laptop just above the Microsoft label.

Microsoft Surface Laptop software and warranty

The Surface Laptop 5 is so light on bloatware it’s floating up to the clouds. You will find the Disney+ app the Solitaire Collection and Spotify but that’s pretty much it.

Microsoft Surface Laptop 5 review (Image credit: Future)

Powered by Windows 11 Pro you’ll find your standard fare of Microsoft apps like Microsoft News Microsoft Teams Paint People Phone Link and more. Upon setting up the laptop you can launch a 30-day trial of Microsoft 365 apps like Word Excel and PowerPoint but keep in mind that you’ll have to relinquish a credit card for that which leaves you vulnerable to the “Haha! You forgot to cancel so now we’re taking your money!” tactic companies love to use.

The Surface Laptop 5 comes with a one-year warranty. See how Microsoft did on our Tech support showdown and Best and worst brands special reports.

Bottom line

If I can give any advice to Microsoft it would be that it is not in a place where it can continue to roll out these iterative updates. I hate to say it but OEMs like Apple can get away with that because they’ve perfected their craft so their highly praised products just need a few tweaks.

Microsoft on the other hand needs to cut the crap and ditch the thick bezels bury the 720p webcam and squeeze more performance out of its laptops. Finally it goes without saying that your successor should be better than your predecessor but in terms of battery life performance video transcoding display color coverage that is not the case. Perhaps things will change if Microsoft rolls out an AMD variant.

This new Windows 11 ""feature"" was discovered by Windows enthusiast Albacore who shared several screenshots of advertisement notifications in the Accounts flyout.

The screenshots show that Microsoft promotes the OneDrive file hosting service and prods users to create or complete their Microsoft accounts.

Those reacting to this on social media had an adverse reaction to Redmond's decision to display promotional messages in the start menu.

Some said that Windows 11 is ""getting worse in each and every update it gets"" while others added that this is a weird choice given that ""half of the Start Menu is for recommendations"" anyway.

BleepingComputer has also tried replicating this on multiple Windows 11 systems but we didn't get any ads.

This hints at an A/B testing experiment trying to gauge the success of such a ""feature"" on devices running Windows Insider builds or the company pushing such ads to a limited set of customers.

Microsoft sign-out ads (Albacore)

​Ads in the File Explorer the Start Menu and more

Redmond has pushed ads within the user interface of Microsoft Office apps or other Windows apps before.

In August the company displayed ads for Microsoft 365 Family subscriptions to Office 2021 customers with discounts of more than $28 for a 3-month Family plan subscription.

Months earlier in March Windows Insiders started seeing ads for some Microsoft products (including Microsoft Editor) in the File Explorer app.

File Explorer also got injected with promotional messages in 2016 when Redmond used it to show OneDrive ads.

Two years ago the Windows 10 Wordpad application showed ads pushing Microsoft's free Office web apps in its menu bar.

Microsoft was also caught advertising its Microsoft Edge web browser in the Windows 10 Start Menu when users searched for competing browsers.

Unfortunately some of these advertisement tests also had unintended consequences: Microsoft accidentally broke the Windows Start Menu and Taskbar while testing Microsoft Teams ads on Windows Insider builds systems.

A Microsoft spokesperson was not available for comment when contacted by BleepingComputer earlier today.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2h0YXJnZXQuY29tL3NlYXJjaHNlY3VyaXR5L25ld3MvMjUyNTI3MDIwL01pY3Jvc29mdC1OYXRpb24tc3RhdGUtdGhyZWF0cy16ZXJvLWRheS1hdHRhY2tzLWluY3JlYXNpbmfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft: Nation-state threats zero-day attacks increasing,"Nation-state groups are becoming a more dangerous threat as they increasingly target critical infrastructures and rapidly leverage zero-day vulnerabilities according to new Microsoft research.

The tech giant published the Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2022 Friday which highlighted Russia China Iran and North Korea as the primary nation-state threat groups it has observed targeting Microsoft customers over the past year. While the report showed an increase in attacks coinciding with Russia's invasion of Ukraine and NATO allies Microsoft emphasized it saw increased activity from nation-state actors even outside of the conflict.

More significantly Microsoft discovered those actors ""have begun using advancements in automation cloud infrastructure and remote access technologies to attack a wider set of targets."" That includes more sophisticated evasion techniques a shift to targeting the IT services supply chain and improved tactics to leverage zero-day vulnerabilities before they are publicly disclosed and patches are available.

For example in September Microsoft confirmed that two unpatched zero days were being actively exploited again in attacks against its Exchange Server software.

""While zero-day vulnerability attacks tend to initially target a limited set of organizations they are quickly adopted into the larger threat actor ecosystem"" Microsoft wrote in the report. ""This kicks off a race for threat actors to exploit the vulnerability as widely as possible before their potential targets install patches.""

China collecting zero days In an accompanying blog post Tom Burt corporate vice president of customer security and trust at Microsoft attributed many of the recent zero day attacks to China. Burt said such attacks are a direct result of the country's new vulnerability-reporting laws which were enacted by the Chinese government on September 1 2021. The new regulations stated vulnerability information must be submitted to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology within two days of discovery. Additionally the new law prohibited researchers and vendors from disclosing vulnerabilities to ""overseas organizations or individuals other than network product providers."" ""China's collection of these vulnerabilities appears to have increased on the heels of a new law requiring entities in China to report vulnerabilities they discover to the government before sharing them with others"" the blog post read. One noteworthy example of zero-day exploitation prior to public disclosure occurred in 2021 with the discovery of ProxyLogon a group of vulnerabilities that affected Microsoft Exchange Server. Hafnium the Chinese nation-state group launched a series of zero-day attacks before Microsoft publicly disclosed or released patches for the ProxyLogon flaw that posed a risk to organizations for years. Another set of Microsoft Exchange Server flaws were reported to the company in June of 2021 by a security researcher known as ""Orange Tsai"" who also discovered the most serious ProxyLogon bugs. In Tsai's blog post detailing the new attack surface he noted that ""Dlive"" a security researcher from Chinese company Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab independently found and reported the flaws to Microsoft as well. One of the most critical flaws took Microsoft more than one year to publicly disclose and fix and the reason remains unclear. Unfortunately it's not just nation-state groups that are increasingly leveraging zero days. Cyber criminals are too and reported flaws available for exploit are amassing. Microsoft noted that the number of publicly disclosed zero-day vulnerabilities over the past year matches data from 2021 which was the highest on record. Similarly in an April blog post Mandiant Threat Intelligence said it discovered 80 zero-days exploited in the wild in 2021 -- ""more than double the previous record volume in 2019."" Microsoft estimated in its report that on average it only takes 14 days for an exploit to be available in the wild after a vulnerability is publicly disclosed. ""As cyber threat actors -- both nation state and criminal -- become more adept at leveraging these vulnerabilities we have observed a reduction in the time between the announcement of a vulnerability and the commoditization of that vulnerability"" the report read. ""This makes it essential that organizations patch exploits immediately.""

Nation-state groups pose increasing threat To gain a perspective on the potential attack scope Microsoft started sending out nation-state notifications (NSNs) to targeted or compromised customers beginning in 2018. As of June 2022 67000 NSNs have been delivered. Over the past year Microsoft has observed nation-state groups increasingly targeting critical infrastructures with a focus on companies in the IT sector financial services transportation systems and communications infrastructure. Microsoft found that attacks on critical infrastructure compromised 40% of all cyber attacks this year up from 20% the year before. Targets differed by country. Unsurprisingly Microsoft found Russia targeted the Ukrainian government and the country's critical infrastructure to complement its on-the-ground military action which Microsoft referred to as a ""full-scale hybrid conflict."" Iran focused on U.S. critical infrastructure such as port authorities while North Korea continued to steal cryptocurrency from financial and technological companies. In addition to China's extensive zero-day vulnerability usage Microsoft found the nation also expanded its global cyberespionage operations. Additionally Microsoft found a shift from attacking the software supply chain to exploiting the IT services supply chain ""targeting cloud solutions and managed services providers to reach downstream customers."" Cloud adoption and outsourcing to managed service providers has grown in use since the pandemic and a move to remote work which created additional attack vectors to defend. ""We expect actors to continue to exploit trusted relationships in enterprise supply chains emphasizing the importance of comprehensive enforcement of authentication rules diligent patching and account configuration for remote access infrastructure and frequent audits of partner relationships to verify authenticity"" the report read."

The study showed males younger than 40 years old who received the Moderna vaccine were shown to have the highest rates of myocarditis which according to the authors may have implications for choosing specific vaccines for certain populations.

Two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have been approved for use Pfizer BioNTech (BNT162b2) and Moderna Spikevax (mRNA-1273) and as of March 20 2022 more than 52 million doses of Pfizer and 22 million doses of Moderna have been administered in Canada where this study was conducted. Clinical trials have demonstrated the vaccines are safe and monitoring of vaccinated people has shown side effects are mild and go away on their own. However some rare but serious side effects have been observed after both vaccines mainly myocarditis (inflammation of the heart).

While there have been many studies on either vaccine few studies have been conducted to directly compare the safety of the two mRNA vaccines. Researchers in this study sought to compare the risk of myocarditis pericarditis and myopericarditis between the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines.

People in the study were 18 years old or older and had received two primary doses of either Pfizer or Moderna vaccine in British Columbia Canada with the second dose between Jan. 1 2021 and Sept. 9 2021. Individuals whose first or second shot were administered outside of British Columbia or had a history of myocarditis or pericarditis within one year prior to second dose were excluded.

In all more than 2.2 million second Pfizer doses were given and more than 870000 Moderna doses. Within 21 days of the second dose there were a total of 59 myocarditis cases (21 Pfizer and 31 Moderna) and 41 pericarditis cases (21 Pfizer and 20 Moderna). Researchers also looked at rates per million doses and the rate was 35.6 cases per million for Moderna and 12.6 per million for Pfizer-;an almost threefold increase after Moderna shots vs. Pfizer. Comparatively rates of myocarditis in the general population in 2018 were 2.01 per million in people under age 40 and 2.2 per million in people over age 40.

Rates of myocarditis and pericarditis were higher with the Moderna vaccine in both males and females between ages 18 and 39 with the highest per million rates in males ages 18-29 after a second dose of Moderna.

According to the authors the findings support recommending certain populations receive certain vaccines to maximize benefits and minimize adverse events.

Few population-based analyses have been conducted to directly compare the safety of the two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines which differ in important ways that could impact safety. Our findings have implications for strategizing the rollout of mRNA vaccines which should also consider the self-limiting and mild nature of most myocarditis events benefits provided by vaccination higher effectiveness of the Moderna vaccine against infection and hospitalization [found in prior studies] and the apparent higher risk of myocarditis following COVID-19 infection than with mRNA vaccination."" Naveed Janjua MBBS DrPH lead author of the study and epidemiologist and the executive director of Data and Analytic Services at the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control

Limitations of the study include that it was observational which limits the ability to determine causality between vaccination and myocarditis or pericarditis. However temporality was ensured in the study design to limit the time studied between vaccine dose and myocarditis/pericarditis diagnosis. Also the study relied on hospital and emergency department visit data and may have missed some less severe cases.

In a related editorial comment Guy Witberg MD MPH a cardiologist at Rabin Medical Center in Petah-Tikva Israel wrote the study is reassuring for vaccine safety since it provides further data that myocarditis is a very rare adverse event after both vaccines and it is an important step toward a personalized approach to administering COVID-19 vaccines.

""[The study] should help put to rest 'vaccine hesitancy' due to concerns over cardiac adverse events"" Witberg said. ""This is one of only a few direct comparisons of the two widely adopted mRNA vaccines and its results have practical policy implications: for a substantial segment of the population suffering from cardiovascular disease…these data give a strong argument to preferentially use the BNT162b2 [Pfizer] vaccine over mRNA-1273 [Moderna].""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzL2hlYWx0aC8yMDIyLzExLzA3L2ZsdS1jb3ZpZC12YWNjaW5lLXBmaXplci1tb2Rlcm5hLzgyNTc0NDQwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Flu COVID vaccine: Pfizer Moderna working on combination shot,"Human trials are underway to assess the safety and efficacy of a flu-COVID combination vaccine.

Moderna has finished enrolling trial participants while Pfizer-BioNTech isn't too far behind.

Health experts say these combination vaccines could be available as early as next flu season.

As the holiday season draws near more Americans may be sporting two Band-Aids after receiving both their flu shot and the new COVID-19 bivalent booster.

Vaccine developers are looking to relieve people from the unpleasantness of getting two shots by creating one that offers strong protection against both viruses.

Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech companies that have led the COVID-19 vaccination strategy say they're beginning trials to assess the safety efficacy and dosage of their candidate vaccine that combines four flu strains and two coronavirus strains.

Health experts say these combination vaccines could be available as early as next flu season. Here's what to know.

What's the difference between flu and COVID-19?

Influenza: An infection of the respiratory system including the nose throat and lungs.

Flu symptoms: Fever chills muscle aches cough congestion runny nose headache and fatigue.

Flu strains: There are four types of influenza viruses – A B C and D – but the strains that typically cause seasonal flu illness are influenza A and B. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says influenza C primarily causes mild disease and influenza D is normally seen in cattle not people.

Depending on the flu season in the U.S the CDC estimates the virus causes:

9 million to 40 million cases.

140000 to 710000 hospitalizations.

12000 to 5200 deaths.

COVID-19: First discovered in December 2019 and caused by SARS-CoV-2.

COVID-19 symptoms: Fever or chills cough shortness of breath fatigue muscle or body aches and new loss of taste or smell.

The coronavirus may also cause respiratory symptoms similar to the flu but research has shown other parts of the body may also be affected by the disease. In some people it can also cause ""long COVID"" or life-altering symptoms that endure for months or even years after an initial infection.

COVID-19 strains: Dozens of coronavirus strains have popped up all over the world. But a few came out on top over the course of the pandemic most prominently the delta and omicron variants.

The BA.5 subvariant of omicron made up more than 99% of new cases in August but now makes up only about 40%. Coronavirus variants that are gaining momentum include BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 which are also subvariants of omicron.

The U.S. has reported more than 97.6 million cases and 1.07 million deaths from COVID-19 according to Johns Hopkins University data.

What flu and COVID vaccines do we currently use?

Influenza: The type of flu shot a person gets is based on their age but each kind is designed to protect against four flu strains circulating that season. Most standard dose flu vaccines are approved for people 6 months and older and they are made using virus grown in eggs.

Other shots include:

Cell-based: Contains virus grown in cells approved for people 6 months and older.

Contains virus grown in cells approved for people 6 months and older. Recombinant: Made using recombinant technology without flu viruses approved for people 18 years and older.

Made using recombinant technology without flu viruses approved for people 18 years and older. Attenuated: Egg-based shot that contains a weakened live virus approved for ages 2 to 49.

Egg-based shot that contains a weakened live virus approved for ages 2 to 49. High-dose or adjuvanted: Egg-based shot with a high-dose or a special ingredient that helps create a stronger immune response approved for people 65 and older.

COVID-19: The most widely used shots in the United States are messenger RNA vaccines created by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.

In a COVID-19 vaccine mRNA spurs cells to make a spike protein normally found on the surface of the coronavirus. That way when the immune system sees the actual virus it will recognize the protein and attack the virus before it can do serious damage.

Both companies offer a primary series vaccine that contains only the original coronavirus and a bivalent booster that is also meant to generate spike proteins from the BA.4 and BA.5 omicron subvariants.

COVID BIVALENT BOOSTERS:Which one should I get and when?

LATEST NEWS:Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent booster is as safe as earlier shots

What would the new vaccines do?

Ideally: They would protect against COVID-19 and the flu with a single shot. There are no approved flu vaccines with mRNA technology but companies are looking to change that.

An mRNA-based flu vaccine would be less costly to manufacture and may produce a better immune response in the elderly said Dr. Daniel Kuritzkes division chief of infectious diseases at Brigham and Women's Hospital.

Vaccine developers are using their candidate flu vaccines that use mRNA technology and combining it with their bivalent booster. The combination vaccines induce an immune response specific to the four strains of flu circulating that season the original coronavirus and the BA.4/BA.5 subvariants.

""What it should do it generate high-titer neutralizing antibody against influenza (and COVID) and it should also be safe"" Kuritzkes said. ""We don’t want people getting much worse reactions in terms of fever chills and muscle aches as a consequence of getting a combination vaccine.""

Moderna Pfizer: What's in the works

Pfizer-BioNTech: The companies have announced the start of Phase 1 trials to evaluate the safety efficacy and optimal dose level of its combination candidate vaccine. The trial includes 180 participants ages 18 to 64 with the first person receiving a dose the beginning of November. Researchers will follow up with participants after six months the companies said in a statement.

The combination vaccine includes authorized bivalent vaccine and a new mRNA-based flu vaccine candidate which is now in Phase 3 trials.

Moderna: The Cambridge-based company is slightly ahead of the curve. It already has its Phase 1/2 trial fully enrolled with participants ages 18 to 75.

The flu-COVID candidate vaccine combines Moderna’s original COVID-19 mRNA vaccine with its candidate mRNA flu vaccine which is also in Phase 3 trials.

Can you get flu and COVID-19 at the same time? Would a new vaccine help?

Experts: Co-infections with respiratory viruses happen ""all the time"" especially in early childhood said Dr. Pedro Piedra professor of molecular virology and microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine.

It’s possible to co-detect the flu and COVID-19 in the same person – what was dubbed “flurona” last year – but health experts say it’s difficult to determine which virus is causing the principal infection and related symptoms.

There has yet to be data in human participants but health experts say in theory a combination vaccine should protect against both a flu and coronavirus infection.

""Having combination vaccines for respiratory pathogens that circulate during the fall and winter months is an ideal type of vaccine ... as long as (they're) safe well tolerated and effective"" Piedra said.

Combining vaccines is nothing new he said. Although none exist for respiratory viruses many common childhood vaccines protect against multiple diseases and contain multiple vaccines.

Where can I get a flu and COVID-19 vaccine now?

Health officials say Americans can get their flu and COVID-19 shots in the same visit.

Doctor's office: Experts advise to call ahead before making an appointment to make sure the vaccine you want or need is available.

Pharmacy: Major pharmacy retailers such as Walgreens and CVS offer both vaccines and accept walk-ins or appointments online.

Vaccines.gov: Americans unsure of where to find the closest available vaccine can visit this website and choose a vaccine based on age and manufacturer.

Details of the settlement have not been disclosed but notably it comes midway through a case that many in the re/insurance industry had hoped would set a legal precedent around issues of acts of war in cyber coverage.

Zurich had denied claims from Mondelez on the grounds that the NotPetya attack which initially targeted Ukrainian organizations had been a state-sponsored attack by Russia and therefore fell under its act of war exemptions.

Firms such as Mondelez were considered to have taken collateral damage as the malware spread beyond its initial targets with Mondelez claiming to have incurred $100 million of damages after having 24000 laptops and 1700 servers wiped out on its network.

Believing this represented clear physical loss or damage under its cyber insurance policy Mondelez therefore brought a lawsuit against Zurich to contest the interpretation of its war exemptions.

Insurers have since been looking to this case for a clear verdict on how policy wordings and exclusions on this nascent class of business would hold up under intense legal scrutiny.

This early settlement by Zurich is thus an unsatisfactory conclusion for many although it does indicate that Zurich perhaps saw that the court was beginning to weigh in favor of Mondelez and sought to wrap things up while there was still room to negotiate terms.

The insurer has held discussions with Chicago officials about the potential move but it has yet to announce a decision according to people familiar with the matter. Discussions are ongoing and Allstate which employs more than 7000 people in Illinois could still choose a different location for the headquarters. It’s unclear how many people would be affected since 75% of the company’s employees work from home.

Moving back to the city would help Chicago make up for some high-profile corporate departures this year including the decision by Citadel Ken Griffin’s giant hedge fund to leave for Miami. It also would dovetail with a trend of companies decamping from the Illinois suburbs to the city in search of young university talent. McDonald’s Corp. and Oreo-cookie maker Mondelez International Inc. are among companies that relocated from the suburbs to the trendy Fulton market district in recent years.

A spokesman for Allstate said the insurer is “considering options for a modern headquarters in Illinois that will support the way our employees are working now and into the future.” The city of Chicago didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Allstate bought a building in Chicago’s central business district earlier this year. While 29 North Wacker Drive will house some employees it’s unlikely to become Allstate’s headquarters according to the people who asked not to be identified because the talks with the city are private.

In an interview Chief Executive Officer Tom Wilson said the company was re-evaluating what it would want from a new headquarters and that an ideal campus would foster collaboration and mentorship rather than languishing as an empty office full of computer monitors.

Allstate sold the majority of its Northbrook campus for $232 million this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmp1c3QtZm9vZC5jb20vbmV3cy9jYW5hZGFzLW1hcGxlLWxlYWYtZm9vZHMtaGl0LWJ5LWN5YmVyYXR0YWNrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Canada's Maple Leaf Foods hit by cyberattack,"Canada’s Maple Leaf Foods the meat and plant-based alternatives business said on Sunday (6 November) it was the subject of a cyberattack.

Meanwhile Sobeys the Canadian grocery chain owned by the Empire Company conglomerate today confirmed media reports it has been “impacted by an IT systems issue”.

Maple Leaf said in a statement yesterday “it is currently experiencing a system outage linked to a cybersecurity incident”.

The publicly-listed group added: “The company is executing its business continuity plans as it works to restore the impacted systems; however it expects that full resolution of the outage will take time and result in some operational and service disruptions.”

Just Food contacted Maple Leaf today to confirm the current status of its food-supply operations and the potential financial impact on the multi-billion-dollar business.

“An investigation is ongoing to understand how this happened” the company responded. “The outage is creating some operational and service disruptions that vary by business unit plant and site.

“We do expect some disruption in our operations and service levels as we work through the restoration process but our team is deploying our business continuity plan and implementing workarounds to mitigate the impact on our operations and business.”

In its statement Sobeys which also sits beside Safeway Thrifty Foods FreshCo and Foodland under the business umbrella said it is “making significant progress in reducing the impact of this disruption”.

Cybersecurity threats have been a concern in the food manufacturing industry for some time with implications for possible disruptions to supply and potential contamination of food products by attackers. JBS the global meat supplier based in Brazil paid US$11m last year to Russian hackers to avoid such a scenario.

Apetito the frozen-food supplier in Germany was also hit in June this year. And KP Snacks the UK business owned by Germany’s Intersnack Group was the subject of a ransomware attack back in February. There have also been similar incidents across food and beverage in recent years with companies including US brewer Molson Coors Beverage Co. Mondelez International and fast-food chain Wendy’s affected.

Research and analytics firm GlobalData pointed to incidents in 2017 at Reckitt Benckiser and Mondelez when both consumer-goods companies were infected with the NotPetya virus. The attack cost Reckitt $129m and Mondelez $188m Just Food’s parent company noted in a report published in June.

GlobalData forecasts cybersecurity revenues generated in the consumer-goods sector will reach $6.5bn by 2025 growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.6% from $3.9bn in 2020. Those revenues cover hardware software and services taking in areas such as firewalls and VPN appliances data protection and emergency incidence response.

Maple Leaf said in its statement yesterday: “Upon learning of the incident Maple Leaf Foods took immediate action and engaged cybersecurity and recovery experts. Its team of information systems professionals and third-party experts are working diligently with all available resources to investigate the outage and resolve the situation.”

In August Maple Leaf reported a CAD40.9m (US$30.3m) loss for the six months to 30 June compared to a CAD56.5m profit a year earlier.

The second-quarter loss was CAD54.6m versus an CAD8.8m profit in the corresponding period. “The net loss resulted from weaker commercial performance due to cost inflation and labour challenges as well as higher restructuring costs and start-up expenses” Maple Leaf said.

Maple Leaf launched a review of its plant-based meat operations late last year following a run of disappointing sales. Early in 2022 the company said it was adjusting assumptions for the sector housing the Lightlife and Field Roast brands after concluding “the category will continue to grow at more modest but still attractive rates”.

Plant-based sales dropped 5.5% to CAD85.7m in the first six months of the current financial year compared to revenue for the group as a whole of CAD2.32bn. Meat sales were up 5.6% at CAD2.25bn.

Sales of the company's energy brands were up 11.2% in the 13-week period through Oct. 22 2022 according to Nielsen data for all outlets combined (i.e. convenience grocery drug mass merchandisers).

By individual brand within Monster's portfolio sales of Reign increased 11.8% sales of Monster increased by 11.4% over the same period NOS was up 13% and Full Throttle increased by 7.1% for the 4-week period through October 2022.

By comparison sales of competitor Red Bull were up 6.2% Rockstar was up 8.1% and 5-Hour Energy dropped 2.2%. Sales of Bang Energy registered the steepest declines dropping 27.3% for the 4 weeks ended Oct. 22 2022 compared to the same period last year.

In terms of actual market share Monster's share of the category increased from 30.8% one year ago to 31.1% presently. Competitors Red Bull Rockstar Energy and Bang Energy saw market share declines with Bang declining by 2.5% to command 4.8% of the total energy drink market according to Nielsen data for the four weeks ended Oct. 22 2022.

""The company has regained market share leadership in the energy drink category in the United States""​ said CEO Rodney Sacks on the company's Q3 2022 earnings call.

Monster Energy vs. Bang Energy Earlier this year Monster Energy won its case against Bang Energy's parent company Vital Pharmaceuticals (VPX) which ordered VPX to pay $175m and $9.3m in attorney's fees and costs as well as an ongoing 5% royalty on all future sales of VPX Bang's energy drinks and other Bang-branded products. In September 2022 a California court awarded Monster Energy an additional $293m in damages on its claims against VPX for false advertising misappropriation of trade secrets and interference with Monster's contracts over shelf space with certain key retailers. Sacks would not comment on Bang Energy's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filed in October 2022.

Further pricing actions likely

In order to mitigate inflationary pressures Sacks said the company will continue to review pricing actions which included a recent 6% market-wide price increase in the US which went into effect on Sept. 1 2022.

""During the 2022 third quarter the company experienced a significant increase in cost of sales relative to the comparative 2021 third quarter primarily due to increased ingredient and other input costs including secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees increased logistical costs increased aluminum can costs and geographical and product sales mix​"" said Sacks.

However the company has stabilized its supply chain and turned to local sourcing of its aluminum cans which will help drive down its operations cost in the long term noted Sacks.

""We continue to believe that some of these increased costs we are experiencing are likely to be transitory. ​ We have decreased our reliance on imported cans and are currently purchasing aluminum cans from local sources globally. We have seen a reduction in cost of sales through increased use of domestic cans as we continue to cycle through existing inventories of imported cans over the next few quarters""​ he added.

2023 innovation

New product innovation in the form of its highly teased alcohol launch Beast Unleashed and a new zero-sugar product Monster Energy Zero Sugar are planned for January 2023 and will help drive new consumer usage occasions claimed Sacks.

""Monster Energy's Zero Sugar was specifically developed as an indistinguishable zero sugar analog of our original unique Monster Energy Green flavor. We are excited about the opportunities that this product will provide to our Monster consumers who have come to enjoy the unique taste profile of our original Monster Green flavor which remains our leading flavor""​ he said.

Sacks added ""Our alcohol innovation pipeline is robust. In addition to The Beast Unleashed we will relaunch Wild Basin Hard Seltzer with new packaging and great new flavors and taste profiles. The Dale's beer family will get a refresh including the introduction of Dale's American Light Lager an easy-drinking lager with 4.2% alcohol by volume 95 calories and 2.5 carbs per 12-ounce serving. We also have several additional innovative alcohol beverage products under development and look forward to sharing use of those products at a later date.""​",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmp1c3QtZHJpbmtzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2JhbmctZW5lcmd5LXRvLXB1bGwtc3VwZXItY3JlYXRpbmUtbWVzc2FnaW5nLWFtaWQtbW9uc3Rlci1saXRpZ2F0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bang Energy to remove “super creatine” claim from drinks,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmp1c3QtZHJpbmtzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2JhbmctZW5lcmd5LXRvLXB1bGwtc3VwZXItY3JlYXRpbmUtbWVzc2FnaW5nLWFtaWQtbW9uc3Rlci1saXRpZ2F0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF3222D70>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmp1c3QtZHJpbmtzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2JhbmctZW5lcmd5LXRvLXB1bGwtc3VwZXItY3JlYXRpbmUtbWVzc2FnaW5nLWFtaWQtbW9uc3Rlci1saXRpZ2F0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV2ZXJ5ZGF5aGVhbHRoLmNvbS9kaWV0LW51dHJpdGlvbi9kby1lbmVyZ3ktZHJpbmtzLWNvdW50LWFzLWZsdWlkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Do Energy Drinks Count as Fluid?,"Water vs. Energy Drinks: How Do They Compare?

Without a doubt water is healthier and more hydrating than energy drinks. Because energy drinks tend to be so high in sugar and caffeine they contain a smaller amount of water 89 percent by weight per the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). While you’ll still be gaining hydration from the water these beverages do contain you’ll also be getting loads of added sugars and high amounts of caffeine. Additionally drinking water poses no health risks whatsoever while energy drinks have a laundry list of potential side effects (more on that below).

Nutrition Facts of Energy Drinks

A wide variety of beverages fall under the energy-drink category and their nutrition facts also vary widely. The NCCIH points out that a 16 oz energy drink may contain up to 240 milligrams (mg) of caffeine while a tiny 2 to 2.5 oz energy shot can pack nearly as much with up to 200 mg. The USDA’s listing for a standard energy drink meanwhile states that one 12 oz can contains 160 calories 38 grams (g) of added sugar and 108 mg of caffeine. That is about the same amount of sugar in a can of cola and a comparable amount of caffeine to what you’ll get from a cup of coffee. The Mayo Clinic notes that while caffeine is a mild diuretic (aka it will make you urinate more) caffeinated beverages will not contribute to dehydration mainly because energy drinks are mostly water by weight — about 89 percent according to data from the USDA.

Many brands do offer sugar-free varieties as a lower-calorie option. If you opt for a sugar-free energy drink you’ll save on calories and sugar. According to the USDA a 12 oz serving of a sugar-free energy drink contains about 14 calories and (it goes without saying) zero sugar. You’ll also get a similar amount of caffeine at 115 mg. Keep in mind that these sugar-free beverages will likely contain artificial sweeteners.

Energy Drinks vs. Sports Drinks: Which Is More Hydrating?

Energy drinks and sports drinks both contain sugar as the second ingredient (after water) according to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Sports drinks however offer better hydration than energy drinks — perhaps unsurprising since they are designed to do just that. Sports drinks tend to have less sugar than energy drinks and generally do not contain caffeine according to Harvard. This means you’ll get less water per cup in energy drinks than in sports drinks.

Types of Energy Drinks and How Hydrating They Are

Traditional energy drinks (8 to 12 oz) At 89 percent water traditional energy drinks will offer some hydration. The sugar caffeine and potential negative health effects (such as heart complications insomnia and anxiety according to the CDC) make it a less-than-ideal way to hydrate.

Energy shots (2 to 2.5 oz) You’ll likely find these tiny bottles near the register at your favorite store. It’s tough to imagine but one tiny bottle of a leading brand contains 200 mg of caffeine (an amount equivalent to about 16 oz of brewed coffee). While that amount fits comfortably into the Mayo Clinic’s recommendation of 400 mg of caffeine or less per day it can be easy to overdo it if you’re also getting other sources of caffeine throughout the day or if you have more than one energy shot. Additionally because of their small size and large amount of caffeine they contribute very little in the way of hydration.

Sugar-free energy drinks At 99 percent water by weight these are your best hydration options if you’re reaching for an energy drink and looking to reap hydrating benefits. But be aware that they often contain artificial sweeteners.

Health Benefits of Energy Drinks Beyond Hydration

In addition to offering some hydration some studies have suggested that energy drinks may improve physical stamina although a review article in the International Journal of Health Sciences noted that research to support these claims is limited. That being said the amount of sugar they contain more than negates any benefits. Additionally the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health points to the fact that regular consumption of energy drinks has been linked to a number of negative health effects including mental health kidney and dental problems. Excessive intake in youth can even lead to risk-taking behaviors. Heavy energy drink consumption has even been linked to heart failure according to an article published in the British Medical Journal in April 2021. All these risks have called the safety of energy drinks into question. If you must drink energy drinks it’s best to enjoy them in moderation.

Should You Try Energy Drinks to Stay Hydrated?

While energy drinks can be counted toward your hydration needs they shouldn’t be a first line of defense to stave off dehydration. Energy drinks are high in sugar and caffeine and having them on a regular basis has been linked to negative health outcomes. If you choose to include them as part of your hydration routine they should be a small part of the plan in combination with calorie-free options such as water and seltzer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZXZuZXQuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMi9tYXJrZXRpbmctbW9uc3Rlci1lbmVyZ3ktaW5rcy1kZWFsLXdpdGgtbmV3LXlvcmstcmFuZ2Vycy1sZWlzdXJldG93bi1wYXJ0bmVycy13aXRoLWNvbWVkaWFuLWNoZWxzZWEtaGFuZGxlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marketing: Monster Energy Inks Deal With New York Rangers; Leisuretown Partners With Comedian Chelsea Handler,"Monster Energy Inks Deal With New York Rangers

California-based energy drink giant Monster has inked a marketing deal with the New York Rangers and Madison Square Garden the brand announced in a press release.

As part of the integrated marketing partnership the indoor arena will feature a co-branded grab-and-go concession stand dubbed the “Monster Energy Bodega.” According to the release the stand will help independently owned stores with Monster Energy products by providing financial assistance to bodegas throughout the tri-state area recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We are consistently thinking of new innovative ways to bring the best food and beverage options to our fans and are thrilled to be able to offer Monster Energy drinks at the garden” said Madison Square Garden EVP chief sales and marketing officer Ron Skotarczak in the release. “We’re looking forward to unleashing the power of this partnership and working with Monster Energy to support local tri-state area bodegas.”

In addition to the concession stand the partnership will also provide Monster with branding exposure throughout the arena including a dasher board during Rangers games and LED ribbon signage during all events.

The energy drink giant’s announcement comes on the heels of numerous other marketing partnerships over the past year. Last month the brand teamed up with EA and Respawn Entertainment to launch three new limited-edition Apex cans in Monster Original Green Monster Lo-Carb and Monster Zero Ultra. In June the brand launched its all-access pass promotion giving fans a chance to win a trip and all-inclusive backstage pass to either a UFC MotoGP or Supercross event.

“We’re thrilled to finally announce the partnership between Monster Energy Madison Square Garden and the New York Rangers” said Monster Energy CMO Dan McHugh in the release. “We have been working on this one for quite a while so to see it finally materialize is a huge victory for both of us.”

Last week Monster reported 15.2% year-over-year growth in Q3 2022 even as increased expenses and cost of goods continue to drag down the brand’s margins despite price increases.

Leisuretown Partners With Comedian Chelsea Handler

Leisuretown has announced a strategic partnership with comedian Chelsea Handler. Through the partnership she will develop and introduce new offerings within the brand’s CBD-and-THC-infused seltzer portfolio.

“I am always looking for ways to minimize my alcohol consumption with healthier options and Leisuretown offers a delicious low caloric low sugar option” said Handler in a press release. “I am looking to operate at my highest level and I have finally found a brand that I believe can take my wellness to the next level.”

Launched earlier this year in California Leisuretown produces a lineup of better-for-you cannabis-infused sparkling waters. Available in three flavors – Cherry Vanilla Ginger Berry and Yuzu Lime – each can contains 2.5mg of THC and 5mg of CBD. The brand teamed up with professional DJ Diplo and TV personality Rob Dyrdek for the launch of its beverages.

According to data released by Future Market Insights (FMI) the global cannabis drinks market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 37.3% and top a variation of $8.3 billion by 2032.

“Non-alcoholic drinks are on the rise and the cannabis drinks category is growing” said Leisuretown CEO Andrew Hagstrom in the release. “Our products allow consumers an alternative format to partake in THC without smoking or vaping.”

BioSteel Expands Its Roster of Athletes With Four Elite Hockey Players

Sports nutrition brand BioSteel has expanded its growing roster of athletes with four elite women’s hockey players: Laila Edwards Sarah Fillier Calla Frank and Jade Iginla.

“Staying hydrated keeps me healthy and performing at my best and BioSteel products are an essential part of my routine” said freshman forward and gold medalist Iginla in a press release. “As I work on bringing my game to the next level I’m excited to have the support of the brand’s zero sugar sports drinks.”

Founded in 2009 BioSteel is a division of Canadian cannabis conglomerate Canopy Growth Company itself backed by liquor and spirits company Constellation Brands. Within the past year the sports nutrition brand has emerged as a new player in the ever-evolving RTD sports drink category. It currently markets a line of zero sugar electrolyte hydration products in five flavors: Blue Raspberry Mixed Berry Peach Mango Rainbow Twist and White Freeze.

In January BioSteel announced a U.S. distribution expansion through which the brand will enter nearly 15000 new doors nationwide across grocery convenience and drug store chains. The new retailers include Albertsons Company Food Lion Giant Food Publix Stop & Shop Rite Aid and Sheetz.

The four elite women’s hockey players join BioSteel’s existing roster of athletes including international soccer star Alphonso Davies rising hockey star Connor Bedard and Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Alex Manoah.

“We’re thrilled to welcome Laila Sarah Calla and Jade to our team of elite athletes” said BioSteel co-founder Michael Cammalleri in the release. “These athletes represent the next generation and we look forward to supporting them on and off the ice with our lineup of zero sugar hydration products as they take their games to the next level and inspire their communities.”

Caffeine is one of the most common stimulants in the world according to the Mayo Clinic with approximately 90% of adults consuming it daily. Energy drinks are a particularly popular source of caffeine with global sales reaching close to $60 billion in 2020. The caffeine content of these drinks can range anywhere from 80 milligrams in an eight-ounce can of Red Bull to a whopping 200 milligrams in one 2-ounce Five-Hour Energy shot (via Healthline).

In addition to the high caffeine content energy drinks tend to be made up of sugar B vitamins and amino acids like taurine and L-carnitine. This combination of ingredients is designed to boost your mental performance and energy level. A 2004 study published in Psychopharmacology showed improved attention and memory in energy drink users.

Given the high caffeine content of energy drinks it can be tempting to consider swapping out your morning cup of coffee for a can of Red Bull. But flooding your system with just an energy drink may not be the wisest option — especially if you're skipping breakfast."

QatarEnergy's 'Aa3' long-term issuer rating reflects the combination of hydrocarbon major’s Baseline Credit Assessment (BCA) a measure of its standalone credit profile of 'aa3'; the government's 'Aa3' sovereign rating with a ""positive"" outlook; very high dependence on; and very high support from the Qatari government.

QatarEnergy's BCA is supported by the significant scale of Qatar's proved gas reserves; its strong LNG (liquefied natural gas) franchise which had a global market share of more than 20% (for Qatar's LNG exports) in 2021; the low-cost nature of its operations as well as strong operating efficiency; and very strong financial and liquidity profiles with a track record of maintaining strong metrics over time.

IQ's 'A1' long-term issuer rating reflects its BCA of 'baa1' and a three-notch uplift based on the assumption of very high dependence on and high support from the government.

The BCA is underpinned by IQ's strong competitive position as a low-cost producer; a very strong financial profile with debt-to-Ebitda (earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortisation) below 1.0x through the cycle; and a high degree of integration and coordination between IQ and QatarEnergy notably through board representation shared management and QatarEnergy's control over key IQ group financial policies as well as financial and investment decisions at the operating company level.

Long-term feedstock agreements with QatarEnergy which give IQ a high degree of resilience to various down cycles in the sector in which it operates substantially mitigate IQ's exposure to hydrocarbon price risk.

Moody's said Kahramaa's 'A1' long-term issuer rating reflects the standalone creditworthiness as expressed by a BCA of 'baa1' and a very high level of dependence and sovereign support.

Kahramaa's standalone assessment is supported by a low risk profile of its power and water transmission and distribution activities; its monopoly position in Qatar; a system of government subsidies based on the recovery of costs and a fair profit margin; and a conservative financial profile characterised by low leverage.",,,,,,,,,,,,

“That was an eye opener for us” said Alice Milligan Morgan Stanley’s CMO. “With Morgan Stanley Equities Research predicting that the global space industry will surge to more than$1 trillion by the year 2040 we believe we have an opportunity to help break down barriers and provide everyone with an equitable opportunity to participate in the growing space economy.”

To that end the financial services company decided to collaborate with Courageous the brand studio of CNN to bring awareness to the issue of inclusive spacesuit design by unveiling a conceptual model spacesuit in Times Square in October.

The immersive activation called “Creating Space” allowed visitors to explore the history of spacesuit design with displays showcasing historic replica suits plus pose for photos as astronauts via augmented-reality (AR) technology. As an engagement-encouraging add-on photos that were shared to social media were beamed to the signage outside Morgan Stanley’s Times Square headquarters.

Visitors could also walk through a “galaxy room” with mirrored walls floors and a ceiling that projected images from the James Webb Space Telescope. And on the way out the new Morgan Stanley Access I spacesuit was on display; it was conceptualized with a team of space experts including Vinita Marwaha Madill founder of Rocket Women which highlights women in STEM industries along with historians and engineers.

On the International Space Station (ISS) suits known as HUT units are currently only available in medium large and extra-large which is why the first all-female spacewalk was canceled (there weren’t enough medium-sized units ready). To increase inclusivity Morgan Stanley’s speculative suit concept includes air bladders in the chest cavity that can be inflated or deflated to accommodate different torso shapes and sizes as well as improved joint components for better mobility.

The “Creating Space” activation was “part of a larger partnership with CNN to bring attention to the need for more inclusive spacesuit design and help remove barriers for women in space” Milligan said. The one-day activation welcomed about 3000 visitors; folks can still learn more on CNN.com.

The spacesuit project is also the latest effort within Morgan Stanley’s larger marketing strategy. “As a firm we’re very committed to championing diversity and inclusion and you’ll see that increasingly reflected in the way we go to market as a brand” Milligan said.

The company has collaborated with fashion designer Rebecca Minkoff to redesign the traditional banker bag—which has typically been carried by men on Wall Street—for a broader audience. The bag was launched in Sept. during the most recent New York Fashion Week. And brand ambassador Leylah Fernandez a 20-year-old Canadian tennis pro and citizen of Ecuadorian and Filipino descent appeared in a new ad spot for Morgan Stanley that launched during the U.S. Open. “The response we had on both initiatives was tremendous with social and earned media metrics far surpassing benchmarks” Milligan said.

Citing the recent Edelman Trust Barometer (a score that measures the average percent of trust in institutions like NGOs business government and media) Milligan pointed to the reported 58% of respondents said that they will buy or advocate for brands based on their beliefs and values. She added that “increasingly there is an expectation that brands do well by doing good; that they stand up and champion initiatives that put purpose front and center and build more equitable representative and inclusive cultures.”

Read last week’s article here.

“The aspect of M-A I remember the most is the people. It was so fun getting to know everyone! There are so many amazing teachers who are really passionate about broadening their students’ horizons” said Elley Goldberg a recent graduate from MIT with a degree in Mathematics who now works as a derivatives trader at Morgan Stanley.

At M-A Goldberg was a journalist on the MArk magazine staff who especially enjoyed her English and history classes. “I was kind of on the history train throughout high school” she said “but when I started taking higher level math courses in college I found them super interesting and fun. I especially enjoyed a class called Numerical Analysis which involved a lot of approximation algorithms and Computational Linear Algebra. I only took one or two math classes per semester so I was also able to explore other interests. My Pre-Modern China and Modern African History classes at MIT were very cool.”

Working at Morgan Stanley Goldberg explained bridges her interests in history and math. “I like knowing what’s going on in the world and the context of why things are the way they are. Financial markets are impacted a lot by current events so you have to stay up to date on macroeconomics.” In finance a derivative is a contract whose value is dependent on an underlying asset. Commonly used assets include stocks bonds and currencies. Traders like Goldberg use derivatives to speculate how the values of these assets will change over time.

In her free time Goldberg enjoys going to workout classes with her friends. She said “the whole reformer pilates movement is slightly gimmicky but it’s also fun!” At MIT Goldberg was involved in a club that did dance classes and math tutoring for middle school girls in Boston. She explained “We would do an hour of dance and an hour of one-on-one tutoring and mentorship with the girls. I always had so much fun with them!”

Goldberg’s advice to current M-A students: “For people going into college I feel like there’s a lot of debate over whether you should do the fun humanities stuff that you enjoy or if you should be going to college to learn hard specific skills and prepare yourself for a career. I was really thinking about that my senior year of high school but looking back I think I was unnecessarily worried. You can do both at really any university. You aren’t going to be forced to choose between STEM and the humanities or specialize in one specific thing if you don’t want to. If you go in the liberal arts direction definitely take a few technical classes like data science statistics or introductory coding. It doesn’t take a lot of time to become somewhat proficient and those skills are important. Also stay open-minded about your future and just see what opportunities come your way. Don’t be afraid to change your mind or switch paths.”

On her favorite books Goldberg said “I recently read Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain about the inner workings of the restaurant industry which was very interesting. I also really enjoyed Invisible Man—which I never would’ve made it through on my own—but we read it in one of my M-A English classes and it was great.”

Disclaimer: Bears Doing Big Things is not meant to be a list ranking the most accomplished or famous M-A graduates on Earth. It is a collection of people with a wide range of expertise opinions and stages of life who were kindly willing to share their stories. All have wisdom entertaining anecdotes and book recommendations to share. There are 45000+ additional accomplished M-A alums out there so keep an eye out for them!"

“People in Tallachatchee County are to a great degree tired of Emmett Till… Somebody came down here and got into trouble. Overstepped his bounds to a degree some folks thought. And they cured him of his problems. Every day somebody’s dragging up the race card. Somebody’s saying we have racial disparity here. If nobody would stir the damn pile of stuff up it wouldn’t stink.” — John Whitten former county prosecutor

“Just like Mississippi there’s the white side of the story and there’s the Black side. And they don’t necessarily agree.” — Mississippi Congressman Benny Thompson (Chairman of the United States House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol)

(Source: All Things Considered ‘Why Don’t Y’all Let That Die?’ Telling the Emmett Till Story in Mississippi)

In the Ballad of Emmett Till the 14-year-old Emmett is the hyper-alive center and overwhelming presence of the play. In Benevolence he is present as recent memory in the minds of people who were living in the area where the murder was committed. For these people the memory of his murder and the culture that brought it about were literally in the water. These memories elicited terror in the Black population and a shameless recalcitrance in the white population.

That Summer in Sumner (now receiving its world premiere in Ifa Bayeza’s The Till Trilogy at Mosaic Theater) examines the events surrounding the trial seen through the eyes of Black reporters trying to get the facts of the story. It examines how both the reporters and the family of Emmett Till are stonewalled in their attempts to get the details of the story and in their attempts to get justice.

The trial of the white men who murdered and tortured Emmett Till was a circus. It was a farce. After being found not guilty and knowing they could not be retried for the same crime the perpetrators of the horror sold their story of how they did in fact abduct torture and murder Emmett Till to Look magazine for $4000.

All three plays take place on a creaking wooden set permeable by light and wind that evokes the sense of living in a haunted house. Of the three plays That Summer in Sumner takes the theme of haunting most literally. And the ghost that is doing the haunting in this play is the spirit of Emmett Till himself.

MAMIE: Oh Gene I can hear him! I can hear him chattering about the house but I can’t I can’t see him anymore. I had to identify. I had to identify every piece of him that was left. Now I have to look at his picture to hold him in my mind.

And it’s not just his mother who experiences this ghostly presence. Covering the story of the trial in Sumner David Jackson (Jax) the photographer responsible for the famous iconic picture that galvanized the Civil Rights Movement also hears a man’s voice:

Git yourself to—Glendora. There yoah story. A place called King’s. Looking for a fellah name Too Tight … and a man named Hell. And don’t be there after dark.

When Jax turns to see who it is no one is there. The audience however sees that it’s Emmett Till embodying an anonymous personage of the South. He will continue to appear as the embodiment of some operating principle or person of the South throughout this play

I love a good courtroom drama which is only one of the things that this play is. Weaving elements of this ghost story with courtroom drama and newspaper story from a woman’s point of view (in form the play is like a mashup of the movies Topper 12 Angry Men and His Girl Friday) That Summer in Sumner asserts that in contrast to the worlds created in those movies that tell a mainstream narrative of the western world in which Black people are invisible Black people do in fact exist and far from being fodder for ridicule and entertainment our lives matter. Well before the need for its reiteration in the 21st century after the murder of George Floyd it is an unheralded Black press that we see at the center of this play whose task it is in the 1960s to bring this message to the world:

CLOYTE: We’re not coming down here just to “cover this story” we’re coming to get justice!

In the 1960s it was a rare Black household or barbershop that did not have copies of Ebony Jet or Negro Digest in it. The Black press corps in That Summer in Sumner shows us how these Black reporters were subject to the same forces that destroyed Till. We see how they needed both their own cleverness — and goodwill on the part of some of their white colleagues — in order to get the story and get out alive. The representatives from these three publications we see are Cloyte Murdock (Rolonda Watts) David Jackson/Jax (Vaughn Ryan Midder) Simeon Booker (Jaysen Wright) and their white photographer and reporter Mike Shea (Scott Ward Abernathy). Cloyte Murdock’s experience as the only female member of this team is informative. Rolonda Watts gives an incisive portrait of Murdock as feisty with her colleagues and adept at manipulating the misogyny and white supremacy that she must go through in order to do her job. In her scene with Mamie Till (Billie Krishawn) as two Black women who recognize their shared intersections of oppression and disrespect and who find ways to support each other she says:

CLOYTE: I find it really calming soothing to attend to oneself once in a while. People think Johnson Publications is all John Johnson. Jet and Ebony Negro Digest skyscraper on Michigan Avenue! But Mrs. Johnson is a visionary too. She’s got this whole new idea a line of beauty products exclusively for Negro women. So your lipstick won’t turn purple. “It will keep your skin just as fair and flawless” … as it is now. Come on sit.

The entire crew of reporters does excellent ensemble work displaying the by turns prickly and affectionate relationships of people who are not related to each other by blood but who nevertheless must depend on each other to survive.

That the trial was a circus that was insulting to Black folks and anyone who took even the potential of the idea of “all men are created equal” seriously is something that the playwright Ifa Bayeza gives startling and surrealistic expression to: She has a ghostly — and stuttering — Emmett Till fulfill his dream of becoming a stand-up comedian who accompanied by a pre-recorded laugh track (Kwamina “Binnie” Biney) narrates his life to us onstage in the form of a sardonic “Emmett Till Show”:

BO: Old Thomas Jefferson was onto somethin’ man — and I don’t mean when he was doin’ his wife’s sister’s daughter — they they they got a lot of double fir-first-cousins too — I mean that that that “pursuit of happiness.” That that that that that’s profound you know … Imagine: everybody being entitled to havin’ a good time. Or tryin. Pursuin’ it. Mannn that’s why I love me some jokes.

It’s a disturbing and effective moment performed with deep commitment by Antonio Michael Woodard.

The circus atmosphere is further enhanced by lights that frame the stage platform in a red glow at certain moments (lighting design by Alberto Segarra) and the way Director Talvin Wilks has the reporters pressed around the perimeter of that platform for all intents and purposes becoming part of the theater audience.

Who gets to tell a story of an event that defines a people? Who gets to decide which parts of the story get told and which are buried and forgotten? Does a Black press exist anymore? Who cares for our stories? I read Jet magazine and Ebony all of my life but I had never — not once — given a thought to the lives of the Black journalists who brought us these stories. That Summer in Sumner changed that.

The gallery which was founded by Mónica Manzutto and José Kuri with guidance from artist Gabriel Orozco in 1999 inaugurates the outpost on 11 November with the group show Todos Juntos (All Together)  showcasing works by its entire artist roster. From Adrián Villar Rojas to Danh Võ Abraham Cruzvillegas to Sarah Lucas the 37-artist checklist is a who’s-who of the international arena under the fitting theme of unity which was inspired by Rirkrit Tiravanija’s titular 47ft hammock installation  which was exhibited at the gallery’s Chapultepec district headquarters in 2014.

The new Chelsea space is partly a return to Kurimanzutto’s origins: Manzutto dropped out of her master’s degree study at New York University and quit her job at Marian Goodman Gallery to turn the idea of a gallery back home into reality with Kuri. “We had wanted to create a gallery with no space that responds to the freedom artists in Mexico had at the time with many artist-run spaces within a dynamic setting” she says.

Over the decades Kurimanzutto has evolved from a nomadic endeavor into a global key player recognised for its geographically broad programme artist-led initiatives in and outside of Mexico and a space that often melds elements of a commercial gallery with a non-profit kunsthalle.

Modest in comparison to its Mexico City space’s grandiose scale the gallery’s New York locale was collectively picked by many of its artists. “We showed over half of our artists locations in Tribeca and Chelsea and many chose this space for its flexibility” Manzutto says. She describes the inaugural show there as “a visual story that starts with our first presentation at Mercado de Medellín with 13 artists and follows our trajectory to the present”. The show features pieces from that very first project and others exhibited subsequently as well as new works created in response to the gallery’s history. Wilfredo Prieto and Orozco for example have collaborated for a sound work while Haegue Yang Leonor Antunes and Damián Ortega all sent new sculptures to New York. The gallery’s newest artist Kosovar conceptualist Petrit Halilaj is also making his Kurimanzutto debut with a new piece.

The Chelsea space’s architecture was another collaborative process with the artists. Tiravanija gave input and Orozco provided the final layout to create “a flexible space of encounters such as an office that can function as a bar if needed” Manzutto says. An Oaxaca-based mosaic company that previously collaborated with Orozco provided the tiles for the bathroom and the space’s Janette Laverrière-inspired lamps are an homage to Nairy Baghramian’s former collaboration with the late designer. The design of the front desk and the bench were helmed by another gallery artist Gabriel Sierra.

Kurimanzutto will extend the show’s life with a brochure that documents key moments in and outside of the gallery such as 2020-2021’s public art project Titan which took over New York City phone booths with works by 12 gallery artists. After the space’s inaugural group show will be the New York solo debut of Mexico City-based artist Minerva Cuevas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlZWl0bWFya2V0LmNvbS90aGVzZS0zLWNvbXBhbmllcy1hcmUtc2V0LXVwLXRvLXJlcG9ydC1iYWQtbmV3cy10aGlzLXdlZWsv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These 3 Companies Are Set Up to Report Bad News This Week,"The following research was contributed to by Christine Short VP of Research at Wall Street Horizon.

This is a 0.5 percentage point decrease from where expectations stood on Sept 30 and marks the lowest growth rate in two years. (Data from FactSet)

As with every earnings season a majority of blue chip names are beating analysts’ expectations but at a much lower rate for Q3.

Currently 70% of companies have surpassed sell-side profit expectations as compared to the 5-year average of 77%. The percentage by which companies are beating is also subdued at just 2.2% vs. the 10-year average of 6.5%. (Data from FactSet).

Forward looking estimates are also being revised downward with Q4 expectations turning negative in the last week now anticipated to report a YoY decline of 1%. Calendar year 2023 estimates still remain inflated at 5.9% but that number has started to fall (from 8.1% on September 30) as analysts downgrade due to the strong dollar economic slowdown and the fall of some big tech names.

Despite the volatile earnings season companies continue to engage in and authorize share repurchase programs a benefit to shareholders. It is expected that 2022 will be a record for total dollars used to buy back stocks at an estimated $1T surpassing the previous record last year which topped $900M. This is ahead of the new 1% buyback excise tax set to begin in January 2023.

What will the Last Week of Peak Earnings Season Bring?

This week we get Q3 results from 33 S&P 500 companies from a smattering of sectors. Big names to watch include Lyft (LYFT) after their recent announcement of a significant workforce reduction TripAdvisor (TRIP) for a further read on the travel industry and Walt Disney (DIS) for an update on the streaming wars. We also start to get results from some apparel and accessories names such as Tapestry (TPR) Ralph Lauren (RL) and Warby Parker (WRBY).

Potential Surprises in the Week Ahead

This week we get results from a number of large companies on major indexes that have pushed their Q3 earnings dates past their historical norms. Five companies within the S&P 500 confirmed outlier earnings dates for this week all of which are later than usual and therefore have negative DateBreaks Factors*. Those five names are The Mosaic Company (MOS) NiSource (NI) DuPont de Nemours (DD) Steris (STE) and Becton Dickinson & Company (BDX).

NiSource Inc (NI)

Company Confirmed Report Date: Monday November 7 BMO

Projected Report Date (based on historical data): Wednesday November 2 BMO

DateBreaks Factor: -3*

NiSource typically reports Q3 results during the first week of November and they have done so for the last 8 years. There is no day of the week trend but over the last four years NI has reported on a Monday or Wednesday. The confirmed report date of November 7 is five days later than forecasted potentially signaling bad news will be delivered on the upcoming call.

DuPont de Nemours (DD)

Company Confirmed Report Date: Tuesday November 8 BMO

Projected Report Date (based on historical data): Tuesday November 1 BMO

DateBreaks Factor: -3*

Dupont historically has reported Q3 results during the last week of October or the first week of November on a Tuesday or Thursday. As such a report date of November 2 was set. On October 20 DD confirmed an earnings report date of November 8 the latest they’ve reported third quarter results in our 7 year history for that name. This also continues the trend started last year of Tuesday reports after regularly reporting on Thursdays.

Becton Dickinson & Company (BDX)

Company Confirmed Report Date: Thursday November 10 BMO

Projected Report Date (based on historical data): Thursday November 3 BMO

DateBreaks Factor: -3*

Becton Dickinson & Company typically reports their fiscal Q4 results during the first week of November on a Tuesday or Thursday. On October 13 the company confirmed they would release results on November 10 their latest report date in our 10 years of BDX data. This suggests they will share bad news on the call.

Q3 2022 Earnings Wave – Peak Season Continues

November 10 will be the heaviest report day of the week with 880 companies expected to report. Thus far 80% of companies have confirmed their earnings date and 47% have reported.

Home-biased investors in China may neglect long-term growth and diversification opportunities through a lack of consideration of foreign equity exposure.

A hypothetical portfolio representing a simple fixed-weight combination of the MSCI China A 50 Connect and MSCI USA 50 Indexes achieved a tradeoff between risk and other characteristics.

This year has been characterized by increasing geopolitical tensions rising inflation and monetary tightening around the world. For Chinese investors COVID-19 lockdowns increasing volatility of the Chinese yuan and concerns about economic decoupling may also have implications for asset-allocation strategies.

Amid this backdrop outbound investing has been an increasing trend in China. The qualified domestic institutional investor (QDII) quota the only scheme available to Chinese investors to invest in offshore markets rose 35% in 2021.1 Our focus in this blog post is Chinese investors — who are considered home-biased since they allocate around 95% of their equity investments in China2 — and the potential opportunities and risks inherent in global investing.

US and China: The largest economies and equity markets

For Chinese investors who have not implemented global investing on a full scale it’s worth noting that the U.S. and China represent two of the largest economies and equity markets. Due to their historically complementary exposures they may also represent divergent growth opportunities.

Looking at the exhibit below we see that the U.S. and China contributed 14% and 28% respectively of the five-year global real GDP growth. Meanwhile the U.S. and China weights of the MSCI World Index and the MSCI Emerging Markets (EM) Index have represented an outsized contribution over the past decade representing 69.7% and 31.3% respectively.

GDP growth contribution and weight

Calculation based on IMF WEO databases. Data as of April 2022. Index weight data as of Sept. 30 2022.

Complementary market exposures and diversification opportunities

The historical return correlation between the U.S. and China from January 2012 to September 2022 was about 46% below the average correlation of markets in the MSCI World Index during the same period. A few reasons for this relatively low historical correlation were the differences in the policy objectives and growth drivers of these two economies as well as their economies and equity markets being in different stages of development.

The exhibit below shows that the MSCI USA Index had higher exposure to the information technology and health care sectors while MSCI China and China A were dominated by consumer discretionary communication services industrials consumer staples and materials. From a thematic lens the U.S. market provided exposure to newly-emerged themes that were missing in China such as blockchain and cybersecurity. For themes like future mobility China and the U.S. cover the global leaders in the value chain. Chinese companies also source revenue mainly from the domestic market while the MSCI USA Index generated only 60% of its revenue from its home base.

Sector economic and thematic exposure varied across the US and China

Data as of Sept. 30 2022.

Case Study: Managing US and China exposures within a single portfolio

In this case study we assess diversification effects by using the MSCI China A 50 Connect Index and the MSCI USA 50 Index to construct a hypothetical mega-cap USA/China portfolio.3 We chose these as building blocks given that the MSCI China A50 Connect and MSCI USA 50 Indexes covered 40% to 50% of the market cap and profit of their corresponding parent indexes as well as a significant share of risk in the MSCI USA Index and the MSCI China A Index as shown in exhibit below.

Historical risk contributions

We simulated scenarios of combined China/USA indexes with fixed-weight allocation to the MSCI China A50 Connect Index and the MSCI USA 50 Index to evaluate the potential tradeoff between portfolio risk and other outcomes such as earnings-per-share (EPS) growth carbon intensity and revenue sources.

The exhibit below shows a hypothetical portfolio with a 100% China allocation that derives 80% of its revenue from its domestic market 19.5% EPS growth and 295 tons of carbon emissions per USD 1 million in sales. The portfolio reached minimal ex-ante total risk of 18.9% at 40% China A and 60% U.S. allocation where 39.3% of the revenue came from China 32.9% from the U.S. and 27.8% from rest of the world. EPS growth was 15.6% and carbon intensity was 166.1tCO2e/USD 1 million of sales.

Efficient frontier of a China/US mega-cap portfolio

Total risk is calculated based on MSCI Barra Global Equity Model (GEMLT) as of Sept. 30 2022.

It aims to reflect the performance of the 50 largest securities representing each Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS®) sector and reflecting the sector weight allocation of the parent index. GICS is the global industry classification standard jointly developed by MSCI and Standard & Poor’s. The MSCI USA 50 Index is constructed from the MSCI USA Index selecting the largest 50 securities in the parent index by their free float market capitalization.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection check out 5 Best Auto Stocks To Buy Now.

The automotive sector is one of the most rate-sensitive segments of the economy and the Federal Reserve’s hawkish moves this year have left a mark on the industry in terms of higher borrowing costs for both auto suppliers and original original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Research and development investments as well as other capital expenditures are now more expensive. This will cut into auto margins which were running high after the pandemic eased and pent-up consumer demand hit the markets. However prices of automobiles are also rising simultaneously especially as the industry shifts towards electrification of vehicles.

According to McKinsey the automotive revenues will meaningfully increase as the market transitions towards on-demand mobility and data-driven services. This could add up to $1.5 trillion in additional revenue by 2030 compared to roughly $5.2 trillion from conventional car sales and aftermarket products/services. Although global car sales will continue to grow the annual growth rate is forecasted to decline from 3.6% over the last five years to approximately 2% by 2030. This drop will be primarily driven by macroeconomic factors and the rise of latest mobility trends such as carpooling and e-hailing.

However emerging trends will continue to surprise the auto sector and some of the best stocks to pick up in the space include Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) and Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN).

Rumor on Chinese Reopening

Wall Street was ripe with the rumor that China may relax its zero-tolerance on COVID-19 policies and is likely to reopen its economy in phased manner. Globally China is the largest supplier of the low-cost industrial inputs and the largest buyer of high-end products. Therefore reopening of the Chinese economy will ease global inflationary pressures especially the record-high inflation rate in the United States.

Following the rumor the shares of the Chinese e-commerce that are traded in the U.S. markets like Pinduoduo Inc. PDD Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA and JD.com Inc. JD have jumped 8.6% 7.1% and 9.7% respectively. Pinduoduo and JD.com carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

New reports said Trump could formally announce his plan on Nov. 14 to run as the Republican nominee for president in the 2024 election.

Here’s a look at stocks to watch if Trump does announce his plans for the election.

What Happened: Trump won the 2016 presidential election over Hillary Clinton and served as the leader of the U.S. for four years. Trump lost a re-election bid in the 2020 presidential election to former Vice President Joe Biden.

Trump is now considering running for president which could set up a rematch with Biden if the two former presidents win their respective party nominations.

“In order to make our country successful and safe and glorious I will very very very probably do it again” Trump said recently.

Stocks to Watch Now: The biggest stock to watch if Trump announces his nomination is Digital World Acquisition Corporation (NASDAQ:DWAC). The SPAC has a pending merger with Trump Media & Technology Group the social media and media company owned by Trump.

Shares of Digital World Acquisition jumped Monday on news of Trump’s rumored bid. The deal still faces several setbacks and investigations and has another vote planned on Nov. 22 to extend the merger voting period to September 2023. Without voter approval getting the SPAC deal done in time could face significant struggles and could mean the SPAC is no longer linked to Trump.

Video platform Rumble Inc (NASDAQ:RUM) is another social media-related stock to watch on the potential Trump announcement. With a ban by Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL)-owned YouTube Trump has often posted videos on Rumble including some of his campaign videos in the past.

Black Rifle Coffee Company (NYSE:BRCC) is a veteran-founded coffee company with a subscription plan and physical stores. The company went public via SPAC merger and has often been linked to the conservative party. The company received positive mentions from several prominent Republican voices including the former president’s son Donald Trump Jr. who also appeared on the company’s podcast.

“Great coffee great guys and great Americans” Donald Trump Jr. previously said about the company.

Enterprise software company Phunware Inc (NASDAQ:PHUN) has been flagged as a Trump-sensitive stock by Benzinga Pro meaning it often moves in reaction to major news on the former president. Phunware previously worked with Trump to design the official app for his 2020 presidential campaign. Phunware has not had a confirmed connection with Trump since then but could work with Trump in the future.

Media company Fox Corp (NASDAQ:FOX)(NASDAQ:FOXA) has been linked to being a conservative media outlet. The company hosted Trump for interviews and phone calls on its Fox News channel several times and could land some big interviews with Trump after a possible formal announcement for the candidacy is announced.

Launched in 2017 the Point Bridge America First ETF (BATS:MAGA) isn’t a full-on Donald Trump stock or ETF but its ticker of MAGA alone could see it have a positive reaction to Trump’s announcement. The MAGA ticker is in line with Trump’s acronym for “Make America Great Again” which was a slogan and rallying cry for Trump in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections.

The ETF tracks companies in the S&P 500 that make donations to the Republican Party.

Stocks to Watch Later: If Trump does announce his intent on running for president it will set up a long two-year battle with other potential Republican candidates such as the current Florida Governor Ron DeSantis who is facing reelection tomorrow. Trump would also face a battle with a Democratic candidate if he wins the Republican nomination.

The following list includes stocks that won’t move as much on news of Trump running for president but could be movers if Trump gets the Republican nomination and gets closer to possibly being elected the president again.

The automaker sector could be one impacted by the 2024 election with Trump not a big of a supporter of electric vehicles and federal credits as Biden and the Democratic Congress. Traditional automaker companies such as General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) could benefit from Trump winning the next presidency because it would allow them more time to transition to electric vehicles. Likewise Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) could be hurt by a president that doesn’t fully support electric vehicles. Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk have butt heads previously.

Defense stocks are often seen as beneficiaries under Republican-led presidents and Congress. Trump getting the nomination for president could lead to stocks such as Boeing Inc (NYSE:BA) Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE:LMT) and Northrop Grumman Corp (NYSE:NOC) seeing a boost in their share price. Trump was known for being a supporter of a strong U.S. military and world presence during his first presidential term.

Known for high volatility around times of political unrest or protest in the U.S. Digital Ally Inc (NASDAQ:DGLY) which provides body cams and video systems for law enforcement and Axon Enterprise Inc (NASDAQ:AXON) which develops technology and weapons products could be volatile as the next presidential election gets underway. There is a strong possibility of protests no matter who gets elected into office.

These customers often tell Amazon Web Services (AWS) they want to migrate their applications to AWS Cloud as part of their business strategy: to lower costs gain agility and innovate faster.

In this blog we will explore how customers who are looking at ways to run IBM software on AWS can use Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) to deploy IBM Cloud Pak for Integration (CP4I) with modernized versions of IBM integration products.

As ROSA is a fully managed OpenShift service that is jointly supported by AWS and Red Hat plus managed by Red Hat site reliability engineers customers benefit from not having to manage the lifecycle of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) clusters.

This post explains the steps to:

Create a ROSA cluster

Configure persistent storage

Install CP4I and the IBM MQ 9.3 operator

Cloud Pak for integration architecture

In this blog we are implementing a highly available ROSA cluster with three Availability Zones (AZ) three master nodes three infrastructure nodes and three worker nodes.

Review the AWS documentation for Regions and AZs and the regions where ROSA is available to choose the best region for your deployment.

Figure 1 demonstrates the solution’s architecture.

In our scenario we are building a public ROSA cluster with an internet-facing Classic Load Balancer providing access to Ports 80 and 443. Consider using a ROSA private cluster when you are deploying CP4I in your AWS account.

We are using Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) and Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) for our cluster’s persistent storage. Review the IBM CP4I documentation for information about supported AWS storage options.

Review AWS prerequisites for ROSA and AWS Security best practices in IAM documentation before deploying CP4I for production workloads to protect your AWS account and resources.

Cost

You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used when deploying CP4I in your AWS account. For cost estimates see the pricing pages for each AWS service you use.

Prerequisites

Before getting started review the following prerequisites:

Installation steps

To deploy CP4I on ROSA complete the following steps:

From the AWS ROSA console click Enable ROSA to active the service on your AWS account (Figure 2). Create an AWS Cloud9 environment to run your CP4I installation. We used a t3.small instance type. When it comes up close the Welcome tab and open a new Terminal tab to install the required packages: curl ""https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip"" -o ""awscliv2.zip"" unzip awscliv2.zip sudo ./aws/install wget https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/rosa/latest/rosa-linux.tar.gz sudo tar -xvzf rosa-linux.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin/ rosa download oc sudo tar -xvzf openshift-client-linux.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin/ sudo yum -y install jq gettext Ensure the ELB service-linked role exists in your AWS account: aws iam get-role --role-name ""AWSServiceRoleForElasticLoadBalancing"" || aws iam create-service-linked-role --aws-service-name ""elasticloadbalancing.amazonaws.com"" Create an IAM policy named cp4i-installer-permissions with the following permissions: { ""Version"": ""2012-10-17"" ""Statement"": [ { ""Effect"": ""Allow"" ""Action"": [ ""autoscaling:*"" ""cloudformation:*"" ""cloudwatch:*"" ""ec2:*"" ""elasticfilesystem:*"" ""elasticloadbalancing:*"" ""events:*"" ""iam:*"" ""kms:*"" ""logs:*"" ""route53:*"" ""s3:*"" ""servicequotas:GetRequestedServiceQuotaChange"" ""servicequotas:GetServiceQuota"" ""servicequotas:ListServices"" ""servicequotas:ListServiceQuotas"" ""servicequotas:RequestServiceQuotaIncrease"" ""sts:*"" ""support:*"" ""tag:*"" ] ""Resource"": ""*"" } ] } Create an IAM role: Select AWS service and EC2 then click Next: Permissions. Select the cp4i-installer-permissions policy and click Next. Name it cp4i-installer and click Create role. From your AWS Cloud9 IDE click the grey circle button on the top right and select Manage EC2 Instance (Figure 3). On the Amazon EC2 console select the AWS Cloud9 instance then choose Actions / Security / Modify IAM Role. Choose cp4i-installer from the IAM Role drop down and click Update IAM role (Figure 4). Update the IAM settings for your AWS Cloud9 workspace: aws cloud9 update-environment --environment-id $C9_PID --managed-credentials-action DISABLE rm -vf ${HOME}/.aws/credentials Configure the following environment variables: export ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --output text --query Account) export AWS_REGION=$(curl -s 169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document | jq -r '.region') export ROSA_CLUSTER_NAME=cp4iblog01 Configure the aws cli default region: aws configure set default.region ${AWS_REGION} Navigate to the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console and copy your OpenShift Cluster Manager API Token. Use the token and log in to your Red Hat account: rosa login --token=<your_openshift_api_token> Verify that your AWS account satisfies the quotas to deploy your cluster: rosa verify quota When deploying ROSA for the first time create the account-wide roles: rosa create account-roles --mode auto --yes Create your ROSA cluster: rosa create cluster --cluster-name $ROSA_CLUSTER_NAME --sts \ --multi-az \ --region $AWS_REGION \ --version 4.10.35 \ --compute-machine-type m5.4xlarge \ --compute-nodes 3 \ --operator-roles-prefix cp4irosa \ --mode auto --yes \ --watch Once your cluster is ready create a cluster-admin user (it takes approximately 5 minutes): rosa create admin --cluster=$ROSA_CLUSTER_NAME Log in to your cluster using the cluster-admin credentials. You can copy the command from the output of the previous step. For example: oc login https://<your_cluster_api_address>:6443 \ --username cluster-admin \ --password <your_cluster-admin_password> Create an IAM policy allowing ROSA to use Amazon EFS: cat <<EOF > $PWD/efs-policy.json { ""Version"": ""2012-10-17"" ""Statement"": [ { ""Effect"": ""Allow"" ""Action"": [ ""elasticfilesystem:DescribeAccessPoints"" ""elasticfilesystem:DescribeFileSystems"" ] ""Resource"": ""*"" } { ""Effect"": ""Allow"" ""Action"": [ ""elasticfilesystem:CreateAccessPoint"" ] ""Resource"": ""*"" ""Condition"": { ""StringLike"": { ""aws:RequestTag/efs.csi.aws.com/cluster"": ""true"" } } } { ""Effect"": ""Allow"" ""Action"": ""elasticfilesystem:DeleteAccessPoint"" ""Resource"": ""*"" ""Condition"": { ""StringEquals"": { ""aws:ResourceTag/efs.csi.aws.com/cluster"": ""true"" } } } ] } EOF POLICY=$(aws iam create-policy --policy-name ""${ROSA_CLUSTER_NAME}-cp4i-efs-csi"" --policy-document file://$PWD/efs-policy.json --query 'Policy.Arn' --output text) || POLICY=$(aws iam list-policies --query 'Policies[?PolicyName==`cp4i-efs-csi`].Arn' --output text) Create an IAM trust policy: export OIDC_PROVIDER=$(oc get authentication.config.openshift.io cluster -o json | jq -r .spec.serviceAccountIssuer| sed -e ""s/^https:\/\///"") cat <<EOF > $PWD/TrustPolicy.json { ""Version"": ""2012-10-17"" ""Statement"": [ { ""Effect"": ""Allow"" ""Principal"": { ""Federated"": ""arn:aws:iam::${ACCOUNT_ID}:oidc-provider/${OIDC_PROVIDER}"" } ""Action"": ""sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity"" ""Condition"": { ""StringEquals"": { ""${OIDC_PROVIDER}:sub"": [ ""system:serviceaccount:openshift-cluster-csi-drivers:aws-efs-csi-driver-operator"" ""system:serviceaccount:openshift-cluster-csi-drivers:aws-efs-csi-driver-controller-sa"" ] } } } ] } EOF Create an IAM role with the previously created policies: ROLE=$(aws iam create-role \ --role-name ""${ROSA_CLUSTER_NAME}-aws-efs-csi-operator"" \ --assume-role-policy-document file://$PWD/TrustPolicy.json \ --query ""Role.Arn"" --output text) aws iam attach-role-policy \ --role-name ""${ROSA_CLUSTER_NAME}-aws-efs-csi-operator"" \ --policy-arn $POLICY Create an OpenShift secret to store the AWS access keys: cat <<EOF | oc apply -f - apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: aws-efs-cloud-credentials namespace: openshift-cluster-csi-drivers stringData: credentials: |- [default] role_arn = $ROLE web_identity_token_file = /var/run/secrets/openshift/serviceaccount/token EOF Install the Amazon EFS CSI driver operator: cat <<EOF | oc create -f - apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1 kind: OperatorGroup metadata: generateName: openshift-cluster-csi-drivers- namespace: openshift-cluster-csi-drivers --- apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1 kind: Subscription metadata: labels: operators.coreos.com/aws-efs-csi-driver-operator.openshift-cluster-csi-drivers: """" name: aws-efs-csi-driver-operator namespace: openshift-cluster-csi-drivers spec: channel: stable installPlanApproval: Automatic name: aws-efs-csi-driver-operator source: redhat-operators sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace EOF Track the operator installation: watch oc get deployment aws-efs-csi-driver-operator \ -n openshift-cluster-csi-drivers Install the AWS EFS CSI driver: cat <<EOF | oc apply -f - apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1 kind: ClusterCSIDriver metadata: name: efs.csi.aws.com spec: managementState: Managed EOF Wait until the CSI driver is running: watch oc get daemonset aws-efs-csi-driver-node \ -n openshift-cluster-csi-drivers Create a rule allowing inbound NFS traffic from your cluster’s VPC Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR): NODE=$(oc get nodes --selector=node-role.kubernetes.io/worker -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') VPC_ID=$(aws ec2 describe-instances --filters ""Name=private-dns-nameValues=$NODE"" --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].{VpcId:VpcId}' | jq -r '.[0][0].VpcId') CIDR=$(aws ec2 describe-vpcs --filters ""Name=vpc-idValues=$VPC_ID"" --query 'Vpcs[*].CidrBlock' | jq -r '.[0]') SG=$(aws ec2 describe-instances --filters ""Name=private-dns-nameValues=$NODE"" --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].{SecurityGroups:SecurityGroups}' | jq -r '.[0][0].SecurityGroups[0].GroupId') aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \ --group-id $SG \ --protocol tcp \ --port 2049 \ --cidr $CIDR | jq .

Run the commands to retrieve the CP4I URL and administrator password: oc describe platformnavigator integration-quickstart \ -n integration | grep ""^.*UI Endpoint"" | xargs | cut -d ' ' -f3 oc get secret platform-auth-idp-credentials \ -n ibm-common-services -o jsonpath='{.data.admin_password}' \ | base64 -d && echo Using the information from the previous step access your CP4I web console. Select the option to authenticate with the IBM provided credentials (admin only) to login with your admin password. From the CP4I console you can manage users and groups allowed to access the platform install new operators and view the components that are installed. Click qmgr-inst01 in the Messaging widget to bring up your IBM MQ setup (Figure 8). In the Welcome to IBM MQ panel click the CP4IQMGR queue manager. This shows the state resources and allows you to configure your instances (Figure 9).

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed IBM CP4I on Red Hat OpenShift on AWS.

Post installation

Review the following topics when you are installing CP4I on production environments:

Cleanup

Connect to your Cloud9 workspace and run the following steps to delete the CP4I installation including ROSA. This avoids incurring future charges on your AWS account:

EFS_EF_ID=$(aws efs describe-file-systems \ --query 'FileSystems[?Name==`ibm_cp4i_fs`].FileSystemId' \ --output text) MOUNT_TARGETS=$(aws efs describe-mount-targets --file-system-id $EFS_EF_ID --query 'MountTargets[*].MountTargetId' --output text) for mt in ${MOUNT_TARGETS[@]}; do aws efs delete-mount-target --mount-target-id $mt done aws efs delete-file-system --file-system-id $EFS_EF_ID rosa delete cluster -c $ROSA_CLUSTER_NAME --yes --region $AWS_REGION

Monitor your cluster uninstallation logs run:

rosa logs uninstall -c $ROSA_CLUSTER_NAME --watch

Once the cluster is uninstalled remove the operator-roles and oidc-provider as informed in the output of the rosa delete command. For example:

rosa delete operator-roles -c 1vepskr2ms88ki76k870uflun2tjpvfs --mode auto –yes rosa delete oidc-provider -c 1vepskr2ms88ki76k870uflun2tjpvfs --mode auto --yes

Recently we detailed what one startup was working on to help bridge that CXL memory gap by mashing up a combination of Gen-Z transports and protocols with CXL at the endpoints of servers and memory devices. Now we have another on that is using a mix of OpenCAPI and a PCI-Express 5.0 switch that is coming out from a new vendor plus the CXL protocol on servers to create sharable extended memory that will range up to 16 TB on a single memory appliance.

That company called TORmem which is short for top-of-rack memory was founded in March 2021 by Thao Nguyen who is the company’s chief executive officer and Steven White who is chief technology officer.

Nguyen got his bachelors in electrical engineering at the University of Missouri and his masters at Syracuse University and did a number of logic design and product development jobs for IBM before joining the technical staff at NetApp’s compute and storage engineering division. Things got really interesting for Nguyen when he joined Facebook and was director of Open Compute compliance and interoperability at the social network where was put in charge of managing the manufacturing and deployment of millions of servers for Facebook based on Open Compute Project standards. He left Facebook to become vice president of hardware engineering and distinguished hardware engineer at the hosting company Packet and moved over to Equinix as Principal of hardware engineering after Equinix acquired Packet in January 2020 for $335 million.

While both Facebook Packet and Equinix all deal with stranded server memory Nguyen was watching the evolution of OpenCAPI CXL and other memory sharing technologies as well as the steady bandwidth increases of the PCI-Express interconnect and a little more than a year ago decided to build a family of memory appliances based on CXL on the front end and OpenCAPI on the backend with a PCI-Express switching complex bringing them together to create an appliance that can both pool memory like a SAN does disk or flash storage as well as share memory – meaning multiple servers can literally access the same physical memory over the PCI-Express fabric so data does not have to be moved.

The nitty-gritty of making all of these things work together falls on White who got his bachelors in electrical engineering from West Virginia University back in 1999 when the dot-com boom was roaring and White could set up his own shop to help companies prototype and test all kinds of gear.

In the summer of 2011 when Chris Kemp the former NASA CTO who helped create the “Nebula” cloud controller that formed the compute half what became OpenStack left NASA to create a management appliance (also called Nebula) version of OpenStack Kemp chose White to be principle hardware engineer and hardware architect for the company he called Nebula. Many of the Rackspace and OpenStack people eventually went on to create Vapor IO which originally designed innovative circular datacenter designs but which has subsequently taken the automation created for those datacenter designs and turned it into a control plane for national-scale edge computing. White was a co-founder and vice president of hardware engineering at Vapor IO and wanted to get back to hardware when he ran across Nguyen last year.

“It’s funny” Nguyen tells The Next Platform. “Eight years ago my vice president at Facebook asked me to tackle this memory disaggregation problem because memory costs a lot of money but we also did not have any expertise in memory chips and we did not have any internal designs. After my time at Facebook we got together and decided to tackle this problem.”

Like all of the other CXL memory startups we have looked at so far TORmem is implementing some of its key technologies using FPGAs but is working towards creating specific chips to do its particular flavor of memory sharing. Frankly the protocols are changing so fast and are converging in somewhat unpredictable ways now that Gen-Z and OpenCAPI technology has been absorbed by the CXL Consortium.

The reason that TORmem has chosen IBM’s OpenCAPI Memory Interface – the same OMI spec that Big Blue uses for its Power10 servers and that it opened up and donated to the CXL Consortium – is the same reason that IBM developed OpenCAPI memory in the first place. It takes a lot fewer wires to do a serial interconnect than it does a parallel one.

To get started TORmem is taking an X86 server loaded up with its memory management stack and allowing connectivity to a memory server over InfiniBand or Ethernet with RoCE. This is called the M1000 and it will be available in June 2023.

This M1000 development platform has a pair of Epyc 7313 processors from AMD and 32 memory slots that can host up to 8 TB of memory.

With the M4000 which is in development now and scheduled for production in Q4 2023 the TORmem architecture will be brought to market for the first time.

To create the memory sleds for its initial M4000 memory appliances White says that TORmem had to balance the cost of various sizes of FPGAs against the number of lanes it would take to drive a reasonable amount of memory bandwidth and capacity. Looking at the options for making a memory sled for its appliance White says that putting 16 modules per FPGA-based OMI was optimal.

“The FPGA pin count requirement for 16 parallel interface memory modules pushes FPGA prices to unacceptable levels” White tells The Next Platform. “If you do the math connecting 16 memory modules with parallel interfaces to one chip that is hundreds of signals. And you just can’t get an affordable FPGA that can do that. The key to getting all this memory attached to one chip is to go with a serial memory interface and even before IBM’s OMI was pulled into the CXL Consortium we chose it for this reason. But importantly OMI is using serial lanes just like PCI-Express is with access to the memory. So that cuts down the pin count and that allows us to get things connected to the FPGA in a much denser method with without sacrificing any performance.”

The M4000 will have a PCI-Express 4.0 switch with 100 lanes of I/O plus three OMI memory controllers (one per memory sled) implemented in FPGAs that front end a total of 48 OMI differential DIMMs with 12 TB of capacity using 256 GB memory sticks. The M4000 device will have three PCI-Express Gen 4.0 slots for external connectivity and will run a memory access protocol developed by TORmem that works on PCI-Express 4.0 fabrics and does not require PCI-Express 5.0 switching like CXL does.

With the M5000 memory appliance which is expected to launch in Q2 2024 the memory server will be able to support memory pooling and will use the CXL 2.0 protocol atop a PCI-Express 5.0 fabric set up inside the box like this:

The TORmem M5000 memory server will have four FPGAs that implement the PCI-Express 5.0 and CXL 2.0 protocols on one side and the OMI serial interface on the other side linking out to a total of 64 OMI differential DIMMs and a maximum capacity of 16 TB using 256 GB differential DIMMs. It is reasonable to assume this will be a four-sled design based on the diagram but TORmem has not been specific. Each sled will have four PCI-Express 5.0 x16 slots coming off the FPGAs linking out to an integrated 144 lane PCI-Express 5.0 switch. (TORmem is also looking at a 256 lane PCI-Express 5.0 switch to use here possibly.)

All of these devices above will support memory sharing – allowing for dynamic allocation of memory blocks that a server can use as main memory in addition to or as a replacement for its own internal DRAM. And it will not be until TORmem has raised some venture capital the CXL protocols settle down a bit and it creates a custom ASIC and replaces the FPGAs that it will support memory sharing according to Nguyen. And that is expected to happen in 2024 but it will all depend on when the CXL 3.0 and PCI-Express 6.0 protocols are done and come into commercial being.",,,,,,,,,

Thursday marked the launch of Netflix's cheaper ad-supported tier in the US and eight other countries after it rolled out in Canada and Mexico on Tuesday.

The world's biggest subscription video service Netflix grew into a behemoth partly thanks to its strategy of making shows and movies available in ad-free binges. Back when traditional commercial-packed TV was the main way people watched Netflix pitched itself as the alternative that wouldn't interrupt the flow of your programming with advertising nor would it make you wait week to week to watch your next episode. Building itself into a giant by going against the grain of the TV industry Netflix spent years dismissing the notion of advertising on its service.

Fast forward to today: Netflix is the one behind the times. Nearly all of Hollywood's major media companies have launched their own streaming services to take on Netflix including Apple TV Plus Disney Plus HBO Max Peacock and Paramount Plus. And as they rolled out they introduced features that have now become the norm customers expect including an option to pay less if you watch ads.

Nearly every one of Netflix's new competitors offers a cheaper tier with advertising. (The lone holdout besides Netflix Apple TV Plus is reportedly considering ads too.) Now Netflix grappling earlier this year with its first membership declines in a decade has reversed course to add advertising as well.

Here are the biggest things to know.

Does Netflix have ads?

Starting this week Netflix began running ads alongside its streaming shows and movies for the first time but only in select countries and only if you subscribe to a new tier called Basic with Ads. If you want to keep watching Netflix without advertising the service still has the same ad-free memberships.

When will Netflix add advertising?

If you're already a Netflix subscriber who has never seen ads you still won't. But if you want to pay less for Netflix every month in exchange for sitting through ad breaks during your streaming you can sign up for a new Basic with Ads account.

The new Basic with Ads membership option has been launching this month across 12 countries. It started with rollouts in Canada and Mexico on Tuesday. Thursday the new tier went live in the US Australia Brazil France Germany Italy Japan South Korea and the UK. Next it will widen to Spain on Tuesday starting at 9 a.m. PT.

Not long after the company first indicated publicly it was open to an ad-supported tier in April it said in July that it was ""targeting to launch ... around the early part of 2023."" But then reports said Netflix moved up the launch date to better compete with Disney Plus' own ad-tier launch in December.

How much does the ad-supported tier cost?

In the US Basic with Ads is $7 a month a savings of $3 monthly compared with the cheapest ad-free membership. That's cheapest Netflix has every offered a stand-alone streaming subscription in the US.

By comparison in the US:

Disney Plus will start charging $8 a month for its ad-supported subscription and $11 a month for its ad-free membership starting Dec. 8. (For now it charges $8 a month for ad-free streaming.)

Hulu is $8 a month with ads and $15 a month ad-free.

Paramount Plus charges $5 for its tier with advertising and $10 for the ad-free version.

HBO Max is $10 a month if you watch with ads or $15 a month to strip out all commercials.

Peacock lets you stream a portion of its catalog free with advertising while its paid subscriptions -- which unlock its full library -- are $5 a month with ads and $10 a month without ads.

A full country-by-country price rundown for Basic with Ads is at the end of this article.

Are the other tiers' prices going up?

No Netflix isn't increasing the prices of its existing plans.

It's a reasonable question: Disney Plus is going to hike prices for its existing ad-free membership when it launches an ad-free tier Dec. 8.

In the past Netflx has bumped its prices higher roughly every two years but lately it has sped up the pace: Its last price hike in the US was announced in January which was barely more than one year after the previous one. This quicker cadence may feel like a warning of more hikes to come but every time Netflix raises prices it also has to deal with what's known as churn or the rate of cancellations. Generally Netflix has characterized its churn after a price increase as manageable calling it an ""adjustment period"" of ""slightly higher churn."" But with Netflix so spooked by its existing membership declines so far -- including some cancellations this year that were prompted by the latest price increase -- the company is unlikely to tempt fate by raising prices again so soon.

Last month Netflix confirmed its existing tiers will stay the same price.

What are all the Netflix plans and their prices in the US?

Until now Netflix had three tiers of subscriptions at different prices all of them ad-free: Basic Standard and Premium. In select countries including the US Netflix now has four tiers:

$7-a-month Basic with Ads which matches the features of the ad-free Basic plan described below but with one big exception: It doesn't let you download to watch offline.

$10-a-month Basic which allows you one simultaneous stream one device with downloads and 720p HD quality video.

$15.50-a-month Standard which allows you two simultaneous streams two devices with downloads and 1080p HD video quality.

$20-a-month Premium which allows you to have four simultaneous streams four devices with downloads and video quality in 4K and HDR.

Are the current plans changing with the launch of ads?

The Standard and Premium plans are unchanged.

The ad-free Basic tier has one change: With the launch of Basic with Ads the ad-free Basic tier is getting bumped up to a higher video image quality -- both Basic and Basic with Ads are getting 720p HD quality video after HD was previously reserved for Standard subscriptions.

How do I sign up for a Basic with Ads plan?

Once the new tier is live in the country where you live you can either sign up for it as a new member or switch your existing subscription to the cheaper tier.

If you're a new Netflix member you can sign up for the Basic with Ads plan as you would for any other Netflix plan as soon as the new tier goes live in your country.

If you are already a Netflix subscriber you can switch your plan to Basic with Ads by logging into your Netflix account. By clicking on ""Plan Details"" you can select ""Change Plan."" If you don't see the option for Basic with Ads it's possible that you have Netflix through a third-party billing partner or with a package -- you'll need to contact that provider to confirm whether the ad-supported plan is available.

If you still can't find Basic with Ads you may be using an incompatible device -- a few devices won't stream Netflix if you have a Basic with Ads account. Apple TV for example doesn't support streaming on the new cheaper tier. Neither does Playstation 3 although PS4 and PS5 do. Netflix has a support page with some guidance by device.

How many ads will I have to watch on Netflix?



Netflix said it will average no more than four to five minutes of advertising each hour. Ad breaks will happen both before your program starts (known as preroll) and in the middle of your programming at a scene change (known as midroll). Netflix is aiming to have ""some very tight frequency caps so that members don't see the same ad repeatedly"" Chief Operating Officer Greg Peters said.

By comparison when HBO Max launched its ad-supported tier last year it said its ad load would be less than four minutes per hour. Disney Plus has said that it's aiming to average four minutes of advertising per hour for its coming ad-supported tier too. And Peacock when it was preparing for its launch said its ad-supported tiers would have five minutes of ads per hour.

Traditional TV networks' ad load can reach up to 15 minutes an hour.

Can I skip or fast-forward through ads?

No. You can pause during an ad break but you can't skip or fast-forward through advertising on Netflix.

Is the complete Netflix library available on the Basic with Ads plan?

No. The ad-supported tier doesn't necessarily paywall any parts of the catalog but a ""limited"" number of titles won't be available to watch because of licensing restrictions Netflix said. The amount of titles locked out from ads-supported members is roughly 5% to 10% of the library varying by country according to the company.

Can I download to watch offline with Basic with Ads?

No. Basic with Ads membership cannot download to watch offline at all.

Will children be served ads on the new plan?

If they watch on a Kids profile they won't -- Kids profiles won't run any advertising.

What are the different prices for Basic with Ads in each country?

The monthly price for Basic with Ads varies depending on where you live:

Australia: AU$7 a month

Brazil: 18.90 reals a month

Canada: CA$6 a month

France: 6 euros a month

Germany: 5 euros a month

Italy: 5.50 euros a month

Japan: 790 yen a month

Mexico: 99 pesos a month

South Korea: 5500 won a month

Spain: 5.50 euros a month

UK: £5 a month

The $6.99 tier launched on Thursday in the U.S. and eight other countries with hundreds of brands on-board.

Among the brands that are advertising on Netflix on day one are somewhat surprisingly a number of luxury brands. LVMH brands including Louis Vuitton Tiffany & Co. and Bulgari were all spotted by Glossy on Netflix on the first day.

Dubbed ""Netflix at The Grove""—fittingly considering the retail stop’s location at The Grove shopping center in LA—the destination is an entertainment buff’s (or the Secret Santa of a Netflix enthusiast’s) paradise.

Open now through Jan. 6 2023 guests of all ages can expect a range of limited-edition items and apparel from Netflix’s most popular titles including Stranger Things Bridgerton and Squid Game plus children-centric series like Gabby’s Dollhouse Cocomelon and Ada Twist just to name a few. “As soon as guests enter the store they are fully transported into the world of Netflix” Greg Lombardo Netflix’s head of live experiences told BizBash.

“They will walk through the iconic streams [and] right into their favorite stories” he added referencing a corner of the 10000-square-foot space that’s home to an oversized Young-Hee doll which wreaked havoc on Squid Game but serves as a fun photo op complete with eyes that light up red.

And if futuristic horror fictions aren’t for you step back in time to Regency-era London. To cater to the Bridgerton fans Queen Charlotte’s throne and “unique costumes directly from the show” are on-site. The store is also selling Inside Bridgeton a behind-the-scenes story authored by the romance period drama’s creator Shonda Rhimes.

After seeing global success with immersive experiences such as ""The Queen’s Ball: A Bridgerton Experience"" ""Money Heist: The Experience"" and ""Stranger Things: The Store"" Lombardo said that it was time for a multi-title to-do which just so happened to be a “great opportunity to seamlessly blend that with the perfect shopping opportunity for the holidays” he said.

However the push to get the pop-up shop open by gift-shopping season was no easy feat. Lombardo pointed to the timeline as the biggest challenge adding that the turnaround time was an “impressive” one.

And he's not done. Come early December Netflix at The Grove will ""will open a secondary floor bursting with holiday spirit where fans can continue to step into their favorite movies and shows"" Lombardo said. The experiential expert also teased that the ""new immersive elements and photo vignettes"" will nod to shows like Slumberland Matilda Emily in Paris The Great British Baking Show: Holidays and many more.

On first meeting him he comes across as an easy-going friendly guy who you would just love to hang out with. But have a conversation with him and you will discover an incredibly deep man with a great depth of knowledge and desire to bring equality and inclusion into the world.

Alex Okyere has been the man at the helm of affairs at MultiChoice Ghana from 1 June 2021 with the task to further grow the business taking it to the next level. From all indications things are moving along very welleven in the face of the economic difficulties Ghana is currently facing.

He oversees some 400-plus staff at Multichoice Ghana a company that has made a major impacts in the media and communication industry of Ghana for close to 30 years. However Alex is not daunted by that task and is instead ready to get down in the trenches and make sure he leaves an imprint.

This is not surprising considering the vast experience he has garnered over the years from working with some big-name organisations.

With a background in Accounting Alex’s career started with accounting firm Ernst & Young – considered one of the top 4 firms globally taking him through PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC); mining firm Newmont oil companies Schlumberger and Weatherford and finally to MultiChoice.

While in Level 300 at the University of Ghana Business School Legon he had already become a Chartered Accountant having aced his ACCA. With a strong interest in working with PwC which at the time was considered the best accounting firm he applied for the company’s Graduate Recruitment programme before completing his first degree.

Ernst & Young came calling and just two months after he leaving university he joined them. But when PwC got in touch with him three months into his employment with Ernst & Young telling him he had made the cut for graduate employment the lure was too strong to resist and he left to work there.

He spent about three years at PwC before he moved on to Newmont. “Normally when you work in a Big 4 firm you have two choices with your career path; you either stay to become a Partner or you move into industry after gaining valuable experience from the Big 4 firm.

“And that is a big decision which you need to get right so in my third year with PwC I got an offer from Newmont. The Regional Financial Controller then spoke to me personally at the time. They were looking for a certain skill-set that was scarce. At that time the USA had passed a law known as the Sarbanes–Oxley Act 2002 which brought certain requirements in terms of internal controls for companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange so all their subsidiaries had to comply.

“Fortunately during my time with PwC I had been auditing such companies so I got exposure to the Act and those who had done it at the time were few. So although I had just about three years’ experience and the role – which was a managerial one – required about 7 years’ experience I got the job” he disclosed.

Alex describes the experience at Newmont as a good one with his then-boss Walter Richards becoming a mentor to him: buying him books encouraging him and just making sure he did not regret his stay with the company.

His boss eventually had to leave for another role and just around that time Alex got a call giving him another opportunity.

“Till today I still don’t know how the person got my number; but I got a call from London about a role at Schlumberger in Nigeria and the person inquired if I wanted to take it. And of course I said ‘yes’.”

At the time the offer came he had been married for just a few years and had a very young family. Tthere were concerns from his family about his safety considering some of the things they had heard about Nigeria.

However there was no way he was going to refuse such a big offer – especially when he was going to be an expatriate; the opportunities were endless.

“I think that was also a major turning point; going to Nigeria was heavenly. I didn’t witness all the bad things they were saying about Lagos. I got a lot of experience and it was great. It turned out to be as Samson said in Judges 14:14 – ‘Out of the eater something to eat; Out of the strong something sweet’.”

While working in Nigeria he got an offer to work with another oil firm Weatherford where he oversaw West Africa including Ghana.

MultiChoice Journey

As there is no place like home Alex started to get homesick wanting to return to Ghana – and MultiChoice offered him the perfect chance to do so.

He returned to Ghana in 2017 and at the time MultiChoice was looking for a Regional Finance Director with the office based in Accra. After a restructuring the office was moved to Nairobi in Kenya and he relocated with his family in 2018.

While in Kenya there was another opportunity to return to Ghana in the Managing Director role and he took it last year. While it was out of his comfort zone just as in everything else Alex put a positive spin on it – motivating himself that since he had done great in finance he could succeed in this role too.

The biggest challenge for Alex coming into the role was how to fix operational issues facing the company. “When I first took on the role I was made to understand that the biggest problem was sales and GOtv. Sales go with marketing so I needed to give it attention; and there were some people-issues as well.

“When I came in I spent 80 percent of my time on sales; I had sleepless nights because even when I was sleeping I would be thinking about the problem. Sometimes I had to come to the office at 4am; I was always the first person to get to the office because I had to do presentations to my bosses in Dubai.

“The first few months I spent a lot of time on sales work-shopping finding out what was wrong and what we could do better. Related to this was marketing – because if you don’t have proper marketing communication you can’t excel.

“So the sales operation needed to be fixed… but also marketing. We did some people-changes we changed incentives re-demarcated the sales regions with scientific data backing the demarcations among other measures and I think we’ve come far” he revealed.

Today all those changes are paying off and for Alex that’s a high point for him. “Our sales and marketing efforts are paying off and feed into our subscriber numbers. The business has grown significantly recording the biggest-ever monthly growth in the business’s history in August 2022 – with all-time highest subscriber numbers in Oct 2022” he stated.

Humble Beginnings

Alex Okyere describes himself as a man from humble beginnings; one who has seen quite a lot in life and is trying to build something for himself.

He was born at Asamankese in the Eastern Region to a farmer father and trader mother. He had his basic education at Asamankese where his love for accounting was nurtured by his Junior Secondary School headmaster.

“Back then I was among the best students in my school coming first several times. And I had a headmaster who noticed I was good with business math and encouraged me to study accounting.

“At the time I didn’t even know what accounting was but it seemed interesting to me. So when we were choosing courses for secondary school I chose Business and nothing else” he disclosed.

Having spent a lot of time with his aunt and older sisters in Kumasi Alex chose Prempeh College for his secondary school but did not get admission. He however got into Kumasi High School where with his aggregate 6 he was encouraged to pursue Science; but he insisted on studying Business.

For Alex that shift to Kumasi High School was a blessing in disguise because the school was the best in Business for the region. His first semester results in accounting (95 out of 100) convinced the school’s authorities to give him a scholarship for the duration of his stay in the school.

Not only that but his love for music was also nurtured there – joining the school choir known as Shalom Singers by courtesy of his school-father who was the music director. He understudied the person who played the keyboard and soon he was perfect at it – even playing for churches outside the school.

It was also at the school that he met a man who would become his mentor and spiritual father; his English teacher the Reverend Simon Ampofo who was a pastor at Harvest Chapel Kumasi and took him to the church where he played the keyboard; and he also became a member.

To date Alex consults him when he needs to make any major decisions concerning his life.

After secondary school he proceeded to the University of Ghana Legon where he obtained a Bachelor of Science in Administration. There too he became music director of the Chosen Vessels Choir (CVC).

Married with three kids he has a strong love for football and his favorite teams are Accra Hearts of Oak and Chelsea; and he also loves music and travelling.

He is currently a member of the Ghana CEOs Network the Association of South African businesses in Ghana and the Association of French Businesses in Ghana. He is also a Fellow of both the ACCA and ICA Ghana.

On his long-term vision for MultiChoice Ghana Alex had this to say: “I believe we have the potential to be the biggest within the region we find ourselves. Although Ghana has very strong Free to Air channels I believe we can crack that and become the biggest in our region. That is something I hope I can do with my team.”

On a personal level Alex has just one dream – to help alleviate poverty in Ghana. “I know it is difficult but it is something that is dear to my heart and I hope to be able to make a significant contribution to it” he concluded.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The main insight is that journalism is not and never has been the purpose of News Corporation. Its purpose its reason for existence is to provide the means by which three generations of the Murdoch family accumulate wealth and exert power.

In her magisterial history of Australian newspaper empires Paper Emperors Sally Young tells what she calls the real story of the birth of News Limited.

The company’s own creation myth is that its first newspaper the Adelaide News was the work of a couple of rugged individuals a “miner” called Gerald Mussen who was in fact an industrial consultant to Broken Hill Associated Smelters and a former editor of the Melbourne Herald J. E. Davidson.

As Young makes clear these two had long worked as collaborating propagandists for the Herald and Weekly Times of which Keith Murdoch was managing director and its associated mining interests in Broken Hill and Port Pirie. The evidence indicates that Mussen and Davidson were financed into the newspaper start-up by these interests for the purpose of continuing the propagandising.

Keith Murdoch later acquired the paper in his own right and bequeathed it to Rupert.

Propagandising was News’s original sin and it has never been redeemed. Instead it has broadened out to beat-ups misinformation disinformation and conspiracy theories.

Of course along the way it has done plenty of journalism some of it very high quality. In 1959 the Adelaide News under the editorship of Rohan Rivett played a large role in securing a judicial review of the Rupert Max Stuart case. Stuart had been sentenced to hang for the rape and murder of a nine-year-old girl after a trial that caused much public disquiet. His conviction was never conclusively overturned but he was released after 14 years in prison.

More recently Hedley Thomas’s exposés of the wrong done to Dr Mohamed Haneef and the inadequacies of the police investigation into the murder of Lynette Dawson for which her husband Chris was recently convicted have been instances of public-interest journalism at its best.

However this function of doing journalism – the “what” – is to be distinguished from the “why”. The journalism is done in pursuit of the organisation’s primary purpose the empowerment and enrichment of the Murdochs while every now and again also serving the public interest.

The coverage of Daniel Andrews needs to be seen in this light.

The starting point is that the Murdochs – Lachlan or Rupert or both – clearly prefer a non-Labor government and the continuance in office of a Labor administration in Victoria is an offence against their wishes.

So we saw in the 2018 election campaign a racist scare campaign against so-called African gangs pushed along by Peter Dutton now leader of the Liberal-National opposition in federal parliament and turbo-charged by the Herald Sun.

It backfired spectacularly and Andrews won in a landslide. That simply aggravated the offence.

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic the Herald Sun promoted increasingly shrill criticisms of the Andrews lockdowns particularly by the former Liberal federal treasurer Josh Frydenberg who subsequently lost his Melbourne seat of Kooyong in the May federal election. More aggravation.

Most recently on November 4 22 days before the 2022 Victorian state election there was yet further offence. Newspoll showed the Liberal Party trailing Labor 46-54% in two-party-preferred terms. Landslide territory again.

This succession of rebuffs shows that the capacity of the Murdoch media to influence electoral outcomes is weaker than it once was adding insult to injury.

Time for some mud-chucking in the hope that enough will stick.

First the Herald Sun resurrects a nine-year-old motor accident involving not Andrews himself but his wife. It publishes online a video-taped interview with the cyclist involved in the collision and his father.

The interview is long on innuendo and short on facts. It is insinuated that in some undefined way Andrews improperly used his power to deny the young man justice and that the legal system let him down.

Time too to resurrect a conspiracy theory.

On March 9 2021 Andrews slipped on some outside stairs at a holiday house he and his family had rented on the Mornington Peninsula injuring his back and ribs.

As The Guardian has reported an anonymous post about what had allegedly “really” happened appeared first on an encrypted messaging app favoured by far-right activists and conspiracy theorists then moved to a fringe website promoting QAnon and Port Arthur massacre misinformation.

The conspiracy theory asserted that Andrews’ injuries had been sustained in dark circumstances.

For reasons best known to herself the Liberals’ then Shadow Treasurer Louise Staley decided this was a fire worth throwing fuel on so she published a list of 12 questions she said Andrews needed to answer about the incident.

The list was predicated on so much misinformation and disinformation that Ambulance Victoria whose crew had taken Andrews to hospital and the chief commissioner of police both felt it necessary to issue statements setting out the facts.

This had the effect of killing off the conspiracy theory and when Matthew Guy took over as leader of the Liberal Party a few months later he demoted Staley to shadow minister for scrutiny of government.

Yet on November 6 the Sunday Herald Sun devoted many hundreds of words to a rehash of the conspiracy theory. This time it included a photograph of the steps noting that the house had been repainted since the incident. What might have been covered up by a fresh coat of paint the reader is implicitly invited to ask.

News Corporation is cradled in conflict of interest overt and covert influence-peddling and propaganda all for the purpose of advancing the Murdoch family’s interests. Abuse of media power is baked into its culture.

This does not excuse what the Herald Sun is doing but helps explain it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFjaHJuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy8xNDcyNDUtZGl2ZXJzaXRlY2gtY29ycC1hY3F1aXJlcy1hcnRpcGxhc3RpYy1jYXN0ZWwtZW5naW5lZXJpbmctYW5kLXJvZGlnYXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DiversiTech Corp.

As with many arbitration cases both sides claimed victory in the longstanding dispute. Under the ruling by New York’s Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (JAMS) Fox retained the right to purchase an 18.6% equity option in FanDuel Group for $3.72 billion with a 5% annual escalator. With the escalator the value of the option rose to $4.1 billion as of Nov. 4 Flutter wrote in a statement.

The option comes at a significantly higher price tag than the one initially sought by Fox. The arbitration tribunal determined that the option’s price is based on FanDuel’s fair market value of $20 billion as of December 2020 when Flutter announced the acquisition of Fastball’s 37.2% stake in FanDuel Flutter noted in the statement. U.K.-based Flutter one of the world’s largest gambling conglomerates is the parent company of FanDuel.

For purposes of the option FanDuel is now valued at $22 billion when the escalator is factored according to the JAMS ruling. The price is roughly double the $11.2 billion valuation for FanDuel estimated by Fox Corp. when the conglomerate filed a lawsuit against Flutter over the fair market value of the option.

Had the tribunal determined that the valuation is nearer the level sought by Fox the price of the equity option would have been closer to $2 billion.

The ruling “vindicates the confidence we had in our position on this matter and provides certainty on what it would cost FOX to buy into this business should they wish to do so” Flutter CEO Peter Jackson said in the statement.

Fox Corp. countered that Jeffries valued FanDuel at £25.3 billion ($35.1 billion) in 2021 translating to a strike price of nearly $6 billion for the option. The $6 billion price is considerably higher than the one determined by the arbitrator’s ruling. In further support of the ruling Fox will be seeking to confirm the award in federal court a company spokesperson said.

At a time when the intersection between major media networks and sports betting has reached a crossroads Friday’s ruling brings significant implications for both industries. While there had been some optimism in recent months that an accord between the mammoth companies could be reached a harmonious outcome now seems less feasible.

A path forward for Fox

Fox Corp. received an option to purchase up to 50% of The Stars Group’s (TSG) U.S. assets in a May 2019 deal struck roughly a year after the U.S. Supreme Court’s historic PASPA decision. Flutter’s subsequent purchase of TSG months later contained an option for Fox Corp. to acquire an 18.6% equity interest in FanDuel. The Stars Group’s U.S. division contains the operations of FOX Bet Pokerstars U.S. and FOX Bet Super 6 — a free-to-play contest.

Fox Corp. filed for arbitration in April 2021 on the fair value of the option. By last spring both companies appeared comfortable heading to arbitration if a settlement could not be reached by June. Under one scenario had the sides reached a comprehensive settlement FOX Sports may have turned to FanDuel as an official sports betting partner. As with BetMGM‘s partnership with NBC’s Football Night In America a vast menu of sports betting integrations on FOX Sports FS1 and FS2 could lead to a meaningful spike in customer activations for a sportsbook partner.

But first the companies needed to agree on the value of the option. A settlement could not be reached and the parties entered arbitration.

Although the ruling is in the rear-view mirror there are still many unknowns stemming from the decision according to MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman. From a positive vein he envisions numerous natural opportunities for Flutter and Fox to work together to leverage each company’s strategic assets and strengths. To date Fox has used its top of the funnel linear TV assets driven by marquee sports rights to increase Super 6 participation to a base of more than six million users.

Fishman emphasized that for now the market is ignoring Fox’s growth prospects by failing to assign fair value to its assets. If a media or digital company is unable to make a play for its assets he believes there should be interest on the private equity side. Given the disparate forces under consideration the next several months should be interesting to say the least.

The demise of FOX Bet

The ruling however could spell the end of FOX Bet under its current incarnation. In the event that Fox does not exercise its option in relation to TSG both parties have a right to terminate their agreement in relation to FOX Bet in August 2023 according to Flutter. Should either party opt to do so it would result in the termination of FOX Bet Flutter added.

Jordan Bender an equities analyst with JMP Securities told Sports Handle on Monday that he fully expects the two sides to separate. Since its inception Flutter has poured little capital into FOX Bet a sportsbook that has attained less than 1% of U.S. market share nationwide.

“FOX Bet has no scale and I don’t see Flutter putting anything behind this brand with FanDuel the golden child in the industry” Bender told Sports Handle.

Other industry analysts agree. A decision by Flutter not to provide “commercially reasonable resources” to FOX Bet may lead to the closure of the online sports betting platform according to a Jeffries research note. Despite the marginal market share FOX Bet is still averaging EBITDA losses of around $70 million a year Jeffries’ analysts wrote.

Nevertheless Fox Corp. would likely retain the FOX Bet brand name under that scenario with Flutter receiving the rights to the Super 6 game and PokerStars U.S. according to Flutter.

Ahead of the ruling a proposal surfaced from Fox Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch last month to recombine Fox Corp. and News Corp. two entities that both operated under Murdoch’s ownership before a 2013 split. In leveraging Fox’s broad portfolio of sports broadcast rights with News Corp.’s sports betting ties in Australia sports wagering is viewed as an integral component of the proposal.

“There is definitely interest from the company to one day bundle its network into a sports betting platform” Bender said while cautioning that the network still lacks a robust sports betting tech platform. A platform though could be built or acquired he added if Fox decides to expand sports betting operations.

For this month’s FIFA 2022 World Cup Fox Super 6 is hosting a $1 million free-to-play bracket contest. FOX Sports owns the U.S. broadcast rights for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

Timing of possible FanDuel IPO

Another lingering consideration surrounds the possibility that Flutter will conduct an initial public offering (IPO) for FanDuel. The tribunal still needs to decide under what conditions Fox Corp. is entitled to participate in an IPO of FanDuel if one takes place. Flutter according to Fox cannot proceed with a potential IPO without approval from the arbitrator or a settlement between the two parties.

The arbitrator is expected to rule on a binding decision regarding the IPO by early 2023. Jeffries views the potential listing as a catalyst for Flutter.

Still market conditions are not favorable for Flutter to pursue an IPO in the near term. Over the last 12 months sports betting-related stocks are down sharply amid concerns on long-term profitability. DraftKings by comparison now has a market capitalization of around $5 billion after falling more than 70% over the last year.

The 10-year option under which Fox Corp. has the right to acquire the stake in FanDuel does not expire until 2030. Fox also owns approximately four million shares of Flutter.

“FOX is pleased with the fair and favorable outcome of the Flutter arbitration” the corporation said in a statement. “FOX has no obligation to commit capital towards this opportunity unless and until it exercises the option. This optionality over a meaningful equity stake in the market leading U.S. online sports betting operation confirms the tremendous value FOX has created as a first mover media partner in the U.S. sports betting landscape.”

Fox shares (ticker FOX) fell more than 2% on Monday to a session low of $27.08. Another Fox share class (ticker FOXA) fell approximately 3% to $28.88 dropping near its 52-week low.

Hussey who got his nickname due to his commitment and passion for the game of cricket follows from the late Shane Warne who flew the flag for KFC SuperCoach BBL for the first four seasons of the fantasy game.

A veteran of 79 Tests Hussey played BBL following his retirement from international cricket scoring 466 runs in 13 innings in 2015-16.

Hussey is also a passionate KFC SuperCoach player coming in the top 1000 in both the BBL and AFL forms of the fantasy game and last season shared his knowledge with subscribers as a specialist contributor. He will now bring his knowledge and expertise to lead the charge as the KFC SuperCoach ambassador.

“I’m excited to be taking on the role of ‘Mr SuperCoach’. I’ve always loved playing all forms of cricket and I’ve especially loved testing my skills in KFC SuperCoach BBL and having bragging rights over my mates” Hussey said.

“While it’s heartbreaking that our inaugural ambassador and my friend Shane Warne passed away in March I know he would have wanted the show to go on he loved BBL and he loved wearing the baggy green tracksuit.”

Hussey spearheads an editorial and marketing campaign for KFC SuperCoach BBL launching this week across News Corp Australia’s state-based and regional mastheads. The marketing campaign will run across television radio print digital and social media.

Michael Wilkins News Corp Australia’s managing director – News Sport Network said: “KFC SuperCoach is an integral part of our cricket offering and we’re proud to have Mr Cricket himself Mike Hussey batting for KFC SuperCoach BBL in 2022-23.

“His love of the game and own expertise in playing Australia’s best fantasy cricket game will bring a new level of analysis for the thousands of fans who play every year. We are all looking forward to him becoming Mr SuperCoach.”

Players of KFC SuperCoach BBL have the chance to win a $25000 major prize and winners of each round will be in the running to win $500.

Now in its fifth season KFC SuperCoach BBL will this year enable players to get weekly insights into Hussey’s team for every round as well as other changes to make taking part easier than ever. These include being able to use up to three trade boosts in any round player position and trade updates as well as customisable leagues.

The interview is long on innuendo and short on facts. It is insinuated that in some undefined way Andrews improperly used his power to deny the young man justice and that the legal system let him down.

Time too to resurrect a conspiracy theory.

On March 9 2021 Andrews slipped on some outside stairs at a holiday house he and his family had rented on the Mornington Peninsula injuring his back and ribs.

As The Guardian has reported an anonymous post about what had allegedly “really” happened appeared first on an encrypted messaging app favoured by far-right activists and conspiracy theorists then moved to a fringe website promoting QAnon and Port Arthur massacre misinformation.

The conspiracy theory asserted that Andrews’ injuries had been sustained in dark circumstances.

For reasons best known to herself the Liberals’ then Shadow Treasurer Louise Staley decided this was a fire worth throwing fuel on so she published a list of 12 questions she said Andrews needed to answer about the incident.

The list was predicated on so much misinformation and disinformation that Ambulance Victoria whose crew had taken Andrews to hospital and the chief commissioner of police both felt it necessary to issue statements setting out the facts.

This had the effect of killing off the conspiracy theory and when Matthew Guy took over as leader of the Liberal Party a few months later he demoted Staley to shadow minister for scrutiny of government.

Yet on November 6 the Sunday Herald Sun devoted many hundreds of words to a rehash of the conspiracy theory. This time it included a photograph of the steps noting that the house had been repainted since the incident. What might have been covered up by a fresh coat of paint the reader is implicitly invited to ask.

News Corporation is cradled in conflict of interest overt and covert influence-peddling and propaganda all for the purpose of advancing the Murdoch family’s interests. Abuse of media power is baked into its culture.

This does not excuse what the Herald Sun is doing but helps explain it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFjaHJuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy8xNDcyNDUtZGl2ZXJzaXRlY2gtY29ycC1hY3F1aXJlcy1hcnRpcGxhc3RpYy1jYXN0ZWwtZW5naW5lZXJpbmctYW5kLXJvZGlnYXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DiversiTech Corp.

Hussey who got his nickname due to his commitment and passion for the game of cricket follows from the late Shane Warne who flew the flag for KFC SuperCoach BBL for the first four seasons of the fantasy game.

A veteran of 79 Tests Hussey played BBL following his retirement from international cricket scoring 466 runs in 13 innings in 2015-16.

Hussey is also a passionate KFC SuperCoach player coming in the top 1000 in both the BBL and AFL forms of the fantasy game and last season shared his knowledge with subscribers as a specialist contributor. He will now bring his knowledge and expertise to lead the charge as the KFC SuperCoach ambassador.

“I’m excited to be taking on the role of ‘Mr SuperCoach’. I’ve always loved playing all forms of cricket and I’ve especially loved testing my skills in KFC SuperCoach BBL and having bragging rights over my mates” Hussey said.

“While it’s heartbreaking that our inaugural ambassador and my friend Shane Warne passed away in March I know he would have wanted the show to go on he loved BBL and he loved wearing the baggy green tracksuit.”

Hussey spearheads an editorial and marketing campaign for KFC SuperCoach BBL launching this week across News Corp Australia’s state-based and regional mastheads. The marketing campaign will run across television radio print digital and social media.

Michael Wilkins News Corp Australia’s managing director – News Sport Network said: “KFC SuperCoach is an integral part of our cricket offering and we’re proud to have Mr Cricket himself Mike Hussey batting for KFC SuperCoach BBL in 2022-23.

“His love of the game and own expertise in playing Australia’s best fantasy cricket game will bring a new level of analysis for the thousands of fans who play every year. We are all looking forward to him becoming Mr SuperCoach.”

Players of KFC SuperCoach BBL have the chance to win a $25000 major prize and winners of each round will be in the running to win $500.

Now in its fifth season KFC SuperCoach BBL will this year enable players to get weekly insights into Hussey’s team for every round as well as other changes to make taking part easier than ever. These include being able to use up to three trade boosts in any round player position and trade updates as well as customisable leagues.

Kaufman who handed out yellow “no solar” pins ahead of a public meeting Monday on the issue said he supported imposition by the Jackson County Commission of an 18-month moratorium on consideration of applications for utility-grade solar. Commissioners listened to a couple dozen people eager to share clashing perspectives but didn’t vote on a pause that would give them time to study zoning regulations applicable to solar projects.

“My own idea is this whole solar proposition probably doesn’t have long term viability” said Kaufman who viewed with skepticism the future of an energy sector so reliant for profitability on tax credits.

A majority of those speaking out in the Jackson County Courthouse were supportive of a temporary moratorium or an outright rejection of any solar proposal that would transform the aesthetic of a rural countryside depress residential property values and align the county to “unreliable green energy.” One critic suggested the commissioners would be wise to embrace a decade-long prohibition on solar farms in the county.

People in the crowd eager for approval of the solar project pointed to an influx of several hundred construction jobs expansion of the county’s property tax base and transition to a clean energy alternative.

“I’m okay with having solar” said Jackson County farmer Gary Watkins. “I’m definitely for it. We’re going to have to go to clean energy.”

Ed Kathrens chairman of the county commission said a vote on the moratorium related to accepting applications and permit requests for commercial solar projects would take place in a week or 10 days.

A subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources a Florida company with thousands of employees and annual revenue in the billions of dollars is working in Jackson County on environmental surveys and lease agreements for land suitable for hosting solar arrays transmission lines and substations. The company proposed a comparable project in Johnson and Douglas counties where officials in those counties approved regulations allowing construction of big solar farms.

NextEra became a known commodity in Kansas during the past two decades through investment of $2.9 billion in wind facilities in nine counties.

John Felitto project developer for NextEra’s solar endeavor in Jackson County said during remarks to the commission the company wouldn’t apply for a permit for the project until May 2024 or until the county approved new solar regulations.

“We hope that this provides plenty of time for the commission to be deliberate in its process of drafting detailed thoughtful regulations” Felitto said.

He said NextEra was drawn to Jackson County because of its ample solar resource land topography as well as proximity to transmission networks and electric demand. A solar development would provide steady income to landowners and millions of dollars in tax revenue to the county he said.

Once approved by the county government Felitto said a solar project could be built in 12 months to 18 months. The construction phase would include building roads and transporting erecting testing and commissioning solar panels. Power produced by the solar units would be moved to the Southwest Power Pool which includes Kansas and other states.

Tom Hoffman who owns 160 acres and had been approached by a NextEra subsidiary about leasing land said the company was interested in deploying a new style of solar array. He urged commissioners not to get caught up in the economic development whirlwind: “Let’s not be the guinea pig.”

David Anderson an electrician from Circleville said there was no reason for the county to pivot to a moratorium. The rulemaking process could be completed without such a long disruption he said.

“This is really about jobs and progress” Anderson said. “I’m sorry people are so upset.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbmFyeW1lZGlhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9jbGltYXRldGVjaC1maW5hbmNlL3doYXQtY2hhbGxlbmdlcy13aWxsLWNvbmZyb250LWRvZS1sb2FuLXByb2dyYW0tZm9yLWVuZXJneS1yZXRyb2ZpdHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What challenges will confront DOE loan program for energy retrofits?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.canarymedia.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/climatetech-finance/what-challenges-will-confront-doe-loan-program-for-energy-retrofits (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF18BF760>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbmFyeW1lZGlhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9jbGltYXRldGVjaC1maW5hbmNlL3doYXQtY2hhbGxlbmdlcy13aWxsLWNvbmZyb250LWRvZS1sb2FuLXByb2dyYW0tZm9yLWVuZXJneS1yZXRyb2ZpdHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vcG9saWN5LWFuZC1wb2xpdGljcy8yMzM5OTIxMC9lbGVjdGlvbnMtMjAyMi1jbGltYXRlLXN0YXRlLXJhY2Vz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why the midterm elections are important for climate change,"Some of the most consequential elections for climate change on Tuesday aren’t in the Senate. They’re for an Arizona regulatory body a Texas city council and the Ohio Supreme Court.

These offices play a key role in climate policy. Even the most optimistic economic modeling on the impacts of the Inflation Reduction Act estimates the law won’t get the country close to slashing climate emissions in half by 2030 (the bare minimum the US needs to do to keep global warming to under a disastrous 2 degrees Celsius) without a big boost from state and local governments. An October paper by Energy Innovation a climate modeling group notes that states will be “central actors” in implementing the Inflation Reduction Act and determining how much emissions will fall.

There’s no level of government that is untouched by climate change. Local officials have to grapple with the consequences of raging wildfires floods and grid failures. And down-ballot races for city councils or states are “often nail-biters” that “literally come down to dozens or hundreds of votes” said Whit Jones an organizer of the climate campaign group Lead Locally.

Here are some of the races that could end up mattering most for climate change.

A pivotal election for governor in Oregon

Governor races matter because they can make appointments to the regulatory bodies and set the direction of state climate goals. Although there are races in Arizona Nevada Wisconsin Georgia Maine Michigan New Mexico and Pennsylvania that will determine the course of climate policy one election arguably with the most at stake is Oregon.

Oregon’s climate goals depend on who is controlling the governor’s office. In March 2020 Gov. Kate Brown issued a Climate Action Plan that pledges 45 percent greenhouse gas cuts by 2035. The state’s agencies and governor-appointed commissions have been at work trying to implement these targets in transportation land-use and energy sectors ever since. They have also enacted a Clean Fuels Program that sells carbon credits to in-state producers and importers of oil diesel and gasoline to offset carbon emissions.

At the time of Brown’s order there was little reason to fear that a Republican governor would challenge the status quo. Democrats have comfortably controlled the Oregon governor’s office since the 1980s. But this cycle Republicans have an ally in Phil Knight Nike’s co-founder and richest man in the state who has funneled millions to the Republican candidate Christine Drazan and an unaffiliated candidate Betsy Johnson. Recent polls have shown Drazan with a narrow lead over Democratic candidate Tina Kotek. The unaffiliated candidate Johnson trails behind both of them but her presence as a former Democratic lawmaker in the race has helped to draw support away from Kotek.

Drazan already promises if she wins to reverse Oregon’s climate orders on day one and suspend the Clean Fuels Program. In 2020 Drazan even led a GOP walkout of the Democratic-controlled legislature that stopped a vote on climate legislation before it could come to a vote. Whoever wins will also hold the power to appoint positions that will help shape the state’s climate rules over the next four or more years.

State legislatures could gain supermajorities or flip

State legislatures can push forward climate policy or they can obstruct it. Multiple legislatures could change party control but contests in North Carolina and Minnesota are notable.

North Carolina General Assembly

In North Carolina Republicans are just a handful of seats away from a supermajority in both houses giving them the two-thirds margin they need to overturn any vetoes from the governor. Even with Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper in office until at least 2024 a supermajority GOP state legislature could deliver some serious setbacks to clean car and clean energy goals.

North Carolina is unique among Southeastern states because it has a plan to tackle climate change and advance clean energy. But implementing it will require the governor to appoint climate officials to statewide positions like the utility regulatory commission. A supermajority of Republicans in control makes it much more difficult to get any appointees through.

If Republicans gain just five seats then the state would also be the next to join the 20 others that have preemption laws blocking climate action by cities. Last year Cooper vetoed the preemption bill passed by the Republican-controlled legislature. Preemption bills aligned with the American Gas Association’s priorities forbid cities and municipalities from passing rules that transition buildings off of gas appliances. While there aren’t any North Carolina cities with rules on the books blocking gas yet — gas overall is less common to heat homes in the Southeast than cities like New York — residential demand has been growing over the past decade and preemption would limit cities’ options in the future.

Minnesota state Senate

Democrats control one chamber in Minnesota but are vying to gain control of the state Senate this cycle. If they do they’ll have a Democratic governor and a Democratic legislature with potentially enough votes to finally pass climate legislation. Democrats need to pick off just two seats from the Republican majority to flip the state Senate.

Minnesota’s governor has unrolled a climate plan to accelerate pollution cuts faster than the law the state already has on the books. Many of the priorities will require legislation to enact including new spending on public transit; boosting the number of electric vehicles on the road from under 1 percent to 20 percent by 2030; restoring forests grasslands and wetlands; and requiring all new commercial and multifamily buildings to hit a net-zero carbon target by 2036.

Utilities are well aware of the climate stakes of the state Senate too. According to tracking from Energy and Policy in one race utility interests from inside and outside the state including Xcel Energy the Edison Electric Institute Florida-based NextEra Energy and Florida Power and Light have lined up to support Republican candidate Kathleen Fowke the wife of a former Xcel chair against Democrat Kelly Morrison. (NextEra Energy is based in Florida but has wind projects in Minnesota; it’s the parent company of Florida Power and Light which has been swept up in scandals for opposing expanded rooftop solar policies.)

Local officials with a say over what gets built and how in Texas

Cities are major laboratories for climate policy and adaptation especially when it comes to what gets built or not in major hotspots for fossil fuel drilling. Cities can make progress on climate change even in a red state like Texas.

Harris County Texas judge

The Harris County judge is more like a CEO with broad jurisdictional power over the nation’s largest county in the Houston area home to sprawling oil and petrochemical industrial operations.

Lina Hidalgo is fighting to stay in her seat as county judge for Harris County after her surprise win in 2018.

Her opponent Alexandra del Moral Mealer has focused primarily on crime and law enforcement in her campaign in contrast to Hidalgo’s emphasis on her environmental priorities — including incorporating climate flood maps into city planning and hiring environmental prosecutors. Hidalgo’s expansion of the county’s pollution budget and air monitors has earned her a strong reputation among climate advocates including the endorsement of the down-ballot-focused PAC Climate Cabinet. Mealer for her part told the Houston Chronicle (which ultimately endorsed her) that climate change isn’t her priority. Mealer’s website says: “County is not the appropriate entity to solve Climate Change - let’s fix potholes first.” The race has been in a dead heat.

Corpus Christi Texas City Council

Another Texas race has huge stakes because of its geographic location. The Port of Corpus Christi — which gets most of its oil from the Permian Basin the most active oilfield in the US — has become the US’s No. 1 exporter of crude oil. The city council has a big say over what gets built and what oversight is in place in a state that’s otherwise overrun by oil industry interests. The climate group Lead Locally lists four endorsed candidates running for city council as part of a slate pledging to oppose a local desalination plant put more attention on preparing for climate change and increase focus on clean energy.

State treasurers can fight or encourage clean energy investments

A growing number of state treasurers have moved to pull any state investments from banks that “boycott fossil fuels” haphazardly identifying certain companies that have made public commitments on climate change and ESG (a framework for incorporating environmental social and corporate governance values into company strategy).

Even some fossil fuel companies have considered aligning with ESG standards but the growing anti-ESG movement has cherry-picked which companies they will divest from and the investment fund BlackRock has become a poster child for the backlash. Texas Florida Louisiana and West Virginia have all pulled or pledged to pull state pensions from BlackRock.

ESG has factored in the Arizona state treasurer race where incumbent Kimberly Yee (R) is up against Martin Quezada (D). Yee has vowed to ignore ESG standards going forward saying it’s “inappropriate for the investment room.” Quezada takes a different view that ESG isn’t about politics but about sensible investment decisions. “I think it’s really irresponsible of any manager or investor of public money to oppose any type of risk analysis for your investment strategy” he’s said.

An October 17 poll by the research firm OH Predictive Insights showed Yee holding a comfortable lead 46-35 over Quezada.

Contests that matter for legal cases

Attorneys general and the courts have played an increasingly high-profile role in climate fights throughout the country. At least seven attorneys general are in lawsuits against the oil industry for its role in creating climate pollution and spreading disinformation and are also locked in battles over the fate of fossil fuel infrastructure. More of these cases are going to hit state Supreme Courts several of which are elected directly by the people.

Ohio Supreme Court

The Ohio Supreme Court has been controlled by Republicans for decades but there are three seats open this cycle. The candidates who win will play an important role deciding the future of energy accountability and climate lawsuits in the state. The court has played a particularly pivotal part in the ongoing FirstEnergy bribery scandal where the company has paid $230 million in fines over bribing state politicians to protect the utility’s nuclear and coal investments.

The court will eventually decide a number of issues including whether ratepayers will recover up to $1.4 billion for the scandal. Another important issue the court will decide is who has the right to sue and block renewable energy permitting in the state. The nonprofit outlet Energy News Network has a more detailed rundown of the race which polling from late September by Spectrum News/Siena College showed to be about even.

Michigan attorney general

The fate of a 1950s-era liquid gas and crude oil pipeline may be up to who wins the attorney general seat in Michigan. Michigan’s incumbent AG Dana Nessel a Democrat has an ongoing complaint against the pipeline company Enbridge Energy over Line 5 which transports 22 million gallons of crude oil and natural gas liquids through Wisconsin and Michigan. Her lawsuit is trying to shut down the Michigan portion of the pipeline because of its role in dozens of spills and potential to wreak havoc on natural areas and tribal lands.

She’s up against Republican challenger Matthew DePerno who has promised that one of his first priorities will be to dismiss a legal fight with Enbridge over the Line 5 pipeline. DePerno rose to national prominence for claiming Donald Trump’s election loss in 2020 was fraudulent and is under state investigation himself for allegedly plotting to tamper with voting machines. Polling by WDIV/Detroit News in October has Nessel with a 12-point lead over DePerno.

State regulators can make sure utilities are hitting clean energy targets

Utility commissions can make or break a state’s climate goals. “They can approve or block the stuff that needs to get built to deliver a clean electrified future from renewable plants and batteries to transmission lines to electric-vehicle charging infrastructure” explained Julian Spector of Canary Media.

Governors appoint commissioners in 37 states and the state legislature appoints them in two. In the last 11 states commissioners have to run for election setting up a situation where the utility regulators can be surprisingly pro-climate in unexpectedly red territory.

Arizona Corporate Commission

This five-seat commission has two openings up for grabs. There are two Democrats Sandra Kennedy and Lauren Kuby running against two Republicans Nick Myers and Kevin Thompson. Most of Arizona’s statewide races have looked like toss-ups per polling.

If Democrats win they could flip the commission’s majority 3-2 creating a solid bloc of more ardent clean energy advocates to advance reforms. While the Republican candidates have argued for an all-of-the-above energy mix that maintains reliance on fossil (natural) gas the Democratic candidates argue the state’s overdependence on natural gas is a problem. “We replaced one dirty fossil fuel with another by switching from coal to natural gas and the recent spike in natural gas prices has hit Arizona ratepayers hard as a result” Kennedy told the Arizona Republic.

Louisiana Public Service Commission

Louisiana which voted overwhelmingly for Trump in 2020 doesn’t seem the likeliest climate battleground. But as the third-ranked state in gas production and home to a growing number of liquid natural gas terminals Louisiana has outsize influence beyond its borders. The state’s position on clean energy is especially important because it is part of the mid-continent system operator the biggest interstate grid operator by land that encompasses 15 states.

The Louisiana Public Service Commission which regulates utilities could become less deferential to the utility Entergy and more open to regional transmission projects for renewables depending on who wins the commission’s two open seats. “If one or both of these seats flips to someone — regardless of party — who is active on clean energy and climate you’re going to see a lot of movement from Louisiana” said Daniel Tait who has tracked these races for the utility watchdog Energy and Policy. Two of those utility-friendly incumbents Lambert Boissiere (D) and Mike Francis (R) are in reelection campaigns against challengers progressive favorite Gregory Manning and Republican Keith Bodin respectively.

Boissiere has had a comfortable lead but an Environmental Defense Fund-affiliated PAC has just entered the race with $500000 a huge sum for a down-ballot race to spend on ads against him.

Texas Railroad Commission

Climate activists also spent last cycle making a failed bid to gain control of the Texas Railroad Commission which is technically not a utility commission but an important environmental regulatory body in the state. Though he is considered an underdog Democratic candidate Luke Warford has made a bid for a seat on the commission by focusing on clean energy and climate issues. He’s focused on Texas’s overreliance on gas to power its grid which was one factor that led to massive blackouts in winter 2021.

“Texas is the largest greenhouse gas emitter in the country and Texas’ oil and gas industry is the largest contributor to those emissions” Warford wrote in a column for Data for Progress. “Put differently the Texas Railroad Commission regulates the industry that produces the most greenhouse gasses in the highest greenhouse-gas-emitting state in the country. And every year millions of tons of greenhouse gasses are emitted into the atmosphere because the Texas Railroad Commission fails to enforce existing regulations.”

The limited polling on the race conducted by KHOU/Texas Hispanic Policy Foundation in September found Warford trailing Republican incumbent Wayne Christian by at least 7 points.

Tri-Rail is operated by the South Florida Regional Transportation Authority.

By Dan Christensen FloridaBulldog.org

The governing board of the South Florida Regional Transportation Authority operator of Tri-Rail commuter service ditched staff plans to seek bids for lobbying services and instead rehired its longtime lobbyist amid apparent cronyism conflicts of interest and possibly wasteful spending.

The rehiring of lobbyist Candice Ericks vice president of TSE Consulting the lobbying arm of Fort Lauderdale’s Tripp Scott law firm occurred during the March SFRTA meeting. Among the SFRTA board members who voted to derail seeking bids and renew Ericks’s expiring $246000-a-year contract was Ericks’s own boss – Tripp Scott co-founder fellow TSE lobbyist and SFRTA vice chairman James (Jim) Scott.

The 16-month renewal is worth $328000.

The SFRTA’s lobbying contract is with Ericks Consultants whose president and principal owner is Candice’s father David Ericks. Candice Ericks the firm’s secretary-treasurer was out of the country and unavailable for Florida Bulldog comment.

Screenshot from TSE Consulting web site.

David Ericks has not been registered to lobby for SFRTA in Tallahassee since 2018. Lauren Jackson Candice Ericks’s government relations co-worker at TSE Consulting said David Ericks remains an “advisor on the contract.”

Jackson said neither TSE nor Tripp Scott received any money from the deal. “That is completely separate” Jackson said. “The Ericks Consultants contract has no financial benefit to or relationship with TSE.” She also noted that Ericks Consultants has represented the SFRTA since before its inception in 2003 “playing an instrumental role in passing its enacting legislation.”

Scott a former Republican president of the Florida Senate and Broward County commissioner not only voted to award the contract renewal to the woman who heads his law firm’s lobbying division he actively participated in the board’s brief discussion about postponing bids.

“Without getting into a big discussion” Scott said according to a Zoom video recording of the meeting obtained by Florida Bulldog using Florida’s public records law “I just think that in view of what’s occurred here with our transit situation so to speak that it should be postponed at least for six months or a year.”

The video shows that the renewal deal was done in less than five minutes in the middle of the lengthy meeting. (Video of that discussion begins at 5:00.)

Scott’s vote and participation were in apparent violation of both state law and the SFRTA’s ethics policy which states “No officer shall vote in an official capacity upon any measure which would inure to his or her special private gain or loss; which he or she knows would inure to the special private gain or loss of any principal by which he or she is retained…or which he or she knows would inure to the special private gain or loss of a relative or business associate of the officer.” (emphasis added)

Scott 80 also failed to publicly disclose his business relationship with Ericks whom he hired in 2017.

Both Florida law and the authority’s ethics policy require board members to announce any conflicts and abstain from voting. Prior to any vote they must also “publicly state to the assembly the nature of the officer’s interest in the matter from which he or she is abstaining.” Further members who abstain “shall not participate in any Board or Committee discussion of the matter” and likewise “shall not discuss the matter with SFRTA staff or consultants.”

Scott did not respond to Florida Bulldog phone and email messages seeking comment.

ERICKS CONTRACT RENEWAL DONE SECRETIVELY

The SFRTA is a state agency that owns and operates the Tri-Rail transit system in Miami-Dade Broward and Palm Beach counties. Its operating budget for 2022-2023 is $139.3 million. Its capital budget is an additional $72.6 million. Its governing board has 10 members of which three are appointed by the governor.

Robert Sendler

Scott was appointed to the board by Gov. Ron DeSantis in January 2021. Also appointed by DeSantis the same day was Florida Power & Light attorney Robert Sendler who was to play a key role in Ericks’s contract renewal.

The SFRTA renewed Ericks’s lobbying contract in near complete secrecy. There was no advance public notice of the contract renewal vote. It isn’t mentioned on SFRTA’s list of solicitations and notices of awards. Nor was the renewal on the authority’s March 25 meeting agenda. It arose only after then-Executive Director Stephen Abrams announced to the board that “now that the regular legislative session is over” staff would be seeking bids for the authority’s state lobbying contract. Ericks’s five-year $1.23-million contract was expiring the following month.

“It’s not like there aren’t a whole bunch of lobbying firms that can’t do this work and probably for a lot cheaper – and better because Ericks hasn’t gotten a dime more money for Tri-Rail from FDOT [Florida Department of Transportation] or the Legislature which needs it desperately” said one SFRTA staffer.

Indeed SFRTA has for years said it needs a dedicated funding source of $50 million a year “to provide the regional transit projects South Florida’s public has requested.” A funding source has yet to be secured.

FPL LAWYER HELPS FPL LOBBYIST

But the plans of Abrams and his staff to put the SFRTA’s lobbying contract out for bids for the first time in nearly seven years quickly went out the window.

Without any discussion as to the merits of renewing Ericks’s contract Scott’s fellow board member Robert Sendler immediately brought up the idea of extending it for a year. It is noteworthy that until he retired in June Sendler was a vice president and chief litigation counsel for NextEra Energy Resources a subsidiary of FPL parent NextEra Energy.

Ericks is a registered lobbyist for FPL. So is lobbyist Nick Iarossi an owner of Tallahassee’s Capital City Consulting which also has a piece of the SFRTA’s contract with Ericks Consulting via the lobbying work of partner Jim Boxold a former secretary of the Florida Department of Transportation.

SFRTS board members James Scott right and Robert C.L. Vaughn shortly before they cast their votes to extend the Ericks contract for one year.

With Ericks in the room Sendler asked whether she had been “contacted” to see if she’d be “interested” in a one-year extension on the same terms and conditions. Sendler explained that because SFRTA was in the middle of various changes including getting a new executive director “I would love to have my lobbying entity be selected by my new executive director…so that they would be kind of be you know in synch with each other.”

Next Scott chimed in in support of postponing the bid. Someone asked Ericks if she’d agree to the bid postponement and renewal of her lucrative contract. “Yes we would be amenable to it 100 percent” Ericks replied.

The one-year deal was done unanimously.

“They were the two board members who pushed it through – and didn’t want to hear any discussion about it” said the SFRTA staffer. “This all stinks and just goes to show what happens on these obscure boards with big budgets and too little media scrutiny. Sendler and Scott are both appointments to the SFRTA board by Governor DeSantis. I wonder how the governor’s office feels about all this favoritism and self-dealing by the governor’s appointees? He should kick them off!”

THE DEAL GETS BETTER

But the deal making wasn’t quite finished.

SFRTA Deputy Executive Director Diane Hernandez Del Calvo informing SFRTA Chair Maria Marino that the Ericks lobbying contract needed a further extension.

The video shows Deputy Executive Director Diane Hernandez Del Calvo quietly informing SFRTA chair Maria Marino a Palm Beach County commissioner that next year’s legislative session will happen “later.” Marino then asked for a new vote to extend the lobbying contract until after the session.

“I’m happy to accept that friendly amendment” said an obliging Sendler. He then moved to further extend the contract this time for an additional four months until Aug. 31 2023. Candice Ericks agreed. Done deal unanimously. The 16-month additional cost to SFRTA: $328000.

The Legislature’s regular session runs from March 7 to May 5 2023.

The SFRTA governing board members voting to approve the extensions: Scott Sendler Marino current chair Raquel Regalado Carlos Penin Hal Valeche Robert C.L. Vaughan and J.C. De Ona. Gerry O’Reilly and Tim Ryan had excused absences.

This was the fourth board-approved extension of the original five-year Ericks lobbying contract including one in May 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic which brought the total contract length to date of seven years and 11 months.

PIECES OF THE LOBBYING PIE

With previous amendments enhancing the original contract price of $1.23 million by $539500 the total cost has now swelled to $2097500 authority records show.

In contrast SFRTA has a five-year $720000 contract for federal legislative lobbying services with giant FTI Consulting. That contract will expire next year too.

While TSE Consulting apparently gets no cut from the contract other lobbying firms like Capital City Consulting do. In 2015 in an arrangement perhaps intended to minimize competition Ericks Consultants teamed with a trio of subcontractors: Fort Lauderdale’s The (William) Rubin Group West Palm Beach’s The (Don) Mathis Group and Miami-Dade’s The (Rodney) Barreto Group to bid on the SFRTA’s lobbying contract. Of the $246000 annual take Rubin got $96000 Barreto got $50000 and Mathis got $40000 records show. Ericks got the rest that year.

Ericks’s take home has grown significantly over the years. And the firm’s most recent compensation report filed Oct. 18 reveals that its contract with SFRTA accounts for most of its revenue or between $30000 and $40000 per quarter. (Florida only requires lobbying firms to report compensation within various ranges.)

And the subcontractors are getting less. From Jan. 1 2021 through June 30 2022 Mathis reported earning $60000 to $120000 as Ericks’s subcontractor. Capital City and Billy Rubin’s firm now called Rubin Turnbull & Associates reported their quarterly earnings from SFRTA as between $1 and $9999.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMTEvMDYvdW5jb25kaXRpb25hbC1mcmllbmQtbWVldC10aGUtbWFuLXNoYWRvd2luZy1tYW5jaGluLTAwMDY1MTY30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Unconditional friend': Meet the man shadowing Manchin,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/06/unconditional-friend-meet-the-man-shadowing-manchin-00065167 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMTEvMDYvdW5jb25kaXRpb25hbC1mcmllbmQtbWVldC10aGUtbWFuLXNoYWRvd2luZy1tYW5jaGluLTAwMDY1MTY30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

A glut of sneakers and sports clothing has built up in recent months leading to concerns that Nike will have to heavily mark down prices on shoes and sportswear if it wants to sell them during the competitive holiday season. That has taken a toll on its stock which has fallen 41 percent in the past year.

Then on Thursday one of the superstar athletes with whom Nike partners Kyrie Irving was suspended by the Nets after he posted a link to an antisemitic film on social media.

A day later Nike suspended its relationship with the basketball star and said it would not release Mr. Irving’s new shoe the Kyrie 8 which was supposed to hit the market on Tuesday. Nike has produced the shoe since 2014. The company does not disclose exactly how much revenue Mr. Irving’s shoes bring in but it is only a fraction of what the company earns from its ties to other notable stars especially the basketball great Michael Jordan.

“There are some things that are outside of Nike’s control” like supply chain and sourcing issues that are not so easily fixed said David Swartz an equity analyst at Morningstar. “This Kyrie Irving situation was in Nike’s control. They can drop him.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9mYW5uYXRpb24vc25lYWtlcnMvbmV3cy9uaWtlLWFza3Mtc3RvcmVzLXRvLXJlbW92ZS1reXJpZS1pcnZpbmdzLW5ldy1zaG9lc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike Kyrie 8 Pulled from Store Shelves,"Three days ago the Brooklyn Nets suspended Kyrie Irving indefinitely for social media posts and rhetoric deemed antisemitic. Later that day Nike suspended its relationship with Irving and canceled the launch of his ninth signature shoe.

Following the major news we wrote a complete breakdown of the situation. Irving debuted the Nike Kyrie 8 this summer and wore it during the 2022-23 NBA season. Now Sole Savy reports that Nike has emailed retailers asking them to remove the unreleased shoes from their store shelves.

Reported email sent from Nike to retailers. Atatf

The email above states ""Effective immediately stores are to pull all Kyrie 8 models from sales floor and place in their back room. Stores are not to sell any Kyrie 8 product until further notice.""

However the email does indicate that all other Kyrie products can continue to be sold until further notice. So the Nike Kyrie Infinity Nike Kyrie Low 5 and apparel from previous collections can still remain in stores.

The email lists multiple Nike Kyrie 8 colorways that were scheduled for release. In August Irving hinted at a launch date of November 11 2022. Due to the controversies Nike never released official images tech specs or pricing for the Nike Kyrie 8.

Nike will never launch Irving's ninth signature shoe. However images of the unreleased model have circulated online for several months. Above is an image of the Nike Kyrie 8 'Multi' which was scheduled to be one of the first colorways sold.

Irving is still serving his suspension so it remains to be seen if he will still wear Nike basketball shoes whenever he plays again. Stay locked into FanNationKicks.com for news analysis and interviews.

Nike alums lead numerous brands including Lululemon Allbirds Columbia Sportswear and The North Face.

""What you learn at Nike isn't taught in school"" Jana Panfilio a 29-year Nike veteran said.

Nike insiders worry about the loss of executive talent.

Wall Street analysts gathered near Beaverton Oregon in October for a splashy investor-day event. Music videos blared as executives with decades of experience at Nike took the stage. The latest sportswear products lined the walls of the auditorium.

But it wasn't a Nike event. It was part of the first investor day for Columbia Sportswear which happens to have its global headquarters across an interstate highway from Nike's corporate campus.

Three of the 11 speakers at the Columbia event — Tim Sheerin Pri Shumate and Craig Zanon — worked a combined 44 years at Nike. Each joined Columbia within the past three years.

A month earlier VF Corp. a sportswear giant and the parent company of The North Face hosted an investor day. Among the speakers was Nicole Otto who worked 16 years for Nike most recently running the company's direct-to-consumer business in North America before she became president of VF's North Face brand in May. About that time The North Face announced a new chief marketing officer and a new chief product and merchandising officer. Both came from Nike.

Nike executives are regularly being named to positions atop the organizational charts of other consumer brands in sportswear and beyond. The moves take place two years after a sweeping reorganization and as Nike continues to work through a digital transformation under CEO John Donahoe. Analysts and insiders say the trend is a reflection of the demand for Nike talent but they worry about the loss of institutional knowledge at Nike especially to companies competing for the same buyers and shelf space.

""Nike simply breeds leaders and the industry knows that"" Ashley Comeaux told Insider.

Comeaux became the vice president of product design for Allbirds after spending more than a decade at Nike in various roles which she described as an ""Ivy League education"" in product creation.

""It wasn't until I left that I was fully able to absorb and appreciate what I'd learned in design and product"" she said. ""I have an incredible toolbox of transferable skills.""

When Nike executives want to take those transferable skills to their next gig many look to 6453 Alumni a nonprofit group with roughly 400 members. The group helps alums stay connected find their next job or even start their own company. (The digits 6453 spell ""Nike"" on a phone dial.)

""What you learn at Nike isn't taught in school"" Jana Panfilio a 29-year Nike veteran and cofounder of the group said. ""From deep understanding of consumers to marketplace execution and everything in between Nike has long been the industry standard for delivering uncompromising excellence.""

Nike wasn't always considered a launchpad for corporate leaders. Nike cofounder Phil Knight lamented that fact in a 1986 shareholder letter when he said ""we have some management problems"" and referenced some bad press coverage of ""swoosh management.""

The days of corporate America looking sideways at Nike are long gone.







Nike is now the dominant sportswear company with annual revenue 46% higher than its closest rival Adidas. It's part of the Dow Jones index of blue-chip companies and regularly named a top employer. One job applicant went so far as to print her résumé on a cake to get an interview.

The allure of Nike lasts long after executives leave the company.

'The brand opened up the doors quickly'

In 2016 Under Armour opened a footwear office in Nike's hometown and staffed it with several Nike alums. The trend has accelerated in recent years with competing sportswear companies including Lululemon and Allbirds opening offices in Portland Oregon. Each company hired from Nike.

Lululemon whose chief brand officer Nikki Neuburger spent over a decade at Nike launched a footwear line earlier this year. Neuburger's last position at Nike was vice president of global brand marketing in the company's running department.

""For me it's the brand"" Rob Barnett a headhunter a corporate recruiter and the CEO of Rob Barnett Media said. ""A lot of my job is about positioning people who have the most credibility and the most success that they can possibly present. There are certain companies like Nike that give you a strong calling card.""

Barnett recently helped a company fill an open executive position with a Nike veteran.

In recent years the Nike cache has been touted in numerous press releases.

Nike executives who have found their way to Columbia North Face and Deckers have been touted in press releases as ""consumer-obsessed"" innovators and ""future-focused"" leaders and having the ability to create and transform ""merchandising functions across categories channels and markets.""

While sportswear companies are a natural fit for former Nike executives nonathleticwear companies also have hired from Nike's top ranks. Google Target and Amazon have Nike alumni working in top roles in branding marketing communication design and sustainability.

Last year Lisa Wynn joined Google as its head of internal communications. Byron Merritt joined Amazon as its vice president of design for Amazon Music.

Maserati CEO David Grasso is a Nike alum as is the company's chief marketing officer.

Rumors even bounced around Hollywood this summer that Mark Parker Nike's chair and former CEO could be the next CEO of Disney though an insider dismissed the speculation as ""just not true."" Parker sits on Disney's board.

Lululemon launched a footwear line earlier this year. The sportswear company has poached a handful of execs from Nike. Lululemon

'Not everybody can climb all the way up the ladder at Nike'

One reason Nike employees are leaving is insiders said the reorganization Donahoe instituted early in his tenure resulted in fewer middle-management roles and fewer opportunities for advancement. Insiders also said the company's org chart which the company describes as a matrix needed to be simplified.

""Given how big and successful Nike has been I think it's natural for other companies to look at Nike when scouting out talent"" Tom Nikic a Wedbush Securities analyst said. ""Plus not everybody can climb all the way up the ladder at Nike so at some point some of these execs likely feel like they've hit their ceiling at Nike and need to look outside of Beaverton for their next big opportunity.""

Others said there's diminished loyalty and lingering frustration because of how layoffs were executed during the reorganization.

""There's a lot of institutional knowledge that has either walked out the door of its own volition or been shown the door"" a former employee said.

Other reasons for departures: Competitors pay more COVID-19 forced people to reevaluate priorities and the company has a stubborn work-from-home policy. Nike also tends to hire hypercompetitive people who want to move up and jump at opportunities to prove themselves at new companies.

Nikic said Nike executives had good track records at their new jobs noting the recent success of Deckers the maker of Hoka under CEO Dave Powers a former vice president of Nike's Converse brand. Crocs which named the former Nike vice president Emma Minto the senior vice president of the Americas in 2020 also has been on a hot streak. (Minto recently left Crocs according to her LinkedIn profile.)

Nike hasn't commented on its executive turnover but it's gone through similar periods.

In the same shareholder letter in which Knight criticized characterizations of Nike's management he said the company was coming out of a period of high turnover. But he put a positive spin on it.

""We have been raising a new group of company leaders"" Knight wrote.

Since then Nike's revenue has climbed more than 4000%.

$40k of dental expenses could wipe the smile off of anyone’s face. My friend Nok Nike has a rare double set of teeth. She discovered this after months of chronic headaches. Her dental problem has become a serious medical problem requiring a series of surgeries as well as soft tissue grafts and bone grafts. In Indonesia Nike started a treatment that did not go well. 6 months ago she received a US work visa and relocated here. As you probably know Nike’s dental insurance will not pay for the two-year course of oral surgeries. Although she can pay all of her normal life expenses the dental surgery expenses are far from normal. Please consider pitching in to help repair and restore Nike’s smile and oral health.





Here is Nike with her cat Zion. And here is an x-ray of her double set of teeth.









HOW I WAS LUCKY TO MEET NIKE 3 YEARS AGO IN INDONESIA





In 2019 I met Nike when I tried to recruit her to work at “Ashoka – Everyone a Changemaker” the international NGO that created the field of social entrepreneurship. Nike had recently returned to Indonesia after earning her MBA at Babson College in Massachusetts. She had job offers to work in private industry and also for the Indonesian government. However Nike felt a calling to use her talents differently. She wanted to improve Indonesia and the world by helping growing numbers of people to use their talents to solve humanity’s most pressing social problems.





Ashoka was looking for talent and Nike had a lot of it. Despite growing up poor in a rural area of Java as a young girl Nike showed extraordinary mathematical talent. She started winning math competitions and became somewhat of a local celebrity. By combining her math talent with entrepreneurial drive Nike created a tutoring business a catering business and an organic farming initiative in college.





This is exactly the kind of “changemaker” talent Ashoka works to celebrate foster and unleash. Nike agreed to join Ashoka in Indonesia in the role of regional recruiter of senior talent. We became friends by working together at Ashoka.













Below you’ll read more of Nike’s story in her own words. You’ll see examples of her compassion combined with entrepreneurial skill. You’ll also learn that the true cost of the oral surgeries Nike needs is more than $100000. But $40000 in generous support could suffice to heal her because she has been offered discounted care through a generous oral surgeon whom she met through kind US friends.





Nok Nike’s Story In Her Own Words





My name is Nike and I need your help. I suffer from a painful debilitating condition that affects every aspect of my life and will become part of daily suffering for the rest of my life if not addressed quickly. I had hyperdontia extra teeth pressing on my facial nerve. After jaw surgery to remove the extra teeth I developed odontogenic keratocyst a type of tumor. Even after four surgeries (to remove the extra teeth the tumor and face/jaw reconstruction) and endless hours of therapy I still need major dental work to be healthy. According to several specialists I consulted in the next 1.5- 2 years I require a major surgical intervention including a soft tissue graft to treat my gums another graft possibly from my pelvis or ribs to add more bone to my jaw and implants to replace several missing teeth. I will also need orthodontic braces to correct my jaw alignment.





I desperately need this work done as soon as possible. I’ve been living with some of my jawbone exposed and I’m dependent on painkillers to get through every day. This dental work is estimated to cost in excess of $100000 --much more than I make in a year and my insurance will only cover $3000. Through friends I’ve met a good surgeon here in Washington D.C. who was really moved by my story and agreed to reduce the cost of the treatment to a third of what she and her team would normally charge. But it will still be a huge drain on my limited resources. And that is why I am asking for your help to raise $40000. If you could help me with a donation of any size please know that it will be gratefully accepted. Any amount will help…so I can get the treatment I need to live a normal life free from debilitating pain neural and digestive problems and dependence on painkillers to make it through each day.





Now let me tell you a little more about myself and my ’backstory’...





My name is Nike. My mother was obsessed with gods and goddesses and named me and my brother after them. Nike is the Greek Goddess of Speed Strength and Victory. I am Indonesian from Java and we believe each name is a prayer. My name has become the narrative of my life. I was born 3 months early in a farming community in a small rural village. The hospital was too far away. My family feared that I wouldn’t survive as a tiny premature baby without medical intervention. Against all the odds I pulled through. My next challenge was when I was two and my mother had to leave me to work overseas as a domestic worker like so many other women in our village. But I survived and did well in school. When I was four I could read and do multiplication and division. When I was 9 I won my first mathematics championship in my district. This led to a series of competitions in my teenage years. I moved from my village to Bandungthe capital of West Java when I was 14 to get a better education. I kept studying and competing and eventually won prestigious scholarships to engineering school in Indonesia and later Babson College in Boston.





My mom sadly never witnessed all of those happy moments. She passed away when I was 20 after battling breast cancer for 4 years. I spent most of my childhood without her. She worked so hard and had to move abroad to give me an education. When she died I promised to dedicate my life so no child would have to go through the struggles and loneliness that I went through. . I joined Ashoka to have a platform and resources to bring hope to those in need and especially children and young adults just starting out in life.





In September 2020 I suffered a concussion when a cabinet in my tiny Jakarta apartment collapsed on me. The injury caused me to have problems with my brain functions resulting in light sensitivity concentration issues nausea severe headache migraines and insomnia. I was treated for months but my doctor was puzzled because my brain MRI showed improvement and the brain was healing well but I was still struggling with the headaches migraines and severe head pain. The doctor suggested that I have a panoramic scan of my teeth to see if there was a nerve problem or issue in the head or jaw area.

This is the result of the scan.













I have an abnormality called hyperdontia which means I had extra teeth under my gum on my lower and upper jaw. The concussion triggered the head pain because some of the roots of my teeth on my lower jaw were pressing on the nerve. Growing up poor I never had a proper childhood dental exam so my hyperdontia was never diagnosed.





In January 2021 I was introduced to an orthodontist in Jakarta. She performed surgery to remove the extra teeth in February but couldn’t remove all of my extra teeth because the roots were really close to the nerves. Here's what the x-ray looked like after the surgery.













In March 2020 I needed to travel to Boston after the first surgery. The Jakarta doctor put braces on my teeth in the hope of closing the big gaps in my lower jaw. Due to Covid lockdown I couldn’t return to Jakarta until August 2021. By then the wound was healing but as you can see the root of one of my teeth was destroyed and I had lost significant bone density especially on the lower jaw. The doctor attempted to fix the problem by performing a second surgery in September 2021 to remove one tooth on the top and do a bone graft to reinforce my lower jaw. – Unfortunately it didn’t end well. The doctor did more damage and I was left with 3 big gaps 2 on the lower jaw and 1 on the upper jaw and the bone graft wouldn’t take.





My mouth was constantly bleeding and I couldn’t chew or eat properly resulting in my suffering with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The messy surgery also left me with a cyst on the lower jaw called an “odontogenic keratocyst”. This cyst is also referred to as a “keratocystic odontogenic tumor” because of its tumor-like tendency to recur following surgical treatment. The 2nd surgery also damaged nerves on my lower right lip causing me numbness until today.





As a result of this unsuccessful surgery I needed to find competent oral and maxillofacial surgeons in Indonesia to fix the problems caused by the first doctor’s errors. The type of surgery I needed should be performed by a maxillofacial surgeon. Private Indonesian hospitals and dental practices quoted me a price of $60000-75000 USD to remove the tumor and work on the jaw augmentation project over a two year period. My employer Ashoka Indonesia provided me with basic insurance from the Indonesian government. My complicated dental problems were not covered.





In November 2021 after weeks of searching in different provinces I found a great oral and maxillofacial surgeon in Indonesia willing to work with me. I had to go through multiple hoops with hospitals and tests with different doctors and departments. Finally I underwent my 3rd surgery with a qualified maxillofacial surgeon on January 6 2022. This surgery included multiple odontectomy to remove the cyst sequestrectomy for the lower and upper jaw and a bone graft.





After the surgery in January the surgeon observed that I have a temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMJ) because my jaw has shifted and teeth were lost on the left side. I only chew on my right side. I was referred to a different specialist  a prosthodontist while continuing my jaw augmentation treatment. It turned out the bone graft on the 3rd surgery wasn’t enough to cover the bone loss from my jaw especially the left side of my jaw. I was scheduled for another surgery on March 14 2022. This surgery employed an autograft technique - Iliac crest bone graft the surgeon taking some of my pelvic bone to be grafted onto my upper and lower jaws. The surgery was a joint effort between the maxillofacial surgeon and an advanced trauma orthopedic surgeon. The surgery was performed under general anesthesia and I stayed at the hospital for 6 days. This is my jaw x-ray following the surgery













After the 4th surgery in March I visited the hospital once a week for two months for check-ups. The initial healing of Iliac crest surgery should take 6-8 weeks. However probably due to the multiple surgeries in 2021 and 2022 the doctor diagnosed a soft tissue defect. My gum was severely defective and the wound wouldn’t close easily. When I moved to Washington DC with Ashoka in May 2022 I was still in the healing process and some of the bone of my repaired jawbone has been exposed since then. I’ve been meeting with different surgeons and specialists here in DC to continue my treatment.





I’ve come a long way in my sojourn to find a dental solution --almost two years Indonesia to Washington DC. From too many teeth I now have fewer teeth than normal adults. I am currently living with my jaw bone exposed. I have to carefully brush my teeth after every meal to prevent new infections and jaw bone damage. And I am in pain and dependent on pain-killers to get through each day.





















To finish the process I am going to need several more procedures/surgeries over the next two years because adding new bone and shifting the jaw takes time. I will need soft tissue graft surgery to treat the gum. I will need another bone graft surgery to add more bone density especially to the left side of my jaw. I will need orthodontic braces to correct my jaw alignment and implants to replace the missing teeth.





To do these procedures I need a team of specialists: Oral Maxillofacial Prosthodontist Orthodontist Periodontist. One team of doctors in DC quoted me $100000 for the treatment. My insurance will only cover $3000.





Another path I explored was to go to a university hospital so my case might be presented as a research/learning opportunity in exchange for a 50-70% price discount. I met with Howard University who ultimately referred me to the University of Maryland because Howard doesn’t have the full complement of specialists .





Thank you so much for reading my story in all its painful detail. If you could help me to pay for my surgery I will be eternally grateful. Every donation no matter the size will help. If you have friends who might be moved by my cause please also share my story. And thanks so much for the love good wishes and support I have received. You cannot know how much this cheers me up during this difficult time. Thank you all. Thank You Thank You!…

Corporate profit growth heads into the final peak week of Q3 earnings season stronger than it began. With 85% of companies reporting at this point S&P 500 EPS growth for the quarter remains at 2.2% unchanged from last week. This is a 0.5 percentage point decrease from where expectations stood on Sept 30 and marks the lowest growth rate in two years. (Data from FactSet)

As with every earnings season a majority of blue chip names are beating analysts’ expectations but at a much lower rate for Q3.

Currently 70% of companies have surpassed sell-side profit expectations as compared to the 5-year average of 77%. The percentage by which companies are beating is also subdued at just 2.2% vs. the 10-year average of 6.5%. (Data from FactSet).

Forward looking estimates are also being revised downward with Q4 expectations turning negative in the last week now anticipated to report a YoY decline of 1%. Calendar year 2023 estimates still remain inflated at 5.9% but that number has started to fall (from 8.1% on September 30) as analysts downgrade due to the strong dollar economic slowdown and the fall of some big tech names.

Despite the volatile earnings season companies continue to engage in and authorize share repurchase programs a benefit to shareholders. It is expected that 2022 will be a record for total dollars used to buy back stocks at an estimated $1T surpassing the previous record last year which topped $900M. This is ahead of the new 1% buyback excise tax set to begin in January 2023.

What will the Last Week of Peak Earnings Season Bring?

This week we get Q3 results from 33 S&P 500 companies from a smattering of sectors. Big names to watch include Lyft (LYFT) after their recent announcement of a significant workforce reduction TripAdvisor (TRIP) for a further read on the travel industry and Walt Disney (DIS) for an update on the streaming wars. We also start to get results from some apparel and accessories names such as Tapestry (TPR) Ralph Lauren (RL) and Warby Parker (WRBY).

Potential Surprises in the Week Ahead

This week we get results from a number of large companies on major indexes that have pushed their Q3 earnings dates past their historical norms. Five companies within the S&P 500 confirmed outlier earnings dates for this week all of which are later than usual and therefore have negative DateBreaks Factors*. Those five names are The Mosaic Company (MOS) NiSource (NI) DuPont de Nemours (DD) Steris (STE) and Becton Dickinson & Company (BDX).

NiSource Inc (NI)

Company Confirmed Report Date: Monday November 7 BMO

Projected Report Date (based on historical data): Wednesday November 2 BMO

DateBreaks Factor: -3*

NiSource typically reports Q3 results during the first week of November and they have done so for the last 8 years. There is no day of the week trend but over the last four years NI has reported on a Monday or Wednesday. The confirmed report date of November 7 is five days later than forecasted potentially signaling bad news will be delivered on the upcoming call.

DuPont de Nemours (DD)

Company Confirmed Report Date: Tuesday November 8 BMO

Projected Report Date (based on historical data): Tuesday November 1 BMO

DateBreaks Factor: -3*

Dupont historically has reported Q3 results during the last week of October or the first week of November on a Tuesday or Thursday. As such a report date of November 2 was set. On October 20 DD confirmed an earnings report date of November 8 the latest they’ve reported third quarter results in our 7 year history for that name. This also continues the trend started last year of Tuesday reports after regularly reporting on Thursdays.

Becton Dickinson & Company (BDX)

Company Confirmed Report Date: Thursday November 10 BMO

Projected Report Date (based on historical data): Thursday November 3 BMO

DateBreaks Factor: -3*

Becton Dickinson & Company typically reports their fiscal Q4 results during the first week of November on a Tuesday or Thursday. On October 13 the company confirmed they would release results on November 10 their latest report date in our 10 years of BDX data. This suggests they will share bad news on the call.

Q3 2022 Earnings Wave – Peak Season Continues

This is the last peak week of Q3 earnings season with 3026 companies anticipated to report (out of our universe of 10000 global names). November 10 will be the heaviest report day of the week with 880 companies expected to report. Thus far 80% of companies have confirmed their earnings date and 47% have reported.

Originalist arguments and business interests clash in a dispute over where companies can be sued

By Amy Howe

The Supreme Court will hear oral argument on Tuesday in a major dispute over personal jurisdiction – a court’s power to hear a lawsuit against a defendant. The question in Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway Co. is whether a Pennsylvania court can hear a lawsuit brought against a Virginia-based railroad company by a Virginia man who worked for the railroad in Virginia and Ohio. If the justices answer “yes” businesses could soon be sued for all types of claims in many or all of the states where they do business.

Background

Under the law of personal jurisdiction a plaintiff can always sue a company in the state where the company is incorporated or the state that constitutes its principal place of business. That’s because the courts of those states have “general” jurisdiction over the company. But the ability to sue a company in other states is more limited. Typically a lawsuit in some other state is allowed only in two circumstances: first if the company voluntarily consented to be sued in that state and second if the company engaged in activities there that are connected to the plaintiff’s lawsuit.

Mallory is about a Pennsylvania law that seeks to impose general jurisdiction on any company doing business in the state. Pennsylvania requires out-of-state corporations to register with the state if they want to do business there and under state law that registration gives Pennsylvania courts general jurisdiction over those corporations. Various business groups – as well as the Biden administration – warn that if the Pennsylvania scheme is allowed to stand other states will follow suit an outcome that would dramatically expand states’ ability to exercise jurisdiction over corporations. But supporters of the Pennsylvania law say it is consistent with the original understanding of the Constitution and must be upheld under the current court’s history-based approach to many constitutional questions.

The plaintiff in the case is Robert Mallory who worked for Norfolk Southern Railway Co. for 17 years. During that time Mallory says he was exposed to asbestos and other cancer-causing chemicals and as a result was diagnosed with colon cancer. Mallory went to court in 2017 seeking to hold the railroad liable. Even though the facts underlying the lawsuit did not occur in Pennsylvania Mallory contended that the Pennsylvania courts had jurisdiction over Norfolk Southern because the railroad had registered to do business there.

A state trial court dismissed Mallory’s case agreeing with Norfolk Southern that it did not have jurisdiction over the railroad. Pennsylvania’s registration scheme the trial court concluded violates the 14th Amendment’s due process clause – which among other things guarantees fair treatment by the government – by giving state courts jurisdiction over out-of-state corporations in all circumstances. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court upheld that ruling prompting Mallory to come to the Supreme Court earlier this year.

Mallory’s arguments

In his brief in the Supreme Court Mallory contends that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s holding that the registration scheme violates the Constitution is inconsistent with the “original public meaning” of the 14th Amendment – that is how the amendment would have been commonly understood when it was ratified in 1868. Efforts to discern the “original public meaning” have in recent years become increasingly important in constitutional interpretation. In 1868 Mallory asserts all states required out-of-state corporations that wanted to do business in the state to agree to personal jurisdiction even if the corporations could not have otherwise been brought into court there. At roughly the same time Mallory adds Congress adopted a similar requirement for the District of Columbia.

Mallory also points to the Supreme Court’s 1917 decision in Pennsylvania Fire Insurance Co. of Philadelphia v. Gold Issue Mining & Milling Co. holding that an out-of-state corporation agreed to jurisdiction in Missouri when as required by state law it appointed an agent to accept “service of process” – the legal papers that initiate a lawsuit. The Supreme Court has never overruled its decision in Pennsylvania Fire Mallory writes and there is no good reason to do so now.

Mallory rejects any suggestion that the court’s later rulings on personal jurisdiction somehow undermine the jurisdiction established by Pennsylvania Fire. The court’s 1945 decision in International Shoe Co. v. Washington holding that a state can have jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant when the defendant has sufficient contacts with the state such that it would not be unfair for the defendant to face a lawsuit there simply “established an additional basis for jurisdiction over out-of-state defendants.” The justices in International Shoe did not Mallory stresses weigh in on whether jurisdiction over out-of-state defendants is constitutional when the defendant has consented to jurisdiction. According to Mallory Norfolk consented to jurisdiction in Pennsylvania under the state’s registration scheme.

The Supreme Court’s 1990 decision in Burnham v. Superior Court also makes clear Mallory adds that Pennsylvania’s registration scheme is constitutional. In Burnham the Supreme Court upheld “tag jurisdiction” – the concept of exercising jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant who was served with the lawsuit while visiting the state. If the defendant in Burnham – a father from New Jersey – can be sued based on a visit to California to visit his children Mallory insists there is nothing unfair about also allowing Norfolk Southern which has registered to do business in Pennsylvania and has “thousands of miles of track and a dozen facilities” there to be sued in Pennsylvania.

Norfolk Southern’s arguments

Norfolk Southern counters that the Pennsylvania scheme is “an anachronism — developed in a different era to solve a problem that no longer exists based on a doctrinal foundation that disappeared decades ago.” Indeed it notes Pennsylvania is the only state that uses such a scheme and even Pennsylvania has not weighed in to defend it in this case. Norfolk Southern explains that until the 20th century unless states had laws requiring out-of-state corporations to appoint agents to accept service of a lawsuit corporations could avoid being sued for their activities in states where they did business. But after International Shoe the railroad continues such laws were no longer necessary because a state’s courts could have “specific” jurisdiction – the limited power to hear claims arising from a corporation’s in-state activities – over out-of-state corporations.

But even if International Shoe did not undermine Pennsylvania Fire Norfolk Southern tells the justices the decision in Pennsylvania Fire would still not save the Pennsylvania scheme. Norfolk Southern and other out-of-state corporations did not consent to jurisdiction in Pennsylvania simply by registering to do business there the railroad reasons because the registration process does not say anything about consent.

The Supreme Court’s more recent decisions in Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations v. Brown and Daimler AG v. Bauman Norfolk Southern argues also made clear that a state has general jurisdiction only over corporations that are “at home” in the state.

Norfolk Southern contests Mallory’s originalist view of the 14th Amendment writing that “Mallory badly misstates the ratification-era law and practice.” Unlike the Pennsylvania scheme Norfolk asserts the laws that Mallory cites “overwhelmingly governed claims arising from” business in the forum states. Mallory cannot point to any “decisions that applied all-purpose registration-jurisdiction before ratification and just one decision that did so over the next 28 years” Norfolk Southern concludes.

The Biden administration filed a brief supporting Norfolk Southern. It warns the justices that if Mallory prevails state courts could also hear lawsuits against foreign defendants that arise from their conduct overseas – which the government contends could harm the federal government’s relationships with other countries.

A major rail project that’s a little more than halfway complete in Springfield Illinois is considered by many stakeholders to be a very big deal.

How big? The $475 million project is anticipated to have the biggest impact on the city since the state capital was moved from Vandalia to Springfield in 1839.

The Springfield Rail Improvements Project promises to change the transportation landscape in the area for generations to come serve as an economic and downtown redevelopment catalyst enable the city’s large medical district to expand promote multimodal connectivity improve older neighborhoods’ livability and boost transportation safety.

Divided into six work segments the project calls for creating a six-mile rail corridor with two sets of tracks along the existing 10th Street rail corridor in the heart of the city. The goal: to consolidate all freight- and passenger-rail traffic — involving Amtrak CN Norfolk Southern Railway and Union Pacific Railroad — onto one rail corridor instead of the two that exist now. The Amtrak/UP and NS corridors run through downtown Springfield.

The project includes the construction of eight underpasses one overpass and 20 new grade separations in total as well as the replacement of four rail bridges and 36 grade crossing closures. The number of crossings in the project area will be reduced from 68 to 32. To prevent trespassing the entire new corridor will be fenced.

The project partners include the four railroads city Sangamon County Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) Federal Railroad Administration and Hanson Professional Services Inc. which designs and manages the work components.

The Springfield Rail Improvements Project also factors into two new major transportation facilities coming to the corridor: an Amtrak station and parking garage that’s slated to start in mid-2023 and be completed in 2025 and a Sangamon Mass Transit District transportation center that’s under construction and scheduled to open in mid-2023.

Now about 60% complete since it began in 2019 the rail project is expected to wrap up by 2025’s end.

The Springfield Rail Improvements Project is one of the longest and nearly continuous-running construction undertakings the NS Public Projects Department has ever handled says Andrew Vollmer a regional manager in the Class I’s real estate department. By the time it’s completed the project will have covered a nearly 15-year construction cycle.

The multiple partners have maintained strong ties throughout the project from the visionary stages through implementation says Vollmer. The federal state and local government partners helped secure federal and state funding for the entire project including six federal grants.

In addition the public partners were willing to segment the project into digestible construction pieces rather than pursue an “all-or-nothing” approach and have collaborated well with NS from the onset says Vollmer.

“Accordingly we have been willing and able to internally prioritize resources for the 10th Street corridor consolidation in the face of extensive engineering design plans aggressive construction bid letting schedules and complex construction phasing coordination” he says.

For Springfield residents and visitors the project will help make road travel safer especially in the downtown area.

“The advantage to the public is that all trains will only go through one area and there won’t be as many crossings” says Vollmer.

For NS the railroad will gain more efficiencies with a new mainline and a new 9000-foot signalized siding.

Norfolk Southern Railway

“We can put a merchandise train on the siding and have a larger intermodal train pass by more safely and quickly” says Vollmer.

The city and IDOT were wise to contract railroad engineering consultant Hanson Professional Services to manage the project’s entire lifecycle he believes. Such consultants know how railroads operate and what the industry’s design standards are and understand the unique coordination and communication requirements of large rail projects.

“Sometimes public agencies treat railroad projects as though they were highway projects — and traditionally that can lead to a host of avoidable problems” Vollmer says.

Headquartered in Springfield Hanson Professional Services knows the community and area’s political landscape well says Sergio Pecori the firm’s chairman and CEO.

“If there were any political hurdles we could explain the issues better” he says.

The project also will result in a quiet zone being implemented downtown and land becoming freed up along the soon-to-be-eliminated rail corridor which will help the medical district expand and create space for a possible bike path park and other developments says Pecori.

With more than three years to go the project partners are hoping to avoid any snags that could impede completion. But complications are bound to surface such as mounting inflation.

“What keeps us up at night is inflation. We wonder: What will it do to costs?” Pecori says. “And the tight supply chain for electrical equipment in buildings is causing a bit of angst.”

Nonetheless the project schedule is on target.

“We’re in pretty good shape” says Pecori.

The incident took place early Sunday morning on the tracks near the Costonia exit between Steubenville and Toronto.

The train was made up of 15 cars containing trash. Debris could be seen floating down the river and covering the tracks.

""We believe somewhere around 7 o'clock this morning when it was first reported. Obviously some environmental damage within the river with the trash. They do have booms out to control and try to catch as much of it as they possibly can. They got RJ Corman services in here train services here and doing the clean up on the actual cars and all that and trying to get the actual track repaired"" said Jefferson County EMA Director Rob Herrington.

Real estate investment trusts the most common way to invest in property are down 29% this year through last week according to FTSE EPRA/NAREIT’s global index. That compares unfavorably with stocks in general worldwide: The MSCI ACWI benchmark was off just 21%.

So when will things turn around for these REITs which cover everything from offices to apartments to warehouses? Conventional wisdom says the economy now seeming to teeter on the edge of a recession will have to be expanding once more. But a Northern Trust Asset Management director concludes that now-burgeoning interest rates also need to settle down. Then “you’ll get real estate outperformance” says Dan Phillips NTAM’s director of asset management strategy and head of the team that wrote the report.

Escalating interest rates around the world have done a number on equities overall but have really zapped REIT shares as they represent an industry that uses borrowed money as lifeblood. At the same time valuations are low now which means bargains can be nabbed. The New York Common Retirement Fund for instance recently allocated $200 million to buy health-care properties.

Interest rates are continuing to rise and that ups the ante on risk the NTAM report notes. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell upset the stock market last week with his remarks that rates have “a way to go” before topping out. No one knows when that might be.

What’s needed for REITs the report goes on is a “stabilized interest rate environment” that will allow investors to “take advantage of attractive valuations and a market that seems too pessimistic on potential growth opportunities.”

The study concludes after crunching data back to 1994 that REITs worldwide tend to do best when the economy is growing and inflation is low and with it interest rates. REITs didn’t perform well for instance in the late 1990s when rates were picking up and dotcom companies were getting all the attention. Then in the early 2000s rates went down and real estate investments flourished.

The U.S. which commands the global REIT market with a 58% share sports valuations that “are arguably most attractive.” Apartments and industrials are most compelling as they have low vacancy levels the paper says. You wouldn’t know that from equity performance with apartments down 33.5% this year and industrials off 38.4%.

Snowflake’s latest advancements empower users to do more with their data enhancing productivity and unlocking new ways to develop applications pipelines and machine learning models with Snowflake’s single data platform.

Snowflake Brings Python-Based App Development Directly to the Data Cloud

Streamlit acquired by Snowflake in March 2022 enables tens of thousands of data scientists and other developers to easily build data applications with Python using its open source framework. Following the acquisition Snowflake is now advancing its Streamlit integration (in development) so developers can bring their data and machine learning (ML) models to life as secure interactive applications — all within Snowflake.

Snowflake’s Streamlit integration will bring together Streamlit’s ease of use and flexibility with Snowflake’s scalability governed data coverage and security so developers can build powerful applications without the traditional complexity involved with building and deploying web applications. The integration will allow developers to create applications with Python using their data in Snowflake deploy and run these applications on Snowflake’s secure and governed platform and share their applications with business teams to further unlock the value of data and ML models.

“Streamlit serves as the interaction engine for the vast majority of our Data Science & Machine Learning models today actively transforming how our teams build deploy and collaborate on powerful applications with other stakeholders across the business” said Sai Ravuru GM Data Science & Analytics JetBlue. “With Snowflake’s Streamlit integration we can go from data to ML-insights all within the Snowflake ecosystem where our data is already present making it easier and more secure for us to create impactful applications to further mitigate the negative impact of flight disruptions provide more predictability to our operational planning teams and more customer personalization to give our customers the best possible experience.”

Snowflake Extends the Power of Python to All Users with Expansive Snowpark Ecosystem

With Python as the most1 popular language for data scientists and the third2 most popular language among all developers Snowflake is now making Python and its rich ecosystem of open source libraries available to all users and teams with the general availability of Snowpark for Python. In the months since its public preview announcement and expanded Anaconda integration at Snowflake Summit 2022 Snowpark for Python has seen 6x growth in adoption with hundreds of customers including Charter Communications EDF NerdWallet Northern Trust Sophos and more building with their data using Snowpark.

With Snowpark as Snowflake’s developer framework developers gain a streamlined architecture that natively supports users’ programming languages of choice including Java Scala SQL and now Python. Snowpark for Python is part of the wider Snowpark ecosystem bringing teams together so that they can collaborate and build on one unified platform with a highly secure Python sandbox providing developers with the same scalability elasticity security and compliance benefits they’ve come to expect when building with Snowflake. In addition developers can eliminate data security and compliance roadblocks that have previously prevented projects from going into production. Snowflake is also releasing Snowpark-optimized warehouses (public preview in AWS) so Python developers can run large scale ML training and other memory-intensive operations directly in Snowflake and Python Worksheets (private preview) to develop applications data pipelines and ML models inside Snowflake.

A series of historic dining experiences organized in partnership with the Singapore Pavilion will showcase GOOD Meat’s real high-quality meat made from animal cells for the first time outside of the Southeast Asian city-state where it debuted nearly two years ago.

In a first for the fast-growing global cultivated meat industry and for the U.N.’s annual climate summit food system transformation and sustainable diets will be on the menu – literally and figuratively – in the host city of Sharm el-Sheikh Egypt. GOOD Meat will serve its cultivated chicken Saturday Nov. 12 through Monday Nov. 14 at invitation-only events for media ministerial-level guests and representatives from civil society as heads of state and thousands of delegates from countries around the world meet to tackle a range of topics related to rising global temperatures.

The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (UNIPCC) heralded cultivated meat as a “transformative” approach to mitigating emissions and cited conventional animal agriculture as one of the top causes of greenhouse gas emissions. According to a 2022 UNIPCC report cultivated meat has the potential to deliver substantial reductions in direct emissions from food production. “ These technologies have lower land water and nutrient footprints and address concerns over animal welfare” the report stated.

“We hope our guests at COP27 find their cultivated chicken meals both delicious and thought-provoking and they leave the summit with a new appreciation for the role food innovation can play in combating the global climate crisis. There is no better place to launch our next version than right here at the world’s most consequential climate change gathering"" said Josh Tetrick co-founder and CEO of Eat Just. “ Singapore was the first country to allow the sale of meat made without tearing down a single forest or displacing an animal’s habitat and we look forward to other countries following in their footsteps.”

GOOD Meat won regulatory approval for its chicken in Singapore in November 2020 and remains the only cultivated meat company in the world with the ability to sell to consumers. Since its launch the company’s chicken has been featured on menus at local fine dining establishments roadside hawker stalls and via foodpanda Asia's leading food and grocery delivery platform. The latest version of GOOD Meat’s cultivated chicken will become available in Singapore following its debut at COP27.

Bringing Food Innovation into Focus at COP27

In the years since the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) established an international treaty aimed at preventing “ dangerous human interference with the climate system” climate action leaders have pressed the U.N. to emphasize food and agriculture as key drivers of climate change and to leverage the conference to explore potential solutions. At COP27 these issues will take center stage with sampling events exhibitions workshops and talks. New to the conference this year are three dedicated spaces for dialogue: the Food and Agriculture Pavilion Food4Climate Pavilion and Food Systems Pavilion.

The Singapore Pavilion in partnership with GOOD Meat the Good Food Institute Asia Pacific (GFI APAC) and others will showcase food innovation efforts and collaborations that support food resilience and security. On Saturday Nov. 12 Eat Just’s Tetrick will join executives from fellow food tech startups Growthwell Foods and TurtleTree as well as the Singapore Food Agency and Nurasa (formerly Asia Sustainable Foods Platform) in a discussion about ensuring a steady sustainable food supply.

Later that day Singapore Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu and Dr. Yasmine Fouad Minister of Environment for the Arabic Republic of Egypt will discuss their countries’ respective efforts to overcome food security challenges during a conversation with GFI APAC Managing Director Mirte Gosker. At a reception following the program guests will sample innovative products like JUST Egg Eat Just’s award-winning plant-based egg brand. On Monday Nov. 14 the Singapore Pavilion and Minister Fu will host a ministerial-level dinner featuring GOOD Meat cultivated chicken.

Middle East Consumers Want Cultivated Meat

As climate negotiations unfold in Sharm el-Sheikh and planning for next year’s U.N. summit in Dubai begins a new poll of more than 2000 consumers in six key Middle East countries found that a vast majority of respondents would purchase cultivated meat and switch to it from conventional meat assuming it was Halal sold at a comparable cost and tasted the same as what they are used to. Safety of cultivated meat and its role as a source of protein will be key drivers of consumption according to the GOOD Meat-commissioned study conducted by PSB Insights a leading independent consulting firm.

Climate messaging was one of the most effective tools to influence purchase intent with respondents in Egypt Israel Kuwait Qatar Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Young people in particular believe technology-driven solutions are the answer to climate change challenges. Further respondents said they would be willing to pay more if cultivated meat could show it’s healthier and safer than traditional meat.

Additional findings showed a strong preference among Middle East consumers for more domestically produced food and over half were worried about long-term food security. Many believe cultivated meat production could help address both of those concerns. GOOD Meat will share additional findings from the study during its COP27 events.

We visited a school where staff did 4000 home visits in one year to support pupils

Every morning after registers – come rain sleet or sun – up to six cars with experienced teachers leave North Shore Academy to go door knocking to boost attendance.

The school in Stockton-on-Tees was struggling with around 87 per cent attendance in 2017. Too many children were at home every day and leaders were determined to get kids back in the classroom.

In one year staff did 4000 home visits to ensure pupils had the support they need.

When Ofsted visited in July last year attendance was 94 per cent. The school – ‘requires improvement’ in 2018 – was rated ‘outstanding’ in every category. Seventy per cent of pupils are entitled to free school meals.

‘It’s the challenge of breaking a culture’

Paige Leahy  attendance officer at the school said door knocks focus on those with attendance below 97 per cent or where there’s no reason for being off school.

Schools Week accompanied Lehay on a drive around this week. Before we left the school the team were rattling through names to check who was in calling parents. It was like a military operation.

Leahy

Our hitlist was ready so we hit the road. Three of the four door knocks went unanswered. But a note saying they had visited was pushed through the letterbox. If parents do not provide a reason for absence they get another visit at 11am.

Lehay says it acts as a welfare check to “make sure they are poorly”.

Michael Robson the head in 2017 who was behind the door-knocking strategy said the policy is about safeguarding and checking if the family needs support.

But Robson now executive principal of Northern Education Trust which has run the school since 2012 said there is also “a bit of challenge around knocking on the door repeatedly. “[It’s about] looking at parents and saying ‘I know you’re saying he’s not very well but it’s the fifth time this half term he’s missed a Friday’.

“Some of it was influencing change and a bit of challenge around breaking that culture of children being off when they really ought not to be.”

Home visits are arranged into postcode clusters saving time.

Trust leads attendance push

The practice is now embedded across NET’s 22 schools serving some of the most deprived areas in the north.

NET uses a trust-wide attendance dashboard which pulls data straight from management information systems overnight.

This shows real-time attendance patterns for all key groups of pupils. Principals must send a weekly report to the trust’s senior leaders.

NET has set up its own “attendance hub” – backed by government – to share their strategy for free with others.

In return schools need to commit to revisit their own protocols. It got 250 requests to join but has capped numbers at 58.

Less scope for smaller schools

But the pilot is only aimed at secondary schools with a “similar context and challenges to North Shore”.

It highlights a potential limitation with the situation – it requires money and crucially teacher time to be implemented properly.

Robson

NET can afford the investment because it uses lean staffing models based on curriculum-led financial planning. It means even smaller schools across the trust can benefit from the support.

“That’s where the advantage of our small schools being in a large MAT kick in” Robson said. But it makes such an approach unrealistic for schools on their own or in smaller trusts.

While the government has hired 13 absence advisers to improve attendance nationally a Schools Week investigation suggests over 600 attendance staff have been slashed from councils since 2010.

North Shore has three staff dedicated to just attendance and also uses time from other non-teacher roles for the home visits.

The focus can also not let up. The school has already done more than 500 home visits this half-term alone equating to 3000 this academic year.

Attendance on the curriculum

Rob Tarn NET’s chief executive said other trusts are keen to run similar hubs but based on their own specialisms to tailor their approach.

One of the schools involved in the hub is Queen Elizabeth Academy in Warwickshire. It had persistent absence last year of 37 per cent. But this is now 17 per cent.

Beth Gibson assistant principal attributes the drop in part to their bespoke attendance curriculum which is taught in tutor time.

It translates how attendance could be problematic within college and employment as well as the link to earnings such as hourly pay."

A Northrop Grumman Cygnus resupply spacecraft is on its way to the International Space Station with more than 8200 pounds of science investigations and cargo after launching at 5:32 a.m. EST Monday from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia.

NASA Television the NASA app and the agency’s website will provide live coverage of the spacecraft’s approach beginning at 3:30 a.m. Wednesday Nov. 9. Cygnus is scheduled to arrive at the space station around 5:05 a.m. Installation coverage will resume at 7:15 a.m. Watch all events at:

https://www.nasa.gov/live

NASA astronaut Nicole Mann will use the space station’s robotic Canadarm2 to capture Cygnus upon its arrival while NASA astronaut Josh Cassada monitors telemetry during rendezvous capture and installation on the Earth-facing port of the Unity module.

Northrop Grumman’s 18th cargo flight to the space station is the seventh under its Commercial Resupply Services 2 contract with NASA. The Cygnus spacecraft which Northrop Grumman dubbed ‘S.S. Sally Ride’ after late NASA astronaut physicist and first American woman to fly in space Sally Ride launched on an Antares 230+ rocket from the Virginia Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport’s Pad 0A at Wallops.

The resupply mission will support dozens of the more than 250 investigations that will be conducted during Expedition 68. Included in the scientific investigations are:

Bioprinting tissues

The BioFabrication Facility successfully printed a partial human knee meniscus and a large volume of human heart cells during its first trip to space in 2019. Now the facility is returning to the microgravity laboratory with new capabilities to further human tissue printing research. The 3D bioprinter tests whether microgravity enables the printing of tissue samples of higher quality than those printed on the ground. These technologies could be used to help alleviate organ shortages for patients in need of transplants.

Assessing how plants adapt in space

Plants exposed to spaceflight undergo changes that involve the addition of extra information to their DNA which regulates how genes turn on or off but does not change the sequence of the DNA itself. This process is known as epigenetic change. Plant Habitat-03 assesses whether such adaptations in one generation of plants grown in space can transfer to the next generation. The research could inform the development of plants better suited for use on future missions to provide food and other services. Results also could help develop or adapt crops and other economically important plants to grow in marginal and reclaimed habitats on Earth.

Mudflow mixtures

Catastrophic mudflows after wildfires can carry heavy boulders and debris downhill which is dangerous to humans and causes significant damage to infrastructure and watersheds. Post-Wildfire Mudflow Micro-Structure evaluates the composition of these mudflows which include sand water and trapped air. Results could improve understanding of the fundamental mechanisms that govern post-wildfire debris movement including how mudflows trap air bubbles and carry heavy boulders. This investigation also could help develop and validate models to predict the spread and velocity of debris flows and their effect on houses other infrastructure and natural obstacles.

Ovarian cell development in microgravity

Sponsored by NASA and the Italian Space Agency (ASI) and coordinated by ASI the Modulation of Granulosa and Theca Cells Activity in Microgravity: Consequences for Human Health and Reproduction (OVOSPACE) investigation examines the effect of microgravity on bovine cell cultures as living for prolonged times in the reduced microgravity environment could impair fertility. OVOSPACE results could improve fertility treatments on Earth and help prepare for future human settlement in space.

First satellites from Uganda Zimbabwe

The Joint Global Multi-Nation Birds Project-5 (BIRDS-5) is a constellation of three CubeSats to be deployed after arrival at the space station: PEARLAFRICASAT-1 the first satellite developed by Uganda; ZIMSAT-1 Zimbabwe’s first satellite; and TAKA from Japan. BIRDS-5 performs multispectral observations of Earth using a commercial off-the-shelf camera and demonstrates a high-energy electronic measuring instrument. The statistical data collected could help distinguish bare ground from forest and farmland and possibly indicate the quality of agricultural growth. A cross-border university project BIRDS provides students from developing nations with hands-on satellite development opportunities laying a foundation for similar space technology projects in their home countries that ultimately could lead to sustainable space programs there.

These are just a sample of the hundreds of investigations currently conducted aboard the orbiting laboratory in the areas of biology and biotechnology physical sciences and Earth and space science. Such research benefits people on Earth and lays the groundwork for future human exploration through the agency’s Artemis missions which will send astronauts to the Moon to prepare for future expeditions to Mars.

Cygnus also will deliver a new mounting bracket that astronauts will attach to the starboard side of the station’s truss assembly during a spacewalk planned for Tuesday Nov. 15. The mounting bracket will enable the installation of one of the next pair of new solar arrays later this year.

The spacecraft will remain at the space station until January before it disposes of several thousand pounds of trash through its destructive re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere.

Northrop Grumman’s 18th contracted cargo resupply mission with NASA to the International Space Station will deliver more than 8000 pounds of science and research crew supplies and vehicle hardware to the orbital laboratory and its crew. The CRS-18 Cygnus spacecraft is named after the first American woman in space Sally Ride.

Laden with 8200 pounds (3700 kilograms) of payloads and supplies for the seven-person Expedition 68 crew Northrop Grumman Corp.’s NG-18 Cygnus cargo ship—named in honor of America’s first woman in space Sally Ride—is zeroing-in on a berth at the International Space Station (ISS) following its 5:32:42 a.m. EST Monday launch from Pad 0A at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS) on Wallops Island Va. Ride who died in July 2012 becomes the second member of NASA’s inaugural class of Space Shuttle astronauts to be recognized with a Cygnus mission.

The choice of Ride for NG-18 follows Northrop Grumman’s tradition of naming each Cygnus for someone who pioneered human spaceflight. “Ride became the American female astronaut serving on the crew of the second flight of Challenger” the company noted last month “and was a steadfast advocate for diversity and equality in science inspiring countless women to pursue STEM careers.”

Ride was selected by NASA in January 1978 one of 35 candidates—the “Thirty-Five New Guys”—which included the first six women ever hired for astronaut training. In June 1983 she served aboard Challenger on STS-7 controlling the shuttle’s Canadian-built Remote Manipulator System (RMS) mechanized arm to deploy and retrieve the Shuttle Pallet Satellite (SPAS).

A year later in October 1984 Ride flew a second time on Challenger on STS-41G. During that mission she again utilized the RMS to deploy the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS).

In addition to Ride previous Cygnus missions honored Challenger’s Ellison Onizuka Columbia veterans Rick Husband and Kalpana “K.C.” Chawla moonwalkers Gene Cernan John Young and Al Bean and Apollo 1’s Roger Chaffee. Added to that list are five other shuttle flyers legendary “Original Seven” Mercury and Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP) astronaut Deke Slayton “Hidden Figures” mathematician Katherine Johnson former NASA Deputy Administrator James “J.R.” Thompson and Manned Orbital Laboratory (MOL) astronaut selectee Robert Lawrence.

Integration of Cygnus’ Pressurized Cargo Module (PCM) was completed at prime contractor Thales Alenia Space’s facility in Turin Italy last June. It was delivered to the launch site on Wallops Island later in the summer.

Launch had originally been targeted for mid-August. But it was pushed firstly to the second week of October and ultimately into early November in response to “supply-chain issues”.

Cygnus’ unpressurized Service Module concluded its pre-flight build and checkout at Northrop Grumman’s Dulles Va. factory before being transported to Wallops for mating to the PCM. Last month the complete spacecraft—which stands 21 feet (6.4 meters) tall and boasts an internal pressurized volume of 950 cubic feet (27 cubic meters)—was transferred to Wallops’ Horizontal Integration Facility (HIF) for final processing.

Aboard NG-18 is a haul of payloads equipment and supplies for the incumbent Expedition 68 crew which comprises Commander Sergei Prokopyev fellow Russian cosmonauts Dmitri Petelin and Anna Kikina U.S. astronauts Frank Rubio Nicole Mann and Josh Cassada and Japan’s Koichi Wakata. The two crews arrived at the ISS via two different vehicles: Prokopyev Petelin and Rubio aboard Russia’s Soyuz MS-22 in September and Mann Cassada Wakata and Kikina aboard SpaceX’s Dragon Endurance early last month.

All told the payload includes 3608 pounds (1637 kilograms) of supplies for the Expedition 68 crew together with 1873 pounds (850 kilograms) of science investigations 145 pounds (66 kilograms) of Extravehicular Activity (EVA) gear 2375 pounds (1077 kilograms) of vehicle hardware and 172 pounds (78 kilograms) of computer resources. The total cargo tips the scales at 8173 pounds (3707 kilograms) and inclusive of package NG-18’s complete pressurized load reaches 8265 pounds (3749 kilograms)

Just last week Mann and Cassada began Robotics On-Board Training (ROBoT) tasks in readiness for Cygnus’ arrival. The duo will be at the controls of the 57.7-foot (17.6-meter) Canadarm2 robotic arm inside the multi-windowed cupola around 5 a.m. EST on Wednesday 9 November to oversee the capture and berthing of the cargo ship.

Tuesday’s capture of Cygnus will be monitored by Nicole Mann and Josh Cassada from the station’s multi-windowed cupola. Photo Credit: NASA

Mann will serve as prime crew member for the capture with Cassada backing her up. Cygnus will be berthed a couple of hours later at the Earth-facing (or “nadir”) port of the station’s Unity node where it will remain until its departure in late January.

Weather conditions for Sunday’s opening launch attempt were predicted to be 80-percent-favorable with the main concern centering upon a slight chance of low-level clouds. “Unseasonably warm conditions and tranquil weather are expected through the weekend” NASA announced last week.

“A cold front will be located over the Appalachian Mountains Sunday morning providing light southerly surface flow and upper-level cirrus cloudiness over the Wallops Region” it was added. “An increase of low-level moisture over the Wallops Region due to the light winds may provide some low-level clouds…near launch time.”

Early Sunday with weather having begun to trend upwards to 90-percent-favorable engineers and flight controllers came to their consoles at Wallops to begin powering up the 133-foot-tall (40.5-meter) Antares 230+ booster and chilling its propellant systems with liquid nitrogen. Tanking was critically timed to adhere to temporal limits associated with the rapid boil-off of Antares’ cryogenic oxygen.

But Sunday was not to be Antares’ day as a scrub was called in the final ten minutes before T-0 in response to a fire alarm in Wallops mission operations control room which required an evacuation. Liftoff was rescheduled for a five-minute “window” opening at 5:27 a.m. EST on Monday 7 November with the forecast promising 75-percent-favorable weather.

A final poll of flight controllers came in two phases and by T-15 minutes the rocket’s propellant tanks had reached proper flight pressures and were verified at “Flight Ready” levels. Shortly afterwards the vehicle transitioned to Internal Power and at T-11 minutes the Transporter-Erector-Launcher (TEL) was armed to effect a rapid retraction when the countdown clock hit T-0.

Fed by a mixture of liquid oxygen and a highly refined form of rocket-grade kerosene known as “RP-1” Antares took flight at 5:32:42 a.m. EST right at the end of Monday’s five-minute window. The first stage’s pair of Russian-built RD-181 engines powered the booster smoothly uphill from the pretty seaside environs of the Virginia Coast burning fiercely for 200 seconds before shutting down on time at an altitude of 52.3 miles (84.1 kilometers).

The first stage separated shortly thereafter followed by the rocket’s bullet-like payload fairing and inter-stage. This was followed by ignition of Antares’ solid-fueled Castor-30XL upper stage motor which burned for 2.5 minutes to propel Cygnus into low-Earth orbit. The point of orbital insertion was estimated at an altitude of 109.5 miles (176.2 kilometers).

Two minutes after burnout of the Castor-30XL motor some nine minutes after leaving Earth Cygnus was separated into free flight to commence its two-day trek to the ISS. But as this article was being prepared only one of the cargo ship’s fan-like solar arrays had deployed.

“Northrop Grumman is gathering data on the second array deployment and is working closely with NASA” it was noted. “Northrop Grumman has reported to NASA that Cygnus has sufficient power to rendezvous with the International Space Station on Wednesday to complete its primary mission and NASA is assessing this and the configuration required for capture and berthing.”

Aboard NG-18 are a multitude of research payloads for Expedition 68 and beyond. The BioFabrication Facility (BFF) seeks to print organ-like tissues in microgravity and a study flying on this mission seeks to advance understanding the 3D biological printing of highly complex human tissues and organs in space. It will attempt to print a meniscus (or knee cartilage) tissue using bioinks and cells.

Uganda and Zimbabwe are flying their first national CubeSats through the Japanese-led Joint Global Multinational Birds Program (BIRDS) an interdisciplinary satellite project for non-spacefaring nations. The three CubeSats—Uganda’s PEARLAFRICASAT-1 Zimbabwe’s ZIMSAT-1 and Japan’s TAKA—are outfitted with off-the-shelf subsystems and equipped with a four-band multispectral optical imager for Earth observations.

Other experiments include a U.S./Italian joint investigation into how the microgravity environment influences ovary function how changes to space-grown plants are transmitted through seeds to the next generation and how catastrophic mudflows evolve in the wake of wildfires. Also aboard NG-18 is a 330-pound (150-kilogram) ISS Roll-Out Solar Array (iROSA) modification kit which will be installed on 15 November by spacewalkers Josh Cassada and Frank Rubio.

As previously reported by AmericaSpace three pairs of Boeing-built iROSAs will be installed to cover (and partially “shadow”) six of the station’s eight “legacy” Solar Array Wings (SAWs) affording a power hike of 20-30 percent in readiness for future ISS expansion and customers’ burgeoning payload needs. Original plans identified six power channels—2B and 4B on the P-6 truss 4A on the P-4 truss 1A and 3A on the S-4 truss and 3B on the S-6 truss—which would derive greatest benefit from having iROSAs in place. Power Channels 2A on the P-4 truss and 1B on the S-6 truss were not initially earmarked for iROSA modification.

Ahead of the installation of each iROSA a modification kit would be fitted to provide a support-bracket for the arrays. In February of last year Expedition 64 spacewalkers Kate Rubins Victor Glover and Soichi Noguchi installed the first such modification kit at the base of the P-6 truss and the following June—after the arrival of the arrays themselves aboard the CRS-22 Cargo Dragon—Expedition 65’s Shane Kimbrough and Thomas Pesquet executed three complex sessions of Extravehicular Activity (EVA) to emplace and activate the first two iROSAs on the 2B/4B power channel.

In September 2021 Pesquet and crewmate Aki Hoshide set up a modification kit for the third iROSA array working at the base of the P-4 truss. And last March Expedition 66 spacewalkers Kayla Barron and Raja Chari labored on another modification kit on the S-4 truss.

Their iROSA arrays—augmenting Channels 4A and 3A—will arrive at the space station later this month aboard the CRS-26 Cargo Dragon. Current plans envisage a pair of spacewalks the first no sooner than 28 November to install the Channel 3A array the second no earlier than 1 December to add the iROSA for Channel 4A.

With four out of six iROSA arrays hopefully in place before year’s end only two more will remain. NASA recently opted to modify Power Channel 1B on the S-6 truss and Cassada and Rubio will fit a modification kit during an EVA on 15 November. Another spacewalk next January will do likewise on Channel 1A on the S-4 truss.

Left unmodified under the new plan are Channels 2A on the P-4 truss and 3B on the S-6 truss. In explaining the change NASA noted that engineers had “re-evaluated power-draws” on all channels and correspondingly “reallocated the installation of iROSAs”.

It was added that there is no timeframe for when the iROSA arrays for 1B and 1A are set to arrive. But the Cargo Dragon visiting vehicle manifest for 2023 provisionally locates them aboard the CRS-27 mission scheduled for January.

A Northrop Grumman rocket carrying more than 4 tons of supplies for the International Space Station will have to wait at least one more day to launch after a fire alarm at its mission control center thwarted a liftoff early Sunday (Nov. 6).

The Antares rocket was about 10 minutes away from a planned liftoff at 5:50 a.m. EST (1050 GMT) from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility on Wallops Island Virginia when Northrop Grumman called off the flight. A fire alarm at the company's control center in nearby Dulles Virginia forced a building evacuation preventing launch controllers from going through with the launch.

""Our thoughts are with their team their their safety is at the top most important so we are going to try it again tomorrow"" NASA spokesperson Chelsey Ballarte said during live commentary. Liftoff is now set for Monday Nov. 7 at 5:27 a.m. EST (1027 GMT). You can watch the Cygnus cargo launch live on Space.com courtesy of NASA TV beginning at 5 a.m. EST (1000 GMT).

Northrop Grumman will use its Antares rocket to launch the uncrewed NG-18 Cygnus spacecraft to the International Space Station on a mission to deliver more than 8200 pounds (3720 kilograms) of supplies to the lab's astronaut crew. It is the 18th cargo mission for NASA by Northrop Grumman.

The upcoming launch is also Northrop Grumman's heaviest delivery yet with the company squeezing in about 44 pounds (20 kg) of additional supplies due to refinements to the launch system. Among its precious cargo are a bioprinter that will attempt to print human knee cartilage in space and cow ovarian cells to study how weightlessness affects the growth of cells.

If all goes well the NG-18 Cygnus cargo ship — which has been named the SS Sally Ride in honor of astronaut Sally Ride the first American woman in space who died in 2012 — should arrive at the space station on Wednesday (Nov. 10).

The condition of the array and what might have caused the problem were not immediately clear. Dina Contella operations integration manager of the space station said a final decision on whether to proceed with the Cygnus spacecraft's capture and berthing Wednesday will not be made until after an engineering analysis.

But engineers will get a good look at the array during the cargo ship's final approach and Contella said she was optimistic Northrop Grumman eventually will get the circular panel deployed and locked in place.

""Right now the array is not deployed"" she said. ""And so the team is trying to assess the data (and) figure out their next step. ... I'm very hopeful actually that Northrop is going to find a way to deploy the array fully. I think that we have a really good chance at getting there.""

Running a day late because of a fire alarm that forced Northrop Grumman engineers to evacuate their control center Sunday the Antares 230+ rocket's two Russian-built RD-181 engines ignited at 5:32 a.m. EST pushing the booster away from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility.

Arcing away to the southeast the rocket smoothly accelerated as its Ukraine-built first stage consumed propellant and lost weight climbing directly into the plane of the space station's orbit. Nine minutes after liftoff the Cygnus cargo ship was released to fly on its own.

""It was a spectacular launch"" said Jeff Arend manager of space station systems engineering and integration. ""We're happy that Cygnus is on its way to the ISS.""

If all goes well the cargo ship will catch up with the space station early Wednesday pulling up to within about 30 feet and holding position while Nicole Mann operating the lab's robot arm locks onto a grapple fixture.

At that point flight controllers at the Johnson Space Center in Houston will take over arm operations pulling the Cygnus in for berthing at the Earth-facing port of the station's central Unity module. But that assumes clearance to proceed with a possibly stowed or partially deployed solar array.

On board the cargo ship: 3608 pounds of crew supplies 1873 pounds of research gear 2375 pounds of space station hardware and 317 pounds of computer components and spacewalk equipment including hardware needed for upcoming excursions to upgrade the lab's solar power system.

The manifest also includes some ""much-deserved treats for the crew"" Arend said.

""They will have their usual menu but also some special requests like peanut butter olives several cheeses and even pumpkin spice cappuccino"" he said. ""And the team has loaded some fresh fruit as well — apples blueberries oranges — and some ice cream in the freezers.""

The launching marked the next-to-last Antares 230+ flight as Northrop Grumman and Firefly Aerospace develop a new rocket in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine the imposition of U.S. sanctions and the subsequent termination of RD-181 deliveries for use in the Ukraine-built first stage.

The first stages used for Monday's launch and one more Antares flight planned for next March were already on hand when hardware deliveries were cut off following the Russian invasion.

In the transition to a new rocket Northrop Grumman plans to launch three Cygnus flights using SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets before the all-American Antares 330 debuts in late 2024."

The global cruise company operating Norwegian Cruise Line Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Sea Cruises has planned a timeline which includes sourcing 25 percent of cage-free eggs from U.S. suppliers in 2022 50 percent from global suppliers in 2023 75% from global suppliers in 2025 and 100 percent from global suppliers by the end of 2025.

“We applaud Norwegian Cruise Lines Holdings for publicly publishing their global cage-free implementation plans. As the demand for cage-free eggs increases worldwide cage-free is becoming the industry standard. Other hospitality companies like Millennium Hotels and Langham Hospitality Group need to follow NCLH’s lead or risk losing business” said Jennie Hunter Senior Campaigns Coordinator The Open Wings Alliance.

The decision comes following a cage-free campaign steered by the Open Wing Alliance which aims to create a unified front for ending the abuse of chickens worldwide. The Open Wing Alliance is a global coalition initiated by The Humane League and includes 93 animal protection organizations from 67 countries worldwide.

In 2021 two other cruise lines Carnival Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean have made similar commitments and have published their implementation plans for sourcing cage-free eggs by 2025.

As consumer demand for cage-free eggs continues to grow companies worldwide are announcing their plans for cage-free commitments.

Over 100 companies including some of the biggest corporations around the world have made such commitments to switch to cage-free systems including Nestlé Aldi InterContinental Hotels Sodexo Kraft Heinz Compass Group Shake Shack Famous Brands Costa Coffee Burger King Dunkin’ Krispy Kreme Unilever and Barilla.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYXRyYWRlLWNydWlzZS5jb20vbGVnYWwtcmVndWxhdG9yeS9jcnVpc2UtbGluZXMtNDM5bS1jbGFpbWVkLWRhbWFnZXMtdXNpbmctaGF2YW5hLXBpZXItd2lsZGx5LW92ZXJzdGF0ZWTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cruise lines $439m in damages for using Havana pier wildly overstated,"The cruise groups jointly called that claim for liability 'wildly' overstated and asked the court to dismiss the cases for lack of standing. Alternatively they argue the damages sought by Havana Docks Corp. are 'unconstitutionally excessive' or at a minimum that the underlying claim amount should be reduced because it contains elements they weren't alleged or found to have 'trafficked.'

Thanks to John Kavulich president of the US-Cuba Trade and Economic Council who alerted Seatrade Cruise News to these developments and posted excepts from the court notices plaintiff's claims and defendants' responses cited here.

Havana Docks holds a US-certified claim to a concession for a terminal and piers that were nationalized after the 1959 Cuban revolution. In 2019 the company sued Carnival Corp. Royal Caribbean Group MSC Cruises and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings under Title III of the Helms-Burton or Libertad Act which allows US nationals to seek compensation for property confiscated by Cuba's Communist government.

On March 21 US District Court Judge Beth Bloom found the companies liable. Now the court is considering claims for damages and costs.

Seeking $109.67m in damages from each company

Havana Docks is asking for $109671180.90 from each cruise company plus additional varying amounts for attorneys' fees and court costs that total nearly $11.7m.

In filings Havana Docks breaks down the damages as follows: 'With respect to Carnival Havana Docks filed its initial complaint on May 2 2019 resulting in pre-filing interest in the amount of $27377359.42. When added to the amount certified to Havana Docks by the [US Foreign Claims Settlement Commission] — $9179700.88 — it totals $36557060.30. As for MSC Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Havana Docks filed its initial complaint against each defendant on August 27 2019 resulting in pre-filing interest in the amount of $27436548.41. When added to the amount certified to Havana Docks by the FCSC it totals $36616249.29 for each of the three defendants.'

Treble damages claimed

Havana Docks believes it is entitled to treble damages. From filings: 'Where a plaintiff “owns a claim with respect to that property which was certified by the FCSC” § 6082(a)(3)(A) damages are the sum of (1) the plaintiff’s costs and reasonable attorney fees and (2) “3 times the amount determined applicable under paragraph (1)(A)(i).” § 6082(a)(3)(C). In its order on defendants’ motion to confirm interest calculation the Court ruled that the amount referred to in “paragraph (1)(A)(i)” is “the claim and the interest.”

'The amount subject to trebling in the Carnival action is therefore $36557060.30 and in each of the MSC Royal Caribbean and Norwegian actions it is $36616249.29. Thus the total amount of liability in the Carnival action is $109671180.90 (plus costs and attorneys’ fees) and the total amount in each of the MSC Royal Caribbean and Norwegian actions is $109848747.87 (plus costs and attorneys’ fees).'

Havana Docks seeks $3.46m in attorney’s fees and $223767 in costs from Carnival $2.39m in fees and $245951 in costs from MSC Cruises $2.06m in fees and $233975 in costs from Royal Caribbean and $2.82m in fees and $261002 in costs from NCLH — these amounts through Sept. 30.

Argument to base damages on concession's value only

The cruise companies jointly argue any damages should be 'substantially' less than the $439m.

From filings: 'Plaintiff has “elect[ed] to calculate its damages based on the amount of its certified claim plus interest.” Thus the Court must first determine what amount of the certified claim plaintiff could recover before applying the applicable interest. According to plaintiff the amount of the certified claim is $9179700.88. While the [FCSC] did certify $9179700.88 to plaintiff in 1960 as its “total” loss that amount includes value allocated to “securities” “accounts receivable” and “debt of the Cuban government” none of which defendants trafficked in or have been found liable for trafficking in.

'The Court found defendants liable for trafficking only in plaintiff’s confiscated property — its concession — therefore plaintiff could only ever recover the value of the concession which the FCSC certified the value to be $8684360.'

'Wildly' overstated liability

The cruise lines continue: 'To be clear even this $8684360 amount wildly overstates the appropriate amount of liability since it includes the value of two piers railroad tracks and other real and personal property that defendants did not traffic in and which plaintiff did not actually own. Defendants preserve the argument that the FCSC’s valuation is not an appropriate measure of damages. In light of the Court’s ruling against this argument however defendants argue here that even accepting the FCSC’s valuations defendants are not liable for trafficking in accounts receivable securities and debt of the Cuban government all of which were valued separately from the “Concession and tangible assets” in the FCSC’s final decision.

'To be clear by this argument defendants are not challenging the validity of the findings of the FCSC either as to ownership or valuation. But that does not mean that plaintiff is entitled to a judgment that includes the valuations of property interests in which defendants never trafficked — and indeed in which plaintiff never alleged trafficking and in which the Court did not find defendants to have trafficked.'

'Plainly disproportionate'

The cruise companies go on to state that 'regardless of whether this measure of damages would be proportionate as applied to that original act of confiscation it is plainly disproportionate in a case in which a defendant “trafficked” in confiscated property merely by making use of it for a limited period of time. This measure flouts the elementary due-process principle that a wrongdoer’s liability should be proportionate to its own culpability.

'In this case plaintiff seeks to recover $439217424.51 — far in excess of the actual amounts paid to the port operator during defendants’ use of the property which was at best closer to $22 million which means that the ratio between statutory and actual damages approaches 21:1.

'That measure would at least bear some relationship to a real-world concept: the amount a claimholder would have been able to charge if it still had an interest in (and right to exclude defendants from) the confiscated property itself.'

Collectively $22m to use the terminal plus port agent fees

The cruise companies said they paid less than $22m to Aries the port operator to use the terminal. They went on to argue that even with payments to other entities — such as Mambisa a state-owned company that acted as port agent for Carnival Royal Caribbean and NCLH and MAPOR a privately owned company that was port agent for MSC Cruises — were added to the amount for Aries the plaintiff could seek just over $30m.

The cruise companies also assert the due process analysis 'has nothing to do with the revenues or profits defendants earned from cruising which has no relevance under either the statutory framework of Helms Burton or the Due Process Clause.'

MSC said it lost millions on Cuba cruises

In their joint filing the cruise operators stated that to the extent the Court were to consider profits MSC Cruises actually lost €6.39m on its US-Cuba cruises and lost €63.57m on its Cuba-to-Cuba cruises while in its three years of sailings to Cuba NCLH's net profit 'associated with its days at port in Havana was just $25139622.'",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vZ2NhcHRhaW4uY29tL2NydWlzZS1kZW1hbmQtaGFzLXJldHVybmVkLXRvLXByZS1wYW5kZW1pYy1sZXZlbHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cruise Demand Has Returned To Pre-Pandemic Levels,"By Graham Starr

(Bloomberg) –Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. said occupancy has rebounded to pre-pandemic levels with bookings running higher than the third quarter of 2019.

The second-largest cruise operator reported third-quarter results Thursday that surpassed Wall Street estimates and said customer demand met 2019 levels for the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic shut down cruises.

“Our business is back” Chief Executive Officer Jason Liberty said in an interview. “Our load factors are in the mid-90s. We’re inching our way back.”

Occupancy for the third quarter was 96% overall beating Wall Street estimates of 92%. Adjusted profit came to 26 cents a share above the 14-cent average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue rose to $2.99 billion compared with analysts’ projections of $2.97 billion.

Royal Caribbean shares rose 8.3% to $53.77 at the close in New York the stock is down 30% this year compared with a 22% drop in the S&P 500.

The report buoyed the stocks of competitors Carnival Corp. and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. Carnival closed up 1.6% to $8.83 and Norwegian rose 3.9% to $16.99 at the close.

Despite inflationary headwinds on fuel and food Royal Caribbean said on a call that demand is strong. Its passengers tend to be high earners with median household incomes greater than $100000 and are less affected by current consumer spending challenges.

Costs are expected to rise in the fourth quarter due to fuel expense and currency exchange rates with management forecasting a loss of $1.30 to $1.50 a share. Other headwinds include a slower post-Covid rebound particularly in China where restrictions have virtually shut down travel.

“We don’t expect China to be a market for us in 2023” Liberty said.

One change since 2019: Customers are making cruise reservations much closer to their trip with 50% more bookings last quarter made for a trip in the same calendar year than in 2019. Customer demand for forward-looking trips also rose with more bookings for the following calendar year than in previous quarters.

Royal Caribbean expects record yield in 2023 with customers spending more on bookings and on cruises than they did in 2019.

Since 2018 the Republican-leaning district has been served by Republican Rep. Vance Aloupis a moderate conservative who announced in April that he was forgoing a third term to spend more time with his family.

That left HD 115 which covers the coastal municipalities of Cutler Bay Palmetto Bay Pinecrest and the unincorporated neighborhoods of The Falls Kendall and Westchester without representation.

Enter Alina García whose work history in politics spans three decades. She served as U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio’s first legislative aide when he was elected to the Florida House in 1999. Later she worked for Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis Hialeah Mayor Esteban “Steve” Bovo Miami Commissioner Joe Carollo former U.S. Rep. David Rivera and former state Sen. Frank Artiles.

Needless to say she’s seen and done a lot in The Process. She’s also raised a healthy chunk of change since filing to run for office in December 2021. Through Oct. 21 she amassed more than $638000 between her campaign account and political committee Florida Always First.

Of that she had about $179000 remaining less than a month before Election Day.

She also received more than $121000 worth of in-kind aid most of it from the Republican Party of Florida for campaign staff research polling travel photography food and beverage and phone banking expenses.

Her opponent Democratic Palmetto Bay resident Christie Cantin Davis has not received congruous support.

Cantin Davis who filed to run just weeks from the qualifying deadline has recorded no in-kind aid from the Democratic Party. Her fundraising has almost exclusively been grassroots totaling less than $13000 through late October and includes $2000 she gave herself to kick off her campaign June 9.

She had roughly that sum left by Oct. 21.

A former Republican who told the Miami Herald she grew up in a “household that revered (Ronald) Reagan” Davis ultimately switched parties and cites the overturning of Roe v. Wade as motivation to run for office this year.

She works for her brother’s health insurance company. Prior to that she served as Carnival Cruise Line’s marketing budget manager for a decade. The background each position provided would inform her role as a public policymaker well she believes.

Cantin Davis is running on a platform prioritizing women’s reproductive rights seeking sensible gun reforms supporting teachers and schools through better budget apportionments and repealing two flagship measures backed by Gov. Ron DeSantis she called “meaningless and unnecessary.”

One is the Parental Rights in Education measure which critics dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” law. It restricts classroom instruction on gender identity and sexual preference in public school classrooms.

The other law known as the Stop WOKE Act restricts classroom and workplace instruction that tells students and employees they are inherently racist or oppressed because of their race color sex or national origin among other things.

Cantin Davis has received endorsements from the Kendall Federation of Homeowner Associations the National Association of Social Workers the LGBTQ+ Democratic Caucus the Florida Leadership Council the Democratic Progressive Caucus of Florida Flamingo Democrats SAVE Action Plan and Florida Planned Parenthood.

García conversely is a self-proclaimed anti-abortion anti-communism candidate and outspoken DeSantis supporter whom she has called a “strong leader (who understands) we must build an economic environment that allows small businesses to thrive protect our coast and water supply and give our children access to the best education tools available.”

Her platform includes providing parents more control over their children’s education giving “meaningful relief” to homeowners through property insurance reform and doubling Florida’s homestead exemption from $50000 to $100000.

She also wants to permanently reduce Florida’s state gas tax give additional support to first responders and uphold the Parental Rights in Education law.

In endorsing her Rubio called García “a consensus-builder and commonsense leader who will never stop fighting for our community.” Republican House Speaker-designate Paul Renner described her as “an experienced public servant who has earned the respect of her community.”

García also has the organizational backing of the National Rifle Association the Florida House Republican Campaign Committee the Hispanic Police Officers Association the Florida Police Benevolent Association the Fraternal Order of Police the Dade County Medical Association the Florida Nurse Association the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees Associated Builders and Contractors Associated Industries of Florida and the South Florida Council of Firefighters.

Other support for García’s campaign is implied through her campaign contributions. She’s received checks from among many others Jacksonville Republican Rep. Jason Fischer Miami-Dade Commissioner Jose “Pepe” Diaz Miami-Dade Commissioner-elect Juan Carlos Bermudez Monroe County Commissioner Holly Raschein West Miami Mayor Eric Diaz-Padron South Florida Hispanic Chamber of Commerce President Liliam López and former PortMiami Director Juan Kuryla who since January has worked as senior vice president of port development for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings.

Neither García nor Cantin Davis faced Primary opponents.

Early voting runs through Nov. 6. Election Day is Nov. 8."

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 launches next week but the graphics card seems to have already been benchmarked within the CUDA OpenCL & Vulkan tests in Geekbench 5. The graphics card was benchmarked on an AMD Ryzen 9 7950X test platform featuring ASUS's ROG Crosshair X670E Extreme board & 32 GB of DDR5 memory.

In terms of performance the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 graphics card scored 300728 points in the CUDA benchmark test 248932 points in the OpenCL benchmark test and 148838 points in the Vulkan benchmark test.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 16 GB 'Official' Specifications

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 16 GB graphics card is expected to utilize a cut-down AD103-300 GPU configuration with 9728 cores or 76 SMs enabled of the total 84 units whereas the previous configuration offered 80 SMs or 10240 cores. While the full GPU comes packed with 64 MB of L2 cache and up to 224 ROPs the RTX 4080 might end up with 48 MB of L2 cache and lower ROPs too due to its cut-down design. The card is expected to be based on the PG136/139-SKU360 PCB. The graphics card is said to offer a peak clock rate of 2505 MHz.

As for memory specs the GeForce RTX 4080 is expected to rock 16 GB GDDR6X capacities that are said to be adjusted at 22.5 Gbps speeds across a 256-bit bus interface. This will provide up to 720 GB/s of bandwidth. This is still a tad bit slower than the 760 GB/s bandwidth offered by the RTX 3080 since it comes with a 320-bit interface but a lowly 10 GB capacity. To compensate for the lower bandwidth NVIDIA could be integrating a next-gen memory compression suite to make up for the 256-bit interface.

Based on the leaked performance figures it looks like the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 at $1199 US will have a tough time competing against AMD's $999 US Radeon RX 7900 XTX or even the $899 RX 7900 XT graphics cards. The graphics card launches almost a month prior to AMD's release so we won't know for sure how the performance compares until mid of December.

The suspect was identified as 24-year-old Sherod Hackett whose last known address was in Montville.

Sherod Hackett (Newington Police Department)

State police said they responded to help Newington police investigate the shooting that happened inside of O’Reilly Auto Parts on the Berlin Turnpike.

A portion of the road was closed off while police investigated.

Police said a man entered the store just before 6 p.m. on Sunday and shot two employees a pregnant woman and a man.

The victims were transported to Hartford Hospital.

Police gave an update on the victims Monday afternoon. The female victim is in stable condition and the male victim is in critical condition.

The woman told police she had encounters with the suspect before at the store.

Hackett was upset about a car part she had sold to him previously. He later called the store saying he would “show her what kind of problem they were going to have.”

The woman filed a police report and she is in stable condition.

Eyewitness News learned in court that he has a history of psychological issues.

Hackett appeared before a judge Monday in a wheelchair for his arraignment.

Eyewitnesses reported that they saw the moment officers arrived on scene.

“I wanted to know what happened. I thought something crazy happened” said Tyler Galvan of Berlin. “They had snipers riot shields all that stuff.”

They described it as an intense scene with dozens of police cars from surrounding towns and multiple drones. They searched for a suspect who at the time was on the loose.

Hartford West Hartford Bristol and Berlin Police assisted.

The suspect was caught and taken into custody around 8:45 p.m. on Coronado Drive after calls came in from people in the neighborhood.

“It shook up the whole neighborhood because we are a quiet neighborhood here. We’ve never had anything like this happen” said Tanya Okumura of Newington.

Neighbors in a condo complex said Hackett knocked on a couple residents doors before the cops were called.

“I thought to myself ‘what if I was home and opened the door and this happened to me.’ I probably would have panicked and probably wouldn’t have done the right thing” Okumura said.

The suspect rang the doorbell of a woman’s condo.

She spoke to Eyewitness News but didn’t want to show her face.

“He had stated to me that he had an argument with his girlfriend and that he was looking to see if I could help him get a taxi or an uber ride. So he can get home. Something kind of just didn’t feel right. I went back inside my house and my daughter stated to me that it just seemed kind of off” the woman said.

Police have not revealed if they know what led up to the shooting.

Hackett was held on a $1.5 million bond. He was expected to appear in court following his release from the hospital.

Two people were hurt and one person was arrested following a shooting at an auto parts store in Newington over the weekend.

Police say 1 person is under arrest after shooting 2 people inside a business on the Berlin Turnpike.

State police said they responded to assist Newington police regarding a shooting inside O’Reilly Auto Parts on the Berlin Turnpike.

OXY,Occidental Petroleum,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vbWFya2V0cy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL25ld3Mvc3RvY2tzL29jY2lkZW50YWwtcGV0cm9sZXVtLW55c2Utb3h5LXEzLXByZXZpZXctaGVyZS1zLXdoYXQtdG8tZXhwZWN0LTEwMzE4ODA2MDjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) Q3 Preview: Here's What to Expect,"Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) will announce its Q3 financial results on November 8. Like other energy companies higher year-over-year oil prices will drive earnings growth in Q3. However on a sequential basis OXY’s earnings will decline as oil prices have moderated in the recent past on account of economic uncertainty. Nevertheless momentum in the OxyChem segment will cushion its bottom line.

In Q2 average worldwide realized crude oil prices jumped 17% from the prior quarter. Moreover the prices of natural gas liquids (NGL) grew by about 6%. Higher prices drove OXY’s pre-tax income in the Oil and Gas segment. Further the higher realized pricing and solid demand drove record earnings in its OxyChem business.

WTI (West Texas Intermediate) and Brent crude prices per barrel have moderated to nearly $90 in Q3 from over $108/barrel in Q2. Given the decline analysts expect OXY to report earnings of $2.48 a share in Q3 compared to $3.16 in Q2.

Against this background let’s take a look at what analysts recommend on OXY stock ahead of Q3.

Is OXY a Buy Right Now?

OXY stock has outperformed most energy companies in 2022. It has delivered a year-to-date gain of about 153% compared to the increases of 84% and 56% in Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) stock respectively.

However given the moderation in oil prices OXY stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on four Buy and seven Hold recommendations. Further its average price target of $75.80 implies a 3.5% upside potential.

OXY stock has positive signals from hedge funds and insiders who accumulated its stock last quarter. Further Occidental Petroleums stock has an Outperform Smart Score of “Perfect 10.”

Bottom Line

The moderation in oil and gas prices amid uncertainty could lead to a sequential decline in its earnings in Q3 and limit the upside in OXY stock. Further Occidentals stock is trading at an enterprise value-to-EBITDA multiple of 5.11 which is roughly at par with the peer group average.

Berkshire Hathaway reported a quarterly loss on Saturday of USD 2.7 billion or USD 1832 per Class A share.

That's down from a USD 10.3 billion profit or USD 6882 per Class A share a year ago when the stock market was soaring. In the second quarter of this year Berkshire reported a USD44 billion loss.

Buffett has long said he believes Berkshire's operating earnings are a better measure of the company's performance because they exclude investment gains and losses which can vary widely quarter to quarter.

By that measure Berkshire's operating earnings jumped 20per cent to USD 7.76 billion or USD 5293.83 per Class A share. That's up from USD6.47 billion or USD 4330.60 per Class A share.

The four analysts surveyed by FactSet expected Berkshire to report operating earnings per Class A share of USD 4205.82 on average.

Berkshire said its revenue grew 9 per cent to USD 76.9 billion.

Most of Berkshire's eclectic assortment of more than 90 companies performed well during the quarter but the key insurance unit of Geico reported a pre-tax underwriting loss of USD 759 million as the cost of auto claims soared along with the prices of used cars and car parts.

Geico has been hampered by soaring costs since the second half of last year.

Geico did increase its rates by 5.4 per cent during the quarter but that was almost entirely offset because it lost 4.6per cent of its customers.

Another notable weak spot in the results was that BNSF railroad's profit declined 6per cent to USD 1.44 billion as it hauled 5 per cent less freight the cost of fuel soared and salary costs were adjusted up to reflect the raises railroads have agreed to pay their workers in tentative agreements with their 12 unions.

Most of BNSF's peers reported significant increases in profits during the quarter.

Berkshire said its insurance units recorded after tax losses of USD 2.7 billion related to Hurricane Ian.

That compares with USD 1.7 billion in catastrophic losses a year ago related to Hurricane Ida and major floods in Europe.

Berkshire is sitting on nearly USD 109 billion cash even though it has been actively investing in the stock market this year including putting more than USD 51 billion to work in the first quarter.

That is up slightly from the USD 105.4 billion it held at the end of the second quarter because Berkshire's businesses generated more cash than it spent. Although after the end of the third quarter Berkshire did spend USD 11.6 billion in October to complete its acquisition of the Alleghany insurance conglomerate.

Buffett's biggest stock investments this year included buying roughly USD 12 billion worth of Occidental Petroleum stock and about USD 20 billion worth of Chevron shares.

Besides those oil sector investments Berkshire also bought more than 120 million shares of printer maker HP Inc. and bet big that Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard will go through by buying nearly 70 million shares of the video game maker.

Berkshire's investment portfolio also includes major stakes in Apple American Express Bank of America and Coca-Cola stock.

The Omaha Nebraska based conglomerate's companies include manufacturing firms like aviation parts maker Precision Castparts and specialty chemical maker Lubrizol retail firms like See's Candy Dairy Queen and Helzberg Diamonds and other companies like NetJets."

In other areas it looked like it was their first game together.

The Eagles overcame some miscues and weathered multiple Old Dominion runs beating the Monarchs 81-62 to open the regular season Monday night at Alico Arena. With the win FGCU has now won four straight regular-season openers.

""It's good to start off with a win"" FGCU coach Karl Smesko said. ""We're beating a really good program. Both teams have a lot of new players so I think it's good to play good competition for the first game. It shows you a lot of things you need to work on and I think Old Dominion showed us a few things that we're going to have to get better at in a short period of time.

""Hopefully our players see some of the things we're talking about that put us in a situation where they went on a couple runs at us. We'll learn from it we'll get better.""

FGCU and Old Dominion struggled in the opening quarter as defense dominated. Despite being slightly undersized inside the Monarch forwards could never establish a presence inside.

As a team FGCU surrendered just 22 points in the paint and limited Jada Duckett and Brenda Fontana to just two points on 0-for-4 shooting. FGCU outrebounded Old Dominion 42-32.

""I think we have some good post defenders"" Smesko added. ""We've got some new players who are still learning technique but they're willing to fight in there and they're actually really quick to where they can make some plays on post entry. We knew they'd want to pound inside and if not drive it hard inside. There's times we looked really good and other times there were defensive breakdowns we'd have to address.""

The Eagles built a sizeable second-quarter lead going on a 23-4 run. From there Old Dominion would get in striking distance but could never get within one score for the remainder of the game.

""We were getting the ball out in transition"" Smesko said. ""We were scoring in transition. We're a very fast team. We have to put some pressure in conversion. We didn't shoot the ball great tonight but we hit a couple of 3's we got excited. Then it was a nice stretch for us.

""There were a couple of runs where we went on a 10-2 and then we gave up a few of those making some errors guarding ball screens and giving up easy shots.""

FGCU takeaways

1. TK hits 1K. Standout guard TK Morehouse in her third season with FGCU eclipsed 1000 career points with the Eagles on a contested layup which she made falling down. Morehouse finished the night with 24 points on 9-of-13 shooting with four assists and a pair of rebounds to lead the team as she'll arguably be the alpha after Kierstan Bell's departure to the WNBA.

""It was exciting but I was locked in on the win"" Morehouse said. ""We were only up by 10 points. I was focused on getting that first win in that first game getting the jitters out. I think it's exciting to hit that milestone.""

2. New transfer makes an immediate impact. Alyza Winston a transfer from Michigan State found her footing off the bench in her FGCU debut as she finished with 22 points on 7-for-13 shooting. Of the eight bench players Smesko rotated in Winston's 26 minutes were the highest. Uju Ezeudu finished with 10 points and six rebounds across 18 minutes of action.

""I definitely missed it"" Winston said. ""I haven't played since December so it was great to get back out there. It's a completely new system with completely new players so we're just trying to get to know each other and to play to each other's strengths. I think we created a lot of good shots for each other so it was a lot of fun.""

3. Long road trip ahead. The Eagles won't play inside Alico Arena for nearly a month as a trip to FIU is slated for Sunday before the team travels to Honolulu to play in the Bank of Hawai'i Classic as well as the Rainbow Wahine Showdown.

""... We're going to have a few days to get better"" Smesko said. ""It's always good to win. Now can we learn from a win? Can we understand that even though we won the game and beat a good team that there's a lot of things that need to be much better if we want to keep winning. It's good to have a home opener and it's great to be in front of our fans again. They were loud and into it. It was fun to get another season started.""

Morich a first-team all-conference player completed her hat trick at an opportune time.

The sixth-seeded Monarchs (9-8-3) who won the Conference USA tourney last season and gained their second consecutive automatic bid to the NCAA’s 64-team bracket will learn their first-round assignment in a show on NCAA.com at 2 p.m. Monday.

JMU (12-4-5) only had allowed eight goals all season but ODU grabbed a 2-0 lead on goals by Morich in the first minute and Megan Watts in the 12th.

An ODU foul in the box set up a Hannah Young penalty kick in the 43rd minute reducing the Monarchs’ halftime lead to 2-1.

Morich scored in the 47th minute to make it 3-1 but Amanda Attanasi got loose on a breakaway pass from Young to pull the Dukes to 3-2 in the 49th minute. An ODU hand-ball in the box enabled JMU’s Sophia Verrecchia to net a tying penalty kick in the 58th but neither team scored again until Morich’s game winner amid sliding traffic in front of JMU goalkeeper Alexandra Blom. That avenged ODU’s 1-0 regular-season loss to the fourth-seeded Dukes whom the Monarchs outshot 15-12 Sunday.

Unbeaten CNU women repeat C2C title

Defending NCAA Division III women’s soccer champion Christopher Newport defended its Coast-To-Coast Athletic Conference title with a 1-0 win over Mary Washington (12-5-4) in the tournament championship match Sunday at Captains Field.

Senior midfielder Emily Talotta scored the winning goal with a shot from 19 yards with 21 minutes 33 seconds remaining in the second half. She gathered a pass on a free kick from midfielder Abby Harrigan and made a long run to the top of the penalty box before blasting her shot inside the right post.

“Abby looked at me and I looked at her and she played me the ball really quickly” Talotta said. “I took a touch inside to beat my defender and then kind of panicked for a minute because I typically don’t shoot or score.

“I got the touch and some space so I took the shot and it happened.”

The defense of Jill McDonald Nansemond River High graduate Sarah Rhiel Nyah Savage Re Slater and goalkeeper Jaya Daniel was impenetrable as always allowing a goal or fewer for the17th time in 18 games. The Captains (16-0-2) — unbeaten in 41 matches the past two seasons and ranked third nationally — will play in the first round of the NCAA Tournament next weekend opponent and site to be revealed in Monday’s 1:30 p.m. selection show on NCAA.com.

“It wasn’t easy because we’ve been thrown a lot of curveballs this season” CNU coach Jamie Gunderson said of numerous injuries to key players. “I can’t speak more highly of this group of players.

“They just show up and want to win. This was one of our goals to repeat and we did and it’s fantastic.”

Virginia Wesleyan women fall to Lynchburg in shootout

Lynchburg won the Old Dominion Athletic Conference Tournament by edging Virginia Wesleyan 5-4 in penalty kicks after their 1-1 draw through 110 minutes at the Tassos Paphites Soccer Complex in Virginia Beach.

The Hornets landed an automatic NCAA bid while the 2021 ODAC champion Marlins (15-2-3) hope for an at-large berth when the field is revealed at 2 p.m. Monday.

Megan Dee put fourth-seeded Lynchburg ahead in the 66th minute but Olivia Bryant netted the tying goal in the 79th off an Alexis Miller assist for third-seeded VWU.

The shootout lasted seven rounds the final two of which were sudden-victory. The Hornets made their last three kicks and Lynchburg keeper Jade Lecklider dove to her right to set off a celebration with her save of a final try by VWU goalkeeper Rachel Quigley. Both of them were credited with four saves.

CNU men drop C2C shootout seek at-large bid

Christopher Newport lost a thriller in penalty kicks in the Coast-To-Coast Athletic Conference final in Salisbury Maryland but has a realistic chance to advance to the Division III championship bracket anyway.

Gadsoni Abel netted a kick with 17 seconds left in regulation to give Mary Washington (9-4-3) the nation’s No. 18 team a 1-0 lead and seemingly the title. But the 12th-ranked Captains (12-3-2) immediately attacked after the kickoff and scored when Owen Burnett looped a last-ditch header into the net as the clock hit triple zeroes forcing overtime.

After 20 scoreless minutes penalty kicks began. Tied at 3 after five rounds the shootout went to the sudden-victory phase. CNU’s Ethan Larson made a save to give Burnett a chance to win the title but UMW keeper Griffin Hemmendinger saved his shot. The Eagles’ Abel Luwis then scored before Hemmendinger made a game-ending save of Jonathon Leiding for a 1-1 (6-5) victory.

UMW gained the C2C’s automatic bid and the Captains will find out in Monday’s 1:30 p.m. show on NCAA.com whether they will join the Eagles in the tournament. CNU was No. 1 in the NCAA’s most recent regional rankings.

ODU men ousted by Georgia State in Sun Belt quarterfinal

Old Dominion’s season ended in a 3-1 Sun Belt quarterfinal defeat to Georgia State in Huntington West Virginia.

The sixth-seeded Monarchs (6-8-3) dropped their final four games including two to the third-seeded Panthers (12-3-3) in a five-day span. But ODU took a 1-0 lead in the 26th minute when Fabian Rieser headed in Karan Mandair’s curling free kick.

Georgia State goalkeeper Gunther Rankenburg yielded nothing else making nine saves. Meanwhile his teammates tormented ODU keeper Michael Statham and company.

Max Wilkins tied the game less than two minutes after Rieser’s goal. Then in the 37th minute Gavin Williams knocked in the go-ahead goal. About two minutes after that Jack Hilton-Jones’ goal made it 3-1.

ODU outshot the Panthers 15-6 in the second half and 20-16 for the game but couldn’t catch up.

Cox High graduate’s goal leads JMU to Sun Belt tourney upset

Cox High graduate Clay Obara scored in the 44th minute and James Madison held on to post a 1-0 upset Marshall the nation’s No. 5 team in a Sun Belt Tournament quarterfinal in Huntington West Virginia.

The seventh-seeded Dukes (7-7-4) advanced to a semifinal Wednesday in Huntington against third-seeded Georgia State. Marshall (10-3-3) seeded second seems like a certain choice for an NCAA at-large berth.

Obara a redshirt junior slid in the box to redirect teammate Cameron Arnold’s back-heel crossing pass for the goal. The Thundering Herd outshot JMU 10-2 in the second half but freshman Sebastian Conlon earned his fifth shutout of the season behind one spectacular save.

UVA blanks Pitt to reach ACC semifinals

Holden Brown made a career-high nine saves as Virginia defeated Pittsburgh 1-0 at Klöckner Stadium in an ACC quarterfinal.

The third-seeded Cavaliers (10-4-3) ranked 14th nationally recorded their eighth shutout of the year and ousted sixth-seeded and 24th-ranked Pittsburgh (8-4-5) in the rain.

Reese Miller scored in the 21st minute. Daniel Mangarov hit a diagonal pass to Leo Afonso who set up Miller for the decisive shot.

UVA next will play a semifinal Wednesday at No. 2 Syracuse which beat seventh-seeded North Carolina 1-0.

Deacons eliminate Hokies

Virginia Tech meanwhile saw its season end with a 1-0 quarterfinal loss at Wake Forest.

The 12th-seeded Hokies who went through the regular season without an ACC win upended fifth-seeded Louisville to gain a trip to Winston-Salem North Carolina. But the fourth-seeded Demon Deacons (14-4) beat the Hokies (3-14-1) on Omar Hernandez’s goal in the 62nd minute. He curled a free kick around the wall and into the net’s top left corner.

HARRISONBURG Va. (WHSV) - James Madison football returns to Sun Belt play on Saturday when the Dukes face Old Dominion.

The Dukes have never beaten the Monarchs. However these teams have not met since 2012 when Old Dominion recorded a 38-28 victory.

In its first year in the Sun Belt Conference JMU has already battled Old Dominion in multiple sports. This past weekend the women’s soccer Dukes dropped a double-overtime heartbreaker against the Monarchs in the Sun Belt Championship.

On Saturday all eyes will be on the football field as the Dukes face the Monarchs in a matchup dubbed the Royal Rivalry.

“People who support our program believe that this is a really big game” said James Madison head coach Curt Cignetti. “We’re in-state rivals we compete in recruiting... it is a really big game. I’m sure it will be a great rivalry down the road.”

Both teams are coming off three consecutive losses. The Dukes dropped last weekend’s contest against ACC team Louisville a game that saw JMU quarterback Todd Centeio go 4-of-15 for 52 yards and no touchdowns.

Cignetti said the Dukes are focused on the next test as they try to maintain a winning record in the Sun Belt Conference. James Madison started the season with five consecutive wins but have now dropped to 5-3 including a 3-2 mark in Sun Belt play.

“You have to shake it off in athletics” said Cignetti. “We have a lot to play for and our guys will be ready.”

The Dukes take on Old Dominion on Saturday at 1 p.m. on the road. This game will be streamed live on ESPN+.

FOLEY Ala. – The No. 6 seed Monarchs from Old Dominion defeated the No. 4 seed Dukes from James Madison 4-3 in overtime to capture their first Sun Belt Conference title.



In its first year in the league Old Dominion (9-8-3) captured its first Sun Belt title with the win to send the Monarchs to their second consecutive NCAA Tournament appearance. They will find out their postseason fate on Monday November 7 with the selection show at 2:30 p.m. CT.



Carla Morich provided the fireworks in the match as the senior from Hamburg Germany tallied the hat trick and game-winner in the 106th minute for the Monarchs. Morich was also named the 2022 Sun Belt Tournament’s Most Outstanding Performer.



Nine of the 10 matches at the 2022 Sun Belt Women’s Soccer Tournament were decided by one or fewer goals.



Old Dominion got on the board first as Morich scored her first goal of the match just 38 seconds into the championship bout. Megan Watts picked up the assist on Morich’s sixth goal of the year. 10 minutes later Watts earned a goal of her own to put Old Dominion ahead 2-0.



James Madison (12-4-5) was awarded a penalty kick two minutes before the half as Hannah Young converted from the spot to put the Dukes down 2-1 at the break.



Morich came out firing in the second half for her second goal of the match just 1:47 after the whistle with an assist from Andrea Balcazar Algarin to give the Monarchs a commanding 3-1 lead. James Madison answered a minute later as Attanasi scored her ninth goal of the season after a through ball from Hannah Young to cut the lead to one.



The Dukes were presented with another penalty kick opportunity in the 58th minute as Sophia Verrecchia scored her fifth goal of the year from the spot to tie the match at three. Both teams had chances but the match was sent to overtime for the fifth time in the tournament.



James Madison recorded the lone shot of the first overtime as the score remained 3-3. Morich scored the match-winner in the 106th minute to give Old Dominion the win and tournament title.

MARKETING-INTERACTIVE has reached out to Deterjen Sayang for comment.The ad located in Pekalongan Central Java contained images of the bras and panties resulting in complaints from the public. According to authorities the advertiser didn't have a permit to have it installed.

https://www.facebook.com/pekalonganinfo/photos/a.1992717624348481/3581993632087531/

The acting head of the municipal police of Pekalongan Regency Budi Rahardjo said his team would usually remove the ads themselves but in this instance the owner of the ad wanted to remove it from the billboard himself. Just a month before this advertisement case the Pekalongan Regency shared the details on its official Facebook page that advertisers need to go to its office and seek permission for installing advertisements or banners - from its office itself.

Separately there have been other cases outside of Indonesia where displaying of women's undergarments - or lack there of- have been called out by advertising bodies and the public.

Last year Adidas' sports bra ads featuring bare-breasted women has been called out by Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) and a ban has been put in place after investigations into the ads began. The ads published in February featured a tweet of a photo grid of 25 pairs of bare breasts along with a couple of images of women’s backs after wearing sports bras as well as two posters featuring a similar grid and a cropped version of individual ladies. The campaign also came with the tagline #SupportisEverything. The ad campaign was done in collaboration with Omnicom Group's TBWA.

Some complainants considered the ads' use of nudity as gratuitous as they objectified women by sexualising them to body parts. They challenged whether they were harmful and offensive. Meanwhile other complainants challenged if the poster ads were appropriate for display as they could be seen by children.

In Malaysia feminine hygiene brand Libresse withdrew an ad from various channels and explained that it was not the brand's intention to offend any woman or the community. The campaign in question was its V-Kebaya Limited Edition range which brought to life V-Zone confidence and femininity through a modern interpretation of the Nyonya kebaya floral designs. Done in collaboration with creative agency Muma Malaysia the brand reimagined the Nyonya kebaya chrysanthemum and peony designs with the vulva as the heart of the floral embroidery.

Packaging—one of the final steps in semiconductor manufacturing—places chips in a protective case to prevent corrosion and to provide the interface that can combine and connect already made chips. To drive U.S. leadership in the $ 30.4 billion advanced semiconductor packaging market the CHIPS and Science Act signed into law in August 2022 calls on the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) to establish a National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program (NAPMP). This follows the June 2021 100-day supply chain review ordered by the Biden administration of the risk posed by U.S. reliance on China and Taiwan for semiconductor packaging processes. Understanding these developments requires a closer look at the landscape for assembly testing and packaging (ATP).



The ATP Landscape



Semiconductor Packaging is an extremely labor-intensive process. To take advantage of lower wages and input costs at least 81 percent of the world’s ATP production is located in Asia according to the Boston Consulting Group and the Semiconductor Industry Association. There are two prevailing business models in the ATP market: Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDM) provide all semiconductor packaging processes in-house while Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (OSAT) companies specialize in outsourced testing and assembly operations.



Currently U.S. semiconductor firms offshore nearly all packaging processes to OSAT companies or rely on IDM facilities owned by U.S. companies that are located overseas. For example Apple which has a major chip design operation in the U.S. has an estimated $44.95 billion deal with Taiwanese semiconductor company ASE for ATP processes. According to the Bloomberg Terminal database other U.S. semiconductor manufacturers including Intel Micron and OnSemiconductor also rely on major East Asian OSAT firms. In 2021 SEMI and Techsearch published a new edition of the Worldwide Assembly & Test Facility Database which found that there were 373 total OSATs facilities worldwide in 2021 most of which were located in Asia with 111 in China and 107 in Taiwan. Meanwhile only 46 facilities were located in the U.S.



Similarly for IDM facilities the U.S. is dependent on China Taiwan and other Asian countries. For example Texas Instruments one of the leading global IDM companies in the U.S. has zero test and assembly/development facilities in the U.S. and transports all semiconductors that it manufactures in the U.S. to companies outside the U.S. for packaging. Meanwhile Intel another leading global IDM company based in the U.S. has only one such facility. As a result Intel and Texas Instruments are 75 percent and 85 percent dependent on Asia respectively for ATP processes with each company conducting about 30 percent of its packaging in China and Taiwan. This heavy reliance on companies in Asia especially in China and Taiwan is a weakness in the U.S. supply chain.



Amid growing Chinese assertiveness in technology policy and the disruptions in chip supply associated with the COVID-19 pandemic a number of government and industry leaders are raising concerns about the exposure of the U.S. to supply disruptions in critical technologies. The NIST National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program represents a significant response to address this vulnerability.



Sustaining Moore’s Law



Packaging research is also seen as a way to remain on the cutting edge of semiconductor innovation. Historically semiconductor research has focused on increasing the number of components on a single chip (“chip density”) in order to innovate smaller higher performance and multifunctional semiconductors. Companies such as Intel TSMC and Samsung compete on commercializing smaller ever more advanced chips sustaining Moore’s Law. As the technology bumps against the laws of physics however the quest for smaller chips is expected to yield less and less impact in terms of efficiency gains.



Innovations in chip packaging can raise the performance of electronic devices as well as lower the power consumption of chips. A focus on driving innovations in advanced packaging rather than just chip density can help make the U.S. semiconductor industry more competitive.



The National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program



NAPMP is tasked with building a robust domestic advanced packaging capability in the U.S. The CHIPS and Science Act also known as CHIPS+ appropriates $11 billion over five years for research and development programs including an initial $2.5 billion for the establishment of the NAPMP.



Under the NAPMP NIST will bring together industry and academia to carry out shared research and innovation in high-performance space-saving and multi-functional packaging. This facility will provide companies with access to critical shared research infrastructure that will enable firms to test new advanced packaging approaches and processes and integrate them into their business models. This infrastructure would otherwise be too expensive and technologically difficult to install and operate independently. This effort is similar to those that Japan has been carrying out to boost its domestic semiconductor industry.



Future Steps



Although the U.S. government has approved a once-in-a-generation investment in advanced manufacturing NAPMP is only expected to be a first step. Additional policy action will be needed to ensure U.S. leadership in semiconductors. Among other actions the U.S. can:

Encourage U.S.-based Packaging: U.S. policymakers can encourage domestic and foreign semiconductor companies to establish new IDM and OSAT packaging facilities in the United States within the framework of the Semiconductor Financial Assistance Program (SFAP). The SFAP is a $39 billion subsidy program established in CHIPS+ to expand semiconductor manufacturing research packaging equipment and materials capabilities in the U.S.

Maintain Long-term Support from the Public: The U.S. government must manage the public’s short-term expectations as well as win long-term support from the public for the NAPMP.

Semiconductor packaging has been outsourced and cultivated abroad in China Taiwan and other East Asian countries in the past decades. However emerging national security concerns and technological innovations in semiconductor packaging have led to a reevaluation of the global semiconductor supply chain and the importance of innovations in semiconductor packaging for maintaining further improvements in semiconductors. The National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program along with complementary initiatives can help secure U.S. leadership in semiconductor research and production.

The conventional electronic device design process utilizes a well-established approach: materials with known properties tested device structures and designer experience have led to the manufacturing of a variety of semiconductor devices critical to our daily life. Under this conventional process new devices must fit the desired application into these established parameters. With the help of advanced physics-informed machine learning (PIML) techniques however BU ECE researchers are setting out to transform the status-quo and develop a new paradigm in which novel semiconductor materials and device structure are designed to satisfy specific requirements rather than the opposite. In this context ultra-wide-bandgap semiconductors (UWBGs) are ideal test candidates.

Professor Enrico Bellotti’s (ECE MSE) collaborative team includes researchers from the Universities of Utah and Notre Dame as well as BU ECE colleague Professor Luca Dal Negro (ECE MSE) . With the support of a $2.5M grant from the Army Research Office they plan to demonstrate that their AI/Machine Learning-augmented theoretical approach and experimental validation methodology under the title AI/ML Augmented Materials And Device Exploration (AI/ML-MADE) can deliver an impressive result: ultra-wide-bandgap semiconductor devices capable of operating in the millimeter-wave frequency spectrum (necessary to achieve the high-capacity transmissions which fuel 5G communications among other applications) with 10 times the power density currently available via conventionally-designed devices.

To accomplish this the team will tackle two problems simultaneously: the development of novel materials from which to build their devices and designing new device architectures to utilize them. Machine learning approaches will be applied to the task of identifying material combinations that will yield the desired attributes. For example enhancing channel charge density by controlling piezoelectric characteristics and increasing operating voltages by modifying the high-field carrier transport properties will lead to a higher power generated for a given device size.

In addition to focusing on millimeter-wave devices with such enhanced performance Professor Bellotti and Dal Negro’s project will build a foundation for ongoing research towards novel more powerful and efficient devices that will affect applications well beyond radio frequency electronics such as optoelectronics and photonics. Furthermore the research program will be enhanced by the involvement of faculty post-doctoral researchers and students from different institutions across the country and national laboratories.

Professor Enrico Bellotti is a prolific researcher with a focus on computational electronics parallel computing and semiconductor materials and device simulations. He earned his PhD from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1999 and is a member of the IEEE and life-members of International Society for Optics and Photonics (SPIE). Prof. Bellotti is also the lead-PI of the Center for Semiconductor Materials and Device Modelling (CSM) and the director of the industry consortium associated to the center.

Professor Luca Dal Negro received his PhD from the University of Trento in Italy in 2003 and is an OSA fellow. His research interests include nano-optics and metamaterials nonlinear and quantum optics and advanced imaging and multifunctional optical devices.

(Rendering courtesy of Micron)

The computer memory chip specialist Micron has launched a plan to create an enormous manufacturing complex in the town of Clay N.Y. north of Syracuse by investing $31 billion to build four 600000-sq.-ft. ""clean rooms"" on the site Spectrum News 1 in Syracuse reported.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul noted that the Onondaga County facility roughly 40 football fields in size will make it one of the largest construction projects in North America. In addition the project is expected to create 5600 related construction jobs according to a news release from her office.

The semiconductor chip factory is slated to be constructed in Clay's White Pine Commerce Park. With it comes the potential for bringing tens of thousands of jobs to the region U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer said during a news conference unveiling the project in October.

In all Micron will invest $100 billion over 20 years which according to Schumer is the largest private investment in New York state history and is set to provide 50000 jobs throughout the area with 9000 working directly for the company. The average starting salary for a Micron employee is $109000 he added.

Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra noted that when fully built the plant will produce nearly four billion chips a year.

He credited President Joe Biden as well as the federal CHIPS and Science Act authored by Schumer for setting the foundation for the plant. The measure designed to revitalize domestic manufacturing and strengthen supply chains was signed into law by the President in August.

""The combined efforts at the federal state and local level paved the way for Micron to realize the largest private investment ever made in New York state history"" Mehrotra said. ""We are thrilled to make this significant investment in New York making the Empire State the location of the biggest leading-edge memory site in the U.S.""

Micron employs 48000 people in 17 countries and is the fourth largest semiconductor company in the world.

""We chose this location for many reasons but most importantly — central New York offers a rich pool of diverse talent including communities that traditionally have been underrepresented in technology jobs"" Mehrotra told Spectrum News 1.

The White Pine Commerce Park is a 1200-acre site near Caughdenoy Road and New York Highway 31. Site preparation for the Micron complex is going to begin in 2023 followed by the start of heavy construction in 2024 the news outlet learned.

On a visit to Syracuse Oct. 27 President Biden pointed to Micron's decision to build the major semiconductor facility in the region as a harbinger of what is to come.

""A century ago this region was the heartland of manufacturing and now the region is poised to lead the world in advanced manufacturing"" Biden remarked from the stage at Onondaga Community College's SRC Arena and Event Center.

""We're here to celebrate one of the most significant investments in American history and it's going to ensure that the future is made in America"" he continued. ""It's part of a broader story of the economy we're building that will work for everyone.""

Call Goes Out for Tech Construction Jobs

The building of a semiconductor fabrication or chip fab campus employing thousands of high-paying tech jobs will undoubtedly lift the region's fortunes in a way not seen for decades national experts told Syracuse.com the online edition of the Post-Standard newspaper.

But there is one major obstacle that could slow that progress: Who will fill all those jobs?

The work of a chip fab — etching eight billion tiny transistors onto a silicon memory chip the size of a fingernail — is specialized to put it mildly. That does not mean it requires a Ph.D. but every position requires some level of specialized training.

Even the construction jobs to build the facilities require special training.

That means high schools community colleges and universities working in unison to prepare students for careers at Micron and related businesses said Mike Russo president and CEO at the National Institute for Innovation and Technology a government-funded nonprofit that facilitates work force development for semiconductor companies.

""They should look at it as a generational change for that region and really bring together a concerted effort to develop that talent pipeline"" he noted.

Even before the new fab clean rooms are built experts see some potential for a shortage of construction workers capable of overseeing work on them.

Micron's site in Clay will provide plenty of jobs for local building trades but they will have to be trained and supervised by specialists who are familiar with the complexities of building a fab said Joe Stockunas president of SEMI Americas part of SEMI a global trade group representing semiconductor manufacturers and suppliers.

But those specialists are in limited supply he told Syracuse.com.

Equipment in a fabrication plant is expensive and highly sensitive Stockunas said. One of the key tools a lithography system for putting integrated circuits on the chips costs about $150 million. Any buildings housing them must be built and outfitted to exacting standards.

""I don't know anything that competes with this level of precision"" he admitted. ""The welders the pipe fitters the construction trades they're all going to go through some sort of a training program and then be supervised by folks who understand the complexities of what has to be done special.""

More than 10 years ago at the height of construction at Global Foundries a chip fab in nearby Saratoga County employed more than 3500 workers on site and the company was spending $4.4 million a day on wages and materials. Russo who worked for Global Foundries before founding his nonprofit said there will be more competition now for workers to build fabs.

""If you are used to building an office building or a house that's different than building a semiconductor fab"" he noted. ""There are definitely different skill sets involved.""

New Infrastructure Also Needed Around Clay N.Y.

The Syracuse area and the northern suburbs could experience rapid growth from the Micron endeavor. Now is the time to start planning for that advised Dennis Brobston president of the Saratoga Economic Development Corp. which helped lure Global Foundries to the small rural town of Malta.

""It's all about traffic"" he added.

Even now 13 years after Global Foundries broke ground for its $15 billion facility the Malta area suffers from unanticipated traffic congestion on certain roads and intersections he said.

Congestion is already prevalent on N.Y. 31 in and around the Micron property. State transportation officials have committed to spend $200 million on road and infrastructure improvements around the fab site said Ryan McMahon an executive with Onondaga County.

""Traffic will actually get better because of the improvements that will have to be made"" McMahon explained to Syracuse.com.

In addition central New York will need more housing Brobston said more hotels for construction workers and others with temporary assignments at the chip factory as well as new daycare facilities and schools.

Micron's semiconductor facility in Clay is likely to draw employees from abroad too at least in the early years. When the plant starts production as early as 2025 many of the first employees will be experienced staff from other fabs Stockunas told the Syracuse news source. Most of Micron's manufacturing facilities are in Asia.

""They'll definitely be bringing in experienced folks"" he said.

Memory Chips Heart of Everyday Technology

Semiconductors help convert power from a standard outlet into the electricity needed for any given electronic device. They are found in many everyday devices from smartphones to appliances to vehicles.

Micron manufactures chips for computer memory and storage uses like memory cards and solid-state drives.

The ability to use voice-to-text technology on your smartphone advanced safety features in your car and precise medical imaging in doctor's offices depend on fast and accurate data Mehrotra said at the SRC Arena.

Work in the memory space makes access to data easy and therefore it is ""at the heart of all of these technology applications today"" he said. ""We are the clear technology leader in memory and we're now bringing that leadership in technology and manufacturing excellence to right here in Clay New York.""

During the COVID-19 pandemic demand soared for semiconductors also referred to as ""chips"" and the United States scrambled to strengthen domestic manufacturing to stave off consumers' dependence on imported chips from overseas.

Governor Maru Campos Galván held meetings in the U.S. with Intel Boeing and other companies to promote Chihuahua as an attractive destination for foreign investment as the state seeks to move up in the supply chain. The goal is to build on the region’s traditional strength in auto parts and electronics which helped position Chihuahua as Mexico’s largest goods exporter to the U.S. The state currently exports more than US $58 billion worth of goods a year to its northern neighbor.

In the meetings Governor Campos assured companies that Chihuahua is ready to welcome foreign companies with incentive packages through an economic policy aimed at strengthening a diverse range of manufacturers including the semiconductor and aerospace industries. To date Chihuahua is home to 15% of aerospace manufacturing in Mexico.

To attract investment the local government has pushed talent development strategies the strengthening of local suppliers and the promotion of innovation and applied technology. “I want to be the spark plug of the US-Mexico border” Campos said in an interview with Bloomberg on Monday as part of her tour in Washington D.C.

Joining the meetings was Mexico’s ambassador to the U.S. Esteban Moctezuma who said that benefiting from its strategic location bordering the U.S. Chihuahua plays a key role in the relationship between Mexico and the U.S. and its common goal of promoting economic regional growth.

In September the U.S. encouraged Mexico to offer incentives that bring chipmakers to North America from Asia as both nations try to expand the production of semiconductors — an industry that according to the consulting firm McKinsey is projected to become a trillion dollar sector by 2030.

The ambassador added that Chihuahua forms part of a highly integrated region with Texas and New Mexico connected with efficient state-of-the-art ports of entry railways and airports. The position offers a unique manufacturing and logistics platform to compete in the global market he said.

The meetings were held as part of the state government’s “Chihuahua Month” in the U.S. which drew representatives from Intel HP Honeywell Boeing and Bombardier.

""I think you will see Japan and Netherlands follow our lead"" U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on CNBC Thursday. While no specifics were mentioned this appears to be the first time that a high-ranking U.S. official has named specific countries when speaking about cooperation on the export curbs."

National Grid’s lawsuit against Wipro its system integrator was eventually settled out of court for $75 million but that didn’t come close to covering the losses.

10. Worth & Co.: Interminable rollout leads to a lawsuit at the source

Worth & Co. is a Pennsylvania-based manufacturing company that just wanted a new ERP system and after hearing several pitches in 2014 decided to hire EDREi Solutions to implement Oracle’s E-Business Suite. The first go-live date was November 2015. But things began to slip. The deadline was pushed back to February 2016. At that point Oracle demanded that Worth & Co. pony up $260000 for training courses and support contracts. But 2016 came and went and still no rollout. In 2017 Worth & Co. jettisoned EDREi for another integrator Monument Data Solutions. Another year was spent attempting without success to customize Oracle’s suite for Worth & Co.’s purposes.

Finally after the project was abandoned Worth & Co. did something novel in February 2019: they sued not their IT vendor but Oracle specifically citing the $4.5 million they paid the software giant for licenses professional services and training. The lawsuit is still ongoing.

11. Target Canada: Garbage in garbage out

Many companies rolling out ERP systems hit snags when it comes to importing data from legacy systems into their shiny new infrastructure. When Target was launching in Canada in 2013 though they assumed they would avoid this problem: there would be no data to convert just new information to input into their SAP system.

But upon launch the company’s supply chain collapsed and investigators quickly tracked the fault down to this supposedly fresh data which was riddled with errors — items were tagged with incorrect dimensions prices manufacturers you name it. Turns out thousands of entries were put into the system by hand by entry-level employees with no experience to help them recognize when they had been given incorrect information from manufacturers working on crushingly tight deadlines. An investigation found that only about 30% of the data in the system was actually correct.

12. PG&E: When ‘sample’ data isn’t

Some rollouts aim to tackle this sort of problem by testing new systems with production data generally imported from existing databases. This can ensure that data errors are corrected before rollout — but production data is valuable stuff containing a lot of confidential and proprietary information and it needs to be guarded with the same care as it would in actual production.

In May 2016 Chris Vickery risk analyst at UpGuard discovered a publicly exposed database that appeared to be Pacific Gas and Electric’s asset management system containing details for over 47000 PG&E computers virtual machines servers and other devices — completely open to viewing without username or password required. While PG&E initially denied this was production data Vickery says that it was and was exposed as a result of an ERP rollout: a third-party vendor was given live PG&E data in order to fill a “demo” database and test how it would react in real production practice. They then failed to supply any of the protection a real production database would need.

Surviving an ERP rollout

So what have we learned? Well don’t fall afoul of regulators make sure your data is secure and clean and document your processes before you move to a new platform — all good advice for any rollout or any other big IT project really.

Credit: 901263 / Pixabay.

A study by non-profit ocean conservation organisation Oceana has revealed that beverage company Coca-Cola increased its plastic packaging by 8.8% in one year.

The finding follows after Oceana analysed data from the Global Commitment 2022 Progress Report released by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation earlier this week.

The plastic packaging usage by Coca-Cola increased by more than 263 thousand metric tonnes from a reported 2.96 million metric tonnes in 2020 to 3.22 million metric tonnes in 2021.

Oceana strategic initiatives director Dana Miller said: “This new report makes it clear that Coca-Cola’s recycling pledges are not stopping the ever-growing tsunami of plastic that is overwhelming our oceans.

“How can the company use an additional 500 million pounds of plastic in one year and at the same time consider itself to be addressing its plastic problem?

“Bottles with recycled content will still be thrown away sent to landfills burned or littered. Some of these bottles will end up in our oceans.”

In response to the findings Oceana has called on Coca-Cola to increase refillable bottles to address its plastic problem.

According to the organisation a single refillable bottle can be used up to 25 times thereby preventing 24 single-use plastic bottles and 49 single-use bottle glass bottles.

Dana Miller added: “Just a 10% increase in refillable bottles in all coastal countries could reduce marine plastic bottle pollution by 22%.

“If Coca-Cola is serious about reducing plastic pollution it needs to stop promoting single-use throwaway plastic bottles and instead deliver on its commitment to sell 25% of its drinks in refillable and reusable bottles and containers.”

The new finding comes after a new study commissioned by Oceana exposed the weakness of plastic recycled content pledges made by beverage companies including Coca-Cola PepsiCo Nestlé Danone and Keurig Dr Pepper.

Most of these companies pledged to increase post-consumer recycled content in their polyethylene terephthalate plastic bottles from 25 to 50% by 2025.

In February Coca-Cola pledged to make 25% of all its beverage packaging across its brand portfolio reusable by 2030.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld2Zvb2RtYWdhemluZS5jb20vbmV3cy8xNjk2NDcvdG94aWMtY2hlbWljYWxzLWZvdW5kLWluLXVzLXBldC1mb29kLXBhY2thZ2luZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Toxic chemicals found in US pet food packaging,"Toxic chemicals found in US pet food packaging

Test results find “forever chemicals” in pet food packaging meaning pets across the US are being exposed to toxic substances.

Tests carried out by The Environmental Working Group (EWG) have revealed that “forever chemicals” (also known as PFAS) are present in pet food packaging.

The tests also showed that the toxic chemical was present in textile products made specifically for babies and toddlers.

Although it is “almost impossible to avoid PFAS” according to Sydney Evans a Science Analyst at EWG she explained certain packaging causes “the PFAS coating on products [to] wear off and get into dust that can be ingested by children and pets.”

What are PFAS?

PFAS (or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are a group of over 4700 industrial chemicals that are found in everyday products. They are also referred to as “forever chemicals” due to their extreme persistence in the environment with some taking over 1000 years to degrade.

A concerning factor regarding PFAS is that scientists know very little about the health concerns and environmental problems that relate to the vast majority of these chemicals.

According to PFAS Free the chemicals can cause harm to humans and wildlife and once created are difficult to destroy. What’s more studies have shown that the “forever chemicals” can cause harm to the liver and immune system of an animal.

PFAS in pet food packaging

The test results have revealed that even though pets do not consume packaging directly the wrapping itself is a significant source of the overall amount of PFAS entering the environment.

To carry out the test EWG commissioned an independent laboratory to test 11 bags of pet food for total fluorine which indicates the likely presence of PFAS. The results are usually stated in parts per million (ppm). Four bags with the highest concentrations of fluorine were sent for additional tests which revealed levels of specific PFAS compounds.

The tests uncovered individual PFAS in certain pet food bags. The detected chemicals included PFBA PFPeA PFHxA PFHpA x62FTCA x62diPAP and PFPrA.

Cat food

Looking specifically at cat food Meow Mix Tender Centers Salmon & Chicken Flavors Dry Cat Food had the highest total fluorine with 630 ppm. Further tests found two PFAS at 5.5 parts per billion (ppb).

Furthermore the sample of Purina Cat Chow Complete Chicken had total fluorine at 310 ppm. Additional tests revealed that it was contaminated with six different PFAS with 245 ppb.

Dog food

Dog food products were also tested with results finding that Kibbles n’ Bits Bacon and Steak Flavor registered 590 ppm of total fluorine. Follow up tests found two PFAS at 14.3 ppb.

What’s more Blue Buffalo’s Life Protection Formula Puppy Chicken and Brown Rice Recipe food had total fluorine of 140 ppm.

What does this mean for pets?

The EWG has stated that the results of the tests suggest that PFAS-based treatments are being used in pet food packaging. This means that when the packaging eventually degrades there could be higher PFAS concentrations in dust.

“The concentrations of PFAS found in pet food bags represent a significant source of PFAS in the home” said Evans.

“They’re a good indicator of how much PFAS may eventually be released into the environment after these coatings wear down.”

In a previous study the EWG found that pets develop health problems from chemical exposure more rapidly than humans thus suggesting that exposure to the “forever chemicals” could have significant health implications on animals.

As of yet no top pet food manufacturer has committed publicly to stop using “forever chemicals” in its packaging.",,,,,,,,,

Security At The Edge Where computers laptops and all other mobile devices go so goes security.

And in recent years that’s included the edge. Driven by the spread of remote working caused by the COVID-19 pandemic Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) was all the rage two years ago as the hot new security technology that combines wide area networking (WAN) with network security functions such as secure web gateway (SWG) and firewall as a service (FWaaS). Security on the edge is always evolving in response to ever-changing and sophisticated cyberattacks by bad threat actors. As a result investors are pumping ever more funds into startups dealing with edge security. Larger companies are investing in edge-related R&D projects -- or acquiring edge-related security tools via takeovers of smaller firms. As part of CRN’s Edge Computing 100 here are 25 security players working at the cutting-edge of the edge. They’re both big and small. They deal with technologies ranging from Wi-Fi to SASE to ‘borderless WAN’ to vulnerabilities in operational technology (OT). The common denominator for all the products: they’re trying to protect the outer perimeter of our digital world.

It's also a great way to earn a high-paying salary.

An IT certification is a standardized way to prove a person has a certain level of knowledge and ability within a specific domain of IT expertise.

A certification shows an individual has completed a course within that area of study. Certification also usually involves some form of examination. It can be in-person or virtual where a series of questions are asked to test an individual's knowledge of the subject. Upon successful completion of the exam the recipient is usually granted an IT certificate.

There are IT certifications for general IT knowledge categories and more specific areas. Some of the more specific certifications include cloud architect cloud services systems control networking cybersecurity development infrastructure and project management.

Earning an IT certification is different than earning a postsecondary degree. IT certifications are often focused on specific IT skills. Degrees tend to provide higher-level skills across computer sciences and engineering domains.

Learn more here about the differences between certifications and degrees and which is best for you.

What are the benefits of an IT certification? There are multiple benefits of an IT certification for both individuals and employers. On-the-job experience is a good indicator of an individual's capabilities but an IT certification provides a third-party validation of knowledge. This can help employers make employment decisions. A certification can also potentially lead to a higher average salary. For individuals an IT certification can make them stand out against peers who don't have one. Certification is also a form of validation showing that a professional has achieved a specific milestone. IT certification is also a vital component for career development. Nothing remains the same for long in IT. And with training and certification individuals can ensure that they are advancing in their careers. An IT certification is also often a prerequisite for certain job roles. Among the most in-demand IT tech jobs having some form of IT certification is a key requirement.

How to obtain an IT certification Getting an IT certification can vary based on the certificate. But in general there are several primary activities: Training. The first step in many IT certifications is to get some form of training. The training often includes the need to read and learn from a certain number of source materials. Training can also sometimes include hands-on labs or a virtual simulation of labs where skills are demonstrated and practiced. Many certifying bodies for specific certificates also offer training materials and courses for certificates. For example AWS offers training for its cloud certifications.

This is the final and most critical step of the IT certification process. The exam validates skills knowledge and understanding in the professional's area of study. Most certifications are granted to those who pass an examination of skills from a recognized testing center. The testing center could be a third-party resource or it could be from the certifying body itself.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaHdpcmVhc2lhLmNvbS8xMS8yMDIyL2ZyYXVkLWFuZC1tYW5pcHVsYXRpdmUtY29udGVudC1hLWNvbmNlcm4tZm9yLWdlbmVyYWwtZWxlY3Rpb25zLWluLW1hbGF5c2lhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fraud and manipulative content a concern for Malaysia's general election,"It’s the election season in Malaysia. And just like any other election in a democratic country around the world the campaign period is the best time for candidates to not only showcase their capabilities and make their pledges but also a time to call out the wrongdoings of their competitors.

While there are now more laws in place to ensure a smooth election process throughout the campaign period it’s a totally different game when it comes to the online community. Keyboard warriors continue to make their presence felt on most social media sites either throwing support or mocking candidates. Some have even resulted in producing manipulative content from blogs and videos that can be used to improve or tarnish a candidate.

These include the use of social media video sites like TikTok Reels on Instagram and such to generate manipulative content. Interestingly this has also led to an increase in deepfake videos. Deepfake videos for example are some of the most common materials used to smear election candidates in most countries around the world.

“But more than any single post the danger of manipulated media lies in the way it risks further damaging the ability of many social media users to depend on concepts like truth and proof. The existence of deepfakes which are usually created by grafting a digital face onto someone else’s body is being used as an accusation and an excuse by those hoping to discredit reality and dodge accountability — a phenomenon known as the liar’s dividend” the New York Times reported on the use of TikTok to manipulate content.

From deepfakes to fraud in election

Apart from all the campaigning and election content fraudsters are also taking the opportunity to exploit citizens. The country is already witnessing an influx of fraudsters in recent times with more fraud cases being reported compared to previous years.

In fact Malaysia has already recorded over 20000 cybercrime incidents last year with losses amounting to RM560 million. Most of these cases involve online fraud be it from banking scams to smishing campaigns. Victims included customers of some of the largest banks in Malaysia as well as those who download corrupted apps on their mobile devices.

Malaysia also recently announced the formation of the National Scam Response Center to help deal with the increasing number of scams in the country. The NSRC is a joint effort among the anti-financial crime center (NFCC) police Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) financial institutions and telecommunications companies.

For Suk Hua Lim country manager for Palo Alto Networks in Malaysia with lucrative monetary gains on the line cyber adversaries are always on the prowl to deploy phishing attacks to obtain valuable personally identifiable information.

“We strongly encourage all the stakeholders involved to prioritize a cyber-safe election and take necessary steps towards securing ownership of the digital ecosystem through education public awareness policy and regulation” she commented.

Lim also highlighted that voters too have an important role to play in safeguarding themselves against such frauds. Digital hygiene and basic practices such as vigilance awareness and thinking before clicking on unsolicited links can go a long way in mitigating such attacks.

“As GE15 continues to dominate our daily conversation we tend to overlook risks and threats that continue to loom large. Political parties candidates the government and even voters need to realize that cybercriminals are looking out to profit from this opportunity and that all of us are susceptible to cyberattacks. When it comes to cybersecurity prevention is always better than cure” added Lim."

The Grammy-winning rock band's Nov. 4 tour stop marked the 30th comedy or music show at the downtown venue in 2022 the most concert events ever to play the facility in a year.

Paycom Center notched its 31st show of 2022 Sunday night with the OKC stop on the ""R&B Music Experience"" tour featuring Monica Bell Biv DeVoe Tamar Braxton and more.

The arena's previous record of 29 concerts in a year was set in 2013.

“This is a competitive business and these shows don’t have to come to OKC"" Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt said in a statement. ""Two big contributors to this success are the team booking the shows and the residents buying tickets.""

How has the OKC arena boosted its concert numbers?

Also home to the OKC Thunder professional basketball team the arena is breaking its concert record in the same year it's celebrating its 20th anniversary.

""I think it's a combination of a healthy supply of major tours who have returned to the road post-pandemic combined with a very aggressive intentional booking strategy"" Paycom Center General Manager Chris Semrau told The Oklahoman.

""In 2018 we revamped our approach to securing touring content and we saw a big jump in '19. We had an even bigger jump in 2020 prior to the disruption. ... We worked throughout the pandemic to position ourselves so once the industry was ready to return that we were on the radar of decision makers and already positioning Oklahoma City to be a must-play on those tours.""

Events included in the record-breaking number are touring live music and stand-up comedy shows. Not included are sporting events and Thunder games family shows like the Professional Bull Riders and WWE and non-touring events.

""I think people want to live in a community that attracts great sports art music and culture events. And we think it's important to do our part to deliver a real level of content to the community as well as be an economic engine for Oklahoma City with the amount of folks who are traveling to the community to attend these major events"" Semrau said.

""For Pearl Jam as an example the downtown hotels and the airport had some of their biggest days of the year based on guests from outside the community traveling as a destination to see that show. More tickets were sold outside of Oklahoma City than in Oklahoma City for a show of that magnitude and you really feel that impact around the city on a show day.""

What have been the Paycom Center's 2022 concert highlights?

Since 2013 the closest the arena has previously come to breaking its concert record was in 2019 with 26 music and comedy events.

Paycom Center started its record-breaking 2022 in January with a sold-out crowd for Elton John's farewell trek one of the biggest tours of the year.

Other highlights of the venue's 2022 concert lineup so far include country music star and first-time headliner Morgan Wallen's sold-out March performance a full house for Andrea Bocelli's Oklahoma debut in June and tour-opening summer concerts by Kendrick Lamar and My Chemical Romance.

In September Pearl Jam finally played its pandemic-delayed Paycom Center show which spent a mind-boggling 970 days on sale drawing a full 360-set crowd. Last month Oklahoma native Reba McEntire sold out the venue in her first headlining arena gig in OKC where her singing talents were discovered back in 1974.

What concerts are coming next to Paycom Center?

Paycom Center is continuing to build on its recording-breaking 2022 with plans to host a total of 37 concerts by year's end. Upcoming shows include:

Dec. 30: Country up-and-comer Parker McCollum plays the arena's last concert of 2022.

""The demand for high-quality live entertainment plus artists wanting to get back out on the road ... we're seeing and feeling that continue into next year"" Semrau said. ""We don't anticipate a major slowdown in the touring industry and believe it'll be another robust year for events in Oklahoma City in 2023.""

What 2023 concerts have been announced at Paycom Center so far?

Several 2023 concerts at Paycom Center have already been announced including:

Feb. 24 : The ""Soul II Soul Tour"" brings in KEM and Ledisi.

So it's great that we can book those events but it's equally important that the community supports those events — which they have done in 2022 and which is generating more opportunities for 2023"" Semrau said.",https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paycom Center breaks its own record for most concerts in a calendar year,"The Paycom Center broke its own record for the most concerts held in a single year.

PayPal's (PYPL 1.00%) stock dipped 2% on Nov. 4 after it posted its third-quarter report. The digital payment service provider's revenue rose 11% year over year (12% in constant currency terms) to $6.85 billion which beat analysts' expectations by $30 million. Its adjusted earnings declined 3% to $1.08 per share but still topped estimates by $0.12.

Those growth rates seem stable but a deeper dive into PayPal's numbers reveals three red flags that indicate it isn't a bargain yet -- even though it's already shed more than three-quarters of its market cap since last July.

1. Anemic growth in active accounts

Last February PayPal declared it could nearly double its active accounts from 377 million in 2020 to 750 million in 2025. But its account growth subsequently slowed to a crawl and it abandoned that target this February. The final stages of eBay's four-year transition from PayPal to Adyen which finally concluded in the third quarter of 2022 likely exacerbated that slowdown.

Metric Q3 2021 Q4 2021 Q1 2022 Q2 2022 Q3 2022 Active accounts 416 million 426 million 429 million 429 million 432 million Growth (YOY) 15% 13% 9% 6% 4%

PayPal expects to end the year with just 434 million to 436 million active accounts which would equal about 2% growth from the fourth quarter of 2021. During the conference call CEO Dan Schulman blamed that slowdown on a ""challenging macro environment slowing e-commerce trends and an unpredictable holiday shopping season."" That gloomy outlook isn't surprising but competition from Block's Square Stripe and other payment platforms could be generating additional headwinds.

2. Decelerating growth in total transactions

Investors would probably be less concerned about PayPal's sluggish growth in active accounts if its year-over-year growth in transactions and total payment volume (TPV) were offsetting that slowdown.

In the third quarter PayPal's transactions rose 15% year over year to 5.6 billion as its TPV grew 9% (14% in constant currency) to $337 billion. Unfortunately both growth rates decelerated sharply over the past year:

Metric Q3 2021 Q4 2021 Q1 2022 Q2 2022 Q3 2022 Transactions growth (YOY) 22% 21% 18% 16% 15% TPV growth (YOY) 24% 23% 15% 13% 9%

It expects that slowdown to continue with just 8.5% TPV growth (12.5% in constant currency terms) in the fourth quarter. That slowdown indicates that the growth of Venmo which now hosts 57 million monthly active accounts still can't offset the broader slowdown of its other PayPal-branded services.

PayPal's total take rate or the percentage of each transaction it retains as revenue rose year over year from 1.99% to 2.03% -- but that improvement also couldn't offset its slowing growth in active accounts and transactions.

PayPal expects its revenue to rise 8.5% (10% in constant currency) for the full year compared to its prior forecast for 10% growth and its 18% growth in 2021. That softer guidance is disappointing but PayPal's growth could potentially stabilize in 2023 as the macro situation improves the dollar weakens again and it fully laps its decoupling from eBay.

3. Declining operating margins

PayPal's operating margin rose 330 basis points sequentially to 22.4% on a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis in the third quarter which surpassed its own guidance by about 2 percentage points. It mainly attributed that sequential expansion to more disciplined spending as its top-line growth decelerated.

But that still represents a 140 basis point decline from its operating margin of 23.8% a year earlier. It's also still well below its non-GAAP operating margin of 25.1% in 2020 and 24.8% in 2021. That pressure could persist as it ramps up its investments again or expands its lower-margin services (including its buy now pay later features) to attract more users.

PayPal now expects its adjusted EPS to drop 11% to 11.5% for the full year which is better than its prior forecast for a 14% to 16% decline but still a disappointing reversal from its 19% growth in 2021. On the bright side Schulman expects PayPal to deliver ""no less"" than 15% adjusted EPS growth in 2023 as it focuses on ""driving continued operational efficiency.""

Is PayPal's stock a turnaround play?

PayPal's stock might look cheap at 15 times forward earnings but investors should recall that it vastly overestimated its own long-term growth potential last year while underestimating the near-term impact of eBay's departure as well as the macroeconomic and competitive headwinds. It also repeatedly reduced its guidance over the past few quarters so it's tough to take management's optimistic expectations for 2023 too seriously.

PayPal isn't doomed yet but I wouldn't touch its stock until its growth in active accounts and transactions stabilizes. For now investors should stick with more promising tech stocks instead of betting on PayPal's long-term recovery.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjbWFnLmNvbS9uZXdzL3BheXBhbC1zZXQtdG8tc3VwcG9ydC1hcHBsZXMtdGFwLXRvLXBheS1mZWF0dXJlLW9uLWlwaG9uZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PayPal Set to Support Apple's Tap to Pay Feature on iPhones,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.pcmag.com/news/paypal-set-to-support-apples-tap-to-pay-feature-on-iphones on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjbWFnLmNvbS9uZXdzL3BheXBhbC1zZXQtdG8tc3VwcG9ydC1hcHBsZXMtdGFwLXRvLXBheS1mZWF0dXJlLW9uLWlwaG9uZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy50cmVuZG1pY3JvLmNvbS8yMDIyLzExLzA2L3RydXN0LXdhbGxldC1wYXlwYWwtaW52b2ljZS1zY2FtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trust Wallet PayPal Scam,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.trendmicro.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2022/11/06/trust-wallet-paypal-invoice-scam/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF12A5780>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11004] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy50cmVuZG1pY3JvLmNvbS8yMDIyLzExLzA2L3RydXN0LXdhbGxldC1wYXlwYWwtaW52b2ljZS1zY2FtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcGF5cGVycy5jb20vcGF5bWVudHMtZ2VuZXJhbC9wYXlwYWwtdmVubW8tdG8tc3VwcG9ydC1hcHBsZXMtdGFwLXRvLXBheS0tMTI1OTAzMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PayPal Venmo to support Apple's Tap to Pay,

In an 18-year-old dispute Pepsi sued Hyderabad-based MagFast Beverages for selling bottled water under the label 'Mountain Dew.'On behalf of Pepsi senior counsel K Vivek Reddy argued before a bench of Justice P Naveen Rao and Justice G Radha Rani that Pepsi had registered the Mountain Dew trademark way back in 1985 & had exclusive rights over it.MagFast had dishonestly copied the trademark for selling bottled water even though it was aware that Pepsi had exclusive rights he said.The bench issued a permanent injunction barring MagFast from infringing on Pepsi's trademark and also directed it to pay damages to Pepsi. A civil court in Hyderabad had earlier held that PepsiCo's rights over Mountain Dew were not exclusive and that MagFast also had a right to use the trademark. The trial court reasoned that while Pepsi was using the Mountain Dew trademark for soft drinks MagFast was using it for bottled water and these were two different categories. The aggrieved Pepsi challenged the trial court order before the high court.MagFast argued that it was not aware of Pepsi's trademark and claimed that it came up with Mountain Dew brand on its own in 2000 for sale of bottled water which was much before Pepsi launched Mountain Dew in India. It also said the phrase Mountain Dew was widely used.The bench however held that Pepsi had exclusive rights over Mountain Dew as it had a valid registration since 1985. Writing the order for the bench Justice Rani noted that Mountain Dew had a worldwide reputation even before 2000 and that reputation has spilled over into India even before 2000.Dealing with MagFast's claim that it was a prior user of the Mountain Dew trademark the court held that MagFast did not present substantial evidence to show that it was a prior user of the Mountain Dew trademark.The court also held that even bottled water and soft drinks were different products and if they were sold by an identical mark customers were likely to believe that both were being sold by Pepsi.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaWNhZ29idXNpbmVzcy5jb20vNDAtdW5kZXItNDAvNDAtdW5kZXItNDAtYnJpYW4tYmFybmVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,40 Under 40 | Brian Barnes,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.chicagobusiness.com/40-under-40/40-under-40-brian-barnes on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaWNhZ29idXNpbmVzcy5jb20vNDAtdW5kZXItNDAvNDAtdW5kZXItNDAtYnJpYW4tYmFybmVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

The study showed males younger than 40 years old who received the Moderna vaccine were shown to have the highest rates of myocarditis which according to the authors may have implications for choosing specific vaccines for certain populations.

Two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have been approved for use Pfizer BioNTech (BNT162b2) and Moderna Spikevax (mRNA-1273) and as of March 20 2022 more than 52 million doses of Pfizer and 22 million doses of Moderna have been administered in Canada where this study was conducted. Clinical trials have demonstrated the vaccines are safe and monitoring of vaccinated people has shown side effects are mild and go away on their own. However some rare but serious side effects have been observed after both vaccines mainly myocarditis (inflammation of the heart).

While there have been many studies on either vaccine few studies have been conducted to directly compare the safety of the two mRNA vaccines. Researchers in this study sought to compare the risk of myocarditis pericarditis and myopericarditis between the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines.

People in the study were 18 years old or older and had received two primary doses of either Pfizer or Moderna vaccine in British Columbia Canada with the second dose between Jan. 1 2021 and Sept. 9 2021. Individuals whose first or second shot were administered outside of British Columbia or had a history of myocarditis or pericarditis within one year prior to second dose were excluded.

In all more than 2.2 million second Pfizer doses were given and more than 870000 Moderna doses. Within 21 days of the second dose there were a total of 59 myocarditis cases (21 Pfizer and 31 Moderna) and 41 pericarditis cases (21 Pfizer and 20 Moderna). Researchers also looked at rates per million doses and the rate was 35.6 cases per million for Moderna and 12.6 per million for Pfizer-;an almost threefold increase after Moderna shots vs. Pfizer. Comparatively rates of myocarditis in the general population in 2018 were 2.01 per million in people under age 40 and 2.2 per million in people over age 40.

Rates of myocarditis and pericarditis were higher with the Moderna vaccine in both males and females between ages 18 and 39 with the highest per million rates in males ages 18-29 after a second dose of Moderna.

According to the authors the findings support recommending certain populations receive certain vaccines to maximize benefits and minimize adverse events.

Few population-based analyses have been conducted to directly compare the safety of the two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines which differ in important ways that could impact safety. Our findings have implications for strategizing the rollout of mRNA vaccines which should also consider the self-limiting and mild nature of most myocarditis events benefits provided by vaccination higher effectiveness of the Moderna vaccine against infection and hospitalization [found in prior studies] and the apparent higher risk of myocarditis following COVID-19 infection than with mRNA vaccination."" Naveed Janjua MBBS DrPH lead author of the study and epidemiologist and the executive director of Data and Analytic Services at the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control

Limitations of the study include that it was observational which limits the ability to determine causality between vaccination and myocarditis or pericarditis. However temporality was ensured in the study design to limit the time studied between vaccine dose and myocarditis/pericarditis diagnosis. Also the study relied on hospital and emergency department visit data and may have missed some less severe cases.

In a related editorial comment Guy Witberg MD MPH a cardiologist at Rabin Medical Center in Petah-Tikva Israel wrote the study is reassuring for vaccine safety since it provides further data that myocarditis is a very rare adverse event after both vaccines and it is an important step toward a personalized approach to administering COVID-19 vaccines.

""[The study] should help put to rest 'vaccine hesitancy' due to concerns over cardiac adverse events"" Witberg said. ""This is one of only a few direct comparisons of the two widely adopted mRNA vaccines and its results have practical policy implications: for a substantial segment of the population suffering from cardiovascular disease…these data give a strong argument to preferentially use the BNT162b2 [Pfizer] vaccine over mRNA-1273 [Moderna].""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZXBoYXJtYS5jb20vbWFya2V0aW5nL3BmaXplci10b3BzLWF1dG9pbW11bmUtcGF0aWVudHMtcmVwdXRhdGlvbi1saXN0LTIwMjEtcmVwb3J00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pfizer tops autoimmune patients' reputation list in 2021: report,"Pfizer's work on a new COVID vaccine and treatment helped the New York-based company become the most reputable pharma in the eyes of autoimmune patients last year.

That’s according to the latest report (PDF) from PatientView which between November 2021 to February 2022 collected the opinions of 293 autoimmune patient groups via an online survey on how they saw the performance of the pharma industry throughout 2021.

PatientView then takes these data and spreads them out across various data points but whichever way they sliced it Pfizer came out on top.

First up PatientView takes the data and compiles a list of the top three out of the 27 pharma companies that sell autoimmune drugs. The companies are ranked for their overall corporate reputation and are specific to those autoimmune patient groups that are familiar with the companies but not necessary groups that work with them. Here Pfizer came up ahead of the pack while AbbVie was second and Novartis was third.

It was a similar story when the top three were ranked by autoimmune patient groups specifically working with the company. Pfizer again came up on top with AbbVie also once again in second but this time Japanese pharma Takeda came in third.

Pfizer markets several big-selling autoimmune drugs including most recently Cibinqo an oral eczema treatment as well as arthritis treatment Xeljanz. AbbVie one of the biggest names in the autoimmune field sells mega blockbuster Humira—which makes $20 billion a year—for a host of autoimmune and immunology conditions and the company has newer follow-ups in Rinvoq and Skyrizi.

Takeda and Novartis market several autoimmune drugs and it is therefore no surprise to see them in the top three.

It’s also good news for the pharma industry overall. The 293 autoimmune patient groups ranked the pharma industry’s overall corporate reputation as higher than that of all other healthcare sectors including biotech retail pharmacists generic drug and medical device companies.

The report found that 63% rated the pharma industry’s corporate reputation as “Excellent” or “Good” with this figure jumping from the 47% average it hit during the four years in which the autoimmune arm of the ""Corporate Reputation"" survey ran the process.

But it is Pfizer that takes the overall win something the pharma is getting used to having been soaring high across several reputation lists over the pandemic years of 2020 to 2022—including the likes of The Harris Poll and several PatientView rankings as well—and most recently coming up on top with cancer patients.

This the report says is directly linked to its work that saw it create a new COVID vaccine with BioNTech and treatment in Paxlovid.

The report’s authors said the perceived increase in the pharma industry’s corporate reputation by autoimmune patient groups “is inevitably due in part at least to the industry’s efforts during the Covid-19 pandemic.”

They found that 79% of 2021’s respondent autoimmune patient groups rated the pharma industry’s response to the pandemic as “Very effective” or “Effective” (noticeably up on 2020’s figure of 61%).

PatientView said autoimmune patients— typically a chronic population that knows their condition and drugs very well given that it is a lifelong battle with the disease—are well placed to understand and rank pharma companies. “Patient groups—and autoimmune patient groups especially—possess a deep and unique understanding of the patients they represent and express the collated views of these patients” the report’s authors wrote.

The report added that autoimmune condition patient groups also “played a key role” in keeping the patients they represent informed and supported during the pandemic “and they clearly valued the help industry provided them at the time.”

That may go some way to explain why AbbVie which in terms of sales and drug offerings is the world’s premier autoimmune drug maker came in second to Pfizer. It’s also interesting to note that Sanofi and Regeneron are not in the top three (a full ranking was not provided) despite marketing Dupixent a major new autoimmune blockbuster that could one day rival the sales Humira has been bringing in at peak.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1tbS1vbmxpbmUuY29tL2hvbWUvY2hhbm5lbC9wZml6ZXItdG9wcy1waGFybWEtcmVwdXRhdGlvbi1yYW5raW5ncy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pfizer tops pharma reputation rankings - News,"Pfizer was the highest among 27 pharma firms ranked by patient groups for people suffering from autoimmune conditions in a new report drawing on the views of 293 such groups in 54 countries including the UK.

Pfizer rose from fourth place in 2020 to take the top spot in the 2021 rankings. AbbVie which had previously been in first place dropped to second while Novartis dropped from second to third.

Companies were scored on 10 indicators ranging from supporting patients during the COVID-19 pandemic to transparency of pricing and clinical trial data. Acting with integrity engaging patients in R&D patient-centricity and patient information were also among the indicators.

On a wider level patient groups ranked the pharma industry’s corporate reputation as higher than that of all other healthcare sectors including biotech retail pharmacists generic drug and medical-device companies.

Some 63 per cent of patient groups rated pharma as ‘excellent’ or ‘good’ – a significant increase since 2018 when it stood at just 47 per cent.

The increase is partially due to the “support provided to patient groups by the pharma industry during the COVID-19 pandemic” according to the report. Some 79 per cent of patient groups rated the pharma’s industry’s response to the pandemic as ‘very effective’ or ‘effective’ compared to 61 per cent in 2020.

The standing of pharma is also a reflection of an “improvement in pharma’s patient-group relations” it said.

Work to do

“While making clear how much they value the investment and success the industry has had in developing new drugs for many autoimmune conditions they also enunciate their desire to be more involved in research and development” the report said.

And many patient groups remain negative about prices with just 12 per cent rating the pharma sector as ‘excellent’ or ‘good’ when it comes to fair pricing policies.

In addition only 33 per cent of groups believed the pharma industry to be ‘excellent’ or ‘good’ at ensuring access to medicines.

Although the report does not make any recommendations it includes suggestions from patient groups on how pharma companies can improve their reputations. One UK group states: “All of them are trying to do the same thing which feels like a ‘tick-box’ exercise to make them look good. Most pharma will only offer support beyond the medications to those on their drug. What is truly needed is public awareness about early diagnosis – and ideally supporting those people who are not on the really expensive drugs.”

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

This is a big recruiting win for the Runnin' Utes as they add a very promising young talent to the mix.

Little announced his commitment via Twitter:

As a 6-foot-4 185 pound guard Little shows the ability to do a bit of everything. He can be the primary ball handler he has a strong handle to go along with good feel for scoring opportunities for himself or others. He can score inside and out and can play off the ball as well. There are a lot of natural playmaking qualities that Little possesses and he's showcased good defensive ones as well. Despite the fact that he saw inconsistent playing time this past season he is still regarded as a four-star transfer prospect.

Utah brought Little in for an official visit this past weekend and were able to make a very good impression. Little is a native of Finland which gives the program valuable relationships in the form of Hanno Mottola Mikael Jantunen and even Lauri Markennan all of whom are connected through the Finland national team.

Little entered the portal after his first and only season with Baylor. The Bears had quite the logjam in the backcourt which led to him looking for a better opportunity elsewhere. Little still showcased his productive potential in games where he got extended playing time.

He is a former top 50 overall prospect and top 10 point guard in the 2023 recruiting class. He committed to Baylor over Indiana and Villanova while also having significant interest from other power programs in college basketball as well. Little earned a 94 four-star rating and No. 9 ranking in 247Sports' 2023 recruiting class.

Little did not play his ""senior year"" of high school at Sunrise Christian Academy but played for the Helsinki Basketball Academy (HBA) in Finland. HBA is a part of the Finland 1st Division basketball league and is essentially a high school program competing against professional players in Finland. Little averaged 21.6 points 9.0 rebounds and 5.8 assists in 20 games in this league during the 2021-22 season.

He joins Utah with three seasons of eligibility and a redshirt remaining. He is the fourth transfer addition and joins Keanu Dawes Mason Madsen and Zach Keller in Utah's transfer portal class. Utah now has five open spots remaining on the roster.

NEW YORK and RICHMOND Va. — Philip Morris International (PMI) completed its offer to buy Swedish Match becoming the owner of nearly 83% of the company’s shares.

The Marlboro cigarette maker said in October its revised $16 billion offer retained a 90% acceptance condition; however on Monday PMI announced the offer was accepted.

“We are pleased that 82.59% of Swedish Match shareholders including—we believe—the top 10 shareholders have tendered their shares at the best and final price of SEK 116 per share. This achievement of a high controlling stake should allow us to harness the strategic potential of the transaction including anticipated revenue synergies” said Jacek Olczak CEO of PMI.

PMI also extended its now unconditional offer until Nov. 25. Olczak said PMI’s objective is to take the company private after reaching ownership of more than 90%.

“We look forward to welcoming Swedish Match’s employees and leading oral nicotine portfolio into the PMI family to create a global smoke-free champion notably bringing IQOS and Zyn together in both the U.S. and international markets” Olczak said. “We will be working together to create value as we accelerate towards our shared vision of a smoke-free future.”

Swedish Match did not immediately respond to CSP’s request for comment.

PMI offered to buy the Richmond Va.-based company—which sells products like Zyn nicotine pouches General snus Longhorn moist snuff Game and White Owl cigars and more—in May for $16 billion in a move that PMI said would help the tobacco company transition to a smokeless portfolio.

Swedish Match has already pursued the vision of a world without cigarettes and delivered strong results Olczak has previously said. Stockholm-based Swedish Match which has U.S. headquarters in Richmond Va. said its smoke-free product Zyn is the No. 1 nicotine pouch brand in the United States and shipped nearly 198 million cans worldwide in 2021.

PMI announced in 2016 its mission to replace cigarettes with “science-based less harmful alternatives as soon as possible” the company said. While nearly all its revenues in 2015 came from cigarettes in 2021 nearly 30% came from smoke-free products. By 2025 New York-based PMI aims to have more than half of its net revenues coming from smoke-free products like its heat-not-burn device IQOS.

Clearly the Fed wants to feel its way just as we do because there really isn’t a crystal ball that can tell us the exact effect on inflation.

Historically the Fed has always overdone it so there’s no reason to think that this will be different. Which means that we could be headed into a recession sometime in the middle of 2023.

Additionally the jobs data from last week which would be kind of good in normal times is kind of not-so-good now because it can only encourage the Fed to continue doing what it has been doing:

Total additions were a good bit stronger than expected although hourly earnings (up 4.7% from last year up 0.4% from the previous month) were about as expected (Bloomberg estimates quoted by Yahoo Finance).

Therefore despite all the doom and gloom in the forecast companies still don’t want to let their employees go. Not only that they’re building their forces. All except the tech companies that is because that group has built itself an army that was great during the pandemic but expensive to feed as we move down.

What this means is that we still have a resilient consumer i.e. people are still buying which means that companies are still producing which means earnings are still not as bad as they’re required to be (for the Fed). Which means that the rate hike saga is set to continue.

But there are “encouraging” signs as well.

The manufacturing PMI for October although still above 1 registered its slowest growth this year dropping to the levels seen in Jul 2020. Moreover new orders suffered a big blow as rising inflation continued to increase uncertainties.

The housing market is also softening. Tied directly to interest rates mortgage rates have jumped to 20-year highs. As a result of the hit to affordability home prices are coming down. The Fannie Mae home price index shows a 9.0% increase in prices at 2022 year-end (it was previously at +16.0%). Home prices are expected to decline 1.5% in 2023 (previous forecast was for a 4.4% increase). Total home sales are expected to drop 18.1% from last year (previous forecast was for a 17.1% decline) driven by existing home sales.

The automotive market is also entering a soft phase. With supply chain problems easing inventories have picked up. But higher rates have pushed up borrowing cost which is keeping customers away. Therefore prices should start coming down about now with a corresponding positive effect on inflation.

The macro situation described above seems to indicate that further softness is in the cards. However it’s worth noting that estimates have been coming down with the S&P 500 benchmark dropping more than 10% for 2023 on an ex-Energy basis since mid-April. There could be downside risk to the 3.5% growth in aggregate 2023 estimates for the S&P 500 but as we stand today we are only expecting a moderate recession in the back half. Therefore there is a reasonable chance of companies reporting positive surprises next year which would support prices.

And if such an outlook seems fraught with risk large cap stocks that have a relatively stronger outlook based on estimate revisions trends that also pay a nice dividend could be a hedge:

Coca-Cola FEMSA S.A.B. de C.V. KOF

Based in Mexico City the company is a franchise bottler producing marketing selling and distributing Coca-Cola trademark beverages through retail outlets restaurants and bars auditoriums supermarkets and other locations.

The Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) ranked stock pays an attractive dividend that yields 4.25%. It belongs to the Beverages - Soft drinks industry (top 34% of Zacks-ranked industries).

The 2022 earnings estimate is up 11.4% in the last 30 days. The 2023 estimate is up 7.4%. Therefore analysts are relatively optimistic about its prospects.

The shares trade at 15.15X earnings compared with the S&P’s 16.62X. They are trading below their 5-year median level of 16.73X P/E.

Japan Tobacco Inc. JAPAY

Tokyo-based Japan Tobacco manufactures and sells tobacco products prescription drugs and processed foods in Japan and internationally.

The London That Never Happened: Book Shows What Might Have Been

A new book looks at how London might have looked if various plans and schemes had come to fruition.

Just imagine...

A giant pyramid in Trafalgar Square.

An immense cartwheel aerodrome above the streets of King's Cross.

A monorail through the heart of the West End decades before the Simpsons ruined the idea with that song.

All of these schemes were once proposed for London but never saw light of day. In his new book The London That Never Happened Antony Badsey-Ellis draws together the various plans that might have seen the city transformed.

The Charing Cross heliport suggested in 1951. Image from Capital History library.

It's a book that covers several centuries. We read about an early 19th century effort to mark Newton's old house by topping it with a giant globe reminiscent of an apple. A few decades later it was suggested that the Crystal Palace should be dismantled and reconfigured into a gleaming glass tower (a precursor of The Shard though probably not possible with Victorian technology).

We're brought right up to date with a look at the doomed Garden Bridge and the partly-built Pinnacle Tower.

And it's not just buildings. The book also reviews abandoned schemes for road networks and train lines. It even includes a plan to divert the Thames via Peckham — a truly mad scheme which Londonist uncovered from the archives a few years ago.

Many of the images in the book will be familiar to those with an architectural interest — they often do the rounds on social media. But Badsey-Ellis has also woven in an impressive number of illustrations we hadn't previously seen before.

By his own admission the author hasn't attempted to be comprehensive (which would be impossible) but has chosen a selection of failed schemes most likely to boggle. We're pleased to see he included for example the notorious ""Green Bird"" a dildo-shaped skyscraper once touted for the Battersea Power Station site.

The result is a punchy eclectic volume that will offer many surprises even to those with a good grasp of London's non-existent buildings.

PXD,Pioneer Natural Resources,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vb2lscHJpY2UuY29tL0VuZXJneS9FbmVyZ3ktR2VuZXJhbC9Jcy1VUy1TaGFsZS1Qcm9kdWN0aW9uLVBlYWtpbmcuaHRtbNIBUmh0dHBzOi8vb2lscHJpY2UuY29tL0VuZXJneS9FbmVyZ3ktR2VuZXJhbC9Jcy1VUy1TaGFsZS1Qcm9kdWN0aW9uLVBlYWtpbmcuYW1wLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is U.S. Shale Production Peaking,"I have argued in a succession of OilPrice articles here here and here that the era of rapid growth in shale output was coming to an end. Until recently it was a little difficult to see as production has ramped +/- a million barrels a day from 2020 lows. Still there has been a disconnect between a couple of reports put out by the Energy Information Agency-EIA that are used to track U.S. domestic output. I refer to the EIA-Drilling Productivity Report-DPR issued monthly usually at the beginning of week-3 and the EIA-914 a monthly report published on the last day of the month. The DPR projects the present month and the next month to come making it a forecast of production based on industry reports and governmental and state agency filings. The 914 is considered to offer more accurate data as it shows production two months in arrears. Each report has its utility and is the best compilation of data that can be had from public sources.

The graph above charts data released on the Permian basin in these two reports and clearly shows a deflection between them of up to several hundred thousand BOPD. The gap is likely primarily influenced by the DPR which also tracks Drilled but Uncompleted Wells-DUCs that are withdrawn from the operator’s inventory to help maintain production and optimize field production. Beginning in the middle of 2021 and continuing to January of 2022 there was a massive drawdown in DUC inventory that has helped to skew production higher.

The graph above shows the productivity decline in the daily output of new shale wells divided by the number of rigs operating over the last year and a half. Some of this is noise from the increase in the rig count over this time period but the downward slope is undeniable. Notice how the slope for new wells has continued down even as the rig count has largely flat-lined from mid-22. Next note how the rate of DUC withdrawal began to decline in January from over 200 to just 14 in the most recent report.

As the Initial Production over the first month-IP-30 of shale wells is relatively high followed by a rapid decline over the first year the oldest of these DUC’s are in their final third of productive life and will soon enter terminal decline. If nothing changes there is a box-canyon “cliff” in shale production coming from key producing basins and especially the Permian.

The Permian is our most prolific oil play due to its wide geographical area and the multiple horizons primarily the First Second and Third Bone Spring and the Wolfcamp A B C and D that can be tapped in a multilateral well. The graph below taken from the EIA-Wolfcamp report shows the vertical alignment of these individual reservoirs in their respective sub-basins the Delaware Basin the Central Basin Platform and the Midland Basin.

The Permian today is producing about half the liquids and 25% NGL’s and 25% of the natural gas that comes out of the lower 48. To say it is indispensable to U.S. energy security is an understatement. Much of our entire marginal oil supply (the amount that could be raised or lowered depending on drilling activity) comes from this play and increasingly it is beginning to look as though its best days are in the rear view mirror in terms of top tier productivity.

What we haven’t seen up to this point are any signs of shale output reaching “terminal velocity” in oil company filings. In quarterly calls the talk has all been about controlling capex to maintain output at just above the rate of natural decline or in some cases single-digit growth. And then Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) announced its third quarter production and earning numbers last week. It was the equivalent of a ripple felt in the “Force.”

It was largely a good report that delivered most of what the analysts wanted to hear particularly on PXD’s best-in-class dividend payout of $5.71 per share in base and variable components for Q-4 2022. When management got to slide 11 of the analyst presentation they attempted to put “lipstick on a pig” as noted in the slide below describing the “deferral of delayed targets.”

Rich Dealy President of PXD commented in regard to an analyst- Doug Leggate of Bank of America question about this deferral.

“Yeah I'd say the delayed targets have underperformed where we would have anticipated. They still have great returns. It is just we have better locations in our portfolio. And so as we've gotten those results over the course of this year we've decided that that's not satisfactory to us and we want to move forward the higher thresholds. And so we've just reshuffled the deck as I said earlier and are moving to full stack basically across the field.”

During the extreme low price era of 2020-21 operators such as PXD drilled some of their top tier acreage to maintain output and get optimal payouts for their wells. As prices began to rise companies shifted their focus to lower tier wells as the high prices enabled meeting corporate IRR and DROI (Internal Rate of Return and Discounted Return on Investment) metrics while saving higher tier acreage for the next downturn.

This shift by PXD was acknowledgment that this strategy was falling short in production and a pivot to the higher tier wells and extending the lateral length to 15000 feet was necessary to maintain output. This led to further questions on this metric from the analyst cadre.

Charles Meade of Johnson Rice asked “If the changes were to reverse changes made in 2022 from 2021” or if there was “another dimension to the evolution?” In other words do you have a clue what you are doing?

To which Dealy replied “Yes Charles I'd say it's more about just the allocation of capital and moving to a higher return locations and areas. And so the returns that we are generating from the program in 2022 are still fantastic. I mean so I don't want anybody to take away that they're not great returns. It's just productivity came in a little less than we anticipated and we wanted to rectify that and fix that and we weren't satisfied with it. And so we've got a depth of portfolio that we can move things around. And so we've made those changes.” A bit of a word salad that seemed to satisfy Meade.

Summary thoughts and your takeaway

We now have both analytical and documented evidence of the maturing and slow decline of shale output from diminished reservoir quality. That has implications for the industry and for the commodity. Certainly PXD is not the only company experiencing limits to growth. Drillers will become hard pressed to maintain output through technology well spacing or even sheer numbers.

ADVERTISEMENT

This doesn’t necessarily portend a decline in revenues or profits for these companies. Conversely it could actually drive them higher as realizations improve from increased global competition for scarce supplies.

It is also worth pointing out that even with the adjustment that PXD is making to increase output over the short term they have years of top tier drilling inventory banked.

It is also worth pointing out that as these top tier locations are consumed through Full Stack and extended reach drilling to 15000’ that the estimate in the slide above may prove to be optimistic. Time will tell on that score.

One final outcome of this decline in acreage quality may be a continuation of the aggregation of small or private producers by larger public companies. An example of this would be Devon Energy snapping up bolt-on acreage in the Williston and Eagle Ford plays this year. My prediction is for more of the same in 2023 as companies look to ensure their long term viability.

The lead market ranking is a position that Lauren Davis Huntington Bank’s regional president since July intends to hang onto in the years ahead in a fiercely competitive banking market.

“I think you’ll continue to see us hold that spot. That’s going to be our focus. It is a little bit for me bragging rights but it really is hard work and a focus on the client” Davis said in an interview with MiBiz. “Our team’s really focused on deepening relationships with customers. We have a lot of the noise behind us and we’re focused on moving forward. This is an important market for us.”

The change in the Grand Rapids-area market rankings for deposit market share follows Huntington Bancshares Inc.’s June 2021 acquisition of the former TCF Financial Corp. That deal made Huntington an even bigger player in the local market and continues to alter the banking landscape in West Michigan.

The latest Summary of Deposits that the FDIC publishes each fall lists Columbus Ohio-based Huntington Bank as the new market leader for the Grand Rapids-Kentwood metropolitan statistical area that consists of Kent County and neighboring Ottawa Barry and Montcalm counties.

As of June 30 Huntington Bank held $6.26 billion in deposits across the Grand Rapids-Kentwood MSA for a 19.9-percent market share narrowly edging Fifth Third’s $6.19 billion or 19.73 percent market share.

In Kent County alone as of June 30 Fifth Third retained the top spot that it has held since buying the former Old Kent Bank more than two decades ago. However Huntington closed the gap from a year earlier as it gained deposits and Fifth Third declined.

“Fifth Third Bank remains in the top spot in Kent County and the shift we saw in the Grand Rapids MSA report was not a surprise given the merger-related activity” Fifth Third Bank Regional President Tom Welch said in a statement to MiBiz.

In June 2021 Fifth Third led Kent County with $5.22 billion in deposits or a 22.81-percent market share to Huntington’s $4.12 billion or a 17.99 percent. By June 30 2022 Fifth Third’s marketing-leading position in Kent County shrank to 20.4 percent as its deposits declined to $4.85 billion. Huntington meanwhile grew its deposits to $4.44 billion for a 18.71-percent share of the market.

The year-over-year changes occurred as total bank deposits within the Grand Rapids-area MSA grew 3.9 percent to $31.4 billion as of June 30 from $30.2 billion a year earlier.

While the change in the deposit market share rankings for the Grand Rapids MSA gives Huntington bragging rights for at least a year Davis notes that the bank’s move into the top position was by “such a minute hair” of just 0.23 percentage points above Fifth Third.

If Huntington is to remain the market leader “I have to keep working on it every day” Davis said.

Huntington’s rise to the top of the Grand Rapids-area MSA for deposit market share coincides with the bank’s broader momentum across its 11-state footprint since the TCF acquisition. The corporation recently reported solid deposit loan and earnings growth in the third quarter.

That momentum extends into West Michigan where Huntington “continues to have strong pipelines” and “we are identifying new opportunities” and business banking growth is up year over year Davis said.

Across West Michigan the Grand Rapids area offered the most notable change in the annual deposit data from the FDIC. Other markets generally saw only incremental shifts in deposit market share. One exception was Kalamazoo-based First National Bank of Michigan which recorded one of the largest year-to-year gains in moving from an 11.97-percent share of the Kalamazoo-Portage MSA market in 2021 to 13.78 percent in 2022 with $652.8 million in local deposits.

PNC Bank remained the market leader in the Kalamazoo-Portage MSA followed by Fifth Third which also continues to lead in the Muskegon and Niles-Benton Harbor MSAs. Huntington still leads the Battle Creek-area market.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndtYXIybmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2hhcmZvcmQtY291bnR5LWRlcHV0aWVzLWRpc2NvdmVyLXRocmVlLXNraW1taW5nLWRldmljZXMtd2FybnMtcHVibGljLW9mLXNpZ25z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Harford County deputies discover three skimming devices warns public of signs,"UPDATE: The Harford County Sheriff's office has released the locations of the three skimming devices that were found.

Most businesses will be open too although a few may alter their hours a bit. For instance outdoor goods retailer REI Co-op will delay the opening of its stores by two hours to give employees time to vote. Outdoor clothing maker Patagonia will close its stores offices and distribution center for the day and is giving employees paid time off.

PLAINFIELD IL — A Lockport man ""connected to all the other bank robberies in the last week"" was arrested Saturday in the parking lot of a fourth Route 59 bank by Plainfield police officials told Patch.

Officer Justin Barma was on patrol around 1:11 p.m. Saturday when he saw an individual at PNC Bank located at 13470 S. Route 59 who matched the physical description of the suspect wanted in three bank robberies that happened between Oct. 29 and Nov. 4. Although it's unclear if the man identified as 30-year-old Brian M. Flesher was about to rob the fourth bank on Nov. 4 Barma took him into custody without incident officials said Monday. Police did not respond to Patch's request for comment at the time of publication.

The Lockport man was charged with robbery a felony and is being held at the Will County Adult Detention Facility where his bond was set for $250000 with 10 percent to apply. The first in a string of three bank robberies happened at about 11:20 a.m. Oct. 29 at Heartland Bank 14901 S. Route 59. The second came two days later just before 5 p.m. on Halloween at PNC Bank 2402 S. Route 59.



Most recently BMO Harris at 15101 S. Route 59 was hit around 4:15 p.m. Nov. 4. The three banks are located within 3.5 miles of each other. At each of the three banks the suspect walked in and handed a note to the teller demanding money. In neither instance did the man display or imply he carried a weapon Patch reported.

The FBI confirmed with Patch the first two bank robberies were ""likely related"" but did not provide comment about the third. After the robberies where the suspect took an unspecified amount of cash investigators from neighboring towns coordinated with each other and the FBI to identify and arrest the offender Plainfield police said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS8yMDIyLzExLzA3L3Nlbi1lbGl6YWJldGgtd2FycmVuLWNhbGxzLXdlbGxzLWZhcmdvLWNlby1ldmFzaXZlLXByZXNzZXMtYmFuay1mb3ItZnJhdWQtY29tcGxhaW50cy1vbi16ZWxsZS1wYXltZW50LXBsYXRmb3JtLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sen. Elizabeth Warren calls Wells Fargo CEO 'evasive' presses bank for fraud complaints on Zelle payment platform,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren called Wells Fargo CEO Charles Scharf ""evasive"" saying the bank's answers to her questions about fraud across the Zelle payment platform were misleading ""insulting and useless.""

The Massachusetts Democrat who sits on the Senate Banking Housing and Urban Affairs Committee said the rate of Wells Fargo customers who reported fraud or scams on Zelle was more than twice as high as other big banks and 2.5 times higher in 2022 than in 2019 among Wells Fargo customers. She said the bank ""attempted to mislead me"" by providing limited data from 2018 and 2021.

""Your responses to the remainder of my questions were insulting and useless to your customers who have been the victims of fraud and scams on Zelle and are unaware of the higher risks they face on the platform as customers of your bank"" she wrote in a letter sent Monday to Scharf.

Warren pressed the bank and Early Warning Services the parent company of money transfer platform Zelle to release more data on fraud and scam complaints reported by banking customers. Requests for comment from Wells Fargo and Early Warning Services weren't immediately returned.

She said prior requests for specific data compiled for an October analysis of fraud and scam complaints by consumers went unheeded.

""I am disappointed by your evasive and misleading reply to my October 6 2022 letter asking about the extraordinarily high and rapidly increasing instances of fraud and scams affecting Wells Fargo customers on the Zelle money transfer platform"" Warren wrote. ""Your customers – who have in recent years endured dozens of examples of lawbreaking and mistreatment by your bank – deserve better.""

Warren's report said several big banks including Wells Fargo may have violated federal law by failing to refund a vast majority of customers defrauded on Zelle. She found that the seven banks that own Zelle and its parent company — Bank of America Truist Capital One JPMorgan Chase PNC Bank U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo — did not repay customers most of the time in 190000 cases in 2021 and the first half of 2022 where consumers said they were scammed on Zelle.

The amount of the fraudulent payments reached $213 million according to the report.

Wells Fargo was among several banks that refused to release key fraud information Warren said though the frequency of Zelle fraud and scam reports by the bank's customers was ""more than twice as high as it was for comparable banks for which we had data"" according to the letter.

Jim Seitz a spokesman for Wells Fargo told CNBC in October that Warren's analysis is ""misleading and inaccurate.""

""We welcome the opportunity to have a constructive discussion about wholistic Zelle data and industry trends — not just that of 3 banks"" Seitz said.

Early Warning Services also defended Wells Fargo in its response to the results of Warren's Oct. 3 report saying that ""recent statements regarding Wells Fargo's fraud and scam rates are inaccurate. Wells Fargo's rates of reported fraud and scams are extraordinarily low and comparable to the Zelle Network as a whole where rates of reported fraud and scams represent less than 0.1% of all transactions"" according to the letter.

The company also told CNBC in October that ""any external analysis done is incomplete and does not reflect the efforts and data reported by more than 1700 financial institutions on the Zelle Network.""

The senator called Early Warning Services' response ""inaccurate"" and said it is ""not consistent with the data provided to me by Wells Fargo and other banks that are part of the Zelle network"" according to the letter.

Warren also said the reply she received from Wells Fargo was ""wholly inadequate given the scope of the problems.""

""For example you stated that data we published on Zelle-related problems at Wells Fargo and other banks contained 'apples-to-oranges comparisons' because Wells Fargo's 'response to your data request included gross claims [and] … [o]ther responses may have used different dimensions'"" Warren wrote. ""But this assertion which is an attempt to minimize the impact of the problem at Wells Fargo is false.""

Warren asked the bank for up-to-date information on the extent of fraud scams reported by customers reimbursement rates and the dollar value of reimbursements to scammed customers she says for the fifth time. The updated data will cover 2017 to 2021 and this January through September."

Innovative ammunition maker TV Ammo going public via SPAC deal with $1.21B valuation

⟫ Hot off of a deal that will see its products on store shelves nationwide Garland-based TV Ammo is set to hit the public markets. In an all-local deal the maker of composite ammunition has inked a deal to merge with a subsidiary of Irving-based blank check company Breeze Holdings Acquisition Corp.—a move that will see the combined firm begin trading on the Nasdaq Capital Markets.

TV Ammo is the parent company of Garland composite ammunition maker True Velocity as well as LoneStar Future Weapons which it acquired last November in a deal that it valued at around $84 million.

As part of the go-public deal which is expected to close in the first quarter of next year the combined entity will take on the True Velocity name and will continue to be led by Co-CEOs Kevin Boscamp and Chris Tedford along with CFO Jeff Cutshall. The deal values the combined company at a post-transaction enterprise value of $1.21 billion generating $76.8 million in cash and $50 million in debt.

With the money raised from the deal True Velocity said it plans to expand into new markets and distribution channels and fund general corporate and marketing expenses to fuel that growth. It also aims to ramp up production.

The company aims to ramp up production partly due to its “landmark partnership” with national outdoor retailers Bass Pro Shops and Cabela’s. The three- to five-year agreement will see True Velocity sell its ammunition across all of the retailers’ channels with plans to introduce additional products in 2023. The partnership also sets up an ammunition subscription service for at-home delivery.

Rhode Island Energy announced Monday that it has started provided the credits totaling $50 million to each of its customers. The credits are being provided as part of an agreement last spring with the office of Attorney General Peter F. Neronha. The agreement helped clear the way for Pennsylvania-based PPL to purchase the Narragansett Electric Company which it renamed Rhode Island Energy.

Rhode Island Energy says it has also provided more than $43 million in debt forgiveness over the last six weeks to more than 24000 income-eligible customers.

Rhode Island Energy says it began processing a $63.92 credit on customers’ electric bills and a$64.44 credit on customers’ gas bills issued after November 4 2022. Customers who receive both electricity and gas from Rhode Island Energy will receive both credits.

To confirm the credit has been applied customers can review the “other charges/adjustments” portion of their bill typically located on page 2 Rhode Island Energy says. The credit is being applied to all accounts that were active on Nov. 1.

The credits come at a time when residents are facing increased energy costs this winter.

Dave Bonenberger president of Rhode Island Energy acknowledged the credits ""won’t alleviate all the challenges our customers are facing"" but he said ""we are hopeful these funds can help lessen the impact of higher supply prices.”",,,,,,

They can also establish a model risk framework to better use their models in a volatile environment.

Establish a robust ongoing monitoring framework

A standardized well-documented process that includes back-testing actual results against established performance metrics can help improve model reliability.

If organizations only test when they suspect a problem it is already too late. Scheduled monitoring can help spot deterioration earlier and provide an opportunity to calibrate.

Review overrides overlays and adjustments

Models are simplifications of reality. Overrides overlays and adjustments are often made for factors identified but not explicitly captured in the model. Adjustments to output can become more prevalent in a period of economic uncertainty.

Establishing a model risk framework to document support and track adjustments can provide transparency to management and users of the model. It also facilitates effective discussion and challenge of the model performance and adjustments applied.

If adjustments are continual or significant in volume or impact the model itself might need revisiting.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaW5rbmV3cy5jb20vd2h5LWZpbmFuY2lhbC1zZWN0b3ItcmVndWxhdG9ycy1uZWVkLXRvLWVtYnJhY2UtbmV0LXplcm8tdHJhbnNpdGlvbi1wbGFubmluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Financial Sector Regulators Need to Embrace Net Zero Transition Planning,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaW5rbmV3cy5jb20vd2h5LWZpbmFuY2lhbC1zZWN0b3ItcmVndWxhdG9ycy1uZWVkLXRvLWVtYnJhY2UtbmV0LXplcm8tdHJhbnNpdGlvbi1wbGFubmluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF222EC20>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaW5rbmV3cy5jb20vd2h5LWZpbmFuY2lhbC1zZWN0b3ItcmVndWxhdG9ycy1uZWVkLXRvLWVtYnJhY2UtbmV0LXplcm8tdHJhbnNpdGlvbi1wbGFubmluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVnbG9iZWFuZG1haWwuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy9nbG9iZS1hZHZpc29yL2Fkdmlzb3ItZnVuZHMvYXJ0aWNsZS1pbm5vdmF0aXZlLXNlZy1mdW5kcy13aXRoLWV2b2x2aW5nLWd1YXJhbnRlZXMtc2VlLWdyb3dpbmctZGVtYW5kLWFtaWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Innovative seg funds with evolving guarantees see growing demand amid volatile markets,"Open this photo in gallery: A whole new generation of seg funds have come to the market providing managed portfolio solutions built with lower cost ETFs.Spencer Platt/Getty Images

Segregated funds are having a moment. More precisely these investment products with an insurance wrapper have seen rising demand amid increasing market uncertainty and higher inflation.

At the same time the seg fund market has “evolved” with insurers offering a growing number of innovative products to meet the needs of clients says Steve Fiorelli senior vice-president wealth solutions at Canada Life in Winnipeg one of the nation’s largest providers of these specialized investment products.

“They have had a bit of a renaissance” he says.

He points to Canada Life’s recent white paper for advisors showing seg funds grew from $117-billion in assets under management 2019 to $130-billion by 2021 with gross sales in the first quarter of 2021 reaching $5.4-billion the highest three-month period of growth over the two-year span.

“In a relatively short period of time people have realized they need to protect their assets” Mr. Fiorelli says. “There’s that old adage that it’s not what you make it’s what you keep and segregated funds offer that principal protection.”

Those guarantees can include protecting 75 to 100 per cent of invested capital for 10 years or longer along with periodic resets (i.e. annually) as the funds’ underlying investments increase in value over time.

Seg funds also have traditionally provided a death benefit of 100 per cent. Yet more recently many have options such as a lower death benefit of 75 per cent to help reduce management fees which have been a sore spot for these products hampering their growth in the past says Andrew Clarke certified financial planner (CFP) at Clarke Financial Planning & Insurance Services in Winnipeg.

“Today there are far more ways to do guarantees” he says pointing to one provider Desjardins Group even offering inflation protection which is particularly of interest in today’s climate.

As well a whole new generation of seg funds have come to the market providing managed portfolio solutions built with lower-cost exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

Still despite their recent increase in demand seg funds remain a sliver of the $2.2-trillion of Canadian investment funds collectively worth about $125-billion as of June 30 the recent Canada Life report reveals. In part their growth has been limited because only advisors licensed to sell life insurance have access to these products.

‘Tool for certain situations’

Another limiting factor is seg funds are rarely a one-size-fits-all instrument for clients says Rod Tyler also a CFP and chartered life underwriter with The Tyler Group Financial Services in Regina.

“I see them more like a specialized tool for certain situations” he says.

Typically seg funds’ death guarantees made them popular for clients who want to leave assets to beneficiaries outside the estate he adds.

The protected capital – minus any withdrawals by the client for retirement income for example – avoids the probate process saving thousands of dollars in fees in some provinces where probate fees remain. Mr. Tyler further notes the benefit also gets into the hands of the beneficiary within a few days providing liquidity while the estate could remain tied up in probate for several months.

Another benefit is creditor protection for clients who could be vulnerable to lawsuits.

“For me I am selling these to entrepreneurs” says Mr. Clarke noting he advises several professionals who may run small consulting businesses.

Used mostly for sole proprietors seg funds as insurance products are protected by lawsuits against the client he adds.

No longer ‘plain vanilla’

Yet seg funds’ recent growth has been driven by industry innovation and increased demand for capital guarantees with set maturity dates Mr. Fiorelli of Canada Life says.

“It’s an amazing solution for advisors where they can focus more on financial planning while providing clients with that peace of mind protection along with the growth from a prudently diversified portfolio” he says.

A decade ago many seg funds offerings were “plain vanilla” in nature offering exposure to U.S. and Canadian equities whereas today these investments offer diversified portfolios that include alternative assets as well as more recently ETF-based products.

“You still get that all-in-one managed solution the seg fund protections and the cost-efficient structure of ETFs” he says noting Canada Life recently launched three ETF portfolios in October. “So now you’re getting the best of both worlds.”

Even with these new options wealth advisors like Diana Orlic a portfolio manager and investment advisor with Orlic Harding Cooke Wealth Management Group at Richardson Wealth Ltd. in Burlington Ont. see only limited use for seg funds.

“Where we may consider the use of seg funds is if someone wished to name a beneficiary with complete confidentiality and separate from the balance of the estate but [life] insurance can also accomplish that or gifting during a lifetime” she says.

Indeed advisors have alternatives to the desirable characteristics seg funds offer Mr. Tyler says. But he also notes this class of investments is generally poorly understood among Canadians who may or may not benefit from having seg funds in their portfolios.

“Sometimes seg funds are the right solution for certain people but not others” he says. “So often the best thing I can do is to help clients understand how they work and then they can decide whether they need them.”

Mr Strachan his son Noah and their pilot were tragically killed in an aircraft accident in August.

Before he died the founder and major investor in Packhorse put together a portfolio of three blue-ribbon Southern Queensland and Northern NSW grazing properties over the preceding three years designed to fit into his regenerative agriculture vision for use as ‘grass motels’ and carbon sequestration assets.

Packhorse Pastoral Co chairman Tim Samway said the directors would consider expressions of interest to continue the successful regenerative work the company has been undertaking on its properties.

That could be with a new partner who could inject substantial new capital but equally the company said it would welcome interest from local landowners who might wish to acquire one more properties and so benefit from the economies of scale they provided.

In May last year the cattle property investment manager Packhorse Pastoral Co launched an agri-business fund seeking to raise $300m in its initial move to combine cattle production with carbon sequestration on a large scale. The company announced a five-year strategy to acquire $1.5 billion worth of cattle properties stretching west of Coffs Harbour in NSW north to Bundaberg in Queensland.

Covering 27124ha (67025ac) the current Packhorse portfolio to be sold comprises:

Stuart’s Creek  8344ha 50km northwest of Roma in the Maranoa region. Packhorse paid $30 million for the property in July 2021

 8344ha 50km northwest of Roma in the Maranoa region. Packhorse paid $30 million for the property in July 2021 Moolan Downs aggregation 10029ha 200km south-east of Roma in the Western Downs region. The property was bought in an off-market deal completed in May this year which took investments to that point to $104 million suggesting a price for Moolan of around $55 million. The deal included four properties Moolan Downs Cressy Allambee and Old Southwood three of which were Certified Organic.

aggregation 10029ha 200km south-east of Roma in the Western Downs region. The property was bought in an off-market deal completed in May this year which took investments to that point to $104 million suggesting a price for Moolan of around $55 million. The deal included four properties Moolan Downs Cressy Allambee and Old Southwood three of which were Certified Organic. Ottley Station 8371ha 50km west of Inverell in northern New South Wales bought for around $20 million in February this year.

The three properties are being offered individually or collectively through CBRE’s David Goodfellow and James Auty with registered carbon baselines in place and strategies to maximise carbon sequestration and natural capital development over the next 25 years.

The cleared and semi-cleared land on all three properties is currently used for cattle grazing under a ‘grass motel’ agistment agreement with one of Australia’s largest cattle producers.

Collectively the three properties have been rated to carry about 13600 Adult Equivalents and are mostly used for growing-out cattle owned by the agistor which are bred elsewhere but moved to these stations to capitalise on their suitability for cattle growing and finishing.

In addition all the cleared and semi-cleared grazing land and all the naturally timbered lands are subscribed to profitable carbon sequestration projects instigated by Packhorse management and designed to provide both responsible environmental outcomes and substantial additional income.

“This is a strategic portfolio of properties with responsible and experienced management in place which is designed to maximise the use of the expansive grasslands in a reliable rainfall area while capitalising on numerous opportunities for improved carbon sequestration” CBRE’s David Goodfellow said.

“Packhorse is a recognised leader in carbon farming initiatives and the environmental initiatives at these stations are well ahead of industry norms with clearly established carbon baselines and management practices.”

Revenue from carbon

CBRE says the currently registered projects are set to produce about 28000 ACCUs per annum within five years. At current ACCU prices of $30 to $40 the continuation of these projects was expected to provide combined additional revenue of about $840000 to $1.12 million annually to the successful purchaser.

Each property carries a high level of improvements including generous staff accommodation cattle handling facilities reticulated livestock watering systems various shedding and grain storage facilities excellent access and subdivisional fencing to optimise both grazing and soil carbon management efficiencies across the pastoral areas.

CBREs James Auty said the sale process meant that corporations large private investors and local cattle producers would all have an opportunity to participate in the process to ensure that the best and fairest outcome was achieved.

He said a similar process was instigated for CBRE’s recent sale of the extensive Shenhua portfolio near Gunnedah which was ultimately sold to a mixture of corporate farmers backed by financial institutions and local farmers looking to expand existing family operations.

“Packhorse is willing to give both the corporate and family farming sectors equal opportunity to purchase these assets” Mr Auty said."

But the leadership and team at USI Insurance Services are up to the challenge.

Valhalla New York-headquartered USI has 9379 employees and an annual revenue of over $2 billion.

“USI promotes leaders and employees to take ownership in their individual and team performance” an employee said. “The communication systems and processes around performance are consistent and valuable to all employees at any level.”

Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer Kim Van Orman said it’s all about building a culture that goes above and beyond when it comes to employees in and out of the workplace.

“It’s critical that employees feel a strong sense of support and belonging when they show up for work each day” Van Orman said. “I am a firm believer that prioritizing ongoing investments in DE&I career development and reward and recognition programs will continue to drive higher levels of employee engagement and workplace satisfaction among all organizations.”

USI leadership is very supportive and has an interest in seeing new employees succeed.”

“I have worked several places in my career and USI by far is the most employee-driven company” one nominator said. “From senior management down everyone is approachable takes the time to know you and you feel that they want you to enjoy working there.”

USI recognizes and rewards employees for exceptional performance and dedication each year through its national Summit Awards program. Summit honorees receive company-wide recognition additional bonuses and the opportunity to participate in a bucket list experience custom-tailored to them.

This year the company expanded the prize to make 200 employees USI shareholders in 2022. The move establishes a path for all employees to have an ownership opportunity in the company and build long-term wealth Van Orman said.

And the care doesn’t stop when employees walk out the door. USI Cares helps associates and their families in times of need or crisis.

“Our employees have a variety of needs and face unique challenges in their personal and professional lives which is why we help them access financial medical housing social and emotional support through our employee assistance program” Van Orman said.

A well-known figure on the West Midlands commercial property scene is to retire director of a Warwickshire property company.

Des Wynne who has worked at AC Lloyd for the last 15 years was presented with a gift of sailing lessons at a special lunch at the House & Orangery in the Newbold Comyn Arms in Newbold Terrace East Leamington.

Around 30 colleagues and shareholders of the long-established business attended the get-together.

Wynne worked at Land Securities Group Severn Trent and Prologis UK before joining AC Lloyd in 2008 and his final position was Managing Director of AC Lloyd Strategic Land.

The 65-year-old who enjoys sailing will be staying with AC Lloyd as a non-executive director.

He said it had been rewarding to have been involved in both the commercial and residential side of the business.

“I started looking after the commercial portfolio commercial and strategic land assets and developed out a number of sites held at Tachbrook Park and Trident Park including the TATA HQ and MKM Building Supplies as well as acquiring new sites further afield for developments in Banbury and Princes Risborough in Buckinghamshire.

“I moved into focusing on strategic land which has worked really well. I am staying on as a non-executive director and I’m intending to do charity-related work in a non-executive capacity to make use of my skills as a chartered surveyor over the last 40 years as well as enjoy more sailing and other sports pursuits.

“It has been a great 15 years and AC Lloyd has been a great company to work for which is thanks to everyone who works here. I have really enjoyed it and it is in great hands for the future.”

Peter Beddoes chairman of AC Lloyd said Wynee has made a significant contribution to AC Lloyd.

“Des has been a central and pivotal member of the management team throughout his time at AC Lloyd and took on many of the roles previously fulfilled by our late chairman Gordon Nicholls” he said.

A two-story 34000-square-foot glass penthouse designed by Studios Architecture has been completed at what’s known as the Textile Building at 295 Fifth Ave. between east 30th and 31st streets. That's according to Tribeca Investment Group and its partners PGIM Real Estate the global investment management business of Prudential Financial and Meadow Partners.

The two-story addition is part of the more-than-$400 million redevelopment of a 700000-square-foot building that had been used mainly as showroom space for the textiles industry before the project began. More than 2 1/2 years into the pandemic the new owners are counting on the big floor plates rustic steel pinewood floor and other historic details of the updated building to make the property highly competitive.

Overhauled or new properties with larger floor plates and big blocks of space appeal to larger companies seeking to house their employees in one area as they try to attract talent and entice staff back in a challenging time for the U.S. office market.

The redevelopment comes as remote work and the uncertain future of office real estate are just some of the challenges landlords face in New York and elsewhere. Worries about a looming recession and higher interest rates have also seized up market activity and led companies to be more cautious with their leasing plans.

Tech giants including Amazon and Facebook parent Meta have announced plans to pull back on real estate or other expansions. The tech sector cutbacks have recently been noted by developers including SL Green Realty Manhattan’s largest office landlord and Vornado Realty Trust.

Against that backdrop the addition at 295 Fifth seeks to make the building more enticing to corporate tenants by bringing the formerly 17-story building to 19 stories and creating a terrace — with looming views of the Empire State Building a few blocks to the north and One World Trade Center much farther away to the south — where a formerly underused rooftop used to be. It’ll be for the use of the tenant taking up that floor.

Opened in 1920 by prominent builder George Backer 295 Fifth’s redevelopment also included updated elevators and windows; a hotel-like lobby and lounge space filled with plants; a courtyard garden on the ground floor; and a separate outdoor terrace on a different floor also intended for use by that level’s tenant.

With most of the building floors offering at least 41000 square feet to 44000 square feet each 295 Fifth is billing itself as one of just a handful with floor plates of at least 35000 square feet and blocks of space spanning at least 250000 square feet — that’s highly attractive to major tenants. Competing buildings such as One Madison Avenue the trophy tower across from Madison Square Park by SL Green and Brookfield Properties’ Two Manhattan West on the far west side have signed tenants such as IBM and Franklin Templeton as well as KPMG and D.E. Shaw respectively.

295 Fifth “competed in the conversations” with One Madison Avenue and Two Manhattan West according to Elliott Ingerman founding principal at TIG which led the 2019 purchase of the building with its partners. Some of those well-known tenants that have signed in those buildings also eyed 295 Fifth he said in an interview with CoStar News declining to specify the names.

Tishman Speyer’s Morgan North redevelopment located at 341 Ninth Ave. on the West Side is another rival property as is the combined 555 Greenwich St. New York’s first speculative office project during the pandemic and 345 Hudson St. in the Hudson Square market according to Ingerman.

In New York 295 Fifth Ave.’s outdoor terraces offer views of the Empire State Building just a few blocks to the north. (TIG PGIM Meadow Partners)

Luring Employees Back

Companies “are trying to create an environment for their people where they will get people back to work” Ingerman told CoStar News. “They feel they need to move to a cool neighborhood to get young people back. [Midtown South] is a cool funky neighborhood. ... The product we are trying to lease is a fully renovated building that takes into consideration of the challenges of bringing people back to the office.”

Still prospective tenants are taking longer to make decisions because they are debating how best to redesign and use their office space he said.

Even though redeveloping 295 Fifth was first inspired by tech companies long using their offices and amenities as a way to lure talent Ingerman said it’s not dependent on the tech sector to lease up space.

“The reaction has been extremely positive” since most of the building opened to tours in late September and early October he told CoStar News.

Overall third-quarter office leasing in Manhattan reached its highest level since the pandemic led by large companies signing at well-located properties with appealing amenities in a so-called flight to quality. In another example of companies reinventing their workplace to entice workers back SL Green recently said relocations have jumped to over 40% of its third-quarter leases up from typically only 30% of leases signed.

Vornado on Tuesday noted a continued divide in demand for older commodity buildings in need of upgrades and Class A properties.

Speaking to the allure of the Midtown South market the area for the first time in decades beat midtown Manhattan where steel-and-glass buildings have long been the hallmarks of New York’s office market as the most expensive office cluster in the first quarter according to a Colliers report. Ingerman defines Midtown South as south of 34th Street and to the north of Canal Street while Colliers defines it as south of 40th Street.

Among Class A buildings a Transwestern report recently showed Midtown South commanded the highest average per square foot of $84.56 in the third quarter above Midtown's $82.12 and Downtown’s $57.61.

Since the summer 295 Fifth has been “going back and forth with three groups for large blocks of space” Ingerman said adding one prospective tenant is seeking 300000 square feet to 350000 square feet while the other two are eyeing footprints of 120000 to 160000 square feet each. The property also has started to talk to smaller- and medium-size tenants seeking 60000 square feet and 80000 square feet he said.

Neighborhood Transformation

Ingerman’s bet on 295 Fifth comes as the NoMad area where the building sits has seen a transformation in recent years in becoming a live-work-play hub. There are about a dozen hotels within two blocks of the building as well as restaurants and bars nearby Ingerman noted.

“Why is that important?” he said. “These young people want to be able to go out and drink and have lunch. All these hotels have beautiful rooftop terraces and restaurants. It’s creating a very exciting environment.”

A case in point the Ritz-Carlton luxury hotel brand billed as “the gold standard of hospitality” in July opened its second Manhattan location in NoMad in an attempt to attract young affluent travelers.

The broader NoMad and Flatiron neighborhood last year attracted Microsoft to another building 11 stories more than a century old and a 12-minute walk south on Fifth Avenue. The Flatiron and NoMad district’s leasing volume in the third quarter jumped nearly 74% to 845000 square feet from a year earlier and nearly three times the pre-pandemic level in the third quarter of 2019 according to the Flatiron NoMad Partnership an area business improvement district.

Return-to-office rates in Flatiron and NoMad continued to increase and have surpassed citywide trends according to the BID which said a rise in foot traffic and subway ridership within the neighborhood led to 60 ground-floor retail shops opening in the third quarter alone including many fast-casual restaurants.

To respond to the demands of today’s tenants 295 Fifth turned down a bank retail tenant’s request to extend its lease as the building plans to feature food and beverage as well as fitness and wellness retail tenants Ingerman said.

At 295 Fifth prospective tenants run “a full gamut” according to Ingerman. They include financial legal fashion media and tech companies coming from different parts of Manhattan including Midtown South and Midtown.

He expects the building with asking rents of $95 to $135 per square foot to have finalized “a couple of transactions” by the fourth quarter or the first quarter next year he told CoStar.

“People are trading up” he said. “It’s not like we are competing with 20 properties. We are competing with two or three. If you want a good product you are going to pay for it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vZnJlZWJlYWNvbi5jb20vbGF0ZXN0LW5ld3MvaG93LWJ1c2luZXNzLWdpYW50cy1nZXQtbG93ZXItaW50ZXJlc3QtcmF0ZXMtZm9yLW1lZXRpbmctZGl2ZXJzaXR5LXF1b3Rhcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Business Giants Get Lower Interest Rates for Meeting Diversity Quotas,"Amid an uptick in race-conscious hiring programs throughout corporate America many prominent businesses are now writing racial and gender quotas into their credit agreements with banks tying the cost of borrowing to the companies’ workforce diversity a Washington Free Beacon analysis found.

The businesses that have struck such agreements include the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer the consulting groups Ernst & Young and AECOM insurers Prudential and Definity Financial private equity firms BlackRock and the Carlyle Group the technology company Trimble and the telecommunications giant Telefónica.

Over the past two years each of those companies has secured a lending agreement known as a credit facility that links the interest rate charged by banks to the company’s internal diversity targets creating a financial incentive to meet them. If the business achieves its targets it won’t have to pay as much interest on the loans it takes out; if it falls short it is required to pay more.

Under the terms of BlackRock’s $4.4 billion credit facility for example Wells Fargo will lower the firm’s interest rate by 0.05 percent if it hits two benchmarks—a 30 percent increase in the share of black and Hispanic employees by 2024 and a 3 percent increase in the share of female executives each year—or hike the rate by the same amount if it misses both.

The agreements which typically involve multiple banks are effectively credit cards for businesses: Rather than make a onetime loan lenders extend a continuous line of credit that companies can dip into at will either to cover operating costs or as a rainy day fund for emergencies. That means changes in a facility’s interest rate—even modest ones like BlackRock’s 0.05 percent diversity adjustment—can have an appreciable effect on a business’s bottom line.

Companies have advertised these agreements as proof of their progressive bona fides. Trimble CEO Rob Painter for example said the company’s credit facility—which conditions interest rates on the percentage of female employees—illustrates Trimble’s ""commitment"" to ""gender diversity in the workplace."" In press releases announcing their own credit facilities executives at BlackRock Prudential and Definity say the agreements demonstrate their commitment to ""accountability.""

But critics see something far more sinister: a form of blatant discrimination that will harm consumers credit markets and the rule of law.

""If a bank penalized a company's credit rating because it had too many women or was too racially diverse we would be appalled"" said one senior government regulator who managed a nine-figure credit facility as a lawyer in private practice. ""This is the exact same thing except the penalized target is white men.""

The credit contracts will divert resources away from consumers critics say and toward diversity initiatives where the promise of discounted loans will encourage the use of illegal hiring quotas. They will also hurt companies that don’t negotiate a diversity discount on their loans because those firms will face higher borrowing costs than their competitors—a dynamic that could steer entire industries toward race-conscious policies.

""Let’s say Wells Fargo will loan to BlackRock at 1 percent if it meets diversity quotas and the market interest rate is 5 percent"" said Will Hild the executive director of Consumers’ Research. ""Every other company that has to borrow at 5 percent is now at a disadvantage vis-à-vis BlackRock. So other companies will have to follow BlackRock’s lead or they will go out of business because BlackRock will be able to subsidize its products through Wells Fargo.""

BlackRock Wells Fargo and Bank of America which manages the credit facilities for Trimble Carlyle and Pfizer did not respond to requests for comment.

The contracts represent a new twist on the Environmental Social and Governance (ESG)-linked loans that have proliferated in recent years. When banks lend to businesses they typically base interest rates on several factors such as a company’s cost structure or debt ratio that drive credit risk. Since 2017 however some banks have also factored in ESG considerations—a borrower’s carbon footprint for example—in addition to the ability to pay back a loan.

With diversity quotas in the mix that gap between credit risk and credit access has only grown. ""There is no evidence that diversity makes a borrower likelier to repay its loan"" the government regulator said. ""It’s like handing out credit based on astrological sign.""

When a bank lends irrationally to one client the regulator added it ""invariably makes its loan terms less fairly priced for everyone else.""

The credit deals come as race-conscious programs are exploding across corporate America—and sometimes in the companies’ own faces. Pfizer one of the businesses that has tied its lending costs to diversity was sued in September over a prestigious fellowship that bars white and Asian applicants. Programs at Microsoft IBM and Google use similar criteria as do American Express and Amazon both of which are now facing civil rights lawsuits.

Race-conscious loans will encourage such policies legal experts said and could expose companies to legal liability. Even if businesses don’t adopt overt quotas said Adam Mortara a prominent civil rights litigator the agreements could be used as evidence that the firing of a white or Asian employee was racially motivated ""because of the incentives this kind of race-based discounting creates.""

That said it’s not clear whether the contracts are illegal in and of themselves. There is no federal civil rights law that directly bans discrimination in business loans three lawyers said unlike discrimination in consumer lending and employment and lawyers were divided on whether the agreements would hold up in court.

""You could argue the agreements themselves are permissible as long as the businesses reach their diversity targets without violating civil rights law"" said Hild who also founded the public interest law firm Cause of Action. ""Of course—if there were a way to do that—they wouldn’t need these agreements.""

Other lawyers said the contracts created such a strong incentive to discriminate that courts might strike them down. If a business cannot boost its minority employment through race-blind means said James Copland the director of legal policy at the Manhattan Institute hard quotas will be the only way for it to avoid losing money under the terms of the lending agreement.

""This is an implicit violation of the Title VII"" the law that prohibits employment discrimination Copland told the Free Beacon. ""It has to be illegal.""

Credit facilities are the product of complex confidential negotiations between a company and its lenders making it difficult to know which party proposed what provisions though all clauses must have the signoff of both banks and borrowers.

It might seem odd for businesses to risk a choice between breaking the law or hurting their pocketbooks and odder still for them to celebrate it. But if a company is ideologically committed to quotas Hild said the credit deals can make a kind of circular sense in both economic and legal terms.

Economically the company gets a discount for a policy that it was already going to implement. Legally it gets a shield against shareholders who see diversity initiatives as a drag on business performance—because under the terms of the loan agreement more diversity means lower costs.

""The company can argue that its diversity policies make borrowing less expensive and thus fulfill its legal obligation to shareholders"" said Dan Morenoff the executive director of the American Civil Rights Project who has filed shareholder lawsuits against corporate executives over their race-conscious programs.

The counterargument Morenoff added is that these policies are very vulnerable to civil rights complaints. If a court enjoins a company’s race-conscious programs it might not be able to meet the diversity targets specified in its credit agreement in which case the cost of borrowing would go up.

The calculus is similarly complex for banks. On the one hand lenders will make less money if they loan to businesses at a discounted rate. On the other hand Hild said linking the discounts to ESG objectives including diversity may boost banks’ ESG scores and thus attract capital from ESG investors—some of which like BlackRock are themselves the recipients of ESG loans.

The private equity firm also owns 7.1 percent of Wells Fargo the bank managing its credit facility and likely holds stock in other participating lenders as well Morenoff said. So when BlackRock secures an ESG loan from those banks it may indirectly be boosting the value of its own equities.

The result—if nobody sues—is a win-win for both lender and borrower. The losers are innovators pensioners and the consumers who will bear the costs of a distorted market.

""The purpose of bank lending is to allocate capital to its best use so that we can have better products at a lower price"" Hild said. ""If you subsidize diversity you are focusing the market on other things.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vcG1uZXdzbmlnZXJpYS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS8wNy9wcnVkZW50aWFsLWFmcmljYS1sZWFkcy1pbmR1c3RyeS13aXRoLWhpZ2hlc3QtbWlsbGlvbi1kb2xsYXItcm91bmQtdGFibGUv0gF0aHR0cHM6Ly9wbW5ld3NuaWdlcmlhLmNvbS8yMDIyLzExLzA3L3BydWRlbnRpYWwtYWZyaWNhLWxlYWRzLWluZHVzdHJ5LXdpdGgtaGlnaGVzdC1taWxsaW9uLWRvbGxhci1yb3VuZC10YWJsZS8_YW1wPTE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Prudential Africa leads industry with highest Million Dollar Round Table,"Prudential Africa has announced that 222 of its sales representatives across seven of its markets in Africa have qualified for the Million Dollar Round Table (MDRT) in the first half of 2022.

Here are eight key opportunities solution providers can leverage from security to IoT as a service to distributed storage and more.

If the last two-plus years of creatively supporting unexpected IT use cases in the midst of a global pandemic has taught the industry anything it’s that the network edge is where the action is. Businesses are searching for new ways to provide a more responsive end-user experience while preserving network performance. Bringing processing closer to the user through edge computing allows for quicker and more efficient operations said Mike Pittman founder and CEO of solution provider Connected Solutions Group (CSG). Richmond Va.-based CSG is betting big on all things edge. The company’s mission is to help customers adopt edge processing Pittman said because edge computing is becoming increasingly influential in smoothing out the subtle realities of daily operations for many businesses. “The real power of the edge is when it reaches normalcy in your daily life” he said. “And we’re just scratching the surface there.” According to research firm IDC worldwide spending on edge computing is expected to reach $176 billion in 2022 an increase of 14.8 percent over 2021. Enterprise and service provider spending on hardware software and services for edge solutions is forecast to sustain this pace of growth through 2025 when spending will reach nearly $274 billion according to IDC. It’s safe to say that solution providers shouldn’t sleep on these emerging edge opportunities. For starters? Security. High-profile breaches and ransomware attacks have long made the news and have been on solution providers’ radars. But thanks to the intelligent edge the attack surface just gained a potential plethora of new entry points. Meanwhile 5G will play a pivotal role in supporting brand-new edge and IoT use cases such as autonomous vehicles factory automation remote health care and patient monitoring and smart buildings and stadiums according to IDC. Solution providers say that the link between 5G and edge computing can be boiled down to latency. The fifth-generation global wireless technology promises to fuel innovation at the edge by enabling more data collection and faster processing than ever before. “That’s what everybody’s looking for as we head toward this 5G revolution. Edge is going to help bring the performance of 5G to the masses” Pittman said. Still in its infancy the edge computing market is being impacted by a number of factors including growth in IoT distributed storage AI private networking and hybrid work to name a few. Here are eight trends that will create edge opportunities for the channel in 2023.

1. Continued IoT Market Growth For enterprise adopters edge use cases with the largest investments in 2022 include manufacturing operations production asset management smart grids omni-channel operations public safety and emergency response freight monitoring and intelligent transportation systems. Use cases that will see the fastest spending growth from 2020 to 2025 include public infrastructure maintenance network maintenance anatomy diagnostics and augmented-reality-assisted surgery according to IDC. What’s more the research firm expects hardware and services spending will account for 85 percent of all edge spending in 2022 with the remainder going to software. Hardware spending will be led by investments in edge gateways which require low-power components designed for running limited or single functions in environments where power and cooling availability is limited. In other words this is the perfect gear for many IoT environments. For CSG IoT is a big part of its future Pittman said. The solution provider is launching a sensor division and an IoT endpoint management platform which Pittman said is crucial for getting actionable data into the hands of customers. And that’s just the beginning he added. “We’re developing the platform and we are absolutely bundling solutions around it every day” he said.

2. The Case For IoT as a Service First comes IoT then comes IoT as a service. The emerging trend is an important one that solution providers said will help increase IoT adoption. That’s because IoT as a service presents an attractive buying model for customers and a way for the channel to create a winning template for secure IoT use cases that can be scaled up or down easily. Altaworx a Fairhope Ala.-based solution provider that was recently named to CRN’s 2022 IoT Innovators list seized on the IoT opportunity early. Then the company’s CEO Rickie Richey challenged his employees to look at IoT through an as-a-service lens. Richey and his team have been busy in recent years developing an IoT platform. They started by creating an algorithm that allowed Altaworx to bill customers based on consumption of AT&T’s—and now T-Mobile’s—LTE services if a customer failed over to cellular connectivity. The platform has since grown way beyond its initial scope Richey said. “I said to my company ‘Look I want you guys to go back and think about how somebody could build a managed service with this platform’” he said. Today the Advanced Management Operations Platform (AMOP) is a tool that allows users—namely other solution providers as well as enterprises—to fine-tune how their end customers manage and use data. The platform offers features such as packet filtering and private WAN services and lets users build customized business rate plans that can be throttled by the partner to decrease the risk of expensive overage fees. AMOP integrates with the Cisco Jasper platform for IoT cellular connectivity management. The mature platform counts some of the country’s largest solution providers as users Richey said. One California-based solution provider that’s using AMOP handles LTE failover and Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) line replacements for service provider giant Lumen Technologies the company’s largest customer. Still another AMOP customer business LTE provider For2Fi is using the platform to enable cellular as a primary internet connection for retail environments. “We’re trying to get to where this becomes a platform that someone can use to manage all their customers and all their SIMs whether they bought them from us or they bought them directly from AT&T. So now they could either do a managed service with their SIMs or [our] SIMs and it doesn’t really matter” Richey said. “That’s what we’re really going to be pushing hard for in the next 12 months—building IoT as a managed service.”

3. 5G Gains Ground Solution providers say 2022 was the year that 5G went from an exciting prospect to a mainstream offering. Carriers have been diligently building out their footprints which are now ready for prime time in many areas of the U.S. 5G can enhance edge computing applications by reducing latency bettering application response times and improving businesses’ ability to collect and process data. The global 5G services market size was valued at $48.25 billion in 2021 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 56.7 percent from 2022 to 2030 according to Grand View Research. Small businesses and rural environments that have been relying on LTE are already starting to enjoy the benefits of 5G while some enterprises are even willing to test and trial 5G as their primary form of connectivity for certain applications. It’s a request that CSG’s Pittman said he and his team are running into more and more every day. “It’s a wireless solution that is relatively easy to manage and they can get the signal from the air instead of running cable and wire everywhere. They’re all about it—they just want to see it work” he said. Altaworx’s Richey said 5G represents a new connectivity option for customers that may have a challenging location that can’t be reached via broadband. “We’re seeing more and more customers that are comfortable with it now” he said. Richey said that while the networks are robust enough to handle 5G or LTE failover 5G-capable devices haven’t quite caught up yet. “There’s still a little bit of hype there. I think devices are still way behind the networks” he said.

4. The Rise of Edge AI Tantalus Systems a smart grid solution provider for public power and electric cooperative utilities is focused on modernizing utility infrastructure for a more sustainable decarbonized future for about 260 public power utility providers in North America. That modernization involves empowering customers to leverage data for greater “command and control” at the grid edge said Michael Julian CRO of Burnaby B.C.-based Tantalus. “Our view is that utilities are going to have a tremendous amount of difficulty in decarbonizing their generation sources and keeping up with the demand associated with electrification unless of course they’ve got assets on their grid both digitized and under their control” he said. That’s where the company’s partnership with Cisco comes into play. Cisco brings the IoT edge devices and computing hardware on which Tantalus’ software resides. Combined the solution gives end users granular visibility and control over distribution and automation assets including voltage regulators and capacitor banks. Digitizing and managing these assets are becoming more critical especially as providers look to accommodate renewable energy sources that are not always available like solar and wind he said. Once utility customers have access to data coming in from the edge AI is playing an important part in providing “actionable intelligence” based on real-time data that might be happening at the meter substation or distribution asset Julian said. AI can help detect previously undetectable anomalies like changes in voltage or issues caused by weather. “With that AI we can provide real visibility to a utility to tell them that for example ‘Hey we noticed these anomalies in this part of your service territory at a time when the winds were extremely high.’ Or ‘There’s potentially vegetation overgrowth that’s coming in contact with distribution lines and very likely during the next wildfire or during the next ice storm it’s a very likely place for a failure or an interruption that could be avoided’” Julian said. By 2027 machine learning in the form of deep learning will be included in more than 65 percent of edge use cases up from less than 10 percent in 2021 according to research firm Gartner.

5. Taking Networking Private Many businesses are turning to private networking for their IoT use cases using LTE. The rise in interest around private networking has even sparked a new market opportunity for startups like Celona an enterprise private 5G provider that was founded in 2020. Cupertino Calif.-based Celona has an OEM partnership with Aruba Networks a Hewlett Packard Enterprise company that is helping partners include cellular as another connectivity option in their toolkits. Pier Group a Jasper Ind.-based solution provider and Aruba partner that’s using Celona’s offerings is focused on serving customers in the education and research verticals. The company is connecting securing and managing new kinds of endpoints for its campus IT customers that are getting requests for IoT “thrown into their laps” every day said Jason Coclanes named account manager for Pier Group. One such use case involves connecting sensors in a cornfield so that a university research group can measure humidity water and sunlight for its crops. Pier Group is working through the proof-of-concept project with the university which will rely on private cellular to cover a very large agricultural area Coclanes said. “[Private cellular] is a very cost-effective model that can then be used to backhaul to their traditional campus infrastructure. That’s something completely private that is a use case that we’ve started to see pick up reasonably” he said. “Some of these places are 40 to 50 miles outside of central campus and there isn’t much of an alternative. These use cases are really paving the way for what will ultimately become an enterprise use case in the future.” Altaworx for its part uses private networking because many existing IoT management platforms don’t allow users to cull or throttle data or build VPNs back to the customer Richey said. “We built that into our private network and it was a little bit of a struggle getting with the carriers where we could recognize the devices and create rules. But that’s getting a lot of traction now because that’s really one of the ways you can secure some of this stuff” he said. Getting devices off the public internet is one of the few ways partners can secure IoT endpoints Richey added. “If you can’t upgrade the software and people don’t want to replace them send them to a private network” Richey said. Private networking initially can be more complicated to build than relying on public connections but it makes security easier in the long run he said. Another bonus? Private networking for IoT use cases also can help to unclutter increasingly convoluted corporate networks he added.

6. Securing The Edge Solution providers in the past focused on securing the walls of the enterprise campus. It’s an approach that doesn’t work in today’s multi-cloud world with a global workforce solution providers said. Vendors and solution providers alike are investing millions in launching and deploying new edge security offerings to combat the growing attack surface spurred by the COVID- 19 pandemic as well as the uptick in public awareness around ransomware attacks. These offerings include new innovations around Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) technology Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) SD-WAN with built-in security and threat detection response and prevention capabilities. Securing WAN edge infrastructure is a big requirement for businesses that are dealing with distributed workloads and users said Bill Tracy vice president of technology solutions “ “It’s definitely a hot topic” he said. “Customers are asking ‘How do I transform and simplify security? And what do I do with CASBs and SASE to complement that?’” Edge security involves a blend of security strategies and planning visibility is key Tracy said. “First we have to help [customers] get their heads around where their traffic and data is going and what we need to secure. It might be a combination of things like secure edge appliances maybe it’s cloud-based technologies that are sitting more adjacent to where the user is and sometimes even agent-based technologies at the user level to protect them wherever they may be working from.” Still the edge needs the same systems in place for access and control that traditional IT environments require including multifactor authentication zero trust and access management said Joel Grace senior vice president of IT infrastructure and cloud practice for Sayers a Vernon Hills Ill.-based solution provider. From a networking standpoint encryption and network segmentation are just as important at the edge Grace added. “You want to extend the policies that you implement in the core network as far as you can out to the edge” he said. With the edge acting as multiple potential entry points into the network Grace said that securing the edge as IT environments become more complex is “absolutely critical.” It’s something businesses can’t afford to overlook. “With complexity comes risk” he said. “You could put up a firewall for a perimeter at your corporate network but at the edge you’ve got wireless networks potentially physical access issues and devices moving around the environment. Edge expands the attack surface for your enterprise and unless it’s done properly and you get the security teams involved in these edge deployments it could be very risky and should make any security [professional] nervous.”

7. Distributed Storage Instead of storing data in one data center or public cloud location distributed cloud storage is data stored on clusters of storage nodes that are geographically dispersed. The approach is becoming critical for not only edge computing but local data processing and strict data security and privacy requirements. By 2025 Gartner estimates that 75 percent of data will be processed at the edge outside traditional centralized data centers and the cloud resulting in faster response time and reduced latency. “There are global brands and global companies that are [saying] ‘We are going to be out of our data center in the next 12 months and we need a simpler strategy for managing our WAN edge and our branch infrastructure’” Structured Communication Systems’ Tracy said. Businesses are concerned about latency and transaction time. “As such it doesn’t make sense to bring all those users back to a central hub to access the applications that might be located 30 miles away from them in an AWS data center” he said. Structured Communication Systems has seen a big revival of the storage market over the last 18 months Tracy said. Customers are demanding hybrid cloud storage environments that put data close to their end users with network-attached storage for archiving and backup. “We’ve seen the storage environment really changing over the last seven or eight years with storage declining but now we’re starting to see a resurgence in that conversation” he said. “I think what most people are finding is even just a generic [Microsoft] Azure or AWS storage volume is not meeting the needs of their users to access that data.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMi4AFodHRwczovL2RhbGxhc2lubm92YXRlcy5jb20vZm9sbG93LXRoZS1tb25leS1hZXJ3YXZlLWxhbmRzLTIwbS1mb3ItY29ubmVjdGl2aXR5LXBsYXRmb3JtLWFsaWduLWNhcGl0YWwtcGFydG5lcnMtcmFpc2VzLTYyMG0tZm9yLXRoaXJkLWZ1bmQtbGVubm94LWNhcGl0YWwtcGFydG5lcnMtYWZmaWxpYXRlLWxlYWRzLTExMG0tc2VyaWVzLWItZm9yLXF1YW50dW0tdGVjaC1maXJtLWFuZC1tb3JlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Follow the Money: Aerwave Lands $20M for Connectivity Platform Align Capital Partners Raises $620M for Third Fund ...,"Follow the Money: Aerwave Lands $20M for Connectivity Platform Align Capital Partners Raises $620M for Third Fund and More In this week’s North Texas deal flow you’ll also find news about automated payment solutions startup UPAY raising new funds; Fort Worth’s Star Castle Ventures' $5.25M raise; Carlyle Group acquiring a majority stake in Dallas’ Aspen Power Partners; CenterOak Partners selling Wetzel’s Pretzels for $207M; and other deals.

Innovative ammunition maker TV Ammo going public via SPAC deal with $1.21B valuation

⟫ Hot off of a deal that will see its products on store shelves nationwide Garland-based TV Ammo is set to hit the public markets. In an all-local deal the maker of composite ammunition has inked a deal to merge with a subsidiary of Irving-based blank check company Breeze Holdings Acquisition Corp.—a move that will see the combined firm begin trading on the Nasdaq Capital Markets.

TV Ammo is the parent company of Garland composite ammunition maker True Velocity as well as LoneStar Future Weapons which it acquired last November in a deal that it valued at around $84 million.

As part of the go-public deal which is expected to close in the first quarter of next year the combined entity will take on the True Velocity name and will continue to be led by Co-CEOs Kevin Boscamp and Chris Tedford along with CFO Jeff Cutshall. The deal values the combined company at a post-transaction enterprise value of $1.21 billion generating $76.8 million in cash and $50 million in debt.

With the money raised from the deal True Velocity said it plans to expand into new markets and distribution channels and fund general corporate and marketing expenses to fuel that growth. It also aims to ramp up production.

The company aims to ramp up production partly due to its “landmark partnership” with national outdoor retailers Bass Pro Shops and Cabela’s. The three- to five-year agreement will see True Velocity sell its ammunition across all of the retailers’ channels with plans to introduce additional products in 2023. The partnership also sets up an ammunition subscription service for at-home delivery.

Therapies in development for neurodegenerative diseases are looking beyond Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s with novel mechanisms of action targeting newer pathways.

BioAge Labs PTC Therapeutics Biogen and others highlighted these approaches at the Cambridge Innovation Institute's recent Discovery on Target meeting.

The Broad Potential of NLRP3 Inhibitors

BioAge Labs focuses on the aging process itself to identify why and how people age examining deep phenotypic data that includes cognition as well as lung capacity body type skin thickness and other factors.

“Data shows those with high levels of NLRP3 have poor survival levels (from all causes of mortality) as well as cognitive decline” said Rusty Montgomery Ph.D. VP biology at BioAge in his presentation. Preclinical data suggest that knocking out NLRP3 extends the lifespan of mice and also helps their muscles resist atrophy.

“NLRP3 is a key protein in a multiprotein complex called the inflammasome which drives inflammatory responses in the innate immune system” said Kristen Fortney Ph.D. BioAge's CEO and co-founder in an interview with BioSpace.

“Because NLRP3 inhibitors have such broad potential the whole field is trying to figure out which specific indications to tackle first. We’re going to learn a lot over the next two years as several programs across multiple companies advance into the early clinical stage” Fortney predicted.

“We believe NLRP3 inhibition is a promising strategy for treating diseases of brain aging as well as disorders driven by pathologic inflammation in other organ systems” she continued. “This idea is supported by an extensive body of literature showing that in interventional animal models decreasing NLRP3 pathway activity can increase longevity and prevent or reverse diverse diseases related to aging.”

Basically NLRP3 brings proinflammatory signals under control and Fortney said may possibly “reverse the effects of diseases in which inflammation is actively disrupting normal function and halt the progression of diseases driven by tissue destruction.”

This isn’t the first NLRP3 inhibitor to be developed though. Fortney said BioAge’s version is “structurally and mechanistically differentiated from previously known NLRP3 inhibitors” to minimize the safety issues that other molecules have encountered. BioAge’s preclinical studies show benefits in atherosclerosis hypertension neuroinflammation and other conditions.

The company is developing three classes of NLRP3 inhibitors: central nervous system penetrant peripherally-selective molecules and an ocular eye drop.

The CNS penetrant compounds cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore may address conditions driven by inflammation in the brain. In the second program the peripherally-selective molecules do not cross the blood-brain barrier.

“They accumulate at therapeutic levels in the systemic circulation” Fortney said and apply to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cardiovascular disease arthritis and other conditions. Inhibitors for these programs may be delivered orally or by infusion.

The third program an ocular NLRP3 is being developed as a topical eye drop. “We currently are evaluating our compounds to identify a lead candidate” Fortney said. Indications may include dry eye anterior uveitis and some forms of age-related blindness.

For all three programs BioAge is currently optimizing its lead candidates. It plans to perform IND-enabling studies in the coming year to evaluate toxicity and identify dosing Fortney said.

Splicing in Huntington’s Disease

In a different approach PTC Therapeutics is harnessing splicing machinery to lower huntingtin (HTT) protein production. The company is conducting a two-part study involving PTC518 which is being developed to treat Huntington’s disease.

Part one showed a reduction of huntingtin protein levels in healthy volunteers. Part two currently underway is a global study that looks at huntingtin RNA and protein levels in the blood as well as levels within the brain.

“We identified splicing modifiers that cross the blood-brain barrier and uniformly lower huntingtin protein levels in the key affected areas of a Huntington’s disease mouse brain"" said Anuradha Bhattacharyya Ph.D. executive director biology and nucleotide repeat diseases during the conference.

That finding represents a paradigm shift in terms of what is possible.

“Twenty years ago most people thought splicing was something that happened that couldn’t be modulated” said Stuart Peltz Ph.D. co-founder and CEO of PTC. But Peltz realized that RNA was a “primordial soup” type enzyme that could form into structures with catalytic activity. “Therefore those structures just like proteins form pockets that small molecules can modulate.”

Digging deeper he noted that the five- and three-prime sites mark the ends of the exon/intron boundaries and that the machinery that binds and ultimately leads to splicing has a specific sequence.

“Most (organizations) lack the molecules in their chemical libraries that are needed for a splicing modification approach to work well” Peltz said after an analysis of one big pharma company’s million compound library. Now after 20 years “We can look at every splice site in the gene and see if it's involved in a particular disease state.”

Spinal muscular atrophy is one example and Huntington’s and familial dysautonomia are other diseases that can be affected by modulating gene splicing.

“We figured out how to both use this technology and with a small molecule increase or decrease the level of a protein (that’s produced) to treat a disease” Peltz said.

Maximizing Success with a Multimodal Approach

Biogen is taking a multimodal approach to therapeutic discovery as Anabella Villalobos Ph.D. SVP biotherapeutics & medicinal sciences outlined at the Discovery on Target meeting.

She reason she told BioSpace afterward is “to enable a focus on the right target (proteins and/or nucleic acids) to maximize our probability of success in identifying new medicines.”

By identifying the best targets usually with genetic linkage Biogen “can narrow the gap in the undruggable space expand target space leverage synergies across modalities and offer multiple investigational options to patients in high-value biological targets or pathways” Villalobos said.

By leveraging multiple modalities the company can better explore its combinations and address any limitations. “For example” she said “we can enhance tissue delivery into [the] brain or muscle after systemic administration with oligonucleotide-antibody conjugates.”

Biogen can also target a variety of biological hypotheses related to a given disease regardless of the nature of the biological target she explained. This not only improves the chances of success but also expands treatment options by “offering options with potential medicines that may show complementary therapeutic benefit when used in combination.”

For example small molecules can reach the brain but have limited ability to modulate non-protein targets. Biogen therefore is pursuing small molecules that modulate RNA splicing. Biologics in contrast can achieve limited brain exposure.

So Biogen is leveraging new technologies involving longer half-lives and high selectivities to access disease areas that previously were not tractable for particular therapeutic modalities such as antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates Villalobos said. The company is also expanding oligonucleotide therapeutics beyond rare diseases accessing deeper brain areas.

During his visit he talked to the community about the sport of rugby league and encouraged young boys to continue playing sports.

PTC Compound touch footy association president Edwin Mulas says the visit by Mead and what he shared with the youngsters was worth it.

Mead and his family were warmly welcomed by bright smiles from the kids and excited fans who were all present to listen to him talk.

Mead talked about how he went to Australia and pursued a career in rugby league and what he learnt during his time spent in rugby league.

“During my time in rugby league I learnt some lessons and one of the best lessons I think I learnt was from coach Wayne Bennett.

“One thing he always tells us before every pre-season game is; when you’re in your locker room I don’t want to see any rubbish on the ground always put your rubbish together in the rubbish bin because if you leave your rubbish lying around it means you don’t respect other people. Other people have to pick it up for you.”

“So I try to live that life as well create a nice loving home for myself for my wife and my two sons. But with that come a lot of responsibilities within myself.”

Mead said he had to take responsibility to help him to get to where he is now.

“You always have to train hard work hard eat good food stay hydrated sleep well if you can do that in your own household you create a nice household. And if you can encourage your neighbours to do that that means there’s two household creating a nice loving home.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB0Y3B1bmphYmkuY28uaW4vbWFuLWJlaGluZC1tb29zZXRhcGVzLWludHJvLWd1cmluZGVyLWRpbXB5LWlzLW5vLW1vcmXSAVZodHRwczovL3d3dy5wdGNwdW5qYWJpLmNvLmluL2FtcC9tYW4tYmVoaW5kLW1vb3NldGFwZXMtaW50cm8tZ3VyaW5kZXItZGltcHktaXMtbm8tbW9yZQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man behind Moosetape’s Intro Gurinder Dimpy is no more,"Man behind Moosetape’s Intro Gurinder Dimpy is no more

Now that the weather’s cooled down it’s easy to forget that 10-day heat wave in early September when we came close to rolling blackouts.



About Those Outages

A report recently released from the California Independent System Operator (Cal ISO) the agency that oversees the power grid explains how the outages were avoided. Among the main reasons are:



The public heeded the call to conserve energy when that text alert hit phones.

A dramatic expansion in battery storage over the last two years helped store solar energy after the sun went down.

Increased coordination between grid operators across the West allowed California to import needed power from other states less impacted by the heat wave.

Why Increased Battery Storage Matters

Solar power goes down with the sun…but batteries can store that power. In 2020 the last time there were rolling outages California had just 250 megawatts of battery storage online.

Now the state can store 3500 megawatts for several hours at a time…enough power for some 2.6 million homes (however this number can fluctuate depending on the time of year time of day and other variables.)

“Across that heating event battery storage really proved its worth” said Elliot Mainzer who heads Cal ISO.

Mainzer said maintaining the pace of that buildout is an unprecedented challenge. He estimated the state needs another 120 gigawatts of power by 2040 to support increasing electrification in the effort to unhook from fossil fuels the burning of which to power homes cars and industry is the biggest single cause of global heating.

How Much Power Is In A Megawatt? There are 1000 megawatts in a single gigawatt. One megawatt equals one million watts or 1000 kilowatts roughly enough electricity to serve the demand of 750 homes at once according to Cal ISO. One caveat: the number of homes powered by a megawatt can fluctuate quite a bit because electricity use varies depending on the time of year time of day and other variables.

What We Need To Do To Get Off Fossil Fuels By 2045

If California is to stay on track to get off fossil fuels by 2045 the California Energy Commission estimates the rate of building battery storage needs to increase nearly eightfold.

Furthermore the physical transmission lines needed to get that clean power where it needs to go can take 10 to 15 years to come online Mainzer said.

Something else that helped with the heat wave this time around: the extreme heat wasn’t quite as broad-reaching as it was in 2020 allowing the state to import needed energy from states less hard hit.

“We were very fortunate during that event that while it was extraordinarily hot here in California and in Nevada and other parts of the West it wasn't quite that hot relatively in Arizona and the Pacific Northwest” Mainzer said. “To be able to trade energy and move power around and take advantage of the transmission connectivity and resource diversity that exists across the West…that really helped all of us maintain reliability.”

Some Roadblocks To Consider

But global greenhouse gas emissions continue going up and heat waves are only projected to get hotter longer and broader geographically in California and around the world.

Mainzer said grid operators are preparing by looking into ways to incentivize consumers to use less energy automate energy use through smart meters and feed the grid with their own excess energy from electric vehicles or rooftop solar panels.

UCLA engineering professor Rajit Gadh said the million electric vehicles in California today alone could be their own massive battery in conjunction with large-scale renewable energy run by utilities.

Back in 2009 his team at UCLA demonstrated in a years-long study how electric vehicles could serve as batteries for the grid.

“The person who is consuming is now producing energy and it's happening more and more” Gadh said. “Now the question is how do you make everything work together?”"

The project will be installed on 4500 acres of land and equipped with over 1.4 million modules across more than 13000 tracker rows. The project is expected to be one of the largest in the United States capable of producing enough clean energy to power 116000 average Ohio homes a year.

“By winning this project Array is further solidifying its position as a leader in the utility-scale solar industry and demonstrating our ability to consistently deliver quality products on time for our customers” said Kevin Hostetler CEO of Array Technologies. “This project is a win-win-win for the county in Ohio delivering clean energy into the local power grid providing hundreds of new construction jobs and generating a revenue stream from the lease agreements and tax revenue all while boosting economic development in the area and serving as a STEM resource for students interested in science sustainability and environmental learning.”

The project is expected to be operational in 2024 with Array initiating tracker deliveries in January 2023. The project’s engineering procurement and construction is being overseen by Blattner Energy a member of the Quanta Services family. Blattner is a diversified renewable energy engineering contractor providing construction solutions nationwide.

“This supply agreement is the latest between EDF Renewables and Array” said Art Del Rio VP of solar and storage strategic procurement at EDF Renewables North America. “The strength of this deeply established partnership with Array and EDF Renewables continues to grow with the execution of another tracker supply agreement for leading technology.”

At the forefront of this charge is Qualcomm which uses Arm technology to complete its PC solution. Microsoft has followed Apple toward Arm but unlike Apple it partnered with Qualcomm to get there. To chase this opportunity Qualcomm also bought Nuvia which on paper has better technology than Apple’s.

In response to this acquisition Arm pulled Nuvia’s license to prevent the advancement apparently forgetting that Qualcomm’s license already covered a similar effort. Given history there is a decent chance that Apple is at least partially behind this and is working to prevent the creation of a better solution than its own coupled with a premature move by Arm to increase profits from PC-targeted Arm solutions.

Let’s explore this litigation mess and we’ll close with my product of the week which is AMD’s latest Ryzen 7000 series processor.

The Coming PC Pivot

The PC market is moving from a heavy focus on localized performance to connectivity to cloud services and battery life.

On my last couple of trips I’ve noticed that airplane Wi-Fi which until now barely worked for web browsing and email now works for streaming. It’s still not fast enough to stream games but the jump in performance is notable. This was an area that significantly lagged home use and especially remote 5G performance and prevented this pivot.

It’s increasingly likely that this limiting factor will evaporate as we move to 6G in the second half of the decade making connectivity and battery life much more compelling. Assuming Qualcomm and Microsoft’s effort continues to be successful this would favor that solution over others.

Intel has already begun to shift its roadmap to this opportunity and it looks like it will be ready for the pivot. Intel’s solution which promises a hybrid approach with both the performance you need when you need it and the battery life and connectivity you want in a bi-model solution should provide a decent defense of its dominant PC market share.

AMD and Nvidia’s response to this trend is less defined particularly since Nvidia’s attempt to buy Arm fell through. But I expect both companies also see this opportunity and risk and are moving to address it.

Bad Timing

This means that if Qualcomm doesn’t execute sharply its advantage could evaporate due to an inability to perform and a successful pivot by the existing entrenched vendors. What Arm should be doing is throwing all of its support behind Qualcomm’s anything-but-certain gambit to assure better an Arm-focused outcome instead of trying to cripple the effort before it can get to critical mass.

On the economic side while I understand the desire to get a higher license fee for a part that will likely have a higher gross margin creating a market pivot comes with high costs. Anticipated extra gross margin would be consumed by marketing efforts and sales discounts designed to drive this Arm-favored pivot.

Put differently the time to negotiate a new pricing deal is after the effort is successful and Qualcomm has the extra income to make such an increase work — not when the company is trying to penetrate a hostile market and needs every financial resource it can get.

In short Arm acts as if Qualcomm is taking unfair advantage of Arm’s favorable pricing which might be sustainable if Qualcomm had already been successful. Even so Qualcomm’s existing license agreement would still have to be overcome but at least the numbers would work in its favor.

Anti-Competitive

Apple undoubtedly has a great deal of say at Arm since it has licensing terms that may be more favorable than Qualcomm’s. This last would likely be a closely held secret but consistent with deals I’ve seen with other Apple suppliers. Apple is known for getting deals that are so good its suppliers often wonder if they would have been better off passing on them.

As I see it Apple really doesn’t want an Arm solution particularly one blessed by Microsoft to be better than what it’s using. The Qualcomm solution using Nuvia’s technology looks to be substantially better. Apple already conceals higher margins that result from using cheaper technology in its premium lines — like avoiding touch screens that are common in competing PC products.

Having a significant performance disadvantage coupled with a lack of compelling cloud performance solutions would cost Apple a lot of its less religious base particularly creators.

Moving again to cripple Qualcomm so that its better solution doesn’t come to market would be consistent with what Apple attempted in prior efforts which included a backed hostile takeover by Broadcom and a bogus complaint with the FTC.

RISC-V Benefit

What really makes this interesting is that before this happened there was an anti-Arm effort coming from the RISC-V consortium. RISC-V has similar capabilities to Arm but a much more modern and licensee-friendly business model.

This model had already shifted a lot of developers from Arm to RISC-V so this ill-advised hostile action between Arm and one of its largest licensees has put a spotlight on RISC-V’s better (in terms of licensee benefits) business model.

Thanks to Nvidia’s failure to acquire Arm and the resulting IPO that funded Arm independence but didn’t adequately fund development Arm’s future revenues could be at risk which would impact its ability to do the debt financing it will need to advance its technology.

In the end Qualcomm and Microsoft should be looking more favorably at RISC-V over Arm due to this ill-timed and poorly considered legal action.

Wrapping Up

It is often the case that when companies are struggling they turn to litigation to make up for their operational problems. This rarely works because CEOs generally don’t understand how litigation actually works and as a result they put more faith in this approach than history justifies.

Arm is in trouble primarily because it depended on Nvidia acquiring it to fund its future growth and success and now it’s hungry for revenue. But a licensing model (both Arm and Qualcomm are licensing experts) requires trust between the parties and a deep understanding of the bigger picture so that the end result is successful and profitable for both entities.

Crippling Qualcomm at the front of a massive war against x86 is ill-advised given Qualcomm’s success was never assured and that Intel in particular seems to be successfully pivoting to address this threat to its market share.

To be successful Qualcomm needs Arm’s help. Instead Arm is hurting the effort to a degree that could cause it to fail. The obvious move for both Qualcomm and its Microsoft partner is to move to RISC-V thereby putting this entire issue in the rearview mirror.

Such a move would either kill Arm or more likely turn it into what would effectively be a poorly funded Apple subsidiary. That end would make Apple less competitive over time as well.

I think we are beginning to see the end of Arm and while Arm is likely to hold others responsible it will only have itself to blame.

AMD Ryzen 7000 Series Processor

For most of its life AMD has been subordinated to Intel. That’s how the PC market was conceived: Intel needed a second x86 vendor to meet IBM’s requirement that the part not be sole-sourced.

The relationship between Intel and AMD was anything but friendly because AMD didn’t like being subordinate to Intel and wanted more market share than Intel would allow. To be fair Intel was still doing most of the heavy lifting in terms of market creation and maintenance so it felt taken advantage of.

Last decade Intel tried to treat x86 as a cash cow and cut back significantly on development and ecosystem maintenance which allowed AMD first to catch up in terms of performance and then bypass Intel by a significant margin on servers workstations and PCs.

Intel maintained leadership in terms of the installed base compliance and overall resources but AMD took the performance crown. Intel is attempting to catch up and is as noted above pivoting aggressively to address the battery life and connectivity threat that Qualcomm represents.

But when it comes to PCs AMD’s Ryzen 7000 owns the performance crown at the moment. Though be aware that performance is relative and Intel’s 13th-generation parts look more competitive.

I’ve assembled my first Ryzen 7000 desktop system and one of the huge benefits is that as Intel did a few years back AMD has gotten rid of the pins on the chip which pretty much eliminates where many of us broke ours (breaking a pin on assembly was almost a given). In addition you no longer have to change the backing plate when adding a heavy air or water cooler.

All of this makes building a system faster and easier than before. So more power easier assembly and a nice result make the new Ryzen 7000 processor line my product of the week.

Going by the code name “Hamoa” this Qualcomm chip is reported to have eight Performance cores and four Efficiency cores and more interestingly a “similar mem/cache config as M1.”

The tweets even indicate that for the first time these chips could be paired with discrete graphics cards which would be a first for ARM-based PCs.

So where does all this promising performance come from? Well the tweets say this new chip is “based on the Nuvia Phoenix design” a CPU core architecture that is made by a startup company that includes ex-Apple and ex-Google processor engineers — and was purchased by Qualcomm in 2021. This upcoming Hamoa chip could end up being the first fruits of this acquisition and is possibly being delayed by Qualcomm’s ongoing legal feud with ARM.

These chips as Notebookcheck observes could appear in either laptop or desktop form factors providing this “extremely promising” performance to a wide variety of PCs and devices.

This news follows up the launch of what might be the most high-profile Windows on ARM device ever the Surface Pro 9. The device features the Microsoft SQ3 which is a customized version of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3. Microsoft is a big supporter of ARM-based Windows laptops and after the past two years of Apple’s M-series devices stealing the show the stakes have never been higher.

Yet for all the talk of Windows on ARM the promise of these devices still remains unfulfilled. Qualcomm has really been the only serious player in the game and its attempts to take on Intel AMD or Apple still haven’t produced the kinds of results that have laptop manufacturers and potential buyers convinced by. Qualcomm has so far had three generations of its Snapdragon 8cx SoC (system on chip) and the number of devices that have adopted these chips remain slim.

But if Qualcomm really does have a serious contender on its hands it’ll be fascinating to see how it shakes up the game.

Qualcomm acquired Nuvia in early 2021 featuring Apple silicon developers.

Qualcomm is expecting its next-gen processors for laptops and desktops to land in 2024.

A new report claims Qualcomm has a 12-core desktop chip with a discrete GPU with a “similar mem/cache config as [Apple’s] M1” processor.

Windows on ARM has had an exceptionally long road since it was first announced in 2016 (even earlier if you count Surface RT). Qualcomm Microsoft and software companies have been slowly improving the ecosystem but it still pales to Apple’s M1 and newer M2 ARM-like processors.

A new report from Kuba Wojciechowski aka @Za-Raczke on Twitter claims that one of Qualcomm’s next-gen Nuvia “Phoenix” designs for 2024 is targeting desktop use. Codenamed “Hamoa” the chip is claimed to feature 12 “in-house” cores made up of eight performance cores and four efficiency ones.

(Qualcomm acquired Nuvia in January 2021. The company was made up of ex-Apple engineers including the ones who designed Apple's A-series chips which went to evolve as the M-series for laptops and desktops.)

Interestingly the memory and cache configuration for “Hamoa” are also claimed to be similar to Apple’s M1.

In other news: Qualcomm's working on a 2024 desktop chip codename ""Hamoa"" with up to 12 (8P+4E) in-house cores (based on the Nuvia Phoenix design) similar mem/cache config as M1 explicit support for dGPUs and performance that is ""extremely promising"" according to my sources.November 6 2022

By comparison the Apple M1 has four high-performance ""Firestorm"" and four energy efficient ""Icestorm"" cores in a similar ARM big.LITTLE design (something Intel is now using in 12th and 13th Gen processors).

Oddly Wojciechowski who is known for his leaks about upcoming technology claims the processor is a “desktop chip” which is a bit unusual as we’d expect Qualcomm to hit laptops and mobile-first. Some room for interpretation is warranted here although pushing ARM-like chips to desktops is certainly feasible like Microsoft’s new Windows Dev Kit 2023 (“Project Volterra”) and Apple’s latest iMacs.

“Hamoa” is said to feature a discrete GPU (dGPU) which is not strange as ARM processors are currently not compatible with NVIDIA or AMD ones. That said we don’t know the details of Nuvia’s designs including if it supports Thunderbolt 4 and external GPUs so anything is possible.

But according to Wojciechowski’s source the new chip’s performance is “extremely promising” so take that as you will as there are no comparisons made to current gen Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 chips (as found in Microsoft's new Surface Pro 9 with 5G) or Apple’s M2 series let alone Intel’s 12th Gen mobile chips.

We also don’t know the manufacturing process levels of power consumption driver support and software technology behind the chips.

Recent news has Qualcomm claiming many ""design wins"" from OEM partners due to high interest. Qualcomm is also dealing with a lawsuit from Arm Ltd. which claims Qualcomm has breached license agreements and trademark infringement with its Nuvia designs.

Qualcomm is slated to host its annual Snapdragon Summit November 15 through November 17 so perhaps the company will shed some details on the status of its next-gen Nuvia chip designs and any expectations for performance.

Thanks for the tip Dennis Herbers!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL3F1YWxjb21tLW51dmlhLWNoaXAtMTItY29yZS1jcHUtc2hvd2luZy1leHRyZW1lbHktcHJvbWlzaW5nLXJlc3VsdHMv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93Y2NmdGVjaC5jb20vcXVhbGNvbW0tbnV2aWEtY2hpcC0xMi1jb3JlLWNwdS1zaG93aW5nLWV4dHJlbWVseS1wcm9taXNpbmctcmVzdWx0cy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Qualcomm’s First Nuvia-Based SoC to Feature 12-Core CPU Performance Results Are ‘Extremely Promising’ Claims Newest Info,"The first Nuvia-based chip from Qualcomm is not scheduled to appear before 2024 but that does not mean the company is not busy conducting some extensive tests on that very silicon. The newest information from unnamed sources claims a lot of positives about this mysterious SoC while stating that it will have a 12-core CPU configuration.

12-Core CPU Configuration to Be Divided Into Performance and Power-Efficiency Cores but Strangely the Info Claims That Qualcomm Is Working on a ‘Desktop’ Chip

The first chip is based on the Nuvia Phoenix design and features the codename ‘Hamoa.’ Qualcomm has already produced SoCs like the Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 to be used in thin-and-light Windows notebooks so we are not sure why Kuba Wojciechowski states that this silicon is a desktop one in this tweet below. Perhaps Qualcomm’s first Nuvia chip could be used in both classes of machine similar to what Apple did with its M1 as it was first incorporated into MacBooks then iMacs.

This ‘Hamoa’ seemingly possesses similar memory and cache configuration as Apple’s M1 and has support for dedicated GPUs. Assuming that the first family of Nuvia chips under the Snapdragon brand appear in notebooks these portable computers might be able to connect to external GPU enclosures using the Thunderbolt interface something which Apple does not allow anymore on its MacBook range.

This chip will also sport a 12-core CPU with eight performance and four power-efficiency cores featuring a custom design just like Apple. Wojciechowski’s sources have told him that the performance results of this Nuvia SoC are ‘extremely promising’ but did not excite us with some numbers so we will have to treat this information with a pinch of salt. To remind you Apple’s M1 Pro and M1 Max sport more performance cores than efficiency ones so it would not be uncommon for Qualcomm to stick with this configuration.

Sadly there is so much information that we do not have access to now. For instance which manufacturing process does Qualcomm intend to use? This metric will affect battery life and will remain a solid base for customers to actually ditch plans to purchase tried-and-tested x86-powered notebooks and spend money on something else. Also ‘extremely promising’ are two subjective words and can mean something else entirely. How capable is this Nuvia chip compared to the Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 or Apple’s M1?

It looks like we will have answers to all these questions and more in the coming months.

Originally published by American Heart Association

DALLAS November 7 2022 /CSRwire/ - According to the Association of American Medical Colleges only 8% of medical students and 5% of physicians are Black and African American. In an effort to address this disparity the American Heart Association the leading public health nonprofit organization dedicated to building a world of longer healthier lives for all has announced that 52 students from 23 academic institutions have been selected to participate in its Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Scholars program.

The Association’s HBCU Scholars are enrolled in biomedical or other health sciences programs at their respective institutions. Through their participation in the Scholars program they will study how the social determinants of health and other health disparities impact underserved communities. They will also participate in scientific research projects and present their findings at the end of the program.

“Since 2015 the American Heart Association HBCU Scholars program has helped change the trajectory of dozens of under-represented students in science and medicine by fostering their talent preparedness and growth to pursue careers in biomedical science” said American Heart Association volunteer president Michelle A. Albert M.D. M.P.H. FAHA who is the Walter A. Haas-Lucie Stern endowed chair in Cardiology professor of medicine and admissions dean at University of California-San Francisco School of Medicine. “As champions for health care quality and access for all the American Heart Association is committed to building the pipeline of diverse persons in medicine and empowering the next generation of research and health care professionals.”

The program is funded by a grant provided by the Quest Diagnostics Foundation which also supports the American Heart Association’s Hispanic Serving Institutes (HSI) Scholars Program.

“This program plays an essential role in supporting the pipeline of Black students who will increase representation and equity in the health care field” said Mandell Jackson vice president and general manager Quest for Health Equity Quest Diagnostics. “We are proud to support this next cohort of HBCU Scholars with the American Heart Association as it provides them with enriching academic and networking experiences to help them excel in their career paths.”

Accepted students are selected based on their GPA completion of a formal application which includes an essay and an official recommendation from their school. During the program scholars are paired with a mentor who works in health care or is currently performing their own relevant scientific research. They will also participate in a leadership development program and are awarded a financial stipend to help cover education-related expenses. More about the American Heart Association’s HBCU Scholars initiative can be found here.

Clinical research studies published in the American Journal of Public Health suggest that patients of color may experience uncomfortable interactions and communication barriers with their health care providers due to lack of diversity and face implicit and unconscious bias from physicians and other health care professionals. These barriers in turn can lower patients’ trust in the overall health care system and as a result these patients may not complete prescribed treatments or follow-up on recommended care. Addressing this issue is a vital component of the HBCU Scholars program.

Each year the Association seeks applications from sophomores juniors and seniors from historically underrepresented communities who are currently enrolled in an HBCU and are interested in pursuing a professional degree in biomedical and health sciences.

A few common problems rob older people of their ability to move freely. Joint injuries an exceedingly high body mass index and a lack of lower body strength are the main musculoskeletal factors that limit mobility for aging adults.

Although joint injuries are largely the result of accidents the other two factors often can be prevented. This week I'll present a few prevention tips and will introduce an exercise that's perfect for the older adult.

About a month ago my mother took a fall and fractured her ankle in three places. It was a traumatic injury that required surgery and she has been reliant on a wheelchair and walker as she works through the physical therapy process. She will be 70 next year and I want to help her regain her mobility for good.

Accidents do happen and we're lucky that her injury wasn't worse. She will heal and recover but her lower body will be weak when she does. So I have already started talking to her about a post-rehabilitation program to prevent excess mass and lack of strength.

Body mass index is the first key as the lower body is less capable of maintaining mobility for older adults with obesity (30+ BMI). The latest CDC data indicate that 41.9% of all U.S. adults are obese and Arkansas ranks just about average at 38.7%. BMI can be changed through lifestyle modification. Good nutrition physical activity and regular habits can all bring BMI levels below 30 which will positively affect overall mobility.

The other area that I've talked to my mother about is her lower body strength. Strength goes hand in hand with BMI because the key to remaining ambulatory is a high strength-to-weight ratio. The legs need to get stronger as body weight decreases. So we're working on simple exercises that will improve strength in the quadriceps gluteals hamstrings and calves.

The squat exercise is among the most effective lower body movements as it mimics one key activity of daily living — standing up from a seated position.

We work on chair squats and other options but this week's exercise is designed to provide assistance for those who find the unassisted squat difficult to manage. The Bar Assisted Squat is perfect for older adults or beginners looking to improve lower body strength.

1. Stand in front of a Smith machine with your feet shoulder width apart. Position the machine bar at waist level.

2. Place both hands on the bar with your arms fully outstretched.

3. Press your hips back and squat down until your knees and hips are both at 90 degrees.

4. Drive through the heels to stand back up.

5. Perform two sets of 12.

I love this exercise because it's effective and safe. For added safety place a bench behind you in case the legs tire out in the middle of the set. The Smith machine bar provides much needed stability for those working on establishing some lower body strength so they can remain mobile for years to come.

In August Eisai Inc. cut the ribbon on a 15-story 332800-square-foot space that serves as the hub for the company which is the U.S. pharmaceutical subsidiary of Tokyo-based Eisai Co. Ltd. “We try and create an environment where everyone understands they matter” Alex Scott executive vice president Integrity at Eisai told NJBIZ. “They deeply matter. They’re not just a cog in the wheel.”

Eisai executives recently gave NJBIZ a tour of its new state-of-the-art Eisai hhceco Center headquarters at the ON3 Campus in Nutley formerly the site of Roche’s headquarters.

“The official grand opening of the Eisai US hhceco Center reinforces our 30-year commitment to New Jersey and signifies the beginning of a new chapter as we establish an ecosystem platform to collaborate with industry government medical organizations and the community to deliver breakthrough medicines and new solutions that alleviate the health concerns of people so they can live healthier and more fulfilling lives” said Ivan Cheung chairman and CEO of Eisai Inc. global Alzheimer’s Disease officer and senior corporate officer Eisai Co. Ltd. at the ceremony. “We are so honored to celebrate this important milestone for our company with such an esteemed group of dignitaries and contributors to the New Jersey life sciences community.”

While the ribbon was cut in August Eisai began moving into the facility in early 2022 from its previous Woodcliff Lake headquarters with an earlier opening ceremony held in May.

The move coincided with the pandemic as Eisai signed the lease in May 2020. Eisai had already been planning an innovative and collaborative space for its 800 employees. As companies face the challenges of getting employees back to the office the features and amenities Eisai offers at the new space seem even more timely.

Key features of the headquarters include: a dedicated space and resources to educate and motivate employees; a forum to hear from patients advocacy partners and the community; an expansive cafeteria with chefs and a wide array of food choices café bars and a tech lab based on the Apple Genius Bar; a wellness center with a multi-purpose space that offers health classes and meditation; an auditorium; sweeping views of North Jersey and the Manhattan skyline; and more.

At the heart of the company is its “hhc” mission which stands for human health care a phrase stressed from the top by Eisai’s Global CEO Haruo Naito that aims to address health care’s most pressing challenges.

“The Company’s Corporate Philosophy is to give first thought to patients and their families and to increase the benefits that health care provides to them” the company said in a statement. “Under this Philosophy the Company endeavors to become a human health care (hhc) company.”

The concept of hhc is to avoid sitting in a tower and not engaging with patients. And the new facility offers an opportunity to expand the ecosystem for that mission with the next phase of hhceco which is about building alliances and partnerships to be more proactive about changing the course of disease and health.

“Empowering people to realize their fullest life” the company said.

“It’s not just for treating diseases but how do you prevent disease” Scott explained.

That spirit of collaboration ties in with Prism Capital Partners LLC’s ON3 campus which is building a robust life sciences and innovation ecosystem including Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine Seton Hall College of Nursing and School of Health and Medical Sciences Quest Diagnostics and Hackensack Meridian Center for Discovery and Innovation combined with Eisai’s research and development forming a critical mass of potential innovation in the decades ahead.

Having those stakeholders rooted in the campus was a huge attraction for Eisai. The history of the land was also a factor in the decision to relocate. Naito described the former Roche site as sacred ground that served as inspiration for Eisai.

And along with the collaborative hhc spirit innovation serves as an area of focus for Eisai.

“The idea is this is a space where we can have patient groups and advocacy organizations come and engage with our employees and interact” said Scott. “And we are even asking advocacy organizations if they want to use it for patient support groups.”

Scott said the company wants a space where staff can meet the community to collaborate and gain useful input working toward ideas and solutions that will help people.

“This is the spirit of the building” he said.

Another objective for Eisai has been establishing itself in the Nutley and Clifton communities an effort that has included supporting local organizations such as the Clifton Boys and Girls Club Relay for Life in Clifton and Nutley and the Nutley Chamber of Commerce.

Scott credited the community for its support. “They’ve welcomed us with open arms” he said. “They’re really excited that we’re here.”

“The Township of Nutley is thrilled that Eisai has chosen the ON3 campus to relocate its state-of-the-art facility. We welcome them to our community and are excited about the future” Nutley Mayor Dr. Joseph Scarpelli told NJBIZ. “With the current 800 Eisai employees and the potential to have up to 1300 jobs at full capacity their relocation to Nutley will help bring quality employment opportunities for our residents stimulate our local and the regional economy and allows for partnership with our local charitable organizations.”

“This is just another part of the huge success of redevelopment of the Roche site” Clifton Mayor James Anzaldi said noting that once that site closed local officials were forced to take the lemon and make lemonade.

“It certainly is happening with the medical school and Quest and now this new company all coming together for a corporate park that will be second to none” Anzaldi added. “The company seems to be community-minded and that is another important part of every large corporate citizen of any city.”

“We are happy to welcome Eisai to Essex County” Essex County Executive Joseph DiVincenzo said a statement. “The amount of people they will employ and their impact on the local economy will breathe new life into the former Hoffman LaRoche site and return much needed ratables that will help stabilize Nutley and Clifton. We are proud they chose to relocate their headquarters to Essex County and look forward to a long relationship.”

Scott said the company plans to continue to get to know the community and expand interactions with neighbors. And employees have been extremely pleased with the new digs and the new community. In addition to the draw as a life sciences hub Scott said the location itself right on Route 3 and near Manhattan is an asset to attract and retain talent as well as help expand collaboration partnerships clinical trials and internships.

Scarpelli stressed just how much progress has been made on the campus.

“What only a few short years ago was a shuttered site is now a world-class redevelopment with 5500 employees faculty and students; combining pharmaceutical research and development medical education diagnostics biotechnology biopharma and corporate on a still expandable 116-acre site located within 9 miles of Manhattan and surrounded by 26 institutions of higher learning” said Scarpelli. “The future collaboration among those already on this campus can only bring groundbreaking discoveries and treatment. It’s truly an exciting time not only for Nutley and Clifton but New Jersey.”

“There’s a lot that can be done right here” said Scott noting those top-notch educational resources to help develop the educated workforce they need.

In the meantime the company continues its transition to its new headquarters and the community one that had the added hurdle of a pandemic to navigate and is squarely at the center of the redevelopment of an iconic New Jersey piece of land. “The rest of the site we’re really looking forward to getting built out to make this a lot more dynamic” Scott said.

“The Township is committed to partnering with Eisai to further their mission of delivering life changing therapies and healthcare solutions and share their vision for a world free from cancer Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases” said Scarpelli.",,,

The Fortnite x Polo collaboration will be the next big event coming to Fortnite. From November 5 2022 Fortnite players will be able to drop into the battle royal kitted out in the latest fashion.

The skins and accessories are inspired by Ralph Lauren’s 1992 Stadium Collection known as the iconic streetwear fashion that combined the kits of auto-racing and aviation. The skins look really cool but is it worth the price tag?

If you want to get these items the skin bundle will cost you 1500 V Bucks or $11.99 / £9.74 / AUD$18.56 not to mention all the other accessories.

Trendy collabs

V bucks are Epic Games' most lucrative asset when it comes to Fortnite. This currency is the gateway to all the new sought-after skins items and dances. If you want to purchase these at a discounted price then getting the Battle Pass is the way to go but this will still cost you $7.99 / £6.49 / AUD$12.38 separately.

No matter where you look monetization is unavoidable in Fortnite. This is true for any free-to-play game; Epic Games needs to make money somehow. However Fornite also has a noticeably younger audience who can be impressionable when it comes to the latest trends.

It’s easy to associate Fortnite with its skins and accessories as the cosmetics are front and center in every new seasonal update. In the blog post announcing the collaboration Epic describes the partnership with Polo as combining “courage perseverance and style” which seems a bit much for a couple of virtual skins.

Ethical shopping

The widespread acceptance of Epic Games’ approach to monetization in Fortnite will have a wider impact on live service games as a whole. Many games have shifted to free-to-play models to create a cash cow that’ll drip them profits through Battle Passes and in-game purchases.

(Image credit: Epic Games)

Overwatch 2 is a great example of this transition. While I love the new abilities heroes and map designs in Blizzard’s hero shooter the Achilles Heel in Overwatch 2 is the in-game purchases. The cost of items is ridiculous and if you don’t pony up it will literally take you more than 300 years to unlock everything in the game .

If this is the impact of Blizzard focusing on a ‘Fortnite generation’ a group of players grown used to seasonal cosmetic microtransactions even expectant of them then it will likely become the norm for smaller developers to follow suit.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9tZW5zd2Vhci1uZXdzL21lbnMtZmFzaGlvbi9lZmZyZXktYmFua3Mtc3BlY2lhbC1hbm5pdmVyc2FyeS1hd2FyZC1jZmRhLTEyMzU0MDUzNTAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CFDA 60th Anniversary: Jeffrey Banks to Receive Special Anniversary Award,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9tZW5zd2Vhci1uZXdzL21lbnMtZmFzaGlvbi9lZmZyZXktYmFua3Mtc3BlY2lhbC1hbm5pdmVyc2FyeS1hd2FyZC1jZmRhLTEyMzU0MDUzNTAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF2F433A0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9tZW5zd2Vhci1uZXdzL21lbnMtZmFzaGlvbi9lZmZyZXktYmFua3Mtc3BlY2lhbC1hbm5pdmVyc2FyeS1hd2FyZC1jZmRhLTEyMzU0MDUzNTAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlZWl0bWFya2V0LmNvbS90aGVzZS0zLWNvbXBhbmllcy1hcmUtc2V0LXVwLXRvLXJlcG9ydC1iYWQtbmV3cy10aGlzLXdlZWsv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These 3 Companies Are Set Up to Report Bad News This Week,"The following research was contributed to by Christine Short VP of Research at Wall Street Horizon.

Corporate profit growth heads into the final peak week of Q3 earnings season stronger than it began. With 85% of companies reporting at this point S&P 500 EPS growth for the quarter remains at 2.2% unchanged from last week. This is a 0.5 percentage point decrease from where expectations stood on Sept 30 and marks the lowest growth rate in two years. (Data from FactSet)

As with every earnings season a majority of blue chip names are beating analysts’ expectations but at a much lower rate for Q3.

Currently 70% of companies have surpassed sell-side profit expectations as compared to the 5-year average of 77%. The percentage by which companies are beating is also subdued at just 2.2% vs. the 10-year average of 6.5%. (Data from FactSet).

Forward looking estimates are also being revised downward with Q4 expectations turning negative in the last week now anticipated to report a YoY decline of 1%. Calendar year 2023 estimates still remain inflated at 5.9% but that number has started to fall (from 8.1% on September 30) as analysts downgrade due to the strong dollar economic slowdown and the fall of some big tech names.

Despite the volatile earnings season companies continue to engage in and authorize share repurchase programs a benefit to shareholders. It is expected that 2022 will be a record for total dollars used to buy back stocks at an estimated $1T surpassing the previous record last year which topped $900M. This is ahead of the new 1% buyback excise tax set to begin in January 2023.

What will the Last Week of Peak Earnings Season Bring?

This week we get Q3 results from 33 S&P 500 companies from a smattering of sectors. Big names to watch include Lyft (LYFT) after their recent announcement of a significant workforce reduction TripAdvisor (TRIP) for a further read on the travel industry and Walt Disney (DIS) for an update on the streaming wars. We also start to get results from some apparel and accessories names such as Tapestry (TPR) Ralph Lauren (RL) and Warby Parker (WRBY).

Potential Surprises in the Week Ahead

This week we get results from a number of large companies on major indexes that have pushed their Q3 earnings dates past their historical norms. Five companies within the S&P 500 confirmed outlier earnings dates for this week all of which are later than usual and therefore have negative DateBreaks Factors*. Those five names are The Mosaic Company (MOS) NiSource (NI) DuPont de Nemours (DD) Steris (STE) and Becton Dickinson & Company (BDX).

NiSource Inc (NI)

Company Confirmed Report Date: Monday November 7 BMO

Projected Report Date (based on historical data): Wednesday November 2 BMO

DateBreaks Factor: -3*

NiSource typically reports Q3 results during the first week of November and they have done so for the last 8 years. There is no day of the week trend but over the last four years NI has reported on a Monday or Wednesday. The confirmed report date of November 7 is five days later than forecasted potentially signaling bad news will be delivered on the upcoming call.

DuPont de Nemours (DD)

Company Confirmed Report Date: Tuesday November 8 BMO

Projected Report Date (based on historical data): Tuesday November 1 BMO

DateBreaks Factor: -3*

Dupont historically has reported Q3 results during the last week of October or the first week of November on a Tuesday or Thursday. As such a report date of November 2 was set. On October 20 DD confirmed an earnings report date of November 8 the latest they’ve reported third quarter results in our 7 year history for that name. This also continues the trend started last year of Tuesday reports after regularly reporting on Thursdays.

Becton Dickinson & Company (BDX)

Company Confirmed Report Date: Thursday November 10 BMO

Projected Report Date (based on historical data): Thursday November 3 BMO

DateBreaks Factor: -3*

Becton Dickinson & Company typically reports their fiscal Q4 results during the first week of November on a Tuesday or Thursday. On October 13 the company confirmed they would release results on November 10 their latest report date in our 10 years of BDX data. This suggests they will share bad news on the call.

Q3 2022 Earnings Wave – Peak Season Continues

This is the last peak week of Q3 earnings season with 3026 companies anticipated to report (out of our universe of 10000 global names). November 10 will be the heaviest report day of the week with 880 companies expected to report. Thus far 80% of companies have confirmed their earnings date and 47% have reported.

In a filing with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas last month Sandra Ling Designs Inc. and its owner Sandra Ling offered to allow a judgment to be entered against them including a $603000 sum and a permanent injunction and also moved to drop the counterclaims they lodged against Louis Vuitton in order to bring the case to a close.

The case got its start in February 2021 when Louis Vuitton filed suit against Sandra Ling Designs Inc. and Ms. Ling (collectively “SLD”) alleging that the two defendants were running afoul of federal trademark law by offering up apparel handbags and accessories made from “purportedly authentic pre-owned” Louis Vuitton goods that they altered by “disassembl[ing] and deconstruct[ing]” to craft new products and/or by “adding decorations such as tassels stones or beading.” While the goods continued to “prominently” bear Louis Vuitton trademarks the luxury goods titan argued that the “fundamental alterations” made by SLD turned the allegedly authentic Louis Vuitton products into ones that “do not meet Louis Vuitton’s strict quality standards” and thus are “no longer genuine Louis Vuitton products.”

Upcycling & the First Sale Doctrine

By focusing on the extensiveness of the alterations which resulted in products that “no longer attain the aesthetic or quality of authentic Louis Vuitton items” Louis Vuitton appeared to be looking to proactively chip away at any first sale doctrine arguments that the wholesaler defendants might raise as first sale protections do not apply when an unauthorized party sells products that are “materially different” from those sold by the brand and/or its authorized retailers. Unsurprisingly SLD responded to Louis Vuitton’s lawsuit by claiming that its activities fall neatly within the realm of “upcycling” and thus it should be shielded from liability by the first sale doctrine.

In its September 2021 answer SLD admitted that “without specific authorization” from Louis Vuitton it “designs makes and sells wholesale upcycled goods” which it constructs from “genuine authentic pre-owned (i.e. used/discarded/salvaged) LV items which SLD typically dissembles and/or deconstructs for recycling or upcycling and that those materials from those LV items can and often do show marks or portions of marks which LV claims are its trademarks that LV imprinted or imbedded or otherwise permanently formed or placed in the materials.”

While the defendants made some admissions in this vein in their answer they denied that consumers would “readily or reasonably think that the upcycled goods are sourced from or sponsored or approved by Louis Vuitton … since they are upcycled (or recycled) goods made from genuine authentic used and discarded products.” Also part of the reason why consumers were unlikely to be confused about the nature/source of its wares per SLD: Its inclusion of language with “each upcycled good” in which it disclaims any affiliation with or connection to Louis Vuitton and states that “the purchaser of the upcycled product ‘understands and acknowledges that the product is not a Louis Vuitton product.’”

In addition to answering Louis Vuitton’s complaint SLD lodged claims of its own seeking a declaration from the court that its sales of the “upcycled” goods amounts to “fair use of LV’s trademarks and does not constitute an infringement of LV’s trademarks” arguing that Louis Vuitton “through misrepresentation and improper use of its trademarks sought to prevent [SLD] from making and selling upcycled goods comprising material salvaged from used and discarded but genuine and authentic LV products.” SLD also set out a claim of tortious interference with existing and prospective business relations under Texas law on the basis that Louis Vuitton “willfully and intentionally interfered with [its] ongoing and potential business relationships.”

Fast forward to last month and the parties appear to be winding down the suit with counsel for Louis Vuitton accepting SLD’s offer of judgment and SLD moving to drop its counterclaims.

A String of Cases

The Sandra Ling case comes amid a rise in customization and upcycling-centric battles as luxury goods companies and sportswear giants alike look to crack down on what they have characterized as attempts by third parties to piggyback on – and profit from – the appeal of their brands by making unauthorized use of their famous marks. Nike for example has pursued such claims against customizers of its famous footwear including MSCHF while Rolex has taken on parties like La Californienne over its sale of modified watches bearing Rolex trademarks. Beyond that Ralph Lauren filed suit against VNDS Los Angeles a couple of years ago over its sale of “retro inspired custom apparel and accessories” made from Ralph Lauren products.

And still yet Chanel is currently facing off against Shiver + Duke over the defendant jewelry company’s sale of jewelry crafted from allegedly authentic Chanel buttons setting out claims of trademark infringement unfair competition and trademark dilution against the company early last year.

These cases raise some interesting questions as companies appear to be actively testing the bounds of their rights in order to exert control over where how and by whom products bearing their names and other trademarks are sold. This includes secondary market offerings with luxury brands – and even more mass-market entities like Nike and co. – grappling with trademark issues as a result of the rise of the burgeoning resale market. At a high level these cases also pit circularity/sustainability-related issues – which are commonly cited by upcyclers – against brand enforcement issues which companies argue are a critical element in their ability to maintain robust trademark rights and keep the goodwill associated with those marks (and corresponding pricing power) intact.

With the exception of the Hamilton watch case for instance which saw the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuitdetermine that defendant Vortic LLC did not run afoul of trademark law by selling restored and modified watches consisting of original Hamilton parts and bearing Hamilton’s branding (as Vortic’s use of the Hamilton trademark is not likely to confuse consumers) most of the upcycling cases have not provided much guidance by way of substantive decisions from the courts.

But even without a long list of decisions these cases provide some insight as they drive home the point that even with the first sale doctrine at play upcycling is not always fair game. Whether a company can upcycle goods without landing on the opposite end of lawsuits waged by luxury titans and sportswear behemoths will depend not only on the state of the resold product itself but also the terms/conditions in which it is offered up for sale and in many cases may call into question potential disclosures or disclaimers made by the upcyclers and their effectiveness at lessening the potential for confusion.

Moving forward a rising number of companies – from Patagonia to brands like Stella McCartney to Louis Vuitton – are upcycling their own wares and archival materials in order to reduce their environmental impact. Such in-house efforts will inevitably raise the stakes even further on the upcycling front meaning more litigation will likely come into play.

The case is Louis Vuitton Malletier v. Sandra Ling Designs Inc. et al. 4:21-cv-00352 (S.D.Tex.).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY2puLmNhL2xpdmVzL2FsdmluLXNlZ2FsLW9iaXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary: Alvin Segal 89 was the leading man of suits in Montreal—and his infatuation with Yiddish theatre motivated ...,"Alvin Cramer Segal always enjoyed a good story seen in his love of theatre and the drama of his own life he knew could compete with any fiction.

Segal who died on Nov. 4 at age 89 didn’t quite come from rags but his ability to turn them into riches became legendary.

Peerless Clothing Inc. under his stewardship grew into one of the largest suppliers of high-end men’s suits in North America holding the license for such labels as Ralph Lauren Calvin Klein and Michael Kors.

Segal was also a leading spokesman for the Canadian apparel manufacturing industry helping shape government policy.

His wealth allowed him to become an outstanding philanthropist. His family’s $24-million donation in 2005 to the Jewish General Hospital for the creation of the Segal Cancer Centre was one of the largest of its kind at the time.

But he will probably be best remembered for his rescue of the Saidye Bronfman Centre—now the Segal Centre for Performing Arts—a couple of years later motivated largely by Segal’s infatuation with Yiddish theatre.

Segal has been called a visionary entrepreneur and one of the most knowledgeable people in employing technology to produce fine apparel. Segal’s foresight served him and the struggling garment industry in Canada most spectacularly in his recognizing what a boost free trade with the United States would be opening up a market 10 times the size of that in Canada.

Segal was named a member of the Order of Canada in 2002 (promoted to officer in 2010) for his “pivotal role” in advising Ottawa during the negotiations that led to the 1989 Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement and later the North American Free Trade Agreement.

A native of Albany N.Y. 18-year-old Segal realized he was not university bound and came to Montreal in 1951 to work in his stepfather’s clothing factory. He started at the bottom toiling on the floor.

Even after he rose to chairman and chief executive officer of Peerless Segal never lost his sweet unassuming persona—at least outside business. Within he was known as one tough customer.

Numerous condolences speak of his kindness constant smile and loyalty as a friend. According to his family his motto was: “Don’t look back you’ll only get a crick in your neck.”

In his 2017 memoir My Peerless Story: It Starts with the Collar Segal recounts how he transformed a small family business from “the collar down and from the ground up” relying heavily on intuition. Improving fabrics and modernizing machinery to make the “engineered suit” led to Peerless becoming the main source of designer labels for major department stores.

When the FTA came into effect Segal seized the opportunity to enter the American market and eventually almost all of his company’s clothes were exported to the U.S.

Segal became president of the Canadian Men’s Clothing Manufacturers Association.

Following a company tradition Segal said he donated his first paycheck at Peerless to Combined Jewish Appeal and “I haven’t looked back since” when it came to charitable giving.

The Jewish community Israel and Montreal in general have been beneficiaries of the Alvin Segal Family Foundation especially in the arts health care and education. It has made large donations to McGill University Health Centre Concordia and McGill Universities (notably to its Jewish teacher training program) Centraide of Greater Montreal the Jewish Public Library and the Governor General’s Performing Arts Awards.

He was chairman of the Segal Centre for Performing Arts board for many years playing a hands-on role in its welfare and creating an endowment for it.

Besides the Order of Canada Segal was inducted into the National Order of Quebec and named a Great Montrealer.

In a statement the Segal administration said that thanks to his support the centre has “thrived and become a leading player in the development of Canadian theatre. Simply put we would not be here without him…”

“Nothing brought him more joy than the Dora Wasserman Yiddish Theatre. He would show up with danish pastries and pizza in hand for our volunteers and took pride in the personal recordings of the productions” said Segal executive and artistic director Lisa Rubin.

Segal once said “Art brings people together and is a positive force in society. My passion is to make this a cultural centre like you’ve never seen in Montreal.”

Friend Arthur Roskies said “My one outstanding memory of him was sitting beside him at a play at the Segal Centre and he was mouthing and virtually anticipating by a second what the actors were about to say on the stage. He confided to me that it was the sixth time he had seen the play and that he sees all the productions more than once. It showed me how dedicated he was to his centre—it was his baby.”

“Together with the board of directors we mourn the passing of a visionary who personified the importance of philanthropy for the arts in paving the way for the timely art institution that the Segal Centre is today. We are honoured to carry on his work and legacy” stated board president Sylvi Plante.

Segal is survived by his wife Emmelle his children Joel Barbara and Renee and their families."

While PCB of the GeForce RTX 4080 FE resembles PCB of the GeForce RTX 4090 FE there are significant differences between the two designs.

Just like the designs of Nvidia's Founders Edition graphics cards are similar so are the designs of the company's printed circuit boards since they use similar cooling systems. Designs of the GeForce RTX 4080 FE and GeForce RTX 4090 FE PCBs are similar too and both boards use the same 12VHPWR auxiliary power connector. But since the former board is rated for 320W of graphics power whereas the RTX 4090 FE has a power consumption of up to 450W the RTX 4080 FE has fewer power stages as well as fewer capacitors. Also because the AD103 GPU features a 256-bit memory interface while the AD102 processor has a 384-bit memory bus the RTX 4080 FE uses fewer of Micron's GDDR6X memory chips.

The AD103 GPU based on the Ada Lovelace architecture is considerably smaller compared to the AD102 processor. This is not something particularly surprising as the AD103 packs 45.9 billion transistors and has a die size of 378.6 mm^2 whereas the AD102 comprises of 76.3 billion of transistors and has a die size of 608.5 mm^2. Since the AD103 chip is relatively small it also does not feature a metallic frame on its sides.

Since Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4080 Founders Edition is not yet available officially @KittyYYuko had to place a CPU and an EKWB sticker on the board in a bid to hide certain details that could identify the source of the card. This of course hides the number of power phases featured by the GeForce RTX 4080 FE but since the product is set to become available next week we will learn this information soon enough.

In addition to sharing photos of the GeForce RTX 4080 Founders Edition and AD103 the leaker also published its 3DMark TimeSpy Extreme benchmark result of 14100 points which is in line with other RTX 4080 performance leaks. Such performance numbers are good enough to likely make Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4080 one of the best graphics cards for gaming set to be available this year although it will be interesting to see how AMD's new RX 7900 graphics cards compete when they arrive in mid-December.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3ZWFrdG93bi5jb20vbmV3cy84OTM4Mi9nYWlud2FyZC1yZXBsYWNpbmctZmF1bHR5LWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTQwOTAtcG93ZXItY2FibGVzLWluLWF1c3RyYWxpYS9pbmRleC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GAINWARD replacing faulty GeForce RTX 4090 power cables in Australia,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3ZWFrdG93bi5jb20vbmV3cy84OTM4Mi9nYWlud2FyZC1yZXBsYWNpbmctZmF1bHR5LWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTQwOTAtcG93ZXItY2FibGVzLWluLWF1c3RyYWxpYS9pbmRleC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF12A4FD0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3ZWFrdG93bi5jb20vbmV3cy84OTM4Mi9nYWlud2FyZC1yZXBsYWNpbmctZmF1bHR5LWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTQwOTAtcG93ZXItY2FibGVzLWluLWF1c3RyYWxpYS9pbmRleC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9nYWlud2FyZC10by1yZXBsYWNlLXJ0eC00MDkwLXBvd2VyLWFkYXB0ZXItY2FibGVzLXJldGFpbGVyLWNsYWltc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GAINWARD to replace RTX 4090 power adapter cables retailer claims,"Update

Gainward has released a short statement clarifying that the company is not replacing any cables.

⚠️Clarification⚠️There is incorrect information suggesting Gainward is delaying the RTX 4090 shipment to replace the cables lately. Here we would like to clarify that- Gainward is not holding any RTX 40 shipment to replace the cables and has no plan to do so.

The cables Gainward currently used on the RTX 40 have been inspected by NVIDIA team and found no issues. All Gainward shipment is being made as usual. Please don’t hesitate to grab the Gainward graphics cards if you plan to buy one! — Gainward on Facebook

Gainward will reportedly replace RTX 4090 power cables

According to Redditor ‘varunbabu008’ Australian retailer TechFast is now delaying the shipment of GeForce RTX 4090 graphics cards until mid-November.

The reason for the delay is reportedly Gainward’s decision to replace the 12VHPWR adapter for their RTX 4090 GPUs. This change has not been communicated by Gainward or NVIDIA. However the retailer claims that this change will affect other board partners as well.

The retailer expects Gainward to provide replacement cables by mid-November which is when the orders can be fulfilled. According to the retailer the change is likely due to reported issues of overheating/melting.

What is worth noting is that reported cases of melting power cables are no longer limited just to the power adapters but also to native 12VHPWR implementations at least two cases have already been reported. It is however a very small number of cases yet this topic has remained one of the most popular ones on NVIDIA forums such as Reddit.

NVIDIA has not yet issued an official statement while RTX 4090 graphics cards continue to be sold. Many articles and videos were made on a subject but the conclusions are not always the same. The issue may affect certain types of adapters/cables or be related to not properly seated connectors. What is clear is that no such issues should ever happen on a premium design like RTX 4090.

At the Radeon RX 7000 announcement AMD has been vocal about their cards not requiring any adapters to work. The new RDNA3 GPUs retain the old 8-pin power connector available with all modern ATX 2.0 power supplies. The only requirement is the appropriate wattage as declared by the graphics card maker.

I have been building my stock portfolio for most of my adult life and have positions in about 40 different companies right now. I own different stocks for different reasons. Some are exciting growth opportunities some are tried-and-true winners and some are excellent income investments.

One stock in particular that has all of these characteristics is Realty Income (O -0.29%). It was actually the first dividend-paying stock I ever bought and I've added to my position significantly over the years. In fact Realty Income is the largest single holding in my portfolio and if I were only allowed to buy one stock it would likely be the one I'd choose.

Realty Income in a nutshell

Realty Income is a real estate investment trust or REIT that specializes in freestanding (single-tenant) properties. About 80% of its tenants are retail businesses but it has significant holdings in industrial and agricultural properties as well and it recently entered the market for gambling industry properties.

Now many people are hesitant to get involved in any investments that are related to retail but Realty Income isn't a typical retail stock. About 92% of its rental income comes from tenants that are in businesses that are recession-resistant not susceptible to e-commerce disruption or both. To name a few examples its top tenants include Dollar General (NYSE: DG) Walgreens (NASDAQ: WBA) FedEx (NYSE: FDX) and Walmart (NYSE: WMT). In all Realty Income owned more than 11733 properties as of September 2022 and it has maintained an average occupancy rate of more than 98% since 2000.

Its tenants sign long-term leases that have initial terms of a decade or more and have annual rent increases or escalators built in. And these are triple-net leases which means that the tenants are responsible for taxes insurance and maintenance – virtually all of the variable expenses of property ownership.

All Realty Income needs to do is acquire properties with high-quality tenants in place and enjoy year after year of predictable growing income.

A rare combination of income safety and growth

So now we've established that Realty Income is a relatively safe business that's designed for steady income and growth. The other hurdle that might stand between many investors and a decision to buy it is that they'll assume this is a ""boring"" stock. And to be fair the business itself isn't terribly exciting.

However its track record tells a different story. Realty Income first listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1994. Since then it has never missed a monthly dividend payment and has increased its payouts more than 100 times at an annualized growth rate of 4.4%.

And here's the key point. Thanks to a combination of income growth rising property values and smart capital allocation Realty Income has delivered a 14.4% annualized total return since its public debut. To put this into perspective if you had invested $10000 into Realty Income at the time of its 1994 listing and reinvested your dividends along the way you'd have about $500000 today.

By most standards a 50-bagger in less than three decades isn't a boring investment. In fact Realty Income has produced roughly four times the S&P 500's total return in the same period.

The best all-around dividend stock?

To be sure there are several other stocks in my portfolio that could also be standalone investments. A solid case could be made for Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) and of course a low-cost S&P 500 index fund like the Vanguard 500 Index Fund (VOO 0.57%) is essentially an all-in-one stock portfolio that can deliver strong performance over time.

Having said that I've said before that Realty Income is perhaps the best all-around dividend stock in the market and I truly believe it. It's one of the only stocks that I'd be willing to buy shares of and then not check my investment account for years -- the business is that solid. I've owned Realty Income for years have never sold a share and plan to hold it for decades to come.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVnbG9iZWFuZG1haWwuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy9tYXJrZXRzL3N0b2Nrcy9LTi9wcmVzc3JlbGVhc2VzLzExNDI3OTE5L2tub3dsZXMtdG8taG9zdC1pbnZlc3Rvci11cGRhdGUtY2FsbC1hbm5vdW5jZXMtdXBjb21pbmctY29uZmVyZW5jZS1hdHRlbmRhbmNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Knowles to Host Investor Update Call; Announces Upcoming Conference Attendance,"Knowles Corporation (NYSE: KN) a market leader and global provider of advanced micro-acoustic microphones and balanced armature speakers audio solutions and high performance capacitors and radio frequency (“RF”) products will host an Investor Update call on Tuesday November 29 2022.

Gas prices are already sky high – averaging $3.804 per gallon according to AAA as of November 7 – but they could go even higher now that OPEC+ decided to reduce oil production by 2 million barrels a day in a bid to hike up oil prices amid stalling global economic growth.

Inflation Relief Checks: How To Get Your Payment for November

Stimulus Checks: 63% of Americans Support the Federal Government Sending More Inflation Relief

Amid the strain which is largely driven by the Russia-Ukraine war consumers are hurting. Oil companies however aren’t suffering one bit; in fact they’re seeing major paydays.

Here’s a look at three of the biggest oil corporations and how they’re profiting right now:

Exxon : Grew earnings to $19.7 billion and $24.4 billion in Q3 2022. Shares rose 3% to $110.70 a record high according to Reuters.

Chevron : Grew earnings to $11.2 billion in Q3 2022 compared with $6.1 billion the previous year.

Shell: Grew earnings to $9.45 billion for Q3 2022 compared with $4.13 billion from the same period in 2021.

Why are these oil corporations making so much money?

Huge Profits Are Part Of Oil Companies’ Business Model

“There are a couple of reasons why the oil companies are making a killing” said Irina Tsukerman Esq a geopolitical analyst a member of the American Bar Association’s Oil and Gas Committee and the president of Scarab Rising Inc. “First energy companies are considered a ‘means of production.’ They are free enterprise and like any other commodity in the U.S they are not controlled by the government nor can the government regulate prices.”

“In fact in the event of tax hikes either on the product itself or on the companies the companies can pass off the losses to the consumer as what companies typically do during inflation with any other product. And private companies are structured around making profit for themselves and their shareholders” she continued.

Not only are oil companies entitled to make profits no matter the suffering of the consumers they serve but they’re also somewhat obligated to do so.

“Private enterprises are in fact obligated by their fiduciary responsibility to maximize profits” Tsukerman said. “In fact even ‘socially responsible’ businesses (of which fossil fuels were never considered a type) are actually making profits and benefiting financially in various ways whether through tax write-offs or by attracting a new consumer base.”

Tsukerman added that “unlike public health or other such national emergencies or during a time of war when the government can commandeer any business to redirect themselves to producing a particular product for national benefit such as masks ventilators or military equipment (and which is done very rarely for a business) inflation – often resulting from the government’s own policies – is not a circumstance where the government can pressure or force companies to produce anything much less change prices and its business model. In fact that is considered undue interference and is inappropriate bordering on illegal.”

Story continues

And then there’s the fact of scarcity of supply which Tsukerman says makes a difference “because when demand rises so do the prices because consumers are willing to pay more for the same product.”

Unless Inflation Is Considered A National Emergency High Prices Aren’t Going Anywhere

No matter how bad inflation gets it’s unlikely that oil companies will soften prices.

“Whether and to what extent inflation can be considered a national emergency where companies should be acting in anything but their self-interest is a question for debate but arguably 40 years ago when the inflation was around the same level across the country it still was not considered an emergency and government relief to the public did not come via pressure on energy or other companies to stop benefiting from the rise in prices” Tsukerman said. “The entire U.S market system is built on self-interest.”

Take Our Poll: Do You Believe in Quiet Quitting?

How then will prices lower?

“The best way to lower prices for the consumers is to increase supply so then the prices then fall” Tsukerman said. “And there is less demand which not only leads to a natural fall in prices but the companies actually lower the prices further to attract consumers.”

Last week the 1.2 million-square-foot warehouse at 3021 Commerce Road in Deepwater Industrial Park sold for $127.7 million city records show.

The newly built distribution center landed Lowe’s as a tenant after the home improvement giant balked on a similarly sized distribution facility in Hanover.

The property’s new owner is Realty Income Corp. a publicly traded real estate investment trust out of California.

The seller in the deal was Hourigan Development the local firm that built Deepwater Industrial Park. When Hourigan bought the 110-acre plot for $8.5 million around five years ago 17 old warehouses stood on the site. Those were razed to make way for the new industrial park.

Not included in Realty Income’s purchase were a pair of parcels at 2301 and 3205 Commerce Road that Hourigan continues to own. The two parcels total 35 acres and roughly 300000 square feet of industrial space is being built on them.

City records show the Realty Income deal closed on Nov. 1. The parcel was most recently assessed at $6.2 million.

Hourigan Development founder and CEO Mark Hourigan declined to comment as did a spokesperson for Realty Income Corp.

According to its website Realty Income Corp. has nearly 12000 properties in its portfolio 347 of which are in Virginia. It’s unclear the extent of its holdings in the Richmond region though it does still own a tobacco packaging plant in Chester that it bought in 2015 for $16 million.

At nearly $128 million the sale is the second-largest real estate deal in the city limits so far this year. The top spot is held by the $150 million sale of Gateway Plaza in July.

Evan Magrill a Thalhimer broker with nearly 30 years of experience working on industrial deals said he sees the Realty Income-Hourigan transaction as a sign of the local industrial market’s strength. He said industrial space in the region has around a 2 percent vacancy rate.

“The (industrial) product type has been in favor — more companies are storing more goods and the economy’s been good” said Magrill who did not work on the sale of the Lowe’s building. “We don’t see a let-up in sight. The pace may slow but it’s still a very strong market.”

The Lowe’s building sold for about $106 per-square-foot a rate that Magrill said is also indicative of the times.

“A few years ago ($106 per square foot) would’ve struck me as high. Today it does not strike me as high” he said. “Construction costs are much higher than they have been in the past. They’re expensive to build get leased and ready for tenants. It’s a good value for the seller for sure.”

Magrill said we may also be seeing the effects of rising interest rates on the pace and structure of industrial dealmaking.

“It’s possible this one was rushed because of interest rates moving up. Maybe the buyer wanted to get their financing in place prior to (interest rates) going up” Magrill said.

“There may be some hastened selling right now but it’s also hard to predict what interest rates will do over a longer period of time. We might see people using adjustable-rate financing or doing short-term financing and long-term leverage at a later date. It’s hard to say.”

Hourigan meanwhile has another major project cooking in the Southside.

The Supreme Court will let Amgen argue to resurrect a pair of Repatha patents that were put on ice back in 2019. At the time a Delaware judge sided with Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals after a series of Amgen wins in the long-running PCSK9 feud. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the lower court’s decision in 2021.

A spokesperson for Regeneron said the company expects the Supreme Court to reach a decision by the end of June Reuters reports.

The case stretches back to 2014 the year Amgen leveled its original lawsuit against Sanofi and Regeneron over alleged patent infringement by the partners’ rival PCSK9 cholesterol drug Praluent under development at the time as alirocumab.

Praluent and Repatha won U.S. approval just weeks apart in 2015. Both medications help lower “bad” LDL cholesterol by blocking the protein PCSK9.

Amgen “firmly believes” its scrapped Repatha patents are valid a company spokesperson told Reuters late last week. Patent protection is paramount “not only for Amgen but also for the entire biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry to make the significant investments required to discover and develop new innovative therapeutics"" the spokesperson added.

Amgen has argued that the court ought to back broader protections on antibody drugs like Repatha suggesting that without those intellectual property bulwarks me-too drugs can emerge with minor changes to successful meds without committing the same resources to research. Sanofi and Regeneron have countered that letting Amgen’s Repatha patents stand could allow companies to deflect entire classes of rival drugs by claiming overly broad protections.

Over the years the litigation has captured the attention of many industry watchers and prompted other drugmakers to weigh in. Last year Amgen ginned up the support of several of its big biopharma peers including Biogen Bristol Myers Squibb and Merck & Co. The companies argued in a petition that the precedent set by Amgen’s loss would “slow the pace of research and development and hinder innovation to the detriment of patients and the public at large.”

Amgen launched its bid at the Supreme Court last November. Earlier this year the high court called for the U.S. solicitor general’s opinion on whether it should reconsider Amgen’s loss.

In late September the Biden administration’s top lawyer Elizabeth Prelogar suggested Amgen’s petition “should be denied.”

The fact that the Supreme Court has now decided to hear Amgen’s argument marks a rare turn of events on the patent litigation front. Typically the Supreme Court takes up very few cases on petition and that’s especially true where patent law is concerned Barnes & Thornburg partner Ron Cahill explained in a recent interview.

Cahill made his remarks alongside a prediction the Supreme Court wouldn’t take up Teva Pharmaceuticals’ petition in a separate patent case revolving around the common generic carve-out tactic known as “skinny labeling.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaHVkc29uaW5kZXBlbmRlbnQuY29tL3RhcnJ5dG93bi10cnVzdGVlcy1vbi1iYWxsb3QtcnVubmluZy11bmNvbnRlc3RlZC1vbi1lbGVjdGlvbi1kYXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tarrytown Trustees on Ballot Running Uncontested on Election Day - The Hudson Indy Westchester's Rivertowns News -,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='thehudsonindependent.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /tarrytown-trustees-on-ballot-running-uncontested-on-election-day/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF1B07CA0>, 'Connection to thehudsonindependent.com timed out.

The annual release of Apple’s iPhones usually runs like clockwork a prime example of how the U.S. tech giant has become the most profitable company of the globalization era by seamlessly navigating the world’s two largest economies.

But this year a smooth rollout for the iPhone 14 was the latest casualty of the growing difficulties of doing business in China. Beijing’s no-holds-barred approach to stopping Covid-19 and heightened tensions with the United States have forced Apple to re-examine major aspects of its business.

A recent outbreak of coronavirus cases in the region surrounding Apple’s largest iPhone factory in Zhengzhou in central China prompted local officials to order a seven-day lockdown last week. As a result the company said on Sunday it will not be able to produce enough phones to meet the demands of the holiday season.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2JlYXV0eS9pbnNpZGUtc2VwaG9yYXMtcGxhbnMtZm9yLWdyb3d0aNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inside Sephora's plans for growth,"To receive the Vogue Business newsletter sign up here.

French multinational beauty retailer Sephora is laying down plans for continued growth in a crowded and competitive marketplace with multiple challenges. For starters the LVMH-owned business which has more than 2600 stores across 35 countries is relaunching in the UK this month.

A key focus is a twin expansion of Sephora’s physical stores combined with development of digital sales. Besides the UK accelerated global development in regions such as Latin America and Asia is underway. Sephora positions itself as “beauty’s playground” tapping into consumers’ predilection for small luxuries during a period of global economic uncertainty and is betting that now is the right time to bring that to new markets.



Speaking in London on the eve of Sephora’s UK relaunch Sylvie Moreau Sephora president of Europe & the Middle East who joined the company in the summer of 2021 from Coty laid out future plans. Since pandemic restrictions lifted she says “bricks-and-mortar stores are the biggest winners”. This effect has been especially pronounced in premium beauty. Data from retail monitoring company Placer.ai indicates that in August this year foot traffic in the US was up in the beauty and spa sector by 33.3 per cent on the same period in 2019. Some Sephora stores have seen increases in foot traffic as high as 45.7 per cent compared to the same month in 2020 data estimates suggest.



Foot traffic at competitor retailers such as Ulta Beauty and Space NK is also on the uptick. Space NK’s store revenues are up 15 per cent from before the pandemic. Financial services company Cowen estimates that Ulta has a bigger market share in the US than Sephora — 9 per cent compared with Sephora’s 6 per cent.

Crowded marketplace

In physical retail there’s more overlap than ever before between the brand selection found at premium retailers and drugstores — in the UK Chanel Dior and Givenchy’s beauty lines can be found at both high-end department stores and the pharmacy chain Boots for example. In the US Ulta has added more niche and premium brands such as Bread Beauty Supply and Drunk Elephant while big box retailers such as Target and Walmart continue to attract indie additions such as Starface and Lime Crime. In the UK Boots remains a powerful player commanding a 48 per cent share of the nation’s premium beauty market.

Sephora once stood alone with its appealing offer of indie and premium names and brand agnostic staff. Now it’s a more crowded field with more players jostling for market share. According to Moreau the exuberance of Sephora’s in-store experience including the opportunities for brand discovery can keep it in prime position.

“We see beauty as a celebration and we show up the loudest for that” she says. “In the store you will always hear music and we carry out our services in the middle of the shop floor not away in a little cocoon. We have a very extroverted voice.”

Brand incubator role

On top of the lively in-store atmosphere Moreau says Sephora wants to raise its profile as a significant brand incubator for indie hopefuls. She highlights the example of Huda Beauty which launched with a simple selection of false lashes in Sephora’s Dubai store and has since grown to become a billion-dollar business. Recently appointed executive vice president global chief merchandising officer Artemis Patrick is heading up much of this effort. Moreau says the company wants to find another “10 or so” very small brands and give them a launch platform with Sephora. “We are making big bets on these brands” she says.",,,,,,,,,

Rocha mainly backed by teachers other unions

By Tamara L Seward & Allen D. Payton

In the race for Antioch School Board Area 5 Trustee Mary Rocha leads in fundraising with $19159 in contributions over challenger Dominique King whose reports show a total of $11095.02 raised including loans from herself of $2759. Those figures are according to their Form 460’s as of close of reporting on Oct. 22 and Form 497 late contribution reports as of Nov. 2. King raised most of her funds inside Antioch. While Rocha spent almost twice as much as King during the reporting period the challenger shopped local with most of her expenditures made inside the city.

While individuals and other political committees can contribute a maximum of $4900 political action committees can contribute more. Campaigns must report the details for any amount of $100 more in contributions or expenditures.

Rocha Mainly Backed by Teachers Other Unions

For her re-election campaign Rocha started with $119.74 from her previous run in 2018 which gave her a total of $19278.74 to spend. MRocha ASB 2018 460 0701-092422 MRocha ASB 2022 460 0925-102222 MRocha ASB 2022 497 102622 MRocha ASB 2022 497 110222

Rocha’s latest Form 460 report includes two mistakes showing the $1500 from I.B.E.W. listed three times resulting in an overstatement of her contributions received by $3000. Her grandson Ruben Rocha serves as her treasurer and son Louie is assisting on her campaign. Louie said Ruben corrected the report as of Sunday evening Nov. 6.

In addition the incumbent received $1000 each from LE03-Awin Management Inc. of Phoenix Arizona which is a subsidiary of Republic Services the garbage company that serves Antioch.

Her only reportable individual contributions from outside Antioch totaling $1100 were $1000 from former Antioch Police Chief Allan Cantando of Brentwood and $100 from Deputy D.A. Mary Knox of Walnut Creek.

Rocha’s expenditures which total $11471.91 were mostly spent outside of Antioch. They include $5625 to Mesa Outdoor of Danville for Highway 4 digital billboard ads $4521.92 paid to JB Services of Martinez for mailers and $485.34 to My Legacy Matters Inc. of Vallejo for lawn signs.

She only spent $615 inside Antioch with $500 paid to the Antioch Historical Society for a fundraising event and $115 to the Antioch Herald for advertising.

Rocha’s latest Form 460 report shows an ending cash balance of $4906.83 which was overstated by $3000 and she had an outstanding debt of $1875 owed to Mesa Outdoor. With the additional $5900 in additional contributions reported on two Form 497’s on Oct. 26 and Nov. 2 that leaves her with $5931.82 to spend during the final week of the campaign.

King Mainly Backed by Thorpe Antioch Residents

Now instead of riding the hot wave into their next game the Jets will have some time off as they prepare for the second half of the NFL season. Gang Green’s next game won’t be until Nov. 20 when they play at the Patriots.

The Jets have been one of the biggest surprises in the league this year as they’re 6-3 through the first nine weeks of the season. If the playoffs started today the Green and White would be the fifth seed in the AFC. More importantly the Jets sit just a half-game behind Buffalo for the top spot in the AFC East.

Although the first half of the season has been great the Jets players aren’t looking too far ahead.

Robert Saleh and the Jets have exceeded expectations so far this season.

“We have the next half of the season coming up and we just have to take it one game at a time” Jets left guard Laken Tomlinson said. “We know what’s coming up next.

“We are fortunate enough where we have a week where we can rest up a little bit. But we have to stay focused ice and rest up.”

One of those players who probably wishes he could compete and continue his strong play is Zach Wilson who is coming off one of his best games in a Jets uniform. Against the Bills Wilson completed 18 of 25 passes for 154 yards and a touchdown. He completed 72% of his passes which was a career-high.

Wilson faced a lot of criticism after the Jets 22-17 loss to the Patriots the week prior as he completed 20 of 41 passes for 355 yards two touchdowns and three interceptions. But Wilson blocked out the noise and has led the Jets to a 5-1 record since returning from his preseason meniscus injury.

As the Jets will have the week off Wilson will return home to Utah and visit his family and relax his body before the second half of the season begins. But he does plan on studying film and keeping his mindset prepared for the final eight games.

“We are excited about where we are at” Wilson said. “But we know there’s a lot of work that needs to be done.

“Because of where we are at guys are taking this bye week very seriously as far as where we need to be when we come back and the improvements that we need to make and how we can keep this thing going.”

As the second half of the NFL season is set to begin the Jets have already surpassed their win total (4-13) from last season. They also have shown they’re never out of any game with multiple comeback victories.

The Jets have won three games this year (at Browns at Steelers and vs. Bills) after trailing by double digits. But the Jets defense has a lot to do with that as they’re ranked seventh in opponents yards per game (312.0) and eighth in opponents points per game (19.6).

Jets coach Robert Saleh said he told the players that the bye is not a week off it’s just a week away from the building. He also hopes the players will take care of their bodies and continue to work hard.

“It’s been fun” Saleh said. “Even the most optimistic Jet fan wouldn’t have had us at 6-3.

“But at the same time we have a great opportunity during the second half of the season but that’s going to require a mindset of just resetting every single day and treating every moment like a championship moment and staying true to what we’ve been able to do.

“Attacking this bye week and coming back next week and attacking the week heading up to New England. You gotta keep the main thing the main thing.

“While what’s happened in the past and the first nine games of the season have been awesome and it is fun and it is cool to get all of those affirmations it doesn’t mean anything if we don’t attack the second half in the exact same manner.”

RANKINS WILL BE REEVALUATED

The Jets defense held the Bills offense to only three points in the second half of their 20-17 victory on Sunday. But it came at a bit of a price.

Defensive tackle Sheldon Rankins injured his elbow and will be week to week according to Saleh. The seven-year veteran suffered the injury during the first quarter of the game against the Bills.

ESPN reports that Rankins dislocated his elbow and will be out for four to six weeks. Saleh didn’t specify what Rankins’ injury was or how much time he might miss.

“We are going to allow the bye week to see what happens with him” Saleh said. “In terms of [injured reserve] is concerned we are not even going to look at that until we get back from the bye week to see how he responds to this week.

“We are hopeful he can avoid IR.”

Rankins has been one of the anchors of the Jets defensive line which has vastly improved nine games into the season. He has 25 tackles two sacks and three tackles for loss.

The good news for the Jets is that their defensive line is arguably the team’s strength. Along with Quinnen Williams the team also has Solomon Thomas and Nathan Shepherd who can play in Rankins’ spot. Micheal Clemons also has some experience at defensive tackle and could be used in rotational situations at defensive tackle.

The 6-3 Jets are on a bye this week which could help Rankins return to the field faster. Because of that the Jets may not place Rankins on injured reserve because he would have to miss a minimum of four games.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZW1vY3JhdGFuZGNocm9uaWNsZS5jb20vcGljdHVyZS1nYWxsZXJ5L3Nwb3J0cy9mb290YmFsbC9uZmwvYmlsbHMvMjAyMi8xMS8wNi9waG90b3MtYnVmZmFsby1iaWxscy1uZXcteW9yay1qZXRzLXdlZWstOS84MjgwNzc5MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Photos: Buffalo Bills at New York Jets in Week 9,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.democratandchronicle.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /picture-gallery/sports/football/nfl/bills/2022/11/06/photos-buffalo-bills-new-york-jets-week-9/8280779001/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF25FBA30>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZW1vY3JhdGFuZGNocm9uaWNsZS5jb20vcGljdHVyZS1nYWxsZXJ5L3Nwb3J0cy9mb290YmFsbC9uZmwvYmlsbHMvMjAyMi8xMS8wNi9waG90b3MtYnVmZmFsby1iaWxscy1uZXcteW9yay1qZXRzLXdlZWstOS84MjgwNzc5MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRlYWxtYW5nby5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9tZWV0LWluZGlvLWZhbGNvbmVyLWRvd25leS1ldmVyeXRoaW5nLWFib3V0LXJvYmVydC1kb3duZXktanItcy1zb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meet Indio Falconer Downey: Everything About Robert Downey Jr.'s Son,"Robert Downey Jr. is well-known for playing the role of Tony Stark in several films within the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

At that point a source close to the Downey family told People magazine that Indio has had problems with addiction in the past. The insider told the media outlet “Robert clearly understands the struggle and while of course this relapse was very upsetting to him he is very proud of his son.”

At that time a source told People magazine that after the arrest Indio voluntarily checked himself into rehab. The insider went on to say “Indio truly wants to stay clean. And no matter what his dad will be right there with him.”

Indio Falconer Downey has two younger half-siblings

After getting a divorce from his first wife Deborah Falconer Robert Downey Jr. moved on in his life. He met his second wife then-Susan Levin in the year 2003 on the sets of the film Gothika.

At first Susan wasn’t too sure about Robert as she wasn’t interested in dating the star of one of the movies she was working on. In a 2014 interview she called him ‘interesting but weird.’

But shortly soon the stars aligned for these two lovebirds after Susan agreed to go on a date with Robert and things took off from there. In 2003 Robert proposed to Susan on the night before her thirtieth birthday. The couple got married on August 27 2005 in a Jewish ceremony.

It’s a market area that has the potential to shape and influence our future for the better and investors and entrepreneurs are actively promoting development in this speech. This report powered by Net Zero Insights aims to give an overview of everything that happened in GreenTech across Europe in the past month.

GreenTech refers ​​to the use of tech that has a positive environmental impact at its core. It refers to those companies that are founded for a wider purpose – it could be reducing carbon emissions tackling pollution minimizing waste protecting the world’s ecosystems or anything that contributes to making life on earth more sustainable and less harmful.

From fueling the energy transition and rethinking food supply and consumption to carbon offsetting and sustainable mobility GreenTech players are creating a greener healthier and happier planet. Sustainability investing is a growing trend as well with more investors recognising the importance of thinking sustainable when backing innovation. We took an overview of sustainability investing this month.

And it comes at a pertinent time. At the end of this month the UN shared that there is currently no credible pathway to reaching current climate targets in place. The gap between the CO2 cuts that have been pledged internationally and the cuts that are needed to limit any rise in global temperature to 1.5C the internationally agreed target is rising and progress is said to be ‘woefully inadequate’. It paints a bleak picture and emphasizes even more the need for innovators to be supported.

According to Net Zero Insights on a global level the capital granted to climate tech organizations has reached $59 billion this year. It accounts for 19% of global venture funding in Europe and North America so there’s still a glimmer of hope for climate tech even during the global economic crisis.

Startups and innovation contributing to the energy transition attracted 43% of the total GreenTech investment in Q3 2022 with transport circular economy and food tech ventures following close behind. Further in the Nordics and the UK it looks like climate tech and GreenTech investment continue to be on an upward trend. In total according to Net Zero Insights funding in Europe and North America registered an all-time-high investment in October. After Q2’22 and Q3’22 noticed a decrease in funding September and October start to see signs of growth with European climate tech startups raising about €5.5 billion across 75 rounds. It’s important to note that one company H2 Green Steel alone raised €3.5 billion. Sweden seems to be the country leading the way in GreenTech attracting 84.4% of European funding.

European startups and innovative thinkers are at the forefront of trying to make Europe more climate-friendly and planet-positive uniquely positioned to be agile to think outside of the box and to dare to challenge the status quo. It’s imperative that as a community we continue to support innovation in this space and encourage new ideas to flourish.

Let’s Take a Deeper Look

Green is the new black? Green is the new black?

While October exposed the sad reality that there is still lots to do to put the brakes on the escalating climate crisis we have seen lots of promising developments that we’re excited to see – from both startups and bigger enterprises.

For example the popular fashion brand Zara decided to join the circular economy movement opening up a second-hand marketplace. Wider society has been moving towards a more circular outlook with more and more people understanding the benefits that reusing products have rather than being so wasteful. When major corporations make decisions like this one it’s clear to see that they recognise this swing towards circularity isn’t going anywhere but up and it shows that it’s financially beneficial as well as the logical choice on an ethical and eco-conscious level.

Further competitor Mango quickly followed suit on the green front. Not long after Zara’s announcement the brand Mango shared new investments in eco-friendly fashion startups – notably in Slovenian startup recovo.co which is a young team selling on textile waste to promote more circularity in retail. And it doesn’t end there when it comes to fashion this month as micro-mobility operator Bolt unveiled a new sustainable fashion line. The company is turning old e-scooters into jewellery as part of an upcycling campaign. It shows that circularity is relevant across industries and the sky really is the limit on what can be achieved.

If upcycled e-scooters aren’t to your taste October also saw the launch of a new fashion marketplace Alterist aiming to globally connect emerging designers handmade unique products and purposeful consumers. The aim is to reduce the impact of textile waste on the environment through the proposal of appealing garments to drive a change in the industry.

New Funds and Accelerators New Funds and Accelerators

This month we also saw new GreenTech funds launched- once again reaffirming how investors are realizing the benefits on all levels of investing in going green:

Global investment firm Lightrock just announced the close of its oversubscribed inaugural Climate Impact Fund at an incredible €860 million. The Fund will make initial investments in growth-stage companies across Europe and North America that are fueling innovation in solving the world’s greatest generational challenge – the climate crisis.

Climate tech VC firm Satgana launched a new fund with a targeted close of €30 million to support the next generation of impact entrepreneurs. Already the fund has invested in 3 planet-positive startups.

IMPACT investment fund Shift4good announced that it has raised over 100 million euros (S$139 million) in the first close for its venture capital fund dedicated to supporting startups in the sustainable mobility sector.

One of Europe’s leading early-stage investment funds XAnge  launches a new European-wide Climate Fellowship to encourage more people to build businesses with a positive impact on climate change. All fellows will receive an equity investment of €100000 and extensive support for one year. The program is supported by one of the largest pre-seed investors in the world Techstars  and the global VC firm Energy Impact Partners .

Startups catching our eye

There was a lot of money raised plenty of deals and movement and new launches and acquisitions going on this past month. Here are 5 startups that had a September to remember and caught our attention:

Tallinn-based Sunly loaded €200 million for its renewable energy projects.

London-based Hoxton Farms raised €22.5 million to grow cultivated fat as an ingredient for the meat alternatives industry.

Amsterdam-based Fastned picked €75 million for its fast-charging network for electric vehicles to charge with renewable energy from the sun and wind.

HumanForest hit the headlines this month. London’s sustainable e-bike operators integrated a new style of bike became part of Yonder’s member rewards to further access to sustainable travel around London and launched products on its TreeCoin Market on the app.

Hitting the Headlines

At EU-Startups our aim is to put a spotlight on exciting startups and innovative and inspiring entrepreneurs and thought leaders from across Europe’s startup ecosystem. We think it’s important to shine a light on those making an impact and firmly believe that highlighting innovation sharing ideas and promoting bold ideas that aim to make a change in the world is one way to contribute to a more positive society.

After the release of hot chocolate bombs and iced coffee-flavored jelly beans Dunkin’ is once again teaming up with Frankford Candy for a new treat this holiday season.

Packaged in a box that resembles the one used to hold Dunkin’ Munkchkins doughnut holes the new Dunkin’ Box O’ Chocolates includes 12 individually wrapped doughnut-shaped chocolates loaded with one of three fillings: Boston Kreme Brownie Batter or Chocolate Creme.

The Boston Kreme flavor is made with a milk chocolate shell and chocolate and vanilla cream filling while the Brownie Batter flavor is a milk chocolate shell with a Brownie Batter-flavored cream filling inspired by Dunkin’s Valentine’s Day limited-time doughnut. The Chocolate Creme candy has a white chocolate shell with a milk chocolate cream filling.

You can find them in stores now including Walmart Target Publix Kroger Walgreens CVS Rite Aid and Five Below at a suggested retail price of $6.99. You can also find them on Frankford Candy’s website for $15 for a two-pack.

Frankford Candy

Along with the new sweet treats Dunkin’ Hot Chocolate Bombs are returning for the holiday season and include two new flavors: Dunkaccino and Spicy.

The new Dunkaccino bomb is inspired by the signature Dunkin‘ coffee of the same name and combines the flavors of coffee and hot chocolate-flavored Belgian milk chocolate. The Spicy bomb features a rich Belgian milk chocolate shell with hints of spice. All Dunkin’ Hot Chocolate Bombs which also include milk chocolate and mint flavors include mini marshmallows.

You can find the Dunkin‘ Dunkaccino Hot Chocolate Bomb at H-E-B Rite Aid and Ross stores while the Spicy Hot Chocolate Bomb will be sold at H-E-B Ross and Hy-Vee stores. All varieties are priced at $3.99 each in-store but if you can’t find them in a store near you you can order a 12-pack of each flavor for $55 each from Frankford Candy and use them as stocking stuffers.

Frankford Candy

While you’re shopping on Frankford Candy’s website you can also order a pack of Dunkin’ iced coffee-flavored jelly beans which are also sold on Amazon for $8.50 a bag

The Dunkin’ jelly beans come in Toasted Coconut Hazelnut French Vanilla Caramel Latte and Butter Pecan flavors that are similar to the chain’s menu of iced coffees.

Are you excited to try any of these coffee-inspired treats this holiday season?

If you want to skip our analysis of the retail market you can skip this article and head on to the 5 Largest Retailers in the US in 2022.

The US retail market has continued to grow in recent years and was estimated to occupy a market size of $6.9 trillion in 2022. The country is home to some of the biggest retail stores in the world with companies like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) operating in the country. In 2021 the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions of the US FED spurred growth in sales of all the retail stores in the country as consumers continued to spend freely in a low-interest rate environment. However the outlook for big retailers in 2022 has changed as the FED has continued to raise interest rates amidst high inflation. The high rates are expected to slow down the economy and deteriorate the consumer sentiment in the country as people are likely to focus on increasing their savings in the coming months.

Contrary to the expectations the consumer spending is still very robust. Nearly seventy percent of the US economy is consumer spending and the US GDP registered an annualized 2.6% growth during the third quarter. This is why many retail companies have seen an increase in their sales in the current year. However discount retail stores like Dollar Tree Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) and Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) are positive on their outlook for the coming quarters since they are also experiencing a rise in their store traffic as people started to search for discounted prices.

Even though the consumer price inflation still hovers around 8% the overall retail sales has been growing at double digit rates during third quarter. Amazon.com (AMZN) one of the biggest retailers in the US registered a topline growth rate of 15% during the third quarter however the online retail giant guided for an increase of only 5% for the fourth quarter. So experts and companies are expecting a significant slowdown in retail spending but we have yet to see this in the reported numbers.

Aristotle Capital Management Global Equity which sold out of its Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) stake during Q2 discussed its reasoning for stepping to the sidelines in the fund's Q1 2022 investor letter:

We first invested in Walgreens Boots Alliance in early 2013. Over our holding period Walgreens merged with U.K.-based Boots Alliance establishing itself as a global leading retail pharmacy chain. CEO Stefano Pessina set the company on a path of pursuing strategic partnerships (as opposed to vertical integration deals) to increase store traffic and to over time transform the business into a neighborhood health destination around a more modern pharmacy. Using its strong FREE cash flow generation the company ramped up its investments in technology aiming to accelerate the digitalization of health information. Mr. Pessina was not successful however at turning around the firm's US retail segment and had to deal with increasing prescription drug reimbursement pressures. He stepped down as CEO in 2020 and in 2021 Roz Brewer took the reins of the firm. We admire Ms. Brewer's impressive track record at companies that include Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Walmart (Sam's Club). However given management's decision to divest core cash-generative businesses and redeploy capital to embryonic healthcare startups we prefer to step aside while we follow the company's progress.

Here is what Madison Mid Cap Fund has to say about Ross Stores Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:

Ross Stores is one of our longest-tenured holdings. Its profits have gyrated wildly since the beginning of the pandemic first from store closures and shutdowns then from the pent-up demand for apparel and more recently from the economic uncertainty. Adding to that Ross is finding that consumers' spending trends in terms of mix and categories have been more difficult to predict than usual resulting in some mismatches between its merchandise assortment and what shoppers want. This doesn't appear to be a Ross-specific issue as other apparel retailers have reported similar problems. We attribute this to the unusual post-pandemic environment and while we don't have a crystal ball as to when this will normalize we believe it will.

Here's what LRT Capital Management said about Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:

Executive Summary At LRT Capital Management we are continuously searching the market for great investment opportunities. Our favorite finds are companies with moats and growth opportunities that justify a higher price than what the stock is trading for. One of our holdings (approximately 1.5% of our long exposure) is Dollar General (DG) so today we wanted to tell you a bit about this great company. Company Overview Dollar General is a discount retailer with the largest brick-and-mortar presence in the United States by store count. The company's largest concentration of stores can be found in the southern southwestern midwestern and eastern parts of the United States.10 Dollar General was founded in 1939 by J.L. Turner who originally named the company ""J.L. Turner and Son Wholesale"". As the name suggests the company began its life as a wholesaler but quickly turned to a retailer of general store goods. By the early 1950s the company had annual sales of $2 million per year12 which is the equivalent of $22.95 million in 2021 dollars when adjusted for inflation. The first Dollar General store opened on June 01 1955 in Springfield Kentucky. The simple concept was that no item in the store would cost more than one dollar. The company changed its name to Dollar General Corporation in 1968 when Dollar General became publicly traded. At the time of its initial public offering the business generated more than $40 million in annual sales. The company's common stock was publicly traded from 1968 until July 2007 when it was taken private by KKR. The company went public again in November 2009 under the ticker DG. Today Dollar General is an evolved and phenomenal business with more room for growth. Annual sales reached a record $33.7 billion in fiscal year 2021 after consecutively growing the top line for many years. The company's main products are every-day necessities and consumables purchased by lower income consumers on tight budgets…

7. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT )

Market Cap: $72.67 billion

Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is the 7th largest retailer in the US operating 1938 stores in the country. The company offers a diverse range of products across various categories including beauty food and beverage apparel and accessories and home furnishings and décor. The company has an employee base of over 400 thousand people across 50 states in the United States.

The company has been able to grow its sales significantly during the previous year as it reported revenue of $104.6 billion in 2021 up 13% compared to $92.4 billion in 2020. Earlier in October Target and Apple announced a collaboration under which Target will have more locations for Apple products allowing consumers to buy more of the company's offerings during the holiday season.

Ensemble Capital shared its stance on Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:

Speaking on their earnings call Target's CEO Brian Cornell said that spending on items such as kitchen appliances TVs and outdoor furniture – products that consumers splurged on while stuck at home – has declined sharply. While they had expected there to be a shift from spending on goods to services as America exited pandemic lifestyles they didn't anticipate the speed and magnitude of the shift. On the other hand they saw luggage sales grow by an astounding 50% along with robust growth in ""going out"" categories such as sunscreen beauty products and even toys as families return to hosting large birthday parties for their children. So despite Target seeing increasing foot traffic and higher spending overall they got caught with the wrong inventory relative to what customers wanted to buy. What this means for investors is that it is incorrect to say that the consumer is weak despite weakness in some consumer facing companies. Rather what people are spending money on is changing rapidly which is good or bad for a given company based on what they sell. Importantly with demand shifting from items that were in short supply there is good reason to think that inflation in these categories will moderate. Indeed Target stated that their plan was to put their excess inventory on sale something that consumers haven't seen a lot of over the past two years. But as demand for COVID era goods moderates demand for activities such as travel has surged driving up inflation in airline tickets and hotel rooms. This illustrates the way that the shock waves from the pandemic have scrambled the typical economic cycle such that even at a time when all signs point to the biggest summer travel season in history investors are worried that we are headed into or are already in a recession.

6. The TJX Companies Inc. (NYSE:TJX )

Market Cap: $82.14 billion

The TJX Companies Inc. (NYSE:TJX) is a major off-price retailer of clothing home goods and other items operating 4689 stores worldwide.

However the sales have started to normalize in the current year and the company's net sales declined by 2% YoY in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.

The ClearBridge Investments Large Cap Value Strategy liked the potential post-pandemic customer surge to The TJX Companies Inc. (NYSE:TJX) as revealed in the fund's Q4 2021 investor letter:

The pandemic created opportunities for us to be more aggressive in a variety of areas of the market. We were opportunistic throughout the year for example in positioning the portfolio to benefit from a flush consumer eager to return to spending and traveling. New positions included TJX an off-brand retailer with a large presence in the US and Europe that should continue to benefit from the contraction of many traditional retailers particularly as consumer spending resumes.

“With more motorists holding onto their vehicles longer an expanded product offering is required to keep those older vehicles on the road” said Jason Yurchak Worldpac senior vice president Canadian operations.

“Bringing our Worldpac parts inventory together with Carquest under one roof allows us to carry parts for virtually every type of vehicle on the road today. Our DC team offers nightly replenishment of every Worldpac and Carquest facility with multiple same day deliveries ensuring customers get the right part at the right time.”

The cost of flying has surged nearly 43% over the past year. Even basic hotels and resorts are charging eye-popping rates for rooms this fall with average prices in some markets up more than 20%.

But there's one type of trip where you can still find a relative deal: a cruise.

Much to the frustration of cruise line executives the world's biggest cruise brands haven't been able to raise prices over the past year nearly as much as hotels resorts and airlines as the travel industry rebounds from COVID-19 lockdowns.

That's made what has long been a notable differential between the cost of land vacations and the cost of cruise vacations even wider than it was before — so wide that it's verging on the ridiculous some say.

""We've seen this 40% gap to land-based vacation [this year]. It used to be about 20%"" Royal Caribbean Group CEO Jason Liberty lamented Thursday in a conference call with Wall Street analysts. ""We're not happy about that gap.""

Royal Caribbean Group is the parent company of Royal Caribbean Celebrity Cruises and Silversea Cruises.

Liberty's estimate of a 40% differential in pricing isn't hyperbole. Several Wall Street analysts that track pricing at travel brands in recent months have pegged the current difference between the cost of land and cruise vacations when comparing like-for-like products at around 30% to 50% — higher than they have ever seen.

In a recent analysis travel insurance comparison site insuremytrip.com pegged the differential at around 30% noting that real-time data it had on what customers were paying showed the average land trip costing $6426 — $1469 more than the average cruise.

Travel insurance companies have unusual insight into what people are paying for trips as their customers must declare the amount they are paying to contract for insurance.

The differential in pricing is particularly wide when comparing the big mass-market cruise lines such as Royal Caribbean and Carnival Cruise Line to comparable land-based hotels and resorts.

ROYAL CARIBBEAN

In a research note in late September Truist lodging and leisure analyst Patrick Scholes said his firm's proprietary data analysis showed that cruise fares at the six biggest cruise brands were down in the ""low single digits"" as compared to pricing levels in 2019 the last normal year before the pandemic.

Room rates at U.S. land-based resorts by contrast were up more than 25% from pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels he said.

""We have not yet seen an acceleration of [cruise] prices rather the degree of deceleration in pricing for new bookings over the past month has stabilized from the downward trajectory seen earlier in the year"" Scholes noted at the time.

Scholes called cruises the best value in the vacation world right now.

""Room rates at land-based resorts are at record prices and so far the cruise lines have missed out on most of this leisure strength"" Scholes wrote. ""Given this record pricing [at land-based resorts] and service levels that are arguably substandard for the rates one is paying we see the best value in vacationing at the moment coming from cruising. Cruise prices especially for the Caribbean are at record lows whereas service levels are at their typical high levels.""

Analysts say the differential in pricing is partly the result of the long shutdown of the cruise industry during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many cruise lines canceled cruises by the hundreds every few months during the pandemic eventually remaining shut down for more than a year.

That in turn made many cruisers skittish about booking future trips on cruise ships lest those trips eventually be canceled too.

The result of such hesitation was that cruise lines started 2022 with their ships less booked than normal and they've had to keep prices relatively low to get them filled. That wasn't the case for hotels and airlines which saw occupancies bounce back much more quickly in 2022.

The situation is exacerbated by the fact that cruise ships normally book up much further in advance than other types of travel. That means that a blip in bookings at any given time will affect occupancy levels on ships many months if not a year or more in the future.

Occupancy levels on cruise ships have been increasing throughout the year but they still are running lower than normal.

In October the world's largest cruise company Carnival Corporation noted that occupancy levels at its nine brands averaged just 84% during the peak summer travel months of June July and August — below the 87% that Wall Street analysts had been expecting and well below normal levels.

Carnival Corporation which owns its namesake Carnival Cruise Line brand as well as Princess Cruises Holland America and Costa Cruises usually reports ship occupancies during the summer months over 100% — something possible when more than two people stay in a cabin.

Passenger ticket revenue for the summer months at Carnival Corporation also came in well below Wall Street expectations a sign the company was struggling to maintain pricing.

Royal Caribbean Group on Thursday also reported lower than normal occupancy for its most recent quarter and projected occupancies would remain below normal levels through the early part of 2023.

However Liberty the Royal Caribbean CEO was optimistic when talking with Wall Street analysts on Thursday that occupancies on the company's ships would return to normal by the spring or summer — and said he was confident the company could get its pricing up too.

""We see there's a lot of opportunity to close that gap [between land resort and cruise pricing] here over time"" he said during the call with Wall Street analysts. ""We need to improve our loyalty programs. We need to be more one-to-one [with marketing] so that we're putting offers in front of our guests that are very relevant to them individually and [we need to] just bring more awareness [to the pricing differential] and that should all yield us closing the gap further to land-based vacation.""

Translation: Don't expect the super-low cruise pricing to last for too much longer.

According to the port the agreement outlines the parties’ intention to develop a project timeline and specifications as well as cost estimates and proposed agreements for a system to deliver shore power to vessels docked at the port.

Rodger Rees Galveston Wharves port director and CEO said: “As a Green Marine-certified port we recognize shore power as an opportunity to improve air quality and reduce greenhouse gases associated with maritime activities.

“This project working group is our dream team. It’s a winning combination with energy infrastructure expertise from Shell and CenterPoint Energy the experience of major cruise lines Royal Caribbean and Carnival and the educational and research resources of Texas A&M-Galveston.”

Royal Caribbean Group is outfitting its new Galveston cruise terminal for when shore power becomes available for the Allure of the Seas. The ship will homeport at the new cruise terminal opening Nov. 9.

“We are in lock-step with Galveston Wharves’ vision for sustainable cruising” said Jason Liberty president and CEO of Royal Caribbean Group. “Our Galveston cruise terminal is built with sustainability top-of-mind and will operate using 100-percent renewable onsite energy. This step toward shore power at the Port of Galveston extends our efforts and our collective goal of a clean energy future.”

Carnival Cruise Line also has pledged that any of its ships regularly assigned to homeport at Galveston will be capable of connecting to shore power once it is made available.

The new Carnival Jubilee scheduled to homeport in Galveston in 2023 will be equipped with shore power capabilities. The ship will run on clean-burning liquified natural gas (LNG) making it the first cruise ship homeporting at Galveston to have this energy technology.

Christine Duffy president Carnival Cruise Line said: “As we prepare to bring the magnificent Carnival Jubilee to Galveston next year we could not think of a better time to work with the Galveston Wharves and our other partners to bring shore power closer to reality. We are fully committed to a successful shore power program as it is in line with our top priorities of compliance and environmental protection as well as the health safety and well-being of our guests employees and the people in the communities we touch and serve.”

Glenn Wright senior vice president of Renewables & Energy Solutions Shell Energy said: “The world is working toward a more sustainable energy future in many areas and Shell is proud to be a leader in delivering integrated decarbonization solutions to help achieve those objectives. Integrating shore power into port infrastructure is a perfect example of this and we’re excited to work with such a diverse and dedicated group to support the Galveston Wharves as it builds upon its existing sustainability program.”

The Galveston Campus of Texas A&M University is conducting a study of shore power for cargo ships to help determine possibilities for the port to provide that service.

“Driving discovery is key to supporting the blue economy for the Gulf Coast region and beyond” said Col. Michael E. Fossum vice president of Texas A&M chief operating officer of the Galveston Campus and superintendent for the Texas A&M Maritime Academy. “Partnering with the Port of Galveston which is our campus’ backyard and an employer of our graduates aligns perfectly with our mission to educate innovate and create real industry solutions to advance our economy.”"

During a recent stand-up show a comedian roasted an audience member who reported working for the Biden administration.

""What a s--- show of a job you have!"" comedian Josh Ocean Thomas said in response.

Thomas a San Diego native who moved to the Midwest to pursue comedy shared a clip of the exchange during his recent set at The Laugh Factory in Chicago on Instagram earlier this week where it has gone viral.

""You work for the Biden administration? Is your job to wake him up or what’s your job?"" Ocean asked ""Nick"" as the audience erupted into laughter.

BIDEN VOWS TO WITHHOLD WEAPONS FROM ISRAEL IF NETANYAHU GOES FORWARD WITH RAFAH INVASION

Miming a fictional Biden staffer trying to get the president’s attention he exclaimed ""Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! There’s a war! Hey!""

The bit continued with Thomas asking Nick what he really does for Biden. Before he could respond the comic remarked ""What a s--- show of a job you have. I can’t believe you admitted that in front of all these people.""

""You have the freedom to lie. You could have said you were a hooker and I would’ve been prouder of you"" he added.

The alleged Biden staffer started to tell Thomas that he travels to southern states before the comic interrupted with a burst of laughter.

""That’s crazy! You go to the south and try to sell ‘em on Biden? You’re f----- r------! What the f---? What are you talking about?"" he said. ""That’s your f----- job? Is to go ‘Hey listen I know you guys like Trump but Biden. I mean…’""

BIDEN WARNS NETANYAHU AGAINST RAFAH INVASION AS ISRAEL PREPARES FOR ACTION

The clip ended with one last joke as Thomas asked ""Wow. Are you ready to be unemployed? Or what’s your vibe?""

Thomas captioned the video writing ""This was my only option.""

Thomas wasn't the only comic to take aim at Biden this week.

Anti-Trump comedian Michael Rapaport torched the president in a video he shared to X on Thursday in which he officially declared he would not be supporting Biden’s re-election after the world leader told CNN he would not send weapons to Israel if it invades Rafah Hamas' last stronghold in Gaza.

""Smoking Joe Biden. Cadaver Joe Biden. I never thought I would say this. I'm not voting for you. You're not getting my vote"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL3Jmay1qcnMtdnAtcGljay1uaWNvbGUtc2hhbmFoYW4tdHJpZXMtdG8tc2hha2Utb2ZmLWRhaWx5LWJlYXN0LXN0b3J50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,RFK Jr.'s VP Pick Nicole Shanahan Says She's 'Hurt' by Daily Beast Story,"Nicole Shanahan who ignored repeated requests for comment on a Daily Beast story about her astonishing ascent to become Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s running mate complained on Thursday that she was “slandered” and had to “take a walk to shake it off.”

Shanahan who has been bankrolling RFK Jr.’s spoiler-ready campaign for president with the fortune she got in her divorce from Google founder Sergey Brin did not raise any specific objection to the story which she said she didn’t read until nearly a full day after it was published.

But she did go into detail about an almost cinematic encounter she had on her walk when she “pulled into a farmers market to say hello to the farmers.”

“I walked by a young man on the empty side of the parking lot who recognized me and said ‘Nicole Shanahan!’ and said he was a supporter of Bobby and watched my speech” she wrote on X.

“He said he studied the psychology of politics in college. I told him about the article and how I was trying to walk it off. He told me he had watched the ‘Who is Bobby Kennedy’ film which is specifically about how cruel and embarrassingly desperate the left-wing media can be.”

“He’s 23 years old. I looked up at the sky and then said to this young man ‘thank you you are just what I needed in this moment to keep going strong.’ His name is Alex. Thank you Alex.”

The Daily Beast reached out to the Kennedy campaign after her post but did not get an immediate response. The Daily Beast could not reach Alex because no last name was provided but he can contact us at tips@thedailybeast.com at any time.

The story that Shanahan appeared to be referring to detailed her meteoric rise from a turbulent childhood in Oakland California to the wife—and then ex-wife—of one of the richest men in the country as well as the running mate of a conspiracy theory-driven third-party presidential candidate who could hand the election to Donald Trump.

The Beast story the result of more than a dozen interviews and several weeks of work was highlighted by top tech journalist Kara Swisher on Threads on Thursday. In particular Swisher noted that a source who has spent significant time with Shanahan scoffed at Kennedy’s description of her as an artificial intelligence expert with the source saying that she “couldn’t differentiate ‘AI from a tennis ball.’”

Swisher then went on to add “And more: Unsuccessful entrepreneur losing lawyer bloviating nonsense on all manner of things she has no expertise in marriage incompetence and she’s just plainly a candidate for a thirsty wack job because she managed to get a pile of money from a tech billionaire who wanted her to go away.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvdXMvcG9saXRpY3MvcmZrLWpyLWphY2stc2NobG9zc2JlcmcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Using Cartoonish Accents J.F.K.'s Grandson Insults and Mocks Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,"The grandson of President John F. Kennedy this week savaged his presidential-candidate cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in a series of mocking meant-to-be-funny videos that were inarguably uncharacteristically un-Kennedyesque escalating a civil war within America’s most storied political dynasty.

In a series of Instagram posts the grandson Jack Schlossberg 31 variously called Mr. Kennedy 70 a “prick” suggested he was using steroids said he was “lying to us” and portrayed him as a Russian stooge and a stalking horse for Donald J. Trump.

But what viewers may be more struck by or even insulted by are the heavily accented caricatures the young scion used to dramatize his points.

Mass firings have happened at Twitter Stripe Salesforce Lyft Spotify Peloton Netflix Robinhood Instacart Udacity Booking.com Zillow Loom Beyond Meat and several others.

What caused the funding crunch and resulting layoffs?

Crunchbase explained “The public markets have been hit hard in 2022 and that’s trickled down to the private markets. Inflation concerns rising interest rates and geopolitical issues have all contributed to a roller-coaster stock market. Start-ups — especially those that benefited from a pandemic boom that’s starting to cool — are feeling the pressure too. Valuations particularly at the late stage have started to dip and start-ups say it’s much more difficult to raise new funding in this environment.”

Even though several Indian start-ups especially in edtech have had to resort to mass layoffs this year Mumbai-based Dream Sports Group currently valued at $8 billion continues to be profitable with a cumulative user base of over 150 million across its group companies. These include Dream11 Rario FanCode DreamPay DreamSetGo and more.

Dream11 launched on the Google Play Store on October 9 after Google allowed the official listing of real-money gaming apps. By November 2 it climbed to the top of the gaming charts on the Play Store.

Jain added in his post “We have 10 kickass portfolio companies in Fantasy Sports NFTs Sports OTT FinTech Sports Experiences etc that are constantly looking for great talent especially with leadership experience in Design Product & Tech. If you or someone you know fits the above feel free to reach out to us.""

He also shared an email id (indiareturns@dreamsports.group) for laid off Indian techies in the US to reach out to."

In an increasingly competitive economic development landscape the City of Sugar Land is making a big play to keep the companies it already has.

Earlier this month Sugar Land officials announced a new incentive program aimed specifically at the city’s office headquarters companies. The approved program provides $6000 per job for qualified businesses to keep their headquarters in Sugar Land. As new office parks and commercial real estate developments pop up across the region and in competitor markets Sugar Land’s move is a business retention tool designed to keep companies and investment inside the city limits.

“Retaining office headquarters is key to maintaining high-paying jobs in Sugar Land” said Elizabeth Huff Economic Development Director for the City of Sugar Land. “Our new incentive program ensures we maintain our office headquarter locations during this highly competitive office market and hopefully grow those high-quality job opportunities in our community.”

To qualify for the new incentive program companies headquartered in Sugar Land must retain at least 50 primary jobs and renew their existing lease for five to ten years within the city limits. The program also requires companies commit a minimum of $1 million towards capital investment for build outs or office improvements. The investment requirement is expected to help Sugar Land which consistently ranks among the fastest-growing suburbs in the state to enhance its office infrastructure by encouraging companies to spend money to improve their existing space.

Sugar Land Mayor Joe R. Zimmerman said the new incentive program will enable the city to retain the companies that already call the Fort Bend County community home. “The new program allows us to target existing companies and selected industries in order to demonstrate our level of commitment and partnership to our business community” Zimmerman said.

According to the Houston Business Journal Sugar Land is currently home to the headquarters or principal offices of 19 companies across different industries including a subsidiary of SLB (formerly Schlumberger) Noble Corp. Accredo Packaging and Bluebonnet Nutrition.

Bye-bye baby bump.

Michelle Williams stepped out for her first red carpet appearance since welcoming her third baby (and second with husband Thomas Kail) earlier this fall dressed in an elegant off-the-shoulder black satin gown by Celine.

Williams hit the Los Angeles premiere of “Fabelmans” in the glamorous look which she completed with a Tiffany & Co. Schlumberger necklace dotted with diamonds.

The “Dawson’s Creek” alum wore her blond hair in a sleek center-parted bob and kept her makeup simple with a nude lip and subtle blush.

The movie’s director Steven Spielberg and Williams’ co-stars Seth Rogen and Paul Dano also walked the red carpet at the premiere.

Williams 42 is already a mom to daughter Matilda 17 whose father is late actor Heath Ledger. The Golden Globe winner and her third husband Broadway director Kail also share son Hart 2.

The “Dawson’s Creek” alum was spotted with her third baby in October. TheImageDirect.com

Earlier this month the “Blue Valentine” actress was spotted holding her infant while on a family walk.

Williams and Kail met in 2018 on the set of “Fosse/Verdon” and got engaged the next year before marrying in 2020. Williams was previously married to musician Phil Elverum from 2018 to 2019 following a secret wedding. Kail meanwhile split from Angela Christian in 2019 after 10 years together.

China National Petroleum Corp the country's largest oil and gas producer and supplier has signed 30 purchase agreements with a total contract worth $16.7 billion (120.6 billion yuan) during the fifth China International Import Expo (CIIE) the company said on Saturday.

It has signed contracts with 30 cooperative partners from across the globe including Saudi Aramco Kuwait Petroleum Corporation and Schlumberger it said.

This is the fifth year the company participated in the CIIE with an accumulated purchase amount reaching up to $92.79 billion with 142 suppliers it said.

The company currently sees its annual domestic oil output above 100 million tons with steady growth and an annual domestic natural gas output exceeding 100 million tons of oil equivalent. Overseas oil and gas equity production equivalent has also exceeded 100 million tons it said.

The last time we saw the actress on the red carpet was on September 10 for the Toronto Film Festival premiere where she was heavily pregnant.

Exactly two months later after welcoming her baby with husband Thomas Kail Michelle was back to work promoting this film wearing a black satin Celine by Hedi Slimane strapless draped dress with a smocking bow.

I adore the silhouette the new glossy hairstyle and how Michelle styled this look with the Tiffany & Co. Schlumberger® hands necklace.

But I did find myself somewhat bothered by how the satin material fared between the bust and the hips.

It’s not a crease issue. It looks like there might have been too much material which is why it doesn’t lay flush.

Aside from that small issue this was a wonderful return to the red carpet for the actress.

(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. is planning to begin layoffs that will affect thousands of workers from this week Wall Street Journal reported citing people with knowledge of the matter.

The job cuts could come as early as Wednesday the newspaper said. The company has already told employees to cancel non-essential travel from this week according to the report.

Meta shares rose 3.8% to $94.20 as trading got underway in New York on Monday. The stock has declined about 73% for the year through Friday.

Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg in September outlined plans to reorganize teams and reduce headcount for the first time following a sharp slowdown in growth at the parent of Facebook and Instagram. Zuckerberg said then that Meta will likely be smaller in 2023 than it was this year.

The layoffs come as Meta struggles with growing losses and as it invests heavily in developing its metaverse business.

“Meta may seek at least $3 billion to $4 billion in opex reductions through layoffs and fixed-cost cuts to bring its view closer to the lower end of its expense guidance of $96 billion to $101 billion” Bloomberg Intelligence Analyst Mandeep Singh wrote in a note on Monday.

The cuts will add to already mounting job losses in Silicon Valley. Twitter Inc. last week slashed nearly 3700 positions after Elon Musk completed his $44 billion takeover of the social media platform. Other companies that have also reduced their workforce or announced plans to include ridehailing firm Lyft Inc. and hard drive maker Seagate Technology Holdings Plc.

A spokesman for Meta declined to comment to the WSJ.

Even if you're already using a cloud storage service like iCloud to back up all of your data a ""hard copy"" back up keeps you further protected should any data breach occur. And for the most part physical disk space works out cheaper in the long run given the monthly subscription fees required to keep large capacity cloud services running. Here are a few options to get you started on your search for the best USB-C hard drive for your best Mac.

The best USB-C hard drives for Mac

You can always trust iMore. Our team of Apple experts have years of experience testing all kinds of tech and gadgets so you can be sure our recommendations and criticisms are accurate and helpful. Find out more about how we test.

What if you have an older hard drive with a USB-A plug?

You may already have a perfectly good hard drive except that it has a USB-A plug. We have a list of the best USB-C hubs for you so you can use it with your newer model Mac. The current MacBook Pro lineup has added back HDMI and SDXC slots to certain models in addition to Thunderbolt/USB-C ports but no USB-A ports. That's OK because USB-C is fast and future-proof.

Our USB-C hard drive recommendation for your Mac

External hard drives are must-have peripherals for anyone with a computer. If you back up your Mac in multiple places then your data is far safer and you're prepared for anything. They give you additional storage space which can quickly fill up laptops and are essential to backing up your data safely and securely. All of the USB-C hard drives for Mac on this list are easy to set up and start using right away. All you have to do is plug one into your Mac. If you're getting an external hard drive make sure it can connect to your Mac.

If you're buying a USB-C hard drive for your Mac the LaCie Rugged is our staff's favorite portable hard drive because it's affordable and reliable. It's Mac-ready but can also be used with Windows computers. If 1TB isn't enough there are also 2TB 4TB and 5TB versions available. The LaCie Rugged of yesteryear got former iMore Editor-in-Chief Lory through her entire post-secondary education and now that there's a USB-C option it'll help get you (and maybe even your children!) through school or work with reliability and that fast connection.

On the other hand if you want something super portable lightweight with an enormous storage capacity the ZZBBKKZZ 16TB External Hard Drive is an excellent pick. Its sleek design can easily fit in the palm of your hand or slide in your pocket purse or backpack.

“I always had an interest in the logic of solving complex problems and in working out how these problems could be solved more effectively by using technology” said Richard Guy co-founder and services director at customer workflow company Konversational.

It was this interest in solving problems that led Guy to study engineering work in various tech companies get an MBA and eventually cross paths with his co-founder John Gilleran.

At the time of meeting Gilleran was running Focus Group Europe a reseller for ServiceNow in the UK that he founded in 2009. In less than eight years the company accumulated more than 200 clients and 75 staff before being acquired by Accenture.

The two then used their tech industry and ServiceNow experience in Ireland and the UK to launch Konversational in 2020.

“Konversational is the leading ServiceNow technology consultancy firm in Ireland” Gilleran who is the Dublin-based start-up’s managing director told SiliconRepublic.com.

“We support organisations on their customer digital transformation strategy help them to extend their services beyond the customer contact centre and scale operations by automating work across multiple departments.”

The story so far

ServiceNow is a global cloud computing platform that helps companies manage their digital workflows. Gilleran said that Konversational is “at the forefront” of delivering and implementing ServiceNow customer workflow products in Ireland and the UK.

Typical brands and markets that Konversational targets are those that have a “traditionally high percentage of spend on managing customer service” because of the opportunity for value creation by tapping into technology.

“We have a diverse set of enterprise customers spanning finance retail manufacturing healthcare and technology sectors across the UK and Ireland. Whilst we sell across many different verticals we have a specific focus on the technology service providers marketplace” Gilleran said.

As a sales and services partner as well as authorised training partner of Service Now Konversational is on a mission to be recognised as the “go-to” partner for customers looking to improve their digital transformation programmes in Ireland and the UK.

“Throughout the previous decade we saw enormous expansion of customers adopting SaaS and transforming how they interact with their employees through the application of ITIL [Information Technology Infrastructure Library] and service management disciplines to drive automation and improvements in experience” said Guy.

“As we moved into a new decade we saw an opportunity to take this approach and technology to work with those customers where there is typically a lot of complexity in how they manage their customer interactions.”

Today Konversational is one of the fastest-growing ServiceNow partners in the EMEA region according to Guy and is on track to becoming an elite customer workflow partner.

As with many other tech players Konversational got a big boost during the pandemic when companies adapted to a new online reality by shifting focus to digitising operations.

“It is this shift in focus that is still driving a lot of our new client conversations today particularly so in sectors like finance retail and tech” Gilleran said of Konversational’s client base which includes Dublin-headquartered IT firm Ergo.

Attracting talent

Every growing start-up needs a strong team behind it. Konversational is particularly keen on attracting both highly skilled graduates starting out their careers as well as experienced professionals who want to “embrace the challenge” of growing a company.

“At Konversational we really value diversity in the context of experiences and outlook. Having worked in multiple countries across the globe we are firmly of the view that teams which have a good gender and ethnicity balance have the foundations in place for success” Gilleran said.

This is one of the reasons Gilleran and Guy chose to base Konversational’s headquarters in Dublin where key talent is readily available.

But finding the right people to work for the company and upskilling employees at pace has also been “the biggest challenge so far” in the start-up’s growth journey Guy explained.

“One of the biggest lessons from my career so far is that age and experience are not necessarily a pre-requisite to success” he added.

“Rather it is finding exceptional talent helping to shape and grow careers and by doing this it allows a start-up to scale at their own pace rather than relying solely on having to hiring experienced resources.”

Having bootstrapped the business so far with a strategy of “continually reinvesting any profit to maximise growth” Guy said the team has no plans of attracting any external investment as of now.

“But as we continue to grow we will always be open to considering strategic changes which will add value both to Konversational and more importantly add value to our customers.”

CREF

Brandon Eckenrode managing director of CREF announced Rod Habel director of training for Sherwin-Williams received a Fueling the Future Award which recognizes an individual or company that has gone above and beyond helping the collision repair school program students and instructors.

“He has always been there for schools and students across the country” said Eckenrode.

Two instructors shared what Habel’s support has meant to them and their programs. Jay Abitz from Freedom High School in Wisconsin said the generous donations from Habel and Sherwin-Williams have really changed the trajectory of their program.

Kenny McMillian from Kennedy King College in Illinois also shared his sentiment. “I would like to express my special thanks and gratitude to Rod Habel and all he has done for our program at Kennedy King College over the years as well as everyone at Sherwin-Williams who embraced our collision program” he said.

Greco Publishing

Mike Anderson from Collision Advice received Greco’s Publishing’s Industry Icon Award. “Our inaugural industry icon award winner is known locally regionally nationally and globally as the ‘go to’ in collision repair” said Alicia Figurelli Greco’s Publishing’s senior vice president.

“My dad passed away in May and this is a memory of him” said Anderson. “He helped me understand what quality was and customer service and I’m grateful for that.” He added he was truly humbled and grateful for the award.

I-CAR

I-CAR’s awards were announced by John Van Alstyne CEO and president. Bill Condron at Sawgrass Ford received the Jeff Silver Memorial Award named after the industry leader who was considered the pioneer of I-CAR Gold Class and Platinum recognition programs.

“Just as Jeff showed the difference one person can make our award recipient believes there is something he can do about the pervasive talent shortage” said Van Alstyne. “He’s made it a personal mission to recruit new talent in the industry he loves. Just as important he takes the time to nurture the newcomers and support the continuing professional development of everyone he works with.”

Eveland Bros. Collision Repair Inc. a family-owned and operated operation received the Russ Verona Memorial Award.

“Our award-winning collision repair center invests heavily in the education of its staff who hold I-CAR Platinum credentials and are certified by ASE and dozens of OEMs” said Van Alstyne. The business has adhered to I-CAR’s Gold Class standard continuously since 1993 making it one of a very small group of shops in the country to reach this milestone.

NABC

Rather than handing out awards NABC President and CEO Bill Garoutte gave accolades to those in attendance and those who weren’t. “Our mission and vision are to make the collision industry the best it can be and put on its best face for the communities where we live and work” said Garoutte.

SCRS

During the last presentation of the morning Danny Gredinberg administrator of the Database Enhancement Gateway (DEG) received the 2022 March Taylor Kina’ole Award. It was presented by Aaron Schulenburg executive director of SCRS; Barry Dorn vice president of Dorn’s Body & Paint; Toby Chess; and Dale Matsumoto president of Auto Body Hawaii.

“This is a very special meaningful award for all of us” said Schulenburg.

When March passed away Schulenburg said it was important this his legacy of Kina’ole---doing the right thing at the right time for the right reasons---was honored acknowledged and rewarded. It also became a mantra for SCRS and many others.

“True Kina’ole really happens naturally. It has a deeper meaning” said Matsumoto. “It doesn’t happen in your head. It happens here… in your heart.”

Chess the 2021 recipient of the March Taylor Kina’ole Award said March was a great mentor and stood for what Kina’ole is. March regularly arrived at his shop at 5 a.m. to communicate with the information providers on times that were not right in the database.

“When he got up to 200 of them he said ‘I can’t do this anymore. They are coming in faster than I can handle’” recalled Chess. That was the birth of the DEG.

When announcing the award recipient Dorn said Gredinberg is tireless with the DEG just like March getting up early and staying up late to do the right thing for those who don’t have a voice. “[Danny] has shown us time and time again that he cares and he cares selflessly about what goes on and he embodies what Kina’ole is.”

“I love giving back because there was a time when I needed help and I was reaching out to resources that were available through the DEG” said Gredinberg. “I’m very fortunate to be part of a great industry that has given me so much.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcm5pbmdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS8yMDIyLzExLzA3L2dlbmVyYWwtcGx1Zy1sY2NjLXBpbG90LWVhcm4tYW5kLWxlYXJuLXByb2dyYW0tZm9yLXN3aXNzLWNuYy1tYWNoaW5pbmcv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubW9ybmluZ2pvdXJuYWwuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvMDcvZ2VuZXJhbC1wbHVnLWxjY2MtcGlsb3QtZWFybi1hbmQtbGVhcm4tcHJvZ3JhbS1mb3Itc3dpc3MtY25jLW1hY2hpbmluZy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,General Plug LCCC pilot Earn and Learn program for Swiss CNC machining,"General Plug & Manufacturing is partnering with Lorain County Community College to preempt an expected shortage of machinists in the coming decades.

Flanigan president and CEO of General Plug & Manufacturing. “Both internal employees who want to elevate their abilities and people who can look forward to a new career in Swiss machining industry.”

The U.S. Department of Labor projects about 44100 openings for machinists and tool and die makers each year on average over the next decade.

With this wave of openings forthcoming General Plug & Manufacturing leadership sees an opportunity to introduce a new machining workforce to the Swiss CNC machine.

Flanigan said the Swiss CNC machine which is a segmented machine that can produce extremely small parts quickly and accurately along with other CNC computer numerical controlled equipment has helped a new type of manufacturing emerge.

And along with it comes a new required skillset.

The Swiss CNC machining Earn and Learn pilot will begin early 2023 with a cohort of 10 students most being General Plug & Manufacturing employees.

Jim Tyree general manager at General Plug & Manufacturing said the company is heavily invested in Swiss CNC machining and that partnering with LCCC will provide the detailed ground-level teaching techniques required to help students master these complex machines.

“LCCC is a golden gem in the community” Tyree said. “I think a lot more companies could leverage the college especially in manufacturing training.”

LCCC has built Earn and Learn components into several of its manufacturing pathways because of the benefit to both students and employers.

General Plug & Manufacturing and LCCC plan to expand the program after the pilot concludes.

“The college is known for being out in the community listening to industry needs and coming up with innovative ways to help meet those needs” said Chrissy Cooney program developer for Business Growth Services at LCCC. “These Earn and Learn programs help draw in potential students by not just easing the burden of paying for college but showing them a trajectory for a career and giving them an opportunity to earn an income along the way.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vbmVvLXRyYW5zLmJsb2cvMjAyMi8xMS8wNy9tZWRpY2FsLW11dHVhbC1ocS1zdGFmZi13b250LXJldHVybi1kb3dudG93bi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Medical Mutual HQ staff won't return downtown,"Medical Mutual’s 10-story 120-year-old Rose Building in downtown Cleveland has been mostly empty since the pandemic as many of the insurance company’s employees are working from home. They will not return to work in this building in 2023 and will instead report to work at the company’s operations center in suburban Brooklyn on a hybrid work basis (Google).

HQ leaving for Brooklyn; Rose Building may go residential

A spokesperson for health insurance industry giant Medical Mutual confirmed that the company’s headquarters will leave downtown Cleveland in 2023. However most of their roughly 1000 downtown office employees never returned from remote-working during the pandemic leaving the historic Rose Building at East 9th Street and Prospect Avenue mostly empty over the past two-plus years. Today’s news has led to some wondering if the building could be converted to residential as with other old office buildings downtown.

“Like many other companies we now have the majority of our staff on a hybrid schedule or working from home” said Sue Walton manager of corporate communications at Medical Mutual in an e-mail to NEOtrans. “We have very few full-time employees currently working in the Rose Building. As a mutual company we have to weigh the economic feasibility of maintaining multiple underutilized sites in Northeast Ohio with the responsibility we have toward our members who are a top priority.”

She said employees will begin moving to its Brooklyn offices in a phased approach throughout the year beginning in January 2023. In 2017 Medical Mutual acquired the 381000-square-foot Rose Building for $37.9 million where its corporate office had been located since 1947. That same year it also consolidated several suburban offices into the former American Greetings headquarters in Brooklyn. The latter involved leasing a newly renovated four-story 324000-square-foot office building which is part of an adjoining 1-million-square-foot multitenant commercial structure that was also renovated. Medical Mutual is the oldest and largest health insurance company based in Cleveland.

City officials said they were caught off guard by Medical Mutual’s decision having learned about the announced move only today. The insurance company was prepared to make $12 million worth of renovations to the Rose Building in 2020 but then the pandemic hit. That renovation was to be supported by a $1 million 20-year loan from the city that was deferred for 10 years when some or all of the loan may be forgiven based on the job creation within the city.

Front entrance to Medical Mutual’s operations center in the Cleveland suburb of Brooklyn which is where the company’s staff who aren’t working from home will be based. This building was the former corporate headquarters of American Greetings before the gift card maker moved out to Westlake (jljiinc.com).

“I’m very disappointed in this decision by Medical Mutual and I hope they reconsider” said Ward 3 Councilman Kerry McCormack whose ward includes downtown in a text to NEOtrans. “The city of Cleveland has been nothing but a great partner to Medical Mutual even passing incentives for their downtown building a few years ago. The city is also a large customer of Medical Mutual through our insurance plan. It’s hard to take the statement seriously about the company ‘remaining committed to Cleveland’ when they abandon the city. Cutting a check to philanthropy doesn’t cut it. I wish they would have followed the example of companies like Sherwin Williams and remain committed to Cleveland.”

According to industry insiders the 120-year-old Rose Building no longer served the company’s needs especially in the post-pandemic era. The building has outdated air filtration systems narrow corridors and traditional closed office spaces which made it difficult for office sharing in a hybrid work environment. Also starting next year Medical Mutual employees working early in the day or late into the evening would have been competing for spaces in a 540-space parking deck that will be shared by the new 23-story City Club Apartments 776 Euclid Ave.

Construction of the 304-unit apartment tower could be afforded because a new parking deck didn’t need to be built for it. Instead City Club Apartments residents would use the existing parking deck at night while workers at neighboring companies like Medical Mutual would continue to use it during the day. But not all Medical Mutual employees arrive or leave the office before City Club residents’ cars will out of the parking deck. And many City Club residents will also work downtown including in their own apartments while keeping a car all day at the parking garage.

In addition to Medical Mutual’s offices in downtown Cleveland the company has nine other locations in northern Ohio all of which in suburban offices. McCormack said he intends to make the case to Medical Mutual that leaving downtown may hurt the company’s ability to recruit young talent who want to work in a walkable urban setting. That he said is reason enough for it to retain a significant presence downtown.

The Rose Building was Ohio’s largest office building when it opened in 1902 in a part of Cleveland that was not yet considered the city’s central business district. Indeed a stone townhouse stands next to the Rose Building’s wrought-iron façade on its East 9th Street side then called Erie Street (Wiki).

“Not only is it the right thing to do it’s critical for competitive recruitment for their company” he said. “Decisions like this also increase sprawl and contribute to the regional problem of connecting workers to work places.”

Over the past decade 7 million square feet of leasable office space has been removed from downtown’s inventory by conversions of obsolete office buildings to other uses primarily residential. McCormack said it was too soon to consider alternatives to retaining Medical Mutual’s offices downtown. Walton also said it was too soon to consider how the Rose Building might be used in the future or who might own it.

“We are exploring all options for the Rose Building” she said.

The structure was Ohio’s largest office building when it was built in 1902 by businessman and philanthropist Benjamin Rose. It was built so far out from the city’s central business district at that time that it was called Rose’s Folly. The 10-story building was designed by George Horatio Smith who also contributed to the design of The Arcade linking Euclid and Superior avenues and the Colonial Arcade now the Fifth Street Arcades between Euclid and Prospect avenues.

Company Asked To Walk From Lease Waiting on Bankruptcy Court Judge In Texas

By Tina Traster

The curtain may drop soon permanently. Regal Cinema at the Shops at Nanuet may close its doors early next year.

The closures come on the heels of Cineworld Group PLC Regal’s parent company filing for bankruptcy in the Southern District of Texas in Houston earlier this year. United States Bankruptcy Judge Marvin Isgur may give permission to Cineworld to reject 20 existing leases including the Nanuet Stadium 12 at The Shops at Nanuet. Under the proposed court order Regal can shutter the theater as soon as January 15th and turn over the keys to Simon Property Group.

In the Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization the movie chain asked the court to allow it to terminate leases on theaters it deemed unprofitable. The court order would permit Cineworld to exit its leases on the 20 properties with no further obligation to the landlords.

Simon Property Group always has the option to renegotiate the lease terms and try to keep the theater open.

The court also would permit the company to abandon all the property at each location leaving the landlord with the obligation to either re-lease or gut the property at the landlord’s expense.

The closure of the Regal Cinema would mark the second loss of a movie theater: the Bow-Tie Theater in New City also recently closed.

The list of proposed rejected leases includes Regal Cinemas in Turnersville NJ Hyannis MA and on West 42 Street in New York City’s Time Square known as the E-Walk Stadium 13. The balance of the theaters area spread around the nation.

Headquartered in the UK the publicly traded company is the second-largest cinema chain operating under five major brands in more than 750 locations in ten countries.

As of the initial bankruptcy filing the theater chain represented that its businesses have been severely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic including a decline in cinema attendance and a rise in online streaming.

The chain which has hundreds of leases for nearly 10000 screens had taken critical steps since COVID to ease its financial burden caused by underperforming theaters many of which are subject to off-market lease terms that no longer reflect the value of real estate in the economy.

Over the past two and a half years according to Cineworld the company has attempted “extensive good-faith and arm’s-length negotiations with their landlords reached agreement on various lease restructurings that provided among other things the deferral of rent in some cases.”

While such actions have provided breathing room the industry has not been able to rebound from the pandemic and the relief on some leases did not deliver a long-term solution to the company’s financial problems according to the bankruptcy filings.

In recent months the Shops at Nanuet has shown positive signs of emerging from the pandemic.

Even before the coronavirus pandemic The Shops were flailing losing major chain tenants at a fast clip. High-end corporate names left the center leaving an unprecedented number of empty stores among them Starbucks. By the end of the pandemic the outdoor mall along Route 59 looked ghostly and anemic. But a recent burst of new tenancies appears to be breathing new life into the mall – with a mix of new tenants including Fidelity Investments independent business owners like Saba Rugs & Flooring and a raft of new food and beverage operators including Roast’d Coffee.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN0aW5zaWRlci5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYXJ0aWNsZS9NYWxscy1DVC1EYW5idXJ5LVN0YW1mb3JkLU5vcndhbGstcmV0YWlsLTE3NTQ2MzY1LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Some CT malls going through resurgence others face uncertain future,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.ctinsider.com/business/article/Malls-CT-Danbury-Stamford-Norwalk-retail-17546365.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN0aW5zaWRlci5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYXJ0aWNsZS9NYWxscy1DVC1EYW5idXJ5LVN0YW1mb3JkLU5vcndhbGstcmV0YWlsLTE3NTQ2MzY1LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmci5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL3RyYW5zcG9ydC9hbi1haXJibmItb2YtZWxlY3RyaWMtdmVoaWNsZS1jaGFyZ2luZy1zdGF0aW9ucy1hdC1ob21lLTIwMjIxMTAzLXA1YnY5Z9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Electric vehicles: An Airbnb style company enables people to rent out EV charging stations,"A company that enables people with parking spaces or home garages with an electric vehicle charging station to rent it out to other EV owners for a fee says it has 600 people on its books already after just a few weeks of operation.

In mobile hit “Marvel Snap” it’s a similarly dominating maneuver — a declaration of absolute certainty in your impending victory — but on a much smaller scale. When to do it though? That’s the question.

When you snap in “Marvel Snap” you wager your own rank on the idea that you’ve got a game in the bag. You can do it at any time. If you snap and win your rank gains four points — represented by cubes — toward leveling up. If you snap and lose you lose four. If both you and your opponent snap one of you stands to gain eight while the other loses an equal number. It’s high-stakes stuff just like wiping out half of all life in the universe.

In order of advisability from greatest to least here are some recommendations on the best times to snap in a game.

It’s the final turn and you’re dominating all three spaces

This one basically goes without saying. Your opponent might have one final trick up their sleeve but they’re going to need to spread themselves thin to retake two of the three spaces you’re occupying and the strongest cards often cost all six of the energy points they have to move. Often a snap at this point will get your opponent to retreat instead of playing to the end. The writing’s on the wall; you just have to show it to them.

The only downside here is that if your opponent retreats you get fewer cubes. In this case snapping is more of a formality. Complete domination just feels good whether you get eight cubes or two.

In basically every game for the first 25 ranks or so

“Marvel Snap” matches players pretty generously early on both against training bots and other humans. You’ll likely win the vast majority of your first games so you may as well snap to move up the ladder faster. If you drop a game here or there you can just make up for it with victories on the next few.

When you draw an above-average hand

Due to the randomness of “Marvel Snap’s” spaces and the card-stealing abilities of some decks victory is never certain. But if you pull basically every linchpin card in your deck’s central strategy you’re more likely to win than not so you may as well snap.

Earlier is better in these cases; opponents are less likely to retreat if they believe there’s still time to turn things around. For example I play an Ongoing deck (meaning my strategy revolves around cards with Ongoing abilities) and when I get Klaw who boosts an adjacent space by six power points and Onslaught who can double that ability (while adding a hefty power value of his own) I can reliably take two spaces — even if only by a thin margin. I get a little nervous every time I do it but I snap because statistics are on my side. This method earns way more ranking cubes in the long run.

When your opponent gets off to a wonky start

“Marvel Snap” delights in making fools of even the most meticulous planners. I cannot count the number of times I’ve ended up in a game where say one space decreases my cards’ power to below zero another forces me to play a pitifully weak card while my opponent gets to play their heaviest hitter on turn two and a third mixes a bunch of nonsense — either random cards or rocks — into my hand. Usually by the third turn or so you can tell when a clown car of unlikely events has completely thrown your opponent off their game. Snap early in these cases. Momentum is very much on your side.

Bonus tip: If you’re on the receiving end of unlucky cards and spaces think about retreating. Better to lose one cube and move on than to waste time and lose more.

When you’re honestly not sure who’s going to take the win

Share this article Share

Now we’re getting into the territory of what makes snapping fun albeit not always advisable: mind games. Maybe you’re on turn three or four and you don’t have an ideal hand yet but you want your opponent to think you’ve already assembled your personal squad of Avengers. Or maybe it’s the final turn of a close game and you realize defeat is likely — but your opponent hasn’t snapped. This could suggest that they’re also worried and a display of unearned confidence might be enough to frighten them into a retreat. You chance losing more than you gain in these cases but when you pull it off you are fully allowed — and in fact encouraged — to let out an evil cackle. That’s got to count for something.

When your opponent snaps and you feel a sudden tinge of anger

I mean how dare they think they’re better than you? They probably also live in a big house and drive a nice car. You can’t just let some elite have the satisfaction. This is a principled snap a snap for the little guy. It rarely works out but it’s absolutely what The Incredible Hulk would do and that guy’s a superhero.

On the first turn of every game without fail heedless of circumstance",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvcGF1bHRhc3NpLzIwMjIvMTEvMDcvaXZlLXBsYXllZC0zMC1ob3Vycy1vZi1tYXJ2ZWwtc25hcC1pbi1vbmUtd2Vlay1oZXJlcy13aHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I've Played 30 Hours Of 'Marvel Snap' In One Week Here's Why,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2022/11/07/ive-played-30-hours-of-marvel-snap-in-one-week-heres-why/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvcGF1bHRhc3NpLzIwMjIvMTEvMDcvaXZlLXBsYXllZC0zMC1ob3Vycy1vZi1tYXJ2ZWwtc25hcC1pbi1vbmUtd2Vlay1oZXJlcy13aHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHlnb24uY29tL2d1aWRlcy8yMzQ0NTA0OS9tYXJ2ZWwtc25hcC1iZXN0LXBvb2wtMi1kZWNrcy1raWxsbW9uZ2VyLXNoYW5nLWNoaS12dWx0dXJlLWp1YmlsZWXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marvel Snap’s best Pool 2 decks,"So you’ve made it through Pool 1 of Marvel Snap and found your way into the murky waters of Pool 2. Some of your decks are getting destroyed while others are adding missing pieces. Which are still worth playing? I’m here to help.

Pool 2 is unlocked at Collection Level 222 lasting through Collection Level 474 (after which you start collecting Pool 3 cards). There are a lot of great cards in Pool 2 from direct counters to popular Pool 1 decks (Killmonger and Shang-Chi) to cards that unlock new play possibilities (Vulture and Jubilee).

I’ve previously gone over the best Pool 1 decks in Marvel Snap. Here are the best Pool 2 decks in Marvel Snap including some improved versions of prior decks and some brand new mechanics for you to toy around with.

Dino Control

Key cards: Devil Dinosaur Moon Girl Shang-Chi

Depending on when you picked them up in Pool 1 Devil Dinosaur and Moon Girl may have been a combination you’ve relied on for quite some time. But there are some key additions in Pool 2 worth considering.

Related We must get nerdier about Marvel Snap

Agent 13 is a decent one-drop since she’ll add a card to your hand (increasing Dino’s eventual power). The Collector’s another potential addition since you’ll likely have a good amount of cards in your Dino deck that add cards from outside your deck which will buff The Collector. But the two I went for are Killlmonger and Shang-Chi for an extra level of Control.

Killmonger is the best counter to Kazoo decks in the game. By eliminating all one-costs you can thwart a Kazoo player’s plans (and if you wait until turn six like I like to it’s a real tilter).

Shang-Chi who destroys all enemy cards with nine or greater power at the location he is played at when revealed is the best Devil Dino counter in the game. It’s worth holding one in your own Devil Dino deck because of how often you’ll come across other Dino players in Pool 2. It’s also useful against other powerful four- and five-drop cards like Namor and Warpath.

How do you play around the likelihood your opponent is holding a Shang-Chi as well? You can wait to play your Dino until turn six decreasing the chances Shang-Chi can destroy your big power card or you can play the Armor card and put the Devil Dino in that spot. This is also why I do not have a six-energy card in this deck.

My other cards in this deck are a mixture of cards that will get me more cards cards that will get me info on my opponent and cards that can help me win non-Dino lanes. This is the deck that was by far the most successful for me in Pool 2.

Movement

Key cards: Multiple Man Vulture Heimdall

In Pool 1 you got some of the pieces for a movement deck. You probably tried it out at some point thinking “Hey this synergy seems neat” and lost a lot of games.

Good news! In Pool 2 you get the tools you need to actually make this deck work. Cloak Vision and Vulture can significantly improve your movement deck (as well as Miles Morales for the Season Pass holders).

The idea with this deck is to buff up Multiple Man or Vulture (or both) as many times as possible by moving them around (ideally to a place where Kraven is) or with Forge and Hulk Buster. Vulture gains five power every time he moves while Multiple Man creates a duplicate of himself (including any bonus stats) whenever he is moved. Iron Fist Cloak Doctor Strange and Heimdall all provide avenues for you to move your cards and you’ve got a nice balance here of “cards that move other cards” and “cards that want to be moved.”

One note of caution for Movement players and Movement opponents alike: Because Heimdal moves all of the player’s cards one location to the left Movement decks end up favoring the two leftmost locations. Do with that information what you will.

Discard

Key cards: Morbius Lady Sif Apocalypse

The discard deck relies on buffing up Apocalypse by discarding him as many times as possible. Pool 2 adds a few extra tools to help you win your non-Apocalypse lanes with Morbius and Swarm as two standout cards.

Morbius gains two power every time you discard a card. It’s a straightforward synergy with the rest of the deck and one that encourages you to discard as many times as possible. Swarm is another card that wants to be discarded — when you discard Swarm you get two zero-cost copies of the card.

Another variant on this deck throws in the destroy mechanic (more on that in a second) with cards like Nova Bucky Barnes Carnage and Deathlok. Feel free to experiment with both until you find the one you like.

Destroy

Key cards: Nova Carnage Deathlok Shang-Chi

This deck becomes a lot better once you get to Pool 3 and can add cards like Death but the Pool 2 version of it is a fun anti-meta variant that allows you to mess with your opponents and have a fun time doing it.

The crucial Pool 2 additions here are Bucky Barnes (who turns into the six-power Winter Soldier when destroyed) Killmonger Shang-Chi Hobgoblin and Sabretooth. Hobgoblin is one of the most irritating cards to play against in the game — he has negative-eight power and on reveal moves to the other side of the board. I’ve added Professor X for a bit of location lockdown but the general idea is pretty straightforward: You want to destroy your cheap cards with Carnage or Deathlok and destroy their important cards with Killmonger or Shang-Chi.

Kazoo

Key cards: Ebony Maw Ant-Man Armor Ka-Zar

The “Kazoo” decks a loving nickname for decks based around Ka-Zar and the one-cost cards he buffs are the most consistent in Pool 1. With the addition of Killmonger opponents have more counterplay options against Kazoo decks but they are still powerful.

Ebony Maw is a great one-cost addition to this deck. As a seven-power one-cost card he’s very powerful but prevents you from playing any more cards at that location. Don’t panic — if you draw well you can simply play him last in that location and not worry about it. Keep in mind you can not play Ebony Maw after turn three however.

Another crucial addition here is Armor. Armor is not a necessary card in Pool 1 Kazoo decks. But with the abundance of Killmonger cards in Pool 2 it is absolutely crucial to have one in your Kazoo deck at this point.

There is also another Kazoo variant built around the four-cost Sandman which slows the pace of the game in later turns by only allowing each player to play one card per turn. The idea is you start the game with a flurry of cheap cards and then slow it down before your opponent can respond. I have not had much success with this version but you should feel free to give it a shot.

Jubilee

Key cards: Domino Jubilee all the six-costs your heart desires

This one’s a little more out there and difficult to execute but it is fun and gets a whole lot more fun in Pool 3 (so you can get some practice in now). Jubilee is one of the more exciting cards in Pool 2 playing a random card from your deck at this location. If you stack your deck right that means you can play a powerful card for free.

I have Sunspot in here because there is a decent chance you might have to skip some turns with the unbalanced energy curve of this deck but you could also go with Quicksilver instead for a more straightforward approach (and a guaranteed one-drop). The ideal play pattern: Sunspot on turn one Domino on turn two Storm on turn three if there’s a bad location (or pass) and then Jubilee on turn four. If that’s how the game starts you are in great shape: Jubilee will play another powerful card alongside her for free and then you only have powerful cards remaining.

If you don’t draw Jubilee in time … well you’re kind of out of luck. But if things go your way you can beat just about any deck.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9mb29kLXN0YW1wcy1zY2hlZHVsZS1vaGlvLWRpcmVjdGlvbi0xMTMwMjA1NzUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Food Stamps Schedule: Ohio Direction Card SNAP Payments for October 2022,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9mb29kLXN0YW1wcy1zY2hlZHVsZS1vaGlvLWRpcmVjdGlvbi0xMTMwMjA1NzUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF00156F0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9mb29kLXN0YW1wcy1zY2hlZHVsZS1vaGlvLWRpcmVjdGlvbi0xMTMwMjA1NzUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vMTA2N3dqankuY29tL2x1Y2FzZmlsbS1yZWxlYXNlcy1iZWhpbmQtdGhlLXNjZW5lcy1zbmFwLW9mLWFtYW5kbGEtc3RlbmJlcmctaW4tc3Rhci13YXJzLXNlcmllcy10aGUtYWNvbHl0ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lucasfilm releases behind-the-scenes snap of Amandla Stenberg in 'Star Wars' series 'The Acolyte' – WJJY 106.7,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vMTA2N3dqankuY29tL2x1Y2FzZmlsbS1yZWxlYXNlcy1iZWhpbmQtdGhlLXNjZW5lcy1zbmFwLW9mLWFtYW5kbGEtc3RlbmJlcmctaW4tc3Rhci13YXJzLXNlcmllcy10aGUtYWNvbHl0ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF00173D0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vMTA2N3dqankuY29tL2x1Y2FzZmlsbS1yZWxlYXNlcy1iZWhpbmQtdGhlLXNjZW5lcy1zbmFwLW9mLWFtYW5kbGEtc3RlbmJlcmctaW4tc3Rhci13YXJzLXNlcmllcy10aGUtYWNvbHl0ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Mon 11/07/2022 - 02:25pm | By: Dena Temple

Dr. Heather Annulis left and accounting major Alexander Gray.

Alexander Gray an accounting major in The University of Southern Mississippi’s School of Leadership / Gulf Park campus recently completed an internship with Hy Stor Energy that provided an exciting real-world opportunity.

Hy Stor Energy is an innovative company addressing the challenge facing today’s energy industry – long-duration storage of renewable energy at scale to provide reliable alternative energy. By operating large-scale green hydrogen hubs Hy Stor Energy is creating a model for producing storing and delivering 100% carbon-free energy to help transition to non-fossil fuels.

Gray who served his internship over the summer applied for the position at his professor’s urging through Handshake a website which gives students direct access to employers eager to recruit them. “I was eager to return to the workforce” said Alexander.

He continued “My job responsibilities were rather open; this let me gain as much experience as possible. My favorite part of working for Hy Stor Energy was representing the company at different conventions. It is exciting to meet people and share the company’s goals.”

JT Blalock vice-president of finance and accounting at Hy Stor Energy said the company’s recruiting team contacted USM’s Career Services at the direction of Dr. Jason McKenna director of research at USM’s Center for Ocean Enterprise.

“Alexander assisted our accounting and purchasing teams in daily operations represented the company at industry and community events and performed industry research and summarized his findings for other team members.” Said Blalock. “His attention to detail and willingness to help others made him a valuable asset to our team.”

Blalock said that Alexander performed so well during his internship that he was offered a permanent part-time position while he completes his degree at Southern Miss. In fact Blalock said “I expect offers of full-time employment once he completes his education.”

Alexander’s takeaways from the internship are significant. “I learned more about the energy industry than I ever imagined and I discovered that flexibility both from the employee and the employer remains a core aspect of working” he said. “Hy Stor Energy was amazing about accommodating my school schedule when they hired me on as a part-time employee. I appreciate that.”

Dr. Heather Annulis Director of the School of Leadership noted “We are proud of Alexander for representing Southern Miss during his internship at Hy Stor Energy. We encourage our students to build competencies which make them workforce-ready in our ever-changing dynamic economy.”

Alexander recommends that all students at Southern Miss reach out to Career Services when looking for internships or employment.

“They have a lot of resources and they can connect both students and employers” he said. “Career Services works harder than most students think and they can point a student in the right direction.”

Local employers can also avail themselves of this service if they have open positions. Blalock also noted that “Our experience with USM Career Services and Southern Miss students ensures that we will continue to seek internship opportunities with USM.”

To skip our analysis of the recent market trends you can go directly to see the 5 Largest Renewable Energy Companies by Market Cap.

Electricity is one of the major sources of energy especially for residential consumers. It plays an important role in the daily lives of individuals all across the world from powering daily use electrical appliances to heating and cooling depending on the weather conditions. According to the World Energy Outlook 2022 published by the International Energy Agency electricity accounts for nearly 20% of the world’s final consumption of energy.

According to the World Energy Review 2022 report by Eni solar and wind share increased by 1 percentage point y-o-y to 10% of total power generation in 2021. Global installed solar power capacity reached 855 GW while global wind power capacity reached 823 GW by the end of the year.

The demand for electricity is expected to increase further with the shift toward electric vehicles and global population among other factors. Based on the Announced Pledges Scenario presented by the IEA which considers the pledges made by governments and corporations across major nations the global electricity demand is expected to reach 53810 TWh by 2030 with global supply reaching 61268 TWh over the same period. If all the concerned parties fulfill their pledges renewable energy will account for 80% share of the global supply.

We have picked the top 15 companies based on their market capitalization that are involved in the propagation of renewable energy resources. Some of the companies in this list such as LONGi Green Energy Technology Enphase Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) are involved in the development of renewable energy technologies such as inverters silicon wafers and battery solutions. On the other hand existing energy and utilities companies such as The Southern Company (NYSE:SO) and Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) that are involved in renewable energy generation are also part of this list. More interestingly though fossil fuel giants such as BP Plc (NYSE:BP) also invest heavily in renewable energy and found a place in our list of the largest renewable energy companies in the world.

As a military sociologist and Military.com's transition master coach the one piece of advice I give when it comes to finding the top employers for veterans spouses and military in transition is to look for companies with a military door. The military door is one of the 10 mind-blowing things top employers do.

When it comes to military hiring I know that past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior. During transition you can get hired faster by looking for a job with companies that have a consistent record for hiring veterans and feature what we call ""a military door. ""

What Is a Military Door?

A military door is any prominently featured indicator on the company website that this company recognizes military members are transitioning into a new field and thus do not have the kind of network civilian workers have. It is a sign of the company's willingness to accept your military service in lieu of a referral.

The indicator could be a formal veteran hiring program a picture of a veteran and/or spouse employee a military translator an email address for a dedicated veteran recruiting team or a story about how the company is participating with one of our brilliant veterans service organizations or veteran hiring programs like Hiring Our Heroes or SkillBridge.

How Do You Find the Top Veteran Employers?

To help you find these employers quickly I put together this list of our 25 Top Veteran Employers for 2022. Each one has a military door and a track record for hiring veterans and/or spouses that is a mile long. We have awarded each of them our Military.com Top Veteran Employer logo so that may help you spot these employers quickly.

It would be impossible to rank them against each other since there are so many factors at play. So this year the employers are listed in order of which has the highest percentage of veteran or spouse employees.

Although veterans make up only 6% of the American workforce according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics each of these companies have a workforce of 10%-47% veterans. (FYI in case you were wondering at Military.com 55% of our employees are veterans or spouses -- exactly what you would expect from a military-centric business like ours.).

We truly appreciate what these companies do for veterans and spouses who are looking for work. I've linked each to its veteran hiring page.

Here Are Our 25 Top Veteran Employers for 2022

Finding a top veteran employer with a military door is not a free pass to a job. You still have to do the work of writing a checklist resume applying to the right kind of job at the right level interviewing like a champ networking and negotiating. We teach each of those subjects for FREE in our Veteran Employment Project Master Class Video Library.

The Nov. 6 flight included a musical send-off for departing passengers from California country singer-songwriter Victoria Bailey as well as customized cookies commemorating the occasion.

“We gave Southwest passengers on yesterday’s first nonstop flight from Long Beach to Nashville a big sendoff in celebration of this convenient new route between two great destinations” Airport Director Cynthia Guidry said in a statement.

The flights to Nashville will depart seven mornings per week at 9 a.m. utilizing the airline’s Boeing 737 fleet.

On weekdays after a 45-minute stop passengers can continue on to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington Virginia a primary airport for Washington D.C. The flight arrives in Arlington after six and a half hours without a plane transfer.

“Beyond Nashville this new service adds flexibility and options for travelers to connect to the East Coast and Southwest’s broader network” Guidry said.

The Dallas-based airline first began service in Long Beach in 2016 and has continued to increase its presence at the airport since then.

Including Nashville Southwest Airlines now flies nonstop to 15 U.S. cities from Long Beach Airport.

Of the 53 daily flight slots available at Long Beach’s airport Southwest currently holds a majority with a total of 38 daily flights.

Southwest Airlines first announced its new route to Nashville in June as part of a broader Southwest schedule expansion that also includes flights between San Jose and Palm Springs Nashville and Steamboat Springs Colorado and San Diego and Colorado Springs Colorado.

The latest flight slot was one of two recently relinquished by Delta—the other was awarded to the city’s newest carrier Breeze Airways.

Long Beach Airport currently offers nonstop service to 17 destinations across the nation including Hawaii.

“We’re grateful to the City of Long Beach for additional access at the airport that will bring travelers much more than just nonstop travel to and from Nashville” said Adam Decaire vice president of network planning in a statement when Southwest Airlines first announced service in June. “Nashville service also brings dozens of cities in the East within faster reach and the fastest trip between Long Beach and the heart of the nation’s capital region with through-service to Reagan National Airport.”

When the calendar turns to November many people are already thinking far beyond Thanksgiving and all the way to the winter holiday season. And they're certainly not alone. Starbucks for example celebrates with a seasonal menu that runs from the beginning of November all the way into the new year. Not only that but shops are also fully stocked with unique holiday merchandise that is perfect for gift-giving.

Furthermore since they arrived on the scene in 1997 Starbucks' iconic red cups have become nearly as synonymous with the season as Mariah Carey's ""All I Want for Christmas is You."" This year the cup designs feature four different patterns in white red and green like something right out of your favorite wrapping paper aisle.

All wrapped up in those cups you'll find six festive drinks that return as fan favorites: Peppermint Mocha Sugar Cookie Almondmilk Latte Irish Cream Cold Brew Caramel Brulée Latte Chestnut Praline Latte and Toasted White Chocolate Mocha. The holiday menu also includes several sweets sure to help you find and keep your holiday spirit including a Chocolate Pistachio Swirl Reindeer Cake Pop Snowman Cookie Sugar Plum Cheese Danish and Cranberry Bliss Bar.

Starbucks is the largest coffee chain in the world. According to Zippia the company earned a whopping $29 billion in gross annual sales in 2021 so it's no surprise that it's a household name.

There are a number of unique rules that Starbucks workers have to follow — and several of them have to do with everyday appearance. Starbucks employees are allowed to change their hairstyle but it must be a permanent change — meaning you can dye your hair but you can't style it with temporary hair glitter. Also you've likely never seen a Starbucks employee with multiple facial piercings. That's because according to Insider although a 2019 dress code change allowed for septum piercings employees are limited to one ""no larger than the size of a dime."" Other forms of jewelry are banned as well such as bracelets and rings. The company has pretty strict rules about clothing too; baristas are even limited to specific colors."

They were seized in a joint investigation in August with the St. Louis County Police Department and DEA.

ST. LOUIS – The Drug Enforcement Administration St. Louis Division broke its fentanyl seizure record in fiscal year 2022 with more than 671 pounds of the deadly opioid seized through Missouri Kansas and southern Illinois. That’s a 41% increase over the 396 pounds seized in the last fiscal year and more fentanyl seized than the last two years combined.

Among the seizures was a record 20000 fake pills seized in partnership with St. Louis County Police Department and the first colored fake pills DEA has seized. The latter were seized in Kansas. The colored fentanyl has been also seized in powder form throughout the division.

The increase of 41% in fentanyl seizures aligns with the continued increase since the synthetic opioid was first seized by the division in 2017:

FY 2022 – 671 pounds

FY 2021 – 396 pounds

FY 2020 – 180 pounds

FY 2019 – 227 pounds

FY 2018 – 77 pounds

“Looking at this staggering increase in seizures there is no question that DEA and its local state and federal partners have stepped up our efforts to stop fentanyl from reaching our communities” said Special Agent in Charge Michael A. Davis. “Unfortunately the drugs pouring into the Midwest in multiple forms is also a sign that drug trafficking organizations will go to any length to profit from the misery of our citizens. We’ll continue to take down these criminal networks and put out the message that what they’re selling kills.”

In addition agents and task force officers seized 3203 pounds of methamphetamine and 57 pounds of heroin. Investigators also seized 503 weapons.

Topping off the St. Louis Division’s statistics for 2022 were its efforts to curtail money laundering by drug trafficking organizations seizing and stopping $13.7 million from reaching criminal organization leaders.

Fentanyl a synthetic opioid is used for pain management in a medical setting and is 50 times more potent than heroin. Drug cartels have been attempting to distribute illicit fentanyl in record amounts leading to an alarming increase in deaths caused by illicit drugs.

(Osvaldo Fuentes/U.S. Army)

MASON CITY Iowa (Tribune News Service) -- Final inspections are complete. Their gear is packed. The Army National Guard's 1133rd Transportation Company is shipping out.

Soldiers weighed and packed their gear Thursday and received final pieces of advice from commanding officers. Members of the community were there as well to give them handmade keychains as reminders of home.

Approximately 160 troops from the 1133rd Transportation Company headquartered in Mason City will deploy to Poland in support of ""Operation European Assure Deter and Reinforce."" The unit is expected to be gone for about a year.

The mission is part of the United States' commitment to the international order and the security of our NATO allies. The 1133rd will transport equipment and supplies in support of U.S. and NATO forces.

The 1133rd leaves today for its mobilization station at Fort Hood Texas to complete final training and readiness checks before deploying overseas.

In late September the transportation company conducted a railway operation in Manly to prepare for deployment loading railroad cars with the equipment it will need in Europe. It was one of the largest railroad operations in 20 years.

A send-off ceremony will be held for the local Iowa National Guard company at 9 a.m. today at the North Iowa Events Center in the All Seasons Building.

For some soldiers it is their first time being deployed.

""A month ago I was doing fine and everything. [I'm] a little nervous now and I'm just anxious leaving my family and Iowa itself"" said Sgt. Madison Dutka.

""[I was notified] the day before Thanksgiving last year and I'm just kind of excited. I've always wanted to go somewhere"" said Sgt. Collin Widdel.

Others have deployment experience.

""The first one I was 22 young stupid and didn't know anything. This time I'm going to be celebrating my 37th birthday in Poland"" said Sgt. Matt Platts.

Many of the soldiers received the news that they were being deployed around the Thanksgiving season. Loved ones were supportive but there were feelings of sadness as well.

""They always knew I wanted to deploy. That was my No. 1 goal in the military. They knew that I was very excited so they were supportive in that"" said Dutka.

""Originally they weren't too excited just because I'm in college and I'm actually a senior so I was supposed to graduate this year. They were like 'You should just stay in college and try not to go.' I really feel like it's a once in a lifetime"" said Specialist Bryson Hervol who is a part of 1168th Transportation Company attached to the 1133rd.

""When we found out it was Poland there was a lot less stress and worry because it's a noncombat deployment as of right now and it should stay that way"" said Platts.

Each soldier has made the most of their time leading up to the deployment spending much of it with their families.

""I made sure I went to every sort of family gathering that my family had"" Widdel said.

""I just kind of touch base with a lot of friends and family"" said Hervol.

Dutka a Nora Springs native and her family took the time to celebrate the holidays in advance. She explained that all of her family members have figured out ways to communicate with her while she's deployed.

""My grandma gave me all my cards for Thanksgiving Christmas all of them"" Dutka said with a smile. ""[We've] just been coming together for some of those holidays a little bit beforehand and final goodbyes.""

Mason City native Platts who is married and has two children has been enjoying his time with his family. He even had his work hours shortened to make sure he had more time to share. Both of his children are active with sports and other activities.

""It's hard to be away from the kids and the most I've ever been away from my boys was six weeks. So a whole year is going to be hard for me"" Platts said.

Some soldiers made a point of eating at their favorite diners and dives before deployment. Widdel who is from Reinbeck and Hervol a Waverly native made sure to hit some favorite spots.

""I ate at all the restaurants that I know I'm not going to be able to have for a while"" said Widdel. ""I made food that I know I'm not going to be able to have over there and then basically took advice from people I know that have deployed on things I should do.""

""In Ames there's so many restaurants that I hadn't tried or even gone to. I just was kind of going out a little more than I normally would"" said Hervol.

Hervol is a senior economics major at Iowa State University and said his professors were understanding about him being deployed. He will be taking a few online courses — mainly electives and easier classes — while he is away. Hervol said his professors have been accommodating to his situation and told him to submit assignments when he can.

""I had to take economic metrics which was very math-based. I'll just hold off on that till I get back"" said Hervol.

All members of the 1133rd have established ways to communicate with their families. Some are using phones and video-call services to stay connected. Others are using mail services.

""We discussed WhatsApp. We're going to try that as long as I have service. If not I told them I would send them a letter to notify them that I won't be able to have my phone"" said Dutka.

""I feel like with technology it's so easy to stay in touch"" said Hervol.

The soldiers were appreciative of the support they have received from the community and their families.

""It's not us you have to worry about it's the families at home. They're the ones hurting"" said Platts.

We are going to take a look at Lenovo’s crown jewel workstation… again. We reviewed the Lenovo ThinkStation P620 when the Threadripper Pro 3995WX was king. Now we have the newest WEPYC (workstation EPYC) from AMD in the AMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro 5995WX and we have an updated Lenovo system to boot. As such we did something a little bit different this time: we have competition.

The Lenovo ThinkStation P620 v. Supermicro AS-5014A-TT Video

Since this is largely the same platform as we reviewed last time instead of re-hashing all of the same details we decided to take a look at another offering the market specifically a system from Supermicro. You can find the direct comparison video here:

We also have reviewed the ASUS Pro WS WRX80E-SAGE SE WIFI and Gigabyte MC62-G40 motherboards but we are making a direct comparison against Supermicro since we had these two fully configured systems. For those wondering why the Supermicro one is not coming out first we are rushing behind the scenes due to a number of deadlines but if you want to learn more about the Supermicro system see the above video.

With that let us get to areas of comparison.

Lenovo ThinkStation P620 Overview

If you want to see our full review again see the Lenovo ThinkStation P620 review.

On the front of the system Lenovo still has the card reader we saw on the first unit and four USB ports. Expansion is via a 5.25″ bay and a slim optical drive reader. Supermicro has one fewer USB Type-C port but two extra Type-A ports and more audio jacks. The 5.25″ bays on the Supermicro are hidden behind the door instead of being directly exposed.

Supermicro also has two 2.5″ SATA bays on the front of the system. To fit everything these two workstations take very different approaches. Lenovo is focused on providing a compact platform while Supermicro is notably larger.

On the rear we get the same audio USB PS/2 and networking configuration we saw in our previous review.

Lenovo uses AMD DASH for management while Supermicro has its full server IPMI solution. Supermicro seems to be placing its second Type-C port on the rear of the unit along with seven USB Type-A ports. Lenovo has six. Supermicro also has a 7.1 audio solution with optical output alongside five audio jacks. Lenovo has only three and foregoes the S/PDIF optical output.

Lenovo removes one extra I/O rear slot. Neither motherboard has seven slots so Lenovo has a more compact package.

Lenovo has a great 1kW PSU that is easy to remove in a tool-less fashion like a server power supply. Supermicro has a 1.2kW-2kW PSU but it is cabled.

Next let us get inside the systems.

Lenovo ThinkStation P620 Overview

Lenovo’s handle to get inside the P620 is still excellent and is easier to access than Supermicro’s thumb screw plus button clear cover.

Inside the Lenovo P620 we can see that Lenovo prioritizes direct access to components while Supermicro has an airflow guide to help fill the larger chassis.

Overall Lenovo has great serviceability with features like red coloring for handling points during servicing. Lenovo has an easier retention mechanism for GPUs on both ends.

A unique Lenovo feature is the coolers over memory. Lenovo does not have a lot of airflow over this part of the chassis so these coolers are needed. Lenovo also is using air cooling here instead of liquid cooling.

Lenovo has six PCIe Gen4 x16 expansion slots four x16 and two x8.

Storage for Lenovo comes in the form of two 3.5″ bays (shown above) with two more optional. Lenovo has six SATA III ports and two M.2 SSD areas shown under the heatsink below.

While many of these systems just have a GPU many studios are now embracing large internal local cache storage with cards like the HighPoint SSD7540 8x M.2 NVMe SSD Card Review being added after.

Supermicro has more expansion PCIe lanes (six x16) more M.2 storage slots (4x M.2) and more U.2 (2x U.2) but two fewer SATA ports. The memory capacity and processors can be the same but Lenovo has to trade off some expandability for space.

The biggest difference aside from the space and the expansion comes down to cooling. Lenovo is air-cooled while Supermicro is liquid-cooled. We want to know whether that impacts performance so that is what we are going to explore next in our performance section.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Filed on June 24 the complaint accused Tyson Foods Inc. JBS USA Cargill and National Beef Packing Co. of manipulating the beef market.

Beginning as early as 2015 the meat processors “exploited their market power in this highly concentrated market by conspiring to limit the supply and fix the prices of beef sold to Plaintiff in the US wholesale market” the lawsuit alleged.

A former Swift employee whose identification remains confidential confirmed Sysco’s allegations according to the court documents.

The four companies hold over 80% of the domestic cattle market while the next largest meat processor holds a 2% to 3% share the lawsuit said.

The companies on trial have faced previous accusations regarding price fixing.

Since June 2020 the US Department of Justice has been investigating beef-pricing practices dating back to January 2015 but the DOJ has not yet made an official report on its investigation.

While the company started testing fiber internet last year its main home-focused offering connects with 5G instead of other wired infrastructure like DSL or cable.

Bloomberg reports that the carrier has been working with Citigroup to find financial partners for a potential $4 billion joint venture or “commercial partnership.” It seems like early days for the plan and it’s possible nothing will come of it but it still feels like a significant step for the wireless carrier which has traditionally used and managed a very different kind of infrastructure.

Meanwhile T-Mobile’s current home and business internet offerings (at least the ones that are widely available) rely on its 5G and LTE networks. While that does allow it to roll out coverage more easily than if it had to lay fiber in the ground there are limitations; poor service can lead to a bad user experience and a fiber network will almost certainly outperform a cellular one. For T-Mobile it’d be good to be able to offer both options in some areas: a relatively inexpensive cellular option for people with relatively light internet needs and a fiber offering for power users and people who require rock-solid service.

T-Mobile didn’t immediately respond to The Verge’s request for comment on its search for partners to build a fiber network and about how many users are currently on its fiber home internet pilot. When we wrote about that service in August last year T-Mobile had only made it available in parts of New York City and was using a local fiber provider’s infrastructure instead of its own. According to Bloomberg the carrier has also been looking into other partnerships where it could make a similar arrangement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2ludHJvZHVjaW5nLXRoZS11bi1jYXJyaWVyLW9uLWZyb20tdC1tb2JpbGUtLXRoZS1zbWFydGVzdC1mbHllc3QtY2Fycnktb24tZXZlci0zMDE2NzAyMjMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Introducing the Un-carrier On from T-Mobile - the Smartest Flyest Carry-On Ever USA - English - USA - English,"Introducing the Un-carrier On from T-Mobile – the Smartest Flyest Carry-On Ever (PRNewsfoto/Samsara LuggageT-Mobile)

Morgan Stanley which already has 196000 square feet at the Thames Street Wharf building has signed a lease into 2035 for a total of 242000 square feet announced real estate trust Armada Hoffler today.

Harbor Point located between Harbor East and Fells Point drew T. Rowe Price to move its headquarters away from downtown earlier this year. The city promised a new 4.5-acre park a hotel more retail space and another 550 apartments at Harbor Point. Known as Phase III the new additions are expected to be finished in 2024.

Louis Haddad President and CEO of Armada Hoffler said in a statement today:

“Morgan Stanley’s extension and expansion continues to validate our strong belief that Harbor Point is the top destination for class A companies in the region. The community’s trophy office buildings complemented by what will ultimately be nearly 1000 luxury apartments and some specialty retail all surrounding a 5-acre waterfront park make Harbor Point the premier destination for the top demographic in each of its asset classes.”

Armada Hoffler said it has finalized a lease extension and expansion with Morgan Stanley at the company’s Thames Street Wharf office building. The firm leased an additional 46000 square feet bringing its total office space to 242000 square feet and extended until 2035. Thames Street Wharf is now 100% occupied.

A representative of Morgan Stanley could not be reached Monday.

The company’s website describes the Baltimore office as one of its largest in the U.S. outside the New York headquarters. Morgan Stanley opened its Baltimore office in 2003 with 60 people a number that has grown to close to 2000 employees according to the website. Employees work in areas such as operations finance legal and compliance technology wealth management and risk management.

A Reuters report Thursday said the company is expected to start a round of layoffs globally in the coming weeks as parts of the business have been hurt by rising inflation and an economic downturn. The report said layoffs could affect workers in the Asia Pacific who focus on business in China but could include others globally.

Besides Morgan Stanley Harbor Point also is home to Constellation Energy Group Transamerica EY and RBC Wealth. Baltimore-based T. Rowe Price Group is building a new headquarters there.

Armada Hoffler’s Harbor Point developments also include Constellation Energy and Wills Wharf office buildings. The company is also part of a joint venture with Beatty Development Group to build the mixed-use development Allied | Harbor Point and T. Rowe Price’s new global headquarters both slated for next year.

“The overall plan for Harbor Point has been to create a Class A mixed-use community with strong corporate tenants brand-new apartments along with the retail and lifestyle components that truly make it a premier destination” Haddad said.

“The community’s trophy office buildings complemented by what will ultimately be nearly 1000 luxury apartments and some specialty retail all surrounding a 5-acre waterfront park make Harbor Point the premier destination for the top demographic in each of its asset classes.”

In total the company is reducing its headcount by 14 per cent a move that will bring the company’s number of employees to 7000. The correspondence with staff came across as genuine and the Irish-born co-founders of Stripe appear to have gone to great lengths to provide additional financial and future support to those affected.

The brothers also explained the decision in detail outlying the many factors hurting Stripe – as well as a host of other major technology multinationals – at present.

Patrick Collison said the company “overhired” during the pandemic and was “too optimistic” about the near-term growth of e-commerce. When the pandemic arrived Stripe experienced a massive surge in business as consumers gravitated toward e-commerce.

This led to Stripe increasing headcount at a breakneck pace – according to LinkedIn data Stripe’s employee base more than doubled over the past two years.

The number of staff employed by the Irish-headquartered group of subsidiary companies nearly doubled to 1048 last year. The fastest growth in headcount was sales followed by engineering and user operations. It is unclear yet how many Irish jobs will be lost.

Hiring decisions were easy to justify during the pandemic. As Collison outlined on Friday both revenue and payment volume have since grown more than three-fold since.

However the world has again changed something Collison acknowledged. “We are facing stubborn inflation energy shocks higher interest rates reduced investment budgets and sparser startup funding” he wrote adding that many parts of the world seem to be heading toward recession.

The layoffs are sad but not surprising. When Stripe was last valued in a funding round in March of 2021 it was valued at $95 billion. This was at a peak of market and valuation exuberance. Things have changed radically since so much so that Stripe investors the T. Rowe Price Global Technology Fund cut the value of its Stripe holdings to $23.04 a share as of June 30 a 64 per cent reduction from the end of last year. In July Stripe took the step of reducing its internal valuation to $29 per ordinary share. That was a drop of 27 per cent from the peak.

Stripe is a massive success and a brilliant company. But like many other technology multinationals over the past two years it battled extensively in the war for talent essentially hoarding staff to fuel anticipated growth.

As Nat Friedman the former chief executive of Github put it on Twitter last week: “Many tech companies are 2-10x overstaffed and everyone who’s paying attention already knows this.”

This was something Sean wrote about in investing his column last week when he explained the hiring spree during the pandemic. In 2020 and 2021 during the lockdowns there was a spike in demand for digital products of many kinds. Valuations surged and companies working on the expectation that the pandemic trends would accelerate further kept on hiring.

As Sean put it:

“Looking at skyrocketing revenues and stock prices technology firms went on a hiring spree. Meta and Alphabet were already huge companies in April 2021. Since then they’ve grown headcount by 33 and 38 per cent respectively — 47000 employees for Alphabet and 24000 for Meta. Note that headcount has kept growing in recent quarters long after it was clear that the slowdown was happening.”

And the slowdown has been apparent for a number of months as evident in the downbeat recent quarterly warnings by the likes of Amazon and Meta.

There are other reasons for the tech slump – Sean highlighted last week how Apple’s dominance had forced rivals into risky pivots while in a separate piece he also outlined the fundamental malfunctions within Twitter that Elon Musk has inherited.

Twitter of course was another company to announce heavy job cuts last week along with the likes of Lyft CloudKitchens OpenDoor and Dapper Labs.

Not all have operations in Ireland.

However the ongoing tech slump really matters for Ireland – our industrial model after all is based on securing foreign direct investment from big US multinationals. If they are in retreat the investment will most likely slow down or recede.

We have known about this risk for years and the recent announcement of the €6 billion National Reserve Fund is an acknowledgment of this. The importance of corporate money was highlighted yet again in the tax returns for October published last week.

The state reaped €16.6 billion in corporation tax for the 10 months to the end of October. This was a whopping €6 billion – or 69 per cent – ahead of the same period last year. Receipts for October alone were €2.3 billion which was €800 million up on the same month last year. The tax is expected to break the €20 billion barrier this year.

We know that some of this is one-off in nature. The Department of Finance said last week that the increase related to profits in a small number of companies in the multinational sector “which are unlikely to be repeated next year”.

Instead the excess corporation tax is likely the result of multinationals onshoring intellectual property to Ireland in a tax optimisation scheme known as the Green Jersey.

However many of the companies struggling at present are significant employers here and pay a significant amount of regular recurring corporation tax.

This is what makes the current slide so potentially dangerous for Ireland. As of now the money is rolling in. In the past it has allowed us to cover overruns in the health service and nurse the economy through the pandemic.

However it must now be used strategically to help Ireland expand its industrial model beyond luring and seducing multinationals something Stephen has written about extensively in the past.

Policymakers and commentators have long talked about the concentration risk in relation to corporation tax. While it has not filtered through to our tax take yet we saw last week how quickly the tide can turn for tech companies – no matter how big they are.

The video game gaming company reported second-quarter net revenue of $1.4 billion in line with the company’s guidance and up from $858.2 a year earlier. Shares of Take-Two fell 15 percent after hours Monday.

This is the first full quarter reflecting Take-Two Interactive’s acquisition of Zynga which closed on May 23 2022. Management also said it continued to see consumers impacted by macroeconomic trends leading to pressure on in-game spending even as engagement remains stable.

Net bookings reached $1.5 billion in line with company guidance.

The largest contributors to net revenue in the quarter were NBA 2K22 and NBA 2K23; Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V; Empires & Puzzles; Rollic’s hyper-casual portfolio; Toon Blast; Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online; Words With Friends; Merge Dragons!; and Toy Blast.

“We posted another consecutive quarter of solid results with Net Bookings of $1.5 billion underscoring our ability to launch exciting new games and content updates across our portfolio” said Strauss Zelnick chairman and CEO of Take-Two. “We continue to make excellent progress with our integration of Zynga and we remain highly optimistic about the vast long-term growth potential for the mobile industry which is expected to reach over $160 billion in gross bookings within the next four years.”

Last quarter Zelnick warned of softness in the mobile gaming space due to macroeconomic trends. On Monday Take-Two further reduced its forecast for the year due to “a more cautious view” of those trends.

“We now expect to deliver Net Bookings of $5.4 to $5.5 billion in Fiscal 2023. Our reduced forecast reflects shifts in our pipeline fluctuations in FX rates and a more cautious view of the current macroeconomic backdrop particularly in mobile” management said in the press release.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvMDcvdGFrZS10d28taW50ZXJhY3RpdmUtdHR3by1xMi0yMDIzLWVhcm5pbmdzLmh0bWzSAVNodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMi8xMS8wNy90YWtlLXR3by1pbnRlcmFjdGl2ZS10dHdvLXEyLTIwMjMtZWFybmluZ3MuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Take-Two stock tumbles after it cuts outlook,"Take-Two stock dropped more than 15% in extended trading on Monday after the company reported fiscal second-quarter 2023 results. It said its outlook in the current quarter and for fiscal 2023 would be lower than previously expected.

Here's how the company did:

Loss: $1.54 loss per share

$1.54 loss per share Revenue: $1.5 billion vs. $1.55 billion as expected by analysts according to Refinitiv

Take-Two said in a statement that its fiscal 2023 net bookings would come in between $5.4 billion and $5.5 billion lower than the company's previous expectations of $5.77 billion at the midpoint.

Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv expected $5.88 billion in sales for the year. Take-Two's net bookings primarily includes digital game sales or sales to wholesalers as well as licensing fees and merchandise.

It also said it expects a fiscal year ending March 31 2023 net loss between $674 million to $631 million worse than the guidance of a net loss between $438 million to $398 million that it provided in its first-quarter earnings.

Take-Two's slashed outlook comes as gaming slows and particularly games on mobile devices like smartphones after two years of elevated sales and engagement thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic. Game sales are also being hurt as consumer confidence falls in the face of rising interest rates and a possible recession.

""Our reduced forecast reflects shifts in our pipeline fluctuations in FX rates and a more cautious view of the current macroeconomic backdrop particularly in mobile"" Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said in a statement.

Take-Two is known for games including ""Grand Theft Auto"" and its ""NBA 2K"" series. In September a hacker published some files including the source code of the company's unreleased and highly anticipated title ""Grand Theft Auto 6.""

Take-Two also owns mobile giant Zynga known for ""Words with Friends"" after purchasing it for $12.7 billion earlier this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVzaW5kdXN0cnkuYml6L3Rha2UtdHdvLWxvc3Nlcy1kZWVwZXItdGhhbi1mb3JlY2FzdNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Take-Two losses deeper than forecast,"Sign up for the GI Daily here to get the biggest news straight to your inbox

Take-Two Interactive reported its earnings for the three months ended September 30 today and much like its first quarter the Zynga acquisition and an unfavorable economy were pointed to for significant top-line growth but a negative GAAP bottom line.

Take-Two Interactive Q2 fiscal '23 numbers

Revenue: $1.4 billion (up 62% year-over-year)

$1.4 billion (up 62% year-over-year) Bookings: $1.5 billion (up 53% year-over-year)

$1.5 billion (up 53% year-over-year) Net Loss: $257 million (compared to $10.3 million net income)

In addition to those numbers Take-Two also downgraded its outlook for the full fiscal year ending March 31 2023 citing shifts in the product pipeline foreign currency exchange rates and the impacts of the greater economy especially on the mobile business.

Take-Two forecast

Full-year GAAP revenue forecast: $5.4 billion to $5.51 billion (previously $5.73 billion to $5.83 billion in revenue)

$5.4 billion to $5.51 billion (previously $5.73 billion to $5.83 billion in revenue) Full-year GAAP Net Loss: $631 million to $674 million (previously a $398 million to $438 million net loss)

Speaking with GamesIndustry.biz in advance of the earnings release Take-Two chairman and CEO Strauss Zelnick remained upbeat about the results.

""It was a great solid quarter"" he said. ""It's a somewhat disappointing outlook for the year. However that's not surprising given the economic backdrop and our expectations for the macroeconomy. And we remain in terrific shape with 87 titles coming between fiscal '23 and fiscal '25 and expectations that we're going to generate sequential growth in those years and record results.""

Zelnick pointed to the company's pre-tax profits a strong lineup – ""All of our titles are working"" – and full-year guidance for strong bookings growth and operating cash flow of $650 million as good indicators of the company's current health.

""We have the best collection of owned intellectual property in the business"" Strauss Zelnick

""We have the best collection of owned intellectual property in the business and we're exposed basically equally to mobile and console"" Zelnick said. ""Mobile is the fastest growing part of the interactive entertainment business and interactive entertainment is the fastest growing part of the entertainment business.""

That said the $257 million net loss for the second quarter was significantly larger than Take-Two's forecasted range of $144 million to $160 million. When asked what was behind that Take-Two executive VP of finance Hannah Sage said it was due to a revaluation of intangible assets that came over in the Zynga acquisition.

""We do have a year post-close to continue to refine those estimates"" Sage said ""and one of the bigger ones with a shorter life was revalued and so that was driving the change. It also drove the full-year GAAP guidance change.""

When asked if the company believed it was now done with Zynga revaluations Sage said there could be further adjustments to those estimates to come.

The Zynga acquisition has also shifted Take-Two's revenue mix even further to digital with the company only seeing 6% of bookings for the quarter from physical retailers compared to 11% a year ago.

The size of retail's contribution has dropped even in terms of absolute numbers with bookings down 23% to $84 million for the quarter.

""75% of our net bookings on the console side are now digital delivered"" Zelnick said. ""I've been asked repeatedly over the years what that percentage will look like in five years and I say 100%. You can still sell hardware at retail you can still sell digital codes and Shark Cards at retail but there are indeed some challenges and to say otherwise wouldn't fully capture the situation.""

However Zelnick said retail would continue to be ""a very valuable marketing tool… as long as people are showing up there.""

As for specific titles the usual suspects from the Take-Two and Zynga catalogs led revenue contributors for the quarter. The new release NBA 2K23 and its predecessor NBA 2K22 received top billing there followed by a pack including Grand Theft Auto 5 and Online Empires & Puzzles Rollic's portfolio of hypercasual games Toon Blast Red Dead Redemption 2 and Online Words with Friends Merge Dragons and Toy Blast.

NBA 2K23 sold-in nearly 5 million units since its September debut. While NBA 2K22 made it all the way to 5 million in its launch quarter last year the publisher noted that 2K23 has had a higher average selling price than its predecessor and with significant growth in virtual currency sales as well.

NBA 2K23 has also seen 2 million daily active users so far.

In other stalwart franchise news Grand Theft Auto 5 may finally be running out of steam. Take-Two's latest sales update is that it was sold-in more than 170 million copies worldwide. Last quarter the company had it at ""nearly"" 170 million copies sold-in.

Sage said the company only updates the game's sales total in 5 million increments at this point adding that Take-Two has always forecast an eventual decline for it and it still exceeded expectations for the previous quarter.

Red Dead Redemption 2 has also topped 46 million copies sold-in worldwide up from 45 million last quarter.

On the Zynga side of the business the most substantial performance data given was that Rollic has surpassed 2 billion lifetime downloads worldwide. The company also said that Zynga's in-app purchases business was ""under some pressure due to current macroeconomic conditions.""

""It's a fragmented business and there's plenty of opportunity for all of us to do well"" Strauss Zelnick

Beyond the earnings we asked Zelnick about recent comments he made on the proposed Microsoft acquisition of Activision Blizzard being good for the industry if it goes through. Zelnick had said Microsoft was an ally so it would benefit Take-Two as well so we brought up Sony's status as an ally of Take-Two's and its insistence that the deal would not be good for the industry.

""It's a fragmented business and there's plenty of opportunity for all of us to do well"" Zelnick said. ""And we just acquired a big company in Zynga so it seems a little silly for us to acquire a big company on the one hand and say that's totally fine and on the other hand if Microsoft seeks to acquire a company in the space that's not OK. It's still a business where very small companies can create very big results and big companies can create big results as well.

""I think Microsoft and Sony are engaged in a console battle and they're also involved in a subscription battle. We are not in either of those businesses.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNoYWNrbmV3cy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xMzMwMDUvdGFrZS10d28taW50ZXJhY3RpdmUtdHR3by1xMi0yMDIzLWVhcm5pbmdzLXJlc3VsdHPSAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5zaGFja25ld3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMTMzMDA1L3Rha2UtdHdvLWludGVyYWN0aXZlLXR0d28tcTItMjAyMy1lYXJuaW5ncy1yZXN1bHRzP2FtcGh0bWw9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) Q2 2023 earnings results miss EPS and revenue expectations,"Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) Q2 2023 earnings results miss EPS and revenue expectations Take-Two Interactive fell short of expectations in both earnings-per-share and revenue for its Q2 2023 quarterly finish.

As we continue to trek through the end of fiscal quarters at various tech and gaming companies Take-Two Interactive finds itself up on the block this week to kick things off. The company reported today though unfortunately it fell short of expectations in its major metrics. Overall revenue and earnings-per-share (EPS) were both down for Take-Two Interactive in Q2 2023 and it has the company lowering its full year guidance as a result.

Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) shared its Q2 2023 earnings results on its investor relations website on November 7 2022. According to the results Take-Two put up $1.4 billion USD in revenue. That was short of expectations that were set at $1.52 billion as reported by Whisper Number. Additionally it not only missed on consensus EPS estimates of $1.37 per share and Whisper Number expectations of $1.42 per share. It actually lost money putting up a loss of -$1.54 per share.

Take-Two Interactive's (TTWO) stock took a dive after the revenue miss and major EPS miss in its Q2 2023 quarterly earnings results.

Source: Google

As could be expected this could be considered a losing quarter for Take-Two Interactive and the TTWO stock is down in afterhours trading as a result. The company still has games like NBA 2K PGA Tour 2K23 and The Quarry which have helped moved to the needle positively for the group but it also just recently dropped $12.7 billion on the acquisition of Zynga which it has previously pointed out would significantly affect its fiscal 2023 bottom line and expectations. Groups like Rockstar continue to work towards an all-new Grand Theft Auto but it’s still a long ways off to say the least.

Even so Take-Two has already said a new Grand Theft Auto most likely won’t launch until around 2025. As such the company may be in for some rough times while it works towards its next flagship launch. Stay tuned as we continue to report on various tech company quarterly closes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvdGFrZS10d28tZGVlcGVucy12aWRlb2dhbWUtaW5kdXN0cnktZ2xvb20td2l0aC1hbm51YWwtZm9yZWNhc3QtY3V0LTIwMjItMTEtMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Take-Two slumps as forecast cut deepens videogame industry gloom,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/technology/take-two-deepens-videogame-industry-gloom-with-annual-forecast-cut-2022-11-07/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvdGFrZS10d28tZGVlcGVucy12aWRlb2dhbWUtaW5kdXN0cnktZ2xvb20td2l0aC1hbm51YWwtZm9yZWNhc3QtY3V0LTIwMjItMTEtMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) will hold a virtual special meeting of shareholders on Wednesday November 30 at 10 am Eastern Time.

Shareholders will be asked to vote on two proposals including changes to the company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation or its “charter.” Under the current charter TMAC has to consummate its business combination on February 5 2023.

TMAC emerged back in January 2021 when Music Business Worldwide revealed that long-time Geffen Records President Neil Jacobson was plotting a flotation of a new music company in the US.

Jacobson’s blank-check company The Music Acquisition Corporation (TMAC) floated on the New York Stock Exchange in February last year under the ticker symbol TMAC.U raising $230 million in the process.

TMAC.U formed specifically to effect a merger/acquisition in the worlds of both music rights and music tech has been largely quiet since then – something that now doesn’t look likely to change in the near future.

Now according to a filing with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) in the US Jacobson’s SPAC has written to its stockholders to seek approval via a vote to liquidate early.

The scheduled meeting will also determine whether shareholders will approve TMAC’s plan to liquidate its trust account worth $230 million. They will be voting on changes to TMAC’s agreement with the company’s trustee Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Co.

If approved the company will redeem all of its outstanding Class A common shares by the end of the year earlier than the previously agreed upon date on February 5 2023 or the contractual termination date.

Under US listing rules SPACs that fail to merge with a target company within two years since going public should be dissolved and return all funds to investors.

Since debuting on the NYSE in February TMAC still has yet to combine with another entity. TMAC recently disclosed that its management has reviewed an undisclosed number of potential targets but has “not entered into an agreement to effect a business combination with any of these potential targets for a variety of reasons”.

The reasons include the parties’ inability to reach a consensus on valuation; a preliminary assessment of a potential target company’s business model customer concentration competitive landscape and risks to future financial performance; an assessment of the relevant target company’s ability to execute its business and financial plans and grow its business; and alternative options available to potential targets like pursuing traditional IPOs or waiting for the capital markets to improve before going public.

The news comes as a report from CNBC citing new data from SPAC Research notes that 27 SPAC deals worth $12.8 billion have been liquidated in 2022 so far.

CNBC notes that SPACs have been prompted to ‘close up shop’ due to President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act which imposes a 1% excise tax on stock ‘buybacks’ after December 31 2022.

Unsurprisingly Jacobson’s SPAC also cites President Jo Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act and the incoming 1% excise tax on repurchasing stock in its filing.

Another factor that TMAC identified is the new regulatory landscape in the US as the SEC is pushing to enhance disclosure in mergers involving SPACs and private operating companies.

“Our board of directors believes that the SEC’s proposed rules if adopted whether in the form proposed or in revised form may materially increase the time required to negotiate and complete an initial business combination and could further impair our ability to complete an initial business combination” by or before February 2023 TMAC added.

TMAC’s inability to enact a merger highlights the challenges faced by SPACs in the current market.

The blank-check company determined “that it is very unlikely that we would be able to complete a business combination” after careful consideration.

TMAC’s shareholders may request the company to redeem all or a portion of their shares for cash if the charter amendment proposal is approved the company said.

Holders of the firm’s NYSE-listed units must vote to separate the underlying public shares and public warrants before exercising redemption rights TMAC added.

National Grid’s lawsuit against Wipro its system integrator was eventually settled out of court for $75 million but that didn’t come close to covering the losses.

10. Worth & Co.: Interminable rollout leads to a lawsuit at the source

Worth & Co. is a Pennsylvania-based manufacturing company that just wanted a new ERP system and after hearing several pitches in 2014 decided to hire EDREi Solutions to implement Oracle’s E-Business Suite. The first go-live date was November 2015. But things began to slip. The deadline was pushed back to February 2016. At that point Oracle demanded that Worth & Co. pony up $260000 for training courses and support contracts. But 2016 came and went and still no rollout. In 2017 Worth & Co. jettisoned EDREi for another integrator Monument Data Solutions. Another year was spent attempting without success to customize Oracle’s suite for Worth & Co.’s purposes.

Finally after the project was abandoned Worth & Co. did something novel in February 2019: they sued not their IT vendor but Oracle specifically citing the $4.5 million they paid the software giant for licenses professional services and training. The lawsuit is still ongoing.

11. Target Canada: Garbage in garbage out

Many companies rolling out ERP systems hit snags when it comes to importing data from legacy systems into their shiny new infrastructure. When Target was launching in Canada in 2013 though they assumed they would avoid this problem: there would be no data to convert just new information to input into their SAP system.

But upon launch the company’s supply chain collapsed and investigators quickly tracked the fault down to this supposedly fresh data which was riddled with errors — items were tagged with incorrect dimensions prices manufacturers you name it. Turns out thousands of entries were put into the system by hand by entry-level employees with no experience to help them recognize when they had been given incorrect information from manufacturers working on crushingly tight deadlines. An investigation found that only about 30% of the data in the system was actually correct.

12. PG&E: When ‘sample’ data isn’t

Some rollouts aim to tackle this sort of problem by testing new systems with production data generally imported from existing databases. This can ensure that data errors are corrected before rollout — but production data is valuable stuff containing a lot of confidential and proprietary information and it needs to be guarded with the same care as it would in actual production.

In May 2016 Chris Vickery risk analyst at UpGuard discovered a publicly exposed database that appeared to be Pacific Gas and Electric’s asset management system containing details for over 47000 PG&E computers virtual machines servers and other devices — completely open to viewing without username or password required. While PG&E initially denied this was production data Vickery says that it was and was exposed as a result of an ERP rollout: a third-party vendor was given live PG&E data in order to fill a “demo” database and test how it would react in real production practice. They then failed to supply any of the protection a real production database would need.

Surviving an ERP rollout

So what have we learned? Well don’t fall afoul of regulators make sure your data is secure and clean and document your processes before you move to a new platform — all good advice for any rollout or any other big IT project really.

The separately incorporated investment management organization says it has also made considerable progress toward its commitment to divest by 2030 from indirect investments in fossil fuel companies which are typically held through pooled and commingled investment vehicles. The endowment portfolio also referred to as the Long-Term Capital Appreciation Pool comprises the university’s endowment funds plus other investment assets and was valued at approximately $3.8 billion as of April 30.

UTAM’s progress which builds on its success in reducing the overall carbon footprint of the endowment portfolio is captured in the organization’s latest responsible investing report.

“In October of 2021 we pledged to divest the endowment portfolio from holdings in fossil fuel companies to achieve net-zero carbon emissions associated with the endowment portfolio by 2050 and to allocate 10 per cent of the endowment portfolio’s assets to sustainable and low-carbon investments by 2025” President Gertler said.

Regarding the commitment to allocate at least 10 per cent of the endowment portfolio to sustainable and low-carbon investments by 2025 UTAM is making progress and is comfortable that it will reach that target ahead of schedule.

“As global challenges imperil the worldwide effort to meet our Paris Accord obligations the advances made by UTAM and the University of Toronto reaffirm our own commitment to achieving those goals” President Gertler said.

The report comes as U of T was ranked second in the world and first in Canada in a new sustainability ranking by London-based Quacquarelli Symonds. The ranking assessed the environmental and social impact of 700 post-secondary institutions around the world and took into account sustainable investing strategies.

Beginning in 2023 UTAM plans to integrate its annual responsible investing update into its annual report (rather than issuing a separate report) a reflection of how deeply UTAM’s responsible investing commitment is embedded into its investment approach.

“Responsible investing is no longer novel or exceptional but an integral part of good investment practice” President Gertler said. “Normalizing responsible investing practices particularly within the Canadian post-secondary education sector has been one of UTAM’s central accomplishments.”

U of T has been a sustainable finance leader in the university sector. In partnership with McGill University U of T led the creation of Investing to Address Climate Change: A Charter for Canadian Universities. UTAM also helped launch the University Network for Investor Engagement  facilitated by SHARE to address climate-related portfolio risks with collective action and was the first university-affiliated institutional investor in the world to join the United Nations-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance – a group of institutional investors committed to transitioning their investment portfolios to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

Carbon footprint reduction target met ahead of schedule more ambitious target set

UTAM has reduced the carbon footprint of the equity securities component of the endowment portfolio by more than 40 per cent meeting its reduction target almost a decade ahead of schedule.

“That success allowed us to set a new even more ambitious carbon footprint target” said Chuck O’Reilly UTAM’s president and chief investment officer. “In accordance with the Alliance’s target-setting protocol we’ve set a new carbon footprint reduction goal of 50 per cent by 2030 measured against a 2019 baseline.

“Responsible investing is an ongoing commitment requiring continuous refinement of our investment processes. Responsible investing helps us advance the university’s sustainability goals while delivering on our mission of producing strong investment results over the long term.”

UTAM engaged audit and assurance firm PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to review UTAM’s 2021 carbon footprint calculation; PwC’s independent limited assurance opinion is included in the 2021 Responsible Investing Report.

In September 2022 Teledyne e2v released Optimom 2M the first in a range of MIPI CSI-2 modules to address this very challenge. The module combines the latest innovations in imaging and optics into one turnkey imaging solution by mounting a proprietary image sensor onto a board with a fixed lens and optional Multi Focus lens technology. But what are those innovations and how do they work? What benefits do they bring to vision-based systems?

Image Sensor Innovations

The Optimom 2M module features Topaz 2M a 2-Megapixel global shutter CMOS image sensor that combines multiple innovations from pixel structure to packaging right through to the chip design itself.

In a world where pure product performance would be the one and only driver in product development vision system makers would select the largest possible pixel to maximize the sensitivity and saturation capacity of the device. However in the real world where money footprint and power consumption all play a role vision system makers must balance their desire to maximize the optical performance of the system within size and cost constraints by looking for image sensors with optimum electro-optical performance that can still fit into a certain optical format.

Depending on the target optical format the maximum acceptable pixel size can become a technological challenge. Also going from one optical format to a smaller one (e.g. from 1.1-inch to 1-inch) often implies a significant reduction of pixel pitch as highlighted in Figure 2.

Figure 1. Image of the Topaz 2M image sensor on a finger for scale.

Topaz 2M features the world’s smallest global shutter pixel which allows it to be matched with compact and cost-effective 1/3-inch lenses while still maximizing sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio. This pixel developed by the TowerJazz foundry using their 65nm technology enables it to perform global shutter operation in a small 2.5μm square size by leveraging the concept of shared pixel structure. In the case of the Topaz 2M sensor an 8T-shared pixel structure has been adopted eight transistors being shared by two pixels in diagonal therefore combining the advanced features from 6T pixel structures such as in-pixel reduction (a.k.a. CDS or Correlated Double Sampling) and the improved sensitivity of 4T structures with only four transistors occupying the surface of each pixel.

Figure 2. The maximum pixel pitch in order to fit a certain resolution in a specific optical format.

A Well-Thought-Out Optical Stack

On top of this structure the Topaz 2M sensor and the Optimom 2M module benefit from improved sensitivity due to a disruptive optical stack structure on top of the pixel. The pixel optimizes pixel pitch with a gapless top lens to avoid light loss and unwanted reflections but the real invention lies in the so-called “dual light-pipe” architecture that directly guides light onto the photodiode through micro-optical fibers created in the optical stack of the sensor which plays with materials of different reflective indexes.

Figure 3. Sectional view of the optical structure of the integrated pixel.

The image shown in Figure 3 presents a cross-view of the optical stack that is embedded into the products.

Chip Packaging

Apart from optimizing pixel size and optical structure image sensors can now also benefit from advances in packaging technology to reduce sensor cost weight and footprint. For a few years wafer-level packaging technologies have been booming in the market especially for consumer applications such as mobile automotive or wearables.

While Ceramic Land Grid Array (CLGA) packages have been used in the industry for many years now the recent technological advances in reducing pixel size have opened the door to wafer-level packages even for higher-end image sensors meant for industrial inspection logistics or robotics. CLGA packages require an individual packaging of the die into a ceramic structure with spaced lands at the back for connecting to the sensor board whereas wafer-level packages are produced in batches of wafers.

In the case of fan-out wafer-level packages the silicon wafers are diced into individual sensor dies that are all embedded into a remolded glass substrate wafer which is then cut into individually packaged sensors. The process and package size optimizations go one step further with another category of wafer-level packaging: chip scale packaging in which the silicon wafer is directly packaged into the material without the intermediate step of molding a glass substrate around it. This leads to ever smaller and more compact image sensors. For both categories of wafer-level packaging the back connection of the image sensor to the board is ensured by balls that provide higher density connections an excellent solution to the challenge of producing miniature and lightweight imaging solutions for embedded systems such as drones or automated guided vehicles.

The recent combination of these pixel sensor structure and packaging innovations has enabled a new generation of image sensors with footprints that have reduced by a factor of four over only five years as highlighted with the timeline and examples shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4. Evolution of image sensor footprint with package and pixel technologies since 2016.

Apart from the packaging technology the design of the sensor die to be packaged can also have an impact on the size of the final system. One of the key tricks available for image sensor manufacturers is to minimize the final system housing by matching the package center with the optical center to the exact same position. The impact of a mismatch between optical and package centers as still observed in some image sensors today is illustrated in Figure 5.

Figure 5. Illustration of the loss of space when the die optical center is not centered in the package.

A Novel Technology

While the downscale in pixel pitch has a positive impact on the cost and size of image sensors it has been quite detrimental to the versatility of optical systems especially depth of field.

Depth of field which can be defined as the difference between the closest and furthest distance at which an object can be captured with sufficient levels of sharpness reduces as the pixel size shrinks and tolerance to out-of-focus images becomes smaller. For applications that require objects to be captured at various working distances (such as for parcel tracking in logistics centers) it becomes usual for system makers to look for close aperture optics (F/7.0 or F/8.0 typically) to maintain a sufficient depth of field despite pixel size reduction.

Unfortunately closing the aperture comes at the expense of light sensitivity as less light passes through the lens to be captured by the image sensor. Therefore the challenge for focus adjustment technologies is to now enable a wide depth of field while maintaining high sensitivity of the vision system. This is precisely the issue solved by the Multi-Focus lens technology developed in the Optimom 2M optical module which combines a wide F/4.0 aperture with broad working distances from 10 cm to infinity.

Figure 6. Left: Back view wof the Optimom 2M module with FFC/FPC connector to control the sensor and the lens focus. Right: Front view of Optimom 2M module with a Multi-Focus lens embedded.

This proprietary lens stack technology reaches these performances by modifying the external shape of the lens to adjust the focus. The control of the lens shape is ensured electronically by means of I 2C protocol signals that are directly managed through the standard FFC/ FPC connector at the back of the module board. This connector handles MIPI CSI-2 data output clock management as well as image sensor and Multi-Focus lens control through I2C. This concept enables the Multi-Focus to benefit from multiple advantages compared to other focus adjustment technologies such as fast response time < 1ms and resistance to electromagnetic effects.

Summary

The Optimom 2M optical module achieves state-of-the-art electro-optical performances and high versatility by leveraging multiple innovations. The embedded image sensor combines innovations in pixel structure optical stack and die packaging to enable a tiny and lightweight design able to match affordable S-mount lenses while maintaining a high level of sensitivity. The optional integrated Multi-Focus lens relies on a new focus adjustment technology which enables the combination of a broad working distance high sensitivity and fast response time.

Ride in style with free service featuring the latest Tesla,"Panthers who don't own cars and others who simply want to use their gas-guzzlers less frequently have an easy no-cost option for short-distance runs to and from MMC. And now they'll even be riding in style.

The Freebee service that provides free trips to students has replaced its electric open-air shuttles with a fleet of six Model X Teslas.

The new cars revolutionize the way students without transportation go grocery shopping visit nearby friends or get back to the main campus from the Engineering Center.

“The Tesla Freebee rides are great for our students” said Tom Hartley assistant vice president of Parking & Transportation at FIU. “Not everybody has a car and car ownership is expensive especially in Miami. It is critical for us to help provide a community where you can live and work and not have to have a car.”

Free on-demand transportation services are available to the entire FIU community through the Ride Freebee app. Trips up to about three miles so long as they either begin or end at MMC or the Engineering Center cost nothing while cutting down on congestion and emissions.

The new electric vehicles align with the university’s goal to reduce its carbon footprint and create a more sustainable campus environment. To that end FIU has installed at MMC BBC and the Engineering Center a total of 16 electric vehicle charging stations available for the nominal fee of $1 per hour with plans to add more as needed and 11 cost-free tire inflations stations to increase Panthers' vehicle fuel efficiency. And the Parking & Transportation team plans to replace the existing buses that go between MMC and BBC with newer greener versions.

Hartley expects up to a 30% increase in the current number of Freebee trips since the Tesla upgrade. Freebee which has been serving FIU since 2020 currently provides about 5000 rides to Panthers per month.

“It’s really all about safety comfort productivity and efficiency” Hartley said noting that the previous vehicles had a maximum speed of 25 miles per hour and had to take slower back-road routes and also were open-air vehicles which exposed the riders to unpredictable weather changes. “Being able to keep folks on campus safe is huge especially when you don’t know what the weather will do next.”

Aaliyah Mesidort a junior who studies biology and has frequently used Freebee loves the service. “Freebee is very convenient for people who don’t have cars especially when they’re trying to go do grocery shopping. It definitely takes a load off your back” she said. “The Teslas make it even better: they have air conditioning can go on the main roads look cooler and are still free.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2xlZ2FsL211c2stZm9jdXNlcy10d2l0dGVyLWhpcy01Ni1iaWxsaW9uLXRlc2xhLXBheS1nb2VzLXRyaWFsLTIwMjItMTEtMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,As Musk focuses on Twitter his $56 billion Tesla pay goes to trial,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/legal/musk-focuses-twitter-his-56-billion-tesla-pay-goes-trial-2022-11-07/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2xlZ2FsL211c2stZm9jdXNlcy10d2l0dGVyLWhpcy01Ni1iaWxsaW9uLXRlc2xhLXBheS1nb2VzLXRyaWFsLTIwMjItMTEtMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vY2xlYW50ZWNobmljYS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS8wNy90ZXNsYS10YWtlcy1vdmVyLXNlbWEtc2hvdy1pbi1sYXMtdmVnYXMtcGhvdG8tZ2FsbGVyeS_SAV9odHRwczovL2NsZWFudGVjaG5pY2EuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvMDcvdGVzbGEtdGFrZXMtb3Zlci1zZW1hLXNob3ctaW4tbGFzLXZlZ2FzLXBob3RvLWdhbGxlcnkvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Takes Over SEMA Show in Las Vegas (Photo Gallery),"Sign up for daily news updates from CleanTechnica on email. Or follow us on Google News

The SEMA show in Las Vegas is the largest automotive specialty parts trade show in the world drawing over 160000 attendees. I attended the show last week to check out new parts and accessories that Tesla owners might be interested in — some will be premiering (on EVANNEX) soon. However I also encountered some wild customized Teslas that showcase a significant design departure from the standard factory look.

Of all the Teslas on display at SEMA perhaps the coolest was from @casper_model3 from the elite @ruinedtesla crew. The Tesla included some mods from EVANNEX along with a gorgeous body kit via @andro.inc. Many of these modded Teslas have their frunks popped open to display the vehicle’s air suspension “bagged” mods including Casper’s very cool SpaceX-styled tank. It’s no wonder this Tesla was featured on the cover of DUB Magazine‘s SEMA issue.

Cruising between the halls at the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC) required a lot of walking. To make things a bit more fun our crew decided to travel in style via the LVCC Loop. Elon Musk’s The Boring Company dug a massive underground tunnel with Tesla vehicles ferrying SEMA attendees around the show. It was a really cool experience.

While some Teslas on display at SEMA were nothing more than vinyl wraps and aftermarket wheels there were some radical collaborations — bringing together like-minded companies in order to transform Tesla’s design aesthetic and create a fresh new look. What I encountered was really striking. So I decided to document it all (via my iPhone) and report back to you with some eye candy. Check out the photo gallery below.

He used it until it wore out and it became my hand-me-down car when I was old enough to drive. Growing up I had to keep the Morris running myself or I wasn’t going anywhere. My dad was a jack-of-all-trades—he once yanked a broken automatic transmission out of his early-sixties Ford F-100 pickup and fixed it himself—and he passed on that go-to-it mentality to my brother and me. We love to tackle new projects.

Eventually I left home and started driving other cars. In the late eighties I ran into a guy who had a Morris Minor truck sitting in his yard that he didn’t want anymore. It was so similar to my Traveller wagon. We worked out a swap for an IBM PC that I had lying around so then I had an old Morris deteriorating in my yard for the next decade.

Even back in the early nineties my brother and I talked about building an electric car but the technology just wasn’t ready yet. The batteries were too heavy all acid and corrosion. But I’d look out at the Morris in my yard and think that it would make the perfect electric car. Here’s how I converted that tired old gas guzzler (well as guzzly as a little British pickup could be) into a smooth efficient electric vehicle—and how surprisingly easy it was to pull off.

Ian Allen After pulling out the old engine and transmission and all the lines and hoses that those parts require there was plenty of room under the Morris Minor’s hood for a couple of batteries (more are in the rear) and a small motor controller.

The best donor cars for EV swaps are often older lightweight vehicles with a manual transmission. New vehicles make a conversion almost impossible. They’re so complicated—with countless interconnected components computers and sensors—that it’s hard to make sense of it all. But I knew the Morris inside and out from wrenching on mine as a teenager.

By 2014 the technology and parts to do an electric conversion were becoming available. This was just after the Model S came out and I went to the showroom at Tesla’s factory in Fremont California to see it. That got me excited to convert the old Morris into an EV.

Even though they are simple compared to modern vehicles old cars still have a lot of moving parts. There’s the engine and transmission differentials and all manner of pumps and fuel lines and the like. An EV in some ways is much simpler: There’s the electric motor to power the wheels; a motor controller which is the brains of the operation; and a battery to power everything. At a very basic level that’s all you need to get going.

While you could use a motor from a donor EV like the Nissan Leaf those components are deeply integrated into a modern car’s electronic controls and constantly receiving feedback from different sensors in the vehicle such as the traction control and antilock braking systems. You can’t just use one in a conversion without spending a lot of time dissecting everything and tricking the motor into thinking it’s in the right car. Instead it’s better to just buy a motor specifically designed for this because all the work has been done already.

The first motor and controller I tried for my Morris came from a company called HPEVS which originally made electric propulsion equipment for golf carts. I picked the AC-51 induction motor which is made for lighter vehicles like mine. It makes around 88 horsepower and 108 lb-ft of torque. That might not seem like a lot but it’s not a large vehicle and the most powerful Morris Minor made only 49 horsepower from a tiny 1.1-liter engine when new. It cost me about $5500.

Using your old transmission in your EV conversion is a simple way to drive power from your new motor to the wheels. There are off-the-shelf adapter plates that allow you to mount an electric motor directly to the transmission (though some cars may need custom-made adapters).



That wouldn’t work for me though. I knew from my youth that the transmission in the Morris was rather weak. I tore it up more than once. With the modest amount of power in my electric motor there was no reason to have a transmission in an electric car like this anyway so I went direct drive and never looked back. Plus the old transmission and the new electric motor I used were about the same size which made it easy for me to mount the motor in its place.

To mount the motor I made a crossmember for the front of the new motor and used the original crossmember from the transmission. I attached the new motor to each of them with a pair of L brackets adding rubber bushings to insulate the motor from vibrations coming through the frame. After those few simple steps we were golden.

When I started on the Morris I bought 48 new lithium-ion prismatic battery cells at 3.2 volts and 200 amp hours per cell which worked out to 30.720 kilowatt-hours at 144 volts nominal. That cost me around $15000 but I eventually replaced them with batteries from a crashed Model S at a junkyard where I paid $7000 for seven packs. The cost of batteries scales linearly with their capacity so you can spend almost whatever you want here.

A battery-management system isn’t strictly necessary but it does a few things that make owning and operating your homemade EV a bit easier. The system monitors the individual cell voltage in the battery pack and ensures that they’re all functioning at precisely the same voltage which you want for optimal performance. More importantly to me because I’m a programmer by trade it provides a ton of information about the car’s performance. Many people won’t care about these figures but as a programmer I want to know everything.

Ian Allen Ricketts an engineer checks the data from his battery-management system. You can buy a less sophisticated system to save money if you don’t want as much information. Ian Allen A DC-to-DC converter pulls a charge from the batteries to power the car’s radio and other electrical systems eliminating the standard 12-volt car battery. Not even a Tesla does that.

My system which cost about $1200 tells me the amount of current used temperatures inside the battery pack and other neat data. And it connects to an Android-powered head unit in my car so I can view it just like I would on one of those big Tesla infotainment screens. There’s also an onboard AC/DC converter that you’ll need to install to allow for charging the batteries.

Most commercial electric cars include a 12-volt battery to power things like the radio and power-window motors but since I designed this system myself I could do something different. I added a DC-to-DC converter that takes power from the main high-voltage battery and converts it to 12 volts DC. I have it configured so that the converter runs 24/7. It draws a tiny bit of power out of the main battery pack as it does so but it eliminates the need for a separate 12-volt battery. A Tesla can’t do that yet but Elon Musk has talked about trying it. I also added an inertia switch which de-energizes the battery if you get in a significant crash.

One nice thing about electric cars is that it really doesn’t matter where everything goes aside from the motor. You can run the cables and wires wherever you need to so I installed the battery-management system the motor controller and the DC-to-DC converter up in the engine bay at the front of the car. There was plenty of room in there to make everything look good and also to make it easy to swap out or upgrade components later on.

Because I was restoring the body as well as converting it to an EV I had the electrical components up and running before the body panels went on so I was able to drive it around as an empty shell which was amusing. This is effectively a body-on-frame vehicle so there isn’t much of an upper structure to it. I installed batteries where the now-unnecessary fuel tank was and where the spare tire would have been carried.

I kept the brakes just the way they were—I press the pedal and it squeezes the calipers. I didn’t mess around with connecting them to the motor to increase regenerative braking the way some EVs do. Instead I can adjust regen directly through the motor controller. That makes it more like motor braking slowing the driveshaft when I let off the gas. I only run that at 60 percent capacity though. Anything higher than that and I’d be awfully close to locking up the rear wheels when I let up on the throttle. So I have something close to one-pedal driving and the standard brakes are there too.

Morris Minors have rack-and-pinion steering and are easy to drive without power assist so I didn’t need to mess with anything there in terms of the original design. For conversions that require power steering you can add electric pumps. You also can get electric air-conditioning pumps if you wish. (I added AC to my electric pickup—another EV conversion I’m working on—for about $800 in parts.)

Even with the fancy modern propulsion system I wanted to keep a traditional look and feel to everything. The mechanical linkage on the original gas pedal is joined to a potentiometer that’s in turn connected to the motor controller. A traditional speedometer would have connected from the transmission but I had removed that. Rather than mess with trying to hook it up to the motor controller I dropped in a GPS-based analog speedometer cluster designed for an old Jeep which made life a whole lot easier. There are even options to link your original speedometer to a GPS controller if you really want to keep things authentic.

The new speedometer also has an analog fuel gauge which I wired up to the battery-management system. It sends a zero-to-5V output to the fuel gauge based on the battery’s charge. That’s what most people care about so when it reads full the battery is charged. When it’s empty it’s empty. Simple! I don’t have my temperature display hooked to anything but you could use it to monitor battery or motor temperature if you wanted to.

Ian Allen The speedometer cluster was made to fit some older Jeeps but it slid into the Morris almost perfectly. It uses GPS signals to calculate speed making it easier to install than a hardwired system. There’s even an analog fuel gauge that Ricketts connected to the battery-management system.

I kept the original “W” and “L” knobs for the windshield wiper and headlights and the original key acts as a simple on-off switch that turns on the motor controller.

I removed the original choke knob and the “S” pull-cable for the starter solenoid. I replaced those with the kind of forward/reverse switch often seen on golf carts along with a single chrome button that can change modes on the motor controller. In the end I used all four original holes in the dash for the various controls because I hate drilling new holes and I really hate leaving holes unused.

I mounted the charging port where the gas cap used to be and it’s capable of Level 2 charging which runs on a 240-volt circuit at my home. The battery-management system supervises charging in case something goes wrong but the onboard battery charger handles most of it.

At night I plug the car in. My wall charger is programmed to start up after 10 p.m. to save on pricey California electricity. The Morris charges as needed and is ready to go in the morning. If I were to drain the pack completely it would take about 14 hours to charge. Charging speed on a Level 2 residential charger depends on the vehicle’s internal capabilities. (The 2.5-kilowatt unit I used cost about $600.) If you want to fill up faster at home you can opt for a fancier one capable of 6.6 kilowatt-hour speeds for example.

It’s difficult for me to stop tinkering with my builds even after they’re operable. I’m still upgrading the Morris. I replaced my 12V DC-to-DC converter because the original one would occasionally turn off for a brief period and the electronics didn’t like that. And eventually I changed the driveshaft for one with a center carrier bearing to get wobble and vibration out of the driveline which worked like a treat.

Later I replaced the AC-51 induction motor (and motor controller because they come as a set) with a larger more efficient permanent-magnet one. That was interesting—I got more power more torque and 30 to 40 percent more range. The upgraded motor was almost exactly the same size so I just pulled one out and plugged the other in. Easy.

There’s a wrecking yard near me that specializes in Teslas. They really know their stuff and they’ll walk you through the yard and you can pull parts out of crashed Teslas. Thanks to this yard I eventually upgraded the Morris to Tesla batteries which saved me 300 pounds and improved my total battery capacity.

The Morris now has 120 horsepower 175 lb-ft of torque and 147 eMPG or around 275 to 300 watt-hours per mile—that’s pretty similar in efficiency to a Tesla Model 3 although my little truck weighs about half as much. I’ve never driven it more than 90 miles because I just don’t go that far but its range is around 125 miles. I use my Morris every day. So far I’ve put 18000 miles on it.

My other vehicle is a Ram 2500 so with fuel prices where they are guess which one I’m going to drive?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vZWxlY3RyZWsuY28vMjAyMi8xMS8wNy90ZXNsYS1iYWNrZWQtc3RhcnR1cC16b2xhLW1pY3JvZ3JpZC1wb3dlcmluZy1hZnJpY2FuLXZpbGxhZ2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla-backed startup launches microgrid powering 2 African villages,"ZOLA Electric a Tesla-backed company providing energy to remote African villages through solar and batteries has announced the deployment of a new microgrid system that is powering 1000 homes schools and businesses in two villages in Rwanda.

We reported on ZOLA Electric back in 2015 when it was still called Off Grid Electric.

At the time it was a Tanzania-based startup offering solar power and energy storage as a service to rural regions of Africa.

It got on our radar when SolarCity led two early rounds of financing of $16 million and $25 million for the company alongside a Tesla investor DBL Partners and SolarCity’s CEO at the time Lyndon Rive joined the company’s board.

By acquiring SolarCity in 2016 Tesla will become a major shareholder of ZOLA Electric and it looks like Tesla hasn’t divested since the company still promotes itself as being “backed by Tesla.”

ZOLA’s approach is similar to Tesla Energy with Powerwalls and solar power but it utilizes much smaller battery packs and solar panel systems to reduce the cost of deployment and power impoverished communities.

This was the company’s original system:

It was enough to power some lights at night a radio and allow a family to charge some appliances and devices such as phones.

Over the last few years the company has managed to grow quite fast and now it has deployed battery systems and solar panels that power “over 1.5 million people and more than 300000 homes and businesses.”

Recently ZOLA has moved to a more robust and powerful system called INIFITY:

Today ZOLA announced that it has deployed its INFINITY system to power a new “mini grid” in two villages in Rwanda:

The groundbreaking mini-grid project installed in the agricultural villages of Gakagati I and II in Nyagatare Rwanda – the country’s largest and second most-populous district – will deliver clean affordable reliable power via ZOLA’s innovative INFINITY technology to over 1000 homes businesses schools and clinics.

The project was completed over 10 months and financed by Facebook the Shell Foundation USAID and Endev and supported by NXT Grid.

The system deployed in Gakagati has a 120 kW capacity but ZOLA says that it is modular and easy to expand. It expects to double the capacity to 240 kW over time.

Many villages that lack access to power or where it is unreliable and expensive have struggled to grow economically because of this. ZOLA believes that its solar and battery-powered microgrid approach allows access to power at a lower cost and it can gradually scale with communities as they learn to use the power to help lift themselves out of poverty.

Interestingly Tesla CEO Elon Musk predicted back in 2016 after Tesla launched its own battery and solar-powered energy division that some developing countries would skip the traditional grid altogether and go straight to microgrids:

The advantage of solar and batteries is that you can avoid building electricity plants at all. So you can be in a remote village and have solar panels that charge a battery pack that then supply power to the whole village without ever having to run thousands of miles of high-voltage cables all over the place. It’s like what happened with landline phones versus cellular phones. In a lot of developing countries they just didn’t do the landline phones. They went straight to cellular.

It appears that these two villages in Rwanda are an example of that."

Packaging—one of the final steps in semiconductor manufacturing—places chips in a protective case to prevent corrosion and to provide the interface that can combine and connect already made chips. To drive U.S. leadership in the $ 30.4 billion advanced semiconductor packaging market the CHIPS and Science Act signed into law in August 2022 calls on the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) to establish a National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program (NAPMP). This follows the June 2021 100-day supply chain review ordered by the Biden administration of the risk posed by U.S. reliance on China and Taiwan for semiconductor packaging processes. Understanding these developments requires a closer look at the landscape for assembly testing and packaging (ATP).



The ATP Landscape



Semiconductor Packaging is an extremely labor-intensive process. To take advantage of lower wages and input costs at least 81 percent of the world’s ATP production is located in Asia according to the Boston Consulting Group and the Semiconductor Industry Association. There are two prevailing business models in the ATP market: Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDM) provide all semiconductor packaging processes in-house while Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (OSAT) companies specialize in outsourced testing and assembly operations.



Currently U.S. semiconductor firms offshore nearly all packaging processes to OSAT companies or rely on IDM facilities owned by U.S. companies that are located overseas. For example Apple which has a major chip design operation in the U.S. has an estimated $44.95 billion deal with Taiwanese semiconductor company ASE for ATP processes. According to the Bloomberg Terminal database other U.S. semiconductor manufacturers including Intel Micron and OnSemiconductor also rely on major East Asian OSAT firms. In 2021 SEMI and Techsearch published a new edition of the Worldwide Assembly & Test Facility Database which found that there were 373 total OSATs facilities worldwide in 2021 most of which were located in Asia with 111 in China and 107 in Taiwan. Meanwhile only 46 facilities were located in the U.S.



Similarly for IDM facilities the U.S. is dependent on China Taiwan and other Asian countries. For example Texas Instruments one of the leading global IDM companies in the U.S. has zero test and assembly/development facilities in the U.S. and transports all semiconductors that it manufactures in the U.S. to companies outside the U.S. for packaging. Meanwhile Intel another leading global IDM company based in the U.S. has only one such facility. As a result Intel and Texas Instruments are 75 percent and 85 percent dependent on Asia respectively for ATP processes with each company conducting about 30 percent of its packaging in China and Taiwan. This heavy reliance on companies in Asia especially in China and Taiwan is a weakness in the U.S. supply chain.



Amid growing Chinese assertiveness in technology policy and the disruptions in chip supply associated with the COVID-19 pandemic a number of government and industry leaders are raising concerns about the exposure of the U.S. to supply disruptions in critical technologies. The NIST National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program represents a significant response to address this vulnerability.



Sustaining Moore’s Law



Packaging research is also seen as a way to remain on the cutting edge of semiconductor innovation. Historically semiconductor research has focused on increasing the number of components on a single chip (“chip density”) in order to innovate smaller higher performance and multifunctional semiconductors. Companies such as Intel TSMC and Samsung compete on commercializing smaller ever more advanced chips sustaining Moore’s Law. As the technology bumps against the laws of physics however the quest for smaller chips is expected to yield less and less impact in terms of efficiency gains.



Innovations in chip packaging can raise the performance of electronic devices as well as lower the power consumption of chips. A focus on driving innovations in advanced packaging rather than just chip density can help make the U.S. semiconductor industry more competitive.



The National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program



NAPMP is tasked with building a robust domestic advanced packaging capability in the U.S. The CHIPS and Science Act also known as CHIPS+ appropriates $11 billion over five years for research and development programs including an initial $2.5 billion for the establishment of the NAPMP.



Under the NAPMP NIST will bring together industry and academia to carry out shared research and innovation in high-performance space-saving and multi-functional packaging. This facility will provide companies with access to critical shared research infrastructure that will enable firms to test new advanced packaging approaches and processes and integrate them into their business models. This infrastructure would otherwise be too expensive and technologically difficult to install and operate independently. This effort is similar to those that Japan has been carrying out to boost its domestic semiconductor industry.



Future Steps



Although the U.S. government has approved a once-in-a-generation investment in advanced manufacturing NAPMP is only expected to be a first step. Additional policy action will be needed to ensure U.S. leadership in semiconductors. Among other actions the U.S. can:

Encourage U.S.-based Packaging: U.S. policymakers can encourage domestic and foreign semiconductor companies to establish new IDM and OSAT packaging facilities in the United States within the framework of the Semiconductor Financial Assistance Program (SFAP). The SFAP is a $39 billion subsidy program established in CHIPS+ to expand semiconductor manufacturing research packaging equipment and materials capabilities in the U.S.

For example Intel and Foxconn Technology Group have relocated their manufacturing facilities from China to countries like India Malaysia and Vietnam.

Maintain Long-term Support from the Public: The U.S. government must manage the public’s short-term expectations as well as win long-term support from the public for the NAPMP.

Semiconductor packaging has been outsourced and cultivated abroad in China Taiwan and other East Asian countries in the past decades. However emerging national security concerns and technological innovations in semiconductor packaging have led to a reevaluation of the global semiconductor supply chain and the importance of innovations in semiconductor packaging for maintaining further improvements in semiconductors. The National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program along with complementary initiatives can help secure U.S. leadership in semiconductor research and production.

Given the wealth of topics relevant to embedded systems how much emphasis should I place on assembly language?

A single 15-week semester isn’t long enough to accommodate a complete treatment of all relevant topics on the subject of embedded systems. In developing the curriculum for my course I have tried to prioritize the practice of marketable skills (to some extent) but a university course should also provide more depth than a tech boot camp. Nevertheless every time we progress to the unit of the course where we revert for a few weeks from C language to assembly language I approach Google and ask:

“Should I learn assembly language for embedded software development?”

In this article I'll try to objectively support or refute the typical answers to this question that are found on software development forums and other web outlets. Ultimately my aim is to help you the reader decide whether or not your specific situation warrants learning or teaching how to program in assembly language.

Does Assembly Language Make Debugging Software Easier?

This is theoretically true; however the debugging advantage afforded by knowing assembly language rarely materializes in practice. Many microcontroller development boards are equipped with in-circuit debuggers (Figure 1) allowing the developer to set breakpoints pause execution and run their code line-by-line in their integrated development environment (IDE).

Figure 1. Like many other development boards the MSP-EXP432P4111 LaunchPad from Texas Instruments (TI) includes an in-circuit debugger.

When the execution is paused the debugger also allows the user to peek at the contents of the central processing unit (CPU) and peripheral registers for the microcontroller.

The line-by-line execution of code almost always maps to lines in the user’s C code. Though technically a proxy for line-by-line execution of machine code this allows a developer to sift through their software in search of runtime bugs without ever having to actually look at and interpret the compiler-generated assembly code (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Line-by-line execution of C code in TI Code Composer Studio [click to enlarge].

Despite that there are certainly cases where a runtime bug has led me to look in the disassembly view of my code (where the IDE maps assembler mnemonics to machine code); however those instances are extremely infrequent. Furthermore I can’t remember a time when I looked at the disassembly view and discovered my bug through that process; more often I discover my error in plain view in my C code after walking away to get coffee and then coming back. My conclusion from personal experience is that the power of assembly language knowledge in debugging embedded software is significantly diminished by the effectiveness of line-by-line in-circuit debugging in C code (Figure 3).

Figure 3. Line-by-line execution of assembly code in disassembly view in TI Code Composer Studio [click to enlarge]

Is Assembly Language Needed For Embedded Development Jobs?

Annually IEEE Spectrum releases survey results showing the most popular programming languages for that year. This year 2022 when listed according to job postings assembly language ranked 30th on the list (behind even Cobol!) while C and C++ ranked 6th and 7th respectively. These rankings are across all industries so it’s no surprise that C/C++ should rank so highly and assembly so low. However sifting through job postings in the realm of embedded software and IoT (Internet-of-Things) device development confirms that C experience is more often listed as a required skill than assembly language.

Despite its lower skill ranking in recent job postings it can often depend on the specific career path you choose. For example in offensive and defensive cyberwarfare assembly language or code can help boost your resume. In an accompanying article to those IEEE Spectrum survey results it is mentioned that many job listings in cybersecurity and cyberwarfare call for assembly language experience.

This implies that there are careers where assembly language programming is an important skill; though those jobs may not be in embedded systems development. Another web search for jobs in compiler engineering and design however reveals an industry where assembly language experience is a must. Novel architectures are being developed every year for specialized purposes such as rendering video running neural networks and edge computing. Developers are being hired to write efficient compilers targeted to these architectures and applications.

Furthermore there are several communities of developers working on open-source compiler tools (ex. Gnu Compiler Collection or the LLVM Project). Assembly experience is required to make meaningful contributions to those projects too. So if you are interested in pursuing that type of work then learning to program in assembly language is not only a good idea it’s mandatory. However if you want to get a job in embedded software development the benefit of learning assembly is more nuanced. You might be better off honing your C skills.

Are Programs Written in Assembly Language Faster and Smaller Than C?

For this answer to carry weight we must be designing a system with speed or space constraints that are so great that we would sacrifice development time code portability and code maintainability to meet them. That is rarely the case. Manufacturers sell devices now with abundant program memory and processors are so speedy they can run a Python interpreter right on board. Some of these issues can be addressed using assembly language in embedded development and are most easily solved in the device selection stage of hardware design. In other words if your compiled C code isn’t going to fit or run fast enough use a bigger or faster device.

Moreover it’s only partly true that assembly programs are faster than those compiled from C. Compilers are not as inherently inefficient as they once were because it’s in the best interest of the companies creating the compilers—often the chip manufacturers themselves—to distribute the most efficient tool possible. If your compiled code is slow the bottom line suffers. While it’s possible for a programmer to know little tricks to shave off clock cycles in assembly language the compiler knows many of its own tricks and it never forgets to use them. Therefore even though there are specific cases where writing directly in assembly language produces faster programs than compiled C the size and speed of available hardware combined with the development tools can nullify these benefits of writing embedded software in assembly language.

Assembly Language Teaches You About Past Microprocessor Programming

Often to know where the future of electronic design is heading it's necessary to understand the past. In this case understanding how microprocessors were programmed in the past can be compelling since I am nostalgic by nature. Plus I love learning about the history of computing and electronics. However if a hands-on history lesson is a goal writing assembly code for an Atmega328P or the ARM core in a Raspberry Pi won’t be nearly as satisfying or authentic as learning to write code for say the MOS 6502 (which you can do here). An example device using the MOS 6502 is the Commodore 64 shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4. Commodore 64 is one of the many devices powered by the MOS 6502 microprocessor. Image used courtesy of Evan-Amos on Wikimedia Commons

Of course if you really want to write assembly for your Raspberry Pi there are books for that too (see Raspberry Pi Assembly Language Programming: ARM Processor Coding by Stephen Smith for example). Learning to program in assembly language for the joy of the experience is a great reason but programming in assembly language is not common practice in modern embedded software development. And this does not make a compelling reason for an instructor to include assembly language programming in their curriculumn.

Assembly Language Helps Programmers Understand Processors

Finally the most compelling reason to me for learning assembly language is because it allows a programmer to better understand what the processor is actually doing at the lowest level. In my course I prioritize depth of coverage over quantity of marketable skills. If you want to know what is really going on at every step of execution learning assembly language is the best way to achieve that goal.

Assembly knowledge also allows you to explore what your compiler does to convert high-level conditional statements and loops in C to machine code. As much grumbling as I witness from students in the process I know they are gaining a unique understanding of the execution of code that they can only achieve by programming in assembly.

Conclusion—There is No One-size-fits-all Answer

This article gives a fairly comprehensive survey of the reasons given online for learning assembly language each with its own merits. However when deciding whether or not to learn or teach assembly language each person’s specific context and goals matter. Someone looking to add marketable skills to their resume might be better served by practicing C development for a different microcontroller than they are used to. Another person might be genuinely curious about the topic and therefore motivated to learn something new. There is no harm in that!

I decided to teach assembly language for a few weeks in my embedded systems course because I want students to better understand what a computing device actually does and how that differs from their assumptions based on the code they have written in C. In any case if you are asking whether or not you should learn assembly language your own goals and motivations should guide you as you evaluate whether the answers you find are relevant to your decision.

It's a scary thought right. Giant balls of fire in the distance mushroom clouds radiation spread throughout miles. The effects would be devastating for the Texas Panhandle if this were to happen. Well according to reports by The United States Department of Energy and The Project on Government Oversight (POGO) done in 2006 this could of happened.

Credit: C-SPAN Credit: C-SPAN loading...

In March of 2005 Pantex disassembly teams were working on a W-56 warhead; a bomb with explosive power 100 times that of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. According to an independent investigation done by POGO technicians working over 70 hour work weeks had used a faulty tool on the warhead putting far too much pressure on the warhead than what is safe. This almost caused the warhead to explode.

Some time before this incident an anonymous complaint letter was sent to BWX Technologies Inc. who worked under contract with the Department of Energy. The complaint detailed engineers having to work over 70 hour work weeks in order to meet tight decommissioning schedules and characterized the need for renovations and repairs in some areas. The Department of Energy shortly after began an investigation which resulted in Pantex receiving a $110000 fine.

Although both of these troubling stories about Pantex emerged within a relatively short period of time the Department of Energy stated that it had ""confidence that Pantex will continue its outstanding work while keeping stringent safety and security policies in place."" Some time after this the fine was levied and Pantex resumed to normal operations. In later letters sent to the Department of Energy POGO complained about the ""laxity"" of the investigations conducted.

Although this happened 17 years ago it is scary to think that Pantex and parts of the Panhandle could of been wiped off the map. This incident thankfully did not end horribly but it remained unknown to the public until the Department of Energy's investigation which did not give Pantex much punishment for its laxity in this situation. Hopefully in all the years leading up to now safety procedures are much better than they were in the situation leading up to this incident. The fate of Amarillo quite literally lies in it.

The University of Texas at Austin has joined leading scientists on a bold new effort to understand Earth’s largest earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.

The plans were detailed in a new report published Nov. 7 with the backing of 55 universities.

Demian Saffer the director of the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics (UTIG) and one of the report’s many architects said the initiative marked the start of a long-term multinational effort to make hazard forecasting a reality at subduction zones where the collision of tectonic plates increase the risk of earthquakes and other extreme seismic hazards.

“Our report [published today] shapes the future of fundamental science that underpins hazards posed by earthquakes volcanoes and landslides through a major multi-decadal scale program to address these grand challenges” he said.

Named Subduction Zones in Four Dimensions (SZ4D) the initiative seeks to install massive arrays of undersea instruments aimed directly at earthquake hotspots in Chile Alaska and the Pacific Northwest. Data from the instruments will give scientists a never-before-seen picture of Earth’s inner workings and help scientists create a new generation of predictive computer models.

Earthquakes tsunamis and volcanic eruptions have caused catastrophic devastation throughout human history. Despite their potential to disrupt society the science behind where and when they occur remains a mystery. The new report details scientific research priorities that can help solve the mystery beginning with large-scale instrumentation at subduction zones in Chile and the U.S.

According to Emily Brodsky a professor of Earth and planetary sciences at the University of California Santa Cruz and chair of the SZ4D steering committee the Chilean subduction zone is the primary target because it is the most geologically active of the three earthquake hotspots. The report recommends deploying instruments at all three sites but most of the efforts are planned for Chile which will host 70% of the instrumentation.

“We want to be able to translate what we learn in Chile to Cascadia and Alaska” Brodsky said.

The SZ4D initiative has already begun building partnerships with Chilean scientists and international groups studying the subduction zone there.

In addition to instrument arrays the report calls for researchers to study the sites’ geologic background conduct laboratory experiments and build computational models that integrate field observations and laboratory data.

According to Thorsten Becker a professor at UT Austin’s Jackson School of Geosciences major scientific advances in understanding subduction zone hazards could yield tangible benefits for communities in the affected regions. This includes possible forecasts of large earthquakes volcanic eruptions and landslides.

“We may never know exactly when the next big earthquake or eruption will happen but the more we learn about these systems the closer we can get to building physics-based models that can quantify the degree to which these events are inherently predictable” said Becker who led the planning for SZ4D’s computational modeling component (the Modeling Collaboratory for Subduction) over the past two years.

Through the efforts of Becker Saffer and a growing number of researchers and students at the Jackson School and its UTIG research unit UT Austin is poised to play a key role in shaping the SZ4D initiative and the future of earthquake research.

The SZ4D initiative is organized into three working groups: Landscapes and Seascapes Faulting and Earthquake Cycles and Magmatic Drivers of Eruption. It also has two integrative groups: Building Equity and Capacity in Geoscience and Modeling Collaboratory for Subduction. The initiative includes 74 people from 55 universities and institutions. The next SZ4D community meeting will be held November 14 -16 in Houston.

On a hot Monday in late August 2021 Marcos Zárate was starting his second week as the lead director of the mariachi program at Rio Grande City High School in Texas. In his practice room 17 students in jeans and school T-shirts stood in a half-circle playing songs from memory. Dozens of trophies lined one wall and across another someone had hung a cheery hand-painted banner spelling out the team’s name “Mariachi Cascabel.” The pandemic had kept the young musicians home the past 18 months and now fresh out of lockdown they were eager to play as a group again — to feel the adrenaline rush and transformation that came with being on a stage.

Dressed all in black his thick hair gelled back Zárate who was 40 paced the room listening intently. “Stop!” he said as the students tore through a huapango called “A la Luz de los Cocuyos.” There were problems.

“Those trills they need to come out a lot stronger than that. Careful at the beginning — ta ta ta ta ta — I want to hear all the notes together at the same volume. I don’t want to hear ta ta TA ta TA ta TA. Very defined. OK? From the top!”

They began again playing the same songs over and over. Zárate bounded among them singing along to their instrument parts. When he ran out of ways to explain something in English he did it in Spanish which all of his students understood. “If you want to be competitive especially in this part of the Valley you have to be super detailed” he told me. “That’s what gives mariachi music the style all those little details we were going through. That’s the beauty of mariachi.”"

Molecular cloning

Bacterial strains

Chemically competent Escherichia coli cells (NEB Stable) were used for the transformation with plasmid DNA. Carbenicillin (Carl Roth) was used at a final concentration of 100 µg ml−1 for antibiotic selection. All bacterial cells were grown in lysogeny broth medium or agar plates including the respective antibiotics.

Bacterial transformation

Chemical transformations were performed by adding 1–3 µl DNA from Gibson Assembly or ligation reaction to thawed ice-cold chemically competent cells (50 µl). After incubation on ice for 30 min heat shock was performed at 42 °C for 30 s followed by a 5-min incubation step on ice before finally adding 450 µl of room temperature SOC Medium (NEB). Cells were then plated on agar plates containing the appropriate types and concentrations of antibiotics and were incubated overnight at 37 °C.

DNA agarose gel electrophoresis

DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis at 110 V for 30–50 min on a TAE-buffered 1% (wt/vol) agarose gel (Agarose Standard; Carl Roth) with 1:10000 SYBR Safe stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Before loading samples were mixed with Gel Loading Dye (Purple 6X; NEB). Plus DNA Ladder (1 kb; NEB) was loaded in parallel for size determination.

DNA digestion with restriction endonucleases

Plasmid DNA was digested with restriction enzymes (NEB) according to the manufacturer’s protocol in a reaction volume of 40–50 μl containing 1–3 μg plasmid DNA. Digested plasmid DNA fragments were separated by size via agarose gel electrophoresis and subsequently purified using a Monarch DNA Gel Extraction Kit (NEB).

Gibson assembly and ligation reactions

Concentrations of DNA fragments were measured with a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop 1000; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Ligations were performed with 30–100 ng plasmid backbone DNA (an ori-containing DNA fragment) in a 20 µl reaction volume at room temperature with 1:1–3 backbone:insert molar ratios using T4 DNA Ligase (Quick Ligation Kit; NEB) for 5–10 min. Isothermal Gibson assemblies were performed in a 15 µl reaction volume with 1:1–1:5 backbone:insert molar ratios and 50–75 ng backbone DNA using NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (2×; NEB) for 20–60 min at 50 °C.

PCR

Oligodeoxyribonucleotides (single-stranded DNA primer; IDT) were resolubilized in nuclease-free water to 100 µM. PCR amplification from plasmid or genomic DNA was performed with Platinum SuperFi II PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix or 5× High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase and 5× GC Enhancer (NEB) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After PCR samples were gel purified from gel electrophoresis using a Monarch DNA Gel Extraction Kit (NEB).

For downstream T7 Endonuclease I assays PCR was performed using LongAmp Hot Start Taq 2X Master Mix (NEB). Primers are listed in Supplementary Table 2.

Plasmid DNA purification and Sanger sequencing

Transformed E. coli clones were picked from agar plates using sterile pipette tips inoculated in 2 ml SOC Medium with appropriate antibiotics in a ventilated falcon tube and incubated at 37 °C for 6–8 h. For sequencing or molecular cloning plasmid DNA was extracted using the Monarch Plasmid Miniprep Kit (NEB) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Correct clones were inoculated in 100 ml lysogeny broth medium containing proper antibiotics overnight at 37 °C. Plasmid DNA was purified with a Plasmid Maxi Kit (QIAGEN).

Plasmid DNA was sent for Sanger sequencing (GENEWIZ) and analysed by Geneious Prime (Biomatters) sequence alignments.

Mammalian cell culture

Cell lines and cultivation

Cells were cultured at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 and saturated H 2 O.

HEK293T cells (ECACC 12022001; Sigma–Aldrich) were cultured in advanced Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing 10% foetal bovine serum (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific) GlutaMAX (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific) 100 µg ml−1 Penicillin–Streptomycin (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific) 10 µg ml−1 Piperacillin (Sigma–Aldrich) and 10 µg ml−1 Ciprofloxacin (Sigma–Aldrich). Cells were split at 90% confluence by medium removal a washing step with Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS; Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and cell detachment for 5–10 min with room temperature Accutase solution (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Accutase was subsequently inactivated by adding a 300% excess of pre-warmed culture medium. Cells were then transferred into a new T25/T75 flask at an appropriate density or counted and plated in a 96- or 6-well format for plasmid transfection.

Jurkat E6.1 cells (ECACC 88042803) were maintained in RPMI 1640 media containing glutamine (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 100 µg ml−1 Penicillin–Streptomycin (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The cells were passaged at a density of ~900000 cells per ml−1 by removing 90% of the cell suspension and adding pre-warmed RPMI 1640 media.

Human embryonic stem cells (H9; WiCell Research Institute) were routinely cultured in StemMACS iPS-Brew XF (Miltenyi Biotec) and passaged using StemMACS Passaging Solution (Miltenyi Biotec) on tissue culture-treated plates (Sigma–Aldrich) coated with Matrigel (Thermo Fisher Scientific) diluted 1:100 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium/F-12 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Activation of IL-2 expression in Jurkat E6.1 cells

A total of 500000 cells were centrifuged (3 min; 300 RCF) and resuspended in 2 ml RPMI media supplemented with 1 ng ml−1 PMA and 1 µg ml−1 PHA if not otherwise indicated. Induction stress could be reduced by using 0.5 ng ml−1 PMA and 0.5 µg ml−1 PHA. The NFAT response could be accelerated by adding 0.1 µM calcium ionophore (Br)-A23187 leading to rapid IL2 expression.

Cell fractionation

For separation of the cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA cells were fractionated. After removal of the cultivation media cells were rinsed with DPBS (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated in Accutase solution (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 10 min. The detached cells were collected from the T25 flask (1000000 cells were seeded 24 h before collection) and centrifuged for 3 min at 300 RCF and 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in 750 µl DPBS (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and centrifuged again (300 RCF at 4 °C). All further manipulations with the samples were performed on ice. Cell pellets were resuspended in 750 µl ice-cold mild lysis buffer (50 mM Tris 100 mM NaCl 5 mM MgCl 2 and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 pH 8) and incubated for 5 min to allow lysis of the cell membrane only.

The lysate was centrifuged for 2 min (18000 RCF at 4 °C) and the supernatant was carefully transferred to the fresh single-packaged Eppendorf reaction tube. The pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 750 µl mild lysis buffer. Subsequently 1.5 µl proteinase K (20 mg ml−1; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 4 µl 40% sodium dodecyl sulfate solution were added to both fractions which were vortexed vigorously before incubation for 15 min at 37 °C.

Finally the fractions were centrifuged at 18000 RCF for 2 min to clear impurities from the samples. RNA isolation was carried out as described in the RNA analysis section using the NEB Monarch Total RNA Miniprep Kit according to the protocol.

Differentiation of H9 embryonic stem cells

Wild-type H9 stem cells and H9 stem cells carrying the INSPECT reporter system at the NEAT1 locus (INSPECT NEAT1_v2:SigP–NLuc ) were differentiated into ectoderm mesoderm and endoderm using the STEMdiff Trilineage Differentiation Kit (Stem Cell Technologies) on 24-well plates according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For the differentiation into each lineage 12 wells were seeded allowing sampling of the supernatant and RNA purification in triplicates for each time point. Samples were analysed after 0 2 3 and 5 d for mesoderm and endoderm or 7 d for ectoderm. Each day 55 μl supernatant was sampled for bioluminescence quantification. Additionally after each measurement cells were counted with a Countess 3 Automated Cell Counter (Invitrogen) for normalization of the luminescence signals. Subsequently RNA was isolated for RT-qPCR analysis of NEAT1 levels lineage markers and Yamanaka factors.

Gene expression manipulation with CRISPR–Cas9 (CRISPRi)

Gene expression of NEAT1 or GUARDIN was transcriptionally repressed in HEK293T cells by co-transfecting a CAG-driven catalytically inactive version of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (D10A and H840A) with N- and C-terminal SV40 nuclear localization signals fused to the KRAB domain of ZIM3 and a plasmid mixture expressing three (NEAT1) or two (GUARDIN) human U6 promoter-driven sgRNAs (20-nucleotide spacer) targeting the TSS of NEAT1 or GUARDIN. An sgRNA mixture targeting the unrelated MAPT locus was co-transfected as a non-targeting control.

Gene expression was followed at 48 h post-transfection (medium change) for several hours by NLuc assay of the supernatant.

Generation of stable cell lines carrying the INSPECT reporter system via CRISPR–Cas9

We used plasmids expressing a mammalian codon-optimized S. pyogenes Cas9 (SpyCas9) with two C-terminal SV40 nuclear localization signals (CBh promoter driven) and a human U6 promoter-driven sgRNA with a 19- to 21-bp spacer for genome targeting to generate stable INSPECT HEK293T Jurkat E6.1 or H9 hESC lines (Extended Data Fig. 8). The insertion sites were chosen using the consensus NAG^GWW (where ‘^’ indicates the insertion site). This insertion site leads to a functional splice donor and splice acceptor sequence in combination with the inserted INSPECT construct.

The efficiency of an sgRNA for a specific target site was tested by T7 endonuclease I assay (NEB) according to the manufacturer’s protocol after 72 h post-transfection of cells with plasmids encoding Cas9 and the targeting sgRNA.

Optionally for knock-in an i53 expression plasmid (a genetically encoded 53BP1 inhibitor)55 was co-transfected in addition to the CRISPR–Cas9 plasmid to enhance homologous recombination.

In addition to the genetically encoded inhibition the non-homologous end-joining pathway was blocked selectively by the DNA-dependent protein kinase inhibitor AZD7648 (ref. 56). The medium was supplemented with 0.5 µM AZD7648 (HY-111783; MedChemExpress) 3 h before transfection.

The INSPECT donor DNA plasmid contains homology arms of at least 800 bp flanking the reporter construct. It also contains a selection cassette to select for cells undergoing successful Cas9-mediated homologous recombination (Extended Data Fig. 9).

After knock-in cells undergo selection counterselection and monoclonalization. We assume an overall time of 8 weeks to generate monoclonal INSPECT cell lines (Extended Data Fig. 10).

HEK293T and H9 selection

Three days post-transfection (6-well format) the medium was supplemented with puromycin (10 µg ml−1 for HEK293T cells; 0.5 µg ml−1 for H9 cells). Cells were observed daily and detached with Accutase when surviving colonies reached a colony size of ~50 cells. After puromycin selection the EEF1A promoter-driven selection cassette was removed from the genome by three sequential transient expressions of CAG-driven Flp recombinase. Cells underwent counterselection with 2 µM ganciclovir (GCV) for 2 weeks.

Next cells were monoclonalized by limited dilution into 96-well plates (culture media supplemented with 2 µM GCV for counterselection). Besides puromycin-N-acetyltransferase the selection cassette encodes the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase which phosphorylates the prodrug GCV. The phosphorylated GCV is an analogue of guanosine nucleoside and terminates the elongation of DNA strands resulting in cell death57.

Cells were cultured until the colony size was big enough to expand over 48-well plates. After reaching confluence half of the cell mass was used to isolate genomic DNA using a Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega). Genotyping of the genomic DNA was performed using Platinum SuperFi II PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or LongAmp Hot Start Taq 2X Master Mix (NEB) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Primer sequences and corresponding polymerase usage are indicated in Supplementary Table 2. The PCR products from clones where the genotyping indicates homozygosity were sent for Sanger sequencing to verify their sequence integrity. Genotyping results are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2.

Jurkat E6.1 selection

Three days post-nucleofection (12-well format) the medium was replaced with medium containing puromycin (2 µg ml−1). Cells were observed daily and singularized by pipetting. This step was repeated until no substantial puromycin-mediated cell death could be observed. After selection the EEF1A-driven selection cassette was removed from the genome by three sequential transient expressions of CMV promoter-driven Flp recombinase. Cells then underwent counterselection with 2 µM GCV for 2 weeks. Next cells were monoclonalized by limited dilution into 96-well plates.

Generation of NEAT1 KO cell lines by activating the Cre recombinase-inducible KO switch

Cells carrying the INSPECT construct underwent three transient transfections of plasmid-encoded Cre recombinase. Upon Cre expression the inverted polyA sequence together with an inverted upstream splice acceptor was flipped irreversibly into its sense direction to induce an irreversible KO of the endogenous gene by transcription termination (Extended Data Fig. 6).

Induction of TRE3G-driven transcription

For transient transfection experiments with TRE3G promoter-driven constructs or stable cell lines containing a TRE3G promoter-driven sequence the indicated amount of Dox was added to each well 16 h after transfection.

Plasmid nucleofection

Jurkat E6.1

For nucleofection 1000000 Jurkat E6.1 cells were centrifuged (90 RCF for 10 min) and resuspended in 100 µl Amaxa Cell Line Nucleofector Kit V (Lonza) Nucleofector solution according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The cell suspension was supplemented with 1 µg plasmid DNA and immediately transferred into cuvettes for electroporation. The Nucleofector program CL-120 of the 4D-Nucleofector (Lonza) was applied. After adding 500 µl pre-warmed RPMI media cells were transferred carefully into a 12-well plate (2 ml final volume).

H9

A total of 1000000 H9 cells were detached and underwent nucleofection with the P3 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector X Kit (Lonza) using the CB-156 program of the 4D-Nucleofector (Lonza).

Plasmid transfection

HEK293T cells were transfected either with X-tremeGENE HP (Roche) or jetOPTIMUS DNA transfection reagent (Polyplus) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Total DNA amounts were kept constant across all samples in all transient experiments to yield comparable complex formation and thus reproducible results. For 96-well plates 100 ng plasmid DNA was used whereas for 6-well plates 2.4 µg plasmid DNA was used per well. Cells were plated the day before transfection (25000 cells per well in 200 µl for 96-well plates or 600000 cells per well in 3 ml for 6-well plates).

Viability/cytotoxicity assay

HEK293T cells were seeded in a 96-well format (25000 cells per well in 200 µl cultivation media). After 24 h cells were transfected with plasmid DNA coding for mouse Pgk1 promoter-driven HIV-1 gag and Pgk1 promoter-driven Gag–PCP together with PP7-tagged INSPECT or control plasmid to mimic the cellular stress of transfection and transgene expression. After 48 h cells were treated with the viability/cytotoxicity reagent (ApoTox-Glo Triplex Assay; Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Signals were obtained at 505 nm (viability) and 520 nm (cytotoxicity) using a Varioskan LUX microplate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

A sandwich ELISA was performed to detect the secreted human IL-2 in supernatants of Jurkat E6.1 cells. The monoclonal IL-2 detection antibody (clone MQ1-17H12; rat isotype; 14-7029-81; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was diluted to 5 µg ml−1 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and immobilized on a 96-well plate (Nunc-Immuno; Merck) overnight at 4 °C (100 µl per well). After one washing step (all washing steps were performed with 250 µl DPBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20) the wells were incubated for 1 h with blocking buffer (2% Bovine Serum Albumin Fraction V (Sigma–Aldrich) in DPBS). After five washing steps 100 µl supernatants recombinant IL-2 control (diluted in PBS; PHC0023; Thermo Fisher Scientific) or RPMI media control were incubated for 1 h with gentle shaking. After five washing steps 2 µg ml−1 of the biotinylated polyclonal IL-2 detection antibody (diluted in blocking buffer; rabbit isotype; 13-7028-85; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was incubated for 2 h with gentle shaking (100 µl per well). Following another five washing steps 100 µl of a 1:4500 dilution of a streptavidin–horseradish peroxidase conjugate (N100; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to each well. After 30 min of gentle shaking wells were washed five more times. For substrate solution 100 mM 33′55′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma–Aldrich) in DMSO was diluted 1:1000 in 50 mM phosphate citrate buffer then 30% hydrogen peroxide (Sigma–Aldrich) was added 1:5000. The reaction was stopped using 1 M nitric acid. The 33′55′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate intensity was measured at 450 nm using a Varioskan LUX microplate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

RNA analysis

RNA smFISH

HEK293T cells were seeded (300000 cells per well) 24 h before fixation in 2-well μ-Slides (Ibidi). After three washing steps with DPBS (Gibco) cells were fixed for 10 min at room temperature using 10% neutral buffered formalin (Sigma–Aldrich). Following three additional washing steps with DPBS the fixed cells were permeabilized in 70% ethanol overnight at 4 °C. After another three washing steps the samples were incubated in a prehybridization buffer containing 2× saline sodium citrate solution and 10% deionized formamide (Merck) for 15 min. Subsequently 50 μl hybridization buffer consisting of 50 μg competitor tRNA from E. coli (Roche) 10% dextran sulfate (VWR) 2 mg ml−1 UltraPure BSA (Thermo Fisher Scientific) 10 mM ribonucleoside vanadyl complex (NEB) and 0.125 µM Stellaris FISH Probes Human NEAT1 5′ Segment with Quasar 570 Dye (LGC; Biosearch Technologies) was added. The multiplicity of probes on a single RNA molecule increases the signal-to-noise ratio. The samples were sealed with parafilm and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified chamber for 6 h. The exposure to light was kept at a minimum to avoid photobleaching. After removing the parafilm samples were incubated twice with prehybridization buffer for 15 min at 37 °C followed by the last washing step with DPBS. Finally 10 μl ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a cover slide for imaging were added. Fluorescence microscopy was performed with a Zeiss microscope (Axiovert 200M; Carl Zeiss Microscopy) using the 63× oil immersion objective.

Isolation of RNA from cell lysates

RNA extraction was performed using the Monarch Total RNA Miniprep Kit (NEB) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was stored at −80 °C.

Isolation of RNA from virus-like particle-containing supernatant

At 48 h post-transfection 130 μl supernatant per well from 96-well transfection experiments was transferred to a 96-well PCR plate and centrifuged at 500 RCF for 10 min. Subsequently 100 μl was carefully removed and processed with the QiaAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was stored at −80 °C.

RT-qPCR

RNA samples were subjected to DNAse digestion with DNAse I (NEB) with the following protocol changes: the DNAse concentration was doubled and the incubation regimen was extended to 30 min interspersed with short mixing steps followed by inactivation at 75 °C for 15 min. For RT-qPCR reactions TaqMan probes (FAM + BHQ1) and primers were ordered from IDT. The Luna Cell Ready Probe One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (NEB) was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Reactions were run in 384-well plates (10 μl per well) in technical duplicates. Control amplification reactions without reverse transcriptase were carried out as a reference for each RT-qPCR run. The reactions were performed and monitored in an Applied Biosystems QuantStudioTM 12K Flex Real-Time PCR system. Primer and probe sequences are provided in Supplementary Table 2.

Semi-quantitative RT-PCR

Cells were collected for 5 min at 200 RCF after cell detachment using Accutase solution (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Reverse transcription was performed using the SuperScript IV VILO Master Mix (Invitrogen Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol with an extended incubation time (30 min at 50 °C) followed by a semi-quantitative PCR using LongAmp Hot Start Taq 2X Master Mix (NEB) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Primers were designed to amplify the full-length mRNA (IL2 and GUARDIN). For long transcripts >20 kb (NEAT1) primers flank the INSPECT insertion site. The elongation time was adjusted to allow amplification of RNA splicing isoforms which contain INSPECT.

Fluorescence/bioluminescence detection and gamma counting

Bioluminescence microscopy

Bioluminescence microscopy images were obtained with an LV200 bioluminescence life-imaging system (Olympus) in 8-well Grid-500 µ-Slides (Ibidi). HEK293T cells were plated (51000 cells per well) 24 h before imaging. For correlative bioluminescence imaging–smFISH analysis the furimazine stock solution (Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay System; Promega) was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol in a 1:100 final dilution but without the provided lysis buffer. After imaging the cells were quickly fixed for smFISH (see RNA smFISH section).

Jurkat E6.1 cells (220000 cells per well) were induced with 1 ng ml−1 PMA 1 µg ml−1 PHA and 0.1 µM A23187 and subsequently imaged for 10 h at 37 °C. The RPMI media was supplemented with 20 mM HEPES Nano-Glo Endurazine Live Cell Substrate (Promega) and Extracellular NanoLuc Inhibitor (Intracellular TE Nano-Glo Substrate/Inhibitor; Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Bioluminescence quantification

For bulk quantifications of cell bioluminescence cells were plated and transfected in 96-well format. For bioluminescence detection of secreted NLuc the supernatant was sampled (80 µl) at the indicated time points and detected using the Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) on the Centro LB 960 (Berthold Technologies) plate reader with 0.5-s acquisition time. For dual-luciferase readout using the Nano-Glo Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) NLuc and FLuc signals were read out on-plate 48 h post-transfection. Signals were obtained with 0.5-s acquisition time 10 min after adding reagent 1 (ONE-Glo EX Luciferase) for FLuc and 10 min after adding reagent 2 (NanoDLR Stop & Glo) for NLuc. Reagent 2 includes FLuc inhibitor. The relative luminescence units (RLU) of FLuc and NLuc are expressed relative to the signals obtained by INSPECT control  defined as 1 to make the y axis range consistent across experiments.

Epifluorescence microscopy

Epifluorescence microscopy images were taken on an EVOS FL Auto Imaging System (Invitrogen Thermo Fisher Scientific) with identical settings across all samples.

Fluorescence flow cytometry analysis

Adherent cells from 48-well plate transfections were dissociated with 200 µl Accutase and centrifuged at 200 RCF for 5 min at room temperature. Cell pellets were resuspended in ice-cold 500 µl DPBS containing 0.4% paraformaldehyde washed with DPBS resuspended transferred into conical 5 ml polystyrene round-bottom tubes including a cell-strainer cap and kept on ice. In fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) the main cell population was gated according to forward scatter and sideward scatter (Supplementary Fig. 3). Next single cells were chosen according to their FSC-A and FSC-W values. Subsequently the transfected cells were gated according to their green fluorescence (530 nm) or red fluorescence (586 nm). These gates were kept constant for all subsequent experimental conditions.

γ-scintillator measurements

Jurkat E6.1 cells carrying the INSPECT NIS reporter system homozygously in their genome (500000 cells in 1 ml RPMI media per well) were activated for IL2 expression. Analysis of intracellularly accumulated 131I– was performed 16 h post-induction. Each well was incubated with 100 kBq freshly calibrated 131I– in PBS for 2 h at 37 °C. After rinsing the wells three times with 10 ml PBS cells were lysed in 1 ml 0.5 M NaOH. The radiation intensity was analysed 1 day later with a γ-scintillator (Wizard2 1-Detector Gamma Counter; PerkinElmer) for 1 min resulting in an output of counts per minute.

Software

Image analysis

Image analysis was performed with Fiji with the BioVoxxel toolbox plugin58. Each image stack obtained from smFISH microscopy resulted in 21 layers of every channel which were z-projected using maximum intensity projection. An ImageJ macro was created for automated feature recognition and counting. All images were analysed with the same settings. Only the variable prominence was adjusted for each batch.

For visualization of smFISH images images underwent convoluted background subtraction (mean) with a radius of (100 pixels for Fig. 6c; 40 pixels for Fig. 6j). Images were linearly contrast enhanced only for visualization purposes (same settings for all images).

Images obtained by epifluorescence microscopy were analysed by segmenting the cells on the corresponding brightfield image and calculating the arithmetic mean of the fluorescence intensities per cell.

Images obtained from bioluminescence microscopy after IL-2 induction of Jurkat E6.1 INSPECT IL2:SigP–NLuc were analysed by randomly chosen ROIs from cells that showed responsiveness in the last frame and were manually analysed in Fiji using the mean bioluminescence imaging intensity of each ROI at the indicated time points.

Splice site predictions

Splice site predictions were conducted using NetGene2 (ref. 59).

RT-qPCR analysis

The acquired data were processed and exported using QuantStudio 12K Flex software. For some RT-qPCR traces individual baseline correction was performed.

Design considerations for INSPECT constructs

The constructs and all plasmids used in this work were codon optimized for mammalian cell expression. Large gene fragments (gBlocks) and oligodeoxynucleotides were obtained from IDT. INSPECT features modular construction. We chose the exonic splice consensus sequence NAG^GWW for CRISPR–Cas9-mediated INSPECT insertion. The resulting flanking exonic sequences should have a minimum length of 30 bp to ensure precise splicing. For coding genes INSPECT should not be introduced more than 50 bp downstream of the host CDS to avoid nonsense-mediated decay60. For lncRNAs only restraints on the minimum exon size apply. Splice prediction software should further evaluate the chosen splice sites (for example NetGene2 or Human Splicing Finder 3) after in silico insertion of the INSPECT reporter construct.

Insertion sites within native introns can be chosen according to sgRNA efficiency but the distance to splice sites should be considered (>30 nucleotides).

The size of the INSPECT construct equipped with a secreted NLuc is 3133 bp from splice donor to splice acceptor (3076 bp for cytosolic NLuc).

We recommend that each INSPECT construct be validated by RT-(q)PCR flanking the insertion site followed by Sanger sequencing to confirm the sequence integrity of the host RNA.

Statistics and reproducibility

Statistics were calculated with Prism 9 (GraphPad) as indicated. For clarity not all statistical results are graphically presented but complete tabulated results are provided in Supplementary Table 1. All statistical analyses on RT-qPCR data were performed on the Ct (Cq) ∆Ct (∆Cq) or ∆∆Ct (∆∆Cq) values. Fold-changes (using the 2−∆Ct or 2−∆∆Ct method) were only used for graphical visualization and are displayed as geometrical means and geometrical s.d.

A new material made from nanoscale cellulose fibers shows the reverse high thermal conductivity. This makes it useful in areas previously dominated by synthetic polymer materials. Materials based on cellulose have environmental benefits over polymers so research on this could lead to greener technological applications where thermal conductivity is needed.

Cellulose is a key structural component of plant cell walls and is the reason why trees can grow to such heights. But the secret of its material strength actually lies in its overlapping nanoscopic fibers. In recent years many commercial products have used cellulose nanofiber (CNF) materials because their strength and durability make them a good replacement for polymer-based materials such as plastics that can be detrimental to the environment. But now and for the first time a research team led by Professor Junichiro Shiomi from the University of Tokyo’s Graduate School of Engineering has investigated previously unknown thermal properties of CNF and their findings show these materials could be even more useful still.

“If you see plant-derived materials such as cellulose or woody biomass used in applications it’s typically mechanical or thermally insulating properties that are being employed” said Shiomi. “When we explored the thermal properties of a yarn made from CNF however we found that they show a different kind of thermal behavior thermal conduction and it’s very significant around 100 times higher than that of typical woody biomass or cellulose paper.”

The reason yarn made from CNF can conduct heat so well is due to the way it’s made. Cellulose fibers in nature are very disorganized but a process called the flow-focusing method combines cellulose fibers orientating them in the same way to create CNF. It’s this tightly bound and aligned bundle of rod-shaped fibers that allows heat to transfer along the bundle whereas in a more chaotic structure it would dissipate heat more readily.

“Our main challenge was how to measure the thermal conductivity of such small physical samples and with great accuracy” said Shiomi. “For this we turned to a technique called T-type thermal conductivity measurement. It allowed us to measure the thermal conductivity of the rod-shaped CNF yarn samples that are only micrometers (a micrometer equaling one-thousandth of a millimeter) in diameter. But the next step for us is to perform accurate thermal tests on two-dimensional textilelike samples.”

Shiomi and his team hope that their investigation and future explorations into the use of CNF as a thermally conductive material could give engineers an alternative to some environmentally damaging polymers. In applications where heat transfer is important such as certain electronic or computational components it could greatly reduce the consequences of discarded electronic equipment or e-waste thanks to the biodegradable nature of CNF and other plant-based materials.

Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) are purpose-built to manage data and streamline workflows. The software-based solutions are used in laboratories around the world from local clinical analysis facilities to world-class research and development institutions.

The “digital backbone” of labs

American-owned analytical instrument manufacturer Thermo Fisher Scientific describes LIMS technology as the “digital backbone” of laboratories. The ability to track data drastically improves efficiency and productivity reduces operational costs minimises the risks of human error and most importantly drives innovation.

“A LIMS acts as an additional member of your team automating workflows and tracking all the important sample information data workflows and QA/QC results your lab generates each day” reads the Thermo Fisher Scientific website.

The company stresses a good LIMS does more than just track data. It allows personnel to actively manage all laboratory processes from sample intake and labelling to instrument maintenance inventories and staff. Ultimately the ability to streamline digitalise and centralise information has an enormous impact on how laboratories operate.

The key goals of LIMS

LIMS solutions vary depending on the developer and the target industry. However most platforms share the following goals:

Sample management and tracking

From blood serum and tissue to soil and wastewater samples are the bread and butter of most laboratories. A good LIMS platform should feature built-in sample management capabilities. This includes the ability to track samples as they move through the laboratory. Sample management is one of the most important features of LIMS as it helps to maintain the integrity of samples improve data quality and meet chain of custody (CoC) requirements.

Instrument management and maintenance

Mass spectrometers autoclaves and pipetting machines are just some of the instruments featured in modern laboratories. Monitoring the health of laboratory instruments and staying on top of scheduled maintenance and calibration is one of the most important responsibilities of LIMS. Ensuring instruments are in good working condition not only improves the quality of data but reduces the costs associated with unplanned maintenance.

Inventory management

From specialty chemicals and reagents to everyday cleaning products LIMS make it easy to manage laboratory inventories. The systems actively track stock levels and use automatic reorder alerts to ensure products are replenished accordingly. Intelligent laboratory information management systems can also analyse usage and forecast demand based on previous consumption. This ensures labs never run out of ingredients or face supply issues.

Operational management

LIMS software helps managers understand how many personnel the laboratory can accommodate and what type of workflow capacity to expect. This information helps determine timelines and turnaround times.

Complying with Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

SOPs help standardise laboratory practices and ensure data is of the highest possible quality. They safeguard personnel by identifying potential hazards and ensuring experiments meet the strict standards enforced in certain sectors. A central LIMS platform makes it easy for staff to access SOPs at their fingertips.

Improving workflow

Personnel can use LIMS software to build and improve workflows.

Automation

From liquid handling systems to rapid data analysis LIMS helps laboratories embrace automation while retaining complete control over operations.

Collaboration and connectivity

Collaboration is critical in most laboratories. Storing data in a centralised platform makes it easy for personnel to connect collaborate and innovate. This can be with staff in the same room or with personnel working on the other side of the globe.

Integration

LIMS software can be integrated with other tools such as Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) platforms Chromatography Data Systems (CDS) and Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELN).

Archiving data

LIMS stores and tracks data in real time. This helps labs create and retain electronic records and comply with data archival requirements.

Cloud storage

Using LIMS to store data in the cloud allows personnel to access information from anywhere at any time. Cloud infrastructure also offers an extra level of protection when it comes to security system crashes and disaster recovery.

Compliance

Most laboratories must comply with strict industry regulations. LIMS platforms help personnel stay up to date with the latest regulations and comply with standards such as the ISO/IEC 17025:2017 General Requirements for the Competence of Testing and Calibration Laboratories.

Security

Cybersecurity is a serious threat to laboratories particularly those handling sensitive data. LIMS plays a critical role in protecting data integrity and limiting system access.

Mobile functionality

The latest LIMS solutions feature mobile applications that allow personnel to access data on demand. This is particularly useful for personnel that carry out field work. For example environmental analysts collecting and testing water samples onsite.

Data visualisation

Next-generation LIMS platforms make it easy to visualise data and create dashboards reports graphs tables and more. The ability to transform raw data into meaningful information has revolutionised how labs interpret results.

Data analytics

LIMS allows labs to capture share analyse and audit data using a centralised platform.

Budget

From heavily funded institutions like the Large Hadron Collider (CERN) in Switzerland and the Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory in Shanghai to independent research centres and academic facilities LIMS software helps managers budget and allocate resources.

Finding the right LIMS fit

Taking the time to choose the right LIMS solution is an important step. Laboratories should consider their unique needs and choose a LIMS accordingly. For example the ability to actively collect share analyse and archive data across multiple workflows will be a priority for research and development labs. The flexibility to adapt and evolve as new instruments tools and techniques emerge is key.

Below we take a closer look at some examples:

LIMS for bioanalytical laboratories

In bioanalytical laboratories data visibility is front and centre. Labs will benefit from purpose-built LIMS software designed to support bioanalytical analysis and research. Investing in a LIMS platform built with bioanalytical workflows and protocols in mind is a guaranteed way to improve efficiency and data quality.

For example Watson LIMS software from Thermo Fisher Scientific is designed exclusively for bioanalytical drug development laboratories. The platform is integrated with thoughtful features to streamline key processes like sample management analytical runs and data flow. Compliance is a priority with the software designed to meet the strict rules and regulations drug development laboratories must adhere to. All the top pharmaceutical giants in the industry rely on LIMS software to streamline workflows and comply with strict industry protocols.

LIMS for manufacturing laboratories

For manufacturing laboratories a deep understanding of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) is an asset. LIMS platforms designed with SOPs in mind help labs generate high quality and reproducible data. Minimising the need for manual intervention is key and ideally the LIMS should have the ability to automate actions and decisions.

LIMS for chemical and petrochemical laboratories

Chemical and petrochemical labs orbit around purpose-built LIMS software. The centralised systems help labs optimise processes comply with industry regulations and continue to make innovations that improve our everyday lives.

LIMS for cannabis laboratories

The cannabis sector is another industry that depends on LIMS. The industry has boomed following the legalisation of medical cannabis in many US states and countries as well as a growing appreciation for the medicinal benefits of the plant. A recent report published by The Insight Partners predicts the cannabis testing market will be worth almost US$3 billion by 2028. This represents a CAGR of more than 10%. Laboratory information management systems will play a critical role in supporting industry growth and establishing cannabis as a bona fide medicinal product.

In Canada Green Scientific Labs has launched a proprietary Laboratory Information Management System designed to meet the needs of cannabis testing facilities. The custom-built software is packed with innovative features including digital batch downloading real-time data tracking and Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities.

“There is a huge tech component to GSL's testing process that sets us apart from other testing labs in the industry” says Green Scientific Labs Chairman Michael Richmond. “In order to take Green Scientific Labs to the next level support our rapid expansion maintain turnaround times and future proof ourselves for eventual FDA style regulations we needed to take everything we learned and create something special. That's exactly what we did.”

The future of Laboratory Information Management Systems

Demand for cutting-edge Laboratory Information Management Systems will endure as industries continue to grow evolve and innovate. From medical cannabis research to COVID vaccinations labs across all sectors rely on LIMS technology. By 2029 analysts predict the market size for LIMS will hit US$2 billion by 2029. Moving forward LIMS giants like Thermo Fisher Scientific PerkinElmer and Novatek International will continue to integrate technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence into platforms. Tailoring software to meet the unique needs of industries is another trend that will continue to shape the future of LIMS.

If you want to skip our analysis of the retail market you can skip this article and head on to the 5 Largest Retailers in the US in 2022.

The US retail market has continued to grow in recent years and was estimated to occupy a market size of $6.9 trillion in 2022. The country is home to some of the biggest retail stores in the world with companies like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) operating in the country. In 2021 the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions of the US FED spurred growth in sales of all the retail stores in the country as consumers continued to spend freely in a low-interest rate environment. However the outlook for big retailers in 2022 has changed as the FED has continued to raise interest rates amidst high inflation. The high rates are expected to slow down the economy and deteriorate the consumer sentiment in the country as people are likely to focus on increasing their savings in the coming months.

Contrary to the expectations the consumer spending is still very robust. Nearly seventy percent of the US economy is consumer spending and the US GDP registered an annualized 2.6% growth during the third quarter. This is why many retail companies have seen an increase in their sales in the current year. However discount retail stores like Dollar Tree Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) and Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) are positive on their outlook for the coming quarters since they are also experiencing a rise in their store traffic as people started to search for discounted prices.

Even though the consumer price inflation still hovers around 8% the overall retail sales has been growing at double digit rates during third quarter. Amazon.com (AMZN) one of the biggest retailers in the US registered a topline growth rate of 15% during the third quarter however the online retail giant guided for an increase of only 5% for the fourth quarter. So experts and companies are expecting a significant slowdown in retail spending but we have yet to see this in the reported numbers.

Much like other companies in the sector Macy's Inc. (NYSE:M) also seems to be struggling as the demand for its products slows down. The company's annual revenue spiked by 40% in 2021 but the company has seen normalization in sales during 2022. Due to the worsening state of the economy Macy's Inc. (NYSE:M) cut down its full-year revenue and profit guidance in its last quarterly result.

On September 28 2022 Macy's Inc. (NYSE:M) announced the launch of a third-party marketplace for sellers and brands. The establishment of a third-party marketplace could help the company in reducing the extra inventory at hand which it had procured earlier at the start of 2022.

Aristotle Capital Management Global Equity which sold out of its Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) stake during Q2 discussed its reasoning for stepping to the sidelines in the fund's Q1 2022 investor letter:

We first invested in Walgreens Boots Alliance in early 2013. Over our holding period Walgreens merged with U.K.-based Boots Alliance establishing itself as a global leading retail pharmacy chain. CEO Stefano Pessina set the company on a path of pursuing strategic partnerships (as opposed to vertical integration deals) to increase store traffic and to over time transform the business into a neighborhood health destination around a more modern pharmacy. Using its strong FREE cash flow generation the company ramped up its investments in technology aiming to accelerate the digitalization of health information. Mr. Pessina was not successful however at turning around the firm's US retail segment and had to deal with increasing prescription drug reimbursement pressures. He stepped down as CEO in 2020 and in 2021 Roz Brewer took the reins of the firm. We admire Ms. Brewer's impressive track record at companies that include Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Walmart (Sam's Club). However given management's decision to divest core cash-generative businesses and redeploy capital to embryonic healthcare startups we prefer to step aside while we follow the company's progress.

Here is what Madison Mid Cap Fund has to say about Ross Stores Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:

Ross Stores is one of our longest-tenured holdings. Its profits have gyrated wildly since the beginning of the pandemic first from store closures and shutdowns then from the pent-up demand for apparel and more recently from the economic uncertainty. Adding to that Ross is finding that consumers' spending trends in terms of mix and categories have been more difficult to predict than usual resulting in some mismatches between its merchandise assortment and what shoppers want. This doesn't appear to be a Ross-specific issue as other apparel retailers have reported similar problems. We attribute this to the unusual post-pandemic environment and while we don't have a crystal ball as to when this will normalize we believe it will.

Here's what LRT Capital Management said about Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:

Executive Summary At LRT Capital Management we are continuously searching the market for great investment opportunities. Our favorite finds are companies with moats and growth opportunities that justify a higher price than what the stock is trading for. One of our holdings (approximately 1.5% of our long exposure) is Dollar General (DG) so today we wanted to tell you a bit about this great company. Company Overview Dollar General is a discount retailer with the largest brick-and-mortar presence in the United States by store count. The company's largest concentration of stores can be found in the southern southwestern midwestern and eastern parts of the United States.10 Dollar General was founded in 1939 by J.L. Turner who originally named the company ""J.L. Turner and Son Wholesale"". As the name suggests the company began its life as a wholesaler but quickly turned to a retailer of general store goods. By the early 1950s the company had annual sales of $2 million per year12 which is the equivalent of $22.95 million in 2021 dollars when adjusted for inflation. The first Dollar General store opened on June 01 1955 in Springfield Kentucky. The simple concept was that no item in the store would cost more than one dollar. The company changed its name to Dollar General Corporation in 1968 when Dollar General became publicly traded. At the time of its initial public offering the business generated more than $40 million in annual sales. The company's common stock was publicly traded from 1968 until July 2007 when it was taken private by KKR. The company went public again in November 2009 under the ticker DG. Today Dollar General is an evolved and phenomenal business with more room for growth.

The company's main products are every-day necessities and consumables purchased by lower income consumers on tight budgets…

7. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT )

Market Cap: $72.67 billion

Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is the 7th largest retailer in the US operating 1938 stores in the country. The company offers a diverse range of products across various categories including beauty food and beverage apparel and accessories and home furnishings and décor. The company has an employee base of over 400 thousand people across 50 states in the United States.

The company has been able to grow its sales significantly during the previous year as it reported revenue of $104.6 billion in 2021 up 13% compared to $92.4 billion in 2020. Earlier in October Target and Apple announced a collaboration under which Target will have more locations for Apple products allowing consumers to buy more of the company's offerings during the holiday season.

Ensemble Capital shared its stance on Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:

Speaking on their earnings call Target's CEO Brian Cornell said that spending on items such as kitchen appliances TVs and outdoor furniture – products that consumers splurged on while stuck at home – has declined sharply. While they had expected there to be a shift from spending on goods to services as America exited pandemic lifestyles they didn't anticipate the speed and magnitude of the shift. On the other hand they saw luggage sales grow by an astounding 50% along with robust growth in ""going out"" categories such as sunscreen beauty products and even toys as families return to hosting large birthday parties for their children. So despite Target seeing increasing foot traffic and higher spending overall they got caught with the wrong inventory relative to what customers wanted to buy. What this means for investors is that it is incorrect to say that the consumer is weak despite weakness in some consumer facing companies. Rather what people are spending money on is changing rapidly which is good or bad for a given company based on what they sell. Importantly with demand shifting from items that were in short supply there is good reason to think that inflation in these categories will moderate. Indeed Target stated that their plan was to put their excess inventory on sale something that consumers haven't seen a lot of over the past two years. But as demand for COVID era goods moderates demand for activities such as travel has surged driving up inflation in airline tickets and hotel rooms. This illustrates the way that the shock waves from the pandemic have scrambled the typical economic cycle such that even at a time when all signs point to the biggest summer travel season in history investors are worried that we are headed into or are already in a recession.

6. The TJX Companies Inc. (NYSE:TJX )

Market Cap: $82.14 billion

The TJX Companies Inc. (NYSE:TJX) is a major off-price retailer of clothing home goods and other items operating 4689 stores worldwide. It offers a broad range of branded items at discounted prices via its strategic purchases of inventory from its 21000 suppliers worldwide. The store typically offers products at a discount in the range of 20%-60% compared to other retailers. The United States is a key geographic location for the company and in the fiscal year 2022 the region contributed to 79% of the company's overall sales.

The TJX Companies Inc. (NYSE:TJX) had a record growth in sales during the fiscal year 2022 as it reported sales of $48.5 billion up 51% from $32.1 billion in 2021. However the sales have started to normalize in the current year and the company's net sales declined by 2% YoY in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.

The ClearBridge Investments Large Cap Value Strategy liked the potential post-pandemic customer surge to The TJX Companies Inc. (NYSE:TJX) as revealed in the fund's Q4 2021 investor letter:

The pandemic created opportunities for us to be more aggressive in a variety of areas of the market. We were opportunistic throughout the year for example in positioning the portfolio to benefit from a flush consumer eager to return to spending and traveling. New positions included TJX an off-brand retailer with a large presence in the US and Europe that should continue to benefit from the contraction of many traditional retailers particularly as consumer spending resumes.

Reactions were swift with many users across social media expressing shock but for most of us this fell right in line with him wearing a MAGA hat and saying slavery was a choice.

Vogue’s global fashion editor Gabriella Karefa-Johnson was then bullied and berated by West after she called his actions “irresponsible.” This caused a wave of support from large names in the industry such as Gigi Hadid and Hailey Bieber coming to her defense. But this was only the start for Ye and he would soon come to find the ramifications of his behavior.

Parts of this article will reference offensive language including quotes of antisemitic comments.

Kanye West’s Antisemitic Comments

Then not even a week later the rapper tweeted that he was “going death con 3 ON JEWISH PEOPLE” then proceeded to add “You guys have toyed with me and tried to black ball anyone whoever opposes your agenda.” The post has since been removed but it came after he accused Sean “Diddy” Combs of being controlled by “the Jewish people.” These comments were clearly antisemitic and West was removed from Instagram and Twitter due to hate speech but he didn’t stop there.

West then went on to conduct several bizarre interviews with Piers Morgan—after previously doing one with Tucker Carlson—where he tried to justify his bigotry and antisemitism. In these interviews it seemed like the only thing he was clinging to was the fact that he was a billionaire. Well … the chickens have come home to roost and he’s the one that called them. Without further ado here are all the brands and companies that dropped Kanye West causing him to lose his billionaire status. For now—I’m sure there will be more to come.

The Gap

Candace Owens and Kanye West at Paris Fashion Week

Before Fashion Week even began Ye gave notice to The Gap that he was ending their contract due to a breach of contract which resulted in the company severing ties in September. The deal was inked in 2020 and was meant for a 10-year period but it came to a screeching halt only two years later.

Ye also accused the company of stealing designs and keeping him out of meetings. On October 25 the brand shut down its Yeezy-related website and said in a statement that it was “taking immediate steps to remove Yeezy Gap product from our stores.” In regards to the antisemitic comments they said “antisemitism racism and hate in any form are inexcusable and not tolerated in accordance with our values.”

Def Jam

The rapper and producer had a 10-year deal with Def Jam which was fulfilled with the release of 2021’s Donda. According to a statement by Universal Music Group “Def Jam’s relationship with Ye as a recording artist Def Jam’s partnership with the GOOD Music label venture and Ye’s merchandise agreement with Bravado all ended in 2021.”

They went on to denounce antisemitism saying “There is no place for antisemitism in our society. We are deeply committed to combating antisemitism and every other form of prejudice.” At this point I’m certain that no major recording label will ever touch him with a 10-foot pole.

JP Morgan Chase

Though not directly a cause of West’s harmful remarks Chase was caught in the whirlwind purely due to timing. Ye had previously criticized the bank for not giving him access to their CEO and Chairman Jamie Dimon. He also said he planned to cut ties with the bank but in a “gotcha” moment they cut ties with him first.

According to sources West received a letter on September 20 informing him of the Bank’s decision giving him 60 days to find a new financial institution. This matter became conflated with his bigoted remarks when Candace Owens posted said letter on October 12.

Instagram and Twitter

The social media giants Instagram and Twitter were the first to take action against West since it was their platforms being used to spread hate speech. Ye began his comments on Instagram and after being restricted he moved to Twitter where the same thing happened. Both companies have removed the offending statements but as of October 27 full access to his Instagram and Twitter have been restored.

Balenciaga

Over the years West has cultivated a close relationship with Balenciaga’s creative director Demna Gvasalia which is why he was allowed to open for them for fashion week. On October 21 the brand announced it too had cut ties with West. In a statement from their parent company Kering the brand said “Balenciaga has no longer any relationship nor any plans for future projects related to this artist.” And thus the scrubbing began.

All traces of Ye were removed from the brand’s Instagram as well as Vogue photos that had been there previously. The brand has also removed its section dedicated to Yeezy Gap Engineered by Balenciaga which launched back in January.

Creative Arts Agency

On October 24 CAA notably one of the most influential talent agencies in Los Angeles dropped West from its roster.

MRC

Shortly after the CAA MRC — a company focused on film and television production — announced that it would shelve a completed documentary about West instead of airing it.

MRC executives said in a statement on October 24: “We cannot support any content that amplifies his platform. The silence from leaders and corporations when it comes to Kanye or antisemitism in general is dismaying but not surprising. What is new and sad is the fear Jews have about speaking out in their own defense.”

Adidas

Yeezy Season 4 Fashion Week

Kanye has been in a one-sided public beef with Adidas for months because they have consistently refused to engage with him. Falling in line with his critiques of The Gap Ye claimed that Adidas stole his designs and left him out of planning. During the beginning stages of his complaints there were notable celebrities who came to his defense such as Nia Long and Diddy.

However none of that matters anymore because due to mounting pressure the brand released a statement: “After repeated efforts to privately resolve the situation we have taken the decision to place the partnership under review.”

On Twitter Ye responded “F— ADIDAS I AM ADIDAS ADIDAS RAPED AND STOLE MY DESIGNS.” The brand responded on October 25 that it would immediately end production of all Yeezy products and stop all payments to West and his affiliates. The loss of this partnership cost Ye his billionaire status.

Foot Locker

Later that same day Foot Locker announced that it would be removing all Yeezy products from the floor and instructed sales associates to wait for further instructions.

Peloton

In an unexpected statement the stationary-bike company announced it would no longer be using West’s music in connection with its products.

In a statement released on October 25 the company said: “We take this issue very seriously and can confirm Peloton indefinitely paused the use of Kanye West’s music on our platform. This means our instructors are no longer using his music in any newly produced classes and we are not suggesting any class that includes his music in our proactive recommendations to Members.”

TJX Companies

The multinational cooperation which operates chains like Ross and Marshalls released a statement on the 26th that they would no longer procure any Yeezy Merchandise.

The corporation said: “At TJX we do not tolerate discrimination harassment or hate of any kind. We have instructed our buying teams not to purchase this merchandise for sale in any of our stores globally.”

Madame Tussauds London

According to the BBC the famed wax museum has removed West’s model and placed it in an archive.

These are just the brands that Ye has had some sort of relationship with whether it be formal or informal. If he continues like this (he most likely will) there will be companies that preemptively come out to condemn his actions. But one thing’s for certain the world is surely crumbling around Ye. Amidst everything that’s going on he was recently removed from the headquarters of sketchers and there have been calls to remove his music from Spotify and Apple Music.

Raw material prices have risen consistently over the last year which has made it difficult to produce and source many parts. The automotive and transportation industries are feeling the impact of the microchip shortage a critical component needed to build the semitrucks on the road and which are essential for keeping the supply chain moving. In response truck manufacturers have either slowed production or halted building altogether until they can get the supplies they need.

For the trucking and logistics industry this means that new truck and trailer orders are either being partially filled or they are being delayed until further notice. With the supply chain already facing multiple challenges like the driver shortage and port congestion this throws another wrench into the equation. Many companies are going the extra mile to repair trucks and trailers in their fleet to ensure their equipment is safe and road-ready for their customers.

However with the ongoing parts shortage fleet maintenance shops are struggling to keep up. With the continuation of parts and microchip shortages fleets have been forced to run vehicles past conventional life cycles. In this environment carriers must look at maintaining their vehicles well in advance to ensure their current fleet can withstand wear and tear while remaining in the best condition possible. By performing proactive repairs and anticipating parts shortages companies can boost their equipment’s life cycle and its overall efficiency despite macro challenges in the parts market.

Managing a large fleet

It’s not uncommon to see fleets have more trailers on hand than they do tractors. Sometimes those trailers have cargo onboard that can’t be unloaded right away so rather than sit around and wait for it to be unloaded drivers can drop one trailer pickup another and be on their way. This enables fleets to maximize driver utilization.

LTL fleets typically have trailer-to-tractor ratios above two to one. This allows them to ensure they have enough resources at the start of each day to move shipments. But it takes the shipper carrier and receiver all working together to effectively manage resources ensuring trailers get unloaded and loaded on time and providing visibility to each other.

LTL carriers also have to manage utilization carefully because they allow multiple shippers to share space on the same trailer. Technology can be one piece of the puzzle but fleet managers and terminal operators also keep meticulous maintenance records. They’re key to knowing when to bring tractors or trailers into the shop for maintenance and logging what work is completed.

The shop is also one of the most important operations for any fleet. It has to ensure it has the parts or the tools on hand to complete a repair. If it doesn’t the fleet manager might be able to direct that piece of equipment to another terminal where that shop is better equipped to handle a repair. The shop manager also has to coordinate well in advance and know what parts are most used or replaced most often ensure that the shop has enough stock and anticipate needs in advance of repairs.

It's truly a team effort to keep the shops stocked with parts and tools coordinate bringing trailers and tractors in for repairs and understand how much time the equipment will be offline all while ensuring the rest of the fleet remains operational.

Predictive maintenance and maximizing uptime

The manifests that both the technology and shop managers keep are extremely important when tracking utilization and maintenance needs. Nowadays there’s so much data available around how long a part can effectively run before it is most likely to break down that companies can use this information to perform maintenance before the part breaks. This style of preventative maintenance helps reduce the chances of costly breakdowns on the road which might cause an accident or require a tow truck for assistance adding more costs that impact revenue.

Whether replacing a worn tire or swapping a piece in the engine doing so while the truck or trailer completes a trip is more costly. Not only does the equipment need to be fixed but the downtime can delay the shipment. This might cause the driver to have to wait until the next day to complete the shipment which cuts into driver utilization or the carrier might be charged a late fee. In either scenario it cuts into the bottom line of the carrier.

If implemented and utilized correctly a predictive maintenance schedule can help fleets maximize uptime and avoid the massive repairs that happen when something goes wrong on the road. This isn’t to say that performing replacements/repairs before something breaks will work out perfectly. Fleets should always prepare for emergencies and be ready to adjust on the fly.

But as the part and equipment shortage marches on fleets should be doing everything in their power to get ahead of any issues. Maximizing tractor and trailer uptime only benefits companies in the long run as avoiding costly repairs on the road and increasing utilization improves the bottom line.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndiYXkuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvMDcvMjAyMi12ZXRlcmFucy1kYXktb2ZmZXJzL9IBSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndiYXkuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvMDcvMjAyMi12ZXRlcmFucy1kYXktb2ZmZXJzLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2022 Veterans Day offers,"Friday updates: Home Depot HuHot Qdoba

But the laundry room was not on the property. And Ms. Simone was already paying a cleaning fee on top of that.

“Oh my God trying to get an Airbnb in America — I don’t even think I’m going to do it anymore” said Ms. Simone a content creator who makes her living off traveling the world. In the end Ms. Simone opted not to do the laundry.

Many Airbnb users have found themselves in similar predicaments — high fees and high checkout expectations — and Airbnb has heard their complaints “loud and clear” its chief executive Brian Chesky said on Twitter.

Starting in December Airbnb will give users the option of viewing the total price of their stays before taxes including what guests have increasingly described as out-of-control cleaning fees the company announced on Monday. Some have complained of having a listing’s price balloon during the checkout process because of the fees.

To skip our detailed analysis you can go directly to see the top 5 insurance companies in USA.

The United States is the biggest insurance market in the world by far by premium volume making up around 40% of the total global premiums written. The history of the insurance industry in the country is vast and rich with Benjamin Frankling himself also forming a mutual insurance company known as the Philadelphia Contributorship in 1752 and is actually the oldest still operating insurance carrier in the country. There are three types of insurance sectors operating in the United States: property/casualty life/annuity and private health insurance. Property/casualty insurance deals with insurance pertaining to home commercial and auto insurance. Meanwhile life/annuity deals with life insurance in addition to annuity products. However we'd first like to discuss health insurance in the United States.

Biggest Insurance Companies in the World

austin-distel-jpHw8ndwJ_Q-unsplash

Private health insurance in the United States is extremely interesting; it is the only developed country in the world to not have social healthcare which is where private insurance comes in. In the U.S. healthcare is often tied to employment with employers providing health insurance to their employees rather than the government. Instead of a basic right health coverage is a privilege or incentive in the country. While there have been attempts to nationalize healthcare in the country they have not been successful at all. If you are not insured in the U.S. then only luck can help you out in most cases. Hospitals often overbill people significantly and even normal prices in the U.S. for procedures medicine surgeries and hospital charges are much higher than in most other countries. Hospitals overcharge so that they can then negotiate with insurers who can make the hospitals reduce their bills. On the other hand the average uninsured person neither has the time nor the wherewithal to challenge hospitals and are stuck paying incredibly expensive bills which can cripple their financial situation. Of course there are many companies which earn billions of dollars at the expense of the health of the average person and many of these make our list of the top insurance companies in the U.S. as well.

The property/casualty sector in the insurance industry makes up around 53% of the total premiums underwritten while life/annuity accounted for 47%. Healthcare insurance is incorporated within these two sectors and not measured separately. Net premiums in 2021 were $1.4 trillion according to the Insurance Information Institute while providing employment to more than 2.8 million people according to the Department of Labor. However the insurance industry's outlook isn't as rosy considering that the world seems to be imminently heading into a recession while inflation is seeing record highs in many countries in 2022. This is leading to challenge of generating profits from underwriting exists in such an economic situation and the requirement of the top insurance companies in the USA needing to adapt the latest technology and overhaul their systems to improve efficiency and cut costs where possible.

The assets held by these giants are worth around $9.6 trillion providing employment to around 1.5 million people. To determine our ranking for the top insurance companies in the USA we considered revenue profits assets and the number of employees each company has.

LAS VEGAS Nov. 7 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Trimble (NASDAQ: TRMB) and Exyn Technologies a pioneer in multi-platform robotic autonomy for complex GPS-denied environments announced today a strategic collaboration to explore the use of autonomous construction surveying technology. The solution will integrate Boston Dynamics' Spot® robot the ExynPak™ powered by ExynAI™ and the Trimble® X7 total station. It will enable fully autonomous missions inside complex and dynamic construction environments which can result in consistent and precise reality capture for production and quality control workflows.

Exyn Technologies and Trimble Collaborate on a Proof of Concept for a Fully Autonomous Surveying Solution for Construction

""The integration of autonomous surveying technology into a construction workflow has groundbreaking potential"" said Aviad Almagor vice president of Technology Innovation Trimble. ""It can improve operational efficiency and transparency throughout the build lifecycle while also transforming worker safety for potentially hazardous data collection.""

Autonomous robots powered by ExynAI can sense and avoid obstacles dynamically adapting to the ever-changing complexity of construction environments. To ensure the utmost safety and efficiency the ExynPak mounts and integrates with a robot supporting level 4 of autonomous exploration missions without requiring the robot to ""learn"" about its environment beforehand. A surveyor simply defines a 3D volume for a mission and the integrated robotic solution handles the complexities of self-navigation without needing a map GPS or wireless infrastructure.

The integration of the Trimble X7 provides high-speed high-accuracy 3D laser scanning to capture the state of the environment. The captured data can be uploaded to the Trimble Connect® collaboration platform and shared with project stakeholders for further analysis including a comparison to Building Information Models (BIM) and previous scans to monitor quality and progress. The end result is a map of unprecedented detail and accuracy collected with minimal human intervention and risk.

""Industry has been waiting for reliable and robust autonomous technology to transform difficult and dangerous activities. Exyn's technology is helping to enable a new front in human-robot collaboration. By working with preeminent leaders such as Trimble we aim to create adaptable state-of-the-art systems to tackle the complexities across construction and industrial environments"" said Nader Elm CEO of Exyn Technologies.

Exyn and Trimble will be demonstrating this technology at the Trimble Dimensions+ Conference November 7-9 in Las Vegas.

The businesses that have struck such agreements include the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer the consulting groups Ernst & Young and AECOM insurers Prudential and Definity Financial private equity firms BlackRock and the Carlyle Group the technology company Trimble and the telecommunications giant Telefónica.

Over the past two years each of those companies has secured a lending agreement known as a credit facility that links the interest rate charged by banks to the company’s internal diversity targets creating a financial incentive to meet them. If the business achieves its targets it won’t have to pay as much interest on the loans it takes out; if it falls short it is required to pay more.

Under the terms of BlackRock’s $4.4 billion credit facility for example Wells Fargo will lower the firm’s interest rate by 0.05 percent if it hits two benchmarks—a 30 percent increase in the share of black and Hispanic employees by 2024 and a 3 percent increase in the share of female executives each year—or hike the rate by the same amount if it misses both.

The agreements which typically involve multiple banks are effectively credit cards for businesses: Rather than make a onetime loan lenders extend a continuous line of credit that companies can dip into at will either to cover operating costs or as a rainy day fund for emergencies. That means changes in a facility’s interest rate—even modest ones like BlackRock’s 0.05 percent diversity adjustment—can have an appreciable effect on a business’s bottom line.

Companies have advertised these agreements as proof of their progressive bona fides. Trimble CEO Rob Painter for example said the company’s credit facility—which conditions interest rates on the percentage of female employees—illustrates Trimble’s ""commitment"" to ""gender diversity in the workplace."" In press releases announcing their own credit facilities executives at BlackRock Prudential and Definity say the agreements demonstrate their commitment to ""accountability.""

But critics see something far more sinister: a form of blatant discrimination that will harm consumers credit markets and the rule of law.

""If a bank penalized a company's credit rating because it had too many women or was too racially diverse we would be appalled"" said one senior government regulator who managed a nine-figure credit facility as a lawyer in private practice. ""This is the exact same thing except the penalized target is white men.""

The credit contracts will divert resources away from consumers critics say and toward diversity initiatives where the promise of discounted loans will encourage the use of illegal hiring quotas. They will also hurt companies that don’t negotiate a diversity discount on their loans because those firms will face higher borrowing costs than their competitors—a dynamic that could steer entire industries toward race-conscious policies.

""Let’s say Wells Fargo will loan to BlackRock at 1 percent if it meets diversity quotas and the market interest rate is 5 percent"" said Will Hild the executive director of Consumers’ Research. ""Every other company that has to borrow at 5 percent is now at a disadvantage vis-à-vis BlackRock. So other companies will have to follow BlackRock’s lead or they will go out of business because BlackRock will be able to subsidize its products through Wells Fargo.""

BlackRock Wells Fargo and Bank of America which manages the credit facilities for Trimble Carlyle and Pfizer did not respond to requests for comment.

The contracts represent a new twist on the Environmental Social and Governance (ESG)-linked loans that have proliferated in recent years. When banks lend to businesses they typically base interest rates on several factors such as a company’s cost structure or debt ratio that drive credit risk. Since 2017 however some banks have also factored in ESG considerations—a borrower’s carbon footprint for example—in addition to the ability to pay back a loan.

With diversity quotas in the mix that gap between credit risk and credit access has only grown. ""There is no evidence that diversity makes a borrower likelier to repay its loan"" the government regulator said. ""It’s like handing out credit based on astrological sign.""

When a bank lends irrationally to one client the regulator added it ""invariably makes its loan terms less fairly priced for everyone else.""

The credit deals come as race-conscious programs are exploding across corporate America—and sometimes in the companies’ own faces. Pfizer one of the businesses that has tied its lending costs to diversity was sued in September over a prestigious fellowship that bars white and Asian applicants. Programs at Microsoft IBM and Google use similar criteria as do American Express and Amazon both of which are now facing civil rights lawsuits.

Race-conscious loans will encourage such policies legal experts said and could expose companies to legal liability. Even if businesses don’t adopt overt quotas said Adam Mortara a prominent civil rights litigator the agreements could be used as evidence that the firing of a white or Asian employee was racially motivated ""because of the incentives this kind of race-based discounting creates.""

That said it’s not clear whether the contracts are illegal in and of themselves. There is no federal civil rights law that directly bans discrimination in business loans three lawyers said unlike discrimination in consumer lending and employment and lawyers were divided on whether the agreements would hold up in court.

""You could argue the agreements themselves are permissible as long as the businesses reach their diversity targets without violating civil rights law"" said Hild who also founded the public interest law firm Cause of Action. ""Of course—if there were a way to do that—they wouldn’t need these agreements.""

Other lawyers said the contracts created such a strong incentive to discriminate that courts might strike them down. If a business cannot boost its minority employment through race-blind means said James Copland the director of legal policy at the Manhattan Institute hard quotas will be the only way for it to avoid losing money under the terms of the lending agreement.

""This is an implicit violation of the Title VII"" the law that prohibits employment discrimination Copland told the Free Beacon. ""It has to be illegal.""

Credit facilities are the product of complex confidential negotiations between a company and its lenders making it difficult to know which party proposed what provisions though all clauses must have the signoff of both banks and borrowers.

It might seem odd for businesses to risk a choice between breaking the law or hurting their pocketbooks and odder still for them to celebrate it. But if a company is ideologically committed to quotas Hild said the credit deals can make a kind of circular sense in both economic and legal terms.

Economically the company gets a discount for a policy that it was already going to implement. Legally it gets a shield against shareholders who see diversity initiatives as a drag on business performance—because under the terms of the loan agreement more diversity means lower costs.

""The company can argue that its diversity policies make borrowing less expensive and thus fulfill its legal obligation to shareholders"" said Dan Morenoff the executive director of the American Civil Rights Project who has filed shareholder lawsuits against corporate executives over their race-conscious programs.

The counterargument Morenoff added is that these policies are very vulnerable to civil rights complaints. If a court enjoins a company’s race-conscious programs it might not be able to meet the diversity targets specified in its credit agreement in which case the cost of borrowing would go up.

The calculus is similarly complex for banks. On the one hand lenders will make less money if they loan to businesses at a discounted rate. On the other hand Hild said linking the discounts to ESG objectives including diversity may boost banks’ ESG scores and thus attract capital from ESG investors—some of which like BlackRock are themselves the recipients of ESG loans.

The private equity firm also owns 7.1 percent of Wells Fargo the bank managing its credit facility and likely holds stock in other participating lenders as well Morenoff said. So when BlackRock secures an ESG loan from those banks it may indirectly be boosting the value of its own equities.

The result—if nobody sues—is a win-win for both lender and borrower. The losers are innovators pensioners and the consumers who will bear the costs of a distorted market.

""The purpose of bank lending is to allocate capital to its best use so that we can have better products at a lower price"" Hild said. ""If you subsidize diversity you are focusing the market on other things.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL3RyaW1ibGUtY29uc3RydWN0aW9uLWNsb3VkLXBvd2VyZWQtYnktbWljcm9zb2Z0LWF6dXJlLWxhdW5jaGVzLWF0LXRyaW1ibGUtZGltZW5zaW9ucy1jb25mZXJlbmNlLTMwMTY2OTg1MC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trimble Construction Cloud Powered by Microsoft Azure Launches at Trimble Dimensions+ Conference,"Construction-Focused Cloud Platform is the New Backbone of Trimble Construction One Enabling Project Teams to Better Design Construct Operate and Manage Projects

LAS VEGAS Nov. 7 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Trimble (NASDAQ: TRMB) today announced the launch of Trimble Construction Cloud powered by Microsoft Azure an industry cloud to streamline construction projects. Trimble Construction Cloud was developed as part of Trimble's collaboration with Microsoft to advance technology adoption and accelerate the digital transformation of the construction agriculture and transportation industries.

Trimble Construction Cloud takes advantage of Microsoft Azure services including Logic Apps Azure DevOps and Azure Kubernetes Service. The platform links project teams data processes and multiple stakeholders—such as general contractors subcontractors designers engineers and owners—across all phases of construction projects. Connecting people processes and workflows enables projects to be completed better faster safer cheaper and greener. By providing seamless collaboration from the field to the back office Trimble Construction Cloud provides a trusted environment where transparency and actionable data are the new norm. It is also the sole construction industry cloud for Microsoft customers.

""Trimble Construction Cloud enables customers to accelerate and deliver improved business outcomes with data from native Trimble and ecosystem of services"" said Jennifer Lin senior vice president and chief platform officer for Trimble. ""It empowers project teams to design construct operate collaborate and learn with live data sharing. This unique approach leverages connected workflows precise spatial data and constructible models to modernize the entire ecosystem and accelerate customer success. We're excited to help customers and partners achieve more productively and sustainability than before.""

Trimble Construction Cloud will launch as the cloud solution powering Trimble Construction One a purpose-built connected construction management offering that includes rich field data estimating detailing project management finance and human capital management solutions. Non-Trimble Construction One users can subscribe to Trimble Construction Cloud independently as a separate service.

Trimble Construction Cloud includes four main functions designed to automate the flow of data and decision-making for more efficient and predictable business outcomes:

Common Data Environment: Task-specific point solutions have created the fragmentation of data and losses in handoffs as construction is increasingly a mixed fleet world with different equipment technology software and information—each of which handle different parts of the construction lifecycle. Trimble Construction Cloud features one centralized common data environment that connects the office with site operations tools enabling Trimble and non-Trimble solutions to automatically integrate into one usable data set. This provides enhanced data visibility and unites stakeholders across jobs teams and departments with the right information at the right time to make the right decisions.

This provides enhanced data visibility and unites stakeholders across jobs teams and departments with the right information at the right time to make the right decisions. Configured and Custom Workflows : Despite the number of repetitive tasks inherent to construction most contractors still run their businesses manually which is time-consuming and error prone. Trimble Construction Cloud solves this challenge with configured and customizable workflows that help project teams automate different aspects of their business with commonly used workflows as well as by building and deploying their own around critical job roles and specific business objectives. The cloud's three configured workflows include a model-to-procurement built for Mechanical Engineering and Plumbing (MEP); a model-to-fabrication for structures; and a civil bid-to-build for site management.

The cloud's three configured workflows include a model-to-procurement built for Mechanical Engineering and Plumbing (MEP); a model-to-fabrication for structures; and a civil bid-to-build for site management. Live Data/Model Sharing: Collaborating across projects in real-time has always been difficult for project teams. Trimble Construction Cloud provides customers with the ability to subscribe to unique capabilities across Trimble and non-Trimble solutions such as Microsoft Teams that serve to enhance and facilitate collaboration across project teams. The Live Sharing capability allows for real-time model collaboration for both Trimble and non-Trimble solutions. With Live Sharing multiple users can be in several Trimble solutions—such as Quadri Trimble Connect and Tekla—and view model changes as they happen. Users with non-Trimble solutions can also collaborate in the same modeling process as well.

Trimble Developer Portal: Instead of reaching out to various organizations within a business to gain access to a report or specific type of data Trimble Construction Cloud centralizes the discovery learning provisioning support and successful application of APIs through the Trimble Developer Portal. An easily accessible centralized portal is designed to facilitate faster onboarding and integration leading to more productive developer experiences.

""Cloud-based solutions are designed to take industries to the next level to compete in today's marketplace"" said Casey McGee vice president of Global ISV Sales Microsoft. ""Trimble Construction Cloud connects disparate systems and provides new workflows so stakeholders have the visibility and fluidity they need to further enhance digital transformation.""

Ludacris’ love for the A is so real that the Atlanta Braves made him an honorary member of the team. To commemorate the moment the Fast & Furious actor showed off the baseball team’s gift to him — a World Series championship ring.

Last November the Braves defeated the Houston Astros in Game 6 of the World Series. The victory marked the team’s first championship win since 1995. In an Instagram video posted on Saturday (Nov. 5) Derek Schiller the team’s president and CEO presented Luda with the new bling at the Braves’ Cobb County stadium Truist Park. In a matrimony-inspired presentation Schiller asked the “Southern Hospitality” rapper if he was willing to wed the team through “sickness and in health through wins and losses more wins than losses.”

“It says Ludacris on there. I can’t believe this I’m shaking” joked Luda who finally exclaimed “Yes I do!” In another video the area code connoisseur showed off the ring as he joked that he was an official member of the team.

The ring — made of 18.71-karat white gold and 14-karat yellow gold — contains 755 diamonds 19 genuine rubies and one genuine pearl. Each ring includes the player’s signature as well as a host of other details including a miniature replica of Truist Park the franchise’s signature “A” and the team’s slogan. According to Forbes the ring cost roughly $25000.

Outkast’s Big Boi is another honorary recipient of the team’s championship ring. The Atlanta native and Ludacris both performed during the team’s World Series championship parade and celebration. “This is up there with winning Album of the Year the Grammy and performing at the Super Bowl. It’s the same thing” he said on the “Throwing Fits” podcast. “It’s for the city. The last time we won the World Series is when we first started [Outkast].”

But some good things have grown out of the experiences gained in coping with the pandemic. For many school districts one of those positive developments has been a greater focus on the routine use of bus seating charts. Assigning seats is not a new practice as some districts have been taking this approach for years. For others though what became necessary to avoid the spread of an infectious disease is now seen as an advantageous strategy for a calmer school bus environment.

“Seating arrangements can be used to make riders feel at ease and as positive rewards for good behavior” noted transportation consultant Launi Schmutz-Harden. “Everyone likes to know they have a seat and where it is ahead of time.”

The consultant who retired as director of transportation for Washington County School District in southwest Utah just prior to the pandemic added that students do best with a daily routine and feel more secure and comfortable when they know where to sit. With that in mind school bus drivers can reward positive behavior by assigning students to sit with friends or in areas they otherwise prefer. But more importantly the practice can be especially helpful in times of emergencies.

Evolving Use:

At Oregon’s Beaverton School District the pandemic became the catalyst for requiring drivers to use seating charts explained Craig Beaver administrator for transportation.

“We instituted them to aid with student identification and cohorting with much success” he said. “While we did not require seating charts this year we strongly encouraged drivers to chart their elementary students.” About one-third of the district’s drivers have continued the practice finding it has been helpful in getting to know their students. Charts have also aided drivers in determining which students assigned to the route are not utilizing the service. “Sometimes this allows us to remove a stop or adjust routing to relieve overcrowding on another route” Beaver added.

A similar direction was taken by Sweetwater County School District in Green River Wyoming. Before the pandemic seating assignments were standard only for elementary students but that has changed.

“We were starting the practice of using them for the older students and then COVID made it so that we could enforce it more regularly” recalled Rachel Todd the transportation supervisor. “We will continue the practice of seating charts for not only routes but also over-the-road trips.”

Todd said the practice has significantly helped in managing student behavior. Her drivers start with letting students pick their assigned seats within pre-set parameters. But if they don’t follow the bus rules they are moved to a “hot” seat.

The details on charts can also help with following up on incidents such as identifying the guilty party when a seat has been vandalized or locating a lost book bag or another item. They may also prove timely in the event of a more serious incident.

“If you have your seating chart and are adhering to it and there is an accident you don’t have to scramble to fill one out for the first responders” Todd said. Too dealing with parents can be less challenging when seating information is readily available. “When we keep record of the seating charts in the office and a parent calls with a complaint about another student we can see how close they are to that student” Todd noted. “This helps with identifying possible bullying situations.”

The pandemic was also a main factor in initiating the use of seat-ing charts at Bend La Pine Schools in Bend Oregon. First employed to support COVID-19 contact tracing seating charts brought favorable results and officials do not plan to abandon it Kim Crabtree director of transportation said.

“There was push back from drivers for the extra work but it did not take too long for them to see the benefits” she recalled. “While we’re not going to make it mandatory the majority of our drivers want to continue [it] and we are encouraging the practice.”

Janet Ulrich director of transportation for Aurora Public Schools in Colorado said she likes that the use of charts gives drivers options such as grouping students by age or following up on problems. “It allows for more accountability for the student” she noted. “For example the driver knows who was sitting in a particular seat if damage is done.”

Regular use of charts can also help in overall student relations as drivers get to know student names more readily. “It’s always a great way to start a child’s day with a friendly hello” said Kaisha McCulley recent-ly promoted to assistant director of transportation for Exeter Township School District in Reading Pennsylvania. “Knowing their name makes it so much more personal.”

Assigning seating may also prove helpful in loading school buses especially at the end of the school day. “Seating charts help with head counts to balance loads” said Jeffrey Schwepker director of transportation for Fort Zumwalt School District in O’Fallon Missouri. “We can also move students apart and control the spacing.” Not to be overlooked is the potential to speed up the process of locating a given student. “If a student is missing we can contact seatmates” Schwepker pointed out.

The Safety Factor:

Perhaps most important is the potential impact of seating charts on student safety. “The fact that you can pull out a sheet of paper and know exactly where a student sits in seconds speaks volumes on its own” said McCulley who is a 2022 STN Rising SuperStar. “In the event of an accident some-times seconds count why not be prepared?” When it comes to serving students with disabilities seating charts may be regarded as essential especially in a situation where riders must be evacuated.

“The use of seating charts is a must if you take evacuation seriously” said Schmutz-Harden who leads evacuation training provided this month at the TSD Conference in Frisco Texas. She noted that some students especially those with disablities may need time and training to develop the skills necessary to exit the bus during an emergency and may require assistance from a more capable student. This means they might sit closer to each other. Or a student might be hearing impaired and need a seat closer to the driver to be able to hear instructions in an emergency.

“A driver and attendant should develop a proper evacuation plan with each student in mind” she continued. “Getting them off the bus in an emergency is even more important than getting them to school.”

Easy Implementation:

Options for use of charts range from the simplicity and low cost of paper to emerging high-tech solutions. At Exeter Township in Pennsylanvia paper charts are the norm. The sheets are numbered with the seat numbers for each bus with up to three lines per seat. “We just make them ourselves” McCulley said. “They’re basic but still have all the information needed to be easily understood by anyone.”

On Beaverton’s buses the simplicity of paper is complemented by masking tape placed above each assigned seat with the student’s name in black marker. Kindergarten and first grade students find this especially helpful Beaver noted. Drivers for Bend La Pine Schools use paper generated from routing software.

“We can fill them in for the driver from the student list assigned to their route through our system or we can print them blank for the driver to place students where they think it would be best” Crabtree said adding that the charts can be amended as needed by the driver. During the peak time of the pandemic she said that the sheets were covered with a plastic sleeve and drivers would mark student names on or off with a dry erase pen.

A fully electronic approach represents another option. For example digital seating charts from Tyler Technologies add flexibility and ease in updating that may not be possible with paper charts. Ryan Smithson a solutions consultant for the company explained that such features were expanded during the pandemic when the need for dynamic seating charts became more evident. Developed in tandem with the company’s mobile app for bus attendance the charts allow users to pull up the bus roster and seating chart for any run and record attendance on their phones.

Along with timeliness potential pluses include increased reporting and accountability capabilities easier access to historical data and an improved level of service to the community.

“Parents have a better experience when their child’s bus pass even includes their seat assignment” Smithson said. “It’s also better planning for the drivers particularly the substitutes we rely on now more than ever.”

Having the latest technology in place may also be a factor in attracting new drivers especially younger workers who consider phones their most essential tool.

Whatever the format charts may be worth considering for any districts not currently using them. Downsides appear to be minimal with the chief drawback simply the effort required to employ them.“It does take time to put them together” Ulrich noted “especially for a full bus.”

And language barriers can pose challenges for students who are learning English she added. But these factors are more than offset by the positive impact seating charts can make. Ulrich like others has become an advocate. “They are worth the time to put them together” she affirmed. “I encourage people to use them.”

FAYETTEVILLE -- John R. Tyson chief financial officer for Tyson Foods was arrested Sunday morning after a Fayetteville woman called police to report she returned to her home and found a man sleeping in her bed.

Tyson 32 of Springdale was arrested in connection with public intoxication and criminal trespass both misdemeanor offenses. He was booked into the Washington County Detention Center at 2:23 a.m. on Sunday and released at 8:39 p.m. Sunday on $415 bond. According to information from the jail Tyson has a court date of Dec. 1 on the charges.

Police were called to 445 N. Mock Ave. in Fayetteville at 1:48 a.m. on Sunday on a report of a burglary.

According to a preliminary police report a woman told police she returned home and found a man she didn't know asleep in her bed. The woman who wasn't identified by name told police she thought the front door had been left unlocked.

The woman gave an officer permission to enter the home and Tyson was found sleeping in a back bedroom on the first floor of the residence. His clothing was on the floor of the bedroom and the officer identified Tyson from his Arkansas driver's license.

The officer woke Tyson according to the report and he sat up but didn't respond verbally. After briefly sitting up Tyson laid back down and attempted to go to sleep. The officer said there was an odor of intoxicants coming from Tyson and his movements were sluggish and uncoordinated.

Tyson was arrested and taken to the Washington County Detention Center.

Tyson's address was redacted from the police report for safety reasons according to Sgt. Anthony Murphy with the Fayetteville Police Department. Murphy said the woman's name was withheld for the same reason.

According to information from the Washington County Sheriff's Office Tyson's address was listed as 5001 Greathouse Springs Road in Springdale.

Tyson was named as chief financial officer for Springdale-based Tyson Foods in September. He also is in charge of enterprise strategy and sustainability according to a company statement announcing his being named chief financial officer. He joined Tyson in 2019 according to information from the company.

A message left with Derek Burleson Tyson Foods director of public relations seeking comment on Tyson's arrest wasn't immediately returned.

That means the stock market will be open and so will banks such as Bank of America PNC Bank and Wells Fargo. The U.S. Postal Service will also deliver mail Tuesday according to its holiday schedule.

Most businesses will be open too although a few may alter their hours a bit. For instance outdoor goods retailer REI Co-op will delay the opening of its stores by two hours to give employees time to vote. Outdoor clothing maker Patagonia will close its stores offices and distribution center for the day and is giving employees paid time off.

TD Bank Group plans to finalize the deal in the company’s first quarter of 2023 which is between November and January according to TD.

TD announced an agreement in February to acquire First Horizon in a $13.4 billion all-cash transaction.

First Horizon deal:What TD Bank Group and First Horizon executives said in Memphis about $13.4 billion merger

Community investment:First Horizon announced $4B community investment in 2018. What's next after TD Bank deal?

“First Horizon shareholders approved the deal over the summer and we're now awaiting approval from regulatory authorities” TD Bank Group said in a statement Wednesday. “Teams at both TD and First Horizon are working together to ensure a seamless integration experience for our customers as we prepare to introduce First Horizon customers to TD Bank. We will provide more details on that when full regulatory approval is received.”

Once an agreement is finalized TD’s U.S. franchise based in Cherry Hill New Jersey will become a top-six U.S. bank and significantly expand its Southeast presence. TD plans to make Memphis a “regional” hub once the merger is complete.

First Horizon shareholders in May approved the $13.4 billion acquisition during a special-called meeting in Memphis.

If the transaction does not close by Nov. 27 First Horizon shareholders will receive an additional $0.65 per share on an annualized basis from Nov. 27 through the day immediately prior to closing. The transaction will terminate unless otherwise extended if it does not close by Feb. 27 2023.

TD has previously said there are no planned closures of First Horizon banking centers in connection with the deal. A First Horizon spokesperson previously said First Horizon’s frontline bankers will be retained through the merger.

Governor Tony Evers who supported the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) guidance that vaccines were the best tools to help stop the spread of the virus put an incentive program in place to help get more Wisconsin residents vaccinated against COVID-19. A program funded by the federal American Rescue Plan Act was swiftly put together by Evers’ administration. Residents who received their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine were mailed a $100 gift card.

The communication and outreach for the incentive program was done both through news outreach (e.g. press releases media interviews) and through vaccinators and community-based organizations working to ensure people had access to vaccines.

Gift Card Program Boosts Vaccination Efforts

“The incentive was for getting your first dose—to get individuals to initiate the vaccine series” said Sarah Deering the COVID-19 Communications Program Manager with the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS). “However we found that those who received the incentive were more likely than non-recipients to return for their second dose even though the incentive was not contingent upon that.”

Deering added “Data show that non-recipients of the incentive were twice as likely to be overdue for their second shot as compared to incentive recipients. Reminders for the second dose were done by providers/clinics based on their own procedures.”

Mark Silva COVID-19 Vaccine Administration Manager with Wisconsin DHS said “This program was developed very quickly—it was put together in less than 10 days—and was intended to create a sense of urgency and importance.”

Once Wisconsin DHS had the incentive plan in place they used multiple channels to reach patients and partners. “We advertised the program to our local and tribal health departments and other partners through our weekly vaccine program webinar” said Silva.

Health departments and providers used the state Immunization Information System (IIS) and their electronic medical records to identify and contact people eligible for the incentives and help plan for vaccination sites.

“The program was simple to implement” Silva explained. “We worked with our partner US Bank to offer a reward card that would be mailed directly to participants at the address they entered into an online registration portal.” Registrations were validated using the state IIS and confirmed participants received their cards in the mail several weeks later.

The incentive program was originally planned to run for 10 days but due to significant participation the program was extended for one month—from mid-August through mid-September. “We had over 80000 participants” said Silva.

Local organizations used the incentive as an opportunity to boost their own incentive programs. There were grocery and gas card incentives and other opportunities that made the state incentive more effective in some communities according to Ceri Jenkins the Planning and Implementation Program Manager with Wisconsin DHS.

Silva explained that the $100 amount wasn’t random. “We wanted to be careful not to offer too low of an incentive that folks wouldn’t be interested in receiving the vaccine but we also found that anything over $100 might make folks suspicious or feel like they were being coerced into getting something they didn’t want.”

How successful was the incentive program?

Rob O’Connell is Data Analytics Program Coordinator for the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Team with Wisconsin DHS. “We analyzed 76641 incentive recipient records at the state county and census tract levels” he said.

Wisconsin DHS found:

People ages 12–17 years participated at the highest level compared to their portion of the state’s population. They are only 8% of the population but 18% of all incentive recipients.

White residents participated significantly less compared to their portion of the state’s population; about 75% of recipients identified as White residents as compared to White residents making up 87% of the state’s population.

Slightly more of the Hispanic population participated than their portion of the state’s population; 8% of recipients identified as Hispanic residents while Hispanic residents make up 7% of the state’s population.

Several tribal communities had a significantly higher than average recipient rate including Menominee Bad River and Oneida.

“In the rural northern part of the state we didn’t have as deep a reach with the incentive but in southeastern Wisconsin we had a significant impact in communities that already had over six months to get vaccinated and had not done so” Jenkins explained.

“The incentive may have afforded people the ability to budget for missed work hours or other costs associated with traveling to get a vaccine” said O’Connell.

Silva emphasized the value of the incentive to families “If you’re looking at a family of five who are all eligible for the reward that’s $500 which can be used in many ways.”

Two years later where do Wisconsin’s vaccination efforts stand?

As of August 2022 Wisconsin is 23rd among the states with 66.7% of Wisconsin residents ages 5 years and older fully vaccinated which is close to the US average.

At the same time Wisconsin DHS indicates a large share of state residents are not up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines and less than a third of eligible people have received a booster shot. Yet for the ages 65 years and older group Wisconsin’s rates are higher than national averages with more than 83% of residents ages 65 years and older having received a first booster dose as of August 2022 placing Wisconsin third in the nation at that age group.

To get more people vaccinated Lauren Rieves COVID-19 Vaccination Program Manager for Wisconsin DHS was asked if the reminder/recall strategy was used. This strategy helps keep patients up to date with recommended vaccines and can help increase a clinic or organization’s immunization rates.

“We did not employ the recall reminder strategy at the state level” said Rieves. “There were local jurisdictions that sent out reminders through the mail based on immunization records from their data registries. Wisconsin encouraged our healthcare partners to do it on their own. Based on their records they can see if a patient is late for a second dose or a booster.”

Rieves added that more people need to be fully vaccinated. “There are some parts of the state like Dane County which includes the city of Madison and the University of Wisconsin where a higher percentage of residents are vaccinated as well as some rural counties and certain areas of Milwaukee where vaccination rates are lower.“

“While we can’t make anybody get vaccinated we can work to make sure the public has access to accurate information trusted messengers and data- informed messages. We do a lot to engage our broad network of providers and community partners.”

Working to Reduce Disparities in COVID-19 Vaccination

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted health inequities across the nation and in Wisconsin. Wisconsin DHS’s relationships with the state’s local health departments and 11 federally recognized tribal groups are key to addressing inequities.

Sarah Deering the COVID-19 Communications Program Manager said “The two-way communication that the response team and state DHS has built up with local and tribal health officers has been very important. There are regular meetings that continue to this day where local and tribal health officials can ask questions of the DHS communicable disease team.”

Evolving Communication Strategies

Working to reach as many audiences as possible remains a top priority. The department put together a digital media campaign regarding protecting yourself against COVID-19. “The average Wisconsinite saw a digital video ad from our campaign at least 10 times and the video was really important to reach Spanish language audiences. Parents were also very engaged with the video ads on social media” said Deering.

She noted that one particularly influential social media network was Pinterest which drove the strongest overall engagement across statewide audiences.

Yet Deering notes that significant challenges remain. “Information and pandemic fatigue exist so how do we communicate effectively and deliver information to the public so they can take action that is relevant to their lives?” She adds they continue to navigate through all the shifting attitudes and misinformation while partnering with trusted messengers and recognizing the range of attitudes toward government public health.

Tangible Results Bring Optimism

There are a lot of positives to come out of these two years. Rieves explains there has been strong relationship-building across Wisconsin. “The state is so much more connected with ‘boots on the ground’ and there’s significantly more cross-agency and cross-sector collaboration.”

Rieves feels optimistic now. “We have so many more tools in the toolbox with therapeutics test to treat and the vaccines… I think we are in a much better place to prevent hospitalizations and deaths. There’s so much more protection in place for our [public] health infrastructure.”"

Lyft will give voters 50% off rides bikes and scooters to get to the polls on Tuesday Nov. 8.

Riders will be able to access discount codes in every time zone specifically during voting hours for a discount of up to $10 by using VOTE22 which can be activated in the Lyft app.

""We believe that everyone's voice — and vote — deserves to be heard and transportation should never be a barrier"" the San Francisco-based company wrote on its blog.

Lyft created its Voting Access program in part due to an alarming amount of roughly 15 million registered voters in 2016 who cited transportation as the main issue of not getting out to the polls.

A 2020 study determined lack of car ownership was an enormous issue for Americans. Even more worrisome Lyft found that ""young people of color are 30% more likely to cite transportation as a barrier to voting than young white people"" according to a Harvard Dataverse survey.

In further efforts to assist historically underserved communities Lyft is also working League of Women Voters NAACP and other nonprofit organizations to distribute free ride codes.

Fellow ride-hailing company Uber tells PEOPLE it is focusing its efforts this year on supporting free rides for poll workers.

""Uber is proud to partner with Power the Polls to support our nation's poll workers with rides to and from the polls"" said CR Wooters head of federal affairs at Uber in a press release.

""Signing up to be a poll worker is a great way for eligible Americans to engage in civic responsibility and contribute to their communities"" Wooters continued in the Oct. 31 statement ""and we are excited to help make it as easy as possible for them to get to their assigned polling location this midterm election.""

There’s a fundamental lack of accessible standardized proactive education and resources exclusionary costs for egg freezing a broad lack of support for LGBTQ+ couples and antiquated egg donation and surrogacy programs according to Lauren Makler founder of Uber Health.

""If you talk to women who have experienced infertility or LGBTQ+ parents more often than not they’ll say they’ve felt failed by the process"" she said in an interview.

After leaving Uber Health in 2021 Makler wanted to start a new company in the reproductive health space and connected with Halle Tecco the founder of reproductive health company Natalist and Rock Health. Makler and Tecco saw an opportunity to create a new model for egg donation and make egg freezing more accessible. They brought on Arielle Spiegel as a co-founder and chief marketing officer and launched Cofertility to rewrite the egg freezing and egg donation experience Makler said.

Spiegel had created a prior iteration of Cofertility as a fertility education platform.

""So between the three of us we have Halle’s decades of experience building and investing in women’s health companies by founding Natalist and Rock Health; Arielle’s expertise in building some of the most beloved brands amongst Gen Z women and a fertility education platform; and my experience at Uber and building Uber Health. As co-founders it’s our life’s work to give women more power over their reproductive health"" Makler said.

Cofertility recently pocketed a $5 million seed round led by Initialized Capital and Brit Morin’s Offline Ventures along with a slate of female angel investors to scale the platform by growing its member base—both donors and intended parents.

The three co-founders built what Makler describes as a ""destigmatized scalable approach"" to egg donation which reshapes the cost structure of egg freezing. The company developed two services—a program that makes egg freezing more accessible and a donor matching program.

Cofertility matches women who want to freeze their eggs with families who could not otherwise conceive. With Cofertility's ""Split"" program women can freeze their eggs for free when they donate half of the retrieved eggs to a family who can’t otherwise conceive according to the company.

The company's ""Keep"" program allows women to freeze their eggs and store them all for their own later use while still taking advantage of discounts throughout the process to lighten the financial load.

""We see egg donation as a dramatically underserved area within fertility—and a linchpin for unlocking change across several key problem areas within reproductive health"" Makler said.

She added ""There's a lot of stigma around egg donation and that is largely rooted in the cash compensation model. It feels transactional impersonal and 'icky' for everyone involved: the donor the intended parent and the donor-conceived child down the line.""

According to a recent Harvard study of donor-conceived people 62% of donor-conceived adults think the exchange of money for donor gametes is wrong and 41% are “disturbed” by the fact that money was exchanged around their own conception.

""This stigma is an issue on multiple fronts: it discourages women from helping a family grow when that might be something they want to explore it leaves intended parents with fewer options and resources and it hurts the LGBTQ community that relies on egg donation for family planning"" Makler said.

The overall egg donation experience is also very antiquated and disappointing she noted. Intended parents scroll through clunky online profiles spreadsheet lists of donors or through services that overemphasize classist attributes and good looks.

There’s also a lack of ethnic diversity among donors which leaves intended parents without adequate options for growing a family that reflects their background Makler said.

The business of fertility treatments is soaring with analysts expecting the industry to reach $41 billion by 2026. The sector has attracted big investment dollars. In 2021 fertility support startups in the U.S. raised $345 million in venture capital up 35% from $254 million in 2020 according to data from Rock Health a venture fund dedicated to digital health.

All three founders had complicated fertility journeys and have a deep understanding of the problem they are trying to solve she noted.

""By bringing together egg donation and egg freezing in a thoughtful scalable way we address some of the key tension points in fertility care: the exclusionary cost of egg freezing the lack of socioeconomic and racial diversity among egg donors that prohibits intended parents from building the families they want and the antiquated egg donor matching program that feels transactional for both sides"" she said.

Cofertility has built a business model based on pricing that makes egg donation and egg freezing more accessible than the traditional donor matching system according to the company founders.

With traditional donor matching services intended parents pay an agency coordination fee they sponsor the cost of the treatment and then they pay a cash compensation fee to the donor. With Cofertility's model intended parents pay for the coordination and sponsor the treatment—but there is no additional cash comp. The company has developed empathy-led matching programs and offers additional community and educational resources Makler noted.

The company says it works with a range of clinics to support this model and all the clinics Cofertility partners with have to report outcomes to the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology and have a CAP-certified lab to ensure high clinical standards executives said.

Cofertility also plans to use the seed funding to develop more products and services. ""There are so many areas of fertility care and third-party reproduction that are in need of a more human-centered and accessible experience. We intend on building this out based on the feedback and demand that we see from our members"" Makler said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDEzbm93LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvdWJlci1hbGxvd2luZy1zYWx0LWxha2UtY2l0eS1kcml2ZXJzLXJpZGVycy10by1yZWNvcmQtYXVkaW8tZHVyaW5nLXRyaXBz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber allowing Salt Lake City drivers riders to record audio during trips,"SALT LAKE CITY — An in-app feature that Uber says is meant to improve safety for drivers and riders is coming to Salt Lake City.

The new element allows for both drivers and riders with Uber to record audio during trips.

When a trip begins riders and drivers can navigate to the ""safety toolkit"" in the app and begin recording. The recording can be stopped at any point during the trip and will automatically stop when the trip is completed.

Once completed the audio file is stored on the rider or driver's device and nobody will be able to listen to the recording including workers at Uber the company explained.

If a safety incident is reported Uber said a trained safety agent will review the audio and the information gathered will be used to help Uber take a course of action moving forward.

French multinational beauty retailer Sephora is laying down plans for continued growth in a crowded and competitive marketplace with multiple challenges. For starters the LVMH-owned business which has more than 2600 stores across 35 countries is relaunching in the UK this month.

A key focus is a twin expansion of Sephora’s physical stores combined with development of digital sales. Besides the UK accelerated global development in regions such as Latin America and Asia is underway. Sephora positions itself as “beauty’s playground” tapping into consumers’ predilection for small luxuries during a period of global economic uncertainty and is betting that now is the right time to bring that to new markets.



Speaking in London on the eve of Sephora’s UK relaunch Sylvie Moreau Sephora president of Europe & the Middle East who joined the company in the summer of 2021 from Coty laid out future plans. Since pandemic restrictions lifted she says “bricks-and-mortar stores are the biggest winners”. This effect has been especially pronounced in premium beauty. Data from retail monitoring company Placer.ai indicates that in August this year foot traffic in the US was up in the beauty and spa sector by 33.3 per cent on the same period in 2019. Some Sephora stores have seen increases in foot traffic as high as 45.7 per cent compared to the same month in 2020 data estimates suggest.



Foot traffic at competitor retailers such as Ulta Beauty and Space NK is also on the uptick. Space NK’s store revenues are up 15 per cent from before the pandemic. Financial services company Cowen estimates that Ulta has a bigger market share in the US than Sephora — 9 per cent compared with Sephora’s 6 per cent.

Crowded marketplace

In physical retail there’s more overlap than ever before between the brand selection found at premium retailers and drugstores — in the UK Chanel Dior and Givenchy’s beauty lines can be found at both high-end department stores and the pharmacy chain Boots for example. In the US Ulta has added more niche and premium brands such as Bread Beauty Supply and Drunk Elephant while big box retailers such as Target and Walmart continue to attract indie additions such as Starface and Lime Crime. In the UK Boots remains a powerful player commanding a 48 per cent share of the nation’s premium beauty market.

Sephora once stood alone with its appealing offer of indie and premium names and brand agnostic staff. Now it’s a more crowded field with more players jostling for market share. According to Moreau the exuberance of Sephora’s in-store experience including the opportunities for brand discovery can keep it in prime position.

“We see beauty as a celebration and we show up the loudest for that” she says. “In the store you will always hear music and we carry out our services in the middle of the shop floor not away in a little cocoon. We have a very extroverted voice.”

Brand incubator role

On top of the lively in-store atmosphere Moreau says Sephora wants to raise its profile as a significant brand incubator for indie hopefuls. She highlights the example of Huda Beauty which launched with a simple selection of false lashes in Sephora’s Dubai store and has since grown to become a billion-dollar business. Recently appointed executive vice president global chief merchandising officer Artemis Patrick is heading up much of this effort. Moreau says the company wants to find another “10 or so” very small brands and give them a launch platform with Sephora. “We are making big bets on these brands” she says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBldGEub3JnL2xpdmluZy9wZXJzb25hbC1jYXJlLWZhc2hpb24vdmVnYW4tcmV0aW5vbC1wcm9kdWN0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Care for Your Skin With These Vegan Retinol Products,"November 7 2022 by Rachel Harp Last Updated April 2 2024.

Creating a skincare routine on a budget can actually be a bit of a tall order. With products that may run $20 or more it can be hard on the wallet to purchase everything you may want for a comprehensive routine.

Then comes the unfortunate realization that some products may actually be a waste of money because they don't do what they claim they will. Talk about a headache.

The final shape is still opaque but one thing is clear for the region's aviation industry: All eyes are watching closely for how this transformation unfolds.

Twelve minutes. That’s all the time it took for the board of directors of Avianca the second largest airline in Latin America to set the fate of the carrier and begin a series of sweeping changes to the airline industry in the region.

The date was May 10 2020. It was a partly cloudy spring Wednesday in Bogotá where Avianca is headquartered. The weather however was likely of little consequence to the board that met via teleconference to decide the airline’s fate at 8:03 a.m. local time. Dialing or Zooming possibly in were its 10 directors including then chief financial officer and now CEO Adrian Neuhauser.

In front of them was a momentous decision: Whether or not to take Avianca into bankruptcy given as minutes from the meeting show the airline’s cash flows were “severely impacted by the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.” If they voted yes it would be the largest airline bankruptcy to that point in the crisis.

All of the facts in front of the board pointed to a yes vote. Global air travel was a month off its pandemic nadir in April 2020. Airspace in Colombia Avianca’s largest market had been closed since March 20 and the airline’s flights suspended since March 25. And then there was the “uncertainty caused by the limited visibility that the industry [had] with respect to the demand recovery.”

Just over a month earlier then director general of industry trade group the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Alexandre de Juniac had warned that without government aid to get through the liquidity crisis facing airlines the industry would “run out of cash and over half the [airlines] die.”

And the Colombian government as well as every other government in Latin America had to that May morning declined to provide any aid to the region’s airlines.

By 8:15 a.m. it was done: The board voted to take Avianca into Chapter 11 and the meeting was adjourned. By 1 p.m. that day the airline had filed the necessary documents with the court in New York and it was officially bankrupt.

“When we did it we saw no other viable path” Neuhauser said with the benefit of hindsight at the annual meeting of the region’s aviation trade group ALTA in Buenos Aires this October. “In retrospect it allowed us to survive. It gave us time to breathe. It gave us time to reflect on who we are and why we do what we do.”

Avianca was the first airline domino to fall in Latin America during the pandemic. The region’s largest carrier Latam Airlines Group would follow it into Chapter 11 on May 26 and Aeromexico on June 30 confirming de Juniac’s warning that airlines would collapse. But bankruptcy was not the death of these carriers far from it.

Latin America is emerging as the most dynamic region in the global airline industry a market through history that has been subject to the varying political and economic instabilities from country to country.

Today billions of dollars in fresh investment including from a slew of new investors is pouring in. Consolidation is rife. All of this change is creating very real and new opportunities for budget airlines and startups alike. The endgame from all this disruption is still unclear of course but make no mistake: Latin America is captivating the attention of aviation around the world.

Airlines in Latin America were struggling before the pandemic. The industry had racked up a combined $2.2 billion in losses from 2015 through 2019 according to data from IATA. When revenues dried up and many airlines saw “negative bookings” — when there are more cancellations than new reservations — early in the pandemic the resulting liquidity crisis proved the breaking point for many carriers.

In their initial bankruptcy filings Aeromexico Avianca and Latam all cited a liquidity crunch with as Avianca put it “no end in sight.” Each also mentioned the lack of government support as a contributing factor though none highlighted it as a reason for their respective bankruptcies.

“Airlines had to bear the brunt” Peter Cerda the regional vice president of the Americas at IATA said of the lack of state support for the industry in the region.

This was not necessarily a surprise. Air travel in many Latin American countries has long been viewed — incorrectly — as the domain of the rich and as such governments have hesitated to appear as subsidizing the airline industry. Of course exceptions exist most notably state-owned Aerolineas Argentinas; all of the major Latin American airlines including the three that went through bankruptcy were privatized decades ago. These views as far as airline executives are concerned contribute to government policies — from heavy taxation to failure to invest in airport facilities — that the industry argues limits its ability to expand.

At the same time each bankrupt legacy airline faced increasing pressure from budget competition. Viva Aerobus and Volaris were eating into Aeromexico’s home market; Viva Air was doing the same to Avianca in Colombia; and a combination of JetSmart and Sky Airline to Latam in Argentina Chile and Peru.

And conflating the issues facing Latin American airlines was the industry’s fragmentation. Aside from market leader Latam that was formed by the merger of Lan Airlines and Tam Airlines in 2012 no one carrier had more than a 13 percent share of passenger capacity — Gol in Brazil — and most had shares smaller than 8 percent in 2019 according to Diio by Cirium schedules.

Larger airlines with more scale are typically healthier and important to travelers grow faster than their peers in more fragmented markets. This has proven true in the U.S. and Europe where consolidation has created financially stronger airlines and airline groups as well as sustained growth.

Bankruptcy as Neuhauser put it in October was an opportunity for Latin America’s three largest legacy airlines to take a step back restructure and refocus on who they are. And in Avianca’s case that meant beating discount competitors at their own game.

“Staying independent in aviation in the 2020s is not an option. It was hard pre-pandemic. It’s not an option now.” Viva Air CEO Felix Antelo

If You Can’t Beat Them Join Them

Avianca CEO Neuhauser in several conversations over the past year has repeatedly highlighted the changes in the Colombian market. Growth he has said was in expanding the pool of flyers — converting bus riders to planes for example — rather than doubling down on the airline’s traditional corporate and upper middle class segments. And to tap this market Avianca had to cut costs become more flexible and adopt an a la carte pricing structure with cheaper fares and lots of fees.

In other words Avianca had to become a budget airline.

“We exist to serve the region we fly in and that’s everybody that needs to fly there. Not just the customer base that we originally had” Neuhauser said in October. “That’s what made us really change our business model because it means that to some extent we have to migrate our customer base to be broader.”

Bankruptcy brought big changes to Avianca. The airline’s CEO when it filed in 2020 Anko Van der Werff who had been brought in only a year earlier to lead its turn around jumped ship for SAS in April 2021. Neuhauser a former investment banker was promoted from finance chief to the top job. Under Neuhauser Avianca unveiled a restructuring plan to become more like its budget competitors while cutting costs by more than 40 percent and debt “significantly.” Its partnership with United Airlines was preserved and the U.S. carrier increased its investment in the new Avianca to roughly 16 percent.

But Chapter 11 proved to only be a starting point for Avianca. The airline unveiled plans to acquire its main budget competitor Viva Air in April. And less than a month later a merger with Gol to form the new Abra Group or a South American equivalent of Europe’s International Airlines Group (IAG). The Abra deal if approved by regulators would be the biggest change in Latin American aviation since the since the Lan-Tam merger a decade ago.

Abra would also include Viva Air and maybe Sky in Chile and Peru. Avianca and Viva Air anticipate Colombian approval of their merger by year-end and Avianca holds a convertible bond from Sky that it could convert to a 42 percent equity stake in the airline.

“Latin America as a whole needs to be more rational in dealing with the recovery” Gol CEO Celso Ferrer said at the forum. “If [airlines] don’t have scale if they don’t have let’s say market strength and presence it will be really tough for them.”

Ferrer like Neuhauser also stepped into the top job at Gol during the pandemic. Before taking over from Paulo Kakinoff on July 1 Ferrer was the airline’s chief operating officer. However unlike at Avianca the transition at Gol was expected and Ferrer has so-far continued with the strategy laid out under Kakinoff.

If one looks at the U.S. market airline profits grew and capacity growth accelerated after eight airlines merged to become the Big Four — American Airlines Delta Air Lines Southwest Airlines and United — between 2008 through 2013. Today each of those four airlines has scale with more than a 17 percent share of the U.S. domestic capacity Diio data show. The next tier of U.S. airlines Alaska Airlines and JetBlue Airways are significantly smaller with 7 percent and 6 percent shares respectively.

Abra’s four member airlines will operate a combined 22 percent of airline passenger capacity in Latin America during the fourth quarter according to Diio. Latam will fly roughly 23 percent of capacity.

And Gol is not a stranger to consolidation. The airline opened the current round of Latin American airline consolidation buying Brazilian regional carrier Map Transportes Aéreos for nearly $6 million in 2021. It netted lucrative slots at São Paulo’s close-in Congonhas airport from the deal.

Asked why the pandemic was the spark for Abra and the other consolidation talk in the region Ferrer said: “It was the need to have better market presence — a bigger market presence — better yields and more stability on the revenue side.”

“Staying independent in aviation in the 2020s is not an option” Viva Air CEO Felix Antelo said at the forum. “It was hard pre-pandemic. It’s not an option now.”

Antelo cited the “financial muscle” that will come from first the merger with Avianca that is pending in Colombia. The two airlines plan to maintain their own brands but will coordinate flights and other commercial activities. And second the larger deal to create Abra where Viva Air will be the “low-cost carrier branch” of the group as Antelo put it.

Spurned Suitor

“Consolidation that brings value to your shareholders and to everybody is true domestic consolidation” Azul CEO John Rodgerson said at the forum. He’s very much a proponent of these combinations citing for example the airline mergers in the U.S.

Where Rodgerson does not see value are in cross-border deals like the creation of Abra. “When you do cross border consolidation — it’s hard for me to see it’s not intuitive to see the synergies” he said.

But Rodgerson is a spurned suitor. Azul failed in a hostile takeover attempt of Latam last year; a deal that could have created a Latin American airline with a nearly 32 percent share of capacity in the region. And aside from Latam the only other domestic Brazil merger option for Azul would be Gol which is already spoken for with Abra.

Given his lack of good options it’s not surprising that Rodgerson is a bit glum on the idea of cross-border airline integration.

European airlines have shown that cross-border mergers can work. Air France-KLM IAG and the Lufthansa Group are all stronger than they were as independent airlines before consolidating over the past 20 years. Yes the mergers have not answered all of their problems — just look at the Lufthansa Group’s lackluster margins from 2015 to 2019 dispute having acquired Austrian Airlines Brussels Airlines Eurowings and Swiss Air. But all would agree: The three big groups and their constituent airlines are stronger today than they were before consolidation.

Latam for its part has doubled down on its status as the region’s largest airline. The carrier emerged from Chapter 11 in the U.S. on November 3 having slashed its debt by roughly 35 percent. Delta and Qatar Airways which owned 20 percent and 10 percent respectively of the airline before its bankruptcy both provided millions of dollars in new capital and kept strategic investments in Latam. And new investors including State Street and hedge fund Sculptor Capital Management also invested in the restructured airline.

Roberto Alvo CEO of Latam said at the forum that he expects the airline’s — as well as the industry’s — capacity to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels by next year. Latam has moved quickly to resume and add flights in Latin America’s domestic markets including taking — for now — Gol’s pre-pandemic title as the largest in Brazil.

And Latam is pursuing its own form of consolidation: A joint venture with Delta. The partnership will allow the two airlines to coordinate flights and other commercial activities between the U.S. and South America. This they say will allow them to expand including adding at least nine new routes in the market. The U.S. signed off on the pact in September however neither airline has said when they will launch the partnership.

Gol has a similar pact with American. The U.S. airline owns just over 5 percent of the Brazilian carrier. But for now neither airline plans to form a joint venture covering flights between the U.S. and Brazil as Delta and Latam have.

Azul has smaller partnerships with JetBlue and United. Rodgerson said the airline was not looking at a joint venture with United which owns a small stake in Azul currently.

Budget Winners

“The big winners [are] the LCCs in the region” Viva Air’s Antelo said referring to low-cost carriers another name for budget airlines.

Discounters expanded its share of passenger capacity in Latin America dramatically during the crisis. Budget carriers are scheduled to operate roughly 28 percent of capacity in the fourth quarter a nearly 11 points increase from the same period in 2019 according to Diio. No where is that growth more pronounced than in Argentina where discounters FlyBondi and JetSmart expanded their combined share of domestic capacity by 20 points to 32 percent in the fourth quarter.

The two Argentinian discounters have expanded into the hole left by Latam. The legacy airline closed its local operation as part of its bankruptcy in 2020. Aerolineas’ share of domestic Argentina capacity is roughly flat in the fourth quarter compared to 2019 Diio data show. But that growth is indicative of the direction of the market in Latin America towards a larger budget airline presence.

“The pandemic was good for JetSmart” the airline’s CEO Estuardo Oritz said at the forum. “[It was] a moment for us to get the airline to a much better level of performance.”

That better performance included tighter cost control adding new ticket distribution channels and the previously mentioned launch of JetSmart in Peru Ortiz said. In addition JetSmart signed a new strategic partnership with American that will include a small investment by the U.S. carrier. Ortiz said approval of the deal is taking longer than initially planned but the premise remains the same: Continue to grow but as part of American’s AAdvantage loyalty program.

JetSmart for now is focused on expanding its depth in its existing markets particularly Argentina and Peru Ortiz said. He does not see the airline adding new domestic operations in other Latin American countries in the near future.

Mexico was another market where discount carriers posted large share gains during the crisis. Viva Aerobus and Volaris expanded their combined share of domestic capacity by nearly 18 points to 77 percent in the fourth quarter compared with 2019 according to Diio.

The expansion of Viva Aerobus and Volaris was primarily driven by two things: First Aeromexico’s bankruptcy that limited its ability to grow until it exited Chapter 11 in March. And second the collapse of mid-tier airline Interjet at the end of 2020. Before it left the market Interjet operated nearly 17 percent of domestic Mexico capacity Diio shows.

Aeromexico as part of its restructuring doubled down on its traditional market that is corporate and premium travelers particularly in Mexico City as well as increasing connecting opportunities via its Mexico City hub. A partnership with Delta which saw its investment in the airline cut to 20 percent from 51 percent as part of the restructuring was retained. And Aeromexico raised nearly $1.5 billion in new equity and debt including from private equity firm Apollo Global Management which took a 22.4 percent stake in the carrier.

“We were headed down that direction already” IATA’s Cerda said of budget airlines’ pandemic growth. These airlines focused on expanding the number of Latin Americans who fly rather than taking passengers from the region’s legacy carriers. The pandemic accelerated this shift he added.

But even in a growing market not every airline will be successful no matter how low their fares. In Brazil startup discounter Itapemirim Transportes Aéreos survived for only six months in 2021.

Leading The Industry

What Latin American aviation looks like when the dust settles from the pandemic is still unknown. But an educated guess would be one that looks a bit more like Europe; one with a few large legacy airline groups — think Abra and Latam — complemented by a few large discount carriers. In other words: Consolidation.

This is what de Juniac and other leaders at IATA including Cerda suggested in 2020 would happen to the global industry as it emerged from the pandemic. That financially weakened airlines would look at combining as a way to financially recover and better prepare for the next crisis whenever it came. Latin American airlines just got there first.

“One of the long lasting impacts of the pandemic in the region will be accelerating — perhaps [by] two three to five years — the consolidation of the industry” Viva Air’s Antelo said. “Absent a pandemic that would have taken longer.”

Other regions are beginning to follow Latin America’s lead. In Europe the privatization of ITA Airways remains anyone’s guess with the Lufthansa Group back in the running with Air France-KLM. TAP Air Portugal has caught the attention of both Air France-KLM and IAG. And IAG also wants Air Europa and maybe EasyJet. Kenya Airways and South African Airways may partner to form a larger African group. And in Asia Korean Air’s takeover of Asiana is slowly winding through the approvals process.

But airline consolidation comes with its tradeoffs. In the U.S. for example budget airlines — also a growing market segment there — repeatedly talk of issues expanding into sought after airports from New York to Los Angeles and Chicago where large incumbents control the majority of available slots (the right for a flight to either land or takeoff) gates or both. This is something Latin American regulators must take into account as they look at the Abra deal and others that emerge especially given the region’s notorious underinvestment in airport infrastructure.

Latin American aviation does have one thing on its side: Growth potential. The number of flights per capita in most South American countries is well below the number in Europe or North America two mature airline markets. That plus continuing strong travel demand through at least the end of the year gives industry leaders some comfort in the future.

“There’s room for everyone” Copa Airlines CEO Pedro Heilbron said at the forum. “It’s a continent Latin America and the Caribbean of over 600 million people. It needs aviation. The distances are very long. So we think there’s room for all of us.”

And Copa which has long been one of the region’s most steadily profitable and largest airlines has managed to buck the trend avoiding both bankruptcy and consolidation so far. That Heilbron said will not change: “We try to do the same thing but better.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzExLzA3L3VuaXRlZC1haXJsaW5lcy1lbGltaW5hdGluZy1zZWF0cy1hcy1hbWVyaWNhbnMtZ2V0LWZhdHRlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,United Airlines eliminating seats as Americans get fatter,"One airline’s latest decision is weighing heavy on customers.

United Airlines’ flights are shaping up to most comfortable coach seating in awhile.

Between this month and April 30 of next year the airline will block off up to six seats on its fleet of Boeing 757s a company spokesperson told the “Live and Let’s Fly” blog.

The decision was based on numbers gathered from the Federal Aviation Administration that indicated the average winter weight of female passengers — including their carry-on items — increased from 150 pounds in 2019 to 184 pounds in 2022.

Meanwhile the average male passenger’s winter weight went up from 190 pounds to 205 pounds over the same time frame.

“The temporary change is a result of the increased average customer winter weights as prescribed by the FAA” a United spokesperson said of the temporary change.

“To be compliant with the current B757 weight and balance requirements United will block specific seats between November 1 and April 30 2023” it ended.

FAA numbers found that the average female’s winter weight has increased by 34 pounds since 2019 while the average male passenger’s winter weight has increased by 15 pounds. Getty Images

This sign will be placed on seats that are blocked off. Live and Let’s Fly

Blocked-off spots will always be middle seats in rows 16 to 40 to equally distribute passengers’ weight on every flight an official told the blog. A laminated sign will be placed on each seat that is off-limits.

Passengers’ physical bodies aren’t the only contributing factor to the uptick in weight. The FAA calculated that people are stuffing more in their carry-on bags — which are not weighed in the United States — thus increasing the overall heft of the cargo. Seasonal items such as winter coats are also considered during the colder months.

“Live and Let’s Fly” also noted that this policy was in effect last winter and was lifted by spring.

United and Delta pilots are even threatening to walk off on the job.

News4JAX aviation expert Ed Booth said the main issue is better pay.

“The airlines have returned to full profitability post-pandemic and their workers want to share in on the wealth. I don’t think it’s any more complicated than that” Booth said.

About 15000 Delta pilots voted in favor of potentially going on strike if a new contract agreement isn’t met.

United Airlines pilots also threatened to picket. The pilot union rejected a tentative contract agreement this week and now the airline is working on a new one with better rates.

American Airlines pilots remain in contract negotiations.

“They’re not just looking for more pay their looking for better working conditions” Booth added.

Booth said Delta Airlines makes up about half of the flights traveling in and out of Jacksonville International Airport.

A pilot strike could severely impact local travel. However Booth doesn’t think it is likely to happen at least not for a while.

“The mechanisms built into these systems allow for a number of 30-day cooling off periods and this would place this dispute well beyond the holidays” he said."
UPS,United Parcel Service,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzExLzA2L2lzLXVwcy1zdG9jay1hLWJ1eS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is UPS Stock a Buy?,"The package delivery giant's stock is struggling this year but its underlying business is improving.

Macroeconomic headwinds are gathering but the underlying quality of UPS (UPS 0.20%) earnings is improving. That's the key takeaway from the package delivery giant's recent third-quarter earnings report. So does it add up to make the stock a buy? Let's take a look.

Headwinds coming for UPS

A breakout of UPS' adjusted operating income by segment quickly gets to the point. As you can see below international package segment income fell in the quarter as a low single-digit increase in revenue was more than offset by rising costs. During the earnings call CFO Brian Newman conceded that average daily volume ""did not improve as much as we anticipated due to continued macro[economic] softening."" In fact the international package average daily volume declined by 5.2% year over year in Q3.

The disappointing performance speaks to the uncertain economic environment in parts of the world. China's growth for example faces challenges due to the government's zero-COVID policies. Meanwhile the European economy faces a tough winter due to soaring energy costs caused by sanctions applied on Russian energy.

It all adds up to an uncertain environment and the bull and bear debate around the stock continues. It doesn't help UPS that the international package segment is its highest margin business with an adjusted operating margin of 20.9% in the quarter compared to the U.S. domestic package segment adjusted operating profit margin of 11%. Consequently investors should brace themselves for some potential disappointment in Q4.

UPS Third Quarter Adj. Operating Income YOY Change Revenue YOY Change U.S. Domestic Package $1.69 billion 19.2% $15.37 billion 8.2% International Package $1 billion (9.4%) $4.8 billion 1.7% Supply Chain Solutions $0.46 billion 2.5% $3.99 billion (6.3%) Total $3.15 billion 6% $24.16 billion 4.2%

The improving quality of UPS earnings

The international segment has the highest margin but the U.S. domestic package segment has by far the largest revenue. For example the U.S. segment's revenue was $60.3 billion in 2021 compared to $19.5 billion for the international package segment.

As such moving the needle on profit margins matters more to UPS if it comes in the U.S. domestic package segment. Indeed the segment's adjusted operating income margin expanded to 11% in the quarter from 10% in the same quarter a year ago.

It's essential to understand why because the underlying improvement in the margin at UPS is the key to its investment case. In a nutshell UPS is undertaking an ongoing series of initiatives resulting in margin improvement. The guiding principle is CEO Carol Tome's ""better not bigger"" framework. As such UPS is focused on sweating its existing assets and making its network run more productively while demonstrating a willingness to be more selective over deliveries. As a result UPS isn't chasing volume for volume's sake. Instead it's focusing its business more on profitable deliveries.

The following chart of the U.S. domestic package segment metrics helps illustrate matters. Once again UPS reported a decline in average daily package growth. Yet a 9.8% increase in average revenue per piece resulted in an 8.2% increase in revenue and as noted above considerable margin expansion.

UPS is improving its margin by refocusing its business on key end markets including healthcare. (Tome confirmed UPS was on track for $10 billion in healthcare revenue in 2023.) Small and medium-sized businesses (SMB) are another focus; SMB average daily volume increased by 1.9% in the quarter and was responsible for 28.3% of total U.S. volume in the quarter compared to 27.4% a year ago. UPS' digital access program (DAP) provides SMBs with a suite of services to enable their e-commerce operations and management believes it will succeed in beating its target of $2 billion in DAP-related revenue in 2022.

Tome plans to continue driving the company forward by ""moving faster to grow in our targeted market segment"" and improving productivity by using initiatives such as digital technology to enhance delivery density and using smart RFID labeling to reduce misloaded packages.

A stock to buy

UPS is improving its underlying earnings quality and the margin progression in the U.S. domestic package segment is impressive. That said there's little the company can do about the economy and the international package segment will face challenges. Nevertheless if you're willing to ride out some potentially bad news UPS is an attractive stock to buy and that's likely to remain the case as long as the company demonstrates success with its transformational strategies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDRuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3Vwcy1kcml2ZXItbG9zZXMtc2F0LXRlc3RzLWJlbG9uZ2luZy10by10ZXhhcy1zdHVkZW50c9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDRuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3Vwcy1kcml2ZXItbG9zZXMtc2F0LXRlc3RzLWJlbG9uZ2luZy10by10ZXhhcy1zdHVkZW50cy5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UPS driver loses SAT tests belonging to Texas students,"article

UPS is apologizing after a driver lost dozens of SAT tests belonging to Texas students.

Local news outlets reported the back doors of the UPS track opened and the tests flew out of the truck.

According to KFOX the test sheets belonged to students who took the exam on October 27 at El Paso High School.

Many colleges and universities use the exam as a factor in student admissions.

The EPISD is working with the College Board to come up with a solution for the impacted students although taking a retest is not off the table. Students have also been offered to take the ACT another college entrance exam according to the news outlet.

""We have apologized to the school and extend our apologies to the students"" the company said in a statement to FOX Television Stations. ""Our employees worked to recover as many tests as possible. The driver’s actions in this case are not representative of UPS protocols and methods and we have addressed this with him. Safely and reliably meeting our service commitments is UPS’s first priority.""

One student spoke about his disappointment. Ezra Ponzio had taken the SAT test to improve his previous score.

""UPS just try your best to make it right with us"" he told KFOX.

It works like this: you receive a text that appears to be from USPS. In the message it says there was an issue with your delivery address. You click the link and it goes to a site that looks like the official USPS site- it's not.

The scammers request that you put in a new address so your package can be delivered then they ask for a $3 re-delivery fee.

""At that point yeah I knew there was a problem” said Tia Trevallion.

Trevallion received one of those texts in October. She clicked the link and entered her address but stopped short of inputting her credit card information.

“You just don’t know what they can do with that information” said Trevallion.

News 3 checked the official USPS site. They do not charge a redelivery fee.

“Don’t open anything as soon as you see where it’s supposedly coming from whether it’s a text email call the company directly and verify it"" Trevallion said. ""Don’t go as far as I did.”

To report the scam visit the Better Business Bureau website.

According to CHP on October 25 2022 a Home Depot Rental Fleet Operations Manager contacted the Central Division ORCTF and requested help in recovering five pieces of stolen construction equipment including front loaders and back hoes which was tracked to a community in Ridgecrest.

CHP said through investigative work by the CHP and Kern County Sheriff’s Office a search warrant was obtained for an address within the Ridgecrest community.

On November 1 2022 the CHP Central Division ORCTF along with loss prevention and organized retail crime representatives from Home Depot responded to the outskirts of Ridgecrest and located all five stolen items according to CHP.

As a result of the search warrant two persons of interest were detained and questioned.

CHP Investigators are continuing their investigation.

Anyone with information is asked to call the Central Division CHP office at (559) 603-7740.

Already have the ski and snowboard rentals taken care of but need some outerwear? Don’t worry we’ve got you covered.

Skiing and snowboarding are great at fighting off the winter blues. But if you are new to the sports buying everything you need can be daunting and sometimes expensive.

Renting is a great way to try gear out before committing which is why many shops offer equipment rentals. But what about apparel?

To make it easier for you this winter we’ve put together a list of five places where you can rent all the cold-weather layers you need.

Top 5 Places to Rent Ski & Snowboard Apparel

If you are lacking all the necessary outerwear to hit the slopes then Kit Lender is a great option. All you have to do is browse its snow and ski selection enter your dates and address select the kit and sizes you want and the team will ship your items free of charge straight to you (or your vacation rental or any FedEx ship center).

Kits start at $47 per day for adults and $22 per day for youth. And if you need to rent winter accessories like base layers socks or balaclavas they have those too.

When Don Ahern sits in his Ahern Hotel on Sahara Avenue on the north end of the Las Vegas Strip and looks across the street he sees property owned by Phil Ruffin – the Circus Circus resort and the Las Vegas Festival Grounds.

Ahern also owner of Ahern Equipment Rentals said on Nevada Newsmakers on Nov. 2 he considers Ruffin's property near his hotel as the ideal place to build a Major League Baseball stadium if the Oakland A's decide to move to Las Vegas.

""I think it would be great here"" Ahern told host Sam Shad.

Ahern said he recently spoke to members of the A's ownership who wanted Ahern's thoughts about building the ballpark near his hotel.

""About a month ago or six weeks ago now there was a lot of conversation about it (baseball stadium) and we received a phone call from the owners of the A's and they wanted to try to get to know us over the phone"" said Ahern.

""They said 'We're just doing our due diligence. We just wanted to know who the neighbors are and how do you feel about it (prospects of a new ballpark in the area)?

""And we said 'Sounds great to us. Welcome to the neighborhood'"" said Ahern who is also the finance chairman of the Nevada Republican Party.

Ahern said Ruffin has made trips to Oakland to negotiate a possible land deal. The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported in August that Ruffin was set to go to Oakland and that the Circus Circus/Festival Grounds site would be discussed.

""I actually have a little bit of knowledge on that particular aspect and there is no doubt he (Ruffin) has gone up there to talk to them on one or multiple occasions as well"" Ahern said.

Ruffin has undergone a change of heart about selling land to the A's Ahern said.

""But understand – it is just hearsay on my part I don't want anybody to take me for the absolute answer on this – but he (Ruffin) has kind of changed his heart in terms of he didn't want to sell originally. It was kind of holding back the A's but now he has decided to go ahead and maybe sell – a portion – but not all of it – a portion of the property.""

In August the Review-Journal reported that A’s President Dave Kaval acknowledged the team’s interest in the Festival Grounds early in the search process in Las Vegas. But focus shifted away from that location as the team’s market research progressed the R-J reported.

The festival grounds is almost 40 acres according to various reports. Circus Circus which Ruffin bought in 2019 from MGM Resorts for $825 million sits on about 100 acres.

If the A's move to Las Vegas the American League team reportedly wants to build a $1 billion stadium. It probably would have a domed or retractable roof and the A's are reportedly seeking some public financing for its construction.

The financing of the NFL Las Vegas Raiders' Allegiant Stadium included $750 million in Clark County room tax money but a 2016 special session of the Nevada Legislature was needed to approve it.

""Again I don't want to make enemies by saying things I don't know how to say but I heard he (Ruffin) was expecting to set (aside) about 22 acres for this project could be more could be 30 39 I don't know"" Ahern said. ""I had heard it would take 22 acres to get the A's satisfied for all of the space they need.""

The A's are looking for about 40 to 60 acres for sites they would own outright which would allow for mixed-use developments to go along with the ballpark according to the Review-Journal. The A's are also looking at smaller sites that would tie into a resort the Review-Journal reported.

The Circus Circus/Festival Grounds site is probably better than another site reportedly being considered – that of the Tropicana resort on the south end of The Strip Ahern said. The Tropicana resort sits on a 35-acre parcel according to reports.

""Seems like to me the Tropicana is a smaller property. It might be big enough"" Ahern said. ""Apparently it must be. It was the top option going there for a long time. I think we all kind of heard kinda felt like that is where it was going until this kinda changed his (thoughts) here about six weeks ago or so.

""So I don't know"" Ahern continued. ""Again it (Tropicana) would have to be torn down. This (Festival Grounds) is wide open. I just see this as a much better option.""

If the A's built at the Circus Circus/Festival Grounds area infrastructure improvements could help others in the area Ahern said.

""You know there are some big power lines that I would hope they would put underground and so it could also be an advantage for us here at the hotel because we don't enjoy those amazingly large power lines out front"" Ahern said. ""So some infrastructure would have to change around a little bit.""

The A's ballpark is not the only proposed stadium being discussed in Las Vegas.

Two billionaire business partners Wes Edens and Naseef Sawiris hope to bring a Major League Soccer franchise to Las Vegas and possibly build a 25000 to 30000-seat stadium at the intersection of Warms Springs Road and Las Vegas Boulevard.

Ahern encourages the multiple-stadium construction. Las Vegas is becoming a pro sports mecca with the NFL's Raiders the NHL's Golden Knights and the WNBA champion Aces.

Also Formula One Racing's Las Vegas Grand Prix is set for Nov. 16-18 2023 and the race has already sent room rates soaring for that week.

The nation's largest sporting event the NFL's Super Bowl will be held in Las Vegas in February 2024.

The National Basketball Association is also considering Las Vegas for a franchise. After a recent exhibition game in Las Vegas' T-Mobile Arena NBA superstar LeBron James said ""I want a team here Adam"" addressing NBA Commissioner Adam Silver.

""What is clear to me is that these younger generations younger than me are really involved in sports"" Ahern said. ""It's a sports world. I don't think there is any end to it. I think they can put as many stadiums as they want in this town and just keep on coming with it all.

""People from all over the world like to come to Las Vegas"" said Ahern a lifelong resident. ""It is an amazing city. You know when I was born here there were 10000 or 15000 people and now there's millions."""
UNH,UnitedHealth Group,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZWhlYWx0aGNhcmUuY29tL3BheWVycy91bml0ZWRoZWFsdGgtY29udGludWVzLWxlYWQtd2F5LWluc3VyZXItcHJvZml0cy1xMy1oZXJlcy1ob3ctaXQtY29tcGV0aXRvcnMtZmFyZWTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UnitedHealth continues to lead the way on insurer profits in Q3. Here's how its competitors fared,"UnitedHealth Group continues to lead the pack in profitability according to the latest earnings reports for major national insurers.

The company's massive profits certainly aren't going unnoticed. The ongoing expansion of the company's Optum subsidiary which has been a significant growth engine over multiple quarters is a blueprint that competitors are starting to follow.

In the third quarter UHG reported $5.3 billion in profit. It's next-closest competitor Cigna posted $2.8 billion in profit. UnitedHealth is also comfortably out in front on profit through the first three quarters of the year with the healthcare giant reporting $15.35 billion in profit through the first nine months of 2022.

Cigna also reported the second-highest profit through the first nine months of this year posting $5.5 billion.

UnitedHealth Group edges out CVS Health for the highest revenue through the first three quarters of 2022 reporting $241.4 billion. CVS Health posted $238.6 billion in revenue through Sept. 30 of this year.

CVS however wins the revenue battle for Q3 reporting $81.6 billion in revenue. UHG brought in $80.9 billion in revenue in the third quarter.

While CVS pulled ahead in revenue for the quarter the pharmacy giant did stumble on profit as it faced a $5 billion charge to settle ongoing allegations related to its role in the opioid epidemic. The settlement costs led CVS to post a $3.4 billion loss in the quarter. The company remains profitable through three quarters however with $1.9 billion in profit.

UnitedHealth's continued expansion is built largely on the back of ongoing double-digit growth at Optum particularly Optum Health which shows no signs of slowing down. Optum has been active in the merger space throughout the year and just days into the fourth quarter closed its biggest and most controversial deal of the year: its acquisition of Change Healthcare.

UHG executives have circled Optum as a growth engine moving forward with CEO Andrew Witty saying last year that he sees ""untapped potential"" in the subsidiary's business lines. The company is also seeking new ways to synergize the strengths of Optum and its massive health plan UnitedHealthcare to drive growth and lower health costs.

Cigna lands in third place for third-quarter revenue with $45.3 billion as well as across the first three quarters with $134.9 billion.

The insurer is on a similar journey as UnitedHealth Group as it looks to build out its Evernorth subsidiary which houses multiple key business including Express Scripts one of the country's largest pharmacy benefit managers; MDLive a telehealth arm; and eviCore which provides data analytics services. Evernorth accounts for a growing portion of Cigna's revenue and earnings and CEO David Cordani said Cigna is similarly looking for ways to align Evernorth with its Cigna Healthcare health plan arm.

Elevance Health formerly Anthem is fourth in revenue among the six insurers we analyzed posting $39.9 billion in revenue for the third quarter and $116.7 billion through three quarters. The company finalized its corporate rebrand earlier this year and is now investing to build out its Carelon business which includes its new in-house PBM IngenioRx as well as provider services and digital health tools.

Centene posted $35.9 billion in revenue in the third quarter and $109 billion in revenue through three quarters. Aside from CVS' loss Centene posted the lowest profits in the quarter with $738 million and is the least profitable insurer through three quarters with $1.4 billion.

The government market-focused insurer has spent much of the last year on its value-creation plan which aims to reinvest in its core businesses. CEO Sarah London has spearheaded the effort and the insurer redesigned its office of the CEO to reflect growing segments.

Humana has the lowest revenue for the quarter but beats Centene in profitability. The insurer reported $22.8 billion in revenue and $1.2 billion in profit for the third quarter and $70.4 billion in revenue and $2.8 billion in profit through the first nine months of the year. Similar to its competitors earlier this year Humana reorganized into two segments one focused on its health insurance business and then CenterWell which houses its senior-focused primary care and other provider health services.

Humana is now the country's largest provider of home healthcare services following its acquisition of Kindred at Home earlier this year and is investing heavily in its primary care benefits.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS91bml2ZXJzaXR5LW9mLW1pbm5lc290YS1zdWVzLW1pbm5lYXBvbGlzLWJhc2VkLXVjYXJlLW92ZXItY29udHJvbC1vZi10aGUtaG1vLzYwMDIyMjg2OC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,University of Minnesota sues Minneapolis-based UCare over control of the HMO,"The University of Minnesota is suing UCare claiming the nonprofit health insurer's proposal to expand its board of directors would lessen the U's historic influence at the health plan.

In a Nov. 1 lawsuit the U says adding board seats to the Minneapolis-based health plan would cause the university-appointed board members to lose the majority. The U-appointed directors might then be left out of key decisions the university argues such as charter changes that could terminate the U's right to receive UCare's net assets in the event of a dissolution.

UCare says the lawsuit is speculative and wrongly suggests the university was meant to always have the right to appoint a majority of directors at the HMO. The U has provided no evidence that it would be harmed by the changes being considered UCare says. Additionally the health insurer argues the lawsuit is effectively asking the court to re-write company bylaws to give the U more control — a move the board rejected in 2021.

""Unfortunately the University of Minnesota chose to intervene in discussions of UCare's independent board by filing a lawsuit aimed at trying to control UCare and targeting its reserves"" the HMO said in a statement to the Star Tribune. ""Our team is confident that we will prevail in court because UCare's legal governance documents clearly give the board the sole authority to make those changes.""

The case highlights divergent views on the University of Minnesota's role at the nonprofit insurer it created decades ago.

UCare was the fifth largest nonprofit group in Minnesota last year — and third largest nonprofit health insurer — with operating income of about $20 million on some $5 billion in revenue according to a Star Tribune review of financial statements.

Launched in the 1980s by the U's Department of Family Medicine the health plan is led by a 15-person board of directors eight of whom have some affiliation with the University of Minnesota.

As part of its lawsuit the university asked for a temporary restraining order and injunction to block UCare from amending its charter documents. Hennepin County District Court Judge Laurie Miller is scheduled to hear the request on Nov. 15.

""The steps UCare intends to take including eliminating the university's majority on the UCare board and undermining the university's role in UCare would pave the way for business decisions that go against the best interests of not only the U of M but Minnesotans"" the U said in a statement to the Star Tribune.

In its lawsuit the university cited three examples showing how it has used the current board structure to oppose certain changes being considered at UCare. The examples largely are redacted but context suggests the U opposed a 2017 plan for UCare to merge with Fairview Health Services as well as UCare's attempt this year to a win a managed care contract in Iowa's Medicaid program.

The academic institution alleges in its lawsuit that UCare has ""intimidated"" U-appointed board members and threatened they could face criminal and civil penalties for taking into account the U's interests. UCare called the claims ""baseless assertions.""

""The university created UCare more than 30 years ago to improve access to quality health care for underserved Minnesotans and to train physicians to provide care to patients in an HMO environment"" the U said in its statement.

""With this mission in mind UCare's reserves were built in large part by Minnesota Medicaid dollars. UCare's intended actions not only significantly diminish the university's long-standing role in UCare they jeopardize UCare's mission to use the assets it derived from Minnesota taxpayers for the benefit of Minnesotans.""

The office of Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said it is monitoring the situation and will attend next week's hearing. ""Recognizing that the public interest would be best served if the parties could avoid a costly public dispute the State vigorously advocated for the parties to resolve the dispute outside of litigation"" wrote the AG's office in a filing submitted Friday in the case.

Beyond managing care for Medicaid enrollees UCare also operates a large Medicare Advantage health plan and sells coverage to individuals through the state's MNsure health exchange. The nonprofit HMO also does some insurance business in Wisconsin.

In a court filing UCare acknowledged its historical connection to family medicine doctors at the U but cited a 1999 memorandum of understanding where University Affiliated Physicians-University of Minnesota P.A. relinquished its ""member interest"" in UCare — a term that's synonymous with ownership among nonprofits.

""Under UCare's bylaws the board acts by a majority vote of the directors except to amend the bylaws which require a two-thirds vote of the directors"" UCare said in a legal brief supplied by the insurer. ""At least three university-affiliated directors would have to vote in favor of any bylaw amendment for it to pass.""

In the legal brief UCare said the university asked the HMO last year to amend its bylaws and articles of incorporation to require prior written consent from a top official at the U for certain governance changes. But the health plan did not agree.

""Having failed in persuading UCare to change its governing documents plaintiff now asks the court to re-write them"" the health plan said in the legal brief.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaWNhZ29idXNpbmVzcy5jb20vaGVhbHRoLWNhcmUvd2FsZ3JlZW5zLXZpbGxhZ2VtZC1zdW1taXQtaGVhbHRoLWRlYWwtY2xvc2UtcmVwb3J00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walgreens' VillageMD buying Summit Health,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.chicagobusiness.com/health-care/walgreens-villagemd-summit-health-deal-close-report on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaWNhZ29idXNpbmVzcy5jb20vaGVhbHRoLWNhcmUvd2FsZ3JlZW5zLXZpbGxhZ2VtZC1zdW1taXQtaGVhbHRoLWRlYWwtY2xvc2UtcmVwb3J00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vamFjb2Jpbi5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS9taW5uZXNvdGEtYXR0b3JuZXktZ2VuZXJhbC1rZWl0aC1lbGxpc29uLWppbS1zY2h1bHR6LTIwMjItbWlkdGVybS1lbGVjdGlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,In the Minnesota Attorney General Race It's Consumers and Unions vs. Corporations,"One of the staunchest consumer protection advocates in America will face off against a corporate lawyer in an election on November 8 that could shape litigation against corporations nationwide. Incumbent Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison a Democrat has sued a major private equity landlord for failing to maintain rental units aggressively prosecuted wage theft led multistate actions to lower prescription drug prices and moved to block a major acquisition by health insurance giant UnitedHealth Group under antitrust law. His Republican opponent Jim Schultz meanwhile has said that if he wins office he will cut resources to the attorney general office’s corporate prosecution division. The thirty-six-year-old hedge fund lawyer has also called Ellison’s lawsuit against oil companies for deceiving the public on climate change “frivolous.” In a similar case Schultz claimed in a recent debate that Ellison went too far in prosecuting an egg company for tripling its prices early in the COVID-19 pandemic — while failing to disclose that the egg company’s CEO Beth Schnell had donated $2500 to Schultz this cycle the maximum individual contribution. The price gouging case was eventually settled by an agreement that the company would donate more than a million eggs to hungry Minnesotans. Ellison is facing an unexpectedly tight election in a state where a Republican has not won statewide office since 2006. While Republicans and corporate outlets like Politico Magazine and the New York Times have suggested the race is a referendum on crime and abortion given the office’s actual statutory authority the outcome of the election could have much bigger implications for Minnesotans on issues like health care and consumer and worker protections. If Schultz wins he has made clear that he does not intend to use the office to take on corporate power in health care housing and workers’ rights issues the way Ellison has. The candidate has never held political office and his employment record has largely gone unscrutinized in part because he has declined to disclose any information about his private-sector clients. The attorney who admitted he has no courtroom experience has spent the last decade working for law firms and hedge funds that have been active in the post–mortgage meltdown real estate market and in the subprime lending space. His donor list — which features maximum contributions from private equity lawyers and corporate executives as well as nearly $2 million in donations from the corporate-funded Republican Attorneys General Association — stands in stark contrast to Ellison’s broad support from labor unions and consumer protection attorneys. Meanwhile every single advertisement currently running to boost Schultz and attack Ellison is focused on crime according to data from AdImpact — even though the attorney general’s office lacks jurisdiction on the issue.

A Tale of Two Lawyers Ellison and Schultz have spent the past decade doing vastly different types of work and their backgrounds suggest the dissimilar ways each would likely approach the job of attorney general. Ellison has been a key player on the national political stage for over a decade. As congressman and cochair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus from 2011 to 2017 he fought to add labor and environmental protections to the Trans-Pacific Partnership the major Obama-era trade agreement and pushed for robust investigations into the financial instruments and the banks that led to the home mortgage meltdown. In 2017 Ellison unsuccessfully ran for chair of the Democratic National Committee representing the populist wing in a battle for the future of the party but lost to former Obama labor secretary Tom Perez. After being elected Minnesota attorney general in 2018 Ellison again captured national headlines in July 2020 for prosecuting the Minneapolis police officer who murdered George Floyd. Ellison has also played a key role in Minnesota and nationally as a labor environmental and consumer advocate leading and participating in multistate efforts to lower drug prices bringing an antitrust suit against the nation’s largest health insurer and backing and aggressively enforcing legislation to help win workers hundreds of thousands of dollars back in stolen wages. He also sued individual members of the Sackler family for their role in the opioid crisis sued oil companies for deceiving Minnesotans about the climate crisis and won settlements against internet companies for overbilling customers. In February Ellison sued one of the largest landlords in the state owned by a major hedge fund for failing to repair crumbling properties. “Systematically under-resourcing the upkeep of their properties and leaving many tenants in homes that are uninhabitable is a deliberate strategy to maximize and extract profit from Minnesota families” Ellison said in a news conference on the case. Meanwhile because Schultz has never held political office information about how he has spent the past decade is scant. He has not disclosed his private sector clients. As a result Schultz’s private-sector work has flown under the radar. After graduating law school Schultz worked in the real estate practices of two different corporate law firms — Kirkland & Ellis and Dorsey & Whitney. Schultz then moved to a real estate investment firm as an attorney. In 2016 according to his LinkedIn profile Schultz started working for Two Harbors Investment a real estate company founded at the peak of the financial crisis to invest in subprime mortgage–backed securities — the financial instruments that fueled the risk-taking activity that led to the home mortgage meltdown. The firm Two Harbors Investment later moved into the mortgage servicing business and build-to-rent investments. In 2013 Bloomberg News reported that Two Harbors — alongside private equity firms Blackstone Group and Colony Capital — was seeking to transform the single-family home business “dominated by small investors into a new institutional asset class that JPMorgan Chase & Co. estimates could be worth as much as $1.5 trillion.” That year Two Harbors launched a publicly traded real estate investment trust led by a former Goldman Sachs executive which was the largest such entity focused on single-family homes. Schultz was at Two Harbor Investments until 2017 and then moved to the hedge fund Värde Partners according to his LinkedIn profile. The Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party called on Schultz last month to disclose his clients from his hedge fund work but Schultz has not done so. Such information could be illuminating seeing as Värde owns or holds stakes in massive real estate developers mortgage servicers and consumer lenders. Between 2017 and 2021 when Schultz was at the firm Värde made major investments in mortgage servicing residential real estate and consumer lending. That included acquisitions of the fintech lenders Aplazame WiZink and Mercury Financial and the “buy now pay later” firm Genoapay. In 2021 Värde “announced it has provided more than $250 million of capital to purchase and fund the development of single family residential projects across three transactions in the U.S.” When Ellison has attacked Schultz for his work at Värde Schultz has pointed out that the Minnesota Pension Fund — which the state attorney general sits on the board of — has invested money with the firm suggesting that if the firm were so bad Ellison would have pressed the pension fund to avoid the investment.

Corporate Cash Versus Union Support While Schultz’s client list remains obscure his donor list provides clues to his allegiances since he has received numerous maximum individual contributions from private equity lawyers and real estate interests. Partners at Schultz’s most recent employer Värde are largely prohibited from making political donations since the state pension fund is an investor. Former managing partner Jason Spaeth however made a maximum individual contribution. Schultz has received maximum individual contributions from corporate lawyers at his former workplaces Kirkland & Ellis and Dorsey & Whitney and he has also received maxed-out donations from attorneys at the corporate firms Mayer Brown LLP and Robins Kaplan LLP. Schultz has furthermore received maximum contributions from individuals employed at various private equity and financial firms including Laxard Ascentis and Stone Arch Capital as well as health insurance giant UnitedHealth Group. But the bigger chunk of spending in the election has come in the form of independent expenditures or spending by groups that are not subject to contribution limits but are prohibited from coordinating with campaigns. Ellison and his backers — primarily the People’s Lawyers Project the state arm of the Democratic Attorneys General Association — have spent $4.2 million on advertising while Schultz and his backers have spent $3.4 million according to data from AdImpact. Top donors to the Democratic Attorneys General Association include the Progressive State Leaders Committee which supports progressive attorneys general as well as Amalgamated Bank which is majority owned by the Service Employees International Union affiliate Workers United. The association is also bankrolled by major labor unions including the American Federation of State City & Municipal Employees and the Communication Workers of America among other donors. The biggest spender boosting Schultz and attacking Ellison is Minnesota for Freedom which is solely funded by the Republican Attorneys General Association and has spent $1.8 million boosting him and attacking Ellison.

Here are the Republican and Democratic candidates’ positions on several health care issues.

U.S. Senate

Expanding rural health care

Mike Franken Iowa’s Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate grew up 10 miles away from the nearest town Sioux Center and knows how difficult it can be to travel to access care.

“I knew that health care was a necessity but we had all these little towns with a doctor or a clinic or a small hospital to go to” he said. “Today none of them do. This is part of the reason why so many rural communities are withering up and desiccating away.”

Franken said elected representatives in recent years have not done enough for rural health care and now it’s withering. He pointed to former Sen. Tom Harkin D-Iowa as one of Iowa’s most recent federal leaders to put forward long-term beneficial health care plans and policies for Iowans.

He said the U.S. health care system should care less about profits and more about ensuring people in rural areas have access to care.

Incumbent Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley has worked in previous years to create a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services designation to keep rural health care clinics a spokesman said. Under a bill he cosponsored with Sen. Bob Casey D-PA the Rural Hospital Support Act more hospitals and clinics across the country will be designated as Rural Health Clinics and receive extra Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement.

President Joe Biden’s administration is working on final regulations on the designation Grassley spokesperson Taylor Foy said. He said the bill is one of many policies that “have always been and will continue to be high priorities for Sen. Grassley.”

“As Finance Committee chairman Sen. Grassley successfully worked to support rural health care providers including supporting rural hospitals in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and making mental telehealth visits a permanent benefit under Medicare” Foy said.

Improving mental health care

Both Senate candidates say they are strong proponents of improving the mental health of Iowans.

Foy pointed to Grassley’s recent contributions to the bipartisan Finance Committee’s youth mental health discussion draft as a part of his health care policy focus.

“He is working in a bipartisan manner to ensure children with complex medical conditions are best served under Medicaid by getting them access to the right mental and physical health care providers” he said. “His Accelerating Access to Kids Care Act builds onto his 2019 Advancing Care for Exceptional Kids law by streamlining access to providers and ensuring care coordination is focused on outcomes.”

Franken said Medicaid should be accessible to everyone who needs it especially when it comes to paucity of mental health treatment options. Franken emphasized the positives of TRICARE the health care program for armed services members — retired or active — and their families and its outlook on mental health services.

Lowering prescription drug prices

Regardless of Biden’s October executive order to lower prescription drug costs both Senate candidates say they are concerned about the expense and its impact on constituents.

Grassley has worked across the aisle to lower prescription drug prices throughout his 40 years in the U.S. Senate and intends to continue if he’s reelected Foy said.

“He’s led several bills to hold accountable pharmacy benefit managers the middlemen in the drug supply chain improve access to affordable generics and provide price transparency among other bills” Foy said. “He’ll continue to advocate for such legislation and conduct oversight necessary to improve access to affordable medications.”

Specifically Foy said Grassley is working to pass the INSULIN Act to ensure the cost of the life-saving drug would only cost $35 per month out of pocket for people with private insurance.

Grassley voted against a similar proposal in August after Senate rules prevented Democrats from advancing it with a simple majority vote as part of a larger spending bill. So far this year there has been insufficient Republican support to bring up bipartisan cap on co-pays for insulin.

Franken said the need for lower prescription drug costs across the board is immediate and clear.

“I don’t think anybody ought to be paying more for prescription drugs than the Department of Defense does” he said. “That’s fair market value. Why would we be asking more money for people outside the department? I don’t get it … We have provided this disadvantageous position for the consumer.”

1st District

Republican Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks an eye doctor who is seeking a second term in the House wants to improve access to health care.

“As a doctor Congresswoman Miller-Meeks is keenly aware of the American health care system and well-positioned to offer solutions to help Iowans” her campaign manager Elliott Husbands said in a statement. “When she is reelected the congresswoman will continue to support and introduce legislation to lower drug costs expand access to health services and make health care more affordable.”

Miller-Meeks’ opponent Democrat Christina Bohannan said in a statement that she has traveled the district and has seen how many people lack accessible high-quality care for both physical and mental health. Bohannan a state representative pointed to the Blessing Health Keokuk hospital closure as one rural health casualty in the state that shows the state of Iowa’s health market.

The closure leaves nearly 10000 residents without emergency health care within 15 miles.

Keokuk is in Iowa’s newly redrawn 1st District.

“Such closures are far too common in the rural parts of the district and leave many without adequate access to care” Bohannan said. “In order to increase health care access we need to expand the number of health care centers in rural areas and prioritize increasing the number of mental health care professionals and resources.”

Bohannan also supports expanding Medicare coverage to include dental vision and hearing insurance.

The cost of prescription drugs is also on Bohannan’s mind. She supports capping insulin costs at $35 a month for Americans. Bohannan said no Iowan should have to make the decision between putting food on the table and paying for life-saving medicine.

2nd District

Liz Mathis the Democratic candidate for Iowa’s redrawn 2nd District and Republican Rep. Ashley Hinson both say they want to expand rural health care.

Mathis a state senator said she will continue her previous work to expand mental health care options to Iowans in rural counties.

“In the state Senate I helped develop the children’s mental health system that needs to be funded” she said in a statement. “We need mental health access centers in all counties like we have in Johnson and Linn counties. And we must work to recruit more mental health care providers so all areas of our state have access to the treatment Iowans need.”

Hinson is working to keep health care affordable for all Iowans and expand maternal health care for Iowa’s rural citizens according to a statement from a campaign spokesperson.

“She has co-led bipartisan legislation to expand maternal health care access for women in rural areas by expanding midwifery services access to freestanding birth centers and stillbirth prevention efforts” the statement read.

Hinson is opposed to any cuts to Medicare services. Mathis is looking to expand the program standing with Bohannan in suggesting dental vision and hearing insurance are also covered.

Mathis said she wants to keep the annual cost of insulin under $2000.

“We need to do more” Mathis said in a statement. “… We must bring generic drugs to market quicker. I also support extending the savings gained from Medicare negotiating for lower drug prices to Iowans of all ages.”

Hinson wants to continue sponsoring legislation to decrease prescription drug costs across the board if she’s reelected.

“She is a co-sponsor of the Lower Costs More Cures Act legislation that will lower prescription drug costs increase transparency in the system and help bring more life-saving cures to the market” a campaign spokesperson said. “She looks forward to expanding on these efforts next Congress and will continue working in a bipartisan manner to improve quality affordable health care access for all Iowans.”

3rd District

Rep. Cindy Axne the only Democrat in Iowa’s Washington delegation agrees with the other Democratic House candidates in supporting expansion of Medicare.

Republican candidate Zach Nunn a state senator told KMA News last month he opposes a public option for health insurance and he is against changing or eliminating Social Security Medicaid or Medicare.

Axne agrees with Grassley on the need for continued funding for the 9-8-8 national suicide prevention hotline.

Axne is one of the lead sponsors of the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act to reauthorize numerous youth mental health programs. That shows her commitment to mental health care expansion Communications Director Paige Godden said in a statement.

“(It) passed the House as part of a larger mental health package in June 2022” Godden said. “Rep. Axne hopes to continue addressing this matter by supporting legislation that expands the mental health workforce in rural areas and strengthens the implementation of the new mental health crisis hotline 9-8-8.”

Nunn wants to see Iowa’s approach to mental health care replicated on a nationwide scale. He also supports transparency from drug manufacturers and companies in their pricing.

“That means making sure your local pharmacist has access to not only telemedicine like we did here in Iowa but you truly know the cost of what both the patient and the provider or doctor in this case are paying” he said to KMA News “so that the insurance companies can’t run away and jack up prices well beyond what the costs of drugs are.”

Both candidates say they would work to reduce prescription drug costs. Nunn has said he plans to reach across the aisle to lower costs across the board according to the Des Moines Register.

“Families are struggling to afford health care due to out-of-control prescription drug prices” he said according to the Register. “In Congress I would work across the aisle to lower the cost of prescription drugs to help patients families and providers. As proven by work in Iowa both sides can work together to stop price gouging foster innovation and ensure access for our rural and urban communities.”

During her time in Congress since 2019 Axne has voted for the Inflation Reduction Act which will cap insulin prices for Medicare beneficiaries at $35 a month and reduce drug costs by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices with manufacturers. Godden said Axne would continue her support for lowering costs.

“These changes are historic and are expected to lower the cost of prescription drugs filled by Medicare beneficiaries in Iowa’s 3rd District by an estimated $34 million” Godden said. “Still there is more to be done. Rep. Axne plans to take further action by addressing the role that pharmacy benefit managers play in inflating drug costs getting safe generics on the market faster and limiting the amount that pharmaceutical companies can charge for life saving drugs.”

4th District

Rep. Randy Feenstra the Republican incumbent seeking reelection in Iowa’s 4th District told the Des Moines Register in October he wants to prioritize mental health treatment as a part of addressing gun violence.

“I also voted for the Restoring Hope for Mental Health and Well-Being Act which expands mental health resources for our families and schools” he told the Register. “I’ll continue to work to deliver mental health resources for our communities and protect our children from unspeakable tragedies while also protecting Iowans’ constitutional Second Amendment rights.”

Ryan Melton the Democratic candidate for the 4th District said rural health care is a concern of his as he runs for office.

“We’re facing a massive mental health care availability crisis” he said. “A lot of countries in our district don’t have a single OBGYN and a lot of rural hospitals are facing immense financial pressure. A big reason for that is because the private insurance system puts up so many obstacles between patient and provider and that leaves out health care providers in a tenuous position where they struggle to keep the doors open.”

Melton is a proponent of a universal health care plan and would want to work toward that if he’s elected.

“I definitely am a believer in a Medicare for all single payer universal health care option” he said. “… As far as with privatization in the state I’m certainly not in favor of that and we’ve seen a big increase in the number of denied claims that really are impacting our most vulnerable Iowans.”

At the federal level Melton said he wants to stop privatization since it leads to the same issues.

During Feenstra’s first campaign in 2020 he said in an interview with Iowa Capital Dispatch that Iowa needs to create competition in health care. He said he supported the Affordable Care Act’s protection of individuals with preexisting conditions but the bill needed to be eliminated.

“Government-run health care through Medicare isn’t working” Feenstra said. “All of a sudden you have the government making decisions on who gets the new hip. That should never be what health care is about.”

He stood by these beliefs in a Radio Iowa interview in October 2021. He also told Radio Iowa he believes lowering the cost of medications is a big concern that should be addressed at the state and federal level.

Melton agrees that lowering prescription drug costs is a top priority.

“The cost of medical care is way too high in general” he said. “The upcharges we’re seeing on very basic services if you go to the hospital are astronomical. We clearly need to do more as far as capping vital prescription drugs and addressing price gouging in the prescription drug space now.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cmVwdWJsaWMuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMTY4NDUzL21lZGljYXJlLW5vdC1lbm91Z2gtaGVhbHRoLWNvbW11bmlzbS1ib29rLXJldmlld9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Medicare for All Is Not Enough,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cmVwdWJsaWMuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMTY4NDUzL21lZGljYXJlLW5vdC1lbm91Z2gtaGVhbHRoLWNvbW11bmlzbS1ib29rLXJldmlld9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF1847820>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cmVwdWJsaWMuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMTY4NDUzL21lZGljYXJlLW5vdC1lbm91Z2gtaGVhbHRoLWNvbW11bmlzbS1ib29rLXJldmlld9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vamFtYWljYS1nbGVhbmVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvMjAyMjExMDYvaGVhbHRodGVjaC10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWZhY2lsaXRhdGluZy11bml2ZXJzYWwtaGVhbHRoLWNvdmVyYWdl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Health+Tech | Technology facilitating universal health coverage | News,"The recent Caribbean Conference on Healthcare Financing held in Antigua has placed the discussion of universal health coverage and health financing squarely on the table of Caribbean countries again but this time with more emphasis on the role technology can play to facilitate this process.

This is a much-welcomed approach as the power of technology to fuel the development of the healthcare sector has been long discussed but slow to implement.

Health financing is a major prong within the care system that will help to facilitate universal access. Health insurance is the number one way in which we currently finance healthcare both public and private. In fact a few years ago the Government put forward plans to implement a National Health Insurance Plan that would be managed through the National Health Fund – an important move towards universal access to healthcare. It means therefore that if the Caribbean as a collective can improve this process we will be taking important steps towards universal access regionally.

Currently Jamaica is ahead of most countries where processing health claims is concerned. We are one of few that have online real-time electronic-claims processing. The advantages of that are many and include increased efficiency and cost saving immediate-claims settlement better service delivery for patients and improved ability to plan and finance the medical practice and hospital.

If we truly want the health integrations we desire as a united Caribbean countries must look to start by implementing electronic claims processing with interoperability or via the same system that can work for everyone. Once we have achieved this then we already have at least one way to finance health effectively outside of the other methods including taxation government funding and the least desirable – out of pocket payments. All of these are currently being employed throughout the health sector. We can now look at implementing the other necessary inputs needed for universal coverage.

This is where the technology comes in. Two important factors of the many objectives of universal health coverage are to ensure that the entire population has access to health services and that they can do so without being financially compromised.

The right combination of funding mechanisms will ensure the latter while the integration of technology in every aspect of healthcare will ensure the former. Apart from improved healthcare access technology in health can also result in increased efficiency of operations via automation improved data management and decision support improved diagnosis and treatment fraud reduction/elimination and cost reduction.

Technology can create a health system that is responsive to the needs of the population and sensitive to the environment in which it serves.

A study entitled Technology and Universal Health Coverage: Examining the Role of Digital Health done by Wilson Sheikh Gorgens Ward and the World Bank and published in November 2021 in the Journal of Global Health indicated that “the health sector by its very nature of being data intensive lends itself to the use of technology for analytics to improve health outcomes respond to public-health crises and efficiently and equitably allocate resources.”

This is precisely what we need for a system in which the focus will be on the overall health of every member of the population in a holistic way and not just on treating diseases. The data will also help us to plan and forecast public-health events. In this regard an integrated Caribbean health network would be ideal where support and resource sharing would benefit each country given our small and vulnerable economies.

“In addition to supporting good health and well-being universal health coverage also contributes to social inclusion gender equality poverty eradication economic growth and human dignity.” – World Health Statistics 2022 – Monitoring Health for the [SDGs] Sustainable Development Goals World Bank. Technology can be used to make this a reality.

We already have the tools necessary to achieve this in every aspect of care. The electronic medical practice systems currently being used in Jamaica include medical dental optical pharmacy radiology diagnostics lab telemedicine and electronic prescription.

Most of these are already linked through the insurance system. This means that we possess the various linkages on the healthcare chain that can ‘talk’ to each other to enable a comprehensive system that can be used throughout the Caribbean.

Together these five organizations represent more than 41 million health professionals worldwide and assemble essential knowledge and experience from the key health professions in more than 130 countries.

Today’s signing ceremony represents an historic event bringing together the five global organizations representing the world’s dentists pharmacists nurses physiotherapists and physicians with WHO to enhance their joint collaboration on protecting and investing in the health workforce to provide safe quality and equitable care in all settings.

“There is no health without health workers” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “With this MoU WHPA and WHO will support health care professional associations and governments to protect and invest in the multi-disciplinary teams of health workers needed to deliver essential health services and prevent and respond to emergencies.”

The new MoU reflects the importance of investing in the health workforce through a multi-stakeholder integrated approach. It provides a framework for joint action between the five organizations and the WHO. They specifically commit to collaborate on priority health workforce issues as well as universal health coverage noncommunicable diseases and ageing populations. The framework will also contribute to reinforcing national and regional health systems and services.

“The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us that today’s public health problems cannot be solved by one country or one organization or one profession by itself” said Enzo Bondioni Chair of the WHPA and Executive Director of FDI. “Through collaboration between stakeholders we can tackle interlinked global health challenges by taking joint action to protect and strengthen the health workforce and make progress towards universal health coverage.”

The WHPA and WHO have pursued common goals prior to and through the pandemic. Both have worked to ensure vaccination of health and care workers across all countries and continued advocacy with countries to strengthen health systems including by providing better recognition workplace environments and decent working conditions for health and care workers."

Hasta el mes de octubre el número acumulado de unidades vendidas por Nissan fue de 131 mil 730 apenas nueve unidades por encima de las 131 mil 721 colocadas por GM durante el mismo período según datos del Resultados del Registro Administrativo de la Industria Automotriz de Vehículos Ligeros (RAIAVL) del Instituto NAcional de Estadística y Geografía (Inegi).

Con un empate técnico a solo dos meses del cierre del año 2022 podría convertirse en la primera ocasión desde 2008 -en plena crisis económica- que la japonesa pierda la corona del mercado nacional nuevamente frente a su competidora estadounidense que terminaría por convertirse en la campeona total del sector pues ya ostenta los títulos de mayor productor y exportador de vehículos del país.

El éxito de la empresa de autos estadounidense no ha sido exclusivo de México pues en la presentación de los resultados del corporativo durante el tercer trimestre de 2022 la empresa informó de un incremento en sus ingresos al pasar de 26 mil 800 millones de dólares en 2021 hasta los 41 mil 900 millones de dólares en 2022 -56% más- mientras su beneficio neto ascensión a 3 mil 300 millones de dólares frente a los 2 mil 400 millones de un año antes.

Los malos resultados de la compañía japonesa no son nuevos a nivel global. Según los datos de ventas globales ofrecidos por la empresa a sus inversionistas desde 2017 cuando se colocaron 5.77 millones de vehículos las ventas se han reducido año tras año hasta que en 2021 el resultado fue de 3.8 millones 33% menor al del pico.

Bimestre que definirá el liderazgo en ventas

Aunque General Motors le pisa los talones a Nissan su caída en la carrera de 2022 aún no es inminente.

En abril GM superó por primera vez en ventas mensuales a Nissan en este año pero la verdadera racha que ha arrastrado a Nissan tan cerca de su competidora comenzó a mediados de este año cuando en el mes de julio GM vendió muchos más autos (GM-13745 vs Nissan-9383) tendencia que no se ha detenido hasta octubre cuando la estadounidense vendió 13408 vehículos seguido por Nissan con 10866.

El repunte de General Motors sorprende luego de que en 2021 fuera -por mucho- la empresa más afectada por la crisis de semiconductores que implicó 166 días de paro que redujeron en (-)28.9% las unidades producidas en comparación a Nissan con solo 24 días de paro y un ligero incremento de (+)2.8% en su producción total del año.

Pero ahora los papeles se han invertido. Mientras las ventas acumuladas de General Motors crecieron 24.1% y su producción 30.5% en la automotriz japonesa las ventas cayeron (-)23.4% y su producción (-)29.8% lo que expresa una fuerte correlación entre la producción y las ventas para explicar ambos casos.

Específicamente en el caso de Nissan el cierre de su línea 1 de producción -destinado al ensamblaje de sus populares modelos Versa y V-Drive- en su fábrica de la Ciudad Industrial del Valle de Cuernavaca (CIVAC) puede estar detrás de parte de las disminuciones en los niveles de producción de la japonesa.

Si bien ambos modelos se siguen produciendo en su planta de Aguascalientes -donde la empresa anunció se concentrará el ensamblaje- apenas en mayo se anunció la inversión de 700 millones de dólares para la modernización de dicha planta por lo que el aumento de la capacidad productiva para suplir la extinta línea 1 de CIVAC apenas estaría en proceso.

Otras firmas que registraron avances significativos en sus niveles de producción fueron Ford Toyota Kia y Audi que produjeron (+)39.7 (+)26.4 (+)21.2% y (+)20.6% más respectivamente. Por otro lado en las contracciones registradas destacan además de Nissan la alemana BMW con (-)11.8% y la también japonesa Honda con (-)10.%.

La crisis de los semiconductores ha seguido cobrando días de paro que aunque se han dado en mucho menor medida no han dado respiro suficiente a la industria para que siquiera se acerque a sus cifras prepandemia pero irónicamente esto podría convertirse en la última curva que Nissan tendría que sortear para ganar la carrera en 2022.

A la publicación de esta nota Nissan acumulaba 46 días de paro mientras GM alcanzó 51 con planes de detener considerablemente más días las producción en algunas de sus armadoras como en San Luis Potosí donde los trabajadores han adelantado que el paro podría extenderse hasta el 9 de diciembre.

De confirmarse o incluso aumentar el número de fábricas de GM que entrarían en paro durante el último tramo y descartarse nuevos paros en la empresa japonesa Nissan podría mantenerse como el primer lugar en el podio sin embargo no lo haría por un aumento de producción sino por la disminución de su competidor.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vY25uZXNwYW5vbC5jbm4uY29tL3ZpZGVvL2Nhbm5hYmlzLWV4cG8tYXJnZW50aW5hLXZlbnRhLWxlZ2FsLXNlbWlsbGFzLXBsYW50YXMtY25uLXByaW1lcmEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Comienza la venta legal de semillas y plantas de cannabis en Argentina,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='cnnespanol.cnn.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /video/cannabis-expo-argentina-venta-legal-semillas-plantas-cnn-primera/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF19F0130>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vY25uZXNwYW5vbC5jbm4uY29tL3ZpZGVvL2Nhbm5hYmlzLWV4cG8tYXJnZW50aW5hLXZlbnRhLWxlZ2FsLXNlbWlsbGFzLXBsYW50YXMtY25uLXByaW1lcmEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Shareholders of U.S. telecommunications giant Verizon Communications (VZ 0.79%) have had a tough year. Typically a defensive stock that isn't too volatile Verizon's down 40% from its high and has fallen more than the S&P 500 in 2022. The company pays a juicy dividend that yields 7% at today's share price a tempting prize for retirees and dividend investors.

So what gives? I'll dive into Verizon's struggles to determine whether investors should be worried about Verizon's dividend checks clearing anytime soon. Ultimately buying the stock is a decision that could come down to your situation.

Falling behind the competition

The telecommunications industry in the U.S. is an oligopoly which means that a tiny group of companies dominate the market. In this case Verizon AT&T and T-Mobile US serve most wireless users. You can compare the companies to see how well they're doing against each other. Most consumers in America have cellphones and hop between carriers over time.

You can trace Verizon's slumping share price to its struggles with subscriber growth throughout this year. After nine months Verizon lost 16000 wireless subscribers this year. So where did they go? Over to the competition. AT&T added 1.7 million net subscribers over the same time frame and T-Mobile added 1.1 million. AT&T and T-Mobile are adding more than Verizon lost so it's not all at Verizon's expense. However it's clear that people aren't choosing Verizon whether they're switching from a discount carrier or one of the big three or are just a new cellphone user.

Wireless networks are price competitive so subscriber growth is notable in driving revenue growth. Verizon's stalling in subscriber additions could foreshadow weak growth down the line and is probably at least a reason why the stock has fallen out of favor on Wall Street.

About that dividend

Verizon isn't a rapidly growing company to begin with but it generates gobs of cash profits that fund a generous dividend. The hyper-yield currently at 7% is a big reason many investors own shares. Verizon has raised that dividend for 18 consecutive years and seems poised to continue becoming a Dividend Aristocrat.

You can see below that even in a year where operating profits are down year to date from $31.2 billion to $28.2 billion and increased capital spending has further reduced free cash flow Verizon still has $4.3 billion in cash left after paying the dividend.

Investors should watch to see if free cash flow continues dropping in the quarters ahead but it seems that the dividend faces no danger at present. So you can sleep pretty well at night having the stock's 7% yield in your portfolio.

Is it time to buy?

Whether Verizon is a buy today depends on your situation. For example investors looking to maximize income on their investments can buy Verizon for its well-funded dividend. But it's a more challenging question if you're looking for total returns which include a rising share price. Verizon is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of just 8 well below its typical valuation over the past decade (P/E of 13).

That would leave room for solid investment returns if the market's sentiment toward Verizon increased and pushed the valuation. However it's hard to see that happening without the company's subscriber growth getting back on track first. If you're trying to put your money into the best total return opportunity there might be better options in a market where everything is selling off.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNndWlkZS5jb20vbmV3cy9pcGhvbmUtMTQtZGVsaXZlcnktZGF0ZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,iPhone 14 delivery dates Apple AT&T T-Mobile Verizon and more,"The iPhone 14 is here but it may not arrive at your door for quite a few weeks yet.

The fact that the iPhone 14 particularly the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are selling well is not a shock. But what may be an unpleasant surprise is that if you order now your new phone could take weeks to arrive. And that may only get worse thanks to recent lockdowns at Apple's main production plant in China.

If you've not placed your iPhone 14 order yet and are wondering just when you can expect an iPhone to drop through your letterbox we've collected the latest shipping data from Apple's own website here.

That way you can figure out when it's best to stay at home in case of delivery or if it will make it in time for an important date like someone's birthday or your next holiday.

As it stands it looks like pretty much every version of the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max is now on backorder until October or early November. It doesn't matter which color you pick or how much storage you spec you're going to be waiting at least a month for a new Pro iPhone and perhaps as long as six weeks if you want the bigger iPhone 14 Pro Max variant.

Walmart's selection of iPhone 14 models seems to currently be in Limbo. While most versions of the iPhone 14 14 Plus 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max are listed as in stock most don't have specific arrival dates. We'll be sure to update you when this changes but for now be careful if you try to buy any iPhone 14 through Walmart.com.

Julian Edelman Joins Cecily Strong In Hilarious Verizon Google Pixel Commercial

Putting sports stars in commercials is a tried and true method to sell just about anything. The famous 1979 commercial featuring a young fan giving ""Mean"" Joe Greene his coke and Greene tossing the young man his jersey remains probably the most iconic sports-themed commercial in history so much so that Coke later parodied itself with a new version of the ad for Coke Zero starring a more recent Pittsburgh Steelers great Troy Polamalu. Some commercials are better than others though.

While the commercial where Larry Bird and Michael Jordan have a shootout for a Mcdonald's sandwich may be fondly remembered another commercial where Bird as a coach tries to distract Grant Hill during a game by putting Mcdonald's fries everywhere in the stadium is not remembered as fondly and the commercial made Ball is Life's list of the most painful Grant Hill commercials from the '90s.

Former New England Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman hasn't done as many commercials as some other athletes but he has done a few. In a hilarious 2016 commercial for UGG for Men Edelman and his long-time teammate Tom Brady are hanging out when Edelman decides he's bored and finds a number of annoying activities to do around Brady while the seven-time Super Bowl champion sits quietly watching him. In 2022 Edelman took to Instagram to post a hilarious re-edit of Denver Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson's Subway commercial in which Wilson asks ""Have you ever done anything dangerous?"" In Edelman's re-edit the wide receiver responds with ""Yeah I bet on you tonight.""

In Edelman's latest commercial he's teamed up with ""Saturday Night Live"" cast member Cecily Strong to make a lot of jokes about cellular reception.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHA6Ly9rb3JlYWJpendpcmUuY29tL3N5bmNocm9ub3NzLWFkb3B0cy12ZXJpem9ucy1uZXh0LWdlbmVyYXRpb24tcHJpdmF0ZS1jbG91ZC1pbmZyYXN0cnVjdHVyZS8yMzI5MzLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Synchronoss Adopts Verizon's Next Generation Private Cloud Infrastructure,"BRIDGEWATER N.J.

Verve Therapeutics’ base editing program has been forced into a detour after the FDA placed a hold on its investigational new drug (IND) application.

One month after submitting the IND to the FDA the biotech was notified Friday of the hold with the promise of a detailed letter to follow within 30 days.

A Phase I trial of VERVE-101 for patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) is already underway in New Zealand and the U.K. The first patient was dosed in July.

Verve’s base editor technology is licensed from Beam Therapeutics. Instead of utilizing a double-strand DNA cut like earlier generations of CRISPR base editing swaps out a single DNA letter for another. This technique is believed to carry fewer risks of complications and off-target edits.

“The dosing of the first human with such an investigational base editing medicine represents a significant achievement by our team and for the field of gene editing” said Sekar Kathiresan M.D co-founder and CEO of Verve in July.

Beam Provides Pipeline Updates

However the new base editing approach has already run into regulatory hurdles. In July Beam’s own cancer therapy IND was slapped with a clinical hold. BEAM-201 targets CD7 for relapsed refractory T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

In Beam’s case the FDA requested:

Additional control data from genomic rearrangement assessments

Further analyses of certain off-target editing experiments

additional control data for a cytokine-independent growth assay

an updated investigator brochure that includes information regarding any new nonclinical studies

Beam has submitted its response and is awaiting the all-clear from the agency.

The biotech also has two cell therapies in the pipeline for sickle cell disease. The IND for BEAM-101 has been cleared by the FDA; Beam is prepping for a Phase I/II trial initiation for safety and efficacy. The trial will include an initial “sentinel” cohort of three patients treated one at a time to ensure engraftment followed by up to 45 patients. Enrollment is expected before year-end.

Beam announced it will not submit an IND for the second candidate to optimize its approach.

Next moves for Verve

As Verve waits on the FDA to make its next move its heart-1 study of VERVE-101 in patients with HeFH in New Zealand and the U.K. will carry on. The dose escalation portion of the trial has been completed successfully in all three patients the company reported. With no treatment-related adverse events to report the trial is expected to move on to the second dose level.

Data from this trial was not included in the company’s IND submission.

Cardiovascular disease remains the world’s number one killer. HeFH is the most common monogenic disorder characterized by high LDL-C and premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The condition affects approximately 1.3 million people in the U.S. and 31 million globally.

With a single dose Verve intends its candidate to permanently turn off PCSK9 in the liver a gene that plays a critical role in controlling blood LDL cholesterol levels. Reduction of this protein improves the liver’s ability to clear LDL from the blood.

The company will work closely with the FDA to resolve the hold to begin dosing U.S. patients as quickly as possible according to the press release.

A second program VERVE-201 targets a key regulating gene for cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism for patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). IND-enabling studies are currently underway.

Verve has the funds to carry the programs forward with $550.7 million on hand as of Sept. 30. Massachusetts neighbor Vertex Pharmaceuticals dropped $60 million into Verve’s accounts this summer with up to $340 million more on the line. The four-year partnership is for a gene editing therapy for an undisclosed liver disease.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vYmlvdGVjaC92ZXJ2ZS10aGVyYXBldXRpY3MtY3J1c2hlZC1ieS1jbGluaWNhbC1ob2xk0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Verve Therapeutics Crushed By Clinical Hold,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.thestreet.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /biotech/verve-therapeutics-crushed-by-clinical-hold (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF32B2BC0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vYmlvdGVjaC92ZXJ2ZS10aGVyYXBldXRpY3MtY3J1c2hlZC1ieS1jbGluaWNhbC1ob2xk0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhYmlvdGVjaC5ldS9pbi1kZXB0aC9nZW5lLWVkaXRpbmctdGhlcmFweS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What's on the horizon for gene editing-based therapies?,"Gene editing has come far in the past decade. However the field is still finding its feet regarding challenges such as drug delivery regulation and competition with first-generation gene therapies.

Gene editing is a sizzling hot topic in the biotech industry powered by advances in genetic tools such as CRISPR TALENs and zinc-finger nucleases. Gene editing biotech players are developing ways to harness the technology to correct mutations that lead to genetic diseases.

“The promise of gene editing is so amazing” said Devyn Smith CEO of the gene editing company Arbor Biotechnologies. He added that much of the interest in the technology is its potential to not just treat diseases but to cure them.

The most advanced CRISPR-based cell therapies have already reached late-stage clinical testing. This includes exa-cel developed by CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of the blood disorders sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia. The treatment involves extracting a patient’s stem cells from the blood gene editing them to let them carry more oxygen and reinfusing them.

Despite the promising progress of gene editing technology in gene and cell therapies there is much untapped potential. For example of the thousands of rare diseases in existence only 5 percent are estimated to have an approved treatment.

Smith and a group of industry experts discussed current directions in gene editing in a session at the 2022 Cell & Gene Meeting on the Mesa in October 2022. Moderated by Tim Farries principal consultant and senior director of the consulting firm Biopharma Excellence the group also covered challenges to the technology including delivering the therapy the market space and liaising with regulators.

Gene editing versus traditional gene therapies

Traditional gene therapies have been in development for decades and typically involve the delivery of a therapeutic gene to a patient via a viral vector. In contrast gene editing therapies are designed to tweak the DNA that is already in a patient. This might involve deleting and adding bits of DNA or a flexible mixture of both.

Earlier generations of CRISPR-based therapies are limited to tweaking cells removed from the patient and reinfused referred to as an “ex vivo” model. Newer so-called “in vivo” candidates are in development to be delivered directly into the patient like a gene therapy and could permanently correct mutations in a patient’s DNA.

One limitation of traditional gene therapy is that it is most effective in tissue where cells aren’t dividing and reproducing themselves like nerve cells in the brain. Meanwhile CRISPR-based edits to the genome can be transmitted to new generations of cells so gene editing therapies can be used in tissues with a higher turnover rate such as the liver in young children.

“You are almost dependent on being able to go in and correct the cell at the DNA level in order to get that long term durability” said Albert Seymour president and CEO of Homology Medicines.

Safety and regulations for gene editing

As the gene editing space is still very new there are many unknowns regarding the safety of the technology.

“As we push new technologies into rare disease areas where they haven’t been there isn’t much of a precedent” noted Mark Shearman CSO of the firm Editas Medicine.

In the last year LogicBio faced its own safety issues in a phase 1/2 trial in children with the life-threatening disorder methylmalonic acidemia. The firm recorded two cases of serious side effects known as thrombotic microangiopathy leading the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to put a clinical hold on the trial. The FDA eventually gave LogicBio the go-ahead again in May 2022.

“Unfortunately we faced some safety issues in one of our clinical trials” said Fred Chereau president and CEO of LogicBio. He added that it is reassuring when companies communicate with each other at events and share how they can overcome these issues.

Another key point was that the field is so early-stage that gene editing companies must stay in close contact with the FDA to navigate the shifting regulatory scene and learn from each other.

The onus will also be on the regulatory agencies to determine what the safety threshold will be for gene editing therapies. For example demanding data on very rare adverse events like off-target edits might sometimes be counter-productive.

“If it’s a one-in-a-billion event but yet you’re having a hundred double strand breaks in every cell in your body every single day at some point it is in the realm of silliness” said Smith.

Investor and payer attitudes to gene-edited therapies

Gene editing technology is seen as a new shiny object in the greater landscape of gene and cell therapy investments. This has led to some impressive funding rounds backing gene editing players with one example being Arbor Biotechnologies’ $215 million Series B round in November 2021.

Additionally in spite of the gloomy outlook in public biotech markets gene editing players have been spared the worst of the uncertainty.

“The valuations have held up remarkably well considering what’s happened in the market” said Smith. “Investors get it but I think it’s incumbent on all of us in this space to continue to execute and hopefully generate that positive clinical data so that momentum continues.”

However there are headwinds for investors in the gene editing space to come. The emerging field needs to answer many questions regarding safety monitoring the technology and manufacturing.

In addition the way that gene editing therapies will be paid for is currently unclear. Companies developing traditional gene therapies such as Orchard Therapeutics and bluebird bio are currently blazing a trail. Their ongoing negotiations with payers in multiple nations demonstrate how difficult it is to set a fair price for their potentially life-saving products.

Smith sees this dilemma as one ripe for new ideas.

“You’re starting to see hints of this where someone’s going to figure out how to innovate in this space on the payer side and be wildly successful” said Smith adding that future pioneers could “completely upend the way we are doing things.”

From rare diseases to bigger indications

One reason that gene editing companies treat rare diseases is that their target indications in this camp are often caused by a single mutation that can be corrected easily. However once the technology advances the companies can begin to expand to treat diseases with more patients but that have more complicated genetic underpinnings.

“There are companies within the gene editing space that are swinging for the fences and they’re going after common cardiovascular disorders for example” said Shearman.

However more common diseases such as cancer will take a lot more study as the genetic factors driving the disease are much less clear.

“We don’t yet have a broad handle on the underlying genetics” noted Smith. “Alzheimer’s disease is probably not one disease; it’s probably 55 small diseases each having different genetic drivers.”

Additionally the question of reimbursement will need to be addressed when gene editing is applied to common indications affecting a million patients or more. As the first antibody treatments get approved for slowing down Alzheimer’s disease this will be watched closely by the gene editing community as a case study on how to decide the pricing strategy in this very common indication.

In vivo: how to deliver the therapy into the body

As more and more gene editing companies develop in vivo approaches the question of how to deliver the gene editing machinery to where it needs to go in the patient’s body opens up. Additionally designing the gene editing machinery to work in human cells makes it tough to test them in animal models first.

“There are no preclinical models that you can use to predict what you might see clinically” said Seymour. “That’s a big challenge.”

Many companies are using viral vectors to get the gene editing tool into the patient’s body. However great control is required to make sure that the editing only happens in the tissue of interest. For example Editas is using cell type-specific “promoter” regions in its therapy to make sure the genetic material is only expressed in the correct cells.

Other challenges for delivering in vivo gene editing therapies will be making sure that the immune system doesn’t attack the therapy and blunt its effects. Another will be crossing the blood-brain barrier to treat conditions in the central nervous system.

According to Chereau there has been massive progress in the development of gene therapy vectors such as viral vectors and the emergence of RNA therapies that can be delivered in lipid nanoparticles. However it will still take time to find ways for these therapies to cross from the blood into the brain.

Gene editing will find its niche

There is a tradeoff developing for gene editing players as traditional gene therapies gain momentum. If the early generations of gene therapy could theoretically cure rare diseases would that leave less room for the gene editing players to shine?

The trick will be for gene editing companies to carefully select indications that are less covered by the competition or to find their edge over traditional gene therapy. For example traditional gene therapy might suit adult patients with hemophilia whereas gene editing might be better for younger patients with the same disease.

“Are we to the point where we can cure every disease out there? No” stated Smith. “It’s a journey but you’re seeing a lot of great progress.”",,,
VTRS,Viatris,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vbWVkY2l0eW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvdmlhdHJpcy1zZWVzLXZpc2lvbi1kcnVncy1hcy1rZXktdG8tZ3Jvd3RoLWFuZC1jb21taXRzLTc1MG0tdG8tdHdvLW1hLWRlYWxzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Viatris Sees Vision Drugs as Key to Growth and Commits $750M to Two M&A Deals,"Viatris which is in the midst of a strategy shift intended to return the company to revenue growth is acquiring two companies that together bring one commercialized product and five programs ready for pivotal testing or already in Phase 3 development.

The new assets coming to Viatris are in ophthalmology one of the new areas of focus for the company. In total Viatris said it expects to spend between $700 million and $750 million to acquire publicly traded Oyster Point Pharma and privately held Famy Life Sciences.

The acquisitions announced Monday come less than two years after the close of the merger that formed Viatris bringing together the generic drugs giant Mylan with Upjohn the generic medications and off-patent drugs unit of Pfizer. In its new incarnation Viatris aimed to offer a portfolio of drugs projected to top $3 billion in global revenue. The Canonsburg Pennsylvania-based company would soon change course.

In February Viatris announced it had agreed to sell its biosimilars business to Biocon Biologics for $3.3 billion. That deal resulted from a strategic review conducted to streamline the business and better position it for growth. “Non-core” assets like biosimilars would be sold. The remaining Viatris business would focus on three therapeutic areas: ophthalmology gastrointestinal and dermatology. At the time that deal was announced Viatris also disclosed it had acquired rights to Pimecrolimus an eye ointment to treat blepharitis a type of eye irritation. The company’s latest deals further expand its eye drug ambitions.

Oyster Point’s main asset is Tyrvaya a dry eye disease drug approved last year that the biotech company developed in a nasal spray formulation. The drug works by binding to certain receptors activating them to stimulate cells and glands involved in producing the tear film covering the eye. For the first half of this year the Princeton New Jersey-based company reported the drug accounted for $7.3 million in revenue. Oyster Point’s pipeline includes two preclinical gene therapies in development for certain eye surface diseases.

According to the financial terms of deal Viatris will pay $11 cash for each share of Oyster Point. That price is a 31.7% premium to the stock’s closing price last Friday. The agreement also includes a contingent value right an additional $2 per share payment that’s tied to Oyster Point achieving certain goals.

Sponsored Post A Personalized Approach to Medication Nonadherence At the Abarca Forward conference earlier this year George Van Antwerp managing director at Deloitte discussed how social determinants of health and a personalized member experience can improve medication adherence and health outcomes.

Viatris is paying about $300 million to acquire Famy Life Sciences according to the Economic Times a business newspaper in India where Famy is based. The Times reported that the Taparia family which owned the company will keep the non-ophthalmic business. There’s history behind the transaction. In 2015 Mylan paid $750 million up front to acquire Famy Care a women’s healthcare company started by the Taparias. Family members started Famy Life Sciences in 2017.

According to a Viatris investor presentation Famy’s five clinical-stage ophthalmic programs include Phase 3-ready assets for dry eye disease blepharitis and presbyopia. A drug candidate for dim light or night vision disturbances is already in Phase 3 testing; a Phase 3 test in rehydration of mydriasis is complete. The products and product candidates coming to the company in the acquisitions are projected to generate more than $1 billion in revenue by 2028 Viatris said in the presentation.

“These acquisitions bring us an innovative growth asset Tyrvaya and five additional Phase 3 or Phase 3-ready programs that give us a significant head-start in creating a leading ophthalmology franchise” Viatris CEO Michael Goettler said in a prepared statement.

The Oyster Point acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023. When it does Oyster Point CEO Jeff Nau will lead the new Viatris ophthalmology business which will operate as a separate division within the larger company.

Monday the company simuntaneously unveiled the purchase of Oyster Point Pharma at $11 per share—plus $2 per share in contingent value rights—and Famy Life Sciences for an undisclosed sum. Together the deals are worth between $700 million and $750 million.

Viatris expects the buyout targets to add $1 billion to its sales by 2028 the company said. The drugmaker formed in late 2020 through the merger of Mylan and Pfizer's Upjohn unit will fund the purchases with cash on hand.

The moves are part of Viatris' effort to create a ""leading"" ophthalmology unit. The company aims to combine its R&D capabilities and “global commercial footprint"" to build a presence in the field and it will be starting out with a commercial asset thanks to the Oyster Point buy.

Last October Oyster Point's Tyrvaya won FDA approval to treat dry eye disease with a novel approach. The drug is administered through the nose as opposed to traditional eye drops activating a nerve in the nose that triggers the production of tears in the eyeball.

The moves mark somewhat of a pivot for the company since its launch in late 2020. Viatris initially launched with a presence in biosimilars but opted to sell that franchise to partner Biocon earlier this year for $3.3 billion.

The company aims to close the Oyster Point acquisition by the first quarter of 2023. As for this past quarter Viatris pulled down $4.1 billion in sales a 10% decline from the same period last year as currency fluctuations took a toll on the company's financial performance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpb3NwYWNlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3ZpYXRyaXMtc2Vlcy1wcm9taXNlLWluLW95c3Rlci1wb2ludC1zLWV5ZS1wb3J0Zm9saW8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Viatris Acquires Oyster Point Gains Access to Ophthalmic Pipeline,"Eye specialist Oyster Point Pharma announced is being acquired by Viatris Inc. after Oyster’s board of directors unanimously signed off on the deal Oyster Point announced Monday.

Under the acquisition offer Viatris will purchase all outstanding Oyster Point shares at $11.00 per share to be paid in cash at the deal’s closing. The agreement also includes a contingent value right for additional cash payments of up to $2.00 per share upon achieving specific performance targets in 2022.

In particular Oyster Point’s shareholders will get $1.00 more per share if the New Jersey biotech generates at least $21.6 million net revenue of Tyrvaya (varenicline solution). This add-on increases to $2.00 per share if net revenues reach $24.0 million.

The companies expect to close the transaction early next year.

In a statement Jeffrey Nau Ph.D. MMS president and chief executive officer of Oyster Point said the acquisition agreement will bring together his company’s portfolio and industry expertise with Viatris’ global scale and capabilities to “meaningfully shape the future of eye care to the benefit of patients.”

After the deal has been closed Viatris will then move to acquire all remaining shares of Oyster Point that were not tendered into the buyout offer. This second-step merger will have the same per-share price of $11.00 along with the $2.00 CVR.

A Promising Portfolio

The buyout will grant Viatris access to Oyster Point’s Tyrvaya a therapeutic nasal spray approved by the FDA in October 2021. Tyrvaya is the first and only FDA-approved nasal spray for dry eye in the U.S.

Tyrvaya is a highly selective cholinergic agonist that mimics the action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine to activate the parasympathetic nervous system promoting the production of the basal tear film and ultimately easing dry eye symptoms. Varenicline the drug’s active component can engage the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor on the trigeminal nerve which is accessible through the nose.

In June before the drug’s launch Oyster Point cut off some 50 employees to “prioritize launch expenses for Tyrvaya and its field-based sales resources” Nau said. The job cuts were concentrated in general and administrative roles and the company continued to allocate some 150 to 200 field-based sales personnel to drive the product launch.

Nau added that the company believes this will reduce the total operating expenses and continue to drive the Tyrvaya launch forward.

Aside from the dry eye nasal spray Oyster Point will also hand over a healthy pipeline of ophthalmic therapies. This includes OC-01 another nasal spray formulation of a varenicline solution currently under Phase II assessments for stage I neurotrophic keratopathy. Results are expected later this year.

The pipeline also involves two gene therapies: OC-101 AAV-NGF for stage 2 and 3 neurotrophic keratopathy and OC-103 AAV-DAO for vernal or atopic keratoconjunctivitis. Both are intravitreally injected and are scheduled for pre-investigational new drug meetings within the year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MtbWVkaWNhbC5uZXQvZHJ1Z3MvRW50ZWNhdmlyLVZpYXRyaXMuYXNweNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Entecavir Viatris (Entecavir) Drug / Medicine Information,"NOTICE: This Consumer Medicine Information (CMI) is intended for persons living in Australia.

PITTSBURGH Nov. 7 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Viatris Inc. (NASDAQ: VTRS) a global healthcare company today announced that it intends to create an ophthalmology franchise by acquiring Oyster Point Pharma and Famy Life Sciences and that it will provide a strategic update on its February 2022 Investor Event in a conference call and live webcast today at 8:30 a.m. ET.

Under the terms of a definitive agreement Viatris has agreed to acquire Oyster Point for $11 per share in cash upfront through a tender offer. In addition each Oyster Point stockholder will receive one non-tradeable contingent value right representing up to an additional $2 per share contingent upon Oyster Point's achieving certain metrics based on full year 2022 performance.

Viatris is targeting to close the acquisition of Oyster Point in Q1 2023 subject to customary closing conditions including receipt of regulatory approval and tender acceptance of more than 50% of Oyster Point shares.

Concurrently the Company also expects to acquire Famy Life Sciences which has a complementary ophthalmology portfolio.

The Company anticipates these acquisitions have the potential to add at least $1 billion in sales by 2028. As a result of the expected strong top-line growth the Company anticipates it will also add at least $500 million in adjusted EBITDA by 2028.

Together the two acquisitions have an aggregate purchase price of approximately $700-$750 million which Viatris expects to fund with cash on hand.

Ophthalmology is one of the key therapeutic areas of focus that the Company identified in February. With the combination of Viatris' global commercial footprint R&D and regulatory capabilities and supply chain along with Oyster Point's deep knowledge of the ophthalmology space from a clinical medical regulatory and commercial perspective—including a commercial asset Tyrvaya® for the treatment of dry eye disease— and Famy Life Sciences' Phase III-ready pipeline the Company believes it has the foundation to create a leading global ophthalmology franchise accelerating efforts to address the unmet needs of patients with ophthalmic disease and the eye care professionals who treat them. The ophthalmology franchise will function as a separate division within the company and will be led by current Oyster Point CEO Jeff Nau Ph.D. upon the closing of the transaction.

Executive Comments

For more detailed information on the risks and uncertainties associated with Viatris see the risks described in Part I Item 1A in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31 2021 as amended and our other filings with the SEC. You can access Viatris' filings with the SEC through the SEC website at www.sec.gov or through our website and Viatris strongly encourages you to do so. Viatris routinely posts information that may be important to investors on our website at investor.viatris.com and we use this website address as a means of disclosing material information to the public in a broad non-exclusionary manner for purposes of the SEC's Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg FD). The contents of our website are not incorporated into this release or our other filings with the SEC. Viatris undertakes no obligation to update any statements herein for revisions or changes after the date of this release other than as required by law.

In particular certain statements in this release relate to the Phase I and II Outlooks including but not limited to providing financial targets for Phase 2 (2024 to 2028) including top-line total revenues CAGR of ~3% adjusted EBITDA CAGR of ~4-5% and adjusted EPS CAGR of ~mid-teens expecting total pre-tax proceeds expected from the Biocon Biologics Transaction and certain non-core asset divestitures to be up to approximately $9 billion anticipating combined assets from the two transactions announced today to have the potential to add at least $1 billion in net sales and at least $500 million in adjusted EBITDA by 2028 and our gross leverage ratio target. Viatris believes that the assumptions used as a basis for the Phase I and II Outlooks are reasonable based on the information available to management at this time. However this information is not fact and you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such information. While certain of these statements might use language that imply a level of certainty about the likelihood that Viatris will attain the Phase I and II Outlooks it is possible that Viatris will not attain them in the timeframe noted or at all. The Phase I and Phase II Outlooks reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the Phase I and II Outlooks not to be achieved or that may change the underlying variables and assumptions on which the Phase I and II Outlooks were based and cause the Phase I and II Outlooks to differ materially include but are not limited to risks and uncertainties relating to our planned acquisitions and divestitures including whether such transactions are completed on the expected timelines or at all failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions or divestitures failure to receive the anticipated cash proceeds of any divestitures inability to manage base business erosion failure to bring new products to market on the expected timeframes or at all failure to execute stock repurchases consistent with current expectations stock price volatility higher than anticipated SG&A gross margins and R&D spend industry performance interest rate volatility foreign exchange rates tax rates the regulatory environment and general business and economic conditions as well as those set forth in the second paragraph of this ""Forward Looking Statements"" slide. In addition although certain of the outlooks are presented with numerical specificity they are still forward-looking statements that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Further the Phase I and II Outlooks cover multiple years and such information by its nature becomes less reliable with each successive year. Accordingly there can be no assurance that any aspect of the Phase I and II Outlooks will be realized or that actual results will not differ materially. Therefore you should construe these statements regarding the Phase I and II Outlooks only as goals targets and objectives rather than promises of future performance or absolute statements.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This press release includes the presentation and discussion of certain financial information that differs from what is reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""U.S. GAAP""). These non-GAAP financial measures including but not limited to adjusted EBITDA free cash flow adjusted EPS and gross leverage ratio target are presented in order to supplement investors' and other readers' understanding and assessment of the financial performance of Viatris. Free cash flow refers to U.S. GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Adjusted diluted earnings per share (""adjusted EPS"") refers to adjusted net earnings divided by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the relevant period. For the third quarter of 2022 Viatris calculated adjusted net earnings as U.S. GAAP net earnings (loss) adjusted for purchase accounting related amortization litigation settlements and other contingencies net interest expense acquisition related cost restructuring related costs share-based compensation expense other special items included in cost of sales SG&A expense and other (income) expense net and the tax effect of the above items and other income tax related items. For the third quarter of 2022 Viatris calculated adjusted EBITDA as U.S. GAAP net earnings (loss) adjusted for income tax provision (benefit) interest expense and depreciation and amortization (to get to EBITDA) and further adjusted for share-based compensation expense litigation settlements and other contingencies net and restructuring acquisition related and other special items. Viatris has provided reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. Investors and other readers are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures set forth in this release on our website at https://investor.viatris.com/financial-information/non-gaap-reconciliations and investors and other readers should consider non-GAAP measures only as supplements to not as substitutes for or as superior measures to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Phase II Outlook

The Company is not providing forward-looking information for U.S. GAAP net earnings (loss) U.S. GAAP earnings per share (""U.S. GAAP EPS"") and U.S. GAAP net cash provided by operating activities or a quantitative reconciliation of its Phase II adjusted EBITDA adjusted EPS and free cash flow outlooks or expectations to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures U.S. GAAP net earnings (loss) U.S. GAAP EPS and U.S. GAAP net cash provided by operating activities respectively because it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of certain significant items including integration and acquisition-related expenses restructuring expenses asset impairments litigation settlements and other contingencies such as changes to contingent consideration and certain other gains or losses as well as related income tax accounting because certain of these items have not occurred are out of the Company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain depend on various factors and could have a material impact on U.S. GAAP reported results for the relevant periods.

Gross Leverage Target

The stated forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure of long-term gross leverage target of 3.0x with a range of 2.8x – 3.2x is based on the ratio of (i) targeted notional gross debt and (ii) targeted Adjusted EBITDA. However the Company has not quantified future amounts to develop this target but has stated its goal to manage notional gross debt and adjusted earnings and adjusted EBITDA over time in order to generally maintain or reach the target. This target does not reflect Company guidance.

B&B Spoilers Highlights

Liam (Scott Clifton) walked away and disappeared during the biggest night of Hope Logan Spencer’s (Annika Noelle) career. He let his feelings of jealousy and bad blood towards Thomas Forrester (Matthew Atkinson) get the best of him and boy does he regret it. Missing her big moment was a bad move and he wants to make it right.

Liam offers up a sincere apology and acknowledges he did a very wrong thing. His duty to Hope and love for her should have come before his disdain for her ex. He should have put the love of his life first.

Bold and Beautiful: Regrets All-Around

Liam’s actions hurt Hope deeply. The sting of him not showing up for her cut her heart in two. So much so she was pushed straight to Thomas Forrester (Matthew Atkinson) and did something she regrets. Very very much regrets it.

READ THIS: Find out what happened today on Bold and the Beautiful.

Will these cracks break the fragile foundation of their already rocky marriage? Things have not been easy since Hope decided to continue letting Thomas be part of their lives after all his misdeeds and it’s not going to get much better going forward. Perhaps a good old fashion dose of honesty is needed.

B&B Spoilers: Wishful Thinking?

As for Thomas he does not regret a single second he stole with Hope. He dissects what went down and wonders what can come next. Does he have a chance at a future with her? Did he get under her skin? Is she thinking about him too?

A life with Hope is what Thomas wants most in this world. He would love nothing more than to be her husband and raise their son and her daughter together. Oh what a dream come true that would be!

Fundraising for disaster relief efforts and charities working to support displaced citizens in active warzones. Applying technology solutions to help sports organisations and venue operators reduce their carbon emissions and encourage event-goers to make more sustainable choices.

Those are just some of the ways the brands recognised in this year’s Laureus Sport For Good Index are using their respective platform and investments in sport to bring about positive social and environmental change.

Released this week the second edition of the Index features 29 brands from multiple industry sectors including sports goods and apparel consumer products technology energy financial services and transport. Between them these brands are making a tangible difference through innovation creativity and a commitment towards building a more prosperous and equitable society.

Through their partnerships in sport each of the companies is implementing social and environmental sustainability initiatives that are material to their business and intended to benefit both people and the planet. With a clear focus across the triple bottom line their approaches and investments differ in many ways but what unites them is a shared purpose to drive meaningful progress through sport for good campaigns.

Here SportsPro breaks down this year’s Laureus Sport For Good Index by sector to identify how the class of 2022 are leading their industries and using sport as a vehicle to achieve long-term purpose-led objectives.

Sports goods and apparel

The Laureus Sport For Good Index recognises brands doing good work from within sport as well as those investing from outside the industry. As such sports goods and apparel brands are well represented once again this year with 12 companies – 41 per cent of the total – hailing from this all-important endemic sector.

It is no secret that sportswear manufacturers and retailers have a pivotal role to play in setting the tone and creating value for the sports industry. For legions of fans they are the most visible touchpoints through which sport is experienced and fandom is expressed in their everyday lives. What’s more leagues and clubs across all sports rely on them for financing and the provision of technical gear not to mention their sprawling distribution networks and unmatched marketing clout.

Such is their scale and influence that tip-of-the-tongue global brands like Nike and Adidas wield considerable responsibility to lead by example. By implementing more sustainable business practices developing more eco-friendly products putting out responsible messaging and inspiring future generations with viral marketing campaigns they have the power to be forces for good in industries where manufacturing and supply chains span the entire globe but remain opaque and widely scrutinised.

There is no single common thread that unites the work of each of the sports apparel brands that feature in the Index. Priorities and ambitions differ of course but what is clear is that they are all purpose-driven companies – some are certified B Corps – that are using their sport for good activities to achieve broader ESG-related business objectives.

From Patagonia the poster child for corporate activism to Hummel recently named Denmark’s most sustainable clothing brand for the third year running these companies have plenty to teach others about what it means to run a socially conscious business.

Nike’s Move to Zero initiative is intended to reduce the company’s carbon emissions and waste

Consumer products

In their messaging and advertising in the way they choose to do business and manufacture products in their ability to embed themselves into the hearts and minds of people young and old consumer-facing brands hold unique influence over consumer behaviour and everyday purchasing decisions.

In sport brands are using that influence in myriad ways. Indeed the five consumer products companies on this year’s Index – Clif Bar EA Sports Lego Rexona and SunGod – are working to highlight and tackle a broad range of issues from gender equality and food security to ocean conservation and youth education.

Clif Bar in particular has long been a leader in corporate social responsibility (CSR) having made sustainability a central focus of its brand ethos for three decades. But what sets these businesses apart is the manner in which they measure and report their impact.

As well as putting forth clear mission statements and eye-catching campaigns that seek to engage mass market consumers all of them were highly commended by the Index judging panel for the depth and breadth of the data they capture and the specific outcomes they publicise around their respective projects.

WNBA partner Google has taken steps to boost the visibility and discoverability of women’s basketball content

Technology

As critical service providers technology companies provide the technological backbone upon which much of sport’s physical and digital architecture is built. Yet many are now using their partnerships in sport for a higher purpose one that goes beyond the mere provision of software and hardware.

Through the innovative deployment of technology solutions these companies are applying their expertise and services for all manner of good causes not least female empowerment. In collaboration with various sports partners and non-profits for example Microsoft is operating STEM-based educational programmes for young girls and using its Teams co-working platform to facilitate connections between elite athletes and a global community of female fans.

Like Microsoft Google has also been particularly active to women’s sport. As a WNBA changemaker and official partner of the International Basketball Federation (Fiba) the tech giant is taking steps to boost the visibility and discoverability of women’s basketball content part of its broader commitment to achieving more balanced gender representation in the media.

Elsewhere SAP is helping organisations of all kinds – from elite entities like the National Hockey League (NHL) and Mercedes-EQ Formula E team to grassroots sports clubs – to monitor and reduce their ecological footprint through cloud-based platforms and tools. Meanwhile lesser-known firms like Rubicon Xylem and Xero are doing equally impactful work in this space behind the scenes helping to enhance awareness and education around issues that directly affect both their businesses and society at large.

FC Bayern main partner Allianz is aiming to improve gender diversity through its ‘All Are United’ campaign

Financial services

Another sector drawn to women’s sport is financial services. The two finance companies that feature on this year’s Index Allianz and Visa are both heavily invested in female properties and athletes and both are using their investments to support broader ESG objectives relating to diversity equity and inclusion.

FC Bayern main partner Allianz is aiming to improve gender diversity through campaigns like its ‘All Are United’ initiative and Allianz Sports Fund while Visa a Uefa Women’s Football partner since 2018 is running various dedicated women’s soccer projects and has launched The Second Half a programme which supports female soccer players in Europe as they consider their post-playing careers.

While neither feature in the Index this year two other financial firms recognised in 2021 Barclays and Santander have taken similar approaches with targeted investments in women’s soccer within their respective domestic markets of the UK and Spain. Visa rival Mastercard another 2021 honouree is also a prominent supporter of the National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) in the US.

No doubt there are numerous reasons for why the finance sector is putting its money behind women’s sport – accelerating growth and the potential for commercial returns chief among them. The impact their money is having at the elite end is already apparent but their work at the community and grassroots level through sport for good projects if sustained in the coming years is sure to have a far-reaching influence over time.

Spanish energy firm Iberdrola is working to reduce the environmental impact of sports facilities such as Madrid’s City of Sustainable Football

Energy and transport

Two further sectors represented in this year’s Index energy and transport are much like technology in that they primarily perform a service provider role within sport. By their nature both industries are hardly the most ecologically sustainable when compared to many other sectors yet some companies are clearly more committed than others to reducing the environmental impact of the sports industry.

Logistics firm Kuehne+Nagel through its work with the likes of SailGP and the Rugby League World Cup is driving progress towards net zero supply chains while Nissan the only carmaker in the Index is actively showcasing the potential benefits of electric vehicles through its participation in Formula E.

Elsewhere energy firms Ecotricity and Iberdrola were both recognised for their work helping sports organisations to go green and promote sustainable mobility. UK-based Ecotricity partners with and powers more than 200 charities and teams such as Forest Green Rovers dubbed the world’s greenest soccer club with renewable energy while Spanish firm Iberdrola is working to reduce the environmental impact of elite sports facilities including the first City of Sustainable Football in Madrid.

Together such initiatives have the power to dramatically accelerate the green sports movement and inspire major carbon emitters to see the benefits in adopting more sustainable practices.

Reddit has emerged as an important platform for investors in the last couple of years. Leading subreddits like r/WallStreetBets r/stocks and r/investing boast 12.9 million 4.8 million and 2.1 million members respectively as of Q3 2022. Reddit has introduced thousands to the investing world and the subreddits on the social news aggregation platform are actively used to discuss investment ideas that can provide a high return on investment (ROI). Reddit played an integral role in some of the most famous short squeezes of 2021. Investors looking to manipulate the market posted information on the social media platform pushing the general public to acquire shares in the expectation of capital gains. This onslaught was driven by various objectives including making profits and the need to pressure hedge funds into covering their short bets. Retail investors started purchasing “meme-stocks” such as GameStop and AMC Entertainment due to the information shared on Reddit. As a result the stock prices skyrocketed with GameStop increasing by more than 1000% within only two weeks. Stocks such as Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) Salesforce Inc. (NYSE:CRM) and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) are among the best Reddit stocks gaining investor attention on the social media platform recently.

Polen Capital shared its outlook on SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:

“SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is Europe’s largest software company and the global leader in enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. ERP is a software category that is particularly critical to business functions and therefore has high retention rates even in times of economic stress. For the past several years SAP has been going through several transitions including moving to cloud-based SaaS (Software as a service) solutions and an initiative to better integrate its various software solutions. In recent quarters we have seen increasing evidence that both transitions are being successfully executed and the result should be a faster-growing more consistent higher margin and more advantaged business. As investment costs from these transition programs wane and as the benefits of higher growth continue we expect that earnings will grow at a double-digit rate from next year (2023) onwards. In light of this we believe the valuation is very attractive for longterm investors.”

“Within our Disruptive Growth group some companies depreciated in value. New position FIGS Inc. (NYSE:FIGS) declined about 15%. The relatively new direct-to-consumer producer of health care apparel has declined along with the broader group of young high-growth publicly traded companies. Investors have continued to shun newer business models that they perceive to be riskier. The company has declined over 80% from its highs achieved in late 2021. The recent volatility created an opportunity for us to initiate and build a position in a company that we believe can continue to grow revenue above 20% annually while also expanding margins. Its superior product is competing against brands that lack investment capabilities to improve their offerings. We believe Figs could command a meaningful share of the $79 billion global health care apparel market and eventually develop products for other professions.”

GWW ranks 8th on our list of the best Reddit stocks to invest in. W.W. Grainger Inc. (NYSE:GWW) is a Lake Forest Illinois-based industrial supply company.

Reddit users find the company’s online channel user-friendly and efficient. W.W. Grainger Inc. (NYSE:GWW) differentiates itself from Home Depot and other similar retailers by catering to the needs of businesses that use purchase orders instead of credit card receipts. On October 17 Stephen Volkmann at Jefferies resumed coverage on W.W. Grainger Inc. (NYSE:GWW) stock with a target price of $600 and a Buy rating. The analyst thinks that W.W. Grainger Inc.’s (NYSE:GWW) growth strategy is coming to fruition and the valuation also appears to be reasonable. Volkmann believes that the company’s scale expansion and digital strategy will help capture greater market share and aid in maintaining a healthy top line in an uncertain macroeconomic environment.

Third Avenue Management shared its stance on W.W. Grainger Inc. (NYSE:GWW) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:

“Held in the Fund since 2019 Grainger plc (“Grainger”) is a UK-based real estate operating company that is the leading owner manager and developer of multi-family properties in the supply-constrained markets of the UK (where the multi-family business is more commonly referred to as the private-rental sector or “PRS”). At the end of the 2021 calendar year the company owned a portfolio of 7100 PRS units that were 95.0% leased with two-thirds of the value in the greater London area and the remaining one-third in the other UK regions. In addition to its stabilized portfolio of “market-rate” PRS properties Grainger also owns a portfolio of approximately 2500 “rent-controlled” units dating back to its roots as a more diversified residential company (Grainger was founded in 1912). Due to the regulated nature of these properties only about 8-10% of the units can be disposed of each year. However the proceeds from these sales as well as the earnings the company retains as an operating company as opposed to a REIT are being utilized to build out its strategic development pipeline with planning for almost 8400 additional PRS units- including 3000 very well-located units through its joint venture with the Transport for London (TFL). Despite being well-capitalized with a loan-to-value ratio of approximately 30% alongside prospects to self-finance its development pipeline that is expected to increase its recurring cash flows by more than 90% through 2025 Grainger’s common stock continues to trade at a discount to its stated NAV (which is provided annually based upon third-party appraisals under International Financial Reporting Standards). This inefficiency may very well relate to Grainger’s status as an operating company not a REIT which leaves the company out of certain Real Estate indices and mandates. It is not inconceivable though that as the company further builds out its stabilized PRS portfolio it may ultimately elect REIT tax status serving to boost its annual dividend and widening its potential investor base. Should such a modification not materialize and the price- to-value gap remain there would also likely be a great deal of strategic interest in the platform given Grainger’s scale in this emerging asset class within the UK.”

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32

DPZ ranks 9th on our list of the best Reddit stocks to buy now. Domino’s Pizza Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) is an Ann Arbor Michigan-based globally renowned pizza restaurant chain. The company operates in 90 countries and has more than 19000 restaurants.

They were headquartered in San Francisco close to the storied Silicon Valley and home to some of the world’s top tech talent — and investors. Everything oozed that contagious if slightly corny ""move fast and break things"" startup mentality.

Despite all that Bounce packed its bags and moved to Europe — the motivation being to tap into markets like Italy France and the UK. The company made the decision even before the pandemic sparked a San Fran exodus beating some of their peers on the way out.

Now the majority of Bounce’s 45 employees have relocated to Lisbon some of whom had never visited the city before and didn't speak Portuguese.

So why did a home-grown US startup abandon the Valley for a city of half a million people and no Googles or Facebooks to its name?

An ‘up and coming’ startup scene

The choice was as much to do with the reality of California as it was the promise of European markets.

“There were a couple of issues with San Francisco — hiring there was a bit tough because talent often doesn't stay at one company very long. And as an early-stage startup you can’t compete (for talent) with big tech companies” says Cody Candee Bounce’s founder and CEO.

Plus he says “some of the bigger companies have kind of skewed the work ethic there"" with some employees feeling entitled to have free lunches and massages without having to work too hard.

Candee and a few of his team members ended up setting up shop in Lisbon in September 2020 a month or two before Europe and the US plunged back into lockdown. Lisbon known for hosting the popular tech conference Web Summit and spawning unicorns such as HR tech platform Remote and financial crime detection platform Feedzai “really felt like the most up and coming (startup) city in Europe” says Candee.

Bounce's rooftop workspace

“It’s an important market for Bounce as there’s loads of travel and tourism here” he adds. “We thought we could ride the wave and become a standout company here much more than we could in a place like San Francisco or London.”

It didn’t take a lot of convincing the team either — the weather is lovely year round the vibe in Lisbon is relaxed when you want it to be (at some companies two-hour lunches are a big deal) and there are direct flights from Lisbon to San Francisco Chicago and New York.

Tapping into the “top 5% of talent” is also easier in Lisbon than it is in San Francisco — or even larger European hubs like London Berlin or Paris where there is greater competition from major companies adds Candee.

His plan is to hire almost exclusively in Lisbon where he says there is a lot of great engineering and design talent at an affordable price and have the majority if not all of the team based there. But he realises this approach may become limiting at a later stage in the company’s journey.

When it comes to recruiting senior leaders — Bounce is currently hiring for a product manager for instance — experienced talent that have worked for a Series A or Series B company and have managed a sizeable team can be hard to find in Lisbon. In San Francisco on the other hand this type of talent is aplenty.

But there are other benefits to being part of a smaller tight-knit ecosystem: it’s easy to meet a couple of “super connectors” as Candee calls them. “Pretty soon you can feel like you're connected to everyone” he says.

Given that Lisbon’s workforce is as much involved in tech as in other careers such as art design and hospitality — Bounce’s office in the São Bento neighbourhood is surrounded by quaint vintage shops galleries and cafes — it’s also easy to get out of the startup bubble and meet with creative people who have a different mentality of “where work should fit into your life” Candee says.

But while it's nice that some people in Lisbon — especially digital nomads who came to the city for the lifestyle — like to take a long relaxing weekend clocking out early on a Friday and then roll into the office on Monday morning Candee likes that there is still hustle culture in Lisbon's startup scene: ""if folks want a sort of grind they can do that at Bounce.""

The challenges

The move was not without its challenges.

While the Portuguese government has implemented measures to attract foreign companies such as the Startup Visa programme — which offers successful applicants a two year residency permit — and a reduction on tax rates for overseas residents and investors setting up a company in Portugal is still tricky.

For one thing getting hold of visas for employees who want to relocate from outside the European Union is still a struggle.

The Startup Visa for instance which is designed to fast track immigration for foreign startups “didn’t work at all” according to Candee.

They promised a 40-day turnaround time. It's been over two years and we still haven't heard back

“They promised a 40-day turnaround time. It's been over two years and we still haven't heard back” he says.

Then there was business incorporation. While it is possible to open an entity in a day or two Candee says it took weeks of “painful back and forth” to finalise the process and even to open a bank account. (Anecdotally problems with opening bank accounts as a foreign company persist in startup hubs like Berlin too.)

“There’s definitely a lot more work for the Portuguese government to do to clear the path so folks can get started more easily. There are a lot of initiatives going so I have hope” he says.

There may be more challenges for Portugal ahead as it looks to become a startup nation — beyond just cutting red tape. An increasing number of entrepreneurs moving to Lisbon from elsewhere may however not be welcome news to local residents who worry that the city is already becoming unliveable with a crowded housing market rising prices and an overflow of tourists.

No to hiring and firing

There are some aspects to Portuguese employment law that Candee found quite surprising after coming from the US.

For example it’s harder to fire people in Portugal than it is in the US and there are greater protections for employees when it comes to dismissal.

US companies have been known to be brutal when it comes to axing employees. As the country generally speaking does not enforce a specific notice period companies have been known to give workers just days if not hours to pack up and leave.

Late night team bonding at Bounce

In Lisbon the labour market is much less fluid and you need a pretty good reason to fire anyone. This makes it even more critical for Bounce to hire brilliant people from the get go.

Candee says that fact might have scared him away if it weren’t for the great talent in Lisbon.

“I definitely am more cautious about who we bring on here than I am about who we would bring on in a place like the US that has you know looser rules.”

When it comes to work culture Bounce is relaxed when it comes to the way employees choose to work and it doesn’t enforce office days.

Not all staff are based in Lisbon — there are a few employees in the US and elsewhere in Europe who hope to move to Lisbon soon and the company’s support team is based in the Philippines.

A boat ride on the River Tagus

But it likes to get the whole team together on a quarterly basis for activities. So far the team has done a boat ride along the river and paintballing in a forest outside of Lisbon on company offsites.

“There’s also so many amazing dinner spots where you can have a Michelin-star meal for €40 per person” says Candee.

Bounce is doing the opposite of what many companies are doing right now: instead of building a global remote workforce to handpick the best talent from everywhere it wants to build a team and a culture in the heart of Lisbon.

Whether this will work as the company grows is yet to be seen but for Candee that’s a problem for another day.

These findings come from the 2022 Health Care Pressures Facing U.S. Employees report released today by Berkley Accident and Health a Berkley Company.

“Cost-sharing is a major problem for U.S. employees who are struggling with increased out-of-pocket costs due to high deductibles and coinsurance” said Brad N. Nieland President and CEO of Berkley Accident and Health. “These costs can place the largest burden on those who are least able to pay forcing patients to skip care self-pay and take on medical debt.”

Key findings of the survey:

Despite having health insurance respondents worry about their ability to pay for care with 84 percent concerned about affordability.

61 percent admit to skipping a medical test visit or prescription due to cost. 56 percent have paid cash because it was cheaper than using their insurance.

38 percent report having medical debt with the majority owing between $1000 and $10000. The top reason cited for medical debt was an unmet deductible or coinsurance.

Most respondents find health costs and billing hard to decipher. 69 percent have received a medical bill they did not expect – typically between $500 and $3000. Others found it hard to get a price estimate before scheduling a medical service or filling a prescription.

“With these findings in mind employers and benefit professionals should consider how they can make health care more affordable easier and more transparent for employees and their families” explained Nieland. Employee insights such as these can be key tools for shaping a company’s approach to health care. Health benefits which provide a competitive advantage when hiring should be an integral part of any long-term recruiting and retention strategy.

In addition to insurance protection Berkley Accident and Health also provides insights and advice for companies wanting to better support their workers. The report offered several strategies for addressing employees’ costs and concerns:

Review cost-sharing arrangements in light of average employee income levels and other factors

Consider a self-funded health plan or a group captive program (for small to midsize employers) which both offer significant economic and strategic advantages

Help address the complexity of care by offering price transparency tools and patient navigation services

“The goal of this report is to spark dialogue between employers and their benefit brokers. We hope it encourages employers to consider innovative solutions that can move the needle on costs and ease of use” concluded Nieland.

Methodology

The findings come from a survey commissioned in March 2022 of 1000 U.S. adults age 18 and older with employer-based health coverage balanced across age gender U.S. region and employer size. Respondents received medical coverage either as an employee or a covered dependent.

Given how ‘modern’ the brand’s gear sounds and how entrenched they are in modern rock genres you’d be forgiven for assuming that Mesa/Boogie was a relatively modern brand – far from it.

Mesa/Boogie’s history goes all the way back to the tail end of the swinging 60s being founded by California native Randall Smith in 1969 and spending the next 50 years creating amplifiers beloved by pro guitarists of every stripe and becoming one of the most famous names in amps in the process.

Berkley beginnings

Randall Smith was born in 1946 in Berkley California to a hugely talented musical family – his parents and sister were all part of the Oakland Symphony Orchestra. Early on Smith developed a love of electronics and before long was building ham radios and repairing record turntables his audiophile uncle donated to him – though remarkably he never actually studied electronics formally.

Despite Berkley being one of the US’s most famous college towns Smith attended UC Santa Barbara 300 miles away. Berkeley in the 60s was a hotbed of the counterculture and like many parents of that era Smith’s wanted him kept away from the influence of the students and faculty there.

Inevitably it didn’t work and every weekend Smith would hop a freight train back to the Berkley area to catch up with friends watch bands and attend Beat poetry performances in the town’s coffee houses.

After four years of studying humanities English literature and creative writing at Santa Barbara Smith returned to the San Francisco Bay area without graduating but with an itch to get involved in the city’s burgeoning music scene.

Smith had only learned a little saxophone and clarinet from his father growing up but decided that drums would be his way into the psychedelic San Fran scene and in the ensuing years he played in several bands around town.

Then in 1967 he opened Prune Music store which soon became a popular spot for the alternative crown in San Francisco. Despite still having no formal electronics training Smith set up an electronics shop in the back handling instrument repairs and mods while his business partner running the main shop up front

Jokes on you

Smith’s first amp build started out as a joke. Literally. As a practical joke played on a guitarist in a local band some mischievous scamps commissioned Smith to turn a 20-watt Fender Princeton into a 100-watt 1×12 – but to keep the Princeton’s aesthetics so the subject of the joke wouldn’t be alerted.

Smith duly got to work installing the amp section from a 100-watt Fender Bassman into the Princeton and the 10” speaker was swapped out for a 12”. But he needed someone to test it out to make sure the joke wouldn’t be a dud. Enter Carlos Santana.

Santana was browsing the wares at Prune Music when Smith approached him and asked him if he would try this amp out. Santana was reluctant assuming it was just another Princeton until Smith assured him that this was emphatically not any old Princeton.

Despite being created as a practical joke Santana came away from his encounter with Randall’s 100-watt 1×12 impressed and uttered the now famous line “Man that amp really boogies!” Soon the ‘joke’ amp was far from it – people raved about the tone and power of these pint-sized amps and he would eventually build over 200 of them christening them ‘Princeton Boogies’.

While he was building the amps Smith was also indulging in another of his hobbies moonlighting rebuilding the engines on Mercedes cars. In order to be able to buy both car parts and amp components at wholesale prices he created a nebulously vague company called ‘Mesa Engineering’ – he left the ‘Boogie’ part out because he wanted it to sound serious and official when sourcing Mercedes parts from Europe.

In actual fact Mesa was very nearly Marin Engineering instead – he only changed the name when he went to file the paperwork to make the company official and was told that the ‘Marin’ name was taken. He pulled out the name Mesa Engineering off the top of his head because he didn’t want to go to the back of the line!

Smith’s Princeton Boogies were a roaring success but his next innovation would be the one that would cement his place in amp history. One day Smith got a custom order from rock multi-instrumentalist Lee Michaels to build a preamp to drive his Crown power amps.

Smith decided to add an additional tube gain stage to this custom preamp with three variable gain controls placed throughout the circuit – Smith had invented what we now know as a cascading gain stage.

The preamp would be the world’s first true high-gain amp and soon after Smith decided to take the preamp design and combine it with what he’d learned about compact high-powered amps from the Princeton Boogies. The Mesa/Boogie Mark I was first released in 1972 and quickly became a choice for in the know pros – The Rolling Stones and Carlos Santana were early adopters. This star association soon established Mesa Engineering as one of the first boutique amp makers.

Over the next decade Smith made different versions of the Mark I that offered things like a parametric EQ reverb and different speaker variations. He also made some changes to the cabinet structure and in 1978 these all culminated in the release of the Mark II.

Over the decade Smith remarkably made over 3000 amps in his home shop which was still called Mesa Engineering though the amps themselves were branded as Boogies. Mark Series amps to this day still have the Boogie logo on them as an homage to everything the company achieved in those early years.

Rect yourself

By 1980 Mesa had moved from Smith’s home shop into a dedicated facility in Petaluma California – all Mesa/Boogie amps are still made in this shop to this day. Over the course of the 80s Boogie moved with the times and made everything from amp heads and combos to rackmount preamp and power amps.

If the Mark series had made Mesa/Boogie the choice of discerning pros in the 60s and 70s it would be another remarkable high-gain amp that would change the direction of the brand forever in the 1990s – the Rectifier.

The original Rectifier amp was itself inspired by a boutique high-gain icon of the 1980s – the legendary Soldano SLO. The Rectifier head offered perfect high-headroom high-gain tones for the wave of bands that would sweep along in the wake of grunge – in fact it was rare to see a nu-metal or pop-punk band in the mid-to-late 90s take the stage without also spotting the distinctive industrial steel faceplate of the Dual Rectifier in their backline.

A new era

The first two decades saw Mesa expand and refine the Rectifier concept to suit the needs of bands that required something a little different whether that be the compact Stiletto and Lone Star the stadium-ready Road King and even the tiny Mini-Rectifier head. The company also launched a line of well-received effects pedals in the early 2010s – including the valve-powered V-Twin.

In 2019 Mesa Engineering celebrated its 50th anniversary with a series of special edition amps including a gold-plated Triple Rectifier head were released to mark the occasion all while reminding the world of Mesa’s position as the most famous boutique amp brand.

Then in 2021 Mesa/Boogie changed forever. After more than five decades stewarding the company from the ground-up Mesa/Boogie was acquired by Gibson Brands becoming part of main man Cesar Gueikian’s revolution at the guitar giant.

At 75 many would have assumed that Smith would take the opportunity to put his feet up and bask in his success but he was having none of it – Smith was promptly installed as Master Designer & Pioneer of Mesa/Boogie and all of Gibson’s forthcoming amplifier projects. Not bad for someone who never took a single electronics course!

The deal announced Monday morning is valued at $8.9 billion and includes investments from Walgreens Boots Alliance and Cigna Corp's healthcare unit Evernorth which will also become a minority owner in VillageMD. Bloomberg first reported on a potential deal back in late October.

The deal will expand Walgreen's reach into primary specialty and urgent care. The transaction creates one of the largest independent provider groups in the U.S. the organizations said. Combined VillageMD and Summit Health will operate more than 680 provider locations in 26 markets. The two companies will have 20000 employees.

Walgreens said Monday it will invest $3.5 billion through an even mix of debt and equity to support the acquisition which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023. The company will remain the largest and consolidating shareholder of VillageMD with about 53% stake.

Walgreens also raised its fiscal year 2025 sales goal for its U.S. healthcare business to between $14.5 billion and $16 billion from $11 billion to $12 billion previously. That business segment is now expected to achieve positive adjusted EBITDA by the end of fiscal year 2023.

Last year Walgreens invested $5.2 billion in VillageMD and said it planned to open at least 600 Village Medical at Walgreens primary-care practices across the country by 2025 and 1000 by 2027.

The deal comes amid a frenzy of M&A activity in the past two years. Major retailers like CVS Walgreens and Amazon are ramping up their focus on providing medical services to gain bigger footholds in the healthcare market.

Drugstore rival CVS Health won the bidding war for home health and technology services company Signify Health and plans to shell out $8 billion to acquire the company. Amazon also plans to buy primary care provider One Medical for $3.9 billion.

The M&A move signals that Walgreens wants to become a ""dominant entity in the overall healthcare services ecosystem"" according to David Larsen healthcare IT and digital health analyst at financial services firm BTIG.

""Walgreens Boots Alliance is graduating up from being a drug retail store to owning the life-cycle of members' health"" he wrote in an analyst's note. ""We view this transaction as being a statement by the market that primary care continues to be one of the key drivers of healthcare long-term.""

The deal also will put additional pressure on CVS Health to break into the primary care business ""sooner rather than later"" Larsen wrote.

""I think at the most strategic level I think there continues to be recognition that an integrated coordinated connected model of care is one that will ultimately deliver the best results. You see this through Optum's acquisition of Kelsey-Seybold Clinic and VillageMD's acquisition of Summit Health"" Tim Barry CEO and chair of VillageMD said in an interview with Fierce Healthcare.

""If we're going to ultimately stem the rising tide of this fee-for-service healthcare system we need a better solution and that solution needs to have doctors working with other doctors in a coordinated way and trying to solve the unique problems that these patients have and making sure that the right doctors are accessing the patient at the right time and doing it all underneath the umbrella of a risk-based contract"" Barry said.

He added ""We think that this is going to continue to be where healthcare goes. And we have to do it in a way that is integrated and value-oriented. Any organization focused on doing that and doing that at size and scale is going to continue I think to be the successful winners of our healthcare system.""

In 2019 Summit Medical Group a physician-owned and governed multispecialty group merged with CityMD a leading urgent care company in New York City. The combined organization Summit Health has more than 370 locations in New Jersey New York Connecticut Pennsylvania and Oregon.

VillageMD provides value-based primary care for patients at traditional free-standing practices Village Medical at Walgreens practices at home and via virtual visits. VillageMD and Village Medical have grown to 22 markets and are responsible for more than 1.6 million patients according to the company.

Barry said the combination of VillageMD and Summit Health-CityMD will enable the organizations to scale up value-based care and build out integrated primary and specialty care services.

""If you look at the long history of Summit Health it's an organization that has done some very innovative things. The way that they deliver multispecialty care it is truly integrated it's truly connected and they are known as the preeminent brand in their marketplace. They also have CityMD which is one of the more unique and differentiated urgent care models out there in the market. They really are a best-of-breed organization"" he said.

""When I look at what we've been able to do at VillageMD we built this incredible model of value-based primary care delivery. The idea of bringing these two organizations together to bring those best-of-breed capabilities under one umbrella was just so compelling. We will soon be able to offer a more comprehensive integrated and connected model by also offering other specialty services to our patients but all still done through a value or risk-based reimbursement structure.""

Barry is bullish on the combined capabilities of the two companies in the primary and specialty care markets.

""We'll be delivering a consistent value-based model of integrated multispecialty care in a way that delivers the best clinical results on the planet"" he said.

Jeff Alter CEO of Summit Health-CityMD said in a statement that the deal adds Summit Health's expertise and geographic coverage to VillageMD’s proven value-based primary care approach.

The acquisition also expands Walgreens' reach into providing medical care directly to patients. ""This transaction accelerates growth opportunities through a strong market footprint and wide network of providers and patients across primary specialty and urgent care"" Roz Brewer CEO of Walgreens Boots Alliance said in a statement.

With Cigna's investment the combined company will be able to tap into Evernorth's health services capabilities to potentially lower healthcare costs Barry said. Evernorth encompasses Cigna's health services businesses including pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts

""In order to be a risk-based provider or a value-based provider you have to have contracts with a payer that allows you to work in this value or risk-based construct. We learned over the years that Cigna has been a really good partner to us on that journey"" Barry said.

""There are companies that [Cigna] has purchased over the years that have different specializations and capabilities that we believe ultimately will allow us to deliver better care to our patients"" he noted. ""Evernorth has some capabilities tied to behavioral health and they have some capabilities tied to the management of specialty pharmaceutical spend which everyone knows those costs continue to be soaring. We both liked the idea of supporting an organization like ours that's going to continue to grow and continues to be focused on risk and value.""

With the investment in VillageMD and Summit Health Cigna gets a leg up in the primary care space as it looks to build out its Evernorth division.

“Our collaboration with VillageMD accelerates our efforts to improve the way care is accessed and delivered” said Eric Palmer CEO of Evernorth in a statement. “Harnessing the breadth of Evernorth’s health services capabilities and connecting them with physicians who provide care in a value-based model like VillageMD helps more people to get the right care at the right time—driving better health and value.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2JydWNlamFwc2VuLzIwMjIvMTEvMDcvd2FsZ3JlZW5zLWJhY2tlZC12aWxsYWdlbWQtYW5kLWNpZ25hcy1ldmVybm9ydGgtdG8tYnV5LXN1bW1pdC1oZWFsdGgtZm9yLW5lYXJseS05LWJpbGxpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walgreens-Backed VillageMD And Cigna's Evernorth To Buy Clinic Operator Summit Health For Nearly $9 Billion,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2022/11/07/walgreens-backed-villagemd-and-cignas-evernorth-to-buy-summit-health-for-nearly-9-billion/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2JydWNlamFwc2VuLzIwMjIvMTEvMDcvd2FsZ3JlZW5zLWJhY2tlZC12aWxsYWdlbWQtYW5kLWNpZ25hcy1ldmVybm9ydGgtdG8tYnV5LXN1bW1pdC1oZWFsdGgtZm9yLW5lYXJseS05LWJpbGxpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzEzZDEyYjZlLTZmNzgtNDUxMS05YThhLWUyNWQyMDljZjRhMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walgreens affiliate in $9bn deal for doctors' group Summit Health,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

If you were a Democratic candidate running for federal office in the 1990s and early 2000s you probably wouldn't expect a dime from Walmart's political action committee which reserved most of its flourishing financial love for conservatives.

But as both Congress and the country have become increasingly polarized the Walmart Inc. PAC for Responsible Government also known as WALPAC has more evenly distributed its funds to both major parties according to an Insider analysis of political contribution data from the Federal Election Commission.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

During the 2021-2022 election cycle WALPAC has spread $956000 among 250 candidates running for federal office as of October 19 according to FEC records. Of that about 53% went to Republican candidates and 47% went to Democrats.

All of the PAC's federal-level donations went to incumbents running for re-election – including 41 to members of Congress who voted last year to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.

On its website Walmart explains that its PAC donations are made ""with the goal of ensuring our company can operate in the very best business environment possible so we can save our customers time and money.""

Walmart told Insider in a statement the company examines its ""political giving strategy"" at the end of every election cycle and ""after reassessing our giving strategy for months we decided to resume giving to select members of Congress who contested the 2020 election.""

""We've long believed we can more effectively advocate on behalf of our associates customers communities and shareholders by engaging with policymakers of both parties"" the company said. ""While our political contributions do not mean we support every view of an elected official we will contribute to those who are focused on issues important to our business and key stakeholders.""

That shift in how WALPAC makes political donations to parties on both sides of the aisle is ""indicative of a mature PAC"" compared to when it first formed in 1978 said Sheila Krumholz executive director of OpenSecrets a nonpartisan research organization that tracks political money.

""This is a traditional business PAC"" Krumholz told Insider. ""Business PACs are pragmatic and hedge their bets … the point of PAC donations is to give to incumbents or people who have jurisdiction over their industry or company and are in a position to extend a hand with their legislative agenda today.""

PACs that donate to multiple candidates can donate a maximum of $5000 per election or $10000 per cycle for a primary and general elections. WALPAC maxed out donations to seven incumbents this year:

Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick a Republican from Pennsylvania

Rep. Steven Horsford a Democrat from Nevada

Rep. Richard Neal a Democrat from Massachusetts

Rep. Kurt Schrader a Democrat from Oregon who lost his primary

Sen. John Boozman a Republican from Arkansas

Sen. Marco Rubio a Republican from Florida

Sen. John Thune a Republican from South Dakota

All seven hold positions on committees that could affect Walmart's business. Neal for example is the chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee responsible for initial hearing of bills regarding taxation. And Thune is the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Finance's Subcommittee on Taxation and IRS Oversight which has heard bills on how businesses like Walmart are taxed.

As per Insider's ""Conflicted Congress"" project there were 22 members of Congress who owned stock in Walmart as per their personal financial reports from 2020. Several of the 22 members of Congress including Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia received campaign contributions from Walmart's PAC while also holding stock in the company itself either personally or through a spouse.

Avoiding ideological extremes but backing election deniers

For the 2022 midterms WALPAC tended to donate to candidates closer to the political center instead of those on the ideological edges of their parties such as Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia or Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York — neither received a contribution.

Some members of Congress particularly among Democrats also reject any corporate PAC contribution — WALPAC or otherwise — as a matter of practice.

And with the exception of donations to Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto an incumbent who is in a dead heat with her Republican challenger Adam Laxalt WALPAC is largely staying out of swing state Senate races including those in Georgia and Pennsylvania.

WALPAC ""might have kind of a 'don't rock the boat' strategy' with its donations"" said Kyle Kondik managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics.

However the company did donate a significant amount of money to candidates who voted against certifying the 2020 presidential election results.

First in January 2021 following the insurrection at the US Capitol the company said that WALPAC would be ""indefinitely suspending contributions to those members of Congress who voted against the lawful certification of state electoral college votes.""

But by January 31 2022 WALPAC resumed giving donations to candidates who objected to certifying Democratic President Joe Biden's Electoral College victory over former Republican President Donald Trump according to ProPublica.

In all 147 Republican lawmakers voted to overturn the election.

Pro-Publica found that WALPAC spread at least $95000 among 41 of these candidates from late January of this year to the present. Total donations include $7500 to Republican Rep. Buddy Carter of Georgia and $5000 to Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California.

Walmart isn't alone in resuming political contributions to election deniers. AT&T Valero Energy and Aflac among many others all said in the aftermath of the insurrection they would suspend donations to those candidates only to turn around and continue filling their coffers for the midterms.

Krumholz of OpenSecrets said that Walmart and many others are choosing to support their bottom line instead of supporting democracy.

""The memory of January 6 is still fresh but it grows weaker every day"" Krumholz said. ""And (Walmart's) legislative priorities and concerns affecting their bottom line grow stronger and more diverse by the day.""

Regardless of who controls power on Capitol Hill come January — Democrats or Republicans — Walmart will be well-positioned to influence lawmakers off the campaign trail as well.

Walmart consistently ranks among the top federal lobbying spenders among retailers — usually in the range of $6 million to $8 million annually. In 2021 for example the National Retail Federation and CVS Health were the only other retail interests to spend more according to OpenSecrets.

This year Walmart has employed a small army of lobbyists — 61 of them to date — to help advocate for its policy priorities which involve trade consumer product safety taxation health labor transportation and environmental matters among others.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndyaWMuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9jaGVzdGVyZmllbGQtY291bnR5L21hbi1zaG90LW5lYXItY2hlc3RlcmZpZWxkLXNob3BwaW5nLWNlbnRlci1zdW5kYXktbmlnaHQv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3JpYy5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2NoZXN0ZXJmaWVsZC1jb3VudHkvbWFuLXNob3QtbmVhci1jaGVzdGVyZmllbGQtc2hvcHBpbmctY2VudGVyLXN1bmRheS1uaWdodC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shooting in Chesterfield Walmart parking lot leaves man fighting for life,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/chesterfield-county/man-shot-near-chesterfield-shopping-center-sunday-night/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndyaWMuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9jaGVzdGVyZmllbGQtY291bnR5L21hbi1zaG90LW5lYXItY2hlc3RlcmZpZWxkLXNob3BwaW5nLWNlbnRlci1zdW5kYXktbmlnaHQv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3JpYy5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2NoZXN0ZXJmaWVsZC1jb3VudHkvbWFuLXNob3QtbmVhci1jaGVzdGVyZmllbGQtc2hvcHBpbmctY2VudGVyLXN1bmRheS1uaWdodC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

All six episodes launch on the streaming service Wednesday November 9.

Zootopia+ heads back to the fast-paced mammal metropolis of Zootopia in a short-form series that dives deeper into the lives of some of the Oscara®--winning feature film’s most intriguing residents including Fru Fru the fashion-forward arctic shrew; ZPD dispatcher Clawhauser the sweet-toothed cheetah; and Flash the smiling sloth who’s full of surprises.

Zootopia+ is directed by Josie Trinidad and Trent Correy and produced by Nathan Curtis.

Episode descriptions are as follows:

1. “Hopp on Board”– When Judy boards the train from Bunny Burrow to Zootopia to begin her life as the big city’s first bunny cop Stu and Bonnie’s youngest daughter Molly hitches a ride atop the train forcing the down-to-earth duo out of their comfort zone and into an action-packed rescue mission.

2. “The Real Rodents of Little Rodentia”– Newly engaged Fru Fru kicks off wedding planning with enthusiasm and flourish—at least until her scene-stealing cousin Tru Tru arrives to assume the role of Shrew of Honor. A battle for the spotlight ensues until a close call with a giant donut reveals that for better or worse no one knows you better than family.

3. “Duke the Musical”– After being wrangled and arrested in a giant donut—compliments of Officer Judy Hopps—clever criminal weasel Duke reevaluates his life pondering where he went wrong—in song. In a musical aptly staged in his own mind Duke contemplates how to go from a small time crook to the Big Time!

4. “The Godfather of the Bride” – A touching tale about the powerful arctic shrew known as Mr. Big revisits Fru Fru’s big day when he delivers a revelatory father-of-the-bride speech. Taking guests back in time to his days as Mr. Small a new immigrant to Zootopia he imparts the wisdom he gained then about the importance of friends family and community.

5. “So You Think You Can Prance”– ZPD dispatcher Clawhauser persuades his boss Chief Bogo to audition for So You Think You Can Prance. The stakes are high as the ultimate prize is a dream-come-true opportunity to dance on stage with megastar pop sensation Gazelle.

6. “Dinner Rush”– As super server Sam urgently tries to finish her restaurant shift to make a once-in-a-lifetime Gazelle concert Flash and Priscilla show up at the last minute with hopes of a once-in-a-lifetime dinner.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndkd2luZm8uY29tL3dhbHQtZGlzbmV5LXdvcmxkL3RoaW5ncy1hdC13YWx0LWRpc25leS13b3JsZC10aGF0LW1ha2UtbWUtZmVlbC1ub3N0YWxnaWMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Things At Walt Disney World That Make me Feel Nostalgic,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.wdwinfo.com/walt-disney-world/things-at-walt-disney-world-that-make-me-feel-nostalgic/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndkd2luZm8uY29tL3dhbHQtZGlzbmV5LXdvcmxkL3RoaW5ncy1hdC13YWx0LWRpc25leS13b3JsZC10aGF0LW1ha2UtbWUtZmVlbC1ub3N0YWxnaWMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vVVMvZnVnaXRpdmUtY2FwdHVyZWQtZGlzbmV5LXdvcmxkLWluc3BlY3Rvci1zaWduZWQtYXJyZXN0LXdhcnJhbnQvc3Rvcnk_aWQ9OTI3NTkyNjXSAW5odHRwczovL2FiY25ld3MuZ28uY29tL2FtcC9VUy9mdWdpdGl2ZS1jYXB0dXJlZC1kaXNuZXktd29ybGQtaW5zcGVjdG9yLXNpZ25lZC1hcnJlc3Qtd2FycmFudC9zdG9yeT9pZD05Mjc1OTI2NQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fugitive captured at Disney World by inspector who signed his arrest warrant,"The suspect allegedly scammed the government out of COVID-19 relief fund.

Fugitive captured at Disney World by inspector who signed his arrest warrant

While a distinctive ""H"" tattooed on his neck may not stand for happiness a fugitive on the run for a year was captured in the ""Happiest Place on Earth"" according to authorities.

The wanted man Quashon Burton 32 of Brooklyn New York charged with scamming the government out of COVID-19 relief funds was on a family vacation at Disney World when he caught the eye of another park visitor -- the federal agent who signed his arrest warrant officials said.

While strolling around the park's Animal Kingdom U.S. Postal inspector Jeff Andre spotted the familiar inked letter on Burton's neck and alerted Disney World security and the Orange County Sheriff's Office who arrested Burton according to the sheriff's office.

Andre was involved in the investigation of Burton and had signed Burton's arrest warrant officials said.

The stroke of luck at the Orlando Florida park occurred on Oct. 20 according to the sheriff's office. After Burton left the park sheriff's deputies confronted him at a bus stop with two family members and took him into custody when he allegedly tried to resist arrest and gave them a fake name the sheriff's office said.

Burton was charged last year with stealing the identities of at least four people to fraudulently obtain almost $150000 in coronavirus relief loan applications according to federal authorities.

An arrest warrant was issued for Burton last November after federal agents went to his home in Brooklyn several times and his mother told them he was not planning to surrender officials said.

They were all hosted and created by Walt Disney himself and they are also missing from Disney+’s extensive backlog of entertainment options.

While the concept has had many different names and variations since its conception Disney has been a part of television history for decades. Before Disney was being continuously broadcasted aired streamed or constantly pumped onto our screens in one form or another any time a Disney-made show came on it was a special event often hosted by the man behind the mouse himself. While there were special airings of Walt’s feature films like Dumbo or Alice in Wonderland his anthology series also covered a number of original presentations documentaries and miniseries. Airing as early as the mid ’50s Walt’s various anthologies gave viewers an intimate and interesting dose of Disney on a weekly basis. The question is what happened and why have only a small handful of episodes made it to Disney+?

Although it is technically still on the air as The Wonderful World of Disney the original format and layout of the weekly Disney-focused airings have lost the formula set by the original runs. Granted this is largely due to the company living in a post-Walt world but that doesn’t mean attempts haven’t been made. ABC and NBC have had their contributions but nothing quite compares to the original episodes and special presentations. With the extensive archive of material at their disposal one would think that Disney would be chomping at the bit to release some of their founder’s material for a new audience.

While there are certain episodes like “The Plausible Impossible” and “The Story of the Animated Drawing” are readily available this is only a very small fraction of Walt’s work from the series. Since his original contributions spanned from around 1954 until his death Disney should have more of their founders original programming even with the airings of his feature films out of the picture. Even without the theatrically released features Walt Disney’s TV projects included such icons of TV as Davy Crockett Zorro and rarer series like The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh (still currently locked away in the Disney vault) and all deserve to be seen in their entireties.

While this might primarily appeal to older Disney+ subscribers or the average armchair-historians there is a wealth of entertainment still not available on the service. While there is certainly no crime against showing more new and modern material it’s always important to get back to basics. Now that a wider audience can experience some of the company’s best work it’s time to introduce the anthology to a new generation.

Merged version of HBO Max and Discovery+ streaming services now arriving next spring

Company expects restructuring to be substantially completed by end of 2024

Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) has reported revenue of US$9.8 billion in the third quarter of 2022 representing a year-over-year (YoY) decrease of eight per cent for the media giant.

The company’s net loss for the three month period ended 30th September was US$2.3 billion. Adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) was down eight per cent YoY to US$2.4 billion.

WBD’s various networks including Eurosport and TNT pulled in revenue of US$5.2 billion for Q3 a fall of eight per cent YoY. Content revenue in the segment decreased 37 per cent primarily driven by the sublicensing of broadcast rights in Europe for the delayed Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games last year although this was partially offset by higher inter-segment licensing.

The number of global direct-to-consumer (DTC) subscribers increased by 2.8 million to 94.9 million however revenue dropped six per cent YoY to US$2.3 billion.

Additionally WBD ended Q3 with US$2.5 billion of cash on hand and US$50.4 billion of gross debt.

The figures are the second set of financial results since the company’s multibillion dollar merger earlier this year. The results missed analyst expectations with WBD feeling the effects of a slowdown in advertising and costs associated with its post-merger restructuring. The company has been looking to cut costs with a major wave of layoffs in its advertising sales arm part of the overhaul.

As reported by CNBC the restructuring is expected to be ‘substantially completed’ by the end of 2024 and will incur approximately US$3.2 billion to US$4.3 billion in total pre-tax restructuring charges.

Another notable highlight in the quarter was the completion of a joint-venture between WBD and telecommunications provider BT which will combine the assets of pay-TV network BT Sport and Eurosport to create a new sports offering for the UK and Ireland.

“At Warner Bros Discovery we have one of the strongest portfolio of assets and IP across sports news and entertainment and the best leadership team in media executing against the right strategy and financial framework to drive profitability generate meaningful shareholder value and ultimately position us for long-term success” said David Zaslav (pictured above) president and chief executive of WBD.

“We are reimagining and transforming the organisation for the future while driving synergy enterprise-wide increasing our target to at least US$3.5 billion and making significant progress on our combined DTC product.

“While we have lots more work to do and there are some difficult decisions still to be made we have total conviction in the opportunity ahead.”

Zaslav also announced that the planned merger of its HBO Max and Discovery streaming platforms will now launch as a single service in spring 2023 having initially been earmarked for next summer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMi0QFodHRwczovL3diZC5jb20vd2FybmVyLWJyb3MtZGlzY292ZXJ5LXNwb3J0cy10by1mZWF0dXJlLWZvdXItb2YtZ29sZnMtYmlnZ2VzdC1uYW1lcy10aWdlci13b29kcy1yb3J5LW1jaWxyb3ktanVzdGluLXRob21hcy1qb3JkYW4tc3BpZXRoLWluLWxhdGVzdC1lZGl0aW9uLW9mLWNhcGl0YWwtb25lcy10aGUtbWF0Y2gtc2F0dXJkYXktZGVjLTEwLWF0LTYtcC1tLWV0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warner Bros.

If Warner Bros Discovery has no joy bringing the Harry Potter films back to life there are other family franchises that the studio could turn to.

OUR BEST EVER SUBSCRIPTION OFFER! Try three issues of Film Stories magazine – for just £1!: right here!

You might have heard that Warner Bros – or Warner Bros Discovery as we must now call them – is having a bit of a time. The studio has been part of a megabillions merger the kind of money that instantly turns films into ‘content’ and phrases such as ‘job losses’ are replaced by ‘synergies’.

On the film side the studio has – contrary to reports – been doing interesting work this year. But also it’s been deleting all-but-completed films from its servers to take the tax write-off money instead and the new boss of the company – David Zaslav a man who is unlikely to receive an honorary Oscar anytime soon – is looking to reliable franchises rather than risk taking for his pension pot.

Thing is he’s been talking about another Harry Potter and on behalf of most of us who sat through the last two Fantastic Beasts­ films we’d suggest a pause there. Instead the studio is awash with untapped family movie franchises or dormant ones awaiting a reboot/reimagining/rehash/regurgitation.

To help Mr Zaslav in such challenging times therefore we’ve gone through the back catalogue and tried to help him identity the projects that might move the needle and let him think back inside the box.

Here then are some quick wins as part of our new holistic strategy for Warner Bros Discovery. Let the er synergies commence!

Yogi Bear 2: Coming Soon

In spite of inspired marketing and the Best Movie Poster Of All Time ™ it remains a modern-day scandal that we never got a sequel to the tired Yogi Bear movie.

Let’s be clear: nobody’s crying out for the movie itself but as an audit for how the modern Warner Bros Discovery marketing machine compares with the old Warner Bros set-up it might just be priceless. After all there are questions that can be asked: did Yogi and Boo Boo get it on? Did Office Dibble uncover what the pair secreted in their picnic baskets? Can the sequel repeat the $200m of global business – yep honestly – of the original?

The world is waiting. Suggested tagline: The best things still come in bears.

The Iron Giant Returns



We saw a glimpse of this at the premiere for Steven Spielberg’s Ready Player One where the wonderful giant from The Iron Giant was pictured with those guns that the film was er very much trying to push. Here’s a piece from the time questioning why violence was being reintroduced for the character. The answer? Surely it’s priming the audience for the sequel!

This then is a fresh new direction for Warner Bros Discovery to take things. Never mind that the original masterpiece was a film that showed a calmer way forward in life let the sequel – and don’t get anyone like Brad Bird involved – instead give the audience the action they want! Give the tinpot bugger a ton of ammunition and let him tear the screen! What do you mean running roughshod over the spirit of the original? Pah we’ve got corporate targets to hit here.

Note to executive: see if there’s potential for a crossover with the Terminator universe. We could get a cinematic universe out of this.

Police Academy 4: Citizens On Patrol II

Been thinking about this. The fourth – and best obviously – Rocky film is Rocky IV (comments disabled don’t). And if you think about it Rocky IV got a pretty direct sequel with Creed 2. As such whilst I won’t take a bullet for Police Academy 4 being the best of that particular saga let’s follow the logic. A direct follow-up to Police Academy 4: Citizens On Patrol would inevitably have to follow Sharon Stone’s character Claire Mattson given she’s the highest profile member of the supporting cast. Get Bobcat Goldthwait in to direct this and we’re in business. And then given the commitment to international franchises now let the city that the cadets patrol this time be somewhere like Coventry. HBO Max will love this shit.

Robin Hood: King Of Thieves

Even though 1991’s Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves is now a 12 certificate movie much to the regret of the BBFC in the UK it went into cinemas originally with a PG. Given the affection that the film remains held in this is the obvious candidate for a soulless sequel to strip the heart out of it repackage it and sell in a double pack with the original

Jeremy Irons is going to have to step in as the brother of the Sheriff Of Nottingham and given that Kevin Costner is knee-deep in other projects it’s likely going to be Chris Pratt landing the role of Robin this time around obviously elevated from Prince to Thieves to King. A call needs to go in to Bryan Adams to see if he’s up for another Very Long Song too.

If all this doesn’t pan out just get Christian Slater back for a brotherly spin-off Will Hood: Prince Of Thieves. Count the money David! KERCHING.

The Never Ending Story IV

It feels right that this particular saga should continue and it’d presumably allow some cross-contamination of corporate efforts in that surely people are already expecting another film given the obvious. As such there’s some economising here are the studio would barely need to sell the thing. Just put it out there! You told everyone the bugger would never end. Get a TV show moving while you’re at it.

Free Willys

Taking inspiration from how James Cameron successfully built on Ridley Scott’s Alien movie for the modern classic Aliens so the resurrection of the Free Willy saga can go forward with an obvious plan: more Willys.

Let’s up the ante! Why free one Willy when there are lots and lots out there waiting to be unleashed? Teach a family audience about how you shouldn’t keep Willys in captivity and show them how they can gush their way into the wider world. Just imagine the family activity packs that could be produced? This has potential too for spin-off books and maybe a touring live show where the story of Willys can be discussed in more details.

Oh hang on David! That’s the merchandising team on line two – they’ve got some ideas! Back soon we’re on a winner here…

The Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives says better segregation composting and recycling waste could cut the sector’s total emissions by 84%.

Methane is a major by-product of waste and is responsible for 16% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

With the world’s population rapidly approaching 8 billion the waste we produce is a growing problem.

Each person on the planet generates an average of 0.74 kilograms of waste a day. However this estimate by the World Bank includes data ranging from 0.11kilograms to 4.54 kilograms with high-income countries producing more than a third of the 2.01 billion tonnes of global waste generated annually.

The world’s methane problem

The things we throw away create many by-products and methane is one of the worst offenders. More potent than CO2 it’s responsible for as much as 16% of global greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs).

Methane is responsible for around 30% of the rise in global temperatures since the industrial revolution according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Waste was the fourth leading source of methane emissions in 2021 producing 73 megatonnes it says.

The waste sector is responsible for 20% of global methane emissions and 3.3% of global greenhouse gas emissions according to a new report 'Zero Waste to Zero Emissions: How Reducing Waste is a Climate Gamechanger ' from the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives (GAIA). The report explains that waste management methods can help the world fight global warming in three ways: climate mitigation adaptation and additional societal benefits.

Reforming the sector could cut global methane emissions by 13%.

Reducing global emissions from waste

Waste reduction solutions like segregation composting and recycling could reduce the sector’s total emissions by 84% according to the report. This is equivalent to taking all US motor vehicles off the road for a year.

Such approaches could be extended to other sectors: “At least 70% of global emissions come from the manufacture transport use and disposal of goods and a focus on waste reduction could significantly reduce the emissions in these sectors too” says GAIA.

Zero-waste solutions can also help cities become more resilient to the existing impacts of climate change by mitigating floods reducing disease transmission and improving soil quality.

How zero-waste solutions can help cities

More than 550 municipalities around the world are currently implementing zero-waste policies according to the report.

Business-as-usual and zero-waste scenarios were modelled to ascertain the potential waste emissions reductions of eight cities in a range of sizes and with different resources and climatic conditions as detailed in the chart below.

A new study shows how the world’s cities can use waste-reduction solutions to drastically reduce their emissions. Image: GAIA

On average the eight cities modelled generated an 84% reduction in GHG emissions.

South Korea’s capital Seoul could potentially see the biggest GHG reduction in a zero-waste scenario the report’s case studies reveal. Its current waste system however is already net-negative due to a robust separate collection and recycling system. The city also has little food waste going into landfills.

The majority of Seoul’s GHG emissions come from incinerators the report’s researchers say. If these are phased out together with its other waste solutions efforts the city could save more than 885% of annual GHG emissions or more than 538 tonnes of CO2.

The case studies revealed several commonalities between the countries most significant of which was the benefits that could come from correct management of organic waste: “In all the cities we analyzed except Seoul separate collection and treatment of organics has the greatest potential to reduce GHG emissions.”

Landfill use is found to be the biggest source of emissions in several cities the findings show. By moving away from this method Detroit could lower waste-sector emissions by 102% Temuco by 73% Dar es Salaam by 65% and Bandung by half.

No time to waste at COP27

More than 25% of countries’ current climate plans neglect the waste sector and now is the time for global leaders to take bold and urgent action GAIA says. At the COP27 climate conference currently underway in Sharm el-Sheikh Egypt such issues will be addressed. The host nation is putting forward the ‘Africa Waste 50’ initiative which plans to recycle and treat 50% of all waste produced in Africa by 2050.

“Previous climate talks have largely overlooked the potential of reforms to the waste sector particularly for reducing methane which over 100 countries have now pledged to do. Zero waste strategies are the easiest way to rapidly and cheaply bring down emissions while building climate resilience creating jobs and promoting thriving local economies” stated Mariel Vilella co-author of the report and director of GAIA’s Global Climate Program.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3dhc3RlLW1hbmFnZW1lbnQtd29ybGQuY29tL3Jlc291cmNlLXVzZS9pc3dhLWhpZ2hsaWdodHMtdGhlLXJvbGUtb2YtdGhlLXdhc3RlLWFuZC1yZXNvdXJjZXMtbWFuYWdlbWVudC1zZWN0b3ItdG8tbWl0aWdhdGUtY2xpbWF0ZS1jaGFuZ2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ISWA highlights the role of the waste and resources management sector to mitigate climate change | WMW,"""ISWA is represented at this years`s COP by its president Carlos Silva Filho as well as its managing director Marc Tijhuis. “The Declaration on Climate Change and the Waste and Resource Management Sector” issued just before COP27 emphasises the strong conviction that the waste and resource sector offer considerable and immediate cost-effective opportunities and do have a great potential to mitigate global greenhouse gas emissions. While allowing for the implementation of low carbon technologies the transition to Circular Economy also offers new economic opportunities"" says Arne Ragossnig ISWA Vice-President.



The single most important contribution to climate protection can be achieved by solving the open burning and open dumping of waste.



These three messages have been prepared by the Scientific and Technical Committee of ISWA together with the Board of Directors followed by a feedback loop with the National Members of ISWA.



The result is a strong statement and firm commitment of the global waste sector to continue to combat the release of greenhouse gases resulting from waste and to continue providing secondary resources allowing for greenhouse gas emission reductions in producing industries.""





Key Messages

The waste and resource management sector offers a considerable and immediate cost-effective opportunity to mitigate global greenhouse gas emissions. Policies that encourage the transition to a circular economy are not detrimental to economic growth and offer opportunities to establish innovative low-carbon technologies and markets for secondary raw materials contributing to a net zero future. Solving open burning and open dumping of waste and plastic pollution on both land and in the oceans can increase action against climate change.

We the International Solid Waste Association (ISWA):

Recognise that climate change is one of the greatest threats facing humanity contributing

to the triple planetary crisis of climate disruption biodiversity loss and increased pollution already impacting people and ecosystems;

Acknowledge that we need to urgently apply both mitigating and adapting measures to avoid unprecedented consequences;

Emphasize that transitioning to a circular economy improving waste management practices and providing a more resourceful approach has a total mitigation potential of around 20% of global GHG emissions.

Endorse the universal human right to a clean healthy and sustainable environment;

Welcome the Global Methane Pledge launched at COP 26 and continuously collaborate to its full implementation to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030;

Consider that extreme weather conditions linked to climate change will exacerbate the spread of plastics in the natural environment and also maximize the consequences of other negative impacts in environmental quality including biodiversity loss and pollution;

Support the negotiation process to develop a legally binding agreement to mitigate plastic pollution as an important instrument to improve environmental quality and tackle GHG emissions.

Hereby declare:

The waste and resource management sector offer both an immediate and cost-effective opportunity to achieve substantial cuts in global Short-Lived Climate Forcers (SLCFs)1 and carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions also to achieve savings in other economic sectors and thus must be part of implementing the portfolio of solutions for mitigation and adaptation to reduce global emissions essential to reaching climate neutrality. Policies that encourage the transition to a circular economy are not detrimental to economic growth and offer opportunities to establish innovative low-carbon technologies and markets for secondary raw materials contributing towards a net zero future Solving open burning and open dumping of waste and plastic pollution on both land and in the oceans can increase action against climate change.

Therefore the National Members of ISWA convened at its General Assembly the governing body of the International Solid Waste Association an Observer Organization of the UNFCCC and UNEP call upon Governments Industries Multilateral and International Organizations NGOs and the Civil Society to:

Prioritize sustainable and integrated waste and resources management strategies and a circular economy in national plans and initiatives for climate mitigation and adaptation including Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and climate finance mechanisms. Mobilize and scale up public and private funds to implement sound and low carbon waste and resources management systems and technologies in order to stop and close all inadequate operations (e.g. open burning and open dumping of waste). Develop a combination of economic instruments to finance climate mitigation and adaptation measures including structuring a global market to trade methane reduction credits from waste operations in order to achieve the Global Methane Pledge goal Intensify support and maximize investments to identify control and mitigate land-based sources of plastics contributing to ocean pollution.

To accomplish these objectives the International Solid Waste Association (ISWA) through its members its Board Scientific and Technical Committee Working Groups and the General Secretariat commits to:

Enhance cooperation with international agencies governments and other organizations to extend access to adequate waste management systems to all citizens and support the transition to a circular economy. Support cities municipalities and regions on targeted and tangible actions to mitigate GHG emissions and tackle plastic pollution encouraging the development and the implementation of policies and actions to mitigate climate change tackle plastic pollution and establish a low carbon economy. Collaborate with the private sector along the entire value chain on establishing good waste and resource management practices across materials and products lifecycle improving design and production patterns setting better Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) indicators and supporting the transition to a circular economy aiming at reducing the overall footprint towards a net-zero future. Work towards the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs as a significant contribution to a healthy environment and the mitigation of GHG and plastic pollution. Contribute to the advancement of technical and scientific knowledge about sustainable waste and resource management oriented to mitigate GHG emissions and to reduce plastic pollution through research capacity building and disseminating successful experiences.

This rings true more than ever today as the world faces a triple planetary crisis of climate change nature and biodiversity loss pollution and waste.

More climate data is available than ever before but how that data is accessed interpreted and acted on is crucial to managing these crises. One technology that is central to this is Artificial Intelligence (AI).

So what exactly does AI mean?

""AI refers to systems or machines that perform tasks that typically require human intelligence and can iteratively improve themselves over time based on the information they collect"" says David Jensen coordinator of the United Nations Environment Program's (UNEP's) Digital Transformation sub-programme.

Jensen highlights several areas where AI can play a role in tackling environmental challenges from designing more energy-efficient buildings to monitoring deforestation to optimizing renewable energy deployment.

""This can be on a large scale – such as satellite monitoring of global emissions or a more granular scale – such as a smart house automatically turning off lights or heat after a certain time"" he adds.

Informing real-time analysis

Image: UNEP

UNEP's World Environment Situation Room (WESR) launched in 2022 is one digital platform that is leveraging AI's capabilities to analyze complex multifaceted datasets.

Supported by a consortium of partners WESR curates aggregates and visualizes the best available earth observation and sensor data to inform near real-time analysis and future predictions on multiple factors including CO2 atmospheric concentration changes in glacier mass and sea level rise.

""WESR is being developed to become a user-friendly demand-driven platform that leverages data into government offices classrooms Mayor's offices and boardrooms” says Jensen. “We need credible trustworthy and independent data to inform decisions and drive transparency – WESR provides this” he adds.

“Over time the goal is for WESR to become like a mission control centre for planet earth where all of our vital environmental indicators can be seamlessly monitored to drive actions.”

Monitoring methane emissions

One of the UNEP-led initiatives inside the WESR digital ecosystem is the International Methane Emissions Observatory (IMEO) which leverages AI to revolutionize the approach to monitoring and mitigating methane emissions.

The platform operates as a global public database of empirically verified methane emissions. It leverages AI to strategically interconnect this data with action on science transparency and policy to inform data-driven decisions.

“IMEO’s technology allows us to collect and integrate diverse methane emissions data streams to establish a global public record of empirically verified methane emissions at an unprecedented level of accuracy and granularity” Jensen says.

“Reducing the energy sector’s methane emissions is one of the quickest most feasible and cost-effective ways to limit the impacts of climate warming and reliable data-driven action will play a big role in achieving these reductions” he adds.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndvd3QuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvMDcvb21haGEteWFyZC13YXN0ZS1jb2xsZWN0aW9uLXN0aWxsLWZhY2luZy1kZWxheXMv0gFfaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud293dC5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS8wNy9vbWFoYS15YXJkLXdhc3RlLWNvbGxlY3Rpb24tc3RpbGwtZmFjaW5nLWRlbGF5cy8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Omaha yard waste collection still facing delays,"OMAHA Neb. (WOWT) - Omaha’s yard waste services are behind schedule.

The city has completed two weeks of its fall yard waste season.

It’s a free program where individuals can put as much yard waste as they’d like in bags to be collected free of charge.

However the program doesn’t come without issues. According to Omaha Public Works yard waste collection is running behind schedule.

Public Works says anyone who didn’t have their bags collected should keep them on the curb for the next day. Crews will also work Saturday to get caught up on collections.

Residents can also call the Solid Waste Hotline at 402-444-4938 if their bags aren’t collected by the day following their normal day of service.

The fall yard waste collection season is from Oct. 24 to Dec. 2. Paper yard waste bags will be collected and composted free of charge during the season. No sticker is required on yeard waste bags but bundles of brush will still need a sticker.

Yard waste can be placed in a black-lid waste cart at any time of the year.

Your mileage on Eric Clapton might vary these days. The legendary blues rocker certainly has a hell of a resumé behind his 60-year career in the music industry. If you don’t like Cream or Blind Faith or some of Clapton’s early solo work then there’s just nothing I can do for you – that’s just good music.

But as old rich guys tend to be Clapton has said and done quite a few stupid things over the years. From racist outbursts to bad takes on everything from Brexit to Covid-19 Clapton is in that curmudgeonly end-phase of a legendary career where he’s putting his own legacy in jeopardy if he decides not to just keep his mouth shut.

No matter how you feel about the guitarist Clapton is still probably one of the first names that come up when talking about blues rock. Clapton is a true devotee of the form even leaving The Yardbirds when he felt like his preferred blues style was being put to the side in order to play pop music. Clapton studied some of the greatest including Robert Johnson and Elmore James but it was Muddy Waters who made one of the biggest impacts.

As a major concert draw throughout his life as a singer Clapton has occasionally reached out to Waters to perform on stage with him. Even when they’re not collaborating directly Waters and Clapton tended to float around each other’s orbit like when both performed during The Band’s legendary final concert The Last Waltz.

When Clapton appeared on the BBC programme Desert Island Discs back in 1989 he was tasked with choosing just eight songs to take with him. Some obvious choices followed including cuts from Robert Johnson and Freddie King along with some curveballs from Stevie Wonder and Prince. But when it came to Waters Clapton chose a stone-cold classic ‘Feel Like Going Home’.

This a part of a long and continuing story and it first appeared in January 2019 and is reprinted in honor of the discovery of the DIAMOND LADY in the shrinking water of the Mississippi River behind President’s Island in Memphis.

By Capt. Don Sanders

Special to NKyTribune

When I joined the DL’s crew just before the first anniversary of the day I watched as Vanna cut the ribbon on April Fool’s day in 1991 gambling was booming on all three of the Quad City casino boats. Besides the DIAMOND LADY at Bettendorf the PRESIDENT a historical sidewheeler on the National Register of historic places was working out of nearby Davenport Iowa. Across the river in Rock Island Illinois Jumer’s CASINO ROCK ISLAND one of the most lovely of all the casino boats built was treating Illinois passengers to “unlimited gaming” while Iowa had an ill-conceived $200 loss limit per cruise.

At first the no-holds-barred style of gambling on the east side of the Mississippi seemed not to affect the boats on the west bank adversely but soon I noticed a decline in the number of patrons promenading aboard. And when I overheard two Blackjack dealers lamenting about getting turned down for a car loan when the lender found they were casino employees aboard our boat I knew there was trouble. Before all the concerns became daily newspaper fodder an atmosphere of panic gripped the workers who bet their futures on the DIAMOND LADY.

As early as the end of May 1992 Steamboat Development our parent company announced in a news dispatch that “the last Iowa cruise for the two boats (DL & EL) will be July 5.” Steamboat further publicized plans to “take its two Mississippi River gambling boats south to Mississippi to escape Iowa’s betting restrictions and to try to stem multimillion-dollar losses.”

Between the announcement and the established last day the company was in a free-fall business and employee-wise. Where earlier the DL was going out with a full complement of paying passengers as the deadline for cruises neared most of the few arriving busloads were seniors shuttled from Chicago some 175 miles to the east enjoying a free roundtrip coach ride a free buffet and ten dollars in complimentary cash. Most of the riders I heard slept both ways on the bus gorged the buffet meal and then cashed-in the ten dollar comp and kept the money. There was even talk in the papers that disgruntled employees planned on dropping bricks on the boat as it passed under the Centennial Bridges on its way out of town.

Our deckhands were jumping ship so quickly that the U. S. Coast Guard paid us a surprise visit and held a headcount to make sure we weren’t padding our muster rolls and claiming we had a full complement of hands when we were short-handed. Before the Coasties left after finding everyone accountable they warned us on the threat of losing our licenses not to pad the roster even if the company asked. Never I must add did anyone above me ever request that I do anything illegal. Perhaps a disgruntled crew member fed the USCG what today is called “fake news.” No more was ever said one way or another but we cautiously made sure we had a full staff aboard whenever we sailed.

Even I came under suspicion by some unhappy employees who were about to lose their livelihoods. Many were about to have their automobiles repossessed and others would soon be unable to afford their homes or apartments once the boat ceased operating. A silly rumor surfaced alleging that as I came to the boat from Mississippi and that the casino business turned for the worse soon after my arrival I somehow had an influence on all the misfortunes locals were experiencing relating to the shutdown of the boat and its subsequent plans to move everything to Biloxi Mississippi about a three-and-a-half drive from where my family awaited without me. The rumor was so unfounded that it was no more than a whisper and faded as quickly as it appeared.

Once the casino ceased operations the Marine crew began preparing the DIAMOND LADY for the long trip. The first stop would be Pascagoula Mississippi for some structural watertight bulkheads additions in the hull of the LUCKY SEVEN ticket barge the DL would be pushing ahead of her. Afterward we planned to meet our sister boat the EMERALD LADY and arrive in Biloxi together in a grandly orchestrated entrance of the first two gambling boats in that city on the Gulf Coast.

Twin tow-knees welded to the sharp model bow of the DIAMOND LADY allowed the casino boat to shove the two-story ticket barge ahead of the paddlewheeler. Both were filled from top to bottom with everything the fledgling southern operation would need to sprout from its Iowa roots. However everything identifiable with the Bettendorf casino such as brochures pamphlets posters and all other printed materials – even the items sold in the gift shop with DIAMOND LADY logos and names were loaded into 40-yard dumpsters and hauled off to a landfill.

A portable metal shredder arrived from Las Vegas and chewed-up the unique slot machine tokens and what remained were no more than small chunks of metal bound for Mr. Goldstein’s scrap yard. I have often wished that I had salvaged some of the DIAMOND LADY stuff as keepsakes of a memorable boat but little remains other than that acquired before the purge. My only memento of note is a beautiful shiny blue coffee mug with the boat’s name and likeness inscribed upon it that I just gave to Captain John H. Vize’s cup collection.

The next to the last day the DIAMOND LADY was in Bettendorf efforts were underway to unfasten the ticket barge from its moorings to the city front. Things were progressing slowly without a competent leader to coordinate the combined efforts of the company employees and the crew of the small towboat LONE STAR belonging to Blackhawk Fleet another Bernie Goldstein operation until unannounced a taxi pulled up amidst all the confusion and out stepped a well-dressed Captain Ken Murphy carrying a single suitcase in tow.





Captain Ken who had just arrived from the airport immediately accessed the situation and stowed his grip on the deck of the ticket barge. Seeing me he ordered:

“Hey old boy… get yourself a pair of gloves and stick close with me.”

Like an orchestra leader conducting a symphony Captain Murphy assumed leadership of the operation while I was alongside him following his every command as others fell into step with his directions. The Blackhawk Fleet fellows knew Murph and were only too glad to finally have a leader aboard who knew what he was doing. And in the space of a couple of hours the barge was untied from the shore connections and wired into place ahead of the DIAMOND LADY. All those going on the long boat ride were told to be aboard and ready to leave town the first thing the next morning.



When one of my deckhands asked what I would do if like them I would be losing my job once the boat reached Biloxi and chose not to stay with the boat for whatever unexplained reason I replied that I would become a pirate. I went on to describe my choice of having to be a Buccaneer for lack of other employment. And by a strange coincidence inside my suitcase I carried a baseball cap with a mustached bust of a freebooter with the name “PIRATES” embroidered in gold thread beneath him.

Within a half-hour one of my boys displayed a pirate flag he’d made from a black cloth sack he found below. And before we traveled much further downstream my lot of sad fellows transformed themselves into a crew of high-spirited privateers and remained so until the DIAMOND LADY tied up for the last time at Biloxi overlooking the Gulf of Mexico and they chose not to stay with the boat and returned home to Iowa.





By the time the morning fog lifted the strange looking tow was easing away from where it had been waiting for daylight. Again Captain Murphy showed his boat-handling magic when he effortlessly eased the ungainly-looking arrangement into the large chamber at Rock Island Lock & Dam 15; proving that both the DIAMOND LADY and the bulky LUCKY SEVEN were manageable in a tight situation.



As the boat and barge paddled underneath Centennial Bridge many former casino employees crowded along the handrailing and instead of bricks raining down as was feared the well-wishes and farewell greetings from our unemployed brothers and sisters bade us farewell as the DIAMOND LADY paddled into the unfathomed waters of uncertainty ahead.

Now the same hedge fund manager that exposed the Chinese company’s shady accounting practices which subsequently got its stock delisted from the Nasdaq in 2020 is actually backing the coffee chain.

It's “a miracle in China’s business history” he said.

What Happened: Sean Ma founder and manager of Beijing-based hedge fund Snow Lake Capital anonymously penned a report back in 2020 exposing fraud at Luckin.

Since then Ma has changed his tune telling the Wall Street Journal that his fund purchased a minority stake in the Chinese coffee chain predicting that the company’s valuation is going to surge.

“I never would have thought the company could come back. Many nearly impossible things happened” Ma said.

Brief History: When Luckin debuted on the Nasdaq in May 2019 analysts predicted it would outperform the rest of the market by satisfying Chinese consumers' desire for an alternative to Starbucks.

Months after its debut in January an email started showing up in the inboxes of several traders and companies that specialize in short-selling days after the stock price reached a record high (about $50) valuing the company at $12 billion.

Enter Ma’s Snow Lake Capital enter Muddy Waters.

The report which was later identified as coming from Snow Lake Capital and published by Muddy Waters proved that some of its former executives and employees fabricated more than $300 million in sales with the company confirming that as much as $310 million of its 2019 sales were fabricated.

The company agreed to Nasdaq's decision to delist the stock later in June 2020.

Comeback Story: Shortly after the fraud was identified the company ousted its co-founder Charles Zhengyao Lu and made other changes to its board of directors.

Emerging from bankruptcy in March this year Luckin’ is now controlled by Beijing-based private-equity firm Centurium Capital.

Now valued at $4.4 billion Luckin’ has resumed its expansion in China according to the Journal opening stores and nonfraudulently growing its sales.

It reported $107 million in net profit in 2021.

Designed by Canadian naval architecture firm Robert Allan Ltd (RAL) Sentinel 303 and Sentinel 304 will be delivered to WCMRC by the end of this year.

Classed by the American Bureau of Shipping the non-self-propelled barges will join WCMRC’s fleet of pollution response vessels stationed along the south coast of British Columbia.

Each barge has an LOA of 76 metres a moulded beam of 20 metres a depth of 6.4 metres a maximum draught of 4.6 metres a gross tonnage of 2822 and capacity for 3785 cubic metres of recovered oil.

The accommodation spaces on each barge are outfitted to high MLC-compliant standards for a crew of up to 20 personnel. The ten double cabins are located on the accommodation deck along with the galley a mess/lounge and an office/control room located on the fo’c’sle deck.

The electrical plant comprises four identical Caterpillar C4.4 diesel generators each with a power output of 118 ekW.

The aft deck is the main working deck and contains all the oil spill response equipment. The spill containment systems consist of four unsheltered booms stored in containers with hydraulic reels current busters stored in a single container with hydraulic reels and four containers of general-purpose boom. There is also ample storage for absorbents mission-specific containers general equipment decontamination gear dry storage and a containerised workspace.

Two small vessel docks are stored onboard and can be deployed on port and starboard sides to allow other response vessel crews to embark/disembark to and from the response barges and facilitates the transfer of recovered oil from the response vessels to the response barge. A Desmi Terminator skimmer and hose reel allows the response barges to recover oil floating on the surface. Two mini storage barges are stowed on deck and can be deployed in the field to aid in the response.

A Norcrane fixed-boom crane with an SWL of nine tonnes at 19 metres is fitted aft to handle the above-mentioned oil spill response gear and hoses."

Elizabeth Warren calls Wells Fargo CEO 'evasive' presses bank for fraud complaints on Zelle payment platform,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren called Wells Fargo CEO Charles Scharf ""evasive"" saying the bank's answers to her questions about fraud across the Zelle payment platform were misleading ""insulting and useless.""

The Massachusetts Democrat who sits on the Senate Banking Housing and Urban Affairs Committee said the rate of Wells Fargo customers who reported fraud or scams on Zelle was more than twice as high as other big banks and 2.5 times higher in 2022 than in 2019 among Wells Fargo customers. She said the bank ""attempted to mislead me"" by providing limited data from 2018 and 2021.

""Your responses to the remainder of my questions were insulting and useless to your customers who have been the victims of fraud and scams on Zelle and are unaware of the higher risks they face on the platform as customers of your bank"" she wrote in a letter sent Monday to Scharf.

Warren pressed the bank and Early Warning Services the parent company of money transfer platform Zelle to release more data on fraud and scam complaints reported by banking customers. Requests for comment from Wells Fargo and Early Warning Services weren't immediately returned.

She said prior requests for specific data compiled for an October analysis of fraud and scam complaints by consumers went unheeded.

""I am disappointed by your evasive and misleading reply to my October 6 2022 letter asking about the extraordinarily high and rapidly increasing instances of fraud and scams affecting Wells Fargo customers on the Zelle money transfer platform"" Warren wrote. ""Your customers – who have in recent years endured dozens of examples of lawbreaking and mistreatment by your bank – deserve better.""

Warren's report said several big banks including Wells Fargo may have violated federal law by failing to refund a vast majority of customers defrauded on Zelle. She found that the seven banks that own Zelle and its parent company — Bank of America Truist Capital One JPMorgan Chase PNC Bank U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo — did not repay customers most of the time in 190000 cases in 2021 and the first half of 2022 where consumers said they were scammed on Zelle.

The amount of the fraudulent payments reached $213 million according to the report.

Wells Fargo was among several banks that refused to release key fraud information Warren said though the frequency of Zelle fraud and scam reports by the bank's customers was ""more than twice as high as it was for comparable banks for which we had data"" according to the letter.

Jim Seitz a spokesman for Wells Fargo told CNBC in October that Warren's analysis is ""misleading and inaccurate.""

""We welcome the opportunity to have a constructive discussion about wholistic Zelle data and industry trends — not just that of 3 banks"" Seitz said.

Early Warning Services also defended Wells Fargo in its response to the results of Warren's Oct. 3 report saying that ""recent statements regarding Wells Fargo's fraud and scam rates are inaccurate. Wells Fargo's rates of reported fraud and scams are extraordinarily low and comparable to the Zelle Network as a whole where rates of reported fraud and scams represent less than 0.1% of all transactions"" according to the letter.

The company also told CNBC in October that ""any external analysis done is incomplete and does not reflect the efforts and data reported by more than 1700 financial institutions on the Zelle Network.""

The senator called Early Warning Services' response ""inaccurate"" and said it is ""not consistent with the data provided to me by Wells Fargo and other banks that are part of the Zelle network"" according to the letter.

Warren also said the reply she received from Wells Fargo was ""wholly inadequate given the scope of the problems.""

""For example you stated that data we published on Zelle-related problems at Wells Fargo and other banks contained 'apples-to-oranges comparisons' because Wells Fargo's 'response to your data request included gross claims [and] … [o]ther responses may have used different dimensions'"" Warren wrote. ""But this assertion which is an attempt to minimize the impact of the problem at Wells Fargo is false.""

Warren asked the bank for up-to-date information on the extent of fraud scams reported by customers reimbursement rates and the dollar value of reimbursements to scammed customers she says for the fifth time. The updated data will cover 2017 to 2021 and this January through September.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbmtyYXRlLmNvbS9maW5hbmNlL2NyZWRpdC1jYXJkcy9uZXctd2VsbHMtZmFyZ28tYXV0b2dyYXBoLWNhcmQtbGF1bmNoZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Wells Fargo Autograph Card Launches,"Advertiser Disclosure

Despite some strong performances from trading desks core IB (advisory and underwriting) revenues have taken sharp downturns in Europe America and APAC.

Job cuts have resulted from these downturns. Credit Suisse has been the one on everyone’s mind. The bank is aiming to cut 9000 jobs – in everything from FX trading to parts of its wealth management team.

Credit Suisse isn’t the only one however - Deutsche have done some trimming as well as Goldman Sachs. But where is the guillotine going to fall next?

Tricumen might give an indication. The London-based firm acts as a consultant to a variety of firms in the financial services industry but is best known for its spider charts breaking down operating revenue per employee per division per bank.

Although the charts show how banks performed proportionally to each other they do not show the extent to which average revenue per head has fallen since 2021.

Anything outside the dotted line on the charts is better than average. The closer to the middle of the chart the worse the performance relative to the mean.

Investment Banking - Operating revenue per employee 9M2022

Across M&A ECM and DCM American bankers were the most productive with Wells Fargo JPMorgan Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs far outperforming the global average.

By comparison European bankers had some of the worst IB productivity with Deutsche Bank HSBC and SocGen some of the least productive bankers along with UBS and Credit Suisse.

Generating low revenues per head looks dangerous in this market. Most banks have suffered significant drops in their investment banking revenues this year. On a per-head basis Tricumen says the biggest drop in revenues across the industry this year was in equity capital markets (ECM) where they fell a colossal 80% versus 2021. By comparison the industry-wide drop in revenues per head was just 10% in M&A.

If you're at a bank where revenues per head are already low and then they fall further you will be particularly exposed.

FICC - Operating revenue per employee 9M2022

Fixed income traders have had a better year but here too some are far more productive than others.

In terms of revenue per head fixed income traders performed strongest at Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs as well as JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley; Barclays and Citi traders performed averagely.

Fixed income traders at Credit Suisse as well as HSBC and BNP Paribas performed poorest with revenues per head significantly below average. Traders at Royal Bank of Canada and SocGen also generated comparatively low revenues per head. If Credit Suisse is trimming traders why not these banks too?

Across the industry as a whole Tricumen said revenues per head were more or less flat in the first nine months this year in FX Rates and Credit traders (moving 9% down 6% down and 10% up respectively). Commodities traders are set for a bumper year; their revenue per head was up nearly 40% on 2021 over the same period. FICC as a sector saw a 13% increase in revenue per employee.

Equities - Operating revenue per employee 9M2022

Equities provided a mixed bag of results for banks with traders in America once again generating strong revenue per person – traders at Goldman JPMorgan Morgan Stanley and BofA performed the strongest.

However equities traders at HSBC RBC and Credit Suisse equity traders all generated comparatively feeble revenues per capita as did Wells Fargo.

Equities trading had a more stable nine months compared to other banking sectors. Across equities sales and trading as a whole revenues per head were down only down 3.5%. They fell 17% for cash equities trading and 5% for derivatives trading. Prime services revenues per head were up 13%.

ProMedica has agreed to surrender its 15% interest in the SNF assets involved in their existing 85/15 joint venture with the real estate investment trust (REIT) and will provide “significant working capital support” to ensure the new operators have a smooth transition of patient care and operations Welltower noted.

This comes just a few months after ProMedica reported a $105 million operating loss in its senior care division for the second financial quarter of 2022 in a report using unaudited results of operations and its financial position ending June 30.

ProMedica will no longer be under its lease obligation with Welltower with these terms in place. The company acquired HCR ManorCare in 2018 rebranding the network of long-term care facilities to become ProMedica Senior Care.

The agreement does not include ProMedica’s non-Welltower leased senior care centers located in Adrian and Monroe Mich. the skilled nursing and memory care facilities located on the ProMedica Flower Hospital campus in Sylvania Ohio and ProMedica’s home health and hospice the company said in a statement issued Monday.

More specifically ProMedica will continue to operate 10 skilled nursing facilities that are not part of the Welltower transaction.

ProMedica will continue operating those centers and agencies as well as its 58 Arden Courts memory care communities within its real estate joint venture with Welltower.

This “complex” transaction will allow the not-for-profit health and well-being organization to focus more closely and put resources toward other parts of the health system according to ProMedica President and CEO Arturo Polizzi.

Polizzi took the helm as CEO last week after Randy Oostra announced his retirement.

“By engaging in this transaction we will be able to increase focus and resources on the other areas of our health system as we continue to provide high-quality compassionate care and invest in our communities and dedicated caregivers” Polizzi said in a statement.

Integra Health will enter into an 85/15 joint venture with Welltower which will include a master lease agreement that results in a combined cash rent increase of more than 4% to Welltower relative to the total current contractual rent from the existing ProMedica JV.

Welltower CEO and CIO Shankh Mitra said in a statement that while the ProMedica SNFs saw a “strong rebound in occupancy” in the last six months agency labor has continued to plague the operator. In its 2Q 2022 earnings call Mitra said ProMedica had “significantly narrowed their operating losses” and that it had nearly halved use of agency labor.

“We are excited to announce this partnership with Integra as Integra’s focused asset management and vast network of strong regional providers will allow the new joint venture to build on ProMedica’s positive performance momentum invest in the communities and hire talent” Mitra said.

The JV is expected to close before the end of 2022 and does not contain any financing contingencies.

“These communities are in extraordinary locations and comprise an important segment of the health care continuum. We aim to bring them back to their previous glory through focused asset management and a regional operator strategy with a primary focus on quality of care” Integra Health CEO David Gefner said in a statement. “We believe there is significant value to be created here for all stakeholders most importantly the facility residents and staff. We could not be more excited about what lies ahead.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53dG9sLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvcHJvbWVkaWNhLXRvLWV4aXQtc2tpbGxlZC1udXJzaW5nLXZlbnR1cmUtd2l0aC13ZWxsdG93ZXItZGVjLTE5LzUxMi1hZGIyMDJjYy0xNjc5LTQ4NDItODMzYi0zMDcwNTU1OTA5YjLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ProMedica to exit skilled nursing venture with Welltower Dec. 19 | wtol.com,"The healthcare company is transferring the real estate and management of its skilled nursing facilities to Toledo-based Welltower effective Dec. 19.

TOLEDO Ohio — ProMedica announced Monday it will transfer the real estate and management of all of its skilled nursing facilities beginning Dec. 19. The real estate will be transferred to Toledo-based Welltower.

The real estate and management of the facilities are currently handled in a joint venture by ProMedica and Welltower a Toledo-based real estate investment trust that invests in healthcare infrastructure.

A new Welltower venture with Louisiana-based Integra Health will own the facilities' real estate according to a Welltower business update. Welltower will retain the 85% of skilled nursing assets in the venture it had with ProMedica. The 15% ProMedica owned will be transitioned to Integra under the new joint venture with Welltower.

Management for the facilities will also transfer to new regional operators which will be selected by Integra the update states.

ProMedica's exit from the skilled nursing venture will resolve ""ongoing operating losses within its Senior Care Division"" ProMedica said in a press release.

Arturo Polizzi ProMedica's president and CEO said the transaction allows the Toledo-based healthcare giant to ""increase focus and resources on the other areas of our health system.""

The transaction does not include ProMedica’s senior care centers located in Adrian and Monroe Michigan the skilled nursing and memory care facilities located on the ProMedica Flower Hospital campus in Sylvania and ProMedica’s Home Health and Hospice agencies.

On Oct. 31 ProMedica's previous CEO since 2009 Randy Oostra retired. Oostra stepped down from his position as ProMedica's president in May while retaining his position as CEO. Both positions were taken over by Polizzi.

ProMedica announced its exit from the skilled nursing joint venture with Welltower on the tail end of a year full of financial woes executive and non-clinical layoffs and a lawsuit threatened by Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost.

Earlier this year the health system reported a $126 million first quarter loss and an additional $155 million loss in the second quarter. In 2021 ProMedica reported a loss of $136.3 million in operating income.

Also in 2022 multiple top executives were let go including Chief Financial Officer Steve Kavanaugh.

In July ProMedica laid off an unspecified number of non-clinical staff. It was later revealed about 150 people lost their jobs.

Last month ProMedica agreed to pay the University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences $7.6 million to make up for two outstanding monthly payments related to the company's affiliation agreement with the medical school. This was shortly after Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost threatened to sue ProMedica after it initially said it would not make the payments.

This offers an opportunity for Korean companies to rise in the global CMO and CDMO sectors.Chinese companies such as WuXi Biologics have grown rapidly as CDOs after initially entering the contract manufacturing market.He said it is too early for Samsung Biologics to seriously enter the cell and gene therapy market as a CDMO.“The current condition for the global cell and gene therapy market is similar to the situation for antibody drugs 20 years ago” he said. “We judge that it's still too early for us to enter the market.”Rather the executive said Samsung is interested in expanding its facilities for antibody drugs including one for treating Alzheimer’s disease.Samsung which recently opened its fourth CDMO factory – the world’s largest on a single site – plans to build a fifth plant in Songdo Incheon west of Seoul.The new plant will house manufacturing facilities for antibody-based biopharmaceutical products including antibody drug conjugates (ADCs).In July Samsung said it will double its manufacturing capacity by building four additional plants worth 7 trillion won ($5.3 billion) to become the world’s leader in both the CMO and CDO businesses.Samsung has been ramping up its facilities to meet growing demand from its clients.Most biopharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer Moderna AstraZeneca and Janssen Johnson & Johnson’s pharmaceutical division focus only on R&D. Without their own production facilities they outsource production to contract drugmakers.Korea is home to the world’s leading contract drug manufacturers including Samsung Biologics.Jae-young Han at jyhan@hankyung.com In-Soo Nam edited this article.",,,,,,,,,,,,

During the 2022 SEMA Show the company debuted the WD-40 Precision Pen which contains the same multi-use formula but in a compact size. The new product is expected to be released in early 2023.

“This is an innovation on our Original WD-40 Formula” said Dan Anderson director of innovation at WD-40 Company. “What makes it unique is that it allows for a lot of control and precision wherever you need the product.”

“We’re proud to equip technicians and builders with what they need to get the job done right and take things to the next level” added Greg Kershaw director of brand engagement and experience at WD-40 Company.

The company said the product is a result of feedback from end users and reflects the same spirit of perseverance innovation and tenacity for solving tough challenges that led the brand to introduce the original formula nearly 70 years ago.

“There’s a good amount of product in there and it’s great for all the things that the Original WD-40 Formula is known for such as getting squeaks out lubricating moving parts protecting against rust and corrosion loosening rust and displacing moisture” said Anderson.

He said the pen is easy to use and store ideal for tight spaces and small projects.

“The compact size is meant for times when technicians want to get the product exactly in a certain area” he explained. “This is great because you only get the formula where you need it and the amount you need.”

Another benefit is the pen’s portability. Due to its small size Anderson said it can be stored in a toolbox glove compartment pocket and/or toolbelt.

The new product will be available in all the same places WD-40 Brand products are sold.

During the SEMA Show WD-40 Brand gave away 2000 limited-edition prototypes of the WD-40 Precision Pen with seven-time Pro-4 champion Kyle LeDuc’s signature and a photo of his custom race truck. Those who received a pen with a golden cap were given a special edition Carhartt hat featuring LeDuc.

The WD-40 Brand team said they were thrilled to showcase their partnership with LeDuc at this year’s SEMA Show. “Partnerships with pros like LeDuc and others in the motorsport and bike world exemplify the brand's longstanding mission of helping pros take things to the next level” the company said.

LeDuc’s custom-built 4-wheel drive 900-horsepower race truck was displayed at the WD-40 Brand booth. It featured a new look for the SEMA Show that included a custom chrome livery.

SEMA Show attendees also had the opportunity to view the WD-40 Specialist line which includes lubricants penetrants greases contact cleaners and degreasers and rust-management solutions.

“The Original WD-40 Formula does most everything” said Anderson. “However when you have serious problems and need a specific solution we have the WD-40 Specialist line.”

This includes a Silicone option for surfaces such as rubber plastic and vinyl White Lithium Grease for metal-to-metal applications and Contact Cleaner for electric parts. “Especially with the rise of electric vehicles there are a lot more uses for that” said Anderson.

In total WD-40 Brand offers more than 30 products and each is designed to solve a specific problem.

Many of the new products are shared with WD-40 Company’s PRO Board for evaluation. “When we need feedback on something we can reach out to them” said Anderson. “We’ll send them samples and they will try things out and provide feedback.”

But as it turns out the Japanese government is very serious about the project and it plans to allocate some ¥350 billion (nearly $2.38 billion) to build the joint research hub with the U.S.

The research hub will be comprised of Japanese and American semiconductor companies that are yet to be named as well as multiple universities from Japan the U.S. and Europe reports Nikkei. Among the Japanese universities the business publication names the University of Tokyo the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology and Riken. IBM is also said to be among the candidates to participate.

The hub will conduct fundamental research to explore materials needed to make chips using a 2nm-class fabrication technology by the latter half of the decade. But it's is unclear whether Japan has plans to build actual fabs that will make commercial chips. And if such plans exist it is unclear which of the Japanese companies have enough money and scale to make chips on a leading-edge node.

It has been quite a while when Japanese companies were leaders of the microelectronics market. Today only Kioxia produces leading-edge memory in Japan. Other Japanese chip developers either use trailing nodes to make their products domestically or outsource their production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC).

But the Japanese government wants to revive the country's semiconductor industry which is why it approved subsidies for Kioxia and Western Digital Micron and TSMC to build new fabs in the country.

In addition to spending ¥350 billion ($2.38 billion) on the new research hub the Japanese government also intends to spend ¥450 billion ($3.071 billion) on advanced production hubs as well as ¥370 billion ($2.525 billion) on securing materials required for manufacturing which emphasizes how serious the authorities in Japan are about the chip industry.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9zY2Uub3JnL3NlY3JldGFyaWF0LzUzMDU2M9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Seizing the transformative power of digital and social economy: the OSCE Regional Ideathon | OSCE,"On 4 and 5 November 2022 on the Ohrid Lake North Macedonia the Regional Ideathon organized jointly by the Office of the Coordinator of OSCE Economic and Environmental Activities and the OSCE Mission to Skopje gathered seventy young people aged 18-25 from the Western Balkans’ region. Under the motto “Inspire Connect Enable” the Ideathon is a creative problem solving exercise where youth come together and guided by innovative start-uppers dive into a social or an environmental challenge and consider possible solutions with the use of technology.

The Ideathon is one of the key activities of the OSCE YDEAS project that promotes reconciliation and cooperation at regional level by leveraging innovation and digitalization for and a more inclusive fair energy-efficient and environmentally mindful economic post-pandemic recovery in the Western Balkans.

“Be the best version of yourselves” was the encouragement of the OSCE Special Representative on Youth and Security Maria Raczyńska. “We need the creativity and vision of young people to rebuild peace and security for everyone” she added in her opening address.

Aneta Pasheva Chairperson of the Economic Chamber of Information and Communication Technologies in Skopje recalled the challenges she faced as a woman and a computer scientist and discussed her first steps in the IT business sector. “No one could believe that I was the CEO of my company. Follow your passion and your dream” she said. “But do not forget that your community needs your talent. Today 90 per cent of the IT companies in North Macedonia work for foreign companies in outsourcing. In the aftermath of the endorsement of the Western Balkans’ Common Regional Market Action Plan youth’s skills are essential to transform the economic outlook of the region.”

Thanks to the financial support of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation the 2022 OSCE Polish Chairmanship as well as the South-Eastern Europe Cooperative Initiative (SECI) the YDEAS project offers the ideal platform for policy-relevant dialogue on digital and social economy and a valuable contribution towards inspiring a new generation of green and social start-uppers.

“We want to trigger a digital revolution that is fair socially and environmentally mindful. And we want the project to act as catalyst of cooperation with local authorities universities the private sector and regional organizations such as the Regional Youth Cooperation Office and the Regional Cooperation Council” said Teresa Albano OCEEA Economic Affairs Officer and the YDEAS project manager. “In times of persistent inequalities the YDEAS project intends to seize the transformative power of digital and social economy to build forward better after the COVID-19 pandemic.”

As the largest regional security organization the OSCE is aware of the importance of reconciliation and multi-stakeholders’ engagement to ensure fair post-pandemic recovery security and stability in the OSCE area. The YDEAS project is a key initiative in the long-term engagement of the Office of the Co-ordinator of OSCE Economic and Environmental Activities to this end."

In the 19th century major cities faced their own emissions problem: horse manure.

With horse-drawn carriages clogging major thoroughfares cities were burdened with noxious smelly manure that drew flies and spread disease.

The issue started to resolve itself as internal combustion engine cars grew in popularity at the beginning of the 20th century. Of course that meant horses slowly but inexorably were replaced by vehicles emitting greenhouse gases.

Now as battery electric vehicles or B.E.V.s — marketed as a more environmentally friendly vehicular option — replace internal combustion engines some skeptics are pointing out that they actually have a larger carbon footprint than nonelectric vehicles. That’s due to the manufacturing and disposal of B.E.V.s — specifically their batteries — as well as a reliance on coal to create the electricity that powers them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vbmVvLXRyYW5zLmJsb2cvMjAyMi8xMS8wNy9tZWRpY2FsLW11dHVhbC1ocS1zdGFmZi13b250LXJldHVybi1kb3dudG93bi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Medical Mutual HQ staff won't return downtown,"Medical Mutual’s 10-story 120-year-old Rose Building in downtown Cleveland has been mostly empty since the pandemic as many of the insurance company’s employees are working from home. They will not return to work in this building in 2023 and will instead report to work at the company’s operations center in suburban Brooklyn on a hybrid work basis (Google).

HQ leaving for Brooklyn; Rose Building may go residential

A spokesperson for health insurance industry giant Medical Mutual confirmed that the company’s headquarters will leave downtown Cleveland in 2023. However most of their roughly 1000 downtown office employees never returned from remote-working during the pandemic leaving the historic Rose Building at East 9th Street and Prospect Avenue mostly empty over the past two-plus years. Today’s news has led to some wondering if the building could be converted to residential as with other old office buildings downtown.

“Like many other companies we now have the majority of our staff on a hybrid schedule or working from home” said Sue Walton manager of corporate communications at Medical Mutual in an e-mail to NEOtrans. “We have very few full-time employees currently working in the Rose Building. As a mutual company we have to weigh the economic feasibility of maintaining multiple underutilized sites in Northeast Ohio with the responsibility we have toward our members who are a top priority.”

She said employees will begin moving to its Brooklyn offices in a phased approach throughout the year beginning in January 2023. In 2017 Medical Mutual acquired the 381000-square-foot Rose Building for $37.9 million where its corporate office had been located since 1947. That same year it also consolidated several suburban offices into the former American Greetings headquarters in Brooklyn. The latter involved leasing a newly renovated four-story 324000-square-foot office building which is part of an adjoining 1-million-square-foot multitenant commercial structure that was also renovated. Medical Mutual is the oldest and largest health insurance company based in Cleveland.

City officials said they were caught off guard by Medical Mutual’s decision having learned about the announced move only today. The insurance company was prepared to make $12 million worth of renovations to the Rose Building in 2020 but then the pandemic hit. That renovation was to be supported by a $1 million 20-year loan from the city that was deferred for 10 years when some or all of the loan may be forgiven based on the job creation within the city.

Front entrance to Medical Mutual’s operations center in the Cleveland suburb of Brooklyn which is where the company’s staff who aren’t working from home will be based. This building was the former corporate headquarters of American Greetings before the gift card maker moved out to Westlake (jljiinc.com).

“I’m very disappointed in this decision by Medical Mutual and I hope they reconsider” said Ward 3 Councilman Kerry McCormack whose ward includes downtown in a text to NEOtrans. “The city of Cleveland has been nothing but a great partner to Medical Mutual even passing incentives for their downtown building a few years ago. The city is also a large customer of Medical Mutual through our insurance plan. It’s hard to take the statement seriously about the company ‘remaining committed to Cleveland’ when they abandon the city. Cutting a check to philanthropy doesn’t cut it. I wish they would have followed the example of companies like Sherwin Williams and remain committed to Cleveland.”

According to industry insiders the 120-year-old Rose Building no longer served the company’s needs especially in the post-pandemic era. The building has outdated air filtration systems narrow corridors and traditional closed office spaces which made it difficult for office sharing in a hybrid work environment. Also starting next year Medical Mutual employees working early in the day or late into the evening would have been competing for spaces in a 540-space parking deck that will be shared by the new 23-story City Club Apartments 776 Euclid Ave.

Construction of the 304-unit apartment tower could be afforded because a new parking deck didn’t need to be built for it. Instead City Club Apartments residents would use the existing parking deck at night while workers at neighboring companies like Medical Mutual would continue to use it during the day. But not all Medical Mutual employees arrive or leave the office before City Club residents’ cars will out of the parking deck. And many City Club residents will also work downtown including in their own apartments while keeping a car all day at the parking garage.

In addition to Medical Mutual’s offices in downtown Cleveland the company has nine other locations in northern Ohio all of which in suburban offices. McCormack said he intends to make the case to Medical Mutual that leaving downtown may hurt the company’s ability to recruit young talent who want to work in a walkable urban setting. That he said is reason enough for it to retain a significant presence downtown.

The Rose Building was Ohio’s largest office building when it opened in 1902 in a part of Cleveland that was not yet considered the city’s central business district. Indeed a stone townhouse stands next to the Rose Building’s wrought-iron façade on its East 9th Street side then called Erie Street (Wiki).

“Not only is it the right thing to do it’s critical for competitive recruitment for their company” he said. “Decisions like this also increase sprawl and contribute to the regional problem of connecting workers to work places.”

Over the past decade 7 million square feet of leasable office space has been removed from downtown’s inventory by conversions of obsolete office buildings to other uses primarily residential. McCormack said it was too soon to consider alternatives to retaining Medical Mutual’s offices downtown. Walton also said it was too soon to consider how the Rose Building might be used in the future or who might own it.

“We are exploring all options for the Rose Building” she said.

The structure was Ohio’s largest office building when it was built in 1902 by businessman and philanthropist Benjamin Rose. It was built so far out from the city’s central business district at that time that it was called Rose’s Folly. The 10-story building was designed by George Horatio Smith who also contributed to the design of The Arcade linking Euclid and Superior avenues and the Colonial Arcade now the Fifth Street Arcades between Euclid and Prospect avenues.

Twitter used to be fun. Now it's just draining. After Elon Musk's $44 billion takeover of Twitter was finalized Oct. 27 2022 the ubiquitous social media platform which has been around for more than a decade has been in chaos. Advertisers are bailing and so are users.

Maybe you've decided to delete your account too. Deleting a Twitter account is easy; it's coming to that decision that takes some real thought.

Whilst a global pandemic is never well timed the timing was particularity unfortunate for GATS as Covid-19 materialised soon after its launch which resulted in a collapse in aircraft trading and a loss of momentum. Consequently as focus during the pandemic shifted away from aircraft trading it also necessarily shifted away from GATS. With fewer transactions in the market leasing companies found themselves competing harder than ever for airline business. GATS became a secondary priority.

With aircraft trading and operating lease transactions post Covid-19 having returned to the market in significant numbers now is the perfect time for industry participants to revisit GATS. In this article we review GATS from the airline’s perspective why airlines would save money and resources by leasing their aircraft in a GATS structure and how GATS protects the rights and interests of the airlines.

The GATS Structure

The structure of a GATS transaction is based on a legal owner/beneficial owner structure which has been used in many aircraft leasing transactions in many jurisdictions and over many years and is therefore tried tested and established. Even outside GATS trading aircraft using owner trusts is simplified. GATS builds on and ‘turbo-charges’ the owner trust structure using the beneficial interest transfer as a foundation for making transfers even more efficient by (1) using standard form documentation for the GATS trust instrument and transfer instrument; (2) requiring all such documents to be executed electronically on the GATS platform; a (3) recording all beneficial interest transfers on the (searchable) GATS ledger; and (4) providing for (optional) additional provisions to be inserted into the transfer clause of the lease to allow for a more streamlined trade of the aircraft without compromising and indeed enhancing the rights of the airline as explained above. The following diagrams show the difference between a standard non-GATS structure and a GATS structure:

In a GATS transaction bare legal title to the aircraft is held in a trust by a professional trustee (which has been approved to act as a GATS trustee) with all of the beneficial and economic interest in the aircraft being held by the lessor entity who but for the owner trust structure (as depicted on the left) who would typically have been the lessor and would have held both legal and beneficial title to the aircraft. The arrangement between the GATS trustee as legal owner and the leasing company as GATS beneficiary is established pursuant to the GATS trust instrument which is standard form and is executed electronically through the GATS platform. Notwithstanding the interposing of the GATS trustee as the lessor the airline will continue to deal with the leasing company as it would in a standard transaction. Generally speaking the GATS trustee cannot exercise lessor rights or discretions under the lease without the consent of the leasing company and similarly the GATS trustee will exercise such rights at the direction of the leasing company.

The HIPAA Privacy Rule requires that covered entities that create receive maintain and/or transmit PHI take specific measures to protect that information and only share it with third parties under specific circumstances. These entities are now facing significant regulatory and legal consequences.

Markup analyzed the websites of 100 of the top hospitals in the United States and found that a number of the websites contained a tracker (or web beacon) called Meta Pixel. Web beacons are 1-pixel by 1-pixel graphic images placed on a website to measure the effectiveness of online advertising and user interactions with that website.1 Meta Pixel like other trackers can measure and collect information about certain actions taken by a visitor. Meta Pixel is unique in that the information is shared with Meta (f/k/a Facebook) and can be linked with Meta and Instagram profiles to generate highly targeted ads. In response to the Markup report several healthcare entities removed Meta Pixel and other trackers from their websites and patient portals. The steps taken by these entities are important but the damage may already be done.

According to several recently filed class action lawsuits it is alleged that Meta Pixel impermissibly collected and received PHI including IP addresses patient search terms appointment information medications and physician names without the patient’s consent. Notably it is alleged that Meta Pixel captured information within the password protected patient portals as well as on the main website accessible to the public.

Meta Pixel has been cited as the basis for data breach notifications impacting nearly 5 million patients and prompted the filing of at least nine (9) class action lawsuits.2 The class action lawsuits allege violations of various state and federal privacy laws including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act; the Pennsylvania Wiretap Act; the federal Wiretap Act; the California Invasion of Privacy Act; and Illinois Personal Information Protection Act. Further the suits allege that the healthcare entities who utilized Meta Pixel on their websites failed to receive express consent from the impacted individuals and failed to have valid contracts in place (business associate agreements) that would permit the sharing of PHI under HIPAA.

In addition to being named as a defendant in the class action lawsuits and facing potential regulatory actions Meta has also received an inquiry from Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) expressing his concern about Meta Pixel and the sensitive protected information it may collect.3

The privacy issues surrounding web beacons and Meta Pixel are not limited to healthcare entities and HIPAA. Bloomberg Law reports that since February 2022 over 45 proposed class actions have been filed alleging that Meta Pixel tracked individual’s personal video consumption data in violation of the federal Video Privacy Protection Act (“VPPA”).4 Enacted in 1988 the VPPA requires that video tape service providers obtain informed and written consent before disclosing an individual’s video viewing information to a third party. The VPPA provides for a private right of action which permits an individual to bring a civil action seeking damages including statutory damages of not less than $2500 per individual.5

It is too early to speculate what the ultimate fallout of the Meta Pixel litigation and regulatory actions will be. However it’s worth noting that a similar class action lawsuit involving a healthcare entity’s usage of third-party analytics tools cookies and tracking pixels recently resulted in a $18 million settlement.6

Insurance implications

The facts surrounding the use of trackers will have a significant impact on the availability of coverage. A web beacon or pixel that discloses PHI / PII to a third-party absent users’ consent or a valid contract as long as that compromise is considered a data breach or privacy incident may implicate coverage for data incident responses expenses. Data incident response expenses include coverage for breach counsel to advise as to whether an incident triggers statutory or regulatory obligations to notify affected individuals or regulators. If it is determined that notification is warranted then further data incident response coverages including notification and public relation expenses may also be triggered.

Additionally any subsequent litigation or regulatory action that arises from the data breach notification may trigger coverage under a policy’s third-party privacy liability and regulatory proceeding insuring agreements.

Alternatively allegations that PHI / PII was disclosed or shared in violation of an entity’s privacy policy may be sufficient to constitute a privacy liability wrongful act even in the absence of a suspected data breach.

What should you do

We recommend that clients review their website’s configuration and identify any trackers / web beacons / pixels. Clients should confirm that any data being collected is done in compliance with applicable data privacy laws and with the knowledge and consent of the user. Any data that is collected used or disclosed should be limited to the minimum information necessary to accomplish its purpose and not be used or disclosed beyond what is legally permissible. Clients should review their contracts with any third-party vendors or business associates to ensure that reasonable measures are taken to secure any data that is collected transmitted or stored on their behalf.

Lastly clients are advised to work with their broker to review their cyber insurance policy and discuss potential coverage options including regulatory fines and penalties coverage and wrongful collection coverage.

Harrow and Nottingham University-educated Oliver Scarr has been appointed to the role which will be based in Singapore.

Scarr who has spent most of his working life with the former Willis Towers Watson will report to Lewis Hart head of marine Asia at WTW.

Scarr will lead WTW’s cargo business in Asia and is responsible for the “delivery of WTW’s cargo value proposition into the Asian market”.

His role involves the development of a strategy to grow the cargo business as well as the overall coordination of cargo placement and broking activities into Asia.

He will also have oversight of product development to meet the “evolving needs of those operating within the complex world of international trade” WTW said.

Hart said: “Oliver is a great example of an exceptional young talent at WTW and we are excited to welcome him back to Asia in this newly created role as head of cargo.

“Cargo is a key focus area for our marine business which we will continue to invest in throughout the region over the coming year as we build on our talented team.”

Before relocating to Singapore Scarr worked in WTW’s cargo business in London within the firm’s global marine line of business.

His focus was on the provision of risk and insurance solutions to companies shipping goods around the globe including commodity traders manufacturers energy producers and shippers of all types of cargo.

Scarr joined WTW’s graduate programme in 2014 working within the international cargo team focusing on the placement and servicing of business emanating from Asia the Middle East and Africa.

Two years later he was seconded to Singapore taking on responsibility for broking cargo risks into the regional Asian markets.

He subsequently relocated to Hong Kong where he continued in this role providing a link between the regional Asian and London insurance markets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3Mvb3Blbi1lbnJvbGxtZW50LWlycy1jaGFuZ2VzLWZzYS1oc2EtZmxleGlibGUtc3BlbmRpbmctYWNjb3VudC1oZWFsdGgtc2F2aW5ncy1hY2NvdW50LTIwMjMv0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL25ld3Mvb3Blbi1lbnJvbGxtZW50LWlycy1jaGFuZ2VzLWZzYS1oc2EtZmxleGlibGUtc3BlbmRpbmctYWNjb3VudC1oZWFsdGgtc2F2aW5ncy1hY2NvdW50LTIwMjMv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The IRS is making big changes to FSAs and HSAs. Here's what to know.,"Employers typically offer a period of open enrollment in the fall when their workers are allowed to pick new health plans enroll in a Flexible Spending Account or make other changes to their benefits. This year there are some changes ahead that could help employees while also potentially opening up some financial pitfalls.

Among the biggest changes for 2023 concern two tax-advantaged health savings accounts: Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) and Health Savings Accounts (HSA). These accounts can save workers a nice chunk of change by allowing them to sock away pre-tax money to pay for medical expenses. Basically you save what you would have paid in taxes on money you put in the accounts.

In 2023 employees can put away as much as $3050 in an FSA an increase of about 7% from the current tax year's cap of $2850. Meanwhile single workers who want to fund an HSA can save up to $3850 next year a 5.5% increase from 2022 while families can save up to $7750 up 6.2%.

Those increases are helpful at a time when inflation is at it highest in four decades with consumer prices having jumped more than 8% from a year ago. But there are several ""gotchas"" that workers need to be aware of especially when it comes to Flexible Spending Accounts with the foremost being that FSAs are ""use-it-or-lose-it"" programs. In other words if you don't use all the money you set aside you'll lose it — your employer keeps any unused funds.

""Open enrollment typically opens in late October and early November"" said Lisa Myers director of client services benefits accounts at Willis Towers Watson. ""Planning carefully is important and knowing the deadlines.""

Indeed U.S. workers end up forfeiting a total of about $3 billion a year in unused FSA funds according to an analysis from Money.

Here's what to consider during open enrollment.

What's the difference between an FSA and HSA?

Both accounts are aimed at helping workers pay for medical expenses with pre-tax money. The biggest difference is that FSAs are controlled by your employer while HSAs are owned by the individual.

That means that if you leave your job your FSA won't move with you. But once you open and fund an HSA that account does stay with you like your 401(k) which continues to be yours even after you leave a job and start at a new employer.

Another big difference: Health Savings Accounts are designed for people with high-deductible health care plans. This means that not every employee will have access to an HSA.

HSAs generally have more flexibility than FSAs. For instance unused funds roll over each year unlike with a FSA where funds are forfeited if not used by your employer's claim deadline. And you can change your contributions to your HSA at any time; with a FSA contributions are set during open enrollment.

""Funds go into this account on a pre-tax basis they can grow over time including be invested and as long as they're eventually used on medical expenses is also tax free"" Stephen Durso associate director of benefit accounts at Willis Towers Watson told CBS News.

""So that kind of triple-tax savings benefit is really unmatched based on the available types of accounts. If you have an HSA available it really is an attractive option for you"" he added.

Can I enroll in both an FSA and HSA?

Generally no noted Myers of Willis Towers Watson. However people with HSAs can opt for a slimmed-down version of a Flexible Spending Account known as a ""limited purpose FSA."" These accounts can only be used for vision and dental expenses which shrinks their usefulness.

That means employees who qualify for both programs will generally need to decide whether it makes more sense to fund either an FSA or an HSA for 2023.

How much should I set aside for 2023?

Some employers offer tools to help workers estimate their potential annual health costs but you can also look at your out-of-pocket medical expenses for the past year to help gauge your likely expenditures for the upcoming year Myers said.

People with HSAs also may want to set aside the amount that they'll pay due to their health plan deductible since that's out-of-pocket spending that they could get reimbursed through that tax-advantaged account.

There's more at stake for people who are opting for FSAs since overestimating your medical expenses could leave money sitting in your account that eventually returns to your employer.

What deadlines should I be aware of?

You'll need to stay on top of the deadline for claiming your FSA funds.

Employers can give employees a grace period of up to two and a half months after the end of a calendar year to claim the money. But you'll have to check if your company offers extra time and mark on your calendar when you'll need to claim the money by.

Some employees may be surprised by deadlines this year because a pandemic stimulus bill and the IRS relaxed the rules for claiming FSA funds providing more time for people to file claims in 2020 and 2021. But those provisions have expired which means people with FSAs in 2022 must claim their money by year-end or by an employer's grace period in early 2023.

""That was temporary relief due to the pandemic so employees may have larger than usual balances in their health and dependent-care FSAs and that they may forfeit going into 2023"" Myers said. ""It's important to check your balances check the plan rules so they can plan their spending for the remainder of 2022.""

What can I spend my FSA money on?

Employees are sometimes surprised at what their FSA plans will cover including Band-Aids reading glasses first-aid kits and over-the-counter medicine Myers said.

She recommends that people check the FSAStore.com which carries all FSA-eligible items especially if you are getting close to your deadline for claiming your funds and need to use the money.

Myers also advises that you check your 2022 FSA balance and claim deadlines now rather than waiting until the end of the year. Generally a health service or good must be purchased in 2022 to qualify for a 2022 FSA claim so waiting until the last minute to try to spend the funds could increase your risk of running into a barrier — such as if your eye doctor is booked up which could hinder renewing your prescription to get new glasses.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2luc3VyYW5jZS1icm9rZXJhZ2UtbWFya2V0LXRvLWdyb3ctYnktdXNkLTEwMS05NC1ibi1pbmNyZWFzZWQtZGVtYW5kLWZvci1pbnN1cmFuY2UtcG9saWNpZXMtdG8tYm9vc3QtbWFya2V0LWdyb3d0aC0tLXRlY2huYXZpby0zMDE2NjgwMzcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Insurance Brokerage Market to Grow by USD 101.94 Bn Increased Demand For Insurance Policies to Boost Market ...,"NEW YORK Nov. 7 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The ""Insurance Brokerage Market by Type (Non-life insurance and Life insurance) and Geography (North America Europe APAC South America and Middle East and Africa) - Forecast and Analysis 2022-2026"" report has been added to Technavio's offering.

Reddit has emerged as an important platform for investors in the last couple of years. Leading subreddits like r/WallStreetBets r/stocks and r/investing boast 12.9 million 4.8 million and 2.1 million members respectively as of Q3 2022. Reddit has introduced thousands to the investing world and the subreddits on the social news aggregation platform are actively used to discuss investment ideas that can provide a high return on investment (ROI). Reddit played an integral role in some of the most famous short squeezes of 2021. Investors looking to manipulate the market posted information on the social media platform pushing the general public to acquire shares in the expectation of capital gains. This onslaught was driven by various objectives including making profits and the need to pressure hedge funds into covering their short bets. Retail investors started purchasing “meme-stocks” such as GameStop and AMC Entertainment due to the information shared on Reddit. As a result the stock prices skyrocketed with GameStop increasing by more than 1000% within only two weeks. Stocks such as Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) Salesforce Inc. (NYSE:CRM) and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) are among the best Reddit stocks gaining investor attention on the social media platform recently.

10. SAP SE (NYSE:SAP)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 16

SAP ranks 10th on our list of the best Reddit stocks to buy. SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is a Walldorf Germany-based software company that is a provider of enterprise software related to business operations and customer relations.

SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is on the radar of the Reddit community due to its solid fundamentals. The company was able to surpass Q3 2022 forecasts due to the strong performance of the cloud business. Toby Ogg at JPMorgan increased the price target on SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) from $115.09 to $116.09 in a note issued to investors on October 26. The target price reflects an upside of 18.75% from the closing price as of November 4.

SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is amongst the best Reddit stocks as experts view SAP SE’s (NYSE:SAP) backlog strength for cloud computing services as encouraging. Cloud migration activity has been gaining pace leading investors to believe that SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) stock offers significant upside even in an economic environment with limited growth prospects. The stock also offers an annual forward dividend yield of 2.16% as of November 4.

Polen Capital shared its outlook on SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:

“SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is Europe’s largest software company and the global leader in enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. ERP is a software category that is particularly critical to business functions and therefore has high retention rates even in times of economic stress. For the past several years SAP has been going through several transitions including moving to cloud-based SaaS (Software as a service) solutions and an initiative to better integrate its various software solutions. In recent quarters we have seen increasing evidence that both transitions are being successfully executed and the result should be a faster-growing more consistent higher margin and more advantaged business. As investment costs from these transition programs wane and as the benefits of higher growth continue we expect that earnings will grow at a double-digit rate from next year (2023) onwards. In light of this we believe the valuation is very attractive for longterm investors.”

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21

FIGS Inc. (NYSE:FIGS) is a Santa Monica California-based healthcare apparel company known for its scrubs that come in a wide range of colors and styles. These scrubs are very popular amongst healthcare professionals as evident on Reddit.

Lauren Schenk at Morgan Stanley considers FIGS Inc. (NYSE:FIGS) one of the best-positioned stocks in the small-to-mid-cap companies' category. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic the adoption of scrubs has gained pace among healthcare professionals. Some experts have compared the rise of FIGS Inc. (NYSE:FIGS) in the healthcare sector with the emergence and dominance of Crocs in the footwear segment. The healthcare sector is expected to show resilience in economic recessions making companies like FIGS Inc. (NYSE:FIGS) an attractive investment idea.

Baron Funds shared its bullish long-term outlook on FIGS Inc. (NYSE:FIGS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:

“Within our Disruptive Growth group some companies depreciated in value. New position FIGS Inc. (NYSE:FIGS) declined about 15%. The relatively new direct-to-consumer producer of health care apparel has declined along with the broader group of young high-growth publicly traded companies. Investors have continued to shun newer business models that they perceive to be riskier. The company has declined over 80% from its highs achieved in late 2021. The recent volatility created an opportunity for us to initiate and build a position in a company that we believe can continue to grow revenue above 20% annually while also expanding margins. Its superior product is competing against brands that lack investment capabilities to improve their offerings. We believe Figs could command a meaningful share of the $79 billion global health care apparel market and eventually develop products for other professions.”

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30

GWW ranks 8th on our list of the best Reddit stocks to invest in. W.W. Grainger Inc. (NYSE:GWW) is a Lake Forest Illinois-based industrial supply company.

Reddit users find the company’s online channel user-friendly and efficient. W.W. Grainger Inc. (NYSE:GWW) differentiates itself from Home Depot and other similar retailers by catering to the needs of businesses that use purchase orders instead of credit card receipts. On October 17 Stephen Volkmann at Jefferies resumed coverage on W.W. Grainger Inc. (NYSE:GWW) stock with a target price of $600 and a Buy rating. The analyst thinks that W.W. Grainger Inc.’s (NYSE:GWW) growth strategy is coming to fruition and the valuation also appears to be reasonable. Volkmann believes that the company’s scale expansion and digital strategy will help capture greater market share and aid in maintaining a healthy top line in an uncertain macroeconomic environment.

Third Avenue Management shared its stance on W.W. Grainger Inc. (NYSE:GWW) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:

“Held in the Fund since 2019 Grainger plc (“Grainger”) is a UK-based real estate operating company that is the leading owner manager and developer of multi-family properties in the supply-constrained markets of the UK (where the multi-family business is more commonly referred to as the private-rental sector or “PRS”). At the end of the 2021 calendar year the company owned a portfolio of 7100 PRS units that were 95.0% leased with two-thirds of the value in the greater London area and the remaining one-third in the other UK regions. In addition to its stabilized portfolio of “market-rate” PRS properties Grainger also owns a portfolio of approximately 2500 “rent-controlled” units dating back to its roots as a more diversified residential company (Grainger was founded in 1912). Due to the regulated nature of these properties only about 8-10% of the units can be disposed of each year. However the proceeds from these sales as well as the earnings the company retains as an operating company as opposed to a REIT are being utilized to build out its strategic development pipeline with planning for almost 8400 additional PRS units- including 3000 very well-located units through its joint venture with the Transport for London (TFL). Despite being well-capitalized with a loan-to-value ratio of approximately 30% alongside prospects to self-finance its development pipeline that is expected to increase its recurring cash flows by more than 90% through 2025 Grainger’s common stock continues to trade at a discount to its stated NAV (which is provided annually based upon third-party appraisals under International Financial Reporting Standards). This inefficiency may very well relate to Grainger’s status as an operating company not a REIT which leaves the company out of certain Real Estate indices and mandates. It is not inconceivable though that as the company further builds out its stabilized PRS portfolio it may ultimately elect REIT tax status serving to boost its annual dividend and widening its potential investor base. Should such a modification not materialize and the price- to-value gap remain there would also likely be a great deal of strategic interest in the platform given Grainger’s scale in this emerging asset class within the UK.”

7. Domino's Pizza Inc. (NYSE: DPZ )

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32

DPZ ranks 9th on our list of the best Reddit stocks to buy now. Domino’s Pizza Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) is an Ann Arbor Michigan-based globally renowned pizza restaurant chain. The company operates in 90 countries and has more than 19000 restaurants.

The Reddit community believes that the company will do well during a recession as pizza provides an affordable fast-food option during inflationary times and is a cheaper option compared to other quick-service restaurants. Andrew Strelzik at BMO Capital gave Domino’s Pizza Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) stock an Outperform rating with a target price of $400 in a research note issued on October 14. The analyst thinks that the concern in the pizza category is overblown and anticipates a favorable demand forecast for Domino’s Pizza Inc. (NYSE:DPZ).

Domino’s Pizza Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) offers an annual forward dividend yield of 1.32% as of November 4. The company’s Carryout and Delivery business are expected to provide more opportunities for growth. In Q3 2022 the company's carryout same-store sales in the US observed a rise of 19.6% compared to the same period last year. Over the past three years Domino’s Pizza Inc.’s (NYSE:DPZ) US carryout same-store sales have recorded a rise of 55%.

Online poker play may be on the verge of a comeback in Nevada

Say hello to curling the next competitive sport in Las Vegas

Wynn Las Vegas on the Strip Monday Oct. 31 2022. Tilman Fertitta has acquired 6.9 million shares in Las Vegas-based Wynn Resorts Ltd. (K.M. Cannon/Las Vegas Review-Journal) @KMCannonPhoto

Many people in the gaming industry have begun asking the same question: What is Tilman Fertitta up to buying an estimated $385 million in Wynn Resorts Ltd. stock?

Local gaming industry analyst John DeCree has a few theories ranging from it’s just a casual investment to maybe it’s the first step toward a corporate takeover. The path to taking the reins of Wynn Resorts would be difficult according to DeCree.

Fertitta is the sole owner and CEO of Fertitta Entertainment Inc. which owns the Landry’s Restaurants empire and other restaurant brands the Golden Nugget operations in multiple states including downtown Las Vegas and the NBA’s Houston Rockets. And he’s a cousin of the Red Rock Resorts-owning Frank Fertitta family.

Plans for new resort

Tilman Fertitta was in the news a week earlier when he received permission from the Clark County Commission to begin demolishing buildings on 6 acres he acquired at the southeast corner of Harmon Avenue and Las Vegas Boulevard. He submitted plans to build a 2420-room resort that would include restaurants convention space a spa wedding chapel auto showroom and a 2500-seat theater.

It would include suites and villas VIP salons and a bar and lounge for high-limit gamblers building plans indicate.

The acquisition of Wynn’s stock occurred the same day he was approved by the county on his 43-story resort. Based on buying 6.9 million shares at Oct. 27’s closing stock price the value of the purchase would be around $385 million.

Fertitta disclosed the purchase in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Oct. 31.

Neither Fertitta nor Wynn offered any comments on the stock purchase the amount of which requires him to disclose it to the Nevada Gaming Commission.

There is no regulation prohibiting Fertitta from making such a purchase but state regulations say if an individual acquires 5 percent or more of shares it must be reported to gaming regulators. Only if a transaction involves more than 10 percent of all shares would Fertitta be required to stand before regulators to be licensed for suitability a process through which Fertitta probably would have no problem winning approval.

The stock buy places Fertitta’s ownership stake in Wynn at 6.1 percent making him the second-largest investor behind Elaine Wynn who owns 8.9 percent.

But what is Fertitta doing with his shares?

Passive investment?

DeCree an analyst with CBRE Equity Research in Las Vegas said Fertitta could simply be making a passive investment in the company but that would be uncharacteristic of his history.

“While the filing signals a passive investment Fertitta’s track record would suggest otherwise” DeCree said in a report to investors published Monday. “We look to his prior acquisitions including McCormick &Schmick’s and Morton’s Restaurant Group both of which started with 13G (SEC) filings that culminated in a full takeover. Wynn is a more complicated endeavor but the take-private saga of Landry’s from 2008-10 is a good example of Fertitta’s tenacity.”

DeCree who has a $100 price target for Wynn shares said uncertainties in Macao could be part of the analysis.

Seven companies are bidding for six concessions in Macao and while it seems highly unlikely that Wynn would be left out when the government makes decisions about what companies are licensed going into 2023 stranger things have happened.

“Wynn shares have sold off 25 percent year to date due to the elusive recovery in Macao that is likely delayed indefinitely as China goes back into lockdown. The concession rebid is expected to conclude by year end 2022 but with a seventh bidder (Genting) in the mix markets are nervous that a U.S. operator could be displaced making valuation discovery challenging. Still we could make an argument that Wynn shares are trading even below fair value of the domestic enterprise which we value at $76 a share.”

While the stock of companies operating in Macao have taken a beating over the past 2 1/2 years most analysts are in agreement that the market will come back.

Macao frustrations

It has been frustrating to watch all the starts and stops of Macao as it struggles through recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.

It’s difficult for those of us in the U.S. to understand China’s zero-COVID policy that includes lockdowns in locations where an individual tests positive for the disease.

MGM Resorts International saw that happen at its MGM Cotai property last month when a dealer tested positive for COVID and every employee and visitor at the property were quarantined in the building. News outlets broadcast a video of a man trying to escape from the casino and being chased through the streets of Macao by someone wearing a hazmat suit.

Assuming Fertitta is pursuing a passive investment it could pay off handsomely if Macao rebounds to the $100 price point DeCree has targeted.

But if this is the start of a takeover effort it will be a fascinating fight for one of Las Vegas’ most storied companies.

It's no surprise that these hotels look to their spas to provide some serious wow factor. With gorgeous hammams high-tech treatments and some of the most relaxing spots on The Strip here are 10 of the best spas in Las Vegas.



Booking Tip Book your treatment at least a week in advance to ensure you can select the time and service that works best for you.

The Spa at Aria

The Spa at Aria has a selection of whirlpools steam baths and saunas in both locker rooms along with several co-ed spaces. There is a lounge filled with heated Japanese stone ganbanyoku beds a Shio salt room and a therapy pool perched on a balcony above the main pool deck. Signature services tend to focus on hydration — be it their Fiji Body Wrap or their Energy of the Glaciers Facial that uses products from Swiss skincare brand Valmont perfect for parched desert skin.

""It didn’t take long after checking into The Spa at Aria on an especially sweltering summer day in 2023 to understand how massive the facilities are"" T+L contributor Katie Chang said of her recent visit. ""I recommend the Hydrafacial a multi-tasking treatment that transforms dull complexions to plump perfection. Set aside plenty of time to take advantage of the more unique amenities such as the Shio salt room fireside lounge and ganbanyoku stone beds. Given the spa’s popularity book your treatments at least a week in advance.""

Bellagio Spa & Salon

Just off this property’s iconic and ever-changing conservatory lies one of Las Vegas’s most well-programmed spas. In addition to offering the city’s only Watsu massage (a combination of zen shiatsu and stretching done while gently floating in a private heated pool) they also boast traditional ashiatsu CBD therapies and a couple’s suite with its own pool. What’s more their salon features a private barbershop for traditional cuts and decadent shaving rituals.

And relaxation doesn't have to end when you leave the spa thanks to the hotel's Stay Well rooms. T+L contributor and Pilates studio owner Jean Chen Smith stayed in one of the recently renovated Stay Well rooms at The Bellagio on a recent trip. ""The rooms feature an air purification system that reduces pollutants and pollen which is especially nice for allergy sufferers like myself. StayWell’s memory foam mattresses help to support those with back pain and lumbar issues while Soundscape helps to induce calm with the sounds of nature as you unwind from the stress of the day. I had never tried it before but it was so effective I purchased a similar machine for my home.""



Qua Baths & Spa at Caesars Palace

While this Caesars spa features a modern Roman bath complex complete with an Arctic ice room where it actually snows it’s Qua’s unique services that truly stand out. The menu includes a Cleopatra Golden Goddess Facial featuring Natura Bisse products and a 24-karat gold Knesko mask as well as a Mojave Rain Massage. The latter starts with a sage smudging and application of nine essential oils that act as a natural Icy-Hot on the back before a total body massage commences.

T+L special projects editor Elizabeth Rhodes visited this spa for a day of recovery after seeing Adele's residency at Caesars in November 2022. ""What better way to recover from a Vegas night out than a massage and a refreshing dip in the spa's Roman baths? After a relaxing treatment followed by moments in the sauna and ice rooms my sister and I were ready for another exciting day in the city.""

Sahra Spa at The Cosmopolitan

The Cosmopolitan's menu of services is enticing with HydraFacial Intraceuticals and NuFace experiences in addition to massages. But it's the hammam that makes Sahra a destination worth visiting. For the ultimate escape you and up to three friends will want to book their popular CBD Moroccan Journey a few months out. For this treatment guests enter a private hammam and lay on a heated mother stone where they are cleansed with Moroccan mint tea silt bubbles before undergoing a dual exfoliation with a traditional kese mitt and then a CBD coffee and Himalayan salt scrub. Next a boreal forest mud mask is applied before guests enter a steam bath. Pure honey is then lacquered on before another steam followed by a whirlpool soak and the service concludes with a CBD and botanical-infused massage.

The Spa at Encore Las Vegas

Barbara Kraft

At Encore's spa the light and ethereal aesthetic sets the stage for some decadent relaxation. With multiple pools natural light and the most over-the-top path to treatment rooms this spa is a luxe place to relax on The Strip. For the ultimate indulgence book their Journey to Euphoria where two therapists complete a four-handed massage and exfoliation treatment over 105 minutes.

AWANA Spa at Resorts World

Courtesy of AWANA Spa

As the first newly built spa on The Strip in over a decade this facility is very well thought out. From its curvilinear walls to its Fountain of Youth AWANA screams zen. Here you’ll find the country’s first aufguss performance sauna where Sauna-Meisters use aromatherapy and dancing towels to move heat through choreographed movements.

Permit applications to be presented to county commissioners

ALAMOSA — Xcel Energy announced Friday in a press release that there is a proposed route for a new transmission line in Alamosa and Conejos counties.

The line according to the release will “rebuild infrastructure in the region” as well as replace an aging power line and will deliver “continued reliability and safety for Southern Colorado.”

The proposed project would be a 40-mile long 69-kilovolt line that primarily would follow Highway 285 county roads and field boundaries. The new line would replace the current 60-year-old project that needs to be replaced. The new line will reportedly meet updated system and electric equipment including the use of a fire-resistant steel. The line will improve electric service for customers in the region.

Rebuilding the line is part of Xcel’s comprehensive wildfire mitigation plan that includes reviewing upgrading and rebuilding aging infrastructure to limit the possibility of wildfires while improving the region’s infrastructure.

“Xcel Energy is committed to delivering reliable safe and affordable electricity for our customers and rebuilding projects like the Alamosa to Antonito transmission line help deliver on that promise” said Ashley Valdez area manager communities and local government affairs serving Southern Colorado in the release. “This new route proposal is the result of significant feedback provided by local community members and helps meet the needs of the San Luis Valley.”

Permit applications the release stated will be filed with Alamosa and Conejos counties. Alamosa County will review the permit application at an upcoming meeting. Conejos County’s Planning Commission will hold a public hearing and then provide a recommendation to the board of county commissioners. The commissioners will decide to approve the application.

The hearings will be scheduled in the coming weeks following the initial review of the application.

Once the permits are approved Xcel will begin working with landowners to purchase easements and begin planning for construction which the release said is expected to begin in late 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vZWFydGhqdXN0aWNlLm9yZy9leHBlcnRzL21pY2hhZWwtaGlhdHQvY29sb3JhZG8taXMtYXQtYS1jcm9zc3JvYWRzLWluLWl0cy1jbGVhbi1lbmVyZ3ktdHJhbnNpdGlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Colorado Is at a Crossroads in Its Clean Energy Transition,"Coal’s days in Colorado are now unequivocally numbered. In August the Colorado Public Utilities Commission set retirement deadlines for Xcel Energy’s remaining coal-fired power plants. This news follows several other recent retirement announcements for coal plants ranging from Fort Collins to Colorado Springs to Craig. The bottom line is that by the end of 2030 there will be no coal plants left operating in Colorado.

The shuttering of Colorado’s coal plants represents a significant milestone in our state’s move to clean energy. In 2020 coal accounted for approximately 36% of Colorado’s electricity generation. Eliminating this coal-fired generation over the coming decade will result in cleaner air for all Coloradans to breathe and significantly less greenhouse gas emissions.

This milestone warrants recognition but turning the page on Colorado’s coal plants is not the end of Colorado’s clean energy story. Two overarching issues will likely drive the next decade’s headlines and work.

First Colorado must make greater and quicker progress on reducing climate pollution beyond the electric sector. In 2020 the transportation sector overtook the electric sector as Colorado’s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. Yet the State’s efforts to reduce emissions from the millions of cars and trucks on Colorado’s roads have been mixed to date. Last year the Colorado Department of Transportation adopted first-of-its-kind transportation planning rules that should help make our state’s transportation sector cleaner and more sustainable and equitable. However the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission has abandoned and delayed several rules over the past year that would reduce pollution from cars and trucks.

Colorado is also in the early stages of decarbonizing the buildings sector. The gas we burn in our homes offices and businesses is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions and can result in unsafe indoor air quality. As solar and wind increasingly power our electric grid we must electrify all the appliances in our buildings that burn gas—such as furnaces stoves and water heaters. Unfortunately the fossil fuel industry is resorting to well-worn tactics to delay this next phase of the clean energy transition. Xcel Energy and other fossil fuel interests have launched a pro-gas front group called “Coloradans for Energy Access.” And in an important test case currently before the Colorado Public Utilities Commission Xcel has fought hard for a $32 million project to expand its gas system in Denver Lakewood and Edgewater rather than implement energy efficiency and beneficial electrification measures to reduce customers’ demand for gas. This gas expansion project and other similar projects risk leaving customers on the hook to pay millions of dollars to expand the gas system although we know today that the gas system will deliver far less fuel and energy in the future.

Second Colorado must ensure that the next phase of the clean energy transition is more equitable than in the past. It is imperative that low-income customers and disproportionately impacted communities have greater access to clean energy technologies and that they are not left behind in the clean energy transition. Rooftop solar community solar energy efficiency and other clean energy technologies decrease customer bills and can help reduce the energy burden customers face by rising energy costs. But for too long low-income customers and disproportionately impacted communities have not received their fair share of these benefits—and instead are forced to spend a greater share of their incomes on energy and transportation costs while suffering from greater exposure to pollution. Colorado must develop robust and well-designed clean energy programs for low-income customers which reflect the needs and desires of these customers and disproportionately impacted communities. Fortunately numerous environmental justice organizations that represent a range of communities of color in Colorado have begun intervening in Colorado Public Utilities Commission proceedings and demanding more equitable access to rooftop solar community solar electric vehicle and battery storage programs. And in an encouraging sign of progress many of these groups recently struck a deal with Xcel that will result in greater and better-designed solar and battery storage programs along with more robust education and outreach from Xcel to disproportionately impacted communities.

As Colorado shutters its coal plants the state is at an important crossroads as it enters the next phase of the clean energy transition. The decisions we make now will determine how quickly we electrify our cars and homes and whether all Coloradans have equitable access to clean energy.

The Cost Share Program evolved from a plan that was advanced by Fresh Energy and partners at All Energy Solar and TruNorth Solar in 2021 and Fresh Energy has been actively engaged in this and related dockets over the past year.

Fresh Energy applauds the Commission for its decision to approve the Cost Share Program and new modifications that balance the interests of Xcel’s distributed energy resource (DER) customers and other rate payers. The group also applauds Commissioner Schuerger for his attention and prioritization of this critical issue.

“The cost of interconnection upgrades has been a major pain point over the years for Xcel Energy customers who install solar but then experience significant surprise costs to connect to the grid” said Isabel Ricker director clean electricity at Fresh Energy. “This new cost-sharing approach will ease the interconnection cost burden for customers and will particularly benefit under-resourced customers who may not have been able to consider solar in the past due to these costs.”

Today most small solar projects connecting to Xcel’s system do not require grid upgrades but in the case upgrades are required the average cost per project is about $3600. The newly approved Cost Share Program for which customers will be eligible starting January 3 2023 will require customers with projects up to 40 kW to pay a single fee of $200 which will cover all upgrade costs up to $15000 per project. Additionally under-resourced or “low-income” customers as designated by the utility will be explicitly exempted from paying this fee.

With the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and additional federal funding for solar Fresh Energy anticipates more residential and business customers within Xcel Energy’s service territory will install solar and this Cost Sharing Program will help to reduce the financial uncertainty of the infrastructure upgrades needed to connect to the grid.

This decision is a big step forward in solving one of the major interconnection issues facing Xcel Energy customers and Fresh Energy is looking forward to continuing to work with the Commission Xcel Energy and solar installers on this docket and other interconnection issues in Docket #16-521 including timeliness and customer service.

In our previous Down to the Wire column we walked through the basics of a new federal loan program aimed at transforming old and dirty energy infrastructure into new and clean energy infrastructure. The Section 1706 program aka the​Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment Program authorized by the Inflation Reduction Act enables the U.S. Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office to make up to $250 billion in loans to companies for qualified projects. The program holds enormous potential to remake the U.S. energy landscape — but in many cases it won’t be simple.

Jigar Shah head of the Loan Programs Office has spent the past two months talking about the wide array of projects that could be eligible for loans under the new program. Examples range from repurposing refineries and pipelines for clean hydrogen or captured carbon dioxide to less certain but possible applications like replacing backup generators with batteries or developing solar farms on decommissioned mining lands.

Some of the Section 1706 loans could be expected to go toward retooling infrastructure controlled by utilities — including state-regulated investor-owned utilities publicly owned utilities and electric cooperatives — and independent energy companies and unregulated arms of larger utility holding companies that operate in competitive markets. Today it can be hard for utilities and independent energy companies to secure cost-effective financing for such projects as repurposing coal plants for clean energy upgrading old transmission corridors to carry more power and restarting shuttered nuclear plants.

But lack of financing is not the only reason these kinds of projects have been challenging to pull off. Simply put there are a lot of moving parts to coordinate in making large-scale changes to long-standing energy infrastructure — and conflicting motives among the players.

Can Section 1706 loans help turn coal plants into clean energy centers?

Take the concept of using Section 1706 loans to reduce the cost of closing down and repurposing coal power plants.

Most U.S. utilities aren’t moving as quickly to close coal plants as needed to forestall the worst impacts of climate change. One big reason is that many utilities are still recouping the cost of building those plants from their customers even if the power the plants produce is more expensive than power from renewable sources.

Over the past decade or so coal-closure proponents have centered around the concept of ​“securitization” as a way to overcome this utility preference for keeping old coal plants running. In simple terms securitization gives utilities a way to raise low-cost debt financing to cover some of the losses they’ll incur by shutting down those plants before they’ve earned back the entirety of the cost of building them. Laws enabling securitization have been passed in a handful of states but they have led to only a few coal plants being closed in Michigan and Wisconsin and none so far in other states such as Colorado and New Mexico.

The Section 1706 program would not offer securitization of debt for such projects but rather ​“repurposing of the asset” Shah said. ​“It can’t be ​‘We want to shut down this coal plant.’ It has to be ​‘We want to turn it into a nuclear plant or a hydrogen facility or a solar-storage site or a manufacturing facility’” to name a few of the potential redevelopment options.

Under Section 1706 the Loan Programs Office could create a nationwide structure to do this offering low-cost financing to cover the more than $100 billion in coal-plant asset value that customers of U.S. utilities are still paying off via their monthly power bills according to nonprofit think tank RMI and replace that coal capacity with clean alternatives. (Canary Media is an independent affiliate of RMI.)

That could reduce electricity costs for utility customers. ​“Over 20 years we could save over $300 billion for ratepayers if it was used for retiring and recycling” coal plants said Ben Serrurier a manager on RMI’s carbon-free electricity team.

Loans for coal-plant redevelopment projects would also spur economic development in coal communities. Community reinvestment is a critical component of any coal-closure scheme that purports to enable a just and equitable energy transition Serrurier said.

The Section 1706 program should be a good tool for doing this. It requires that projects benefit both the community that historically has been supported by a facility and the ratepayers who will rely on the project that retools or replaces it Shah said.

But what investor-owned utilities want what their regulators will allow and what communities need often are not aligned.

When utilities’ interests conflict with communities’ interests

“The utility is most concerned with getting its return on investment back and being done with liabilities” such as the costs of environmental remediation Serrurier said.

Regulators on the other hand are supposed to represent the interests of utility customers and state residents at large. If they’re doing that job right they will be concerned about minimizing costs to customers remediating the environmental damage the coal plants have caused and providing economic-transition funding to communities that have depended on the plants for jobs and tax revenue.

But for an investor-owned utility every dollar that’s dedicated to cleanup or economic redevelopment is a dollar that can’t go toward investments in new projects that would earn the company money. This is one of the key holdups that turns every discussion about coal-plant securitization into a tug-of-war between utilities regulators and other stakeholders.

So while the Section 1706 program could create a nationwide framework for financing that works similarly to securitization including in states that haven’t passed securitization laws it doesn’t resolve the underlying tensions that make this process a challenge.

Ron Binz former chair of the Colorado Public Utilities Commission who now advises on energy-transition matters points out that utilities benefit under the current status quo and might not have enough motivation to close down coal plants early via securitization or a similar new process under Section 1706.

“Right now utilities pretty much have their cake and eat it too when it comes to transition from coal or natural gas to solar or wind” he said. Without regulator pushback utilities would prefer to have their customers continue to pay off the balance of unrecovered coal-plant costs even after they’ve closed while getting approval to earn rates of return from their customers for new clean energy investments as well.

Utilities could be motivated to seek out DOE loans if they fear that regulators won’t approve their proposals to push up customers’ costs Binz said. But it’s hard to predict how utilities and regulators might reach a consensus on whether they’re ready to try Section 1706.

In Arizona for example utility Arizona Public Service has proposed that its customers pay for a $144 million economic-transition plan to help tribes and other communities that have depended on soon-to-close coal plants. Ratepayer advocates argue that the utility’s shareholders rather than its customers should pay for the bulk of the plan. Staff at the Arizona Corporation Commission the state’s utility regulator recently sided with ratepayer advocates.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRnbG9iZS5jb20vc3BvcnRzL3BpcGVzdG9uZS1hcmVhLW1hcnNoYWxsLXNldC11cC1mb3Itc3RhdGUtdm9sbGV5YmFsbC10b3VybmFtZW500gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pipestone Area Marshall set up for state volleyball tournament,"Much has been said and written this fall about the 2022-23 Pipestone Area high school volleyball team. And a lot of it has centered upon the fact that the Arrows are senior-dominated -- the implication being that their experience together made them a particularly dangerous team this year.

The PA roster in fact has 11 seniors on it.

But as everyone knows it’s not enough to have so many seniors. They need to be very talented seniors in order to win the big matches.

Pipestone Area has done just that beating Windom Area in three straight sets last week for the South Section 3AA championship then dispatching Paynesville Area 3-0 Saturday in the section finals. The Arrows will bring a 26-5 record with them into the Minnesota state tournament beginning Thursday.

All state tournament games will be played at Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul.

Pipestone Area which is unseeded will take on second-seeded Cannon Falls at 3 p.m. in a quarterfinal contest. In other Class AA games Pequot Lakes (1) plays Burnsville and Belle Plaine (4) plays Concordia Academy (5) in 1 p.m. games. Annandale (3) plays Rush City in the other 3 p.m. game.

With corner hitter Kyla Hubbling 6-3 middle hitter Arinn McGee and Kyla’s twin sister Kayla Hubbling the Arrows have plenty of firepower at the net. Defensive specialist Callie Lingen setter Megan Lingen and libero Melody Remund round out some of the senior stalwarts.

In Cannon Falls (26-7) the Arrows will face a team that defeated them 2-0 in a regular season tournament.

Two other southwest Minnesota teams competing at state are Minneota in Class A and Marshall in Class AAA.

Both Minneota and Marshall are top-ranked in the state. Marshall is also a defending state champion. Minneota placed second in Class A last year.

The Vikings unsurprisingly are the No. 1 seed in the tournament and they’ll begin Thursday against unseeded New Life Academy starting at 5 p.m. Minneota defeated Russell-Tyler-Ruthton 3-2 to win the Section 3A championship. New Life Academy is 21-11.

Marshall opens Wednesday at 5 p.m. against DeLaSalle. The top-seeded Tigers 30-2 swept all three of its Section 2AAA opponents in three straight sets. Unseeded DeLaSalle is 13-13 on the season.

News of the new Pizza Hut in the Tops Plaza on the Southside was reported earlier this year as part of an announcement from Yum! Brands that 10 new stores would open in “Western New York.”

While many of the traditional sit-down Pizza Huts have closed across the country the restaurant still operates more than 16000 locations many of which offer only the express menu or take-out-only options.

When will Elmira Pizza Hut open?

Darci Smith Senior Director of Marketing/Administration for franchisee Daland Corporation said the take-out-only restaurant is scheduled to open Tuesday Nov. 15 next door to Zoom Tan barring any unforeseen circumstances.

When did the other Pizza Huts in the region close?

Seventeen Pizza Huts including locations in Elmira Corning Bath and Hornell closed permanently in 2020. The company initially closed following the restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic but the local franchisee made the closures permanent.

At the time a Pizza Hut spokesman said it had plans to open new franchises in the region.

Among the restaurants affected at the time were locations at 55 E. Pulteney St. in Corning 1151 Broadway in Elmira 357 W. Morris St. in Bath and 1000 State Route 36 in Hornell.

What will the Elmira Pizza Hut offer?

Smith said the location will offer delivery and carry-out only but will feature an almost-complete menu. Besides pizza patrons can order pasta wings breadsticks cheese sticks desserts and beverages. It also features a drive-thru. The only staple unavailable will be sandwiches.

Are there other Pizza Hut locations in the Southern Tier or Northern Tier of Pennsylvania?

Before the return of Pizza Hut in Elmira the closest full-menu location was in Mansfield a drive of 30 minutes or more from parts of the Elmira area. A Pizza Hut Express inside Target at Big Flats Commons was the lone semblance of the chain in the area since 2020. However the Express locations offer only select items including cheese and pepperoni personal pan pizzas small portions of breadsticks pasta and bone-in wings.

How will you be able to order from the Elmira Pizza Hut?

The Pizza Hut is at 299 South Main St. and customers can order online at pizzahut.com or via the Pizza Hut app.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJha2luZ2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy81NzczNy1yZXN0YXVyYW50LWJyYW5kcy1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLXNlZXMtc3RyZW5ndGgtaW4tZ2xvYmFsLW1hcmtldHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Restaurant Brands International sees strength in global markets,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJha2luZ2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy81NzczNy1yZXN0YXVyYW50LWJyYW5kcy1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLXNlZXMtc3RyZW5ndGgtaW4tZ2xvYmFsLW1hcmtldHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF18473D0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJha2luZ2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy81NzczNy1yZXN0YXVyYW50LWJyYW5kcy1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLXNlZXMtc3RyZW5ndGgtaW4tZ2xvYmFsLW1hcmtldHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vdmVnbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS9iZXlvbmQtbWVhdC0yLW5ldy12ZWdhbi1jaGlja2VuLXByb2R1Y3Rz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Beyond Meat Just Launched 2 New Vegan Chicken Products. Here's Where to Find Them.,"Beyond Meat is rapidly releasing new products to help consumers make cruelty-free choices in every category. This week the brand expanded its plant-based chicken portfolio with the launch of Beyond Popcorn Chicken and Beyond Chicken Nuggets at 5000 Kroger and Walmart stores nationwide along with select locations of Albertsons and Ahold.

The new vegan chicken products feature 50-percent less saturated fat than their animal-derived counterparts while delivering 14 grams of plant protein per serving. And because they are not derived from animals the vegan chicken is free from hormones antibiotics and cholesterol. Sold frozen the new product can be prepared in a few minutes in an air fryer or oven.

Beyond Meat

To promote its newest vegan chicken products Beyond Meat enlisted reality television star and business mogul Kim Kardashian the brand’s Chief Taste Officer.

“As a busy mom I’m always looking for quick and easy options to feed my family that are both healthy and delicious” Kardashian said in a video as she put Beyond Chicken Nuggets in an air fryer. “In less than 10 minutes you can make a delicious plant-based protein option that everyone in the family absolutely loves. It’s the easiest way yet to Go Beyond.”

Beyond Meat

The company created a locator tool to easily track down the availability of the new Beyond Popcorn Chicken and Beyond Chicken Nuggets along with other Beyond Meat products.

Beyond Meat’s new vegan chicken

While Beyond Meat may be best known for its Beyond Burger—a beef alternative it released in 2016—the vegan brand is a major player in other plant-based meat categories including chicken.

Before the Beyond Burger Beyond Meat first launched plant-based chicken pieces in 2012. The company has spent nearly a decade reformulating its chicken portfolio to match consumer preferences as part of what it calls its “commitment to rapid and relentless innovation.”

Last year Beyond Meat first began expanding its vegan chicken offerings with the launch of Beyond Chicken Tenders in the summer of 2021. Prior to making its retail debut the product first launched in 400 restaurants last year including Next Level Burger Dog Haus Epic Burger Toppers Pizza and Fire Wings.

Beyond Meat

Like its tenders the new Beyond Popcorn Chicken and Beyond Chicken Nuggets are made with a base of faba beans and other plant proteins including pea protein. According to Dariush Ajami Beyond Meat’s Chief Innovation Officer these soy-free options can serve as a selling point for some consumers.

“We’re always exploring new plant-based protein sources that deliver the taste and texture of its animal protein equivalent” Ajami said in a statement. “[We] are proud that by using faba bean protein we’ve been able to create a portfolio of absolutely delicious plant-based chicken products with no added soy a key differentiator for our Beyond Chicken products within the category.”

On the foodservice side Beyond Meat has helped several major chains put vegan chicken on the menu. At KFC the vegan company worked to develop Beyond Fried Chicken which the fast-food chain tested to sell-out success but has yet to add to its permanent menu nationwide.

At Panda Express Beyond Meat helped the chain reimagine its most profitable entrée with Beyond the Original Orange Chicken. Panda Express has tested this item in several markets and is currently offering the vegan chicken entrée at all of its locations nationwide for a limited time.

This week Nickelodeon star Kel Mitchell—of iconic teen series Kenan & Kel—appeared in an advertisement to promote the new Beyond the Original Orange Chicken and Panda Express.

Beyond Meat’s vegan steak two ways

The way meat is traditionally produced is inefficient and clunky not to mention cruel to animals. Beyond Meat’s CEO Ethan Brown sees plant-based meat replacing this outdated technology the way cell phones replaced landlines.

And Beyond Meat is working on its mission to make animal products obsolete by developing craveable alternatives across a multitude of categories. The brand’s expansion of its plant-based chicken line closely follows the launch of Beyond Steak its first entry into the vegan steak category in retail. The new product began hitting Kroger and Walmart stores along with other select retailers last month.

Beyond Meat

And similar to its approach with plant-based chicken the brand is also working to get vegan steak on the menu through its foodservice partners. Since March 2021 Beyond Meat has been working closely with Taco Bell under its partnership with parent company Yum! Brands (which also owns KFC and Pizza Hut). Here the Taco Bell culinary team worked to develop a never-before-seen menu item Beyond Carne Asada that just hit test locations last month.

Developed as a vegan alternative to Taco Bell’s animal-derived steak the Beyond Carne Asada is seasoned with the chain’s proprietary spices and is offered as a protein option on any menu item. The best part is that customers will not pay a premium for this plant-based protein a decision Taco Bell made to make the vegan steak accessible and appealing to all.

Taco Bell

The catch? At the moment the only Taco Bell locations offering Beyond Carne Asada are approximately 50 outposts in and around Dayton OH.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmFscHJpbWVuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzExLzA3L2tmYy1wb3Bjb3JuLWJvd2wtbWFkZS13aXRoLW1hZ2dpLXRoZS1jdWx0LWNvbGxhYi13ZXZlLWFsbC1iZWVuLXdhaXRpbmctZm9yL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,KFC POPCORN BOWL MADE WITH MAGGI - THE CULT COLLAB WE’VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR,"The all-new offering brings together KFC’s signature Chicken Popcorn & the nation’s much loved Maggi noodles – for the first time ever!

Adam Christman DVM MBA: Well welcome back everyone. So we're gonna get a little high level overview regarding Zoetis Reference Labs. And of course my friend here Dr. Carolyn Grimes is joining us. Let's get to know her a little bit more. So Dr. Grimes earned her BS in Biology from the University of Notre Dame in 2001. Then her DVM from Purdue University in 2006. She completed a rotating internship in small animal medicine and surgery at Angel animal Medical Center in Boston Massachusetts in 2007. Then practiced for 2 years as a small animal emergency veterinarian at Red Bank Veterinary Hospital in New Jersey. She completed a residency in Clinical Pathology at the University of Tennessee in 2012. Then joined the faculty at the University of Montreal where she worked in the clinical laboratory taught in the veterinary curriculum and did research that focused mainly on the metal pathology and optimization of hematology analyzers. In 2017 she left the frigid north and worked for ethos diagnostic science as the director of the San Diego laboratory until this lab was acquired by Zoetis in 2020. Dr. Grimes served as a director of quality assurance for Zoetis Reference Laboratories from 2020 to 2021 and was promoted to medical director in January 2021. Her professional passions include quality assurance hematology organized veterinary medicine and education. In her free time she enjoys reading running CrossFit swimming cooking birdwatching spending time with her husband 2 young boys and cat rooting for the Red Sox. She had her family moved to New Hampshire in 2020 where she enjoys exploring the sea coast and in the winter complaining about the cold. Well that keeps you busy right. Mike drop. Well talk to me a little bit about Zoetis Reference Labs overview overall because it's a relatively newer venture. And so just you know give me a little high-level overview of what they have to offer and how that comes to fruition.

Carolyn Grimes DVM DACVP (Clinical Pathology): So veterinarians don't have a lot of options when it comes to choosing a reference laboratory. And Zoetis felt that the time was right for a disruptor in the market. Zoetis is the largest animal health company in the world. They've got a really deep roster of creative thinkers and innovators and people who know the industry understand the market and understand veterinarians. And so they felt I think that it was time to come in and shake up that market.

Adam Christman DVM MBA: Yeah it's really interesting. So as a general practitioner do they offer the same services that I would expect for other reference labs like this CBC chemistry UA...?

Carolyn Grimes DVM DACVP (Clinical Pathology): Yeah of course we're a full-service reference laboratory. And so everything that you would expect from a reference laboratory the majority of that we run in house.

Adam Christman DVM MBA: So are there consultations that are involved too should I have like a struggle with a case or bloodwork or any of those kinds?

Carolyn Grimes DVM DACVP (Clinical Pathology): Yeah we've got a an awesome...and in fact the global consulting service that services not only our reference laboratory customers but also our point of care customers and so in our virtual lab laboratory customers so any customer of any product in the in the Zoetis diagnostics portfolio has access to these customers to these consultants for the consulting service. We have several internal medicine specialists then we also have dermatologists exotic specialists ophthalmology so pretty much any specialty that you would need to consult on large animal and and again if you have some results from your from your in house point of care analyzer and some results from as well as reference labs you know that same consultant can I can help any of those.

Adam Christman DVM MBA: That's fantastic. And especially now when we want answers a lot of our pet parents want the answers kind of yesterday. And it sounds like the turnaround time is relatively quickly which is great. So we know what we're doing. And then you also mentioned a bit about a virtual component right?

Carolyn Grimes DVM DACVP (Clinical Pathology): With the virtual laboratories is a separate a separate laboratory service rooms what is reference laboratory which is our brick and mortar laboratory service. And the virtual laboratory and ref reference laboratory can complement the complement one another. But they are there. They're 2 separate entities within Zoetis diagnostics.

Adam Christman DVM MBA: Excellent. That's fantastic. I understand that you have an incredible medical leadership team that's there as well. Right?

Carolyn Grimes DVM DACVP (Clinical Pathology): Yeah. I'm very very proud of our medical leadership team. So Dr. Sam Jennings is our Director of Anatomic Pathology. Dr. Laura Brandt is Director of Clinical Pathology Dr. Shelley Rankin Director of of Molecular Microbiology and Molecular Diagnostics. Jenny Dawson is our Director of Quality Assurance we have Dr. Sandy Willis as an internist who who bridges communication between the medical leadership team our consultants and our customer other customer facing colleagues. And we're bringing on ahead of parasitology in the upcoming months between the 6 or 7 of us. Between the 6 of us we have over 100 years of combined experience much of that in the academic sector. So we have a team that is not only knowledgeable and expert in their in their specialty but also very very committed to to education and helping veterinarians get the most out of their diagnostics.

Through its close partnership with Beyond Blue the grand total has now reached $700000 since the joint campaign started in 2016 as Zoetis continues to commit its support for the mental health organisation.

Zoetis achieved its goal by donating $5 from each sale of the company’s cattle sheep pig and poultry and goat vaccines and drenches. The funds have gone directly to the Beyond Blue Support Service to continue supporting people including those living in remote areas by providing free advice counselling and referrals 24 hours a day seven days a week. Thanks to Zoetis’ donations more than 14500 people have been able to get the support they need through the Beyond Blue service.

Zoetis senior vice president Lance Williams said it was an honour for the company to once again achieve its fundraising goal with Beyond Blue for the great initiative.

“At Zoetis we recognise the importance of improving mental health reducing the stigma around mental health and tackling the tragedy of suicide which disproportionately affect people in regional and rural areas.

“People living in rural areas face a number of challenges which can take a toll on their wellbeing including disasters economic change isolation limited access to services and most recently the pandemic. Together we have made strong progress in supporting the mental health and wellbeing of those who live in rural Australia and we are passionate about continuing to help.”

Remoteness is a major risk factor contributing to suicide and the likelihood that someone will die by suicide appears to increase the further away from a city they live. Considering the vastness of Australia and the number of people who live in regional and rural areas it’s a concerning fact that remoteness is a major risk factor contributing to mental health issues and suicide with the suicide rates being 60 percent higher than rates in major cities. In addition people in outer regional remote or very remote areas of Australia face more barriers to accessing health care than people living in major cities making it harder for them to maintain good mental health.

Beyond Blue Chief Community Officer Patrice O’Brien says demand for Beyond Blue’s support services increased 20 per cent during the pandemic and remains higher than pre-pandemic times.

“We know that people are doing it tough right now and ongoing impacts of the pandemic cost of living pressure and extreme weather events will continue to affect people’s mental health” she said.

”There are some indicators to look for if you think a family member friend or colleague might need help.

Ms O’Brien said sadness and worry are normal human emotions and we all have our ups and downs.

“However if the behaviour has been going on for two to three weeks then a quiet conversation might help” she said.

“Such behaviours might include a drop in their performance at work they may be getting into conflicts they might be withdrawn not sleeping or there might be drug or alcohol use.”

Farmers wear ‘many hats’

Derek Schoen Beyond Blue Board Director and beef grain and hay producer in Corowa New South Wales said farmers have to wear many hats as part of their role.

“Modern farmers have to juggle multiple roles such as production and HR management you have to be a tech expert and need to understand international markets while also running the business. Adding to this is the additional stress of fire drought flooding and COVID- 19 related issues” he said.

“People in rural Australia are known for their resilience in times of crisis but even the most resilient among us need extra support at times. We want everyone to know that support is available and encourage people to seek advice. Asking for support is a sign of strength – not weakness.

“If you think someone needs your help you don’t need to be a psychologist to ask someone how things are going and listen to their concerns. Your conversation can take place while you are doing something together like driving or fixing something.

“Be prepared for the person to say they don’t wish to have a discussion as many people in rural areas are self-reliant. However if they do want to talk you don’t have to be a psychologist; you don’t need to respond just sit and listen and ask how you can help them.

“Having a conversation can make a huge difference to someone’s life.”

Zoetis and Beyond Blue’s mental health initiative shines a spotlight on the higher suicide risk posed to the farming community.

Ms O’Brien thanked Zoetis for its efforts in supporting this important cause. “We are honoured to receive such wonderful support each year with all funds raised going towards the Beyond Blue Support Service. As well as the importance of the funds raised Zoetis’ support of Beyond Blue in rural and regional communities ensures that more people in those communities are aware of our services being available to them which is so important” she said said.

Just because some workers are returning to the office doesn't mean that spending on pets has gone away.

Two out of three U.S. households own a pet according to the American Pet Products Association (APPA). Plus the number of pets is increasing as is the willingness to spend on pet care. In the U.S. pet spending totaled $123.6 billion in 2021 according to the APPA up from $103.6 billion in 2020 and marked the second consecutive record year.

Livestock care is also big business with emerging markets (such as China and India) increasing their protein demand. Global meat consumption is expected to hit between 460 million and 570 million metric tons a year by 2050 according to Statista.

Zoetis (ZTS 1.95%) and Chewy (CHWY 6.22%) are two of the bigger names respectively in animal medicines and pet products. Let's see how they could benefit.

Zoetis shows consistent growth

Zoetis operates in more than 100 countries and has over 12000 employees making vaccines medicines and diagnostic products to treat pets and livestock. It sells some 300 products across seven therapeutic areas for eight animal species.

Shares of the company are down more than 46% this year but to me that just presents a better price point to get in on a solid company with sound fundamentals. The company has increased revenue and earnings per share (EPS) for six consecutive years.

For the just-reported third quarter Zoetis had revenue of $2 billion up 1% year over year. Net income totaled $529 million which was flat sequentially but down 4% over the same period last year. Earnings per share (EPS) were also flat sequentially but down 2.5%.

Through the first nine months the company had revenue of $6.04 billion up 4% year over year. Net income came to $1.653 billion up 2% over the same period of 2021 and EPS of $3.51 was up 3%.

For all of 2022 the company downgraded earlier revenue predictions saying it now expects revenue of $8 billion to $8.075 billion and EPS of $4.51 to $4.59. That compares to 2021 revenue of $7.8 billion and EPS of $4.27.

While the dividend yield is relatively low -- roughly 0.99% -- the company has raised its payout by 225% over the past five years. Zoetis increased its quarterly dividend by 30% this year to $0.325 per share the fifth consecutive year it has increased its payout.

Chewy has delivered for shareholders

Online retailer Chewy has focused on delivering topnotch e-commerce customer service for pet products including pet food delivery and it also sells prescription medicines for animals.

The stock is down some 39% so far in 2022 but over the past three years it has risen more than 55% and its recent results look encouraging.

Over the past year Chewy has increased the number of active customers to 20.5 million. As it has increased in size the company said it has found ways to save money on its shipping. It has improved its supply chain with an updated inventory system that cut down the typical delivery distance -- saving money on fuel and improving delivery times.

In the second quarter Chewy reported revenue of $2.43 billion up 12.8% year over year with net income of $22.3 million compared to a loss of $16.6 million in the same period a year ago. The average active Chewy customer spent $462 over the past 12 months up 14.4% over the same period last year.

Over the past decade the company has grown revenue 887%. One key for Chewy is its Autoship system which gives consumers discounts if they set up automatic renewals of pet supplies including medicines. That reduces customer turnover. The percentage of sales that come from Autoship has grown to 73.1% from 70.3% in the second quarter of 2021.

The company is also expanding its pet health offerings. On Oct. 20 it announced a partnership with Lemonade to offer pet insurance.

Two recession-resistant companies

Pet healthcare spending like human healthcare is somewhat recession resistant. Pets are increasingly viewed as essential members of the family and when Fido or Kitty needs medical attention it isn't seen as optional even in recessionary periods.

The well-being of livestock is also an essential activity for global food production regardless of the ups and downs of the macro-economy.

There is plenty of competition in the industry so neither stock enjoys a moat but they do have the edge in market share over competitors -- and provide widely needed products and services.",,,
